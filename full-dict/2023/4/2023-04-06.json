    "abstract": "The quorum sensing two-component system (TCS) QseBC has been linked to virulence, motility and metabolism regulation in multiple Gram-negative pathogens, including Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) and Salmonella enterica. In EHEC, the sensor histidine kinase (HK) QseC detects the quorum sensing signalling molecule AI-3 and also acts as an adrenergic sensor binding host epinephrine and norepinephrine. Downstream changes in gene expression are mediated by phosphorylation of its cognate response regulator (RR) QseB, and cross-talk with non-cognate regulators KdpE and QseF to activate motility and virulence. In UPEC, cross-talk between QseBC and TCS PmrAB is crucial in the regulation and phosphorylation of QseB RR that acts as a repressor of multiple pathways, including motility. Here, we investigated QseBC regulation of motility in the atypical Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) strain O125ac:H6, causative agent of persistent diarrhoea in children, and its possible cross-talk with the KdpDE and PmrAB TCS. We showed that in EPEC QseB acts as a repressor of genes involved in motility, virulence and stress response, and in absence of QseC HK, QseB is activated by the non-cognate PmrB HK, similarly to UPEC. We show that in absence of QseC, phosphorylated QseB activates its own expression, and is responsible for the low motility phenotypes seen in a QseC deletion mutant. Furthermore, we showed that KdpD HK regulates motility in an independent manner to QseBC and through a third unidentified party different to its own response regulator KdpE. We showed that PmrAB has a role in iron adaptation independent to QseBC. Finally, we showed that QseB is the responsible for activation of colistin and polymyxin B resistance genes while PmrA RR acts by preventing QseB binding to the promoter of polymyxin resistance genes.\n\nAuthor summaryEnteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a human pathogen and the leading cause of diarrhoea in children under 5 years in low-income countries. EPEC, and specially the subgroup denominated atypical EPEC, has been associated with community-acquired persistent diarrhoea and also is an important agent of post-weaning diarrhoea in young piglets. Two-component systems (TCS) are signalling system used by bacteria to sense and adapt to different stimuli. Bacteria use TCS to detect host signals as queues to exert virulence in their preferred niche. QseBC is a TCS that has been linked to regulation of motility and virulence in other pathogenic E. coli. In this study we broaden our understanding of QseBC TCS and its role in regulating virulence traits such as motility in atypical EPEC. We also investigate its capabilities to interact with other TCS, named KdpDE and PmrAB, and how these interactions are responsible for regulation of motility and resistance to antimicrobials such as colistin.",

    "abstract": "The risk of disease spread is contingent on not only the biological properties of causal agents, such as viruses and bacteria, but also the socio-ecological context of the outbreak. Therefore, researchers need to incorporate the variation in animal-animal interactions in models of disease spread. Much research has focused on how ecological factors (seasonality, mating systems) can influence the variation in animal interactions, but heterogeneity in interactions may arise due to human action, and this has received little attention. We hypothesised that social-mediated differences in the landscape can have consequences for interactions for free-roaming dogs and consequently for disease spread. We used GPS collared data from 31 free-ranging dogs present along a farm-village gradient to build social contact networks to examine differences in interactions. Additionally, we simulated scenarios of rabies infection of two types - dumb and furious - on the contact network structure of village and farm dogs. We found significant differences in the node degree between village and farm contact networks, but the node betweenness was similar. Our simulations showed that infections arising in village dogs are likely to spread to that network, but infections arising in farm dogs get are less likely to spread. Interestingly, this was independent of the type of rabies infection. We discuss our results in light of control strategies for managing rabies in the tropics.",

    "abstract": "Leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) are top predators that can exert substantial top-down control of their Antarctic prey species. However, population trends and genetic diversity of leopard seals remain understudied, limiting our understanding of their ecological role. We investigated the genetic diversity, effective population size and demographic history of leopard seals to provide fundamental data that contextualizes their predatory influence on Antarctic ecosystems. Ninety leopard seals were sampled in the northern Antarctic Peninsula, during the austral summers of 2008-2019 and a 405bp region of the mitochondrial control region was sequenced for each individual. We uncovered moderate levels of nucleotide ({pi} = 0.013) and haplotype (Hd = 0.96) diversity, and the effective population size was estimated at around 24,000 individuals (NE = 24,376; range 16,876 - 33,126). Consistent with findings from other ice-breeding pinnipeds, Bayesian skyline analysis also revealed evidence for population expansion during the last glacial maximum, suggesting that historical population growth may have been boosted by an increase in the abundance of sea ice. Although leopard seals can be found in warmer, sub-Antarctic locations, the species core habitat is centered around the Antarctic, making it inherently vulnerable to the loss of sea ice habitat due to climate change. Therefore, detailed assessments of past and present leopard seal population trends are needed to inform policies for Antarctic ecosystems.",

Here we first develop uCoTarget, utilizing a split-pool barcoding strategy for realizing ultra-high throughput single-cell joint profiling of multiple epigenetic proteins. Through extensive optimization for sensitivity and multimodality resolution, we demonstrate that uCoTarget enables simultaneous detection of five histone modifications (H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K36me3 and H3K27me3) in 19,860 single cells. We applied uCoTarget to the in vitro generation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from human embryonic stem cells, presenting multimodal epigenomic profiles in 26,418 single cells. uCoTarget with high sensitivity per modality reveals establishment of pairing of HSPC enhancers (H3K27ac) and promoters (H3K4me3) along the differentiation trajectory and RUNX1 engagement priming for the H3K27ac activation along the HSPC path. We then develop uCoTargetX, an expansion of uCoTarget to simultaneously measure transcriptome and multiple epigenome targets. Together, our methods enable generalizable, versatile multi-modal profiles for reconstructing comprehensive epigenome and transcriptome landscapes and analyzing the regulatory interplay at single-cell level.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical properties of DNA have been implied to influence many its biological functions. Recently, a new high-throughput method, called loop-seq, that allows measuring the intrinsic bendability of DNA fragments, has been developed. Using loop-seq data, we created a deep learning model to explore the biological significance of local DNA flexibility in a range of different species from different kingdoms. Consistently, we observed a characteristic and largely nucleotide-composition-driven change of local flexibility near transcription start sites. No evidence of a generally present region of lowered flexibility upstream of transcription start sites to facilitate transcription factor binding was found. Yet, depending on the actual transcription factor investigated, flanking-sequence-dependent DNA flexibility was identified as a potential factor influencing binding. Compared to randomized genomic sequences, depending on species and taxa, actual genomic sequences were observed both with increased and lowered flexibility. Furthermore, in Arabidopsis thaliana, crossing-over and mutation rates, both de novo and fixed, were found to be linked to rigid sequence regions. Our study presents a range of significant correlations between characteristic DNA mechanical properties and genomic features, the significance of which with regard to detailed molecular relevance awaits further experimental and theoretical exploration.",

    "abstract": "Excision of the initiator methionine is among the first co-translational processes that occur at the ribosome. While this crucial step in protein maturation is executed by two types of methionine aminopeptidases in eukaryotes (MAP1 and MAP2), additional roles in disease and translational regulation have drawn more attention to MAP2. Here, we report several cryo-EM structures of MAP2 at the 80S-ribosome. The MAP2 interaction is highly robust but can be perturbed by emerging nascent chains, which induce an adaptive tilting of the enzyme. In rotation, the MAP2-specific N-terminal extension engages in stabilizing interactions with the long rRNA expansion segment ES27L. Loss of this extension by autoproteolytic cleavage impedes the tunnel interaction, while promoting MAP2 to enter the ribosomal A-site, where it engages with crucial functional centers of translation. These findings reveal that proteolytic remodeling of MAP2 severely affects ribosome binding, and set the stage for targeted functional studies.",

Up to now, it has not been demonstrated yet how to effectively translate the successes of LLMs in the computer vision field to the medical imaging field which involves high-dimensional and multi-modal medical images. In this paper, we report a feasibility study of building a multi-task CT large image-text (LIT) model for lung cancer diagnosis by combining an LLM and a large image model (LIM). Specifically, the LLM and LIM are used as encoders to perceive multi-modal information under task-specific text prompts, which synergizes multi-source information and task-specific and patient-specific priors for optimized diagnostic performance. The key components of our LIT model and associated techniques are evaluated with an emphasis on 3D lung CT analysis. Our initial results show that the LIT model performs multiple medical tasks well, including lung segmentation, lung nodule detection, and lung cancer classification. Active efforts are in progress to develop large image-language models for superior medical imaging in diverse applications and optimal patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "MotivationUnderstanding metal-protein interaction can provide structural and functional insights into cellular processes. As the number of protein sequences increases, developing fast yet precise computational approaches to predict and annotate metal binding sites becomes imperative. Quick and resource-efficient pre-trained protein language model (PLM) embeddings have successfully predicted binding sites from protein sequences despite not using structural or evolutionary features (multiple sequence alignments). Using residue-level embeddings from the PLMs, we have developed a sequence-based method (M-Ionic) to identify metal-binding proteins and predict residues involved in metal-binding.\n\nResultsOn independent validation of recent proteins, M-Ionic reports an area under the curve (AUROC) of 0.83 (recall=84.6%) in distinguishing metal-binding from non-binding proteins compared to AUROC of 0.74 (recall =61.8%) of the next best method. In addition to comparable performance to the state-of-the-art method for identifying metal-binding residues (Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+), M-Ionic provides binding probabilities for six additional ions (i.e., Cu2+, Po43-, So42-, Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+). We show that the PLM embedding of a single residue contains sufficient information about its neighbours to predict its binding properties.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationM-Ionic can be used on your protein of interest using a Google Colab Notebook (https://bit.ly/40FrRbK).

A candidate gene for Un8 resistance was used to develop a genetic marker which was tested on a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the resistant  CDC Freedom and the susceptible  Samson varieties. The RIL population (98 lines) was phenotyped for resistance to true loose smut by artificial inoculation and genotyped with the newly developed marker. The genotyping results obtained with the marker developed in this study were mostly consistent with true loose smut resistance determined by artificial inoculation. The markers was also tested in additional barley cultivars and breeding material. Repeated analysis of inconsistent results is required to confirm or revise these results, as well as further investigation of the candidate gene to confirm its role in barley true loose smut resistance is being planned.",

It is enhanced by insulin resistivity and linked with various metabolic syndromes in human being such as renal, neuro-degenerative, and cardiovascular diseases. The primary mechanism through which TMAOs promotes disease is not clear yet. TMAO with MW= 75.11 g/mol is a small biomolecule hence, it becomes crucial to develop the conjugate of TMAO with BSA for aptamer synthesis. The binding interactions among TMAO and BSA were investigated using spectroscopic methods like UV-Vis, photoluminescence, Fourier transform infrared and circular dichroism. Hydrophilicity/Hydrophobicity of the conjugate was monitored by using contact angle ([O]) measurement. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacryl amide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) confirmed the different ratio of conjugate formation with the help of band size. This interaction study reveals that TMAO bind with BSA on two sites and with high affinity on one site. Docking studies also showed TMAO is involved in non-covalent interaction with bovine serum albumin forming stable docking complex with binding score of -3.6 kcal/mol obtained from the docking simulation. TMAO is involved in interaction with BSA via amino acid residues forming the stable docking complex through hydrogen bond and electrostatic interaction. This kind of interaction study may be helpful in making strategies to break the conjugation between serum albumin and uremic toxin and pave the way for the treatment for CKD and other diseases wherein TMAO is implicated. Also, conjugation of TMAO and BSA studied here may also serve as premise to develop aptamers for the detection of TMAO in the body fluids.",

    "abstract": "As a functional component of erythrocyte hemoglobin, iron is essential for oxygen delivery to all tissues in the body. The liver-derived peptide hepcidin is the master regulator of iron homeostasis. During anemia, the erythroid hormone erythroferrone regulates hepcidin synthesis to ensure adequate supply of iron to the bone marrow for red blood cells production. However, mounting evidence suggested that another factor may exert a similar function. We identified the hepatokine FGL1 as a previously undescribed suppressor of hepcidin that is induced in the liver in response to hypoxia during the recovery from anemia and in thalassemic mice. We demonstrated that FGL1 is a potent suppressor of hepcidin in vitro and in vivo. Deletion of Fgl1 in mice results in a blunted repression of hepcidin after bleeding. FGL1 exerts its activity by direct binding to BMP6, thereby inhibiting the canonical BMP-SMAD signaling cascade that controls hepcidin transcription.\n\nKey points1/ FGL1 regulates iron metabolism during the recovery from anemia.\n\n2/ FGL1 is an antagonist of the BMP/SMAD signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction is considered a biomarker of several pathological conditions, including age-associated neurodegenerations, glioblastoma and COVID-19. Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are specialized neurons that detect odorants and send olfactory information to the brain through the olfactory bulb. To perform their function, they are in direct contact with the environment, where they are exposed to several environmental toxins such as atmospheric levels of O2 and volatile molecules. Nonetheless, very little is known about DNA damage levels and expression of DNA repair pathways in these cells. Here we measured nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage in olfactory epithelium (OE) and compared with levels detected in olfactory bulb (OB) and temporal cortex (TC), as a non-olfactory related central nervous system region. Surprisingly, DNA damage was lower in OE and OB when compared with TC, both for nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Accordingly, expression of representative genes for all excision repair pathways was detected in OSNs. Moreover, expression of most evaluated DNA repair genes was lower in mature versus OSN progenitors, suggesting that DNA repair is downregulated during differentiation. Analysis of single cell expression data confirmed that expression of the most differentially expressed DNA repair genes decreased from progenitor to mature OSNs. Finally, in situ hybridization data showed that APE1 mRNA levels are lower in the mature OSNs layer of the olfactory epithelium, closest to the nasal cavity lumen. Altogether, we show here that DNA repair pathways are relevant in protecting OSNs against DNA damage accumulation and that differentiation through the OE is accompanied by changes in the expression levels of DNA repair genes.",

The subtype identity and functions are, at least in part, associated with their anatomical location and can be highly restricted to strategically important anatomical domains. Here, we report that astrocytes forming the glia limitans superficialis, the outermost border of brain and spinal cord, are a highly specialized astrocyte subtype and can be identified by a single marker: Myocilin (Myoc). We show that Myoc+ astrocytes cover the entire brain and spinal cord surface, exhibit an atypical morphology, and are evolutionarily conserved from rodents to humans.

While most computational studies on electrophysiological variability in neuronal circuits were done with simplified neuron models, we instead focus on the variability of detailed biophysical models of neurons. With measures of experimental variability, we leverage a Markov chain Monte Carlo method to generate populations of electrical models able to reproduce the variability from sets of experimental recordings. By matching input resistances of soma and axon initial segments with the one of dendrites, we produce a compatible set of morphologies and electrical models that faithfully represent a given morpho-electrical type. We demonstrate our approach on layer 5 pyramidal cells with continuous adapting firing type and show that morphological variability is insufficient to reproduce electrical variability.

Cilia are important for communicating with the cells immediate environment: signal reception and transduction to/from the ciliated cell. Deregulation of ciliary signaling can lead to ciliopathies and certain neurodevelopmental disorders. In the developing brain cilia play well-documented roles for the expansion of the neural progenitor cell pool, while information about the roles of cilia during post-mitotic neuron differentiation and maturation is scarce. We employed ciliated Lund Human Mesencephalic (LUHMES) cells in time course experiments to assess the impact of ciliary signaling on neuron differentiation. By comparing ciliated and non-ciliated neuronal precursor cells and neurons in wild type and a mutant with altered cilia (RFX2 -/-), we discovered an early-differentiation \"ciliary time window\" during which transient cilia promote axon outgrowth, branching and arborization. Cilia promote neuron differentiation by tipping WNT signaling toward the non-canonical pathway, in turn activating WNT pathway output genes implicated in cyto-architectural changes. We provide a mechanistic entry point into when and how ciliary signaling coordinates, promotes and translates into anatomical changes. We hypothesize that ciliary alterations causing neuron differentiation defects may result in \"mild\" impairments of brain development, possibly underpinning certain aspects of neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "2.Bacteria from the Vibrionaceae family have been implicated in mass mortalities of farmed Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) in multiple countries, leading to substantial impairment for growth in the sector. In Ireland there has been concern that Vibrio have been involved in serious summer outbreaks. There is evidence that Vibrio aestuarianus is increasingly becoming the main pathogen of concern for the Pacific Oyster industry in Ireland. While bacteria belonging to the Vibrio splendidus clade are also detected frequently in mortality episodes, their role in the outbreaks of summer mortality are not well understood. To identify and characterise strains involved in these outbreaks, 43 Vibrio isolates were recovered from Pacific oyster summer mass mortality episodes in Ireland from 2008-2015 and these were whole genome sequenced. Among these, 25 were found to be V. aestuarianus (implicated in disease) and 18 V. splendidus sensu lato (role in disease undetermined). Two distinct clades of V. aestuarianus - Clade A and Clade B - were found that had previously been described as circulating within French oyster culture. The high degree of similarity between the Irish and French V. aestuarianus isolates points to translocation of the pathogen between Europes two major oyster producing countries, probably via trade in spat and other age classes. V. splendidus isolates were more diverse, but the data reveal a single clone of this species that has spread across oyster farms in Ireland. This underscores that Vibrio could be transmitted readily across oyster farms. The presence of V. aestuarianus Clades A and B in not only France but also Ireland adds weight to growing concern that this pathogen is spreading and impacting Pacific oyster production within Europe.\n\n3. OutcomePacific oyster culture in Ireland has increasingly suffered from summer mass mortality events. Many of these mortalities in recent years have been associated with Vibrio aestuarianus; the role of another pathogen, Vibrio splendidus has, so far, remained inconclusive. Here we show that two clades of V. aestuarianus are circulating in Ireland, and that these are members of two clades that have previously caused extensive oyster die offs in France. Their discovery in Ireland is consistent with transport of infected oyster stock between the two countries. Although V. splendidus-like strains in Ireland were highly diverse, a small clonal group was detected that appears to have spread rapidly from a single source to disparate locations in Ireland. Combined, these findings highlight the appearance of a highly pathogenic Vibrio in Ireland, and the risk of transmission between interconnected oyster production industries in Europe.\n\n4.

    "abstract": "Bacteria contain many different receptor families that sense different signals permitting an optimal adaptation to the environment. A major limitation in microbiology is the lack of information on the signal molecules that activate receptors. Due to a significant sequence divergence, the signal recognized by sensor domains is only poorly reflected in overall sequence identity. Biogenic amines are of central physiological relevance for microorganisms and serve for example as substrates for aerobic and anaerobic growth, neurotransmitters or osmoprotectants. Based on protein structural information and sequence analysis, we report here the identification of a sequence motif that is specific for amine-sensing dCache sensor domains (dCache_1AM). These domains were identified in more than 13,000 proteins from 8,000 bacterial and archaeal species. dCache_1AM containing receptors were identified in all major receptor families including sensor kinases, chemoreceptors, receptors involved in second messenger homeostasis and Ser/Thr phosphatases. The screening of compound libraries and microcalorimetric titrations of selected dCache_1AM domains confirmed their capacity to specifically bind amines. Mutants in the amine binding motif or domains that contain a single mismatch in the binding motif, had either no or a largely reduced affinity for amines, illustrating the specificity of this motif. We demonstrate that the dCache_1AM domain has evolved from the universal amino acid sensing domain, providing novel insight into receptor evolution. Our approach enables precise \"wet\"-lab experiments to define the function of regulatory systems and thus holds a strong promise to address an important bottleneck in microbiology: the identification of signals that stimulate numerous receptors.",

Twenty-five young adults were divided into RT+ET (n=13), which underwent seven weeks of RT followed by seven weeks of ET, and ET-only (n=12), which performed seven weeks of ET. Body composition, endurance performance, and muscle biopsies were collected before RT (T1, baseline for RT+ET), before ET (T2, post RT for RT+ET and baseline for ET), and after ET (T3). Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), myonuclear content, myonuclear domain size, satellite cell number, and mitochondrial content. Western blots were used to quantify markers of mitochondrial remodeling. Citrate synthase activity and markers of ribosome content were also investigated. Resistance training improved body composition and strength, increased vastus lateralis thickness, mixed and type II fCSA, myonuclear number, markers of ribosome content, and satellite cell content (p<0.050). In response to ET, both groups similarly decreased body fat percentage and improved endurance performance (e.g., VO2max, and speed at which the onset of blood lactate accumulation occurred during the VO2max test). Levels of mitochondrial complexes I-IV in the ET-only group increased 32-66%, while the RT+ET group increased 1-11%. Additionally, mixed fiber relative mitochondrial content increased 15% in the ET-only group but decreased 13% in the RT+ET group. In conclusion, RT performed prior to ET had no additional benefits to ET adaptations. Moreover, prior RT seemed to impair mitochondrial adaptations to ET.\n\nKEY POINTS SUMMARYO_LIResistance training is largely underappreciated as a method to improve endurance performance, despite reports showing it may improve mitochondrial function.\nC_LIO_LIAlthough several concurrent training studies are available, in this study we investigated the effects of performing a period resistance training on the performance and molecular adaptations to subsequent endurance training.\nC_LIO_LIPrior resistance training did not improve endurance performance and impaired most mitochondrial adaptations to subsequent endurance training, but that seemed to be a result of detraining from resistance training.\nC_LI",

Accordingly, mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) die when SETD1A is removed. We report that death is accompanied by loss of expression of DNA repair genes and accumulating DNA damage. BOD1L and BOD1 are homologs of the yeast Set1C subunit, Shg1, and subunits of the mammalian SETD1A and B complexes. We show that the Shg1 homology region binds to a highly conserved central -helix in SETD1A and B. Like mutagenesis of Shg1 in yeast, conditional mutagenesis of Bod1l in ESCs promoted increased H3K4 di- and tri-methylation but also, like loss of SETD1A, loss of expression of DNA repair genes, increased DNA damage and cell death. In contrast to similar losses of gene expression, the converse changes in H3K4 methylation implies that H3K4 methylation is not essential for expression of the DNA repair network genes. Because BOD1L becomes highly phosphorylated after DNA damage and acts to protect damaged replication forks, the SETD1A complex and BOD1L in particular are key nodes for the DNA damage repair network.",

    "abstract": "Cooperation usually becomes harder to sustain as groups become larger because incentives to shirk increase with the number of potential contributors to a collective action. But is this always the case? Here we study a binary-action cooperative dilemma where a public good is provided only when at most a fixed number of players shirk from a costly, cooperative task. An example is a group of prey which succeeds to drive a predator away only if few group members refrain from engaging in conspicuous mobbing. We find that at the stable polymorphic equilibrium, which exists when the cost of cooperation is low enough, the probability of cooperating increases with group size and reaches a limit of one when the group size tends to infinity. Nevertheless, increasing the group size may increase or decrease the probability that the public good is provided at such equilibrium. We also prove that the expected payoff to individuals at the stable equilibrium (i.e., their fitness) decreases with group size. For costs of cooperation that are low enough, both the probability of provision of the public good and the expected payoff converge to positive values in the limit of large group sizes. However, we also find that the basin of attraction of the stable polymorphic equilibrium is a decreasing function of group size and shrinks to zero in the limit of very large groups.

    "abstract": "Despite increasing interest for the carbon footprint of higher education institutions, little is known about the carbon footprint associated to research activities. Air travel and attendance to conferences concentrate recent data and debates but purchases have attracted little attention. Here we develop a hybrid method to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated to research purchases. To do so, we combine macroe-conomic databases, research-centered companies footprints and life-cycle assesments to construct a public database of monetary emission factors (EF) for research purchases. We apply it to estimate the purchases emissions of a hundred of research laboratories in France, belonging to the Labos 1point5 network and gathering more than 20000 staff, from all disciplines. We find that purchases dominate laboratory emissions, accounting for more than 50% of emissions, with a median of 2.7 t CO2e/pers, which is 3 to 4-fold the separate contribution from travel, commutes and heating. Median electricity emissions are 5-fold lower in our dataset of laboratories using low carbon electricity but they become preponderant for high carbon electricity mixes (3.5 t CO2e/pers). Purchases emissions are very heterogeneous among laboratories and are linearly correlated with budget, with an average carbon intensity of 0.31 {+/-} 0.07 kg CO2e/{euro} and differences between research domains. Finally, we quantify the effect of a series of demand-driven mitigation strategies obtaining up to -20 % in total emissions (-40 % in purchases emissions), suggesting that effectively reducing the carbon footprint of research activities calls for systemic changes.\n\nSignificance statementResearch activities are recently interrogating their contribution to global warming, mainly through the impact of air travel but neglecting the emissions embodied in scientific purchases. However, goods and services used in a research laboratory emit greenhouse gases when they are produced. Here we construct a public and robust database of emission factors to quantify purchases emissions in a laboratory and we use it to assess emissions from a hundred of laboratories in France, from all disciplines. We find that purchases emissions represent half of the of the 6.3 t CO2e/pers per year emitted on average per laboratory. Emissions, however, vary greatly between laboratories and disciplines and an analysis of mitigation strategies shows that decreasing demand may significantly reduce purchases emissions.",

    "abstract": "The sensitivity of systems biology models to parameter variation can give insights into which parameters are most important for physiological function, and also direct efforts to estimate parameters. However, in general, kinetic models of biochemical systems do not remain thermodynamically consistent after perturbing parameters. To address this issue, we analyse the sensitivity of biological reaction networks in the context of a bond graph representation. We find that the parameter sensitivities can themselves be represented as bond graph components, mirroring potential mechanisms for controlling biochemistry. In particular a sensitivity system is derived which re-expresses parameter variation as additional system inputs. The sensitivity system is then linearised with respect to these new inputs to derive a linear system which can be used to give local sensitivity to parameters in terms of linear system properties such as gain and time constant. This linear system can also be used to find so-called sloppy parameters in biological models. We verify our approach using a model of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway, confirming the reactions and metabolites most essential to maintaining the function of the pathway.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation to one environment can often generate phenotypic and genotypic changes which impact the future ability of an organism to thrive in other environmental conditions. In the context of host-microbe interactions, biofilm formation can increase survival rates in vivo upon exposure to stresses, like the hosts immune system or antibiotic therapy. However, how the generic process of adaptation impacts the ability to form biofilm and how it may change through time has seldomly been studied. To do so, we used a previous evolution experiment with three strains of the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex, in which we did not specifically select for biofilm formation. We observed that changes in the ability to form biofilm happened very fast at first and afterwards reverted to ancestral levels in many populations. Biofilm changes were associated to phenotypic changes in population yield and surface polysaccharide production. Genotypically, mutational targets in the tip adhesin of type III fimbriae (mrkD) or the fim switch of type I fimbriae were driven by nutrient availability during evolution, and their impact on biofilm formation was dependent on capsule production. Analyses of natural isolates revealed similar mutations in mrkD, suggesting that they also play an important role in adaptation outside the laboratory. Our work reveals that the latent evolution of biofilm formation, and its evolutionary dynamics, depend on nutrient availability, the genetic background and other intertwined phenotypic and genotypic changes. Ultimately, it suggests that small differences in the environment can alter an organisms fate in more complex niches like the host.",

    "abstract": "Metabolomics studies in sickle cell disease (SCD) have been so far limited to tens of samples, owing to technical and experimental limitations. To overcome these limitations, we performed plasma metabolomics analyses on 596 samples from patients with sickle cell sickle cell disease (SCD) enrolled in the WALK-PHaSST study. Clinical covariates informed the biological interpretation of metabolomics data, including genotypes (hemoglobin SS, hemoglobin SC), history of recent transfusion (HbA%), response to hydroxyurea treatment (HbF%). We investigated metabolic correlates to the degree of hemolysis, cardiorenal function, as determined by tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and overall hazard ratio (unadjusted or adjusted by age). Recent transfusion events or hydroxyurea treatment were associated with elevation in plasma free fatty acids and decreases in acyl-carnitines, urate, kynurenine, indoles, carboxylic acids, and glycine- or taurine-conjugated bile acids. High levels of these metabolites, along with low levels of plasma S1P and L-arginine were identified as top markers of hemolysis, cardiorenal function (TRV, eGFR), and overall hazard ratio. We thus uploaded all omics and clinical data on a novel online portal that we used to identify a potential mechanism of dysregulated red cell S1P synthesis and export as a contributor to the more severe clinical manifestations in patients with the SS genotype compared to SC. In conclusion, plasma metabolic signatures - including low S1P, arginine and elevated kynurenine, acyl-carnitines and bile acids - are associated with clinical manifestation and therapeutic efficacy in SCD patients, suggesting new avenues for metabolic interventions in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "Insulin secretion from pancreatic {beta}-cells is integral in maintaining the delicate equilibrium of blood glucose levels. Calcium is known to be a key regulator and triggers the release of insulin. This sub-cellular process can be monitored and tracked through live-cell imaging and subsequent cell segmentation, registration, tracking, and analysis of the calcium level in each cell. Current methods of analysis typically require the manual outlining of {beta}-cells, involve multiple software packages, and necessitate multiple researchers - all of which tend to introduce biases. Utilizing deep learning algorithms, we have therefore created a pipeline to automatically segment and track thousands of cells, which greatly reduces the time required to gather and analyze a large number of sub-cellular images and improve accuracy. Tracking cells over a time-series image stack also allows researchers to isolate specific calcium spiking patterns and spatially identify those of interest, creating an efficient and user-friendly analysis tool. Using our automated pipeline, a previous dataset used to evaluate changes in calcium spiking activity in {beta}-cells post-electric field stimulation was reanalyzed. Changes in spiking activity were found to be underestimated previously with manual segmentation. Moreover, the machine learning pipeline provides a powerful and rapid computational approach to examine, for example, how calcium signaling is regulated by intracellular interactions in a cluster of {beta}-cells.",

    "abstract": "Liver homeostasis is ensured in part by time-of-day-dependent processes, many of them being paced by the molecular circadian clock. Liver functions are compromised in non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and clock disruption increases susceptibility to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression in rodent models. We therefore investigated whether time-of-day-dependent transcriptome and metabolome are significantly altered in human NAFL and NASH livers. Liver biopsies, collected within an 8 hour- window from a carefully phenotyped cohort of 290 patients and histologically diagnosed to be either normal, NAFL or NASH hepatic tissues, were analyzed by RNA sequencing and unbiased metabolomic approaches. Time-of-day-dependent gene expression patterns and metabolomes were identified and compared between histologically normal, NAFL and NASH livers. We provide here a first-of-its-kind report of a daytime-resolved human liver transcriptome-metabolome and associated alterations in NAFLD. Transcriptomic analysis showed a robustness of core molecular clock components in NAFL and NASH livers. It also revealed stage-specific, time-of-day- dependent alterations of hundreds of transcripts involved in cell-to-cell communication, intra- cellular signaling and metabolism. Similarly, rhythmic amino acid and lipid metabolomes were affected in pathological livers. Both TNFa and PPAR{gamma} signaling are predicted as important contributors to altered rhythmicity. NAFLD progression to NASH perturbs time-of-day-dependent processes in human livers, while core molecular clock component differential expression is maintained.",

    "abstract": "Adversity in childhood exerts enduring effects on brain and increases the vulnerability to psychiatric diseases. It also leads to a higher risk for eating disorders and obesity. We hypothesised that neonatal stress in mice affects motivation to obtain palatable food in adulthood and changes gene expression in reward system. Male and female pups from C57Bl/6J and C3H/HeN mice strains were subjected to a daily maternal separation (MS) protocol from PND2 to PND14. In adulthood, their motivation for palatable food reward was assessed in operant cages. Compared to control mice, male and female C3H/Hen mice exposed to MS significantly did more lever presses to obtain palatable food especially when the effort required to obtain the reward is high. Transcriptional analysis reveals 375 genes differentially expressed in the nucleus accumbens of male MS C3H/HeN mice compared to the control group, some of these being associated with the regulation of the reward system (e.g. Gnas, Pnoc). Interestingly, C57Bl/6J mice exposed to MS did not show any alteration in their motivation to obtain a palatable reward nor significant changes in gene expression in the nucleus accumbens. In conclusion, neonatal stress produces lasting changes in motivation for palatable food in C3H/HeN offspring but has no impact in C57Bl/6J offspring. These behavioural alterations are accompanied by drastic changes in gene expression specifically within the nucleus accumbens, a key structure in the regulation of motivational processes.",

    "abstract": "Several coronavirus (CoV) encoded proteins are being evaluated as targets for antiviral therapies for COVID-19. Included in this set of proteins is the conserved macrodomain, or Mac1, an ADP-ribosylhydrolase and ADP-ribose binding protein. Utilizing point mutant recombinant viruses, Mac1 was shown to be critical for both murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV virulence. However, as a potential drug target, it is imperative to understand how a complete Mac1 deletion impacts the replication and pathogenesis of different CoVs. To this end, we created recombinant bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) containing complete Mac1 deletions ({Delta}Mac1) in MHV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. While we were unable to recover infectious virus from MHV or MERS-CoV {Delta}Mac1 BACs, SARS-CoV-2 {Delta}Mac1 was readily recovered from BAC transfection, indicating a stark difference in the requirement for Mac1 between different CoVs. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 {Delta}Mac1 replicated at or near wild-type levels in multiple cell lines susceptible to infection. However, in a mouse model of severe infection, {Delta}Mac1 was quickly cleared causing minimal pathology without any morbidity. {Delta}Mac1 SARS-CoV-2 induced increased levels of interferon (IFN) and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression in cell culture and mice, indicating that Mac1 blocks IFN responses which may contribute to its attenuation. {Delta}Mac1 infection also led to a stark reduction in inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils. These results demonstrate that Mac1 only minimally impacts SARS-CoV-2 replication, unlike MHV and MERS-CoV, but is required for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and is a unique antiviral drug target.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEAll CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, encode for a conserved macrodomain (Mac1) that counters host ADP-ribosylation. Prior studies with SARS-CoV-1 and MHV found that Mac1 blocks IFN production and promotes CoV pathogenesis, which has prompted the development of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 inhibitors. However, development of these compounds into antivirals requires that we understand how SARS-CoV-2 lacking Mac1 replicates and causes disease in vitro and in vivo. Here we found that SARS-CoV-2 containing a complete Mac1 deletion replicates normally in cell culture but induces an elevated IFN response, has reduced viral loads in vivo, and does not cause significant disease in mice. These results will provide a roadmap for testing Mac1 inhibitors, help identify Mac1 functions, and open additional avenues for coronavirus therapies.",

    "abstract": "A strong correlation between NOS2 and COX2 tumor expression and poor clinical outcomes in ER-breast cancer has been established. However, mechanisms of tumor induction of these enzymes are unclear. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed correlations between NOS2 and COX2 expression and Th1 cytokines. Herein, single cell RNAseq analysis of TNBC cells shows potent NOS2 and COX2 induction by IFN{gamma} combined with IL1{beta} or TNF. Given that IFN{gamma} is secreted by cytolytic lymphocytes, which improve clinical outcomes, this role of IFN{gamma}presents a dichotomy. To explore this conundrum, tumor NOS2, COX2, and CD8+ T cells were spatially analyzed in aggressive ER-, TNBC, and HER2+ breast tumors. High expression and clustering of NOS2-expressing tumor cells occurred at the tumor/stroma interface in the presence of stroma-restricted CD8+ T cells. High expression and clustering of COX2-expressing tumor cells extended into immune desert regions in the tumor core where CD8+ T cell penetration was limited or absent. Moreover, high NOS2-expressing tumor cells were proximal to areas with increased satellitosis suggestive of cell clusters with a higher metastatic potential. Further in vitro experiments revealed that IFN{gamma}+IL1{beta}/TNF increased elongation and migration of treated tumor cells. This spatial analysis of the tumor microenvironment provides important insight of distinct neighborhoods where stroma-restricted CD8+ T cells exist proximal to NOS2-expressing tumor niches that could have increased metastatic potential.",

    "abstract": "The potential to capture the societal impact of research has been a driving motivation for the use and development of altmetrics. Yet, to date, altmetrics have largely failed to deliver on this potential because the primary audience who cites research on social media has been shown to be academics themselves. In response, our study investigates an extension of traditional altmetric approaches that goes beyond capturing direct mentions of research on social media. Using research articles from the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study, we demonstrate the value of measuring  second-order citations, or social media mentions of news coverage of research. We find that a sample of these citations, published by just five media outlets, were shared and engaged with on social media twice as much as the research articles themselves. Moreover, first-order and second-order citations circulated among Twitter accounts and Facebook accounts that were largely distinct from each other. The differences in audiences and engagement patterns found in this case study highlight the importance of news coverage as a public source of science information and provide strong evidence that investigating these second-order citations can be an effective way of observing non-academic audiences that engage with research content.",

    "abstract": "Viruses have been evolving host-modifying factors for billions of years. Genomes of bacterial and archaeal viruses are replete with fast-evolving, uncharacterized accessory genes (AGs), most of which likely antagonize host defenses or other viruses1, 2. Systematic investigation of AGs could uncover a multitude of biological mechanisms involved in virus-host competition, but AG identification in genomic databases remains a challenge. We developed an integrated computational and high-throughput discovery platform to identify AGs in virus genomes and assay their functions in complementary phage infection-dependent and -independent contexts. Our approach showcases how phages interact with the principal layers of antiviral immunity, including cell surface modifications, restriction systems, and abortive infection (Abi) mechanisms, which operate simultaneously in the same host. We discovered multiple Enterobacteriophage AGs associated with counter-defense functions that activate rather than inhibit antiviral immunity in cells, including the surprising finding that anti-restriction AGs elicit programmed cell death (PCD) activity of some restriction-modification (R-M) systems. We propose that counter-defense AGs that trigger PCD create a conundrum for phages whereby keeping the AGs causes PCD but losing them exposes the phage to restriction by bacteria. Strategies employed by viruses to avoid this double jeopardy could be an important factor in virus evolution that remains to be explored.",

Importantly, conditions at the mine site appear to favor microbial taxa that can tolerate perturbated environments, including taxa that can oxidize sulfur and participate in biofilm formation.\nC_LIO_LIOverall, our results highlight that moss section, moss species identity, and land-use type are strong drivers of diversity and community structure of moss-associated microbial taxa and metabolic genes.

    "abstract": "Summary paragraphThe host-microbiota relationship has evolved to shape mammalian processes, including immunity, metabolism, and development1-3. Host phenotypes change in direct response to microbial exposures by the individual. Here we show that the microbiota induces phenotypic change not only in the individual but also in their succeeding generations of progeny. We found that germ-free mice exhibit a robust sebum secretion defect and transcriptional changes in various organs, persisting across multiple generations despite microbial colonization and breeding with conventional mice. Host-microbe interactions could be involved in this process, since T cell-deficient mice, which display defective sebum secretion4, also transgenerationally transmit their phenotype to progeny. These phenotypes are inherited by progeny conceived during in vitro fertilization using germ-free sperm and eggs, demonstrating that epigenetic information in the gametes is required for phenotypic transmission. Accordingly, small non-coding RNAs that can regulate embryonic gene expression5 were strikingly and similarly altered in gametes of germ-free and T cell-deficient mice. Thus, we have uncovered a novel mechanism whereby the microbiota and immune system induce phenotypic changes in successive generations of offspring. This epigenetic form of inheritance could be advantageous for host adaptation to environmental perturbation, where phenotypic diversity can be introduced more rapidly than by genetic mutation.",

    "abstract": "At the end of March 2023, XBB.1.16, a SARS-CoV-2 omicron XBB subvariant, emerged and was detected in various countries. Compared to XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 has two substitutions in the S protein: E180V is in the N-terminal domain, and T478R in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). We first show that XBB.1.16 had an effective reproductive number (Re) that was 1.27- and 1.17-fold higher than the parental XBB.1 and XBB.1.5, respectively, suggesting that XBB.1.16 will spread worldwide in the near future. In fact, the WHO classified XBB.1.16 as a variant under monitoring on March 30, 2023. Neutralization assays demonstrated the robust resistance of XBB.1.16 to breakthrough infection sera of BA.2 (18-fold versus B.1.1) and BA.5 (37-fold versus B.1.1). We then used six clinically-available monoclonal antibodies and showed that only sotrovimab exhibits antiviral activity against XBB subvariants, including XBB.1.16. Our results suggest that, similar to XBB.1 and XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 is robustly resistant to a variety of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Our multiscale investigations suggest that XBB.1.16 that XBB.1.16 has a greater growth advantage in the human population compared to XBB.1 and XBB.1.5, while the ability of XBB.1.16 to exhibit profound immune evasion is comparable to XBB.1 and XBB.1.5. The increased fitness of XBB.1.16 may be due to (1) different antigenicity than XBB.1.5; and/or (2) the mutations in the non-S viral protein(s) that may contribute to increased viral growth efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Histone acetylation is a dynamic modification regulated by the opposing actions of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Deacetylation of histone tails results in chromatin tightening and therefore HDACs are generally regarded as transcriptional repressors. Counterintuitively, simultaneous deletion of Hdac1 and Hdac2 in embryonic stem cells (ESC) reduced expression of pluripotent transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog (OSN). By shaping global histone acetylation patterns, HDACs indirectly regulate the activity of acetyl-lysine readers, such as the transcriptional activator, BRD4. We used inhibitors of HDACs and BRD4 (LBH589 and JQ1 respectively) in combination with precision nuclear run-on and sequencing (PRO-seq) to examine their roles in defining the ESC transcriptome. Both LBH589 and JQ1 caused a marked reduction in the pluripotent network. However, while JQ1 treatment induced widespread transcriptional pausing, HDAC inhibition caused a reduction in both paused and elongating polymerase, suggesting an overall reduction in polymerase recruitment. Using enhancer RNA (eRNA) expression to measure enhancer activity we found that LBH589-sensitive eRNAs were preferentially associated with super-enhancers and OSN binding sites. These findings suggest that HDAC activity is required to maintain pluripotency by regulating the OSN enhancer network via the recruitment of RNA polymerase II.",

In this study, we experimentally determined e-liquid cardiotoxicity in both healthy cells and cells with long QT syndrome by treating healthy and diseased human cardiomyocytes with e-liquids with varying nicotine concentrations. These cardiomyocytes were generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells. The cardiomyocytes were divided into 5 groups, a control group and 4 test groups, each treated with e-liquid containing varying amounts of nicotine between 0% and 70%. The cells biological indicators such as heart rate, pulse pressure, essential protein concentration, and metabolic activity, were measured and characterized using three different functional assays: contractility, Western blot, and viability, and tracked over 4 days. The results demonstrated that acute exposure to e-liquid led to tachycardia, hypertension, decreased protein levels, and cell death. The rate of cardiotoxicity increases with higher nicotine concentrations. The basal fluid also showed non-negligible toxicity. Under identical conditions, the functionality of the diseased heart cells declined at a faster rate compared to healthy cells. Overall, this work establishes the harmful physiological effects of e-cigarettes on the human heart quantitatively.",

    "abstract": "Intestinal epithelial transit amplifying cells are essential stem progenitors required for intestinal homeostasis, but their rapid proliferation renders them vulnerable to DNA damage from radiation and chemotherapy. Despite their critical roles in intestinal homeostasis and disease, few studies have described genes that are essential to transit amplifying cell function. We report that the RNA methyltransferase, METTL3, is required for survival of transit amplifying cells in the murine small intestine. Transit amplifying cell death after METTL3 deletion was associated with crypt and villus atrophy, loss of absorptive enterocytes, and uniform wasting and death in METTL3-depleted mice. Ribosome profiling and sequencing of methylated RNAs in enteroids and in vivo demonstrated decreased translation of hundreds of unique methylated transcripts after METTL3 deletion, particularly transcripts involved in growth factor signal transduction such as Kras. Further investigation confirmed a novel relationship between METTL3 and Kras methylation and protein levels in vivo. Our study identifies METTL3 as an essential factor supporting the homeostasis of small intestinal tissue via direct maintenance of transit amplifying cell survival. We highlight the crucial role of RNA modifications in regulating growth factor signaling in the intestine, with important implications for both homeostatic tissue renewal and epithelial regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Complex chromosomal rearrangements (CCRs) are often observed in clinical samples from patients with cancer and congenital diseases but are difficult to induce experimentally. For generating animal models, these CCRs must be induced as desired, otherwise they cause profound genome instability and/or result in cell death. Here, we report the first success in establishing animal models for CCRs. The disruption of Recql5, which degrades RAD51 during DNA repair, successfully induces CRISPR/Cas9-mediated CCRs, establishing a mouse model containing triple fusion genes and megabase-sized inversions. Notably, some of these structural features of individual chromosomal rearrangements use template switching and microhomology-mediated break-induced replication mechanisms and are reminiscent of the newly described phenomenon \"chromoanasynthesis.\" Whole-genome sequencing analysis revealed that the structural variants in these mice caused only target-specific rearrangements. Thus, these data show that Recql5-deficient mice would be a novel powerful tool for analyzing the pathogenesis of CCRs, particularly chromoanasynthesis, whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.",

    "abstract": "Coordination of gene regulatory networks is necessary for proper execution of cellular programs throughout development. In C. elegans, spermatogenesis and oogenesis occur during different life stages (L4 and adult, respectively) within the hermaphroditic germline tissue. Yet, it remains unclear how these developmental programs are robustly executed, particularly during stressful conditions. Here we show evolutionarily conserved RNA interference (RNAi) pathways act to restrict expression of spermatogenesis genes to the L4 stage. Our findings indicate a novel RNAi-mediated regulatory cascade is essential for properly coordinating the spermatogenesis developmental program, particularly during heat stress. This is achieved through RNAi-mediated genetic switches that regulate the expression of the Argonautes, ALG-3 and ALG-4, to control ALG-3/4 pathway function. Moreover, this work provides key insights into the different molecular mechanisms RNAi pathways employ to maintain both maternal and paternal germ cells reproductive potential, and further highlights the complexities and importance of RNAi-mediated gene regulation in development.",

A KM-like value that is greater than the putative Kd value, 2.482 g/L, is equal to 2.569 g/L. The KM-like values in other situations are 2.396 and 2.407 g/L; the corresponding equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) values are, respectively, 2.288 and 2.299 g/L; the molar mass of insoluble potato starch ranges between 62.296 and 65.616 exp.

    "abstract": "Friedreichs ataxia (FA) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by mutation in FXN gene encoding for the mitochondrial protein frataxin (FXN). Patients with FA display an increased risk of developing diabetes that may aggravate disease prognosis. Recent studies have indicated that in addition to increased visceral adiposity, FA patients undergo a low-grade inflammatory state. The expansion of white adipose tissue (WAT) plays a fundamental role in the development of type 2 diabetes as it becomes insulin-resistant and a source of inflammatory molecules (adipokines). In this work, we have characterized visceral WAT (vWAT) at metabolic and immunological level in a murine FA model (KIKO) to test whether dysfunction of vWAT could be involved in FA metabolic complications. Through RNAseq analyses we found an alteration of inflammatory, angiogenesis and fibrosis genes in vWAT of KIKO mice. We also found other diabetes-related hallmarks such as increased lipid droplet size, immune cell infiltration and increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, by targeted metabolomics we disclosed a raise in lactate production, an event usually associated with obesity and diabetes and that triggers activation of vWAT resident macrophages. To reproduce an in vitro model of FA, we downregulated FXN protein in cultured white adipocytes and recapitulated the diabetes-like features observed in vWAT. Real time monitoring of adipocyte metabolism evidenced metabolic rewiring towards glycolysis according to increased lactate production. Analysis of fecal samples revealed a reduction of some butyrate-producing bacteria in KIKO mice. As this microbiota derived short-chain fatty was demonstrated to exert anti-diabetic function, we fed KIKO mice with a butyrate-enriched diet for 16 weeks. This dietary approach limited vWAT alterations and mitigated other diabetes-like signatures both in in vitro and in vivo models.\n\nIn conclusion, this study identified vWAT as an important player in the onset of metabolic complications typical of FA and suggests butyrate as safe and promising adjuvant tool to treat metabolic complications in FA.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that nascent versus aged condensates formed by prion-like low complexity domains (PLCDs) are distinct types of viscoelastic materials. Nascent PLCD condensates are terminally viscous Maxwell fluids whose viscoelastic moduli are governed by the strengths of aromatic stickers. Upon physical aging, PLCD condensates transition, on sequence-specific timescales, from fluids to non-fibrillar, elastic Kelvin-Voigt solids. Accordingly, fluid-like condensates of PLCDs are metastable, whereas elastic solids are the stable material states. Fluid-to-solid transitions are accelerated by mutations to spacers that weaken metastable fluids with respect to stable solids. Evolutionarily selected PLCD sequence features that enhance the metastabilities of fluid-like condensates are likely to render the barriers for conversion from fluids to solids to be insurmountable on timescales that are relevant to cellular processes.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology is an indispensable and powerful tool in the field of cancer biology. To conduct successful CRISPR-based experiments, it is crucial that sgRNAs generate their designed alterations. Here, we describe a simple and efficient sgRNA screening method for validating sgRNAs that generate oncogenic gene rearrangements. We used IL3-independence in Ba/F3 cells as an assay to identify sgRNA pairs that generate fusion oncogenes involving the Ret and Ntrk1 tyrosine kinases. We confirmed these rearrangements with PCR or RT-PCR as well as sequencing. Ba/F3 cells harboring Ret or Ntrk1 rearrangements acquired sensitivity to RET and TRK inhibitors, respectively. Adenoviruses encoding Cas9 and sgRNAs that catalyze the Kif5b-Ret and Trim24-Ret rearrangements were intratracheally instilled into mice and yielded lung adenocarcinomas. A cell line (TR.1) was established from a Trim24-Ret positive tumor that exhibited high in vitro sensitivity to RET-specific TKIs. Moreover, orthotopic transplantation of TR.1 cells into the left lung yielded well-defined tumors that shrank in response to LOXO-292 treatment. The method offers an efficient means to validate sgRNAs that successfully target their intended loci for the generation of novel murine oncogene-driven tumor models.",

    "abstract": "Achromobacter species are newly recognized opportunistic, pro-inflammatory Gram-negative pathogens in immunocompromised individuals, but how they interact with the innate immune system to drive inflammation is poorly understood. We created sctV (Type 3 Secretion System baseplate) mutants in three Achromobacter clinical isolates from two species and showed that all three required the T3SS to induce cell death in human macrophages. Mutating other critical T3SS components also abolished cell death, which was restored by genetic complementation. Cell death of Achromobacter-infected macrophages was contact-dependent, enhanced by bacterial internalisation, and caused by inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis (typified by Gasdermin-D cleavage and IL-1{beta} secretion). Macrophages deficient in the inflammasome sensors NLRC4 or NLRP3 underwent pyroptosis upon bacterial internalization but those deficient in both NLRC4 and NLRP3 did not, suggesting either sensor can mediate pyroptosis induction in a T3SS-dependent manner. Detailed analysis of the intracellular trafficking of one isolate indicated that the intracellular bacteria reside in an acidic LAMP-1/dextran-positive membrane compartment. Using an intranasal mouse infection model, we observed that Achromobacter damages lung structure and causes severe illness, contingent on a functional T3SS. Together, we demonstrate that Achromobacter species can survive phagocytosis by macrophages and promote macrophage cell death and inflammation by redundant mechanisms of pyroptosis induction.",
