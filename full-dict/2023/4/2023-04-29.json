    "abstract": "In Gram-negative bacteria, several trans-envelope complexes (TECs) have been identified that span the periplasmic space in order to facilitate lipid transport between the inner- and outer- membranes. While partial or near-complete structures of some of these TECs have been solved by conventional experimental techniques, most remain incomplete. Here we describe how a combination of computational approaches, constrained by experimental data, can be used to build complete atomic models for four TECs implicated in lipid transport in Escherichia coli. We use DeepMinds protein structure prediction algorithm, AlphaFold2, and a variant of it designed to predict protein complexes, AF2Complex, to predict the oligomeric states of key components of TECs and their likely interfaces with other components. After obtaining initial models of the complete TECs by superimposing predicted structures of subcomplexes, we use the membrane orientation prediction algorithm OPM to predict the likely orientations of the inner- and outer- membrane components in each TEC. Since, in all cases, the predicted membrane orientations in these initial models are tilted relative to each other, we devise a novel molecular mechanics-based strategy that we call \"membrane morphing\" that adjusts each TEC model until the two membranes are properly aligned with each other and separated by a distance consistent with estimates of the periplasmic width in E. coli. The study highlights the potential power of combining computational methods, operating within limits set by both experimental data and by cell physiology, for producing useable atomic structures of very large protein complexes.",

    "abstract": "The -opioid receptor (OR) is an important target for pain management and the molecular understanding of drug action will facilitate the development of better therapeutics. Here we show, using double electron-electron resonance (DEER) and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET), how ligand-specific conformational changes of the OR translate into a broad range of intrinsic efficacies at the transducer level. We identify several cytoplasmic receptor conformations interconverting on different timescales, including a pre-activated receptor conformation which is capable of G protein binding, and a fully activated conformation which dramatically lowers GDP affinity within the ternary complex. Interaction of {beta}-arrestin-1 with the OR core binding site appears less specific and occurs with much lower affinity than binding of G protein Gi.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryLigand-dependent conformational dynamics of the -opioid receptor determine downstream signaling efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Morphological profiling is a powerful technology that enables unbiased characterization of cellular states through image-based screening. Inspired by recent progress in self-supervised learning (SSL), we sought to explore the potential benefits of using SSL in this domain and conducted a comprehensive benchmark study of recent SSL methods for learning representations from Cell Painting images without segmentation. We trained DINO, MAE, and SimCLR on subsets of the JUMP-CP consortium data, one of the largest publicly available Cell Painting image sets, and observed improved model performance with larger and more heterogeneous training sets. Our best model (DINO) surpassed the widely used profiling tool CellProfiler by 29% in mean average precision (mAP) on classifying chemical perturbations and significantly accelerated feature extraction by 50x, at a lower cost. Moreover, DINO outperformed CellProfiler in clustering gene families on an independent gene overexpression dataset. Our findings indicate that SSL methods can improve the efficiency and performance of morphological profiling, offering the potential to expedite drug discovery and reduce compute costs.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the epigenetic regulator and global transcriptional activator, E1A binding protein (EP300), is being increasingly reported in aggressive hematological malignancies including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). However, the mechanistic contribution of EP300 dysregulation to cancer initiation and progression are currently unknown. Independent inhibition of EP300 in human cells results in the differential expression of genes involved in regulating the cell cycle, DNA replication and DNA damage response. Nevertheless, specific function played by EP300 in DNA replication initiation, progression and replication fork integrity has not been studied. Here, using ATLL cells as a model to study EP300 deficiency and an p300-selective PROTAC degrader, degrader as a pharmacologic tool, we reveal that EP300-mutated cells display prolonged cell cycle kinetics, due to pronounced dysregulations in DNA replication dynamics leading to persistent genomic instability. Aberrant DNA replication in EP300-mutated cells is characterized by elevated replication origin firing due to increased replisome pausing genome-wide. We demonstrate that EP300 deficiency results in nucleolytic degradation of nascently synthesized DNA at stalled forks due to a prominent defect in fork stabilization and protection. This in turn results in the accumulation of single stranded DNA gaps at collapsed replication forks, in EP300-deficient cells. Inhibition of Mre11 nuclease rescues the ssDNA accumulation indicating a dysregulation in downstream mechanisms that restrain nuclease activity at stalled forks. Importantly, we find that the absence of EP300 results in decreased expression of BRCA2 protein expression and a dependency on POLD3-mediated error-prone replication restart mechanisms. The overall S-phase abnormalities observed lead to under-replicated DNA in G2/M that instigates mitotic DNA synthesis. This in turn is associated with mitotic segregation defects characterized by elevated micronuclei formation, accumulation of cytosolic DNA and transmission of unrepaired inherited DNA lesions in the subsequent G1-phase in EP300-deficient cells. We demonstrate that the DNA replication dynamics of EP300-mutated cells ATLL cells recapitulate features of BRCA-deficient cancers. Altogether these results suggest that mutations in EP300 cause chronic DNA replication stress and defective replication fork restart results in persistent genomic instability that underlie aggressive chemo-resistant tumorigenesis in humans.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in adults. Cellular plasticity and the poorly differentiated features result in a fast relapse of the tumors following treatment. Moreover, the immunosuppressive microenvironment proved to be a major obstacle to immunotherapeutic approaches. Branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1 (BCAT1) is a metabolic enzyme that converts branched-chain amino acids into branched-chain keto acids, depleting cellular -ketoglutarate and producing glutamate. BCAT1 is expressed in and drives the growth of glioblastoma and other cancers. Here we show that low-BCAT1 expression correlates with differentiated glioblastoma subtypes and its knockout (KO) results in a differentiated phenotype in human and mouse glioblastoma cells. Consistent with these observations, Bcat1-KO mouse glioblastoma cells were highly susceptible to serum-induced differentiation in vitro. The transition to a differentiated cell state was linked to the increased activity of TET demethylases and the hypomethylation and activation of neuronal differentiation genes. Orthotopic tumor injection into immunocompetent mice demonstrated that the brain microenvironment is sufficient to induce differentiation of Bcat1-KO tumors in vivo. In addition, the knockout of Bcat1 attenuated immunosuppression, allowing for an extensive infiltration of CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells and complete abrogation of tumor growth. Additional analysis in immunodeficient hosts revealed that both Bcat1-KO-induced differentiation and immunomodulation contribute to the long-term suppression of tumor growth. In summary, our study demonstrates that BCAT1 promotes glioblastoma growth by blocking tumor cell differentiation and sustaining an immunosuppressive microenvironment. These findings suggest novel modes limiting glioblastoma phenotypic plasticity and therapeutic failure through targeting BCAT1.\n\nImportance of the studyHigh expression of BCAT1 occurs in many tumor entities and is related to aggressiveness, proliferation and invasion of tumor cells. In this study, we show that its expression is crucial for the continuous growth of glioblastoma cells by preventing their differentiation. Furthermore, we show that the expression of BCAT1 modulates the tumor immune microenvironment, suppressing the CD8 T-cell response. BCAT1 knockout causes glioblastoma cell differentiation and a persistent CD8 T-cell response, which is sufficient to abrogate tumor growth and prolong survival in in vivo immunocompetent and immunodeficient models, respectively. Our findings consolidate BCAT1 as a major player in glioblastoma and highlight its importance as a potential future target of research in this and other tumor entities.\n\nKey PointsO_LIBCAT1 expression maintains poorly differentiated features of glioblastoma cells and provides resistance to differentiation.\nC_LIO_LIExpression of BCAT1 in glioblastoma cells contributes to the immunosuppressive features of the tumor.\nC_LI",

Despite extensive research, current strategies to lower A{beta} levels have shown limited efficacy in slowing the cognitive decline associated with AD. Recent findings suggest that C99 may also play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD.\n\nOur laboratory has discovered that CK1{gamma}2 phosphorylates Presenilin 1 at the {gamma}-secretase complex, leading to decreased C99 and A{beta} levels. Thus, CK1{gamma}2 activation appears as a promising therapeutic target to lower both C99 and A{beta} levels.\n\nIn this study, we demonstrate that CK1{gamma}2 is inhibited by intramolecular autophosphorylation and describe a high-throughput screen designed to identify inhibitors of CK1{gamma}2 autophosphorylation. We hypothesize that these inhibitors could lead to CK1{gamma}2 activation and increased PS1-Ser367 phosphorylation, ultimately reducing C99 and A{beta} levels.\n\nUsing cultured cells, we investigated the impact of these compounds on C99 and A{beta} concentrations and confirmed that CK1{gamma}2 activation effectively reduces their levels. Our results provide proof of concept that CK1{gamma}2 is an attractive therapeutic target for AD.\n\nFuture studies should focus on the identification of specific compounds that can inhibit CK1{gamma}2 autophosphorylation and evaluate their efficacy in preclinical models of AD. These studies will pave the way for the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of AD.",

However, its impact on the innate immune responses of Japanese Black cattle, which are beef cattle endemic to Japan, remains unknown. Thus, in this study, we investigated the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on the immune responses of PBMC from Japanese Black cattle. PBMC were cultured with or without 1,25(OH)2D3 for measurement of cell viability, and stimulated with or without 1,25(OH)2D3 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for measurement of the gene expressions. As the results, the treatment of 1,25(OH)2D3 increased the cell viability. It also upregulated antibacterial peptides, DEFB10 and LAP with or without LPS stimulation. Moreover, 1,25(OH)2D3 enhanced the inflammatory responses, CXCL8 with LPS stimulation and NOS2 with or without LPS stimulation, while reducing the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 with or without LPS stimulation, leading to an inflammatory phenotype. However, in contrast to humans and mice, 1,25(OH)2D3 did not alter the expression of TNF and downregulated TREM1 with LPS treatment.

However, astroglial factors driving these physical and functional associations during postnatal brain development have yet to be identified. We characterized structural and transcriptional changes in mouse cortical astrocytes and microvessels during the first two postnatal weeks and found that high-mobility group box 1 (Hmgb1), normally upregulated with injury and involved in adult cerebrovascular repair, was highly expressed in astrocytes at birth and then decreased rapidly. Astrocyte-selective ablation of Hmgb1 at birth affected astrocyte morphology and endfoot placement, altered distribution of endfoot proteins connexin43 and aquaporin-4, induced transcriptional changes in astrocytes related to cytoskeleton remodeling, and profoundly disrupted endothelial ultrastructure. While lack of astroglial Hmgb1 did not affect the blood-brain barrier or angiogenesis postnatally, it impaired neurovascular coupling and behavior in adult mice. These findings identify astroglial Hmgb1 as a key player in postnatal gliovascular maturation.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is altering environmental conditions which is affecting species habitats globally. As a result, many species are shifting their habitat ranges poleward to ensure that they remain within their optimal thermal range. On average, marine species have shifted their ranges poleward by approximately 72km to track their optimal thermal conditions compared to 17km for terrestrial species. These range shifts are pushing some species out of their currently fished areas. This will require nations and fishery companies to predict the most likely areas their target species could move to and obtain permits to fish in those new areas. Spiny lobsters (genus Jasus) are likely to shift their ranges poleward as they are distributed within a relatively tight latitudinal band, but there is limited information about the extent of any potential range shifts. The aims of this study were to identify the environmental variables that characterise the current habitat locations of lobsters within the genus Jasus, and to predict their potential distribution by modelling future suitable habitat under the RCP45, RCP60, and RCP85 climate scenarios using MaxEnt. There were 16 environmental variables used for modelling suitable habitat for the present (2000-2014), while only four environmental variables were available for modelling in two future time periods (2040-2050 and 2090-2100). There was a predicted overall southern shift in suitable habitat locations for all species. The most important environmental variable identified for species distributed along continental shelves (J. edwardsii and J. lalandii) was benthic temperature. Benthic nutrients (silicate, nitrate, and phosphate) were the most important variables for species distributed around islands and on seamounts (J. paulensis, J. frontalis, and J. tristani). Approximately 90% of Jasus lobsters present range contained highly suitable habitat locations. The percent of highly suitable locations under the RCP45 and RCP60 scenarios were higher than the present percentages for each species, while under the RCP85 scenario, there was a decrease of highly suitable habitat for most species in 2040-2050 period, while for the 2090- 2100 period, there was an increase in the percent of highly suitable habitats. This study provides evidence that Jasus populations might become more abundant in the southern extents of their current range as they track their optimum habitat conditions.",

    "abstract": "1Mechanistic models are particularly useful for understanding and predicting population dynamics in data deficient species. Data deficiency is a relevant issue in small scale fisheries as they are generally under studied and underrepresented in global fishing datasets. As overfishing remains a global issue, especially in small-scale fisheries, one commonly utilized conservation method is temporary closures. The blue octopus (Octopus cyanea) fishery off the southwest coast of Madagascar is one such system that uses temporary closures, yet lacks sufficient data collection to assess the viability of the population. This fishery is a key economic resource for the local community as blue octopus catch is sold by local fishers to international and local export markets and is a major component of fisher income. To assess the sustainability of blue octopus, we parameterize a Levkovitch population matrix model using existing catch data. In this study, we show that this population was in a decline of 1.8% per month at the time of data collection. To sustain the existing population of blue octopus, our model indicates that the fishery would need to close for at least three months annually. Increasing the length of closure is predicted to significantly increase the octopus population at these sites. We show that if implemented correctly, temporary closures could be used to restore this population. The local communities of Madagascar have implemented various fishing restrictions to ensure sustainable fishing, indicating a need for further research into the effectiveness of these fishing closures. Therefore, our study provides insight into the underlying population dynamics of this fishery and provides survivability estimates of this species.",

Here, we report on a nine-year population-genomic survey of the microcrustacean Daphnia pulex. The genome-sequences of > 800 isolates provide insights into patterns of selection that cannot be obtained from long-term molecular-evolution studies, including the pervasiveness of near quasi-neutrality across the genome (mean net selection coefficients near zero, but with significant temporal variance about the mean, and little evidence of positive covariance of selection across time intervals), the preponderance of weak negative selection operating on minor alleles, and a genome-wide distribution of numerous small linkage islands of observable selection influencing levels of nucleotide diversity. These results suggest that fluctuating selection is a major determinant of standing levels of variation in natural populations, challenge the conventional paradigm for interpreting patterns of nucleotide diversity and divergence, and motivate the need for the development of new theoretical expressions for the interpretation of population-genomic data.\n\nSignificanceExcept for mono/oligogenic traits known in advance to be under strong selection, there is little information on genome-wide patterns of temporal dynamics of allele-frequency changes in well-defined and unmanipulated natural populations. A multi-year survey of a population of the microcrustacean Daphnia pulex provides insight into these matters. Genome-wide analysis of > 800 genetic isolates demonstrates that temporal variation in selection intensity is a major determinant of levels of nucleotide polymorphism and divergence. Most nucleotide sites experience fluctuating selection with mean selection coefficients near zero, with little covariance in the strength of selection across time intervals, and with selection distributed across large numbers of genomic islands of linked sites. These results raise challenges for the conventional interpretation of measures of nucleotide diversity and divergence as indicators of effective population sizes and intensities of positive/negative selection.",

We investigate this fundamental question by characterizing the Perivitellin-1 (PV1) orthologs within Pomacea snails.

To gain insight into the molecular evolution of reproductive proteins along a genus we studied P. patula PV1 (PpaPV1) from Flagellata eggs, the most basal clade of Pomacea. PpaPV1 stands as the most stable PV1, with a much longer unfolding half-life and resistance to detergent unfolding, indicating a loss of kinetic stability in the derived clades. In fact, PpaPV1 is among the most hyperstable proteins described in nature. Its molecular weight, size, and high resistance to proteolysis are similar to and shared with all PV1s. Its spectral characteristics and associated pale egg coloration as well as a mild lectin activity indicate these protein traits appeared early in the evolution of the genus. However, lectin binding is less strong, and glycan specificity is narrower than those PV1s of its sister Bridgesii clade.\n\nOur results provide experimental evidence of the relationship between protein stability and evolvability, showing that along their rapid evolution, PV1s tradeoff between structural and kinetic stability loss and the acquisition of diverse defensive traits: a strong lectin activity (Bridgesii clade), or an aposematic warning coloration (Canaliculata clade). This study offers insight into the molecular evolution of a novel family of invertebrate reproductive proteins that accompanied the fast diversification of the genus and may have contributed to Canaliculata snails invasiveness.",

However, most variants have insufficient evidence of clinical consequences and thus limited clinical utility.\n\nResultsHere, we demonstrate the power of variant effect mapping, which couples saturation mutagenesis with high-throughput sequencing, to ascertain the function of thousands of protein coding KCNE1 variants. We comprehensively assayed KCNE1 variant cell surface expression (2,554/2,709 possible single amino acid variants) and function (2,539 variants). We identified 470 loss-of-surface expression and 588 loss-of-function variants. Out of the 588 loss-of-function variants, only 155 had low cell surface expression. The latter half of the protein is dispensable for protein trafficking but essential for channel function. 22 of the 30 KCNE1 residues (73%) highly intolerant of variation were in predicted close contact with binding partners KCNQ1 or calmodulin. Our data were highly concordant with gold standard electrophysiological data ({rho} = -0.65), population and patient cohorts (32/38 concordant variants), and computational metrics ({rho} = -0.55). Our data provide moderate-strength evidence for the ACMG/AMP functional criteria for benign and pathogenic variants.\n\nConclusionsComprehensive variant effect maps of KCNE1 can both provide insight into IKs channel biology and help reclassify variants of uncertain significance.",

    "abstract": "The inability of antibodies and other biologics to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a key limitation to their use in diagnostic, imaging, and therapeutic applications. One promising strategy is to deliver IgGs using a bispecific BBB shuttle, which involves fusing an IgG with a second affinity ligand that engages a cerebrovascular endothelial target and facilitates transport across the BBB. Nearly all prior efforts have focused on the transferrin receptor (TfR-1) as the prototypical endothelial target despite inherent delivery and safety challenges. Here we report bispecific antibody shuttles that engage CD98hc (also known as 4F2 and SLC3A2), the heavy chain of the large neutral amino acid transporter (LAT1), and efficiently transport IgGs into the brain parenchyma. Notably, CD98hc shuttles lead to much longer-lived brain retention of IgGs than TfR-1 shuttles while enabling more specific brain targeting due to limited CD98hc engagement in the brain parenchyma. We demonstrate the broad utility of the CD98hc shuttles by reformatting three existing IgGs as CD98hc bispecific shuttles and delivering them to the mouse brain parenchyma that either agonize a neuronal receptor (TrkB) or target other endogenous antigens on specific types of brain cells (neurons and astrocytes).",

    "abstract": "DDX5 (p68) upregulation has been linked with various cancers of different origins, especially Colon Adenocarcinomas. Similarly, across cancers, MGMT has been identified as the major contributor of chemoresistance against DNA alkylating agents like Temozolomide (TMZ). TMZ is an emerging potent chemotherapeutic agent across cancers under the arena of drug repurposing. Recent studies have established that patients with open MGMT promoters are prone to be innately resistant or acquire resistance against TMZ compared to its closed conformation. However, not much is known about the transcriptional regulation of MGMT gene in the context of colon cancer. This necessitates studying MGMT gene regulation, which directly impacts the cellular potential to develop chemoresistance against alkylating agents. Our study aims to uncover an unidentified mechanism of DDX5-mediated MGMT gene regulation. Experimentally, we found that both mRNA and protein expression levels of MGMT were elevated in response to p68 overexpression in multiple human colon cancer cell lines and vice-versa. Since p68 cannot directly interact with the MGMT promoter, transcription factors viz., {beta}-catenin, RelA (p65) and SP1 were also studied as reported contributors. Through co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pull-down studies, p68 was established as an interacting partner of SP1 in addition to {beta}-catenin and NF-{kappa}B (p50-p65). Mechanistically, luciferase reporter and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that p68 interacts with the MGMT promoter via TCF4-LEF, RELA and SP1 sites to enhance its transcription. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of p68 as a transcriptional co-activator of MGMT promoter and our study identifies p68 as a novel and master regulator of MGMT gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease that causes over 100,000 deaths annually. Envenomings result in variable pathologies, but systemic neurotoxicity is among the most serious and is currently only treated with difficult to access and variably efficacious commercial antivenoms. Venom-induced neurotoxicity is often caused by -neurotoxins antagonising the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a ligand-gated ion channel. Discovery of therapeutics targeting -neurotoxins is hampered by relying on binding assays that do not reveal restoration of receptor activity or more costly and/or lower throughput electrophysiology-based approaches. Here, we report the validation of a screening assay for nAChR activation using immortalised TE671 cells expressing the {gamma}-subunit containing muscle-type nAChR and a fluorescent dye that reports changes in cell membrane potential. Assay validation using traditional nAChR agonists and antagonists, which either activate or block ion fluxes, was consistent with previous studies. We then characterised antagonism of the nAChR by a variety of elapid snake venoms that cause muscle paralysis in snakebite victims, before defining the toxin-inhibiting activities of commercial antivenoms, and new types of snakebite therapeutic candidates, namely monoclonal antibodies, decoy receptors, and small molecules. Our findings show robust evidence of assay uniformity across 96-well plates and highlight the amenability of this approach for the future discovery of new snakebite therapeutics via screening campaigns. The described assay therefore represents a useful first-step approach for identifying -neurotoxins and their inhibitors in the context of snakebite envenoming, and it should provide wider value for studying modulators of nAChR activity from other sources.",

To address this technology gap, we developed a platform for pooled library screening in plant protoplasts for rapid identification of interacting R/Avr pairs. We validated this platform by isolating known and novel Avr genes from wheat stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) by screening a designed library of putative effectors against individual R genes. Rapid Avr gene identification provides molecular tools to understand and track pathogen virulence evolution by genotype surveillance and optimise R gene deployment and stacking strategies.

C. difficile infections (CDIs) are the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the U.S. 3, 4 and typically develop in individuals following disruption of the gut microbiota due to antibiotic or chemotherapy treatments 2. Further treatment of CDI with antibiotics is not always effective and can lead to antibiotic resistance and recurrent infections (rCDI) 5, 6. The most effective treatment for rCDI is the reestablishment of an intact microbiota via fecal microbiota transplants (FMTs) 7. However, the success of FMTs has been difficult to generalize because the microbial interactions that prevent engraftment and facilitate the successful clearance of C. difficile are still only partially understood 8. Here we show how microbial community-scale metabolic models (MCMMs) accurately predicted known instances of C. difficile colonization susceptibility or resistance. MCMMs provide detailed mechanistic insights into the ecological interactions that govern C. difficile engraftment, like cross-feeding or competition involving metabolites like succinate, trehalose, and ornithine, which differ from person to person. Indeed, three distinct C. difficile metabolic niches emerge from our MCMMs, two associated with positive growth rates and one that represents non-growth, which are consistently observed across 14,862 individuals from four independent cohorts. Finally, we show how MCMMs can predict personalized engraftment and C. difficile growth suppression for a probiotic cocktail (VE303) designed to replace FMTs for the treatment rCDI 9, 10. Overall, this powerful modeling approach predicts personalized C. difficile engraftment risk and can be leveraged to assess probiotic treatment efficacy. MCMMs could be extended to better understand personalized engraftment of other opportunistic bacterial pathogens, beneficial probiotic organisms, or more complex microbial consortia.",

Approaches towards modeling rarely studied organisms are scarce. We introduce a cost-effective and easy experimental protocol which can be adapted to other organisms as well. Furthermore, the comparability of growth kinetics and in silico growth rates is discussed. This work introduces five newly created strain-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) of high quality, satisfying all contemporary standards and requirements. All these models have been benchmarked using the community standard test suite Metabolic Model Testing (MEMOTE) and experimentally validated by laboratory experiments conducted specifically for this purpose. For the curation of those models, the software infrastructure refineGEMs was developed to work on these models in parallel and to comply with the quality standards for GEMs. The model predictions were confirmed by experimental data and a new comparison metric based on the doubling time was developed to quantify bacterial growth. Future modeling projects can rely on the proposed software, which is independent of specific environmental conditions. The validation approach based on the growth rate calculation is now accessible and closely aligned with biological questions.

The degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) superfamily, which occurs throughout the animal kingdom, is unique in its diversity of gating stimuli, with some DEG/ENaCs gated by conventional ligands such as neuropeptides, and others gated by e.g. pH, mechanical force, or enzymatic activity2-5. The mechanism by which ligands bind to and activate DEG/ENaCs is poorly understood. We have therefore dissected the structural basis for neuropeptide binding and gating in a neuropeptide-gated DEG/ENaC, FMRFamide-gated sodium channel 1 (FaNaC1) from the annelid worm Malacoceros fuliginosus6, using cryo-electron microscopy. High-resolution structures of FaNaC1 in the ligand-free resting state and in several ligand-bound states reveal the ligand-binding site and capture the ligand-induced conformational changes that mediate channel gating. Complementary mutagenesis experiments confirm the functional roles of particular amino acid residues implicated by the structures. Our results illuminate ligand-induced channel gating in DEG/ENaCs and offer a structural template for the experimental dissection of channel pharmacology and ion conduction in a characteristically metazoan ion channel superfamily.",

Chemogenetic activation of these neurons caused a bilateral and widespread reduction in heat, cold, and mechanical sensitivity, while their silencing with tetanus toxin induced allodynia and spontaneous pain-like aversive behaviors. Consistent with a continuous role in the prevention of spontaneous pain, many descending RVM GABAergic neurons were found to be tonically active.

    "abstract": "Most eukaryotic cells utilize clathrin-mediated endocytosis as well as multiple clathrin-independent pathways to internalize proteins and membranes. Although clathrin-mediated endocytosis has been studied extensively and many machinery proteins have been identified, clathrin-independent pathways remain poorly characterized by comparison. We previously identified the first known yeast clathrin-independent endocytic pathway, which relies on the actin-modulating GTPase Rho1, the formin Bni1 and unbranched actin filaments, but does not require the clathrin coat or core clathrin machinery proteins. In this study, we sought to better understand clathrin-independent endocytosis in yeast by exploring the role of myosins as actin-based motors, since actin is required for endocytosis in yeast. We find that Myo2, which transports secretory vesicles, organelles and microtubules along actin cables to sites of polarized growth, participates in clathrin-independent endocytosis. Unexpectedly, the ability of Myo2 to transport microtubule plus ends to the cell cortex appears to be required for its role in clathrin-independent endocytosis. In addition, dynein, dynactin and proteins involved in cortical microtubule capture are also required. Thus, our results suggest that interplay between actin and microtubules contributes to clathrin-independent internalization in yeast.\n\nSummary StatementClathrin-independent endocytosis is a poorly-understood but conserved process.

    "abstract": "BackgroundGastric cancer is a heterogeneous pathology that represents the fifth most frequent malignancy in the world, with more than 750,000 deaths by 2020. With significant repercussions in public health, this pathology lacks biomarkers for early diagnosis, with endoscopy biopsy being the golden test for its detection. In the exploration of new strategies to control gastric cancer in recent years, liquid biopsy appears as a potential source of biomarkers using non-invasive procedures.\n\nMethodsHere we present the characterization of miRNAs contained in plasma-derived exosomes from patients with gastric cancer. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and their characterization was performed by electron microscopy, protein expression, and nanoparticle analysis techniques. Total RNA from isolated exosomes was obtained for small RNA-seq analysis.\n\nResultsTranscriptomic miRNA data were used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs between patients with benign and malignant gastric diseases, which resulted in a molecular signature of nine miRNAs, that were used in a regression model to classify individuals as either having benign or malignant disease. Further, we compared benign-malignant patients at different stages of gastric cancer, and we detected 15 differentially expressed miRNAs. Among these 15 miRNAs, miR-92a-3p, miR451a, and miR126-3p were identified as winners due to their clinical and regulatory relevance.\n\nResultsOur results offer relevant information of a Colombian case study allowing us to propose three transcriptomic gastric cancer biomarkers in liquid biopsy.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=131 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/538562v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fca084org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18e41cborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@81ad97org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1abb9b1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG SummaryEVs are structures surrounded by a lipid bilayer that facilitate intercellular communication by transporting biomolecules commonly referred to as part of liquid biopsy.

    "abstract": "Mutations in the SCN1B gene have been linked to severe developmental epileptic encephalopathies including Dravet syndrome. Scn1b knockout (KO) mice model SCN1B loss of function disorders, demonstrating seizures, developmental delays, and early death.SCN1B encodes the protein {beta}1, an ion channel auxiliary subunit that also has roles in cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth, and gene expression. The goal of this project is to better understand of how loss of {beta}1 alters information processing in the brain, resulting in seizures and associated cognitive dysfunction. Using slice electrophysiology in the CA1 region of the hippocampus from male and female Scn1b KO mice and wild-type (WT) littermates, we found that processing of physiologically relevant patterned Schaffer collateral (SC) stimulation produces larger, prolonged depolarizations and increased spiking in KO neurons compared to WTs. KO neurons exhibit enhanced intrinsic excitability, firing more action potentials with current injection. Interestingly, SC stimulation produces smaller, more facilitating excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents in KO pyramidal neurons, but larger postsynaptic potentials with the same stimulation. We also found reduced intrinsic firing of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons and disrupted recruitment of both parvalbumin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons in response to patterned synaptic stimulation. Neuronal information processing relies on the interplay between synaptic properties, intrinsic properties that amplify or suppress incoming synaptic signals, and firing properties that produce cellular output. We found changes at each of these levels in Scn1b KO pyramidal neurons, resulting in fundamentally altered information processing in the hippocampus that likely contributes to the complex phenotypes of SCN1B-linked epileptic encephalopathies.\n\nSignificance statementGenetic developmental epileptic encephalopathies have limited treatment options, in part due to our lack of understanding of how genetic changes result in dysfunction at the cellular and circuit levels. SCN1B is a gene linked to Dravet syndrome and other epileptic encephalopathies, and Scn1b knockout mice phenocopy the human disease, allowing us to study underlying neurophysiological changes. Here we found changes at all levels of neuronal information processing in brains lacking {beta}1, including intrinsic excitability, synaptic properties, and synaptic integration, resulting in greatly enhanced input/output functions of the hippocampus. Our study shows that loss of {beta}1 results in a complex array of cellular and network changes that fundamentally alters information processing in the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "The homeostatic regulation of sleep is characterized by rebound sleep after prolonged wakefulness, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this regulation are still unknown. We show here that CaMKII-dependent activity control of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing cortical neurons is involved in sleep homeostasis regulation. Prolonged wakefulness enhances cortical PV-neuron activity. Chemogenetic suppression or activation of cortical PV neurons inhibits or induces rebound sleep, implying that rebound sleep is dependent on increased activity of cortical PV neurons. Furthermore, we discovered that CaMKII kinase activity boosts the activity of cortical PV neurons, and that kinase activity is important for homeostatic sleep rebound. We propose that CaMKII-dependent PV-neuron activity represents negative feedback inhibition of cortical neural excitability, which serves as the distributive cortical circuits for sleep homeostatic regulation.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes are in constant communication with neurons during the establishment and maturation of functional networks in the developing brain. Astrocytes release extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing microRNA (miRNA) cargo that regulates transcript stability in recipient cells. Astrocyte released factors are thought to be involved in neurodevelopmental disorders. Healthy astrocytes partially rescue Rett Syndrome (RTT) neuron function. EVs isolated from stem cell progeny also correct aspects of RTT. EVs cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and their cargo is found in peripheral blood which may allow non-invasive detection of EV cargo as biomarkers produced by healthy astrocytes. Here we characterize miRNA cargo and sequence motifs in healthy human astrocyte derived EVs (ADEVs). First, human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC) were differentiated into Neural Progenitor Cells (NPCs) and subsequently into astrocytes using a rapid differentiation protocol. iPSC derived astrocytes expressed specific markers, displayed intracellular calcium transients and secreted EVs. miRNAs were identified by RNA-Seq on astrocytes and ADEVs and target gene pathway analysis detected brain related terms. The miRNA profile was consistent with astrocyte identity, and included approximately 80 miRNAs found in astrocytes that were relatively depleted in ADEVs suggestive of passive loading. About 120 miRNAs were relatively enriched in ADEVs and motif analysis discovered binding sites for RNA binding proteins FUS, SRSF7 and CELF5. miRNA 483-5p was the most significantly enriched in ADEVs. This miRNA regulates MECP2 expression in neurons and has been found differentially expressed in blood samples from RTT patients. Our results identify potential miRNA biomarkers selectively sorted into ADEVs and implicate RNA binding protein sequence dependent mechanisms for miRNA cargo loading.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian aging leads to diminished fertility, dysregulated endocrine signaling, and increased chronic disease burden. These effects begin to emerge long before follicular exhaustion. Around 35 years old, women experience a sharp decline in fertility, corresponding to declines in oocyte quality. However, the field lacks a cellular map of the transcriptomic changes in the aging ovary to identify drivers of ovarian decline. To fill this gap, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on ovarian tissue from young (3-month-old) and reproductively aged (9-month-old) mice. Our analysis revealed a doubling of immune cells in the aged ovary, with T and B lymphocyte proportions increasing most. We also discovered an age-related upregulation of alternative macrophage and downregulation of collagenase pathways in stromal fibroblasts. Overall, follicular cells (especially granulosa and theca) display stress response, immunogenic, and fibrotic signaling pathway inductions with aging. These changes are more exaggerated in the atretic granulosa cells but are also observed in healthy antral and preantral granulosa cells. Moreover, we did not observe age-related changes in markers of cellular senescence in any cellular population with advancing age, despite specific immune cells expressing senescence-related genes across both timepoints. This report raises several new hypotheses that could be pursued to elucidate mechanisms responsible for ovarian aging phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) are crucial and dynamic players in a large variety of cellular processes and signaling, and proteomic technologies have emerged as the method of choice to profile PTMs. However, these analyses remain challenging due to potential low PTM stoichiometry, the presence of multiple PTMs per proteolytic peptide, PTM site localization of isobaric peptides, and labile PTM groups that lead to neutral losses. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) is commonly used for to characterize PTMs, but the application of collision energy can lead to neutral losses and incomplete peptide sequencing for labile PTM groups. In this study, we compared CID to an alternative fragmentation, electron activated dissociation (EAD), operated on a recently introduced fast-acquisition quadrupole-time-of-flight (QqTOF) mass spectrometer. We analyzed a series of synthetic modified peptides, featuring phosphorylated, succinylated, malonylated, and acetylated peptides. We performed targeted, quantitative parallel reaction monitoring (PRM or MRMHR) assays to assess the performances of EAD to characterize, site-localize and quantify peptides with labile modifications. The tunable EAD kinetic energy allowed the preservation of labile modifications and provided better peptide sequence coverage with strong PTM-site localization fragment ions. Zeno trap activation provided significant MS/MS sensitivity gains by an average of 6-11-fold for EAD analyses, regardless of modification type. Evaluation of the quantitative EAD PRM workflows revealed high reproducibility with coefficients of variation of typically [~]2%, as well as very good linearity and quantification accuracy. This novel workflow, combining EAD and Zeno trap, offers confident, accurate, and robust characterization and quantification of PTMs.",

Later, enrichment analysis of the differential proteins was performed mainly by Metascape and String, and disease association analysis of gene or variant genotype-phenotype with the help of DisGeNET and Monarch. We found that the biological pathways mainly related to metabolism were most abundant, and at the same time abnormal homeostasis, cancer and tumor, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases appeared. However, under the analysis of Monarch, homozygotes or heterozygotes contained abnormal homeostasis at all time points, and most of them ranked the first or at least the top, while all timepoints in the growth and development of each normal rat were not enriched to abnormal homeostasis and other disease pathways.",

    "abstract": "153-residue hSOD1 is first gene whose mutations were identified to cause FALS, while WT-hSOD1 aggregation is linked to SALS. So far >180 ALS-causing mutations have been identified but the underlying mechanism remains an enigma. Mature hSOD1 is stabilized by a disulfide bridge to adopt the Greek-key {beta}-barrel holding zinc and copper cofactors. In contrast, nascent hSOD1 is unfolded and prone to aggregation, which needs Zn2+ at 1:20 to initiate folding into a co-existence of folded and unfolded states. Recently the disruption of Zn2+-binding by mutations was correlated to the acquired ability to form toxic aggregates. Therefore, decoding factors to induce hSOD1 folding provides mechanistic insights and therapy development for hSOD1-associated ALS. Here, by NMR we visualized effects of 12 cations and surprisingly, most including three with Zn2+-like properties had no ability to bind or induce folding. Cu2+ extensively binds but triggers aggregation. Unexpectedly, Fe2+ could induce folding with a Zn2+-like binding pocket. Most unexpectedly, ATP converted nascent hSOD1 into a co-existence of two states at 1:8 with its capacity from triphosphate. By contrast, TMAO showed no detectable conversion even at 1:1000. Comparing conformations and dynamics of ATP- and Zn2+-induced states revealed that hSOD1 maturation requires intrinsic folding capacity encoded by the sequence as well as additional information specifically provided by Zn2+-coordination and disulfide formation. Therefore Zn2+ induces folding by specific coordination but ATP by generally enhancing the intrinsic capacity, as also observed on 140-residue C71G-hPFN1 composed of both -helices and {beta}- sheets without disulfide bridge. ATP- and Zn2+-induced states without disulfide bridge remain co-existing between two states which are separated by an energy barrier larger than that of C71G-hPFN1. This study unveils the irreplaceable role of Zn2+ in preventing ALS and provides hSOD1-dependent mechanisms for Cu2+/Fe2+ cytotoxicity. Strikingly, ATP appears to induce folding generally, thus rationalizing ageing-dependent onset even for FALS.",

Thus, the peptidoglycan layer is necessary but not sufficient to maintain turgor, which challenges the general view that protecting cells from bursting is the specific task of the peptidoglycan cell wall.\n\nONE-SENTENCE SUMMARYThe peptidoglycan and outer membrane are interconnected layers that cooperate to balance cytoplasmic turgor.",

Here, we engineer metabolically versatile host P. putida for isoprenol production. We employ two computational modeling approaches (Bilevel optimization and Constrained Minimal Cut Sets) to predict gene knockout targets and optimize the \"IPP-bypass\" pathway in P. putida to maximize isoprenol production. Altogether, the highest isoprenol production titer from P. putida was achieved at 3.5 g/L under fed-batch conditions.

    "abstract": "Bioengineers increasingly rely on ligand-inducible transcription regulators for chemical-responsive control of gene expression, yet the number of regulators available is limited. Novel regulators can be mined from genomes, but an inadequate understanding of their DNA specificity complicates genetic design. Here we present Snowprint, a simple yet powerful bioinformatic tool for predicting regulator:DNA interactions. Benchmarking results demonstrate that Snowprint predictions are significantly similar for >45% of experimentally validated regulator:operator pairs from organisms across nine phyla and for regulators that span five distinct structural families. We then use Snowprint to design promoters for 33 previously uncharacterized regulators sourced from diverse phylogenies, of which 28 were shown to influence gene expression and 24 produced a >20-fold signal-to-noise ratio. A panel of the newly domesticated regulators were then screened for response to biomanufacturing-relevant compounds, yielding new sensors for a polyketide (olivetolic acid), terpene (geraniol), steroid (ursodiol), and alkaloid (tetrahydropapaverine) with induction ranges up to 10.7-fold. Snowprint represents a unique, generalizable tool that greatly facilitates the discovery of ligand-inducible transcriptional regulators for bioengineering applications.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=119 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/538814v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14f4939org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5066e3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@92d7cforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@968163_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",
