    "abstract": "Renal hemodynamics, renal transporter expression levels, and urine excretion all exhibit circadian variations. Disturbance of these diurnal patterns is associated with hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Renal hemodynamics determines oxygen delivery, whereas renal transport and metabolism determines oxygen consumption. The balance between oxygen delivery and consumption then yields renal oxygenation. We hypothesized that kidney oxygenation also demonstrates 24-h periodicity. Another notable modulator of kidney function is sex, which has impacts on renal hemodynamics and transport function that are regulated by as well as independent of the circadian clock. The goal of this study was to investigate the diurnal and sexual variations in renal oxygen consumption and oxygenation. For this purpose, we developed computational models of rat kidney function that represent sexual dimorphism and circadian variation in renal hemodynamics and transporter activities. Model simulations predicted substantial differences in tubular Na+ transport and oxygen consumption among different nephron segments. We also simulated the effect of loop diuretics, which are used in the treatment of renal hypoxia, on the outer medullary oxygen tension. Our model predicted a significantly higher effect of loop diuretics on renal oxygenation in female rats compared to male rats. In addition, loop diuretics were more effective when administered during the active phase.",

    "abstract": "1.Microbial communities play a crucial role in ecosystem function through metabolic interactions. Genome-scale modeling is a promising method to understand these interactions. Flux balance analysis (FBA) is most often used to predict the flux through all reactions in a genome-scale model. However, the fluxes predicted by FBA depend on a user-defined cellular objective. Flux sampling is an alternative to FBA, as it provides the range of fluxes possible within a microbial community. Furthermore, flux sampling may capture additional heterogeneity across cells, especially when cells exhibit sub-maximal growth rates. In this study, we simulate the metabolism of microbial communities and compare the metabolic characteristics found with FBA and flux sampling. We find significant differences in the predicted metabolism with sampling, including increased cooperative interactions and pathway-specific changes in predicted flux. Our results suggest the importance of sampling-based and objective function-independent approaches to evaluate metabolic interactions and emphasize their utility in quantitatively studying interactions between cells and organisms.",

    "abstract": "Natural products are important sources for drug development, and the precise prediction of their structures assembled by modular proteins is an area of great interest. In this study, we introduce DeepT2, an end-to-end, cost-effective, and accurate machine learning platform to accelerate the identification of type II polyketides (T2PKs), which represent a significant portion of the natural product world. Our algorithm is based on advanced natural language processing models and utilizes the core biosynthetic enzyme, chain length factor (CLF or KS{beta}), as computing inputs. The process involves sequence embedding, data labeling, classifier development, and novelty detection, which enable precise classification and prediction directly from KS{beta} without sequence alignments. Combined with metagenomics and metabolomics, we evaluated the ability of DeepT2 and found this model could easily detect and classify KS{beta} either as a single sequence or a mixture of bacterial genomes, and subsequently identify the corresponding T2PKs in a labeled categorized class or as novel. Our work highlights deep learning as a promising framework for genome mining and therefore provides a meaningful platform for discovering medically important natural products.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex meshwork of proteins that forms the scaffold of all tissues in multicellular organisms. It plays critical roles in all aspects of life: from orchestrating cell migration during development, to supporting tissue repair. It also plays critical roles in the etiology or progression of diseases. To study this compartment, we defined the compendium of all genes encoding ECM and ECM-associated proteins for multiple organisms. We termed this compendium the \"matrisome\" and further classified matrisome components into different structural or functional categories. This nomenclature is now largely adopted by the research community to annotate -omics datasets and has contributed to advance both fundamental and translational ECM research. Here, we report the development of Matrisome AnalyzeR, a suite of tools including a web-based application (https://sites.google.com/uic.edu/matrisome/tools/matrisome-analyzer) and an R package (https://github.com/Matrisome/MatrisomeAnalyzeR). The web application can be used by anyone interested in annotating, classifying, and tabulating matrisome molecules in large datasets without requiring programming knowledge. The companion R package is available to more experienced users, interested in processing larger datasets or in additional data visualization options.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTMatrisome AnalyzeR is a suite of tools, including a web-based app and an R package, designed to facilitate the annotation and quantification of extracellular matrix components in big datasets.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) is believed to have a zoonotic origin. Bats are a suspected natural host of SARS-CoV-2 because of sequence homology with other bat coronaviruses. Understanding the origin of the virus and determining species susceptibility is essential for managing the transmission potential during a pandemic. In a previous study, we established an in vitro animal model of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and replication in a non-permissive avian fibroblast cell line (DF1) based on expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) from different animal species. In this work, we express the ACE2 of seven bat species in DF1 cells and determine their ability to support attachment and replication of the original SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan lineage virus, as well as two variants, Delta and Lambda. We demonstrate that the ACE2 receptor of all seven species: little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), great roundleaf bat (Hipposideros armiger), Pearsons horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus pearsonii), greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis), Egyptian rousette (Rousettus aegyptiacus), and Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus), made the DF1 cells permissible to the three isolates of SARS-CoV-2. However, the level of virus replication differed between bat species and variant tested. In addition, the Wuhan lineage SARS-CoV-2 virus replicated to higher titers (104.5-105.5 TCID50) than either variant virus (103.5-104.5 TCID50) on pass 1. Interestingly, all viruses tested grew to higher titers (approximately 106 TCID50) when cells expressed the human ACE2 gene compared to bat ACE2. This study provides a practical in vitro method for further testing of animal species for potential susceptibility to current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 viruses.",

Brachyury/T/TBXT is a major transcription factor for gastrulation, tailbud patterning, and notochord formation; however, how its expression is controlled in the mammalian notochord has remained elusive. Here, we identify the complement of notochord-specific enhancers in the mammalian Brachyury/T/TBXT gene. Using transgenic assays in zebrafish, axolotl, and mouse, we discover three Brachyury-controlling notochord enhancers T3, C, and I in human, mouse, and marsupial genomes. Acting as Brachyury-responsive, auto-regulatory shadow enhancers, deletion of all three enhancers in mouse abolishes Brachyury/T expression selectively in the notochord, causing specific trunk and neural tube defects without gastrulation or tailbud defects. Sequence and functional conservation of Brachyury-driving notochord enhancers with the brachyury/tbxtb loci from diverse lineages of fishes dates their origin to the last common ancestor of jawed vertebrates.

    "abstract": "Micro-RNA (miRNA) genes represent one of the most constrained examples of genetic information found in metazoan genomes. All primary transcripts generated from these elements fold into a short RNA stem-loop structure that is further processed to a *22 bp dsRNA duplex. Incorporation of one of the strands into the RNA Induced Silencing complex (RISC) can then facilitate negative gene expression regulation. While a substantial number of miRNA genes are ancient and highly conserved, many are subject to rapid evolutionary change. Entirely novel miRNA genes have been shown to emerge in a lineage-specific manner in primates and plants. However, the specific mechanisms that generate these genetic elements have not been determined. Here, we show that up to 100 lineage-specific miRNA genes have emerged in primates via mutations caused by template switching during DNA replication. Template-switching mutations (TSMs) are complex mutations that can introduce in a single replication cycle inverted DNA repeats capable of forming perfect hairpin structures. Our findings demonstrate that TSMs are actively generating complex biological sequence variants which in suitable circumstances create miRNA genes from previously non-functional genomic sequences. This mechanism is orders of magnitude faster than others proposed for the de novo creation of genes, enabling near-instant rewiring of genetic information and rapid adaptation to changing environments.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe UTX/KDM6A histone H3K27 demethylase plays an important role in development and is frequently mutated in cancers such as urothelial cancer. Despite many studies on UTX proteins, variations in mRNA splicing have been overlooked.\n\nMethodsUsing Nanopore sequencing, we present a comprehensive analysis of UTX/KDM6A splicing events in human cell lines and in tissue samples from bladder cancer and normal epithelium.\n\nResultsThe central region of UTX mRNAs encoded by exons 12 to 17 undergoes extensive alternative splicing. Up to half of all stable mRNAs (8-48% in bladder tissues and 18-58% in cell lines) are represented by the UTX canonical isoform lacking exon 14 encoding a nuclear localization sequence, hence localize to the nucleus, unlike cytonuclear localization of the canonical isoform. Chromatin association was also higher for exon 14-containing isoform compared to the canonical UTX. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we found that all UTX isoforms integrated into the MLL3 and MLL4, PR-DUB and MiDAC complexes. Interestingly, one of the novel UTX isoforms, which lacks exons 14 and 16, fails to interact with PR-DUB and MiDAC complex members.\n\nConclusionUTX mRNAs undergo extensive alternative splicing that controls the subcellular localization of UTX and its interactions with other chromatin regulatory complexes.\n\nSimple SummaryUTX/KDM6A is a histone H3K27 demethylase and plays an important role in mammalian development and human diseases such as urothelial cancer. We identified a region encompassing exons 12-17 of UTX that undergoes extensive splicing events. As a result, a nuclear localization sequence located in exon14 is missing in a considerable part of UTX transcripts in different cell lines and tissues from normal bladder epithelium and bladder cancer. Mass spectrometry analysis showed a role for this region in binding to the epigenetic PR-DUB and MiDAC complexes. UTX was also more extensively bound to chromatin when the alternative splicing region presented. Our study showed that alternative splicing of UTX transcripts plays an important role in its functions.",

    "abstract": "The recruitment of 53BP1 to chromatin, mediated by its recognition of histone H4 dimethylated at lysine 20 (H4K20me2), is important for DNA double-strand break repair. Using a series of small molecule antagonists, we demonstrate a conformational equilibrium between an open and a pre-existing lowly populated closed state of 53BP1 in which the H4K20me2 binding surface is buried at the interface between two interacting 53BP1 molecules. In cells, these antagonists inhibit the chromatin recruitment of wild type 53BP1, but do not affect 53BP1 variants unable to access the closed conformation despite preservation of the H4K20me2 binding site. Thus, this inhibition operates by shifting the conformational equilibrium toward the closed state. Our work therefore identifies an auto-associated form of 53BP1 -- autoinhibited for chromatin binding -- that can be stabilized by small molecule ligands encapsulated between two 53BP1 protomers. Such ligands are valuable research tools to study the function of 53BP1 and have the potential to facilitate the development of new drugs for cancer therapy.",

Prediction based on the latest sequences shows that the newly emerging lineage BA.5 has the highest risk score and spreads rapidly to become a major epidemic lineage in multiple countries, suggesting that BA.5 bears great potential to be a VOC. In sum, our machine learning model is capable to early predict high-risk variants soon after their emergence, thus greatly improving public health preparedness against the evolving virus.",

    "abstract": "Microbiota are closely associated to human health and disease. Metaproteomics can provide a direct means to identify microbial proteins in microbiota for compositional and functional characterization. However, in-depth and accurate metaproteomics is still limited due to the extreme complexity and high diversity of microbiota samples. One of the main challenges is constructing a protein sequence database that best fits the microbiota sample. Herein, we proposed an accurate taxonomic annotation pipeline from metagenomic data for deep metaproteomic coverage, namely contigs directed gene annotation (ConDiGA). We mixed 12 known bacterial species to derive a synthetic microbial community to benchmark metagenomic and metaproteomic pipelines. With the optimized taxonomic annotation strategy by ConDiGA, we built a protein sequence database from the metagenomic data for metaproteomic analysis and identified about 12,000 protein groups, which was very close to the result obtained with the reference proteome protein sequence database of the 12 species. We also demonstrated the practicability of the method in real fecal samples, achieved deep proteome coverage of human gut microbiome, and compared the function and taxonomy of gut microbiota at metagenomic level and metaproteomic level. Our study can tackle the current taxonomic annotation reliability problem in metagenomics-derived protein sequence database for metaproteomics. The unique dataset of metagenomic and the metaproteomic data of the 12 bacterial species is publicly available as a standard benchmarking sample for evaluating various analysis pipelines. The code of ConDiGA is open access at GitHub for the analysis of real microbiota samples.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has seen large-scale pathogen genomic sequencing efforts, becoming part of the toolbox for surveillance and epidemic research. This resulted in an unprecedented level of data sharing to open repositories, which has actively supported the identification of SARS-CoV-2 structure, molecular interactions, mutations and variants, and facilitated vaccine development and drug reuse studies and design. The European COVID-19 Data Platform was launched to support this data sharing, and has resulted in the deposition of several million SARS-CoV-2 raw reads. In this paper we describe (1) open data sharing, (2) tools for submission, analysis, visualisation and data claiming (e.g. ORCiD), (3) the systematic analysis of these datasets, at scale via the SARS-CoV-2 Data Hubs as well as (4) lessons learned.

    "abstract": "Carnivorous pitcher plants (Nepenthes) are a striking example of a natural pitfall trap. The traps slippery rim, or peristome, plays a critical role in insect capture via an aquaplaning mechanism that is well documented. Whilst the peristome has received significant research attention, the conspicuous variation in peristome geometry across the genus remains unexplored. We examined the mechanics of prey capture using Nepenthes pitcher plants with divergent peristome geometries. Inspired by living materials, we developed a mathematical model that links the peristomes three-dimensional geometries to the physics of prey capture under the laws of Newtonian mechanics. Linking form and function enables us to test hypotheses related to the function of features such as shape and ornamentation, orientation in a gravitational field, and the presence of  teeth, while analysis of the energetic costs and gains of a given geometry provides a means of inferring potential evolutionary pathways. In a separate modeling approach, we show how prey size may correlate with peristome dimensions for optimal capture. Our modeling framework provides a physical platform to understand how divergence in peristome morphology may have evolved in the genus Nepenthes in response to shifts in prey diversity, availability, and size.\n\nSignificance StatementPitcher plants (Nepenthes) produce an astonishing array of leaf-derived traps into which preys (typically insects) slide from a rim (the peristome). How prey capture varies across this varied genus is a mystery. We hypothesized that insects behave differently depending on peristome size and geometry. We examined the physics of prey capture under the laws of Newtonian mechanics to show that prey size and behavior correlate with peristome shape. We conclude that a diversity of peristomes in Nepenthes evolved in response to variation in prey capture.",

    "abstract": "Clusterwise inference is a popular approach in neuroimaging to increase sensitivity, but most existing methods are currently restricted to the General Linear Model (GLM) for testing mean parameters. Statistical methods for variance components testing, which are critical in neuroimaging studies that involve estimation of narrow-sense heritability or test-retest reliability, are seriously underdeveloped due to methodological and computational challenges, which would potentially lead to low power. We propose a fast and powerful test for variance components called CLEAN-V ( CLEAN for testing  Variance components). CLEAN-V models the global spatial dependence structure of imaging data and computes a locally powerful variance component test statistic by data-adaptively pooling neighborhood information. Correction for multiple comparisons is achieved by permutations to control family-wise error rate (FWER). Through analysis of task-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project across five tasks and comprehensive data-driven simulations, we show that CLEAN-V outperforms existing methods in detecting test-retest reliability and narrow-sense heritability with significantly improved power, with the detected areas aligning with activation maps. The computational efficiency of CLEAN-V also speaks of its practical utility, and it is available as an R package.",

    "abstract": "Glial cells, including astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, are brain cells that support and dynamically interact with neurons and each other. These intercellular dynamics undergo changes during stress and disease states. In response to most forms of stress, astrocytes will undergo some variation of activation, meaning upregulation in certain proteins expressed and secreted and either upregulations or downregulations to various constitutive and normal functions. While types of activation are many and contingent on the particular disturbance that triggers these changes, there are two main overarching categories that have been delineated thus far: A1 and A2. Named in the convention of microglial activation subtypes, and with the acknowledgement that the types are not completely distinct or completely comprehensive, the A1 subtype is generically associated with toxic and pro-inflammatory factors, and the A2 phenotype is broadly associated with anti-inflammatory and neurogenic factors. The present study served to measure and document dynamic changes in these subtypes at multiple timepoints using an established experimental model of cuprizone toxic demyelination. The authors found increases in proteins associated with both cell types at different timepoints, with protein increases in the A1 marker C3d and the A2 marker Emp1 in the cortex at one week and protein increases in Emp1 in the corpus callosum at three days and four weeks. There were also increases in Emp1 staining specifically colocalized with astrocyte staining in the corpus callosum at the same timepoints as the protein increases, and in the cortex weeks later at four weeks. C3d colocalization with astrocytes also increased most at four weeks. This indicates simultaneous increases of both types of activation as well as the likely existence of astrocytes expressing both markers. The authors also found the increase in two A1 associated proteins (TNF alpha and C3d) did not show a linear relationship in line with findings from other research and indicating a more complex relationship between cuprizone toxicity and astrocyte activation. The increases in TNF alpha and IFN gamma did not occur at timepoints preceding increases in C3d and Emp1, showing that other factors also precipitate the subtypes associated (A1 for C3d and A2 for Emp1). These findings add to the body of research showing the specific early timepoints at which A1 and A2 markers are most increased during the course of cuprizone treatment, including the fact that these increases can be non-linear in the case of Emp1. This provides additional information on optimal times for targeted interventions during the cuprizone model.",

    "abstract": "During economic choice, we often consider options in alternation, until we commit to one. Nonetheless, neuroeconomics typically ignores the dynamic aspects of deliberation. We trained macaques to perform a value-based decision-making task where two risky offers were presented in sequence at different locations of the visual field, each followed by a delay epoch where offers were invisible. Subjects looked at the offers in sequence, as expected. Surprisingly, during the delay epochs, we found that subjects still tend to look at empty locations where the visual offers were formerly presented; and, moreover, longer fixation to given empty location increases the probability of choosing the associated offer, even after controlling for the offer values. We show that activity in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) reflects the value of the gazed offer, but also the value of the offer associated to the gazed spatial location, even if it is not the most recently viewed. This reactivation reflects a reevaluation process, as fluctuations in neural spiking during offer stimuli presentation and delays correlate with upcoming choice. Our results suggest that look-at-nothing gazing triggers the reactivation of a previously seen offer for further reevaluation, revealing novel aspects of deliberation.",

In this study, Krushinsky-Molodkina (KM) rats genetically prone to audiogenic seizures (AGS) were used. KM rats are characterized by the development of audiogenic epilepsy during postnatal ontogenesis, with AGS onset at the age of 1.5-2 months and fully developed AGS expression by 3rd month. We analyzed GABAergic system of the inferior colliculi (IC) and the hippocampus of KM rats at different stages of postnatal development. Wistar rats were used as a control. In the IC of young KM rats, Na+/K+/Cl- cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) expression was increased, while in adults K+/Cl- cotransporter 2 (KCC2) was downregulated indicating impairment of postsynaptic GABA action both at early and later stages of postnatal development. In the hippocampus of young KM rats, we observed a decrease in activity of GABAergic neurons and downregulation of KCC2 and NKCC1. Adult rats, in opposite, demonstrated elevated activity of the hippocampal GABAergic cells and unchanged expression of chlorine transporters indicating upregulation of GABA transmission. Thus, GABA dysregulation in the IC can mediate the seizure susceptibility in adult KM rats, while in the hippocampus, upregulation of GABAergic system can restrict the spreading of epileptiform activity from the brainstem.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological evidence indicates that early life stress (ES) exposure increases the risk for later-life diseases, such as Alzheimers disease (AD). Accordingly, we and others have shown that ES aggravates the development of, and response to, amyloid-beta (A{beta}) pathology in animal models. Moreover, ES-exposed transgenic APP/PS1 mice display deficits in both cognitive flexibility and synaptic function. As the mechanisms behind these changes were unclear, we here investigated how exposure to ES, using the limited nesting and bedding model, affects the synaptic proteome across 2 different ages in both wildtype and APP/PS1 transgenic mice.\n\nWe found that, compared to wildtype mice, the hippocampal synaptosomes of APP/PS1 mice at an early pathological stage (4 months) showed a higher abundance of mitochondrial proteins and lower levels of proteins involved in actin dynamics. Interestingly, ES exposure in wildtype mice had similar effects on the level of mitochondrial and actin-related synaptosomal proteins at this age, whereas ES exposure had no additional effect on the synaptosomal proteome of early-stage APP/PS1 mice. Accordingly, ultrastructural analysis of the synapse using electron microscopy in a follow-up cohort showed fewer mitochondria in pre- and post-synaptic compartments of APP/PS1 and ES-exposed mice, respectively.\n\nAt a later pathological stage (10 months), the hippocampal synaptic proteome of APP/PS1 mice revealed an upregulation of proteins related to A{beta} processing, that was accompanied by a downregulation of proteins related to postsynaptic receptor endocytosis. ES exposure no longer affected the synaptic proteome of wildtype animals by this age, whereas it affected the expression of astrocytic proteins involved in lipid metabolism in APP/PS1 mice. We confirmed a dysregulation of astrocyte protein expression in a separate cohort of 12-month-old mice, by immunostaining for the alpha subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein and fatty acid synthase in astrocytes.\n\nIn conclusion, our data suggest that ES and amyloidosis share pathogenic pathways involving synaptic mitochondrial dysfunction and astrocytic lipid metabolism. These pathways might be underlying contributors to the long-term aggravation of the APP/PS1 phenotype by ES, as well as to the ES-associated risk for AD progression.\n\nThese data are publicly accessible online as a web app via https://amsterdamstudygroup.shinyapps.io/ES_Synaptosome_Proteomics_Visualizer/.",

    "abstract": "The spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rules are popular in both neuroscience and computer algorithms due to their ability to capture the change in neural connections arising from the correlated activity of neurons. Recent advances in recording technology have made large neural recordings common, but to date, there is no established method for inferring unobserved neural connections and learning rules from them. We use a Bayesian framework and assume neural spike recordings follow a binary data model to infer the connections and their evolution over time from data using STDP rules. We test the resulting method on one simulated and one real case study, where the real case study consists of human electrophysiological recordings. The simulated case study allows validation of the model, and the real case study shows that we are able to infer learning rules from awake human data that align with experimental results in rats and other animals. The real case study also uncovered a trend in maximum synaptic modification and age, however, this will need testing on a larger scale to draw conclusions.\n\nAuthor summaryIn this work, we use single neuron recordings from humans to model plasticity through spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) learning. In humans, the learning rules are studied ex vivo and in vitro, but not in vivo, and even though large neural recordings are easily available, to date there is no established method for inferring unobserved learning rules from them. We present a Bayesian framework for modelling functional connectivity and plasticity in awake humans using STDP learning rules. The human spike recordings are assumed to follow a Bernoulli process, and we model how the connection from a pre-synaptic neuron to a post-synaptic neuron evolve in time. We tested the resulting method on one simulated and one real case study consisting of human spike recordings. With the simulated case study, we verified that the Bayesian model can infer the parameters of the learning rule and returns the true (simulated) values. The real case study shows that we are able to infer learning rules from human data, and we obtain results in line with experimental results in rats and other animals.",

Using a rodent model of ASD here we identify a crucial communication bottleneck between the brainstem and the forebrain, the calretinin-positive neurons in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT/CR+), that controls ASD. We show that following a single acute stress event, the pre-sleep behavior of the mice is altered for several days in parallel with a persistent increase in the firing rate of PVT/CR+ cells. Optogenetic inhibition of PVT/CR+ neuronal activity after the stress event for one hour was sufficient to rescue both the ASD symptoms and the prolonged increase in PVT/CR+ firing rate. Inhibition applied 5 days later was still able to ameliorate some of the symptoms. These data suggest that post-stress activity of PVT/CR+ neurons play a critical role in mediating the acute forms of stress-related affective dysfunctions.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryPost-stress inhibition of paraventricular thalamic neurons prevents the emergence of acute stressed phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is an emerging medical problem worldwide without any cure yet. By 2050, more than 152 million people will be affected. AD is characterized by mitochondrial dys-function (MD) and increased amyloid beta (A{beta}) levels. Coffee is one of the most commonly consumed beverages. It has many bioactive and neuroprotective ingredients of which caffeine (Cof), kahweohl (KW) and cafestol (CF) shows a variety of pharmacological properties such as anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Effects of Cof, KW, and CF were tested in a cel-lular model of AD on MD and A{beta}. SH-SY5Y-APP695 cells were incubated with 50{micro}M Cof, 1{micro}M CF and 1{micro}M KW for 24h. The energetic metabolite ATP was determined using a luciferase-catalyzed bioluminescence assay. The activity of mitochondrial respiration chain complexes was assessed by high-resolution respirometry using a Clarke electrode. Expression levels genes were deter-mined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The levels of amyloid {beta}-protein (A{beta}1-40) were measured using homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF). ROS levels, cAMP levels, and peroxidase activity were determined using a fluorescence assay. The combination of Cof, KW and CF significantly increased ATP levels. The combination had neither a significant effect on MMP, on activity of respiration chain complexes, nor on A{beta}1-40 levels. cAMP levels were slightly increased after incubation with the combination, but not the peroxi-dase activity. Pyruvate levels and the lactate-pyruvate-ration but not lactate levels were signifi- cantly enhanced. No effect was seen on the expression level of lactate dehydrogenase and py-ruvate dehydrogenase kinase. In some experiments we have tested the single substances. They showed significant results especially in ATP, lactate and pyruvate values compared to the con-trol. The combinations have a lesser effect on mitochondrial dysfunction in cells and none on A{beta} production. Whereas ATP levels and pyruvate levels were significantly increased. This suggests a change in glycolysis in neuronal cells harbouring human genes relevant for AD.",

    "abstract": "The spinal dorsal horn comprises heterogeneous neuronal populations, that interconnect with one another to form neural circuits modulating various types of sensory information. Decades of evidence has revealed that transcription factors expressed in each neuronal progenitor subclass play pivotal roles in the cell fate specification of spinal dorsal horn neurons. However, the development of subtypes of these neurons is not fully understood in more detail as yet and warrants the investigation of additional transcription factors. In the present study, we examined the involvement of the POU domain-containing transcription factor Brn3a in the development of spinal dorsal horn neurons. Analyses of Brn3a expression in the developing spinal dorsal horn neurons in mice demonstrated that Brn3a was downregulated in majority of the Brn3a-lineage neurons during embryonic stages (Brn3a-transient neurons), whereas a limited population continued to express Brn3a after E18.5 (Brn3a-persistent neurons). Brn3a knockout disrupted the localization pattern of Brn3a-persistent neurons, indicating a critical role of this transcription factor in the development of these neurons. In contrast, Brn3a overexpression in Brn3a-transient neurons directed their localization in a manner similar to that in Brn3a-persistent neurons. Moreover, Brn3a-overexpressing neurons exhibited increased axonal extension to the ventral and ventrolateral funiculi, where the axonal tracts of Brn3a-persistent neurons reside. These results suggest that Brn3a controls the soma localization and axonal extension patterns of Brn3a-persistent spinal dorsal horn neurons.",

    "abstract": "Sustained attention, the ability to focus on an activity or stimulus over time, is significantly impaired in many psychiatric disorders, and there remains a major unmet need in treating impaired attention. Continuous performance tests (CPTs) were developed to measure sustained attention in humans, non-human primates, rats, and mice, and similar neural circuits are engaged across species during CPT performance, supporting their use in translational studies to identify novel therapeutics. Here, we identified electrophysiological correlates of attentional performance in a touchscreen-based rodent CPT (rCPT) in the locus coeruleus (LC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), two inter-connected regions that are implicated in attentional processes. We used viral labeling and molecular techniques to demonstrate that neural activity is recruited in LC-ACC projections during the rCPT, and that this recruitment increases with cognitive demand. We implanted male mice with depth electrodes within the LC and ACC for local field potential (LFP) recordings during rCPT training, and identified an increase in ACC delta and theta power, and an increase in LC delta power during correct responses in the rCPT. We also found that the LC leads the ACC in theta frequencies during correct responses while the ACC leads the LC in gamma frequencies during incorrect responses. These findings may represent translational biomarkers that can be used to screen novel therapeutics for drug discovery in attention.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe responsiveness of the human brain to external input fluctuates. Timing the external perturbation with regard to the oscillatory brain state may improve the intended stimulation effects. However, current brain state-dependent interventions targeting phases of the oscillatory cycle need to apply prediction algorithms to compensate for latencies between measurement and stimulation, and are therefore imprecise.\n\nObjectiveWe investigated the phase-specific precision of a novel non-predictive approach on the basis of integrated real-time measurement and brain stimulation.\n\nMethodsApplying a simulation, we estimated the circular standard deviation (SD) to hit 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 equidistant phase bins of the oscillatory cycle with high precision. Furthermore, we used electroencephalography-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation in healthy subjects to empirically determine the precision of hitting the targeted phase of the oscillatory cycle for 10 different frequencies from 4Hz to 40Hz using our approach.\n\nResultsThe simulation revealed that SDs of less than 17.6{degrees}, 9.7{degrees}, 5.1{degrees}, 2.5{degrees}, and 1.3{degrees} were necessary to precisely hit 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 distinct phase bins of the oscillatory cycle. By completing measurement, signal-processing and stimulation with a round-time of 1ms, our empirical approach achieved SDs of 0.4{degrees} at 4Hz to 4.3{degrees} at 40Hz. This facilitates selective targeting of 32 phases (at 4Hz), 16 phases (at 8, 12, 16, 20, 24Hz) and 8 phases (at 28, 32, 36, 40Hz), respectively.\n\nConclusionIntegrated real-time measurement and stimulation circumvents the need for prediction and results in more precise phase-specific brain stimulation than with state-of-the-art procedures.",

    "abstract": "Activation of the ER stress sensor IRE1 contributes to neuronal development and is known to induce neuronal remodeling in vitro and in vivo. On the other hand, excessive IRE1 activity is often detrimental and may contribute to neurodegeneration. To determine the consequences of increased activation of IRE1, we used a mouse model expressing a C148S variant of IRE1 with increased and sustained activation. Surprisingly, the mutation did not affect the differentiation of highly secretory antibody-producing cells, but exhibited a strong protective effect in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Significant improvement in motor function was found in IRE1C148S mice with EAE relative to WT mice. Coincident with this improvement, there was reduced microgliosis in the spinal cord of IRE1C148S mice, with reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. This was accompanied by reduced axonal degeneration and enhanced CNPase levels, suggestiing improved myelin integrity. Interestingly, while the IRE1C148S mutation is expressed in all cells, the reduction in proinflammatory cytokines and in the activation of microglial activation marker IBA1, along with preservation of phagocytic gene expression, all point to microglia as the cell type contributing to the clinical improvement in IRE1C148S animals. Our data suggest that sustained increase in IRE1 activity can be protective in vivo, and that this protection is cell type and context dependent. Considering the overwhelming but conflicting evidence for the role of the ER stress in neurological diseases, a better understanding of the function of ER stress sensors in physiological contexts is clearly needed.",

    "abstract": "During development, multicellular rosettes serve as important cellular intermediates in the formation of diverse organ systems. Multicellular rosettes are transient epithelial structures that are defined by the apical constriction of cells towards the rosette center. Due to the important role these structures play during development, understanding the molecular mechanisms by which rosettes are formed and maintained is of high interest. Utilizing the zebrafish posterior lateral line primordium (pLLP) as a model system, we identify the RhoA GEF Mcf2lb as a regulator of rosette integrity. The pLLP is a group of [~]150 cells that migrates along the zebrafish trunk and is organized into epithelial rosettes; these are deposited along the trunk and will differentiate into sensory organs called neuromasts (NMs). Using single-cell RNA sequencing and whole-mount in situ hybridization, we showed that mcf2lb is expressed in the pLLP during migration. Given the known role of RhoA in rosette formation, we asked whether Mcf2lb plays a role in regulating apical constriction of cells within rosettes. Live imaging and subsequent 3D analysis of mcf2lb mutant pLLP cells showed disrupted apical constriction and subsequent rosette organization. This in turn resulted in a unique posterior Lateral Line phenotype: an excess number of deposited NMs along the trunk of the zebrafish. Cell polarity markers ZO-1 and Par-3 were apically localized, indicating that pLLP cells are normally polarized. In contrast, signaling components that mediate apical constriction downstream of RhoA, Rock-2a and non-muscle Myosin II were diminished apically. Altogether our results suggest a model whereby Mcf2lb activates RhoA, which in turn activates downstream signaling machinery to induce and maintain apical constriction in cells incorporated into rosettes.",

We established robust expression of EGFP and mScarlet fluorescent proteins in insulin- and glucagon-expressing cells respectively without compromising the differentiation or function of these cells. We also showed the insulin- and glucagon-expressing bihormonal population at the maturing endocrine cell stage (Stage 6) lose insulin expression over time, while maintaining an alpha-like expression profile, suggesting these bihormonal cells are preferentially fated to become alpha-like cells in vitro. Together, the INSEGFPGCGmScarlet hESC line provides an efficient strategy for tracking populations of hESC-derived beta- and alpha-like cells.",

    "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen with a polysaccharide capsule that becomes greatly enlarged in the mammalian host and during in vitro growth in response to host-like conditions. To understand how individual host-like signals affect capsule size and gene expression, we grew cells with and without all combinations of 5 signals suspected of affecting capsule size and systematically measured cell and capsule sizes of 47,458 cells. We also collected samples for RNA-Seq at 30, 90, 180, and 1440 minutes and carried out RNA-Seq in quadruplicate, yielding 881 RNA-Seq samples. This massive, uniformly collected dataset will be a significant resource for the research community. Analysis revealed that capsule induction requires both tissue culture medium and either CO2 or exogenous cyclic AMP, a second messenger. Rich medium (YPD) blocks capsule growth completely, DMEM permits it, and RPMI yields the largest capsules. Medium has the biggest impact on overall gene expression, followed by CO2, mammalian body temperature (37{degrees} compared to 30{degrees}), and then cAMP. Surprisingly, adding CO2 or cAMP pushes overall gene expression in the opposite direction from tissue culture media, even though both tissue culture medium and CO2 or cAMP are required for capsule development. By modeling the relationship between gene expression and capsule size, we identified novel genes whose deletion affects capsule size.",

We find that stigmergic interactions can help groups to collectively find the cells with the highest values in a table of hidden numbers. We show that individuals can be classified into three behavioral profiles that differ in their degree of cooperation.

    "abstract": "Walking is a slow gait which is particularly adaptable to meet internal or external needs and is prone to maladaptive alterations that lead to gait disorders. Alterations can affect speed, but also style (the way one walks). While slowed speed may signify the presence of a problem, style represents the hallmark essential for clinical classification of gait disorders. However, it has been challenging to objectively capture key stylistic features while uncovering neural substrates driving these features. Here we revealed brainstem hotspots that drive strikingly different walking styles by employing an unbiased mapping assay that combines quantitative walking signatures with focal, cell type specific activation. We found that activation of inhibitory neurons that mapped to the ventromedial caudal pons induced slow motion-like style. Activation of excitatory neurons that mapped to the ventromedial upper medulla induced shuffle-like style. Contrasting shifts in walking signatures distinguished these styles. Activation of inhibitory and excitatory neurons outside these territories or of serotonergic neurons modulated walking speed, but without walking signature shifts. Consistent with their contrasting modulatory actions, hotspots for slow-motion and shuffle-like gaits preferentially innervated different substrates. These findings lay the basis for new avenues to study mechanisms underlying (mal)adaptive walking styles and gait disorders.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/537568v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e88ef1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@100a47corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12ecc7borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@172bd97_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Primary sensory cortices process atypical sensory objects in some conditions, which brings into question their presumed sensory specificity. Whether this atypical sensory processing originates from true atypical sensory processing or from cross-modal associations to objects is not known. Visual/auditory objects typically have strong reciprocal associations; hence, it is difficult to address this question in these modalities. Here, we instead use the olfactory system as a model system. We show that even in total absence of any odor reference, the posterior piriform cortex (PPC; odor object processing) is activated by both sounds and pictures of objects. This activation is independent of the objects odor associations, thereby demonstrating that the activity is not due to cross-modal associations. In the anterior piriform cortex (APC; low-level odor processing) we found activation by sounds, again independent of odor associations. Analogously, we found clear cross-modal effects in visual and auditory brain regions: Pictures activated higher-level auditory cortex and caused a decreased signal in primary auditory cortex, whereas sounds activated primary visual cortex and caused a decreased signal in higher-level visual cortex. Our findings demonstrate an atypical sensory processing that is independent of cross-modal associations in olfactory cortices and contribute to a more nuanced view of modality specificity in olfactory, auditory, and visual cortices.",

    "abstract": "One of the potential and promising adjuvant therapies for Alzheimers disease is that of non-invasive transcranial neurostimulation to potentiate cognitive training interventions. Conceptually, this is achieved by driving brain dynamics towards an optimal state for an effective facilitation of cognitive training interventions. However, current neurostimulation protocols rely on experimental trial-and-error approaches that result in variability of symptom improvements and suboptimal progress. Here, we leveraged whole-brain computational modelling by assessing the regional susceptibility towards optimal brain dynamics from Alzheimers disease. In practice, we followed the three-part concept of Dynamic Sensitivity Analysis by first understanding empirical differences between healthy controls and patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia due to Alzheimers Disease; secondly, by building computational models for all individuals in the mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia cohorts; and thirdly, by perturbing brain regions and assessing the impact on the recovery of brain dynamics to the healthy state (here defined in functional terms, summarised by a measure of metastability for the healthy group). By doing so, we show the importance of key regions, along the anterior-posterior medial line, in driving in-silico improvement of mild dementia and mild cognitive impairment groups. Moreover, this subset consists mainly of regions with high structural nodal degree. Overall, this in-silico perturbational approach could inform the design of stimulation strategies for re-establishing healthy brain dynamics, putatively facilitating effective cognitive interventions targeting the cognitive decline in Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "Arrhythmia is considered the most disrupted state of the biological circadian clock, and usually occurs when circadian regulatory genes are rendered non-functional, or the master clock (Suprachiasmatic Nucleus) is ablated. Since clock gene expression is aligned by the external solar day-night cycle to exhibit a 24-hour rhythm, we hypothesized that ill-timed light and dark exposure could negatively impact endogenous circadian clock function in mice. In this study, we present an environmentally driven approach to induce arrhythmia in mice that is also reversible. Using the previously characterized fragmented day-night cycle (FDN) where the 8-hour night is split into four 2-hour fragments and equally distributed across the 24-hour day, we show that mice gradually exposed to the FDN for 1 month lose their circadian rhythmicity. Furthermore, subsequent exposure to constant light or constant dark conditions does not yield typical circadian rhythms, but instead, reveals circadian arrhythmia. Finally, we show that the arrhythmic locomotion phenotype is reversible with one week of reintroduction to a 12 hr day-12 hr night cycle. This is the first study to show how the light-dark environment induces arrhythmia of an intact circadian clock and how it can be reversed.",

    "abstract": "Brain functional connectivity analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is typically performed in a standardized template space assuming consistency of connections across subjects. This can come in the form of one-edge-at-a-time analyses or dimension reduction/decomposition methods. Common to these approaches is the assumption of complete localization (or spatial alignment) of brain regions across subjects. Alternative approaches completely eschew localization assumptions by treating connections as statistically exchangeable (for example, using the density of connectivity between nodes). Yet other approaches, such as hyperalignment, attempt to align subjects on function as well as structure, thereby achieving a different sort of template-based localization. In this paper, we propose the use of simple regression models to characterize connectivity. To that end, we build regression models on subject-level Fisher transformed regional connection matrices using geographic distance, homotopic distance, network labels, and region indicators as covariates to explain variation in connections. While we perform our analysis in template-space in this paper, we envision the method being useful in multi-atlas registration settings, where subject data remains in its own geometry and templates are warped instead. A byproduct of this style of analysis is the ability to characterize the fraction of variation in subject-level connections explained by each type of covariate. Using Human Connectome Project data, we found that network labels and regional characteristics contribute far more than geographic or homotopic relationships (considered non-parametrically). In addition, visual regions had the highest explanatory power (i.e., largest regression coefficients). We also considered subject repeatability and found that the degree of repeatability seen in fully localized models is largely recovered using our proposed subject-level regression models. Further, even fully exchangeable models retain a sizeable amount of repeatability information, despite discarding all localization information. These results suggest the tantalizing possibility that fMRI connectivity analysis can be performed in subject-space, using less aggressive registration, such as simple affine transformations, multi-atlas subject-space registration, or perhaps even no registration whatsoever.",

Here, we applied the 10x Genomics Visium Spatial Proteogenomics (Visium-SPG) platform, which measures spatial gene expression coupled with immunofluorescence protein co-detection, in post-mortem human brain tissue from individuals with late-stage Alzheimers disease (AD) to investigate changes in spatial gene expression with respect to amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) and hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) pathology. We identified A{beta}-associated transcriptomic signatures in the human inferior temporal cortex (ITC) during late-stage AD, which we further investigated at cellular resolution with combined immunofluorescence and single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) co-detection technology. We present a workflow for analysis of Visium-SPG data and demonstrate the power of multi-omic profiling to identify spatially-localized changes in molecular dynamics that are linked to pathology in human brain disease.

    "abstract": "All vertebrate species express two independently-encoded forms of translation elongation factor eEF1A. In humans and mice eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 are 92% identical at the amino acid level, but the well conserved developmental switch between the two variants in specific tissues suggests the existence of important functional differences. Heterozygous mutations in eEF1A2 result in neurodevelopmental disorders in humans; the mechanism of pathogenicity is unclear, but one hypothesis is that there is a dominant negative effect on eEF1A1 during development. The high degree of similarity between the eEF1A proteins has complicated expression analysis in the past; here we describe a gene edited mouse line in which we have introduced a V5 tag in the gene encoding eEF1A2. Expression analysis using anti-V5 and anti-eEF1A1 antibodies demonstrates that, in contrast to the prevailing view that eEF1A2 is only expressed postnatally, it is expressed from as early as E11.5 in the developing neural tube. Two colour immunofluorescence also reveals coordinated switching between eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 in different regions of postnatal brain. Completely reciprocal expression of the two variants is seen in post-weaning mouse brain with eEF1A1 expressed in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes and eEF1A2 in neuronal soma. Although eEF1A1 is absent from neuronal cell bodies after development, it is widely expressed in axons. This expression does not appear to coincide with myelin sheaths originating from oligodendrocytes but rather results from localised translation within the axon, suggesting that both variants are transcribed in neurons but show completely distinct subcellular localisation at the protein level. These findings will form an underlying framework for understanding how missense mutations in eEF1A2 result in neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "Lumens or fluid-filled cavities are a ubiquitous feature of mammals and are often evolutionarily linked to the origin of body-plan complexity. Post-implantation, the pluripotent epiblast in a human embryo forms a central lumen, paving the way for gastrulation. While osmotic pressure gradients drive lumen formation in many developmental contexts, mechanisms of human epiblast lumenogenesis are unknown. Here, we study lumenogenesis in a pluripotent-stem-cell-based model of the epiblast using engineered hydrogels that model the confinement faced by the epiblast in the blastocyst. Actin polymerization into a dense mesh-like network at the apical surface generates forces to drive early lumen expansion, as leaky junctions prevent osmotic pressure gradients. Theoretical modeling reveals that apical actin polymerization into a stiff network drives lumen opening, but predicts that a switch to pressure driven lumen growth at larger lumen sizes is required to avoid buckling of the cell layer. Consistent with this prediction, once the lumen reaches a radius of around 12 m, tight junctions mature, and osmotic pressure gradients develop to drive further lumen growth. Human epiblasts show a transcriptional signature of actin polymerization during early lumenogenesis. Thus, actin polymerization drives lumen opening in the human epiblast, and may serve as a general mechanism of lumenogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted proteins governs embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis through the Gli family of transcription factors. Gli is thought to be activated at the tip of primary cilium, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Unc-51-like kinase 4 (Ulk4), a pseudokinase and a member of the Ulk kinase family, acts in conjunction with another Ulk family member Stk36 to promote Gli2 phosphorylation and Hh pathway activation. Ulk4 interacts with Stk36 through its N-terminal region containing the pseudokinase domain and Gli2 via its regulatory domain to bridge the kinase and substrate. Although dispensable for Hh-induced Stk36 kinase activation, Ulk4 is essential for Stk36 ciliary tip localization, Gli2 phosphorylation and activation. In response to Hh, both Ulk4 and Stk36 colocalize with Gli2 at ciliary tip, and Ulk4 and Stk36 depend on each other for their ciliary tip accumulation. We further show that ciliary localization of Ulk4 depends on Stk36 kinase activity and phosphorylation of Ulk4 on Thr1023, and that ciliary tip accumulation of Ulk4 is essential for its function in the Hh pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that Ulk4 regulates Hh signaling by promoting Stk36-mediated Gli2 phosphorylation and activation at ciliary tip.",

The availability of sensory information is influenced by environmental conditions and changes in the physical environment that can alter the sensory environment of the fish, which in turn affects individual and group movements. In this study, we combine experiments and data-driven modeling to investigate the impact of varying levels of light intensity on social interactions and collective behavior in rummy-nose tetra fish. The trajectories of single fish and groups of fish swimming in a tank under different lighting conditions were analyzed to quantify their movements and spatial distribution. Interaction functions between two individuals and the fish interaction with the tank wall were reconstructed and modeled for each light condition. Our results demonstrate that light intensity strongly modulates social interactions between fish and their reactions to obstacles, which then impact collective motion patterns that emerge at the group level.",

    "abstract": "Developments in automated animal tracking software are increasing the efficiency of data collection and improving the standardization of behavioural measurements. There are now several open-source tools for tracking laboratory animals, but often these are only accurate under limited conditions (e.g. uniform lighting and background, uncluttered scenes, unobstructed focal animal). Tracking fish presents a particular challenge for these tools because movement at the waters surface introduces significant noise. Partial occlusion of the focal animal can also be troublesome, particularly when tracking the whole organism. We conducted a behavioural experiment that required us to track the trajectory of a fish as it swam through a field of obstacles. In addition to measuring the bodys trajectory, we also needed to record the position of the obstacles, and to identify when the fish passed through the  virtual gates between adjacent obstacles and/or the aquarium wall. We automated data collection by employing a range of computer vision and computational geometry algorithms (e.g. object detection and tracking, optical flow, parallel plane homology mapping, Voronoi tessellation). Our workflow is divided into several discrete steps, and provides a set of modular software building blocks that can be adapted to analyse other experimental designs. A detailed tutorial is provided, together with all the data and code required to reproduce our results.",

    "abstract": "Individual vocal recognition - the ability to discriminate between individuals based on sound - is thought to be particularly useful for social species that regularly lose visual contact between group members. For instance, individuals living in a fission-fusion group that feed on patchily distributed food in a complex physical environment (e.g., dense forest) are likely to depend heavily on vocalisation to identify individuals that are good at finding food. Spider monkeys (Ateles spp.) live in such environments and have distinctive individual contact calls (whinnies). We used a habituation-dishabituation playback-paradigm to investigate whether black-headed spider monkeys (A. fusciceps) are able to discriminate between female individuals in their group. We found that a group of captive spider monkeys was able to discriminate between individuals using those contact calls. Although many primate species have been found to have individual characteristics in their calls, this is one of the few direct experimental evidence of vocal recognition using a habituation-dishabituation paradigm.",

    "abstract": "The fish farms are increasingly growing and, consequently, the use of antibiotics in aquaculture. Oxytetracycline (OTC) and Florfenicol (FF) are the most common antibiotics applied in the fish production sector and livestock farming. The elucidation of the effects of the antibiotics is essential to control their use and their physiological and pharmacological implications. Here we studied the behavioral effects of the 96 h-exposure to OTC (2, 10, 20, and 100 mg/L), FF (0.01, 0.05, 2 and 10 mg/L) or OTC (10 mg/L) + FF (10 mg/L) in zebrafish larvae. We observed that the covered distance and the movement increased in animals exposed to OTC + FF when compared to control. In addition, fish entered the center of the plate test more often and stayed there longer. The turn angle was reduced at OTC + FF. We also observed that the optomotor response was compromised by 10 and 20 mg/L OTC and to OTC + FF. Our data demonstrated that there is an increase in the number of entries in the center area and time spent in center area for FF- and OTC + FF-treated groups. These data showed that the antibiotics promoted a reduction of anxiety-like behavior allowing larvae to explore more the novel environment as well as a detrimental performance for the optomotor response.\n\nHighlightsO_LIFlorfenicol (FF) did not alter exploratory and anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish larvae.\nC_LIO_LIOxytetracycline (OTC) did not alter exploratory behavior, but there was an increase in the time spent in the center area\nC_LIO_LIOTC plus FF increased distance and movement in zebrafish larvae.\nC_LIO_LIOTC plus FF reduced the anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish larvae.\nC_LIO_LIOptomotor behavior was compromised by treatments with OTC or OTC + FF.\nC_LI\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=116 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/537675v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d16125org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@140d161org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7237eborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b5496e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Transfer learning has enabled work in non-model species, but still requires hand-annotation of example footage, and is only performant in well-defined conditions. To overcome these limitations, we created replicAnt, a configurable pipeline implemented in Unreal Engine 5 and Python, designed to generate large and variable training datasets on consumer-grade hardware instead. replicAnt places 3D animal models into complex, procedurally generated environments, from which automatically annotated images can be exported. We demonstrate that synthetic data generated with replicAnt can significantly reduce the hand-annotation required to achieve benchmark performance in common applications such as animal detection, tracking, pose-estimation, and semantic segmentation; and that it increases the subject-specificity and domaininvariance of the trained networks, so conferring robustness. In some applications, replicAnt may even remove the need for hand-annotation altogether.

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can establish acute and chronic infections in individuals that lack fully functional innate immunity. In particular, phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages is a key mechanism that modulates host control and clearance of P. aeruginosa. Individuals with neutropenia or cystic fibrosis are highly susceptible to P. aeruginosa infection thus underscoring the importance of the host innate immune response. Cell-to-cell contact between host innate immune cells and the pathogen, a first step in phagocytic uptake, is facilitated by simple and complex glycan structures present at the host cell surface. We have previously shown that endogenous polyanionic N-linked glycans localized to the cell surface of phagocytes mediate binding and subsequent phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa. However, the suite of glycans that P. aeruginosa binds to on host phagocytic cells remains poorly characterized. Here we demonstrate, with the use of exogenous N-linked glycans and a glycan array, that P. aeruginosa PAO1 preferentially attaches to a subset of glycans, including a bias towards monosaccharide versus more complex glycan structures. Consistent with these findings, we were able to competitively inhibit bacterial adherence and uptake by the addition of exogenous N-linked mono- and di-saccharide glycans. We discuss of findings in the context of previous reports of P. aeruginosa glycan binding.\n\nIMPORTANCEP. aeruginosa binds to a variety of glycans as part of its interaction with host cells, and a number of P. aeruginosa-encoded receptors and target ligands have been described that allow this microbe to bind to such glycans. Here we extend this work by studying the glycans used by P. aeruginosa PAO1 to bind to phagocytic cells and by using a glycan array to characterize the suite of such molecules that could facilitate host cell-binding by this microbe. This study provides an increased understanding of the glycans bound by P. aeruginosa, and furthermore, provides a useful dataset for future studies of P. aeruginosa-glycan interactions.",

Here we determine a structure of a bacterial GSDM (bGSDM) pore and define a conserved mechanism of pore assembly. Engineering a panel of bGSDMs for site-specific proteolytic activation, we demonstrate that diverse bGSDMs form distinct pore sizes that range from smaller mammalian-like assemblies to exceptionally large pores containing >50 protomers. We determine a 3.3 [A] cryo-EM structure of a Vitiosangium bGSDM in an active slinky-like oligomeric conformation and analyze bGSDM pores in a native lipid environment to create an atomic-level model of a full 52-mer bGSDM pore. Combining our structural analysis with molecular dynamics simulations and cellular assays, we define a stepwise model of GSDM pore assembly and demonstrate that pore formation is driven by local unfolding of membrane-spanning {beta}-strand regions and pre-insertion of a covalently bound palmitoyl into the target membrane. These results yield insights into the diversity of GSDM pores found in nature and the function of an ancient post-translational modification in enabling a programmed host cell death process.",

    "abstract": "DNA amplicon-based microbiota profiling currently relies on polymorphisms in microbial marker genes to estimate species diversity and abundance. However, this technique cannot resolve genetic differences among microbial individuals of the same species. We report here the development of modular bacterial tags (MoBacTags) encoding DNA barcodes. These tags facilitate tracking of near-isogenic bacterial commensals in synthetic communities (SynComs), which allow assessment of the contributions of individual bacterial genes to root microbiota establishment in Arabidopsis thaliana. Chromosomally-integrated DNA barcodes are co-amplified with endogenous marker genes of the community by integrating corresponding primer binding sites into the barcode. We generated MoBacTag-labeled strains of wild-type Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 and of pqqF and cyoB mutants with known defects in gluconic acid-mediated host immunosuppression and validated reduced root colonization of both mutants in a 15-member synthetic microbiota. We detected a reduced SynCom load on roots in the presence of the WCS358:pqqF mutant, but not WCS358:cyoB, revealing distinct pqqF and cyoB activities in a community context. Using MoBacTags, we also show that WCS358 pqqF mutant-specific colonization and community establishment is not trans-complemented by wild-type WCS358. Given that gluconic acid production in P. capeferrum is indirectly abolished in the pqqF mutant by disruption of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) biosynthesis, we propose that drastic changes in the root-associated community result from depletion of the cofactor PQQ, which might serve as a common good during root microbiota establishment. Our proof-of-principle experiments illustrate how MoBacTags can be applied to assess scaling of individual bacterial genetic determinants in the plant microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Calcium (Ca2+) is an important second messenger for activating stress response signalling and cell adaptation in eukaryotic cells yet intracellular Ca2+-dynamics in fungi is poorly understood due to lack of effective real-time Ca2+ reporters. We engineered the GCaMP6f construct for use in the fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, and used live-cell imaging to observe dynamic Ca2+ spiking as well as slower changes in ambient Ca2+-GCaMP levels elicited by stress or gene deletion. Short-term exposure to membrane, osmotic or oxidative stress generated immediate stress-specific responses and repeated exposure revealed differential recovery signatures. Osmotic stress caused yeast cell shrinkage and no adaptation response, where Ca2+-GCaMP spiking was inhibited by 1 M NaCl but not by 0.66 M CaCl2. Treatment with SDS caused a spike-burst, raised ambient Ca2+-GCaMP levels and significant cell death, but surviving cells adapted over subsequent exposures. Treatment with 5 mM H2O2 abolished spiking and caused transient autofluorescence but cells adapted such that spiking returned and autofluorescence diminished on repeated exposure. Adaptation to H2O2 was dependent on Cap1, extracellular Ca2+ and calcineurin, but not on its downstream target, Crz1. Ca2+-dynamics were not affected by H2O2 in the hog1{Delta} or yvc1{Delta} mutants, suggesting a pre-adapted, resistant state, possibly due to changes in membrane permeability. Live-cell imaging of Ca2+-GCaMP responses in individual cells has therefore revealed the dynamics of Ca2+-influx, signalling and homeostasis and their role in the temporal stress response signatures of C. albicans.",

    "abstract": "2The antimicrobial resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoea to all classes of current available antibiotics is a global concern. National surveillance programmes monitoring the susceptibility profiles of Neisseria gonorrhoeae hardly exist in resource constraint settings. Therefore, little is known about the antimicrobial susceptibility profile and associated genetic resistance mechanisms of N. gonorrhoeae in Madagascar. We report susceptibility data of N. gonorrhoeae isolates obtained by the medical laboratory of the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar, from 2014 -2020. In addition, we present data on the antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and antimicrobial resistance profile of a subset of isolates (N=46), including all isolates available of 2020. Over the study period, ceftriaxone resistant isolates exceeding the threshold of 5% in 2017 and 2020, were reported. Of the subset of re-tested isolates, all were found susceptible to ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and spectinomycin. Conversely, all isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin and the majority was also resistant to penicillin and tetracycline. None of the isolates carried the mosaic penA gene and chromosomal mutations associated to the antibiotic resistance in gyrA, parC, penA, ponA, porB and mtrR genes were detected. The high rate of resistance to Penicillin and Tetracycline is explained by the presence of {beta}-lactamase blaTEM and tetM genes, respectively, a plasmid mediated resistance. We found a high number of circulating multilocus sequence types. Almost half of them were new types, and one of them was among the four most predominant sequence types. Our report provides a detailed dataset obtained through phenotypic and genotypic methods which will serve as baseline for future surveillance of N. gonorrhoeae in our setting, and Madagascar.\n\n1.5 RepositoriesThis Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the Accession BioProject PRJNA929018.\n\n3 Impact statementNeisseria gonorrhoeae is becoming increasingly resistant to all classes of antibiotics available for infections treatment.\n\nResource constraint settings encounter difficulties in implementing surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae. We report here antimicrobial susceptibility results from gonorrhoea among patients consulting a medical laboratory in Antananarivo, Madagascar in 2014-2020. We used whole-genome sequencing to identify resistance mechanisms in a subset of isolates including all viable isolates of 2020.\n\nWe report multilocus sequence types and discuss phenotypes and genotypes according to the phylogenetic analysis of the isolates. The susceptibility results are the first in a decade to be reported. We set the baseline to study further the evolution and transmission of N. gonorrhoeae resistance mechanisms and genotypes in general. Our report will enable improving surveillance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in Madagascar and Africa.\n\nOverall, it will contribute to the global, regional, and national surveillance of N. gonorrhoeae. In addition, it may set a benchmark for implementation in other settings facing barriers implementing phenotypic resistance surveillance of N. gonorrhoeae.\n\n4 Data summaryThe source code of the Tormes pipeline used in this study is also available on Github: https://github.com/nmquijada/tormes.\n\nThe SRA sequences have been deposited in the NCBI SRA database under accession numbers SRR23260223 and SRR23260193.\n\nThe genome assemblies can be accessed using the accession numbers: SAMN32949360 - SAMN32949405.\n\nThe MLST genes of all isolates can be accessed through this link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7581537\n\nThe Perl scripts used for a quality filtering of the assemblies which is to remove small contigs can be accessed through the following link: https://github.com/Alainnoah/Remove-Small-Contigs-Draft-Assemblies.\n\nGenomic analysis with metadata in Pathogenwatch could be accessed with this link: https://pathogen.watch/collection/f7t4wjtjlybh-mdgwhofa\n\nA visualization of genomic epidemiology of our isolates with Microreact can be accessed with this link: https://microreact.org/project/7FADQYwhm5h1zJyJTynM6R-unnamed-project\n\nA supplementary material in an Excel sheet summarizing the lists of plasmids used for alignment (Table S1), the statistics of the sequences (Table S2), and the minimum inhibitory concentration values of N. gonorrhoeae isolates and their antimicrobial resistance genetic mechanisms (Table S3) is available through this link: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21973511",

    "abstract": "Colletotrichum higginsianum is a hemibiotrophic pathogen that causes anthracnose disease on crucifer hosts, including Arabidopsis thaliana. Despite the availability of genomic and transcriptomic information and the ability to transform both organisms, identifying C. higginsianum genes involved in virulence has been challenging due to their recalcitrance to gene targeting and redundancy of virulence factors. To overcome these obstacles, we developed an efficient method for multiple gene disruption in C. higginsianum by combining CRISPR-Cas9 and URA3-based marker recycling systems. Our method significantly increased the efficiency of gene knock-out via homologous recombination by introducing genomic DNA double-strand breaks. We demonstrated the applicability of the URA3-based marker recycling system for multiple gene targeting in the same strain. Using our technology, we successfully targeted two melanin biosynthetic genes, SCD1 and PKS1, which resulted in deficiency in melanisation and pathogenicity in the mutants. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our developments in analysing virulence factors in C. higginsianum, thus accelerating research on plant-fungus interactions.",

    "abstract": "Methanogens are a diverse group of Archaea that couple energy conservation to the production of methane gas. While most methanogens have no alternate mode of energy conservation, strains like Methanosarcina acetivorans are known to also conserve energy by dissimilatory metal reduction (DSMR) in the presence of soluble ferric iron or iron-containing minerals. The ecological ramifications of energy conservation decoupled from methane production in methanogens are substantial, yet the molecular details are poorly understood. In this work, we conducted in vitro and in vivo studies with a multiheme c-type cytochrome (MHC), called MmcA, to establish its role during methanogenesis and DSMR in M. acetivorans. MmcA purified from M. acetivorans can donate electrons to methanophenazine, a membrane-bound electron carrier, to facilitate methanogenesis. In addition, MmcA can also reduce Fe(III) and the humic acid analog anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) during DSMR. Furthermore, mutants lacking mmcA have slower Fe(III) reduction rates. The redox reactivities of MmcA are consistent with the electrochemical data where MmcA displays reversible redox features ranging from -100 to -450 mV versus SHE. MmcA is prevalent in members of the Order Methanosarcinales but does not belong to a known family of MHCs linked to extracellular electron transfer, bioinformatically, and instead forms a distinct clade that is closely related to octaheme tetrathionate reductases. Taken together, this study shows that MmcA is widespread in methanogens with cytochromes where it acts as an electron conduit to support a variety of energy conservation strategies that extend beyond methanogenesis.",

Our understanding of drug resistant within-host sub-populations and the frequency of resistance conferring mutations in minority variants remains limited.\n\nM. tuberculosis sequences recovered from liquid cultures of culture-confirmed TB cases notified between January 2017 and December 2021 in New South Wales, Australia were examined. Potential drug resistance conferring minority variants were identified using LoFreq, and mixed populations of different M. tuberculosis strains ([&ge;]100 SNPs apart) were examined using QuantTB.\n\nA total of 1831 routinely sequenced M. tuberculosis strains were included in the analysis. Drug resistance conferring minority variants were detected in 3.5% (65/1831) of sequenced cultures; 84.6% (55/65) had majority strains that were drug susceptible and 15.4% (10/65) had majority strains that were drug resistant. Minority variants with high confidence drug resistance conferring mutations were 1.5 times more common when the majority strains were drug resistant. Mixed M. tuberculosis strain populations were documented in 10.0% (183/1831) of specimens. Minority variants with high confidence drug resistance conferring mutations were more frequently detected in mixed M. tuberculosis strain populations (2.7%, 5/183) than in single strain populations (0.6%, 10/1648; p=0.01).\n\nDrug resistant minority variants require careful monitoring in settings that implement routine M. tuberculosis sequencing. The frequency with which drug resistant minority variants are detected is influenced by selective culture methods and culture-independent sequencing should provide a more accurate picture.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus (CoV) spikes mediate receptor binding and membrane fusion, making them prime targets for neutralising antibodies. In the cases of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV, spikes transition freely between open and closed conformations to balance host cell attachment and immune evasion. The open conformation exposes domain S1B, allowing it to bind to proteinaceous cell surface receptors. It also facilitates protein refolding during spike-mediated membrane fusion. However, with a single exception, the pre-fusion spikes of all other CoVs studied so far have been observed exclusively in the closed state. This raises the possibility of regulation, where spikes more commonly transition to open states in response to specific cues, rather than spontaneously. In our study, using cryo-EM and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the spike protein of the common cold human coronavirus HKU1 undergoes local and long-range conformational changes upon binding a sialoglycan-based primary receptor to domain S1A. This binding triggers the transition of S1B domains to the open state via allosteric inter-domain cross-talk. Our findings paint a more elaborate picture of CoV attachment, with possibilities of dual receptor usage and priming of entry as a means of immune escape.",

    "abstract": "Clonal cultures exhibit phenotypic variation in spite of being composed of genetically identical cells under equal environmental conditions. Proliferation rate is one of the characters that have been described to show this heterogeneity, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are still poorly understood. Cell cycle regulation controls proliferative capacity and previous transcriptomic studies revealed that budding yeast microcolonies with low proliferation rates display high levels of the G1-S transition inhibitor Whi5. This regulator, which, in budding yeast, plays a similar role to Retinoblastoma protein in mammalian cells, has been also linked to replicative aging in very late steps of mother cells lifespan. In this work, we combined single cell microencapsulation with confocal microscopy to study heterogeneity in clonal cultures. Using this new method, we found that a significant proportion of slow-growing microcolonies are founded by mother cells with a very short number of cell cycles. We also found that the reduction in the proliferation capacity of microcolonies founded by young mother cells is related to the expression levels of Whi5, which increases with the number of mother cell replication rounds since early stages. Our results establish that the proliferative structure of a cell population is cumulatively shaped in every mitotic cycle, when a mother cell has the opportunity to increase Whi5 expression levels and develop a slow proliferating lineage.\n\nSignificance StatementProliferative heterogeneity has been widely described in clonal cultures, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are still poorly understood. In this work we have developed a new technology combining single cell microencapsulation with confocal microscopy to dissect cell lineages. We found that a proportion of microcolonies, predominantly founded by mother cells with a short number of divisions, present reduced proliferation rates and increased levels of the cell cycle regulator Whi5. Our results indicate that stably reduced proliferation is not exclusively linked to aged cells and open a new perspective to understand heterogeneity of clonal cell populations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAtrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, increases thromboembolic stroke risk five-fold. Although atrial hypocontractility contributes to stroke risk in AF, the molecular mechanisms reducing myofilament contractile function remain unknown. We tested the hypothesis that increased expression of PPP1R12C, the PP1 regulatory subunit targeting atrial myosin light chain 2 (MLC2a), causes hypophosphorylation of MLC2a and results in atrial hypocontractility.\n\nMethodsRight atrial appendage tissues were isolated from human AF patients versus sinus rhythm (SR) controls. Western blots, co-immunoprecipitation, and phosphorylation studies were performed to examine how the PP1c-PPP1R12C interaction causes MLC2a de-phosphorylation. In vitro studies of pharmacologic MRCK inhibitor (BDP5290) in atrial HL-1 cells were performed to evaluate PP1 holoenzyme activity on MLC2a. Cardiac-specific lentiviral PPP1R12C overexpression was performed in mice to evaluate atrial remodeling with atrial cell shortening assays, echocardiography, and AF inducibility with EP studies.\n\nResultsIn human patients with AF, PPP1R12C expression was increased two-fold versus SR controls (P=2.0x10-2, n=12,12 in each group) with > 40% reduction in MLC2a phosphorylation (P=1.4x10-6, n=12,12 in each group). PPP1R12C-PP1c binding and PPP1R12C-MLC2a binding were significantly increased in AF (P=2.9x10-2 and 6.7x10-3 respectively, n=8,8 in each group). In vitro studies utilizing drug BDP5290, which inhibits T560-PPP1R12C phosphorylation, demonstrated increased PPP1R12C binding with both PP1c and MLC2a, and dephosphorylation of MLC2a. Lenti-12C mice demonstrated a 150% increase in LA size versus controls (P=5.0x10-6, n=12,8,12), with reduced atrial strain and atrial ejection fraction. Pacing-induced AF in Lenti-12C mice was significantly higher than controls (P=1.8x10-2 and 4.1x10-2 respectively, n= 6,6,5).\n\nConclusionsAF patients exhibit increased levels of PPP1R12C protein compared to controls. PPP1R12C overexpression in mice increases PP1c targeting to MLC2a and causes MLC2a dephosphorylation, which reduces atrial contractility and increases AF inducibility. These findings suggest that PP1 regulation of sarcomere function at MLC2a is a key determinant of atrial contractility in AF.",

    "abstract": "The RNA-binding protein TRIM71/LIN-41 is a phylogenetically conserved developmental regulator that functions in mammalian stem cell reprogramming, brain development and cancer. TRIM71 recognizes target mRNAs through hairpin motifs and silences them through molecular mechanisms that await identification. Here, we uncover that TRIM71 silences its targets by recruiting TNRC6/GW182, a core component of the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). Co-immunoprecipitation reveals interaction of TNRC6A with additional RNA-binding proteins and we demonstrate that AGO2, TRIM71, and UPF1 each recruit TNRC6 to specific, largely distinct sets of transcripts to silence them. As cellular TNRC6 levels are limiting, competition occurs among the silencing pathways, such that loss of AGO2 protein, or of AGO2 binding to TNRC6, enhances the activities of the other pathways. We conclude that a miRNA-like silencing activity is shared among different mRNA silencing pathways and that use of TNRC6 as a central hub provides a means to integrate their activities.",

How chromatin organization is duplicated on the two daughter strands is a central question in epigenetics. In mammals, transcription restarts on newly replicated DNA within a couple of hours, promoting chromatin accessibility. However, the role of transcription in the restoration of other chromatin determinants following DNA replication remains unclear. Here we have monitored protein re-association to newly replicated DNA upon inhibition of transcription using iPOND coupled to quantitative mass spectrometry. We show that nucleosome assembly and the re-establishment of most histone modifications are uncoupled from transcription restart. However, upon transcription inhibition, the re-association of many proteins was altered, including ATP-dependent remodellers, transcription regulators, the histone variant H2A.Z, histone modifiers as well as the restoration of H3.3K36me2. Finally, transcription also provoked the recruitment of several DNA repair proteins, revealing that transcription promotes chromatin reestablishment post-replication but is also a potential source of genotoxic stress.",

Instead, EoE patients exhibited a reduced pool of KRT15+ COL17A1+ quiescent cells, a modest increase in KI67+ dividing epibasal cells, a substantial increase in KRT13+ IVL+ suprabasal cells, and a loss of differentiated identity in superficial cells. Suprabasal and superficial cell populations demonstrated increased quiescent cell identity scoring in EoE with the enrichment of signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells. However, this was not paired with increased proliferation. Enrichment and trajectory analyses identified SOX2 and KLF5 as potential drivers of the increased quiescent identity and epithelial remodeling observed in EoE. Notably, these findings were not observed in GERD. Thus, our study demonstrates that BCH in EoE results from an expansion of non-proliferative cells that retain stem-like transcriptional programs while remaining committed to early differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Determining when DNA recovered from a crime scene transferred from its biological source, i.e., a samples  time-since-deposition (TSD), can provide critical context for biological evidence. Yet, there remains no analytical techniques for TSD that are validated for forensic casework. In this study, we investigate whether morphological and autofluorescence measurements of forensically-relevant cell populations generated with Imaging Flow Cytometry (IFC) can be used to predict the TSD of  touch or trace biological samples. To this end, three different prediction frameworks for estimating the number of day(s) for TSD were evaluated: the elastic net, gradient boosting machines (GBM), and generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) LASSO. Additionally, we transformed these continuous predictions into a series of binary classifiers to evaluate the potential utility for forensic casework. Results showed that GBM and GLMM-LASSO showed the highest accuracy, with mean absolute error estimates in a hold-out test set of 29 and 21 days, respectively. Binary classifiers for these models correctly binned 94-96% and 98-99% of the age estimates as over/under 7 or 180 days, respectively. This suggests that predicted TSD using IFC measurements coupled to one or, possibly, a combination binary classification decision rules, may provide probative information for trace biological samples encountered during forensic casework.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) regulate many important physiological processes in cells including antibiotic resistance and virulence genes through base pairing interactions with mRNAs. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) have great potential as therapeutics against bacterial pathogens by targeting sRNAs such as MicF, which regulates outer membrane protein OmpF expression and limits permeability of antibiotics. Here, we devise a cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) assay to identify ASO designs that sufficiently sequester MicF. ASOs were then ordered as peptide nucleic acids conjugated to cell-penetrating peptides (CPP-PNA) to allow for effective delivery into bacteria. Subsequent minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays demonstrated that simultaneously targeting the regions of MicF responsible for sequestering the start codon and the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of ompF with two different CPP-PNAs synergistically reduced the MIC for a set of antibiotics. This investigation offers a TX-TL based approach to identify novel therapeutic candidates to combat intrinsic sRNA-mediated antibiotic resistance mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "C. elegans is a free-living nematode that is widely used as a small animal model for studying fundamental biological processes and disease mechanisms. Since the discovery of the Orsay virus in 2011, C. elegans also holds the promise of dissecting virus-host interaction networks and innate antiviral immunity pathways in an intact animal. Orsay primarily targets the worm intestine, causing enlarged intestinal lumen as well as visible changes to infected cells such as liquefaction of cytoplasm and rearrangement of the terminal web. Previous studies of Orsay identified that C. elegans is able to mount antiviral responses by DRH-1/RIG-I mediated RNA interference and Intracellular Pathogen Response, a uridylyltransferase that destabilizes viral RNAs by 3' end uridylation, and ubiquitin protein modifications and turnover. To comprehensively search for novel antiviral pathways in C. elegans, we performed genome-wide RNAi screens by bacterial feeding using existing bacterial RNAi libraries covering 94% of the entire genome. Out of the 106 antiviral genes identified, we investigated those in three new pathways: collagens, actin remodelers, and epigenetic regulators. By characterizing Orsay infection in RNAi and mutant worms, our results indicate that collagens likely form a physical barrier in intestine cells to inhibit viral infection by preventing Orsay entry. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the intestinal actin (act-5), which is regulated by actin remodeling proteins (unc-34, wve-1 and wsp-1), a Rho GTPase (cdc-42) and chromatin remodelers (nurf-1 and isw-1), also provides antiviral immunity against Orsay possibly through another physical barrier presented as the terminal web.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression is regulated by transcription factors that work together to read cis-regulatory DNA sequences. The \"cis-regulatory code\" - the rules that cells use to determine when, where, and how much genes should be expressed - has proven to be exceedingly complex, but recent advances in the scale and resolution of functional genomics assays and Machine Learning have enabled significant progress towards deciphering this code. However, we will likely never solve the cis-regulatory code if we restrict ourselves to models trained only on genomic sequences; regions of homology can easily lead to overestimation of predictive performance, and there is insufficient sequence diversity in our genomes to learn all relevant parameters. Fortunately, randomly synthesized DNA sequences enable us to test a far larger sequence space than exists in our genomes in each experiment, and designed DNA sequences enable a targeted query of the sequence space to maximally improve the models. Since cells use the same biochemical principles to interpret DNA regardless of its source, models that are trained on these synthetic data can predict genomic activity, often better than genome-trained models. Here, we provide an outlook on the field, and propose a roadmap towards solving the cis-regulatory code by training models exclusively on non-genomic DNA sequences, and using genomic sequences solely for evaluating the resulting models.",

We demonstrate that single-molecule chromatin fiber sequencing can uniquely resolve chromatin organization within centromeres at single-molecule and single-nucleotide resolution. We find that the centromere core contains a dichotomous chromatin organization not found elsewhere in the genome, which is characterized by highly accessible chromatin patches heterogeneously punctuated amongst tightly compacted nucleosome arrays. These highly accessible chromatin patches correspond to sites of kinetochore attachment, and clustered CENP-B occupancy within these patches phase nucleosome arrays to the alpha-satellite repeat. This dichotomous chromatin organization is conserved among humans despite the marked divergence of the underlying alpha-satellite organization and is similarly conserved in gibbon centromeres that lack alpha-satellite repeats, indicating that functional conservation within centromeres is mediated at the level of chromatin, not DNA sequence.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDichotomous accessible and compacted chromatin (dichromatin) marks centromere cores\nC_LIO_LIHighly accessible chromatin patches punctuate sites of kinetochore attachment\nC_LIO_LIDichromatin can form irrespective of CENP-B occupancy\nC_LIO_LIConservation within centromeres is mediated at the level of chromatin, not DNA\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a key mediator of pyroptosis, a pro-inflammatory form of cell death occurring downstream of inflammasome activation as part of the innate immune defence. Upon cleavage by inflammatory caspases, the N-terminal domain of GSDMD forms pores in the plasma membrane resulting in cytokine release and eventually cell death. Targeting GSDMD is an attractive way to dampen inflammation. In this study, six GSDMD targeting nanobodies were characterized in terms of their binding affinity, stability, and effect on GSDMD pore formation. Three of the nanobodies inhibited GSDMD pore formation in a liposome leakage assay, although caspase cleavage was not perturbed. We determined the crystal structure of human GSDMD in complex with two nanobodies at 1.9 [A] resolution, providing detailed insights into the GSDMD-nanobody interactions and epitope binding. The pore formation is sterically blocked by one of the nanobodies that binds to the oligomerization interface of the N-terminal domain in the multi-subunit assembly. Our biochemical and structural findings provide new tools for studying inflammasome biology and build a framework for the design of novel GSDMD targeting drugs.",

    "abstract": "Enterococcus species have been described as core members of the microbial community of Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera:Noctuidae) and have been reported in previous studies as insecticide degrading agents. Phenotypic assays and comparative genomics analyses of several pesticide-degrading Enterococcus isolated from the larval gut of S. frugiperda led to the identification of Enterococcus entomosocium n. sp. and Enterococcus spodopteracolus n. sp. Their identities as new species were confirmed by whole genome alignment using the cut-offs of 95-96% for the average nucleotide identity (ANI) and 70% for the digital DNA:DNA hybridization (dDDH) values. The systematic positioning of these new species within the genus Enterococcus was resolved using genome-based analysis, placing Enterococcus casseliflavus as the sister group of E. entomosocium n. sp., and Enterococcus mundtii of E. spodopteracolus n. sp. Comparative genomic analyses of several isolates of E. entomosocium n. sp. and E. spodopteracolus n. sp. led to a better assessment of the interactions established in the symbiotic association with S. frugiperda, and the discovery of misidentified new species of Enterococcus associated with insects. Our analyses also indicated the potential of E. entomosocium n. sp. And E. spodopteracolus n. sp. to metabolize different pesticides arises from molecular mechanisms that result in the rapid evolution of new phenotypes in response to environmental stressors; in this case, the pesticides their host insect is exposed to.",
