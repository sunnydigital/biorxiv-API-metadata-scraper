    "abstract": "Noninvasive techniques to record and stimulate the brain rely on passing through the tissues in between the scalp and cortex. Currently, there is no method to obtain detailed information about these scalp-to-cortex distance (SCD) tissues. We introduce GetTissueThickness (GTT), an open-source, automated approach to quantify SCD, and unveil how tissue thicknesses differ across age groups, sexes and brain regions (n = 250). We show that men have larger SCD in lower scalp regions and women have similar-to-larger SCD in regions closer to the vertex, with aging resulting in increased SCD in fronto-central regions. Soft tissue thickness varies by sex and age, with thicker layers and greater age-related decreases in men. Compact and spongy bone thickness also differ across sexes and age groups, with thicker compact bone in women in both age groups and an age-related thickening. Older men generally have the thickest cerebrospinal fluid layer and younger women and men having similar cerebrospinal fluid layers. Aging mostly results in grey matter thinning. Concerning SCD, the whole isnt greater than the sum of its parts. GTT enables rapid quantification of the SCD tissues. The distinctive sensitivity of noninvasive recording and stimulation modalities to different tissues underscores the relevance of GTT.",

    "abstract": "Persistent sodium current (INaP) in the spinal locomotor network promotes two distinct nonlinear firing patterns: a self-sustained spiking triggered by a brief excitation in bistable motoneurons and bursting oscillations in interneurons of the central pattern generator (CPG). Here, we identified the NaV channels responsible for INaP and their role in motor behaviors. We report the axonal Nav1.6 as the main molecular player for INaP in lumbar motoneurons. The motoneuronal inhibition of Nav1.6, but not of Nav1.1, impairs INaP, bistability, postural tone and locomotor performance. In interneurons of the CPG region, Nav1.6 with Nav1.1 equally mediate INaP and the inhibition of both channels is required to abolish oscillatory bursting activities and the locomotor rhythm. Overall, Nav1.6 plays a significant role both in posture and locomotion by governing INaP-dependent bistability in motoneurons and working in tandem with Nav1.1 to provide INaP-dependent rhythmogenic properties of the CPG.",

Here, we report the derivation of trophoblast stem cells (ESTS) from the mESCs. The single-cell transcriptome and molecular characterization of ESTS show similarity with TSCs. They efficiently integrate into the TE compartment of the blastocyst and contribute to the placenta during development. We discovered GSK3{beta} as a critical regulator of the TE fate of ESCs. It plays a vital stage-specific role during ESTS derivation. We further show {beta}-CATENIN and an intron-I regulatory element of Cdx2 are essential for the TE fate of ESCs. We further show that the mouse epiblast can readily differentiate into TE lineage. In contrast to the paradigm of the restricted potential of pluripotent ESCs and epiblast, our data shows that murine ESCs and epiblast have the unrestrained developmental potential for extraembryonic lineages.",

    "abstract": "Maternal-offspring interactions in mammals are mainly characterised by cooperation, but also conflict. Over evolutionary time, the fetus has evolved to manipulate the mothers physiology to increase nutrient transfer through the placenta, but these mechanisms are poorly characterized. The imprinted Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) gene is highly expressed in mouse placental cells with endocrine functions. Here, we show that in the mouse, deletion of Igf2 in these cells leads to impaired placental endocrine signalling to the mother, but remarkably does not result in changes in placental morphology, growth or size. Mechanistically, we find that Igf2 via defective production of hormones, including prolactins, is essential for the establishment of the insulin-resistance state during pregnancy, and the appropriate partitioning of nutrients to the developing fetus. Consequently, fetuses are growth restricted and hypoglycemic, due to impaired placental glucose transfer from the mother to the fetus. Furthermore, Igf2 loss from placental endocrine cells has long-lasting effects on offspring adiposity and glucose homeostasis in adult life. Our study provides long-sought compelling experimental evidence for an intrinsic fetal manipulation system, which operates in the placenta to modify maternal metabolism and resource allocation to the fetus, with consequences for offspring metabolic health in later life.",

The mechanism by which this blunted response to hypoxia occurs is unknown. We have previously shown that a computational model (Diekman et al., 2017, J. Neurophysiol) of the respiratory neural network can be used to test hypotheses focused on changes in chemosensory inputs to the central pattern generator (CPG). We hypothesize that altered chemosensory function at the level of the carotid bodies and/or the nucleus tractus solitarii are responsible for the blunted response to hypoxia. Here, we use our model to explore this hypothesis by altering the properties of the gain function representing oxygen sensing inputs to the CPG. We then vary other parameters in the model and show that oxygen carrying capacity is the most salient factor for producing silent hypoxemia. We call for clinicians to measure hematocrit as a clinical index of altered physiology in response to COVID-19 infection.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial chromosome segregation is facilitated by the ParABS system. The ParB protein binds centromere-like parS sequences and forms nucleoprotein complexes. These nucleoprotein complexes are segregated by the dynamic ATPase ParA. In mycobacteria, ParA also interacts with the polar growth determinant DivIVA (Wag31). This interaction was earlier shown to facilitate the segregation of ParB complexes but also to affect cell extension. Here, we identify an additional partner of ParA in Mycobacterium smegmatis, named PapM. Using E. coli based analysis, we show that PapM likewise interacts with DivIVA and that the tripartite interaction of ParA-PapM-DivIVA is phosphorylation-dependent: ParA binding to DivIVA is diminished, while PapM binding is promoted upon phosphorylation of DivIVA. The presence of PapM enhances the dissociation of ParA from the DivIVA complex upon its phosphorylation. Studies of M. smegmatis mutant strains reveal that altered PapM levels influence chromosome segregation and cell length. The elimination of PapM affects ParA dynamics. Further, ParA and, to a lesser extent, PapM modulates the subcellular distribution of DivIVA. Altogether our studies show that the tripartite interplay between ParA-DivIVA and PapM controls the switch between cell division and cell elongation and in this way affects the mycobacterial cell cycle.\n\nImportanceThe genus of Mycobacteria includes important clinical pathogens (M. tuberculosis). Bacteria of this genus share the unusual features of their cell cycle such as asymmetric polar cell elongation and long generation time. Markedly, control of the mycobacterial cell cycle still remains not fully understood. The main cell growth determinant in Mycobacteria is an essential protein DivIVA, which is also involved in cell division. DivIVA activity is controlled by phosphorylation but the mechanism and significance of this process is unknown. Here, we show how the previously established protein interaction partner of DivIVA in Mycobacteria, the segregation protein ParA, affects the DivIVA subcellular distribution. We also demonstrate the role of a newly identified M. smegmatis DivIVA and ParA interaction partner, a protein named PapM, and we establish how their interactions are modulated by phosphorylation. Demonstrating that the tripartite interplay affects the mycobacterial cell cycle contributes to general understanding of mycobacterial growth regulation.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of Omicron lineages and descendent subvariants continues to present a severe threat to the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. We have previously suggested that an insufficient mucosal IgA response induced by the mRNA vaccines is associated with a surge in breakthrough infections. Here, we further show that the intramuscular mRNA and/or inactivated vaccines cannot sufficiently boost the mucosal sIgA response in uninfected individuals, particularly against the Omicron variant. We thus engineered and characterized recombinant monomeric, dimeric and secretory IgA1 antibodies derived from four neutralizing IgG monoclonal antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein (01A05, rmAb23, DXP-604 and XG014). Compared to their parental IgG antibodies, dimeric and secretory IgA1 antibodies showed a higher neutralizing activity against different variants of concern (VOCs), in part due to an increased avidity. Importantly, the dimeric or secretory IgA1 form of the DXP-604 antibody significantly outperformed its parental IgG antibody, and neutralized the Omicron lineages BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/5 with a 50-150-fold increase in potency, reaching the level of the most potent monoclonal antibodies described till date. In hACE2 transgenic mice, a single intranasal dose of the dimeric IgA DXP-604 conferred prophylactic and therapeutic protection against Omicron BA.5. Conversion of IgA and dimerization further enhanced or restored the neutralizing ability against the emerging Omicron sub-variants (DXP-604 for BQ.1, BQ.1.1 and BA2.75; 01A05 for BA2.75, BA.2.75.2 and XBB.1). Thus, dimeric or secretory IgA delivered by nasal administration may potentially be exploited for the treatment and prevention of Omicron infection, thereby providing an alternative tool for combating immune evasion by subvariants and, potentially, future VOCs.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryEngineered dimeric and secretory IgA1 neutralized Omicron variant with higher potency than parental IgG.",

    "abstract": "Fungal pathogens like Candida albicans can cause devastating human disease. Treatment of candidemia is complicated by the high rate of resistance to common antifungal therapies. Additionally, there is host toxicity associated with many antifungal compounds due to the conservation between essential mammalian and fungal proteins. An attractive new approach for antimicrobial development is to target virulence factors: non-essential processes that are required for the organism to cause disease in human hosts. This approach expands the potential target space while reducing the selective pressure towards resistance, as these targets are not essential for viability. In C. albicans, a key virulence factor is the ability to transition to hyphal morphology. We developed a high-throughput image analysis pipeline to distinguish between yeast and filamentous growth in C. albicans at the single cell level. Based on this phenotypic assay, we screened the FDA drug repurposing library of 2,017 compounds for their ability to inhibit filamentation and identified 33 compounds that block the hyphal transition in C. albicans with IC50 values ranging from 0.2 to 150 {micro}M. Multiple compounds showed a phenyl vinyl sulfone chemotype, prompting further analysis. Of these phenyl vinyl sulfones, NSC 697923 displayed the most efficacy, and by selecting for resistant mutants, we identified eIF3 as the target of NSC 697923 in C. albicans.",

    "abstract": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has restricted cell tropism. Apart from the Beaudette strain, other IBVs cannot infect mammalian cell lines. The limited cell tropism of other IBVs has hindered the development of IBV vaccines and research on mechanisms of IBV infection. In a previous study, a new Vero-cell-adapted strain HV80 was obtained via serial chicken embryo and cell passaging of strain H120 and 17 mutations leading to amino acid substitutions occurred in replication gene 1a, S gene and E gene. This study, we constructed recombinants that expressed chimeric S glycoprotein, S1 or S2 subunit of strain H120, and demonstrated that mutations in S2 subunit were related to the Vero cell adaption of strain HV80. With a genome backbone of strain HV80 or H120, and expression of chimeric S2' cleavage site of H120 or HV80, two recombinants demonstrated that the RRRR690/S motif at the S2' cleavage site played a key role in Vero cell adaption of strain HV80. Another six amino acid substitutions in the S2 subunit of the recombinants showed that F692V enhanced the capability of invasion of HV80 strain, and Q855H induced the formation of syncytia. A transient transfection assay demonstrated different mechanisms for virus-to-cell fusion and cell-to-cell fusion induced by S glycoprotein. The PRRR690/S motif at the S2' cleavage site could be activated by proteases in the process of cell-to-cell fusion, while H855Q substitution did not affect the cell invasion of HV80, but hindered the cell-to-cell fusion by blocking activation of the S2' cleavage site.\n\nIMPORTANCEInfectious bronchitis is an acute respiratory disease that has caused large economic losses to the poultry industry. As a member of the gamma-coronaviruses, the restricted cell tropism of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) limits the development of cellular vaccines and research on infection mechanisms. As a strain that can replicate effectively in mammalian cell lines, studies of HV80s adaptive mechanisms point a way for engineering other IBVs for adaptation in mammalian cell lines. In our study, different recombinants were constructed by reverse genetic techniques, and demonstrated the different mechanism between virus-to-cell and cell-to-cell fusion induced by HV80 S glycoprotein. The acquisition of a highly efficient S2' cleavage site enabled the virus to invade Vero cells. The Q855H substitution played a key role in cell-to-cell fusion, and provided a more efficient model of infection in Vero cells. Our study provides new theoretical insights into mechanisms of IBV adaptation in mammalian cell lines.",

    "abstract": "Monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection in humans are historically restricted to endemic regions in Africa. However, in 2022, an alarming number of MPXV cases have been reported globally with evidence of person-to-person transmission. Because of this, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the MPXV outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. MPXV vaccines are limited and only two antivirals, tecovirimat and brincidofovir, approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of smallpox, are currently available for the treatment of MPXV infection. Here, we evaluated 19 compounds previously shown to inhibit different RNA viruses for their ability to inhibit Orthopoxvirus infections. We first used recombinant vaccinia virus (rVACV) expressing fluorescence (Scarlet or GFP) and luciferase (Nluc) reporter genes to identify compounds with anti-Orthopoxvirus activity. Seven compounds from the ReFRAME library (antimycin A, mycophenolic acid, AVN- 944, pyrazofurin, mycophenolate mofetil, azaribine, and brequinar) and six compounds from the NPC library (buparvaquone, valinomycin, narasin, monensin, rotenone, and mubritinib) showed antiviral activity against rVACV. Notably, the anti-VACV activity of some of the compounds in the ReFRAME library (antimycin A, mycophenolic acid, AVN- 944, mycophenolate mofetil, and brequinar) and all the compounds from the NPC library (buparvaquone, valinomycin, narasin, monensin, rotenone, and mubritinib) were confirmed with MPXV, demonstrating the broad-spectrum antiviral activity against Orthopoxviruses and their potential to be used for the antiviral treatment of MPXV, or other Orthopoxvirus, infections.\n\nIMPORTANCEDespite the eradication of smallpox, some Orthopoxviruses remain important human pathogens, as exemplified by the recent 2022 monkeypox virus (MPXV) outbreak. Although smallpox vaccines are effective against MPXV, there is presently limited access to those vaccines. In addition, current antiviral treatment against MPXV infections is limited to the use of the FDA-approved drugs tecovirimat and brincidofovir. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify novel antivirals for the treatment of MPXV, and other potentially zoonotic Orthopoxvirus infections. Here, we show that thirteen compounds, derived from two different libraries, previously found to inhibit several RNA viruses, exhibit also antiviral activity against VACV. Notably, eleven compounds also displayed antiviral activity against MPXV, demonstrating their potential to be incorporated into the therapeutic armamentarium to combat Orthopoxvirus infections.",

    "abstract": "Microbial biogeochemical cycling relies on alternative electron acceptors when oxygen is unavailable, yet the role of viruses (bacteriophages) in these processes is understudied. We investigated how seasonal anoxia impacts viral and microbial biogeochemical cycling, by using paired total metagenomes, viromes, and metatranscriptomes, that were collected weekly. Stratification and anoxia drove microbial community composition, but dataset origin impacted the interpretation of viral community structure, activity, and function. Importantly, taxa abundance did not correlate with activity for both microbes and viruses. We identified virus-host linkages for 116 phages across 55 distinct hosts, many of which expressed genes for aerobic methane oxidation, nitrogen fixation, denitrification, and sulfate reduction. Overall, this work demonstrates the breadth and dynamics of virus-host interactions in mediating biogeochemistry. Additionally, we propose that viral community detection, functional potential, and activity are sensitive to pre-sequencing decisions, which must be kept in mind when interpreting genomic data in a biologically meaningful way.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to elucidate the effectiveness of soft debridement in cleaning wounds varying in size and type of exudate and in creating/maintaining a window of opportunity for the wound to be able to heal.\n\nApproachIn vitro comparison of cleaning characteristics (fluid holding capacity, cleaning efficacy/capacity) and biofilm removal efficacy of three different debridement pads of wounds varying in size and composition and viscosity of exudate.\n\nResultsAll three debridement pads tested showed the ability to clean small to large wounds with different types of exudate (serous/fibrinous) as well as to remove biofilm cells to some extent. Long and dense fibres are favourable when it comes to taking up and holding onto exudate while shorter fibres help to break open harder to clean wounds.\n\nInnovationThis study presents a standardised comparison of three different debridement pads based on the defined composition of exudate and standardised cleaning protocol followed by an robotic cleaning arm. This way, the influence of the type of fibre and overall composition of the pad can be compared in a scientific manner.\n\nConclusionA balance between fluid holding capacity and cleaning efficacy/capacity is important in order to achieve the best overall results and successfully remove exudate as well as biofilm cells from small to large wounds with different types of exudate. This in turn has a potential influence on the microenvironment of the wound.",

    "abstract": "The bark is the outermost defense of trees against microbial attack, largely thanks to toxicity and prevalence of extractive compounds. Nevertheless, bark decomposes in nature, though by which species and mechanisms remains unknown. Here, we have followed the development of microbial enrichments growing on spruce bark over six months, by monitoring both chemical changes in the material and performing community and metagenomic analyses. Carbohydrate metabolism was unexpectedly limited, and instead a key activity was metabolism of extractives. Resin acid degradation was principally linked to community diversification with specific bacteria revealed to dominate the process. Metagenome-guided isolation facilitated the recovery of the dominant enrichment strain in pure culture, which represents a new species (Pseudomonas abieticivorans sp. nov.), that can grow on resin acids as a sole carbon source. Our results illuminate key stages in degradation of an abundant renewable resource, and how defensive extractive compounds have major roles in shaping microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 has claimed millions of lives since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, and lung disease appears the primary cause of the death in COVID-19 patients. However, the underlying mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis remain elusive, and there is no existing model where the human disease can be faithfully recapitulated and conditions for the infection process can be experimentally controlled. Herein we report the establishment of an ex vivo human precision-cut lung slice (hPCLS) platform for studying SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and innate immune responses, and for evaluating the efficacy of antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2. We show that while SARS-CoV-2 continued to replicate during the course of infection of hPCLS, infectious virus production peaked within 2 days, and rapidly declined thereafter. Although most proinflammatory cytokines examined were induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, the degree of induction and types of cytokines varied significantly among hPCLS from individual donors, reflecting the heterogeneity of human populations. In particular, two cytokines (IP-10 and IL-8) were highly and consistently induced, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Histopathological examination revealed focal cytopathic effects late in the infection. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses identified molecular signatures and cellular pathways that are largely consistent with the progression of COVID-19 in patients. Furthermore, we show that homoharringtonine, a natural plant alkaloid derived from Cephalotoxus fortunei, not only inhibited virus replication but also production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and ameliorated the histopathological changes of the lungs caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, demonstrating the usefulness of the hPCLS platform for evaluating antiviral drugs.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEHere we established an ex vivo human precision-cut lung slice platform for assessing SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral replication kinetics, innate immune response, disease progression, and antiviral drugs. Using this platform, we identified early induction of specific cytokines, especially IP-10 and IL-8, as potential predictors for severe COVID-19, and uncovered a hitherto unrecognized phenomenon that while infectious virus disappears at late times of infection, viral RNA persists and lung histopathology commences. This finding may have important clinical implications for both acute and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. This platform recapitulates some of the characteristics of lung disease observed in severe COVID-19 patients and is therefore a useful platform for understanding mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and for evaluating the efficacy of antiviral drugs.",

These CCs also contain a common set of eight proteins that have no apparent direct catalytic function, including six that have an OB-fold domain. We show here that one of these OB-fold proteins, KREPA3 (A3), has structural homology to other editing proteins, is essential for editing and is multifunctional. We investigated A3 function by analyzing the effects of single amino acid loss of function mutations most of which were identified by screening bloodstream form (BF) parasites for loss of growth following random mutagenesis. Mutations in the ZFs, an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and several within or near the C-terminal OB-fold domain variably impacted CC structural integrity and editing. Some mutations resulted in almost complete loss of CCs and its proteins and editing whereas others retained CCs but had aberrant editing. All but a mutation which is near the OB-fold affected growth and editing in BF but not procyclic form (PF) parasites. These data indicate that multiple positions within A3 have essential functions that contribute to the structural integrity of CCs, the precision of editing and the developmental differences in editing between BF and PF stages.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between melatonin and m6A during pregnancy and elaborate the underlying protective mechanism of melatonin during pregnancy. In vitro, melatonin was found to alleviated LPS-induced reductions in the number of implantation sites. Besides, melatonin was found to alleviate the activation of inflammation, autophagy and apoptosis pathways. In vitro studies demonstrated that melatonin regulated several downstream pathways in an m6A-dependent manner via melatonin receptor MTNR1B. Our findings revealed the important roles of m6A in the establishment of pregnancy and discovered a new mechanism of how melatonin protects pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundG protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) signalling is implicated in skin-related and cardiovascular diseases, migraine and cancer. However, beyond its agonists and receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs), proteins which bind to CLR and define its properties in primary human cells remain insufficiently understood.\n\nAimWe aimed to profile the CLR interactome in primary human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLEC), where this GPCR is expressed.\n\nMaterials and methodsImmunoprecipitation (IP) of core- and terminally-glycosylated CLR from primary in vitro cultured HDLEC was conducted using rabbit polyclonal anti-human CLR serum (with pre- immune serum serving as a control) and confirmed by immunoblotting. Total HDLEC and co-immunoprecipitated CLR proteomes were analysed by label-free quantitative nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS). Quantitative in-situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) using ZEISS LSM 710 confocal microscope and ZEN Blue 3.0 and Image J software was performed to confirm nLC-MS/MS findings. All experiments were repeated at least three times (biological replicates). For statistical analysis of PLA data, distribution was analysed using Shapiro-Wilk normality test followed by an unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney test with a p-value of [&le;]0.05 interpreted as significant. For MS data of CLR IP samples, statistical analysis was performed using t-test with a permutation-based false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value of [&le;]0.006 interpreted as significant.\n\nResultsA total of 4,902 proteins were identified and quantified by nLC-MS/MS in primary HDLEC and 46 were co-immunoprecipitated with CLR (p<0.006). Direct interaction with the GPCR was confirmed for five of these by PLA (p<0.01).\n\nConclusionsThis is the first study of its kind to identify novel binding partners of CLR expressed in primary human cells. Our integrative quantitative approach, combining immunoprecipitation of core- and terminally-glycosylated CLR, nLC-MS/MS, and PLA, could be applied in a similar fashion to study its interactome in a variety of human cells and tissues, and its contribution to a range of diseases, where the role of this GPCR is implicated.",

In this study, we investigated spatial distribution of Olfr78, one of the SCFA receptors, in the mouse intestine and studied the transcriptome of colon enteroendocrine cells expressing Olfr78. The receptor is principally detected in the enterochromaffin and L subtypes in the proximal and distal colon, respectively. Using the Olfr78-GFP and VilCre/Olfr78flox transgenic mouse lines, we reveal that loss of epithelial Olfr78 results in impaired enterochromaffin cell differentiation, blocking cells in an undefined secretory lineage state. This is accompanied by dysbiosis, characterized by an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, as well as a less efficient antioxidant system in colon crypts. Using organoid cultures, we further show that maintenance of enterochromaffin cells involves activation of the Olfr78 receptor via the SCFA ligand acetate. Altogether, this work provides evidence that Olfr78 contributes to colon homeostasis by regulating enterochromaffin cell differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The importance of hybridization in morphological diversification is a fundamental topic in evolutionary biology. However, despite accumulated knowledge concerning adult hybrid variations, how hybridization affects ontogenetic allometry is less well understood. Herein, we assessed the effects of hybridization on the postnatal ontogenetic allometry in skulls of a putative hybrid population of introduced Taiwanese macaques (Macaca cyclopis) and native Japanese macaques (M. fuscata). Genomic analyses indicated that the population consisted of individuals with various degrees of admixture, formed by male migration of Japanese to Taiwanese macaques. Hybridization parallelly shifted the ontogenetic trajectories of the overall skull shape in an almost additive manner. Transgressive variations in the overall skull shape were observed mainly in non-allometric components. Hybridization lifted the restriction found in Japanese macaques on the growth rate of the maxillary sinus (the hollow space in the face), producing hybrids with a mosaic pattern, i.e., the maxillary sinus is as large as that in Taiwanese macaques, although the overall skull shape is intermediate. Our findings suggest that the transgressive variations can be caused by prenatal shape modifications and the lifting of the genetic restriction on the regional growth rate, highlighting the complex genetic and ontogenetic bases underlying hybridization-induced morphological diversification.",

    "abstract": "Age is a major risk factor for lung disease. To understand the mechanisms underlying this association, we characterized the changing cellular, genomic, transcriptional, and epigenetic landscape of lung aging using bulk and single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) data. Our analysis revealed age-associated gene networks that reflected hallmarks of aging, including mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and cellular senescence. Cell type deconvolution revealed age-associated changes in the cellular composition of the lung: decreased alveolar epithelial cells and increased fibroblasts and endothelial cells. In the alveolar microenvironment, aging is characterized by decreased AT2B cells and reduced surfactant production, a finding that was validated by scRNAseq and IHC. We showed that a previously reported senescence signature, SenMayo, captures cells expressing canonical senescence markers. SenMayo signature also identified cell-type specific senescence-associated co-expression modules that have distinct molecular functions, including ECM regulation, cell signaling, and damage response pathways. Analysis of somatic mutations showed that burden was highest in lymphocytes and endothelial cells and was associated with high expression of senescence signature. Finally, aging and senescence gene expression modules were associated with differentially methylated regions, with inflammatory markers such as IL1B, IL6R, and TNF being significantly regulated with age. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying lung aging and may have implications for the development of interventions to prevent or treat age-related lung diseases.",

Furthermore, DeepCORE translates the attention values embedded in the neural network into interpretable information, including locations of putative regulatory elements and their correlations, which collectively implies COREs.

However, despite ever expanding datasets, few plat-forms for integration and exploration of this heterogeneous data exist. To this end, we present the BrainTACO (Brain Transcriptomic And Connectivity Data) resource, a selection of heterogeneous, and multi-scale neurobiological data spatially mapped onto a common, hierarchical reference space, combined via a holistic data integration scheme. To access BrainTACO, we extended BrainTrawler, a web-based visual ana-lytics framework for spatial neurobiological data, with comparative visualizations of multiple resources for gene expression dissection of brain networks with an unprecedented coverage. Using this platform, allows to straightforward explore and extract brain data for identifying potential genetic drivers of connectivity in both mice and humans that may contribute to the discovery of dysconnectivity phenotypes. Hence, BrainTACO reduces the need for time-consuming manual data aggregation often required for computational analyses in script based toolboxes, and supports neuroscientists by focusing on leveraging the data instead of preparing it.",

    "abstract": "Both first-generation C-out and newer C-in RAF inhibitors paradoxically activate BRAF kinase at subsaturating concentrations. Paradoxical activation by C-in inhibitors is linked to the formation of BRAF dimers, but why activation rather than inhibition occurs remains unclear. We used biophysical methods tracking BRAF conformation and dimerization combined with thermodynamic modeling to define the allosteric coupling mechanism underlying paradoxical activation. Allosteric coupling between C-in inhibitors and BRAF dimerization is both extremely strong and highly asymmetric, with the first inhibitor contributing the bulk of dimer promotion. This asymmetric allosteric coupling mechanism results in the induction of dimers in which only one protomer is inhibited while the other is activated. The type II class of RAF inhibitors currently in clinical trials are more asymmetrically coupled and possess greater activation potential than older type I inhibitors. 19F NMR data demonstrate that the BRAF dimer displays dynamic conformational asymmetry, with only a subset of protomers locked in the C-in state, explaining how the conformational effects of drug binding can efficiently drive BRAF dimerization and activation at substoichiometric concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive disease characterized by complex lung pathogenesis affecting approximately three million people worldwide. While the molecular and cellular details of the IPF mechanism is emerging, our current understanding is centered around the lung itself. On the other hand, many human diseases are the products of complex multi-organ interactions. Hence, we postulate that a dysfunctional crosstalk of the lung with other organs plays a causative role in the onset, progression and/or complications of IPF. In this study, we employed a generative computational approach to identify such inter-organ mechanism of IPF. The approach works as follows: 1) To find unexpected relatedness of IPF to other diseases of non-lung organs and to identify molecular features that define such relatedness, 2) To identify differentially expressed genes between the lung tissues of IPF vs. those of non-IPF pulmonary disease patients, 3) To detect ligand-receptor relationships across multiple organs and their upstream and downstream signaling pathways in 1) and 2), 4) To generate a map of the inter-organ IPF mechanism with the molecular and cellular resolution. This approach found unexpected molecular relatedness of IPF to neoplasm, diabetes, Alzheimers disease, obesity, atherosclerosis, and arteriosclerosis. Furthermore, as a potential mechanism underlying this relatedness, we uncovered a putative molecular crosstalk system across the lung and the liver. In this inter-organ system, a secreted protein, kininogen 1, from hepatocytes in the liver interacts with its receptor, bradykinin receptor B1 in the lung. This ligand-receptor interaction across the liver and the lung leads to the activation of calmodulin pathways in the lung, leading to the activation of interleukin 6 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 pathway across these organs. Furthermore, we retrospectively identified several pre-clinical and clinical evidence supporting this inter-organ mechanism of IPF. In conclusion, such feedforward and feedback system across the lung and the liver provides a unique opportunity for the development of the treatment and/or diagnosis of IPF. Furthermore, the result illustrates a generative computational framework for machine-mediated synthesis of mechanisms that facilitates and complements the traditional experimental approaches in biomedical sciences.",

Upregulation of utrophin (UTRN), a dystrophin paralogue, is a promising therapeutic avenue. Here, we present a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated strategy to increase utrophin expression by disrupting microRNA (miR) binding sites (BS). Using a Cas9/gRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex we disrupted several miR BS in DMD myoblasts and selected the Let-7c BS has crucial for UTRN repression. Interestingly, Cas9/gRNA indels were as efficient as the complete removal of Let-7c BS in upregulating UTRN expression, without any major off-targets. In three-dimensional human DMD cultures, Cas9/gRNA-mediated editing resulted in significant utrophin upregulation and functional improvements of calcium dysregulation and muscle contraction. Finally, Let-7c BS disruption in mdx animals by systemic rAAVs mediated delivery of Cas9 and gRNA resulted in utrophin upregulation and amelioration of the muscle histopathological phenotype. These findings provide the foundations for a universal (mutation-independent) gene editing therapeutic strategy for DMD.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryCRISPR-Cas9 has the potential to upregulate utrophin to treat all DMD patients.",

One such protein is a serum endonuclease secreted by macrophages and dendritic cells, Dnase1L3. Loss of Dnase1L3 causes pediatric-onset lupus in humans is Dnase1L3. Reduction in Dnase1L3 activity occurs in adult-onset human SLE. However, the amount of Dnase1L3 necessary to prevent lupus onset, if the impact is continuous or requires a threshold, and which phenotypes are most impacted by Dnase1L3 remain unknown. To reduce Dnase1L3 protein levels, we developed a genetic mouse model with reduced Dnase1L3 activity by deleting Dnase1L3 from macrophages (cKO). Serum Dnase1L3 levels were reduced 67%, though Dnase1 activity remained constant. Sera were collected weekly from cKO and littermate controls until 50 weeks of age. Homogeneous and peripheral anti-nuclear antibodies were detected by immunofluorescence, consistent with anti-dsDNA antibodies. Total IgM, total IgG, and anti-dsDNA antibody levels increased in cKO mice with increasing age. In contrast to global Dnase1L3-/- mice, anti-dsDNA antibodies were not elevated until 30 weeks of age. The cKO mice had minimal kidney pathology, except for deposition of immune complexes and C3. Based on these findings, we conclude that an intermediate reduction in serum Dnase1L3 causes mild lupus phenotypes. This suggest that macrophage-derived DnaselL3 is critical to limiting lupus.",

From a high-throughput chemical screen of the comprehensive drug repurposing library ReFRAME, here we report the identification of SM04690, a clinical stage inhibitor of CLK2, as a potent activator of YAP driven transcriptional activity in cells. CLK2 inhibition promotes alternative splicing of the Hippo pathway protein AMOTL2, producing an exon-skipped gene product that can no longer associate with membrane-bound proteins, resulting in decreased phosphorylation and membrane localization of YAP.

    "abstract": "Endothelial tip cells are essential for VEGF-induced angiogenesis, but underlying mechanisms are elusive. Endothelial-specific deletion of EVL, a member of the mammalian Ena/VASP protein family, reduced the expression of the tip cell marker protein endothelial cell specific molecule-1 (Esm1) and compromised the radial sprouting of the vascular plexus in the postnatal mouse retina. The latter effects could at least partly be attributed to reduced VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) internalization and signaling but the underlying mechanisms(s) are not fully understood. In the present study, we revealed that the expression of the long non-coding RNA H19 was significantly reduced in endothelial cells from postnatal EVL-/- mice and in siRNA-transfected human endothelial cells under hypoxic conditions. H19 was recently shown to promote VEGF expression and bioavailability via Esm1 and hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Similar to EVL-/- mice, the radial outgrowth of the vascular plexus was significantly delayed in the postnatal retina of H19-/- mice. In summary, our data suggests that loss of EVL not only impairs VEGFR2 internalization and downstream signaling, but also impairs VEGF expression and bioavailability in the hypoxic retina via downregulation of lncRNA H19.",

Nef is recruited to CME sites on the plasma membrane, and this recruitment correlates with an increase in the recruitment and lifetime of CME coat protein AP-2 and late-arriving CME protein dynamin2. Furthermore, we find that CME sites that recruit Nef are more likely to recruit dynamin2, suggesting that Nef recruitment to CME sites promotes CME site maturation to ensure high efficiency in host protein downregulation.",

Furthermore, we sought client protein-specific pharmacological chaperones to restore the function of pathogenic receptors. Applications of positive allosteric modulators, including Hispidulin and TP003, increase the functional surface expression of the 1 variants. Mechanism of action study demonstrated that they enhance the folding and assembly and reduce the degradation of GABAA variants without activating the unfolded protein response in HEK293T cells and human iPSC-derived neurons.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe proliferation antigen Ki-67 has been widely used in clinical settings for cancer staging for many years but investigations on its biological functions have lagged. Recently, Ki-67 was shown to regulate both the composition of the chromosome periphery and chromosome behaviour in mitosis as well as to play a role in heterochromatin organisation and gene transcription. However, a role for Ki-67 in regulating cell cycle progression has never been reported. The progress towards understanding Ki-67 function have been limited by the tools available to deplete the protein coupled to its abundance and fluctuation during the cell cycle.\n\nResultsHere we have used an auxin-inducible degron tag (AID) to achieve a rapid and homogeneous degradation of Ki-67 in HCT116 cells. This system, coupled with APEX2 proteomics and phospho-proteomics approaches, allowed us to show for the first time that Ki-67 plays a role during DNA replication. In its absence, DNA replication is severely delayed, the replication machinery is unloaded, causing DNA damage that is not sensed by the canonical pathways and dependant on HUWE1 ligase. This leads to replication and sister chromatids cohesion defects, but it also triggers an interferon response mediated by the cGAS/STING pathway in all the cell lines tested.\n\nConclusionsWe have unveiled a new function of Ki-67 in DNA replication and genome maintenance that is independent of its previously known role in mitosis and gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Pattern forming networks have diverse roles in cell biology. Rod-shaped fission yeast cells use pattern formation to control the localization of mitotic signaling proteins and the cytokinetic ring. During interphase, the kinase Cdr2 forms membrane-bound multiprotein complexes termed nodes, which are positioned in the cell middle due in part to the node inhibitor Pom1 enriched at cell tips. Node positioning is important for timely cell cycle progression and positioning of the cytokinetic ring. Here, we combined experimental and modeling approaches to investigate pattern formation by the Pom1-Cdr2 system. We found that Cdr2 nodes accumulate near the nucleus, and Cdr2 undergoes nucleocytoplasmic shuttling when cortical anchoring is reduced. We generated particle-based simulations based on tip inhibition, nuclear positioning, and cortical anchoring. We tested model predictions by investigating Pom1-Cdr2 localization patterns after perturbing each positioning mechanism, including in both anucleate and multinucleated cells. Experiments show that tip inhibition and cortical anchoring alone are sufficient for the assembly and positioning of nodes in the absence of the nucleus, but that the nucleus and Pom1 facilitate the formation of unexpected node patterns in multinucleated cells. These findings have implications for spatial control of cytokinesis by nodes and for spatial patterning in other biological systems.",

    "abstract": "The organelles of eukaryotic cells maintain distinct protein and lipid compositions required for their specific functions. The mechanisms by which many of these components are sorted to their specific locations remain unknown. While some motifs mediating subcellular protein localization have been identified, many membrane proteins and most membrane lipids lack known sorting determinants. A putative mechanism for sorting of membrane components is based on membrane domains known as lipid rafts, which are laterally segregated nanoscopic assemblies of specific lipids and proteins. To assess the role of such domains in the secretory pathway, we applied a robust tool for synchronized secretory protein traffic (RUSH, Retention Using Selective Hooks) to protein constructs with defined affinity for raft phases. These constructs consist solely of single-pass transmembrane domains (TMDs) and, lacking other sorting determinants, constitute probes for membrane domain-mediated trafficking. We find that while raft affinity can be sufficient for steady-state PM localization, it is not sufficient for rapid exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is instead mediated by a short cytosolic peptide motif. In contrast, we find that Golgi exit kinetics are highly dependent on raft affinity, with raft preferring probes exiting Golgi [~]2.5-fold faster than probes with minimal raft affinity. We rationalize these observations with a kinetic model of secretory trafficking, wherein Golgi export can be facilitated by protein association with raft domains. These observations support a role for raft-like membrane domains in the secretory pathway and establish an experimental paradigm for dissecting its underlying machinery.",

    "abstract": "Excessive deposition of fibrillar collagen in the interstitial extracellular matrix (ECM) of human lung tissue causes fibrosis, which can ultimately lead to organ failure. Despite our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease, a cure for pulmonary fibrosis has not yet been found. In this study, we screened an FDA-approved drug library containing 712 drugs and found that Dextromethorphan (DXM), a cough expectorant, significantly reduces the amount of excess fibrillar collagen deposited in the ECM in in-vitro cultured primary human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) and ex-vivo cultured human precision-cut lung slice (hPCLS) models of lung fibrosis. Reduced extracellular fibrillar collagen levels in the ECM upon DXM treatment are due to a reversible trafficking inhibition of collagen type I (COL1) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in TANGO1 and HSP47 positive structures. Mass spectrometric analysis shows that DXM causes hyper-hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues on Collagen (COL1, COL3, COL4, COL5, COL7, COL12) and Latent-transforming growth factor beta-binding protein (LTBP1 and LTBP2) peptides coinciding with their secretion block. In addition, thermal proteome profiling of cells treated with DXM shows increased thermal stability of prolyl-hydroxylases such as P3H2, P3H3, P3H4, P4HA1 and P4HA2, suggesting a change in activity. Transcriptome analysis of pro-fibrotic stimulated NHLFs and hPCLS upon DXM treatment showed activation of an anti-fibrotic program via regulation of pathways such as those involved in the MMP-ADAMTS axis, WNT, and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation. Taken together, the data obtained from both in-vitro and ex-vivo models of fibrogenesis show that Dextromethorphan has potent anti-fibrotic activity by efficient inhibition of COL1 membrane trafficking in the ER.",

Here we investigated the consequences of the genetic deletion of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), which increases macrophage M1 polarization through augmented signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which attenuates inflammation by inhibiting STAT1 expression and signaling. While a basal activity of AMPK (phosphorylation on Thr172) was detected in macrophages from wild-type mice, AMPK phosphorylation was significantly reduced in VASP-deficient M1 macrophages in vitro and the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1{beta} was increased in these cells. Consistent with the role of AMPK in macrophage phagocytosis, VASP-/- macrophage phagocytosis was also significantly impaired. Interestingly, impaired phagocytosis could be rescued by exogenous activation of AMPK. Mechanistically, we found that VASP binds directly to protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 6 (PP1-R6) and we hypothesize that VASP-binding to PP1- R6/PP1 limits the PP1-dependent de-phosphorylation of AMPK in wild-type cells. Conversely, AMPK dephosphorylation by the PP1-R6/PP1 complex is enhanced in the absence of VASP. In summary, we have identified a link between VASP and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, which may contribute to the pro-inflammatory phenotype of VASP-deficient macrophages.",
