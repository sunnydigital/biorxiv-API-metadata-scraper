    "abstract": "Robust and reliable estimates of how individuals are biologically related to each other are a key source of information when reconstructing pedigrees. In combination with contextual data, reconstructed pedigrees can be used to infer possible kinship practices in prehistoric populations. However, standard methods to estimate biological relatedness from genome sequence data cannot be applied to low coverage sequence data, such as are common in ancient DNA (aDNA) studies. Critically, a statistically robust method for assessing and quantifying the confidence of a classification of a specific degree of relatedness for a pair of individuals, using low coverage genome data, is lacking.\n\nIn this paper we present the R-package BREADR (Biological RElatedness from Ancient DNA in R), which leverages the so-called pairwise mismatch rate, calculated on optimally-thinned genome-wide pseudo-haploid sequence data, to estimate genetic relatedness up to the second degree, assuming an underlying binomial distribution. BREADR also returns a posterior probability for each degree of relatedness, from identical twins/same individual, first-degree, second-degree or \"unrelated\" pairs, allowing researchers to quantify and report the uncertainty, even for particularly low-coverage data. We show that this method accurately recovers degrees of relatedness for sequence data with coverage as low as 0.04X using simulated data, and then compare the performance of BREADR on empirical data from Bronze Age Iberian human sequence data. The BREADR package is designed for pseudo-haploid genotype data, common in aDNA studies.",

    "abstract": "Low-complexity data analysis is the area that addresses the search and quantification of regions in sequences of elements that contain low-complexity or repetitive elements. For example, these can be tandem repeats, inverted repeats, homopolymer tails, GC biased regions, similar genes, and hairpins, among many others. Identifying these regions is crucial because of their association with regulatory and structural characteristics. Moreover, their identification provides positional and quantity information where standard assembly methodologies face significant difficulties because of substantial higher depth coverage (mountains), ambiguous read mapping, or where sequencing or reconstruction defects may occur. However, the capability to distinguish low-complexity regions (LCRs) in genomic and proteomic sequences is a challenge that depends on the models ability to find them automatically. Low-complexity patterns can be implicit through specific or combined sources, such as algorithmic or probabilistic, and recurring to different spatial distances, namely local, medium, or distant associations.This paper addresses the challenge of automatically modeling and distinguishing LCRs, providing a new method and tool (AlcoR) for efficient and accurate segmentation and visualization of these regions in genomic and proteomic sequences. The method enables the use of models with different memories, providing the ability to distinguish local from distant low-complexity patterns. The method is reference- and alignment-free, providing additional methodologies for testing, including a highly-flexible simulation method for generating biological sequences (DNA or protein) with different complexity levels, sequence masking, and a visualization tool for automatic computation of the LCR maps into an ideogram style. We provide illustrative demonstrations using synthetic, nearly synthetic, and natural sequences showing the high efficiency and accuracy of AlcoR. As large-scale results, we use AlcoR to unprecedentedly provide a whole-chromosome low-complexity map of a recent complete human genome and the haplotype-resolved chromosome pairs of a heterozygous diploid African cassava cultivar.The AlcoR method provides the ability of fast sequence characterization through data complexity analysis, ideally for scenarios entangling the presence of new or unknown sequences. AlcoR is implemented in C language using multi-threading to increase the computational speed, is flexible for multiple applications, and does not contain external dependencies. The tool accepts any sequence in FASTA format. The source code is freely provided at https://github.com/cobilab/alcor.",

    "abstract": "The \"Protein Abundances Across Organisms\" database (PaxDB) is an integrative meta-resource dedicated to protein abundance levels, in tissue-specific or whole-organism proteomes. PaxDB focuses on computing best-estimate abundances for proteins in normal/healthy contexts, and expresses abundance values for each protein in \"parts per million\" (ppm) in relation to all other protein molecules in the cell. The uniform data re-processing, quality scoring, and integrated orthology relations have made PaxDB one of the preferred tools for comparisons between individual datasets, tissues or organisms. In describing the latest version 5.0 of PaxDB, we particularly emphasise the data integration from various types of raw data, and how we expanded the number of organisms and tissue groups as well as the proteome coverage. The current collection of PaxDB includes 831 original datasets from 170 species, including 22 Archaea, 81 Bacteria and 67 Eukaryota. Apart from detailing the data update, we also show a comparative analysis of the human proteome subset of PaxDB against the two most widely-used human proteome data resources: Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx). Lastly, we present a use case of PaxDB, showing how protein abundance data can be used to study the evolution of relative amino acid usage in Fungi.",

    "abstract": "Aquaporins can facilitate the passive movement of water and small polar molecules and some ions. The barley Nodulin 26-like Intrinsic Protein (HvNIP2;1) embedded in liposomes and examined through stopped-flow light scattering spectrophotometry and Xenopus oocyte swelling assays was found to permeate water, boric and germanic acids, sucrose and L-arabinose but not D-glucose or D-fructose. Other saccharides, such as neutral (D-mannose, D-galactose, D-xylose, D-mannoheptaose) and charged (N-acetyl D-glucosamine, D-glucosamine, D-glucuronic acid) aldoses, disaccharides (lactose, cellobiose, gentiobiose, trehalose), trisaccharide raffinose, and urea, glycerol, and acyclic polyols were permeated to a much lower extent. Apparent permeation of hydrated KCl and MgSO4 ion pairs was observed, while CH3COONa and NaNO3 permeated at significantly lower rates. Experiments with boric acid and sucrose revealed no apparent interaction between solutes when permeated together, and AgNO3 blocked the permeation of all solutes. Full-scale steered molecular dynamics simulations of HvNIP2;1 and spinach SoPIP2;1 revealed possible rectification for water, boric acid, and sucrose transport, and defined key residues interacting with permeants. In a biological context, the simulated sucrose rectification could mediate its apoplastic-to-intracellular transport but not the reverse, thus, constituting a novel element of plant saccharide-transporting machinery. Phylogenomic analyses of 164 Viridiplantae and 2,993 Archaean, bacterial, fungal, and Metazoan aquaporins rationalised solute poly-selectivity in NIP3 sub-clade entries and suggested that they diversified from other sub-clades to acquire a unique specificity of saccharide transporters. Solute specificity definition in NIP aquaporins could inspire developing plants for sustained food production.\n\nSignificance StatementAquaporins are fundamental to water and solute movements in nearly all living organisms. Solute selectivity inspections of the HvNIP2;1 aquaporin revealed that it transported water, hydroxylated metalloids boric and germanic acids, sucrose, L-arabinose, KCl, and MgSO4 ion pairs, but not D-glucose or D-fructose and to lesser extent urea, and acyclic polyols. This poly-selective transport by HvNIP2;1 classified in the NIP3 sub-clade aquaporins may afford nutritional and protective roles during plant development and in response to abiotic stresses. It is anticipated that the solute specificity definition of HvNIP2;1 inspires protein engineering and in silico mining to develop plants, which when exposed to suboptimal soil conditions of high soil metalloids, would overcome toxicity for sustained food production.",

    "abstract": "Interactions among proteins in living cells can lead to molecular assemblies of different sizes and large-scale coexisting phases formed via phase separation. Both are essential for the spatial organization of cells and for regulating biological function and dysfunction. A key challenge is understanding the interplay between molecular assembly and phase separation. However, a corresponding theoretical framework that relies on thermodynamic principles is lacking. Here, we present a non-equilibrium thermodynamic theory for a multi-component mixture that contains assemblies of different sizes, which can form, dissolve, and phase-separate from the solvent. We show that the size distributions of assemblies differ between the phases and that the dense phase can gelate. Moreover, we unravel the mechanisms involved in growth and compositional changes of the coexisting phases during assembly kinetics. Our theory can explain how molecular assembly is intertwined with phase separation, and our results are consistent with recent experimental observations on protein phase separation.\n\nI. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMost biological functions and dysfunctions rely on two fundamental processes, molecular assembly and the formation of condensed phases such as biomolecular condensates. Condensed phases generally form via phase separation, while molecular assemblies are assemblies of molecules of various sizes, shapes, and functionality. We developed a theory that relies on thermodynamic principles to understand the interplay between molecular assembly and phase separation. We obtain results consistent with recent in vitro experimental observations of reconstituted proteins, including anomalous size distribution of assemblies and the gelation of condensed phases. Our theory provides the framework to unravel the mechanisms underlying physiological assemblies essential for cellular function, and aberrant assemblies that are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play important roles in cell-cell communication but they are highly heterogeneous, and each vesicle has dimensions smaller than 200 nm thus encapsulates very limited amounts of cargos. We report the technique of NanOstirBar (NOB)-EnabLed Single Particle Analysis (NOBEL-SPA) that utilizes NOBs, which are superparamagnetic nanorods easily handled by a magnet or a rotating magnetic field, to act as isolated \"islands\" for EV immobilization and cargo confinement. NOBEL-SPA permits rapid inspection of single EV with high confidence by confocal fluorescence microscopy, and can assess the colocalization of selected protein/microRNA (miRNA) pairs in the EVs produced by various cell lines or present in clinical sera samples. Specific EV sub-populations marked by the colocalization of unique protein and miRNA combinations have been revealed by the present work, which can differentiate the EVs by their cells or origin, as well as to detect early-stage breast cancer (BC). We believe NOBEL-SPA can be expanded to analyze the co-localization of other types of cargo molecules, and will be a powerful tool to study EV cargo loading and functions under different physiological conditions, and help discover distinct EV subgroups valuable in clinical examination and therapeutics development.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Most CRC patients present with a microsatellite stable (MSS) phenotype and are highly resistant to immunotherapies. Tumor extracellular vesicles (TEVs), secreted by tumor cells, can contribute to intrinsic resistance to immunotherapy in CRC. We previously showed that autologous TEVs without functional miR-424 induce anti-tumor immune responses. We hypothesized that allogeneic modified CRC-TEVs without miR-424 (mouse homolog miR-322) derived from an MC38 background would effectively stimulate CD8+ T cell response and limit CT26 tumor growth. Here we show that prophylactic administration of MC38 TEVs without functional miR-424 significantly increased CD8+ T cells in CT26 CRC tumors and limited tumor growth, not B16-F10 melanoma tumors. We further show that the depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells abolished the protective effects of MC38 TEVs without functional miR-424. We further show that TEVs can be taken up by DCs in vitro, and subsequent prophylactic administration of autologous DCs exposed to MC38 TEVs without functional miR-424 suppressed tumor growth and increased CD8+ T cells compared to MC38 wild-type TEVs exposed to DCs, in Balb/c mice bearing CT26 tumors. Notably, the modified EVs were well tolerated and did not increase cytokine expression in peripheral blood. These findings suggest that allogeneic-modified CRC-EVs without immune suppressive miR-424 can induce antitumor CD8+ T cell responses and limit tumor growth in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) tend to become highly invasive early during cancer development. Despite some successes in the initial treatment of patients diagnosed with early-stage localized TNBC, the rate of metastatic recurrence remains high with poor long-term survival outcomes. Here we show that elevated expression of the serine/threonine-kinase, Calcium/Calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase kinase-2 (CaMKK2), is highly correlated with tumor invasiveness. We determined that genetic disruption of CaMKK2 expression, or inhibition of its activity, disrupted spontaneous metastatic outgrowth from primary tumors in murine xenograft models of TNBC. High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), a high-risk, poor-prognosis ovarian cancer subtype, shares many genetic features with TNBC, and importantly, CaMKK2 inhibition effectively blocked metastatic progression in a validated xenograft model of this disease. Probing the mechanistic links between CaMKK2 and metastasis we defined the elements of a new signaling pathway that impacts actin cytoskeletal dynamics in a manner which increases cell migration/invasion and metastasis. Notably, CaMKK2 increases the expression of the phosphodiesterase PDE1A which decreases the cGMP-dependent activity of protein kinase G1 (PKG1). This inhibition of PKG1 results in decreased phosphorylation of Vasodilator-Stimulated Phosphoprotein (VASP), which in its hypophosphorylated state binds to and regulates F-actin assembly to facilitate contraction/cell movement. Together, these data establish a targetable CaMKK2-PDE1A-PKG1-VASP signaling pathway that controls cancer cell motility and metastasis. Further, it credentials CaMKK2 as a therapeutic target that can be exploited in the discovery of agents for use in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting to restrict tumor invasiveness in patients diagnosed with early-stage TNBC or localized HGSOC.",

    "abstract": "The liver is known for its remarkable regenerative ability through proliferation of hepatocytes. Yet, during chronic injury or severe hepatocyte death, proliferation of hepatocytes is exhausted. To overcome this hurdle, we propose vascular-endothelial-growth-factor A (VEGFA) as a therapeutic means to accelerate biliary epithelial cell (BEC)-to-hepatocyte conversion. Investigation in zebrafish establishes that blocking VEGF receptors abrogates BEC-driven liver repair, while VEGFA overexpression promotes it. Delivery of VEGFA via non-integrative and safe nucleoside-modified mRNA encapsulated into lipid-nanoparticles (mRNA-LNP) in acutely or chronically injured mouse livers induces robust BEC-to-hepatocyte conversion and reversion of steatosis and fibrosis. In human and murine diseased livers, we further identified VEGFA-receptor KDR-expressing BECs associated with KDR-expressing cell-derived hepatocytes. This defines KDR-expressing cells, most likely being BECs, as facultative progenitors. This study reveals novel therapeutic benefits of VEGFA delivered via nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP, whose safety is widely validated with COVID-19 vaccines, for harnessing BEC-driven repair to potentially treat liver diseases.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=156 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/537186v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (53K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8ce1bdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1385103org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4ec496org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14c9295_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIComplementary mouse and zebrafish models of liver injury demonstrate the therapeutic impact of VEGFA-KDR axis activation to harness BEC-driven liver regeneration.\nC_LIO_LIVEGFA mRNA LNPs restore two key features of the chronic liver disease in humans such as steatosis and fibrosis.\nC_LIO_LIIdentification in human cirrhotic ESLD livers of KDR-expressing BECs adjacent to clusters of KDR+ hepatocytes suggesting their BEC origin.\nC_LIO_LIKDR-expressing BECs may represent facultative adult progenitor cells, a unique BEC population that has yet been uncovered.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsAcetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure, with one available treatment, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Yet, NAC effectiveness diminishes about ten hours after APAP overdose, urging for therapeutic alternatives. This study addresses this need by deciphering a mechanism of sexual dimorphism in APAP-induced liver injury, and leveraging it to accelerate liver recovery via growth hormone (GH) treatment. GH secretory patterns, pulsatile in males and near-continuous in females, determine the sex bias in many liver metabolic functions. Here, we aim to establish GH as a novel therapy to treat APAP hepatotoxicity.\n\nApproach and ResultsOur results demonstrate sex-dependent APAP toxicity, with females showing reduced liver cell death and faster recovery than males. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses reveal that female hepatocytes have significantly greater levels of GH receptor expression and GH pathway activation compared to males. In harnessing this female-specific advantage, we demonstrate that a single injection of recombinant human GH protein accelerates liver recovery, promotes survival in males following sub-lethal dose of APAP, and is superior to standard-of-care NAC. Alternatively, slow-release delivery of human GH via the safe nonintegrative lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated nucleoside-modified mRNA (mRNA-LNP), a technology validated by widely used COVID-19 vaccines, rescues males from APAP-induced death that otherwise occurred in control mRNA-LNP-treated mice.\n\nConclusionsOur study demonstrates a sexually dimorphic liver repair advantage in females following APAP overdose, leveraged by establishing GH as an alternative treatment, delivered either as recombinant protein or mRNA-LNP, to potentially prevent liver failure and liver transplant in APAP-overdosed patients.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsThe constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) is a nuclear receptor able to recognize a large panel of xenobiotics leading to the modulation of the expression of its target genes involved in xenobiotic detoxication and energy metabolism. While CAR hepatic activity is thought to be higher in women than in men, its response to an acute pharmacological activation has never been investigated in both sexes.\n\nMethodsHepatic transcriptome, plasma and hepatic metabolome, have been analyzed in Car+/+ and Car-/- male and female mice treated either with the CAR-specific agonist, 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP), or with vehicle.\n\nResultsWhile 90% of TCPOBOP-sensitive genes were modulated in a sex- independent way, the remaining 10% were almost exclusively impacted in female liver specifically. These female-specific CAR-sensitive genes were mainly involved in xenobiotic metabolism, inflammation and extracellular matrix organization. CAR activation also induced higher hepatic oxidative stress and hepatocyte cytolysis in females than in males. Data mining on human data confirmed that CAR activation may be involved in sexually-dimorphic drug-induced liver injury. Hepatic expression of flavin monooxygenase 3 (Fmo3) was almost abolished and associated with a decrease of hepatic trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) concentration in TCPOBOP-treated females. In line with a possible role in the control of TMAO homeostasis, CAR activation decreased platelet hyperresponsiveness in female mice supplemented with dietary choline.\n\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate that more than 10% of CAR-sensitive genes are sex-specific and influence hepatic and systemic response such as platelet aggregation. Also, CAR activation may be an important mechanism of sexually- dimorphic drug-induced liver injury.",

    "abstract": "Starvation and refeeding are mostly unanticipated in the wild in terms of duration, frequency, and nutritional value of the refed state. Notwithstanding this, organisms mount efficient and reproducible responses to restore metabolic homeostasis. Hence, it is intuitive to invoke expectant molecular mechanisms that build anticipatory responses to enable physiological toggling during fed-fast cycles. In this regard, we report anticipatory biogenesis of oscillatory hepatic microRNAs, which were earlier shown to peak during a fed state to inhibit starvation-responsive genes. Results presented in this study clearly demonstrate that the levels of primary and precursor microRNA transcripts increase during a fasting state, in anticipation of a fed response. We delineate the importance of both metabolic inputs and circadian cues in orchestrating microRNA homeostasis in a physiological setting, using the most prominent hepatic fed-miRNAs as candidates. Besides illustrating the metabo-endocrine control, our findings provide a mechanistic basis for the overarching influence of starvation on anticipatory biogenesis. Importantly, by employing pharmacological agents that are widely used in the clinics, we point out the high potential of interventions to restore homeostasis of hepatic microRNAs, whose deregulated expression is otherwise well established to cause metabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMitochondrial calcium (mCa2+) uptake through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter channel (mtCU) stimulates metabolism to meet acute increases in cardiac energy demand. However, excessive mCa2+ uptake during stress, as in ischemia-reperfusion, initiates permeability transition and cell death. Despite these often-reported acute physiological and pathological effects, a major unresolved controversy is whether mtCU-dependent mCa2+ uptake and long-term elevation of cardiomyocyte mCa2+ contributes to the hearts adaptation during sustained increases in workload.\n\nObjectiveWe tested the hypothesis that mtCU-dependent mCa2+ uptake contributes to cardiac adaptation and ventricular remodeling during sustained catecholaminergic stress.\n\nMethodsMice with tamoxifen-inducible, cardiomyocyte-specific gain (MHC-MCM x flox-stop-MCU; MCU-Tg) or loss (MHC-MCM x Mcufl/fl; Mcu-cKO) of mtCU function received 2-wk catecholamine infusion.\n\nResultsCardiac contractility increased after 2d of isoproterenol in control, but not Mcu-cKO mice. Contractility declined and cardiac hypertrophy increased after 1-2-wk of isoproterenol in MCU-Tg mice. MCU-Tg cardiomyocytes displayed increased sensitivity to Ca2+- and isoproterenol-induced necrosis. However, loss of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) regulator cyclophilin D failed to attenuate contractile dysfunction and hypertrophic remodeling, and increased isoproterenol-induced cardiomyocyte death in MCU-Tg mice.\n\nConclusionsmtCU mCa2+ uptake is required for early contractile responses to adrenergic signaling, even those occurring over several days. Under sustained adrenergic load excessive MCU-dependent mCa2+ uptake drives cardiomyocyte dropout, perhaps independent of classical mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, and compromises contractile function. These findings suggest divergent consequences for acute versus sustained mCa2+ loading, and support distinct functional roles for the mPTP in settings of acute mCa2+ overload versus persistent mCa2+ stress.",

    "abstract": "Abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, and cold negatively affect plant growth and crop productivity. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying plant responses to these stressors is essential for stress tolerance in crops. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is significantly increased upon abiotic stressors, inducing physiological responses to adapt to stress and regulate gene expression. Although many studies have examined the components of established stress signaling pathways, few have explored other unknown elements. Data-driven studies have the advantage of analyzing large and independent datasets, which can lead to the identification of novel research topics. This study aimed to identify novel stress-responsive genes in plants by performing a meta-analysis of public RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data on Arabidopsis thaliana from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus, focusing on five ABA-related stress conditions (ABA, Salt, Dehydration, Osmotic, and Cold). The meta-analysis of 216 paired datasets from five stress conditions was conducted, and differentially expressed genes were identified by introducing a new metric, called TN (stress-treated (T) and non-treated (N))-score. Enrichment analysis was performed to characterize differentially expressed genes, and genes that were commonly regulated under different stresses were also identified. The meta-analysis revealed that 14 genes were commonly upregulated and 8 genes were commonly downregulated across all five treatments, including some that were not previously associated with these stress responses. On the other hand, some genes regulated by salt, dehydration, and osmotic treatments were not regulated by exogenous ABA or cold stress, suggesting that they may be involved in the plant response to dehydration independent of ABA. Meta-analysis revealed a list of candidate genes with unknown molecular mechanisms in ABA-dependent and ABA-independent stress responses. The identified genes could be valuable resources for selecting genome editing targets and potentially contribute to the discovery of novel stress tolerance mechanisms and pathways in plants.",

    "abstract": "Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is a primarily short-day crop grown for grain, fiber, and secondary metabolites. Although terminal flowering of most non-domesticated hemp is regarded as photoperiod sensitive, limited germplasm is available for the development of day-neutral hemp. Day-neutral plants experience flower maturation independently of the short-day photoperiod cue which is typically triggered by photoperiods of less than 14 hours. The day-neutral trait is the subject of increased commercial interest for the purpose of breeding varieties with accelerated flowering time or cultivars that do not require labor- and cost-intensive light deprivation production systems. Genetic markers for the photoperiodic response would help breeders make early selection in the design of suitable cultivars for specific environments and cultivation calendars. Limited refereed information has been produced regarding the genetic regulation of photoperiodism in C. sativa. A population of 318 F2 individuals segregating for day-neutral flowering was developed, phenotyped, and genotyped. Genome-wide association analysis identified markers associated with the day-neutral trait indicating that a single recessive gene controlling photoperiod sensitivity is located within a large region of Chromosome 1. Flanking region sequence data of linked SNP markers was used in the development and validation of a TaqMan-based qPCR assay for the day-neutral trait. A genetic linkage map was produced, and QTL mapping identified two additional markers on Chromosome 1. Candidate genes, TARGET OF EARLY ACTIVATION TAGGED (TOE)/APETALA2 (AP2), and PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 3 (PRR3), may work together to impact phase transition and photoperiodic flowering respectively and have key domains that are disrupted in day-neutral plants.\n\nThe day-neutral flowering (a.k.a. \"autoflower\") phenotype is a valuable and understudied trait in Cannabis sativa\n\nThe phenotype may result from a conserved linkage block of phase transition and photoperiodic flowering genes\n\nA segregating population was developed, genome wide analyses identified markers linked to the day-neutral trait\n\nCorrelated markers were mapped to Chromosome 1 across a sizable region that appears to be largely non-recombining",

    "abstract": "Phosphorylation of AHL10, one of the AT-hook family of plant-specific DNA binding proteins, is critical for growth suppression during moderate severity drought (low water potential, {psi}w) stress. To understand how AHL10 phosphorylation determines drought response, we identified putative AHL10 interacting proteins and further characterized interaction with RRP6L1, a protein involved in epigenetic regulation. RRP6L1 and AHL10 mutants, as well as ahl10-1rrp6l1-2, had similar phenotype of increased growth maintenance during low {psi}w. Chromatin precipitation demonstrated that RRP6L1 chromatin association increased during low {psi}w stress and was dependent upon AHL10 phosphorylation. Transcriptome analyses showed that AHL10 and RRP6L1 have concordant effects on expression of stress- and development-related genes. Together these results indicate that stress signaling can act via AHL10 phosphorylation to control the chromatin association of the key regulatory protein RRP6L1. AHL10 and RRP6L1 interaction in meristem cells is part of a mechanism to down-regulate growth during low {psi}w stress. Interestingly, loss of AHL13, which is homologous to AHL10 and phosphorylated at similar C-terminal site, blocked the enhanced growth maintenance of ahl10-1. Thus, AHL10 and AHL13, despite their close homology, are not redundant but rather have distinct roles, likely related to the formation of AHL hetero-complexes.\n\nSummary StatementPhosphorylation of Arabidopsis thaliana AHL10 is important to control growth during drought stress, a function which is distinct from the closely related AHL13. One way that phosphorylation determines AHL10 function is by altering its ability to mediate chromatin recruitment of RRP6L1.",

    "abstract": "Gravity controls directional growth of plants, and the classical starch-statolith hypothesis proposed more than a century ago postulates that amyloplast sedimentation in specialized cells initiates gravity sensing, but the molecular mechanism remains mysterious. Here, we report that gravistimulation by reorientation triggers the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling-mediated phosphorylation of LAZY proteins, the key regulators of gravitropism accumulated more on the lower side of the plasma membrane in columella cells in regular growth Arabidopsis. Phosphorylation of LAZY increases its interaction with several TOC proteins on the surface of amyloplasts, facilitating the translocation of LAZY proteins from the plasma membrane to the amyloplasts. Amyloplast sedimentation subsequently guides LAZY to relocate to the new lower side of the plasma membrane in columella cells, where LAZY induces asymmetrical auxin distribution and differential growth. Together, this study provides a molecular interpretation for the starch-statolith hypothesis: the organelle movement-triggered molecular polarity formation.",

    "abstract": "Developments in bioengineering and nanotechnology have ignited the research on biological and molecular communication systems. Despite potential benefits, engineering communication systems to carry data signals using biological messenger molecules is challenging. Diffusing molecules may fall behind their schedule to arrive at a receiver, interfering with symbols of subsequent time slots and distorting the signal. Theoretical molecular communication models often focus solely on the characteristics of the communication channel and fail to provide an end-to-end system response, since they assume a simple thresholding process for a receiver cell and overlook how the receiver can detect the incoming distorted molecular signal. There is a need to develop viable end-to-end communication models. In this paper, we present a model-based framework for designing diffusion-based molecular communication systems coupled with synthetic genetic circuits. We describe a novel approach to encode information as a sequence of bits, each transmitted from a sender as a burst of specific number of molecules, control cellular behavior, and minimize cellular signal interference by employing equalization techniques from communication theory. This approach allows the encoding and de-coding of data bits efficiently using two different types of molecules that act as the data carrier and the antagonist to cancel out the heavy tail of the former. We also present Period Finder, as a tool to optimize communication parameters, including the number of molecules and symbol duration. This tool facilitates automating the choice of communication parameters and identifying the best communication scenarios that can produce efficient cellular signals.",

    "abstract": "Upregulation of nuclear factor {kappa}B (NF{kappa}B) signaling is a hallmark of aging and major cause of age-related chronic inflammation; however, its physiological functions and mechanisms remain unclear. By combining mathematical modeling and experiments, we show that dysfunction of negative feedback regulators of NF{kappa}B, I{kappa}B and A20, alters the NF{kappa}B nuclear dynamics from oscillatory to sustained, promoting cellular senescence by remodeling epigenetic regulation and metabolic landscape. Sustained NF{kappa}B activity by I{kappa}B downregulation enhanced inflammation- and senescence-associated gene expression through increased NF{kappa}B-DNA binding and slowed the cell cycle by upregulating purine catabolism via mTORC2/AKT pathways. Notably, I{kappa}B knockdown combined with A20 overexpression resulted in lower NF{kappa}B amplitude, cytokine expression, and SA-{beta}-gal activity than I{kappa}B knockdown alone. I{kappa}B downregulation is correlated with hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) expression in the purine salvage pathway in aged mouse hearts. Our study suggests that nuclear NF{kappa}B homeostasis is critical for balancing purine metabolism associated with chronic inflammation and tissue aging.",

    "abstract": "Environmental light is perceived and anticipated by organisms to synchronize their biological cycles. Therefore, exposure to artificial light at night could disrupt diurnal and seasonal rhythmicity. Reproduction is a complex physiological process involving integration of environmental signals by the brain, and release of endocrine signals by the pituitary that regulate gametogenesis and spawning. In addition, males from many species form a dominance hierarchy that, through a combination of aggressive and protective behavior, influences their reproductive success. In this study, we investigated the effect of different light regimes, including light pollution at night and continuous light, on the fitness of male fish within a dominance hierarchy using a model fish, the Japanese medaka. In normal light/dark rhythm conditions, we observed that dominant males are more aggressive, remain closer to the female, and spend ten-fold more time spawning than subordinates. By using males with different genotypes, we determined the paternity of the progeny and found that even though subordinate males spend less time with the females, they are equally successful at fertilizing eggs in normal light conditions due to an efficient sneaking behavior. However, when exposed to light at night, dominant males fertilize more eggs. We indeed found that when exposed to nocturnal light pollution, dominant males produce higher quality sperm than subordinate males. Surprisingly, we did not find differences in circulating sex steroid levels, pituitary gonadotropin levels, or gonadosomatic index between dominant and subordinate males, neither in control nor night light condition. Continuous light was found to completely inhibit establishment of male hierarchy. This study is the first to report an effect of light pollution on sperm quality with an impact on male fertilization success in any vertebrate. It has broad implications for fish ecology in urban areas with potential impacts on the genetic diversity of these fish populations.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=95 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/536935v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@149072dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1763cd7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@194586aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@38c518_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIIn a triadic relationship, subordinate medaka show sneaking behavior during female spawning, allowing them to produce about 50% of the offspring.\nC_LIO_LIContinuous light inhibits establishment of male hierarchy.\nC_LIO_LILight pollution at night shifts the balance of reproductive efficiency between dominant and subordinate males, benefiting dominant males.\nC_LIO_LIExposure to light pollution at night improves sperm quality in dominant fish relative to subordinates, but does not clearly affect reproductive hormone levels.\nC_LI",

In this study, we used such high-temporal resolution fMRI data to evaluate the effectiveness of several data-driven denoising methods, including global-signal regression (GSR), white matter and cerebrospinal fluid regression (WM-CSF), anatomical (aCompCor) and temporal CompCor (tCompCor), ICA-AROMA. Our analysis focused on each methods ability to remove cardiac and respiratory signal power, as well as its ability to preserve low-frequency signals and age-related functional connectivity (fcMRI) differences. Our findings revealed that ICA-AROMA and GSR consistently remove more heart-beat and respiratory frequencies, but also the most low-frequency signals. Our results confirm that the ICA-AROMA and GSR removed the most physiological noise at the expense of meaningful age-related fcMRI differences. On the other hand, aCompCor and tCompCor seem to provide a good balance between removing physiological signals and preserving fcMRI information. Lastly, methods differ in performance on young- and older-adult data sets. While this study cautions direct comparisons of fcMRI results based on different denoising methods in the study of aging, it also informs the choice of denoising method for broader fcMRI applications.",

Exercise stimulates AHN in rodents and improves memory and slows cognitive decline in AD patients. However, the molecular pathways for exercise-induced AHN and improved cognition in AD are poorly understood. Here, we show that voluntary running in APPSWE mice restores their hippocampal cognitive impairments to that of control mice. This cognitive rescue was abolished by RGS6 deletion in dentate gyrus (DG) neuronal progenitors (NPs), which also abolished running-mediated increases in AHN. AHN was reduced in sedentary APPSWE mice versus control mice, with basal AHN reduced by RGS6 deletion in DG NPs. RGS6 expression is significantly lower in the DG of AD patients. Thus, RGS6 mediates exercise-induced rescue of impaired cognition and AHN in AD mice, identifying RGS6 in DG NPs as a potential target to combat hippocampal neuron loss in AD.\n\nTeaserRGS6 expression in hippocampal NPCs promotes voluntary running-induced neurogenesis and restored cognition in APPSWE mice.\n\nField CodesRGS6, Alzheimers disease, adult hippocampal neurogenesis, neural precursor cells, dentate gyrus, exercise, learning/memory",

    "abstract": "When a sequence of written words is briefly presented and participants are asked to identify just one word at a post-cued location, then word identification accuracy is higher when the word is presented in a grammatically correct sequence compared with an ungrammatical sequence. This sentence superiority effect has been reported in several behavioral studies and two EEG investigations. Taken together, the results of these studies support the hypothesis that the sentence superiority effect is primarily driven by rapid access to a sentence-level representation via partial word identification processes that operate in parallel over several words. Here we used MEG to examine the neural structures involved in this early stage of written sentence processing, and to further specify the timing of the different processes involved. Source activities over time showed grammatical vs. ungrammatical differences first in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG: 325-400 ms), then the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL: 475-525 ms), and finally in both left IFG and left posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG: 550-600 ms). We interpret the early IFG activity as reflecting the rapid bottom-up activation of sentence-level representations, including syntax, enabled by partly parallel word processing. Subsequent activity in ATL and pSTG is thought to reflect the constraints imposed by such sentence-level representations on on-going word-based semantic activation (ATL), and the subsequent development of a more detailed sentence-level representation (pSTG). These results provide further support for a cascaded interactive-activation account of sentence reading.",

Increased understanding of the modulatory pathways controlling CD8 T cells had led to the formulation of successful checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapies against cancer. However, superfluous mechanisms acting to prevent immunopathology can further restrict immune activation. PTPN1 and PTPN2 are two homologous tyrosine phosphatases halting alternative CD8 activating pathways such as the proinflammatory cytokines and the TCR conferring them exceptional immunotherapeutic potential. Herein we investigated to what extent their homology translates into functional redundancy in CD8 T cells, exploring the potential benefits or risks of inhibiting them synchronously. Our results demonstrated that hemizygous deletion of PTPN1 in a PTPN2 deficient background heightens the enhanced effector phenotype already observed in PTPN2 defective CD8 T cells. This effect was evident in their transcriptomic signature and was reproducible with small- molecule inhibitors simultaneously hindering both phosphatases.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors T-bet and ROR{psi}t play a crucial role in neuronal autoimmunity, and mice deficient in these two factors do not develop experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The independent role of T-bet and ROR{psi}t in the pathogenesis of EAE and how they help induce apoptosis of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) during neuronal autoimmunity is unclear. In the present study, we showed that myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG35-55) peptide-specific Th1 cells deficient in ROR{psi}t could cross BBB but fail to induce apoptosis of neurons and EAE. Pathogenic Th17 cell-derived cytokines GM-CSF, TNF-, IL-17A, and IL-21 significantly increase the surface expression of IL-23R on neuronal cells. Furthermore, we showed that, in EAE, neurons in the brain and spinal cord express IL-23R. IL-23-IL-23R signaling in neuronal cells caused phosphorylation of STAT3 (Ser727 and Tyr705) and induced cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) molecules in an IL-23R-dependent manner and caused apoptosis. Thus, we provided a mechanism where we showed that T-bet is required to recruit pathogenic Th17 cells and ROR{psi}t expression to drive the apoptosis of IL-23R+ neurons in the CNS and cause EAE. Understanding detailed molecular mechanisms will help to design better strategies to control neuroinflammation and autoimmunity.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=136 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/537133v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2586b0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1adb3deorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fbce53org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a6d4ae_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG One Sentence SummaryIL-23-IL-23R signaling promotes apoptosis of CNS neurons.",

    "abstract": "The adult brain is made up of anatomically and functionally distinct regions with specific neuronal compositions. At the root of this neuronal diversity are neural stem and progenitor cells (NPCs) that produce many neurons throughout embryonic development. During development, NPCs switch from initial expanding divisions to neurogenic divisions, which marks the onset of neurogenesis. Here, we aimed to understand when NPCs switch division modes to generate the first neurons in the anterior-most part of the zebrafish brain, the telencephalon. To this end, we used the deep learning-based segmentation method Cellpose and clonal analysis of individual NPCs to assess production of neurons by NPCs in the first 24 hours of zebrafish telencephalon development. Our results provide a quantitative atlas detailing the production of telencephalic neurons and NPC division modes between 14 and 24 hours post-fertilization. We find that within this timeframe, the switch to neurogenesis is gradual, with considerable heterogeneity in individual NPC neurogenic potential and division rates. This quantitative characterization of initial neurogenesis in the zebrafish telencephalon establishes a basis for future studies aimed at illuminating the molecular mechanisms and regulators of early neurogenesis.",

We mapped genome-wide chromatin contacts and TF binding profiles in HSPC subsets (HSC, CMP, GMP, MEP) and found that heptad occupancy and enhancer-promoter interactions varied significantly across cell types and were associated with cell-type-specific gene expression. Distinct regulatory elements were enriched with specific heptad-TF combinations, including stem-cell-specific elements with ERG, and myeloid- and erythroid-specific elements with combinations of FLI1, RUNX1, GATA2, TAL1, LYL1, and LMO2.

However, it is unclear what determines the ability of individual strains or species to adapt to new environments. Here, we use pan-genome scale modeling to explore the ability of 102 different unicellular organisms to adapt to each of 5000+ diverse nutritional environments. While the small metabolic systems of specialized endosymbionts typically require 50+ additional metabolic reactions to adapt to new environments, different strains of the generalist E. coli require on average less than 5 new reactions. Thus, there is a positive feedback between metabolic complexity and adaptability, contrary to speculations that complex systems are generally less adaptable.",

    "abstract": "The effect of population bottlenecks and genome reduction on enzyme function is poorly understood.  Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum is a bacterium with a reduced genome that is transmitted vertically to the egg of an infected psyllid--a population bottleneck that imposes genetic drift and is predicted to affect protein structure and function. Here, we define the effects of genome reduction and genetic drift on the function of Ca. L. solanacearum dihydrodipicolinate synthase (CLsoDHDPS), which catalyses the committed branchpoint reaction in diaminopimelate and lysine biosynthesis. We demonstrate that CLsoDHDPS is expressed in Ca. L. solanacearum and expression is increased [~]2-fold in the insect host compared to in planta. CLsoDHDPS has increased aggregation propensity, implying mutations have destabilised the enzyme but are compensated for through elevated chaperone expression and a stabilised oligomeric state. CLsoDHDPS uses a ternary-complex kinetic mechanism, which is unique among DHDPS enzymes, has unusually low catalytic ability, but an unusually high substrate affinity. Structural studies demonstrate that the active site is more open, and the structure of CLsoDHDPS with both pyruvate and the substrate analogue succinic-semialdehyde reveals that the product is both structurally and energetically different and therefore evolution has in this case fashioned a new enzyme. Our study reveals the effects of genome reduction and genetic drift on the function of essential enzymes and provides insights on bacteria-host co-evolutionary association. We suggest that bacteria with endosymbiotic lifestyles present a rich vein of interesting enzymes useful for understanding enzyme function and/or informing protein engineering efforts.",

    "abstract": "Allopolyploidization is a frequent evolutionary transition in plants that combines whole-genome duplication (WGD) and interspecific hybridization. The genome of an allopolyploid species results from initial interactions between parental genomes and long-term evolution. Telling apart the contributions of these two phases is essential to understand the evolutionary trajectory of allopolyploid species. Here, we compared phenotypic and transcriptomic changes in natural and resynthesized Capsella allotetraploids with their diploid parental species. We focused on phenotypic traits associated with the selfing syndrome and on transcription-level phenomena such as expression level dominance (ELD), transgressive expression (TRE), and homoeolog expression bias (HEB).\n\nWe found that selfing syndrome, high pollen and seed quality in natural allotetraploids likely resulted from long-term evolution. Similarly, TRE and most down-regulated ELDs were only found in natural allopolyploids. Natural allotetraploids also had more ELDs toward the self-fertilizing parental species than resynthesized allotetraploids, mirroring the establishment of the selfing syndrome. However, short-term changes mattered, and 40% of ELDs in natural allotetraploids were already observed in resynthesized allotetraploids. Resynthesized allotetraploids showed striking HEB variation among chromosomes and individuals. Homoeologous synapsis was its primary source and may still be a source of genetic variation in natural allotetraploids.\n\nIn conclusion, both short- and long-term mechanisms contributed to transcriptomic and phenotypic changes in natural allotetraploids. However, the initial gene expression changes were largely reshaped during long-term evolution leading to further morphological changes.",

    "abstract": "Ribosome hibernation is a key survival strategy bacteria adopt under environmental stress, where a protein, hibernation promotion factor (HPF), transitorily inactivates the ribosome and slows down its overall protein synthesis. The mechanism is well studied in enteric bacteria, which mainly hibernate its ribosome in 100S disome form through a dual domain, long HPF (HPFlong) or a single domain, short HPF (HPFshort) in concert with another ribosome modulation factor. Mycobacteria under hypoxia (low oxygen) stress overexpresses RafH protein regulated under DosR regulon, a critical factor for its survival. The RafH, a dual domain HPF, an orthologue of bacterial HPFlong, hibernates ribosome in 70S monosome form only. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of Mycobacterium smegmatis, a close homologue of M. tuberculosis, 70S ribosome in complex with the RafH factor at an overall 2.8 [A] resolution. The RafH N-terminus domain (NTD) is conserved and binds to the decoding center of the ribosomal small subunit, a similar binding site of HPFlong NTD, but additionally it also interacts with the inter subunit bridge, B2a. Contrary to the HPFlong CTD, the RafH CTD, which is larger, binds to a unique site at the platform binding center of the ribosomal small subunit and sandwiches between bS1 and uS11 ribosomal proteins. The two domain connecting linker regions, which remain mostly disordered in earlier reported HPFlong structures, interacts mainly with the anti-Shine Dalgarno sequence of the 16S rRNA. The helix H54a of 23S rRNA, unique to the mycobacterial ribosome, adopts a different conformation and come close to RafH CTD, suggesting its role in ribosome hibernation. RafH inhibits in-vitro protein synthesis in a concentration dependent manner. Further, the modeling studies provided the structural basis for the incompatibility of mycobacterial ribosomes forming 100S like hibernating ribosomes.",

    "abstract": "Amino acid dynamics are significant in determining the overall function, structure, stability, and activity of proteins. However, atomic-level descriptions of the structural features of proteins are limited by the current resolutions of experimental and computational techniques. In this study, we developed a machine learning (ML) framework for characterizing the individual aminoacids dynamic in a protein and compute its contribution to the overall function of proteins. This framewor identifies specific types of angular features in amino acids, such as bimodal-switch residues. It can assist in the analysis of various protein characteristics and provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of individual amino acids within a protein structure. We found that there is a strong correlation between a specific type of bimodal-switch residues and the global features in proteins. This knowledge can help us to identify key residues that are strongly correlated to the overall function of the protein.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria have emerged as attractive microbial cell factories, as they can convert atmospheric CO2 and sunlight into valuable chemicals. To increase their growth and productivity, one should aim to optimize the allocation of limited cellular resources across different metabolic processes. Here, we developed two growth balance analysis (GBA) models for the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. In its biological assumptions, the models closely related to an existing coarse-grained model, while its mathematical formulation is heavily streamlined. We show that the GBA models provide virtually identical predictions about cellular resource allocation among photosynthesis, carbon metabolism, and the protein translation machinery under different environmental conditions as the previous, mathematically more involved model. Our model also captures the effects of photodamage on proteome allocation and the resulting growth rates. We further show how the GBA model can be easily extended to include more reactions, leading to a second GBA model capable of new predictions about the cellular resource allocation. Balanced growth models of the type presented here can easily expanded to include more biological details, providing a useful toolbox for the understanding of the physiological capabilities of cyanobacteria, their allocation of cellular resources, and the potential of their bioengineering for optimized biomass production.",

    "abstract": "Expectations are often dynamic: any sports fan knows that expectations are rapidly updated as games unfold. Yet expectations have traditionally been studied as static. Here, using slot machines as a case study, we provide parallel behavioral and electrophysiological evidence of sub-second moment-to-moment changes in expectations. In Study 1, we show that the dynamics of the EEG signal before the slot machine stopped differed depending on the nature of the outcome, including not only whether the participant won or lost, but also how close they came to winning. In line with our predictions, Near Win Before outcomes (the slot machine stops one item before a match) were similar to Wins, but different than Near Win After (the machine stops one item after a match) and Full Miss (the machine stops two or three items from a match). In Study 2, we designed a novel behavioral paradigm to measure moment-to-moment changes in expectations via dynamic betting. We found that different outcomes also elicited unique expectation trajectories in the deceleration phase. Notably, these behavioral expectation trajectories paralleled Study 1s EEG activity in the last second prior to the machines stop. In Studies 3 (EEG) and 4 (behavior) we replicated these findings in the loss domain where a match entails a loss. Again, we found a significant correlation between behavioral and EEG results. These four studies provide the first evidence that dynamic sub-second updates in expectations can be behaviorally and electrophysiologically measured. Our findings open up new avenues for studying the ongoing dynamics of reward expectations and their role in healthy and unhealthy cognition.",

    "abstract": "Fetal MRI is widely used for quantitative brain volumetry studies. However, currently, there is a lack of universally accepted protocols for fetal brain parcellation and segmentation. Published clinical studies tend to use different segmentation approaches that also reportedly require significant amounts of time-consuming manual refinement. In this work, we propose to address this challenge by developing a new robust deep learning-based fetal brain segmentation pipeline for 3D T2w motion corrected brain images. At first, we defined a new refined brain tissue parcellation protocol with 19 regions-of-interest using the new fetal brain MRI atlas from the Developing Human Connectome Project. This protocol design was based on evidence from histological brain atlases, clear visibility of the structures in individual subject 3D T2w images and the clinical relevance to quantitative studies. It was then used as a basis for developing an automated deep learning brain tissue parcellation pipeline trained on 360 fetal MRI datasets with different acquisition parameters using semi-supervised approach with manually refined labels propagated from the atlas. The pipeline demonstrated robust performance for different acquisition protocols and GA ranges. Analysis of tissue volumetry for 390 normal participants (21-38 weeks gestational age range), scanned with three different acquisition protocols, did not reveal significant differences for major structures in the growth charts. Only minor errors were present in < 15% of cases thus significantly reducing the need for manual refinement. In addition, quantitative comparison between 65 fetuses with ventriculomegaly and 60 normal control cases were in agreement with the findings reported in our earlier work based on manual segmentations. These preliminary results support the feasibility of the proposed atlas-based deep learning approach for large-scale volumetric analysis. The created fetal brain volumetry centiles and a docker with the proposed pipeline are publicly available online at https://hub.docker.com/r/fetalsvrtk/segmentation (tag brain bounti tissue).",

    "abstract": "The ability of humans to identify and reproduce short time intervals (in the region of a second) may be affected by many factors ranging from the gender of the individual observer, through the attentional state, to the precise spatiotemporal structure of the stimulus. The relative roles of these very different factors are a challenge to describe and define; several methodological approaches have been used to achieve this to varying degrees of success. Here we describe a new paradigm affording not only a first-order measurement of the perceived duration of an interval but also a second-order metacognitive judgement of perceived time. This approach, we argue, expands the form of the data generally collected in duration-judgements and allows more detailed comparison of psychophysical behaviour to the underlying theory. We also describe a measurement model which provides estimates of the variability of the temporal estimates and the metacognitive judgments allowing comparison to an ideal observer. We fit the model to data collected for judgements of 750ms (bisecting 1500ms) and 1500ms (bisecting 3000ms) intervals across three stimulus modalities (Visual, Audio & Audiovisual). This enhanced form of data on a given interval judgement and the ability to track its progression on a trial-by-trial basis offers a way of looking at the different roles that subject-based, task-based and stimulus-based factors have on the perception of time.",

The departure from a linear sum of each individual response is referred to as normalization. In mammals, normalization has been best characterized in the visual cortex of macaques and cats. Here we study visually evoked normalization in the visual cortex of awake mice using optical imaging of calcium indicators in large populations of layer 2/3 (L2/3) V1 excitatory neurons and electrophysiological recordings across layers in V1. Regardless of recording method, mouse visual cortical neurons exhibit normalization to varying degrees.

    "abstract": "The condensed form of neural extracellular matrix (ECM), perineuronal nets (PNNs), is predominantly associated with parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons in the cortex and hippocampus. PNNs are enriched in several lecticans, including neurocan (Ncan). A polymorphism in the human Ncan gene has been associated with alterations in hippocampus-dependent memory function, variation of prefrontal cortex structure, and a higher risk for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Ncan knockout (KO) mice show related behavioral abnormalities, such as hyperactivity. Here we focused on studying how dysregulation of Ncan specifically in the mPFC may affect cognitive and synaptic functions. Intracortical adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery was used to express shRNA against Ncan. Analysis of PNNs in Ncan shRNA-injected mice revealed a reduction in PNNs labelling by Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) around PV+ interneurons. Reduced Ncan expression resulted in a loss of the mPFC-dependent temporal order recognition and impairment of reversal spatial learning in a labyrinth (dry maze) task. As a potential synaptic substrate of these cognitive abnormalities, we report a robust reduction in the perisomatic GABAergic innervation of PV+ cells in Ncan KO and Ncan shRNA-injected mice. We also observed an increase in the density of vGLUT1-immunopositive synaptic puncta in the neuropil of Ncan shRNA-injected mice, which was, however, compensated in Ncan KO mice. Thus, our findings highlight a functional role of Ncan in supporting perisomatic GABAergic inhibition, temporal order recognition memory and cognitive flexibility, as one of the important cognitive resources depleted in neuropsychiatric disorders.\n\nContribution to the fieldIn this study, we asked if the extracellular matrix proteoglycan neurocan (Ncan) plays a functional role in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice. Using viral delivery and expression of shRNA to knock down the expression of Ncan in the PFC, we provide evidence that neuronal Ncan is essential for the maintenance of perineuronal nets enveloping perisomatic interneurons by influencing the expression of glycoepitopes stained with Wisteria floribunda agglutinin and by modulating mRNA expression levels of other PNNs constituents. At the behavioral level, the knockdown of Ncan in mPFC impaired the temporal order recognition memory and consolidation/retrieval of spatial memories after reversal learning in the dry maze task. At the synaptic level, we found that Ncan knockdown reduced perisomatic GABAergic innervation of perisomatic interneurons and increased the density of vGLUT1+ excitatory presynaptic terminals in the neuropil of the PFC. Moreover, knockdown of Ncan changed the expression levels of several genes involved in activity-dependent synaptic remodeling. In summary, we conclude that neuronal Ncan is essential for multiple cognitive flexibility-related synaptic and cognitive functions in the PFC.",

    "abstract": "Animal models indicate that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays a modulatory role in stress and reward processing, both crucially impaired in addictive disorders. Preclinical findings showed endocannabinoid-modulated synaptic plasticity in reward brain networks linked to the metabotropic-glutamate-5 receptor (mGluR5), contributing to drug-reinforcing effects and drug-seeking behavior. Although animal models postulate a link between ECS and cocaine addiction, human translational studies are lacking. Here, we tested previous preclinical findings by investigating plasma endocannabinoids (eCBs) anandamide (AEA), 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), and the related N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA), including their interaction with cerebral mGluR5, in chronic cocaine users (CU). We compared basal plasma concentrations between chronic CU (N=103; 69 recreational CU and 34 dependent CU) and stimulant-naive healthy controls (N=92). Follow-up basal eCB/NAE plasma levels after 12 months were used for reliability and stability check (CU: N=33; controls: N=43). In an additional analysis using 11C-ABP688 positron emission tomography (PET) in a male subsample (CU: N=18; controls: N=16), we investigated the relationships between eCBs/NAEs and mGluR5 density in the brain. We found higher 2-AG plasma levels in dependent CU compared to controls and recreational CU. 2-AG levels were stable over time across all groups. In the PET-subsample, a positive association between 2-AG and mGluR5 brain density only in CU was found. Our results corroborate animal findings suggesting an alteration of the ECS in cocaine dependence and an association between peripheral 2-AG levels and cerebral mGluR5 in humans. Therefore, the ECS might be a promising pharmaco-therapeutic target for novel treatments of cocaine dependence.",

    "abstract": "Neural bases of consciousness have been explored through many different paradigms and the notion of complexity emerged as a unifying framework to characterize conscious experience. To date, the perturbational complexity index (PCI), rooted on information theory, shows high performance in assessing consciousness. However, the mechanisms underpinning this perturbational complexity remain unclear as well as its counterpart in spontaneous activity. In the present study, we explore brain responsiveness and resting-state activity through large-scale brain modeling and prove that complexity and consciousness are directly associated with a fluid dynamical regime. This fluidity is reflected in the dynamic functional connectivity, and other metrics drawn from dynamical systems theory and manifolds can capture such dynamics in synthetic data. We then validate our findings on a cohort of 15 subjects under anesthesia and wakefulness and show that measures of fluidity on spontaneous activity can distinguish consciousness in agreement with perturbational complexity.",

    "abstract": "Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) polymorphism is maintained by balancing selection through host-pathogen interactions and mate choice. MHC-based mate choice has been proposed across a wide range of vertebrates. However, the likelihood of its existence in songbirds has been questioned because of their poorly developed olfactory sense, which is a trait considered crucial in pre-copulatory mate choice to determine both own MHC and the MHC of putative partners. In this study, we show that female reed warblers, Acrocephalus scirpaceus, with extra-pair young in their nests have a lower MHC class I (MHC-I) dissimilarity with their social mate than females without extra-pair young in their nests. We also show that the MHC-I dissimilarity of successfully siring extra-pair males is not different from that of either the other males with territories surrounding the social nest (i.e. putative extra-pair males) or the pairs without extra-pair young in their nests. Taken together with the observation that extra-pair mating in reed warblers is common, we argue that these results support a scenario where extra-pair mating is more likely to lead to successful fertilisation when there is a high similarity in MHC-I between the female and her social male. Furthermore, as our data suggest that extra-pair mating at random can result in a higher MHC-I dissimilarity this scenario does not require any active female mate choice for MHC-I dissimilar males to drive this pattern.",

To address this issue, we recently launched the TmAlphaFold database, where predicted AlphaFold2 structures are embedded into the membrane plane and a quality assessment is provided for each prediction using geometrical evaluation. In this paper, we analyze how AF2 has changed the structural coverage of membrane proteins compared to earlier years when only experimental structures were available, and high-throughput structure prediction was greatly limited. We also evaluate how AF2 can be used to search for (distant) homologs in highly diverse protein families. By combining quality assessment and homology search, we can pinpoint protein families where AF2 accuracy is limited, and experimental approaches are still desired.",

    "abstract": "DEAD-box helicases are important regulators of biomolecular condensates. However, the mechanisms through which these enzymes affect the dynamics of biomolecular condensates have not been systematically explored. Here, we demonstrate the mechanism by which mutation of a DEAD-box helicases catalytic core alters ribonucleoprotein condensate dynamics in the presence of ATP. Through altering RNA length within the system, we are able to attribute the altered biomolecular dynamics and material properties to physical crosslinking of RNA facilitated by the mutant helicase. These results suggest the mutant condensates approach a gel transition when RNA length is increased to lengths comparable to eukaryotic mRNA. Lastly, we show that this crosslinking effect is tunable with ATP concentration, uncovering a system whose RNA mobility and material properties vary with enzyme activity. More generally, these findings point to a fundamental mechanism for modulating condensate dynamics and emergent material properties through nonequilibrium, molecular-scale interactions.\n\nSignificanceBiomolecular condensates are membraneless organelles which organize cellular biochemistry. These structures have a diversity of material properties and dynamics which are crucial to their function. How condensate properties are determined by biomolecular interactions and enzyme activity remain open questions. DEAD-box helicases have been identified as central regulators of many protein-RNA condensates, though their specific mechanistic roles are ill-defined. In this work, we demonstrate that a DEAD-box helicase mutation crosslinks condensate RNA in an ATP-dependent fashion via protein-RNA clamping. Protein and RNA diffusion can be tuned with ATP concentration, corresponding to an order of magnitude change in condensate viscosity. These findings expand our understanding of control points for cellular biomolecular condensates that have implications for medicine and bioengineering.",

    "abstract": "Non-native pests, climate change, and their interactions are likely to alter relationships between trees and tree-associated organisms with consequences for forest health. To understand and predict such changes, factors structuring tree-associated communities need to be determined. Here, we analysed the data consisting of records of insects and fungi collected from dormant twigs from 155 tree species at 51 botanical gardens or arboreta in 32 countries. Generalized dissimilarity models revealed similar relative importance of studied climatic, host-related and geographic factors on differences in tree-associated communities. Mean annual temperature, phylogenetic distance between hosts and geographic distance between locations were the major drivers of dissimilarities. The increasing importance of high temperatures on differences in studied communities indicate that climate change could affect tree-associated organisms directly and indirectly through host range shifts. Insect and fungal communities were more similar between closely related vs. distant hosts suggesting that host range shifts may facilitate the emergence of new pests. Moreover, dissimilarities among tree-associated communities increased with geographic distance suggesting that human-mediated transport may facilitate the introductions of new pests. The results of this study highlight the need to limit the establishment of tree pests and increase the resilience of forest ecosystems to changes in climate.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation to novel ecological niches is known to be rapid. However, how ecological divergence translates into reproductive isolation remains a consequential question in speciation research. It is still unclear how coupling of ecological divergence loci and reproductive isolation loci occurs at the genomic level, ultimately enabling the formation of persistent species. Here, we investigate the genomic underpinning colonization of a new niche and formation of two host races in Tephritis conura peacock flies that persist in sympatry. To uncover the genomic differences underlying host plant adaptation, we take advantage of two independent sympatric zones, where host plant specialists using the thistle species Cirsium heterophyllum and C. oleraceum co-occur, and address what regions of the genome that diverge between the host races in a parallel fashion. Using Population Branch Statistics, dxy and BayPass we identify 2996 and 3107 outlier regions associated with host use among western and eastern Baltic populations, respectively, with 82% overlap. The majority of outliers are located within putative inversions, adding to the growing body of evidence that structural changes to the genome are important for adaptations to persist in face of gene flow. Potentially, the high contents of repetitive elements could have given rise to the inversions, but this remains to be tested. The outlier regions were enriched for genes involved in e.g. metabolism and morphogenesis, potentially due to the selection for processing different metabolites, and changes in size and ovipositor length respectively. In conclusion, this study suggests that structural changes in the genome, and divergence in independent ecological functions may facilitate the formation of persistent host races in face of gene flow.",

Here we focus on Fagales, an iconic member of forests worldwide, to uncover global diversity and endemism patterns and investigate potential drivers responsible for the spatial distribution of fagalean forest communities.\n\nLocationGlobal.\n\nTaxonFagales.\n\nMethodsWe combined phylogenetic data covering 60.2% of living species, fine-scale distribution models covering 90% of species, and nodulation data covering all species to investigate the distribution of species richness at fine spatial scales and compare this to relative phylogenetic diversity (RPD) and phylogenetic endemism. Further, we quantify phylogenetic betadiversity and bioregionalization of Fagales and determine hotspots of Fagales species engaging in root nodule symbiosis (RNS) with nitrogen-fixing actinomycetes.\n\nResultsWe find the highest richness in temperate east Asia, eastern North America, and equatorial montane regions of Asia and Central America. By contrast, RPD is highest at higher latitudes, where RNS also predominates. We found a strong spatial structuring of regionalizations of Fagales floras as defined by phylogeny and traits related to RNS, reflecting distinct Northern and Southern Hemisphere floras (with the exception of a unique Afro-Boreal region) and highly distinct tropical montane communities.\n\nMain conclusionsSpecies richness and phylogenetic regionalization accord well with traditional biogeographic concepts for temperate forests, but RPD does not. This may reflect ecological filtering specific to Fagales, as RNS strategies are almost universal in the highest RPD regions. Our results highlight the importance of global-scale, clade-specific spatial phylogenetics and its utility for understanding the history behind temperate forest diversity.",

    "abstract": "1Decades of research have investigated the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control the immune response to malaria. Yet, many studies offer conflicting results on the functional impact of innate immunity for controlling parasite replication early in infection. We conduct a meta-analysis to probe for consensus on the effect of innate immunity on parasite replication, examining three different species of rodent malaria parasite. Screening published studies that span four decades of research we collate, curate and statistically analyse infection dynamics in immune deficient or augmented mice to identify and quantify consensus and identify sources of disagreement among studies. Additionally, we estimate whether host factors or experimental methodology shape the impact of immune perturbations on parasite burden. First, we detected meta-analytic mean effect sizes (absolute Cohens h) for the difference in parasite burden between treatment and control groups ranging from 0.1498 to 0.2321 across parasite species. This range is considered a small effect size and translates to a modest change in parasitaemia of roughly 6-12% on average at the peak of infection. Second, we reveal that variation across studies using P. chabaudi or P. yoelii is best explained by stochasticity (due to small sample sizes) rather than by host factors or experimental design. Third, we find that for P. berghei the impact of immune perturbation is increased when young or female mice are used and is greatest when effector molecules (as opposed to upstream signalling molecules) are disrupted (up to an 18% difference in peak parasitaemia). Finally, we find little evidence of publication bias suggesting that our results are robust. The small effects sizes we observe, across three parasite species, following experimental perturbations of the innate immune system may be explained by redundancy in a complex biological system or by incomplete (or inappropriate) data reporting for meta-analysis. Alternatively, our findings might indicate a need to re-evaluate the efficiency with which innate immunity controls parasite replication early in infection. Testing these explanations is necessary to translate understanding from model systems to human malaria infections, manage immunopathology, and facilitate realism in mathematical models.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, commonly associated with the development of an arteriosclerotic plaque and impairment of blood flow in arteries. Current adopted grafts to bypass the stenosed vessel fail to recapitulate the unique mechanical behaviour of native vessels, particularly in the case of small diameter vessels (<6 mm), leading to graft failure. Therefore, in this study, melt-electrowriting (MEW) was adopted to produce a range of fibrous grafts to mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture of the tunica media of vessels, in an attempt to match the mechanical and biological behaviour of the native tissue. Initially, the range of collagen architectures within the native vessel was determined, and subsequently replicated using MEW (winding angles (WA) 45{degrees}, 26.5{degrees}, 18.4{degrees}, 11.3{degrees}). These scaffolds recapitulated the anisotropic, non-linear mechanical behaviour of native carotid blood vessels. Moreover, these grafts facilitated human mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (hMSC) infiltration, differentiation, and ECM deposition that was independent of WA. The bioinspired MEW fibre architecture promoted cell alignment and preferential neo-tissue orientation in a manner similar to that seen in native tissue, particularly for WA 18.4{degrees} and 11.3{degrees}, which is a mandatory requirement for long-term survival of the regenerated tissue post-scaffold degradation. Lastly, the WA 18.4{degrees} was translated to a tubular graft and was shown to mirror the mechanical behaviour of small diameter vessels within physiological strain. Taken together, this study demonstrates the capacity to use MEW to fabricate bioinspired grafts to mimic the tunica media of vessels and recapitulate vascular mechanics which could act as a framework for small diameter graft development and functional long-term tissue regeneration.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveUltrafast ultrasound imaging has been used to measure intramuscular mechanical dynamics associated with single motor unit (MU) activations. Detecting MU activity from ultrasound sequences requires decomposing a displacement velocity field into components consisting of spatial maps and temporal displacement signals. These components can be associated with putative MU activity or spurious movements (noise). The differentiation between putative MUs and noise has been accomplished by comparing the temporal displacement signals with MU firings obtained from needle EMG. Here, we examined whether the repeatability of the spatial maps over brief time intervals can serve as a criterion for distinguishing putative MUs from noise in low-force isometric contractions.\n\nApproachIn five healthy subjects, ultrafast ultrasound images and high-density surface EMG (HDsEMG) were recorded simultaneously from biceps brachii. MUs identified through HDsEMG decomposition were used as a reference to assess the outcomes of the ultrasound-based decomposition. For each contraction, displacement velocity sequences from the same eight-second ultrasound recording were separated into consecutive two-second epochs and decomposed. The Jaccard Similarity Coefficient (JSC) was employed to evaluate the repeatability of components spatial maps across epochs. Finally, the association between the ultrasound components and the MUs decomposed from HDsEMG was assessed.\n\nMain resultsAll the MU-matched components had JSC > 0.38, indicating they were repeatable and accounted for about one-third of the HDsEMG-detected MUs (1.8 {+/-} 1.6 matches over 4.9 {+/-} 1.8 MUs). The repeatable components (with JSC over the empirical threshold of 0.38) represented 14% of the total components (6.5 {+/-} 3.3 components). These findings align with our hypothesis that intra-sequence repeatability can differentiate putative MUs from spurious components and can be used for data reduction.\n\nSignificanceThe results of our study provide the foundation for developing stand-alone methods to identify MU in ultrafast ultrasound sequences and represent a step forward towards real-time imaging of active MU territories. These methods are relevant for studying muscle neuromechanics and designing novel neural interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are emerging drug targets for many diseases, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cancer. However, a high degree of structural similarity between the catalytic domains of these enzymes has made the development of selective pharmacological inhibitors an enormous challenge. Our previous research uncovered two unfunctionalized terpenoid inhibitors that selectively inhibit PTP1B over TCPTP, two PTPs with high sequence conservation. Here, we use molecular modeling with experimental validation to study the molecular basis of this unusual selectivity. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicate that PTP1B and TCPTP contain a conserved h-bond network that connects the active site to a distal allosteric pocket; this network stabilizes the closed conformation of the catalytically influential WPD loop, which it links to the L-11 loop and 3 and 7 helices--the C-terminal side of the catalytic domain. Terpenoid binding to either of two proximal allosteric sites--an  site and a {beta} site--can disrupt the allosteric network. Interestingly, binding to the  site forms a stable complex with only PTP1B; in TCPTP, where two charged residues disfavor binding at the  site, the terpenoids bind to the {beta} site, which is conserved between the two proteins. Our findings indicate that minor amino acid differences at the poorly conserved  site enable selective binding, a property that might be enhanced with chemical elaboration, and illustrate, more broadly, how minor differences in the conservation of neighboring--yet functionally similar--allosteric sites can have very different implications for inhibitor selectivity.",

    "abstract": "Transplacental antibody transfer is crucially important in shaping neonatal immunity. Recently, prenatal maternal immunization has been employed to boost pathogen-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) transfer to the fetus. Multiple factors have been implicated in antibody transfer, but how these key dynamic regulators work together to elicit the observed selectivity is pertinent to engineering vaccines for mothers to optimally immunize their newborns. Here, we present the first quantitative mechanistic model to uncover the determinants of placental antibody transfer and inform personalized immunization approaches. We identified placental Fc{gamma}RIIb primarily expressed by endothelial cells as a limiting factor in this receptor-mediated transfer, which plays a key role in promoting preferential transport of subclasses IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4, but not IgG2. Integrated computational modeling and in vitro experiments reveal that IgG subclass abundance, Fc receptor (FcR) binding affinity, and FcR abundance in syncytiotrophoblasts and endothelial cells contribute to inter-subclass competition and potentially inter- and intra-patient antibody transfer heterogeneity. We utilize this model as an in silico immunization testbed, unveiling an opportunity for precision prenatal immunization approaches that account for a patients anticipated gestational length, vaccine-induced IgG subclass, and placental FcR expression. By combining a computational model of maternal vaccination with this placental transfer model, we identified the optimal gestational age range for vaccination that maximizes the titer of antibody in the newborn. This optimum vaccination time varies with gestational age, placental properties, and vaccine-specific dynamics. This computational approach provides new perspectives on the dynamics of maternal-fetal antibody transfer in humans and potential avenues to optimize prenatal vaccinations that promote neonatal immunity.",

    "abstract": "In many bacteria, translating ribosomes are excluded from the nucleoid, while amino-acid and energy-supplying metabolic enzymes spread evenly throughout the cytoplasm. Here we show with time-lapse fluorescence microscopy that this inhomogeneous organisation of the cytoplasm can cause single Escherichia coli cells to experience an imbalance between biosynthesis and metabolism when they divide, resulting in cell size-dependent growth rate perturbations. After division, specific growth rate and ribosome concentration correlates negatively with birthsize, and positively with each other. These deviations are compensated during the cell-cycle, but smaller-than-average cells do so with qualitatively different dynamics than larger-thanaverage cells. A mathematical model of cell growth, division and regulation of biosynthetic and metabolic resource allocation reproduces our experimental findings, suggesting a simple mechanism through which long-term growth rate homeostasis is maintained while heterogeneity is continuously generated. This work shows that the life of single bacterial cells is intrinsically out-of-steady-state, dynamic and reliant on cytoplasmic organization.\n\nPopular summaryClassical, population-level studies of the metabolism and growth of bacteria indicate that the average cell in a growing population operates at steady state and can be viewed as an homogeneous  bag of enzymes. Here we show that this view does not capture the lives of single cells. At birth, they are perturbed from the steady state of their mother cell after which they need their entire cell cycle to return to this state by active regulation. Then they divide and their daughters are perturbed again; a never ending cycle that is inescapable and akin to a Sisyphean task. This behaviouremerges from the delicate interplay of the intrinsic randomness of (uneven) cell division, the inhomogeneous localisation of metabolic and ribosomal proteins in the cell, unbalanced metabolism, and compensatory steering of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "During the initiation of invasive aspergillosis, inhaled Aspergillus fumigatus conidia are deposited on the epithelial cells lining the bronchi, terminal bronchioles, and alveoli. While the interactions of A. fumigatus with bronchial and type II alveolar cell lines have been investigated in vitro, little is known about the interactions of this fungus with terminal bronchiolar epithelial cells. We compared the interactions of A. fumigatus with the A549 type II alveolar epithelial cell line and the HSAEC1-KT human small airway epithelial (HSAE) cell line. We found that A. fumigatus conidia were poorly endocytosed by A549 cells, but avidly endocytosed by HSAE cells. A. fumigatus germlings invaded both cell types by induced endocytosis, but not by active penetration. A549 cell endocytosis of A. fumigatus was independent of fungal viability, more dependent on host microfilaments than microtubules, and induced by A. fumigatus CalA interacting with host cell integrin 5{beta}1. By contrast, HSAE cell endocytosis required fungal viability, was more dependent on microtubules than microfilaments, and did not require CalA or integrin 5{beta}1. HSAE cells were more susceptible than A549 cells to damage caused by direct contact with killed A. fumigatus germlings and by secreted fungal products. In response to A. fumigatus infection, A549 cells secreted a broader profile of cytokines and chemokines than HSAE cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that studies of HSAE cells provide complementary data to A549 cells and thus represent a useful model for probing the interactions of A. fumigatus with bronchiolar epithelial cells in vitro.\n\nImportanceDuring the initiation of invasive aspergillosis, Aspergillus fumigatus invades, damages, and stimulates the epithelial cells that line the airways and alveoli. Previous studies of A. fumigatus- epithelial cell interactions in vitro have used either large airway epithelial cell lines or the A549 type II alveolar epithelial cell line. The interactions of fungi with terminal bronchiolar epithelial cells have not been investigated. Here, we compared the interactions of A. fumigatus with A549 cells and the Tert-immortalized human small airway epithelial HSAEC1-KT (HSAE) cell line. We discovered that A. fumigatus invades and damages these two cell lines by distinct mechanisms. Also, the proinflammatory responses of the cell lines to A. fumigatus are different. These results provide insight into how A. fumigatus interacts with different types of epithelial cells during invasive aspergillosis and demonstrate that HSAE cells are useful in vitro model for investigating the interactions of this fungus with bronchiolar epithelial cells.",

    "abstract": "Despite the fact that several potential organohalide-respiring bacteria (OHRB) were discovered in metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) in our previous study of marine sediments from Aarhus Bay, delineation of their roles and interactions are yet to be disentangled. Henceforth, obtaining corresponding pure cultures or more defined consortia would be highly instrumental for more detailed eco-physiological studies. To this end, we isolated a colony from an anaerobic slant tube culture inoculated with a stable PCE dehalogenating enrichment. Intriguingly, the derived culture exhibited debromination only, instead of PCE dechlorination, under sulfate-reducing conditions. The culture was capable of conserving energy for growth via debromination of 2,6-dibromophenol (2,6-DBP). Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence data extracted from shot gun metagenome sequences revealed that a strain belonging to Desulforhopalus was the predominant member of the consortium at a relative abundance of 29 %. Moreover, five bins (completeness > 85% and contamination < 3%) were assembled and all were identified as potentially new species (average nucleotide identity, ANI < 95%). Two bins from potential OHRB, bin.3 belonging to Desulfoplanes, and bin.4 belonging to Marinifilaceae, were found to encode reductive dehalogenase (RDase) genes, whereas bin.5 was found to contain a gene coding for thiolytic tetrachloro-p-hydroquinone (TPh-) RDase bearing 23.4 % identity to TPh-RDase of Sphingobium chlorophenolicum. The expression of all three RDase genes was strongly-induced after adding 2,6-DBP. Acetylene, a known inhibitor of different redox-active metalloenzymes, was found to inhibit methanogenesis as well as reductive dehalogenation without affecting gene expression, suggesting post-transcriptional inhibition. Phylogenomic analyses revealed the ecological importance of complementary roles of community members, including complete de novo vitamin B12 biosynthesis, which agreed with physiological data. Altogether, the findings presented here provided insight into the mutualism of the consortium and provided leads for synthetic OHR community optimization strategies for in situ bioremediation.",

    "abstract": "RNA viruses are diverse components of global ecosystems. The metagenomic identification of RNA viruses is currently limited to those with sequence similarity to known viruses, such that highly divergent viruses that comprise the \"dark matter\" of the virosphere remain challenging to detect. We developed a deep learning algorithm - LucaProt - to search for highly divergent RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) sequences in 10,487 global meta- transcriptomes. LucaProt integrates both sequence and structural information to accurately and efficiently detect RdRP sequences. With this approach we identified 180,571 RNA viral species and 180 superclades (viral phyla/classes). This is the broadest diversity of RNA viruses described to date, including many viruses undetectable using BLAST or HMM approaches. The newly identified RNA viruses were present in diverse ecological niches, including the air, hot springs and hydrothermal vents, and both virus diversity and abundance varied substantially among ecological types. We also identified the longest RNA virus genome (nido-like) observed so far, at 47,250 nucleotides, and expanded the diversity of RNA bacteriophage to more than ten phyla/classes. This study marks the beginning of a new era of virus discovery, with the potential to redefine our understanding of the global virosphere and reshape our understanding of virus evolutionary history.",

    "abstract": "Bacteremia, a systemic infection associated with severe clinical outcomes, is often caused by Gram-negative facultative anaerobes. ArcAB, a two-component regulatory system that represses aerobic respiration, is a key mediator of metabolic adaptation for such bacteria. Using targeted mutational analysis informed by global genetic screens, we identified the arcA gene as promoting fitness of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens but not Escherichia coli in a murine model of bacteremia. Engineered mutants lacking arcA exhibit a dysregulated response to changes in oxygen availability, iron limitation, and membrane perturbations, all of which bacterial cells experience during infection. The genetic response of the arcA mutants relative to wild-type strains to the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B demonstrates an expanded role for ArcA as an activator in response to membrane damage in addition to metabolic adaptation. ArcA function is furthermore linked to electron transport chain activity based on its response to uncoupling of proton motive force by carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Differences in lactate and acetate levels as well as lactate dehydrogenase activity between arcA mutant and wild-type cells following CCCP treatment establish an ArcA-mediated shift to fermentation independent of oxygen availability. This study highlights the semi-conserved role of ArcA during bacteremia and consolidates infection phenotypes into a comprehensive model based on respiratory activity.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYInfections of the bloodstream are life-threatening and can result in sepsis, an overreaction of the host immune system that ultimately damages the body. Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for causing many cases of bloodstream infections, also referred to as bacteremia. The long-term goal of our work is to understand how these bacteria establish and maintain infection during bacteremia. We have previously identified the transcription factor ArcA, which promotes fermentation in bacteria, as a likely contributor to the growth and survival of bacteria in this environment. Here, we study ArcA in the Gram-negative species Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens. Our findings aid in determining how these bacteria sense their environment, utilize nutrients, and generate energy while also countering attacks from the host immune system. This information is critical for developing better models of infection to inform future therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "Effective chromosome synapsis and crossover during meiosis are essential for fertility, especially in grain crops such as wheat. These processes function most efficiently in wheat at temperatures between 17-23 {degrees}C, although the genetic mechanisms for such temperature dependence are unknown. In a previously identified mutant of the hexaploid wheat reference variety  Chinese Spring lacking the long arm of chromosome 5D, exposure to low temperatures during meiosis resulted in asynapsis and crossover failure. In a second mutant (ttmei1), containing a 4 Mb deletion in chromosome 5DL, exposure to 13 {degrees}C led to similarly high levels of asynapsis and univalence. Moreover, exposure to 30 {degrees}C led to a significant, but less extreme effect on crossover. Previously, we proposed that, of 41 genes deleted in this 4 Mb region, the major meiotic gene TaDMC1-D1 was the most likely candidate for preservation of synapsis and crossover at low (and possibly high) temperatures. In the current study, using RNA-guided Cas9, we developed a new Chinese Spring CRISPR mutant, containing a 39 bp deletion in the 5D copy of DMC1, representing the first reported CRISPR-Cas9 targeted mutagenesis in Chinese Spring, and the first CRISPR mutant for DMC1 in wheat. In controlled environment experiments, wild-type Chinese Spring, CRISPR dmc1-D1 and backcrossed ttmei1 mutants were exposed to either high or low temperatures during the temperature-sensitive period from premeiotic interphase to early meiosis I. After 6-7 days at 13 {degrees}C, crossover decreased by over 95% in the dmc1-D1 mutants, when compared with wild-type plants grown under the same conditions. After 24 hours at 30 {degrees}C, dmc1-D1 mutants exhibited a reduced number of crossovers and increased univalence, although these differences were less marked than at 13 {degrees}C. Similar results were obtained for ttmei1 mutants, although their scores were more variable, possibly reflecting higher levels of background mutation. These experiments confirm our previous hypothesis that DMC1-D1 is responsible for preservation of normal synapsis and crossover at low and, to a certain extent, high temperatures. Given that reductions in crossover have significant effects on grain yield, these results have important implications for wheat breeding, particularly in the face of climate change.\n\nKey messageThe meiotic recombination gene DMC1 on wheat chromosome 5D preserves normal chromosome synapsis and crossover during periods of high and low temperature.",

    "abstract": "Summary paragraphThe elucidation of gene-silencing mechanisms by RNA interference (RNAi) and antisense oligomers has drawn increasing attention to nucleic acid medicine. However, several challenges remain to be overcome, such as in vivo stability1, target selectivity 2,3, drug delivery4,5, and induced innate immunity6. Here, we report a new, versatile, and highly-selective method to hack RNA by controlling RNA structure using short oligonucleotides (RNA hacking: RNAh) in living cells. The oligonucleotide, named Staple oligomer, hybridizes specifically to a target mRNA and artificially induces an RNA higher-order structure, RNA G-quadruplex (RGq)7, on the mRNA. As a result, the RGq allows effective suppression of the target protein translation. This technology does not require cooperation with bioprocesses including enzymatic reactions as in RNAi or antisense technologies, permitting the introduction of artificial nucleic acids into Staple oligomers to increase their in vivo stability without compromising their effectiveness. The method was validated by translational regulation of the mRNAs of TPM3, MYD88, and TRPC6, in a cell-free system and in living mammalian cells. In vivo application of the technology to TRPC6 mRNA allowed us to prevent cardiac hypertrophy in transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-treated mice with no detectable off-target effects. This technology provides new insights into gene therapy after RNAi and antisense technologies.",

    "abstract": "As the only surviving lineages of jawless fishes, hagfishes and lampreys provide a critical window into early vertebrate evolution. Here, we investigate the complex history, timing, and functional role of genome-wide duplications in vertebrates in the light of a chromosome-scale genome of the brown hagfish Eptatretus atami. Using robust chromosome-scale (paralogon-based) phylogenetic methods, we confirm the monophyly of cyclostomes, document an auto-tetraploidization (1RV) that predated the origin of crown group vertebrates [~]517 Mya, and establish the timing of subsequent independent duplications in the gnathostome and cyclostome lineages. Some 1RV gene duplications can be linked to key vertebrate innovations, suggesting that this early genomewide event contributed to the emergence of pan-vertebrate features such as neural crest. The hagfish karyotype is derived by numerous fusions relative to the ancestral cyclostome arrangement preserved by lampreys. These genomic changes were accompanied by the loss of genes essential for organ systems (eyes, osteoclast) that are absent in hagfish, accounting in part for the simplification of the hagfish body plan; other gene family expansions account for hagfishes capacity to produce slime. Finally, we characterise programmed DNA elimination in somatic cells of hagfish, identifying protein-coding and repetitive elements that are deleted during development. As in lampreys, the elimination of these genes provides a mechanism for resolving genetic conflict between soma and germline by repressing germline/pluripotency functions. Reconstruction of the early genomic history of vertebrates provides a framework for further exploration of vertebrate novelties.",

B lymphocytes play a crucial role in the regulation of the immune system and when activated secret cytokines known to attract neutrophils to sites of infection. We examined expression of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), a known chemotactic for neutrophils, in Epstein-Barr virus transformed control and BTHS B lymphoblasts. Age-matched control and BTHS B lymphoblasts were incubated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 24 h and then cell viability, CD27+, CD24+, CD38+, CD138+ and PD1+ surface marker expression and CXCL1 mRNA expression determined. Cell viability was maintained in lymphoblasts incubated with a ratio of 50:1 bacteria:B cells. Surface marker expression was unaltered between control and BTHS B lymphoblasts. In contrast, CXCL1 mRNA expression was reduced approximately 90% (p<0.05) in untreated BTHS B lymphoblasts compared to control cells and approximately 70% (p<0.05) in bacterial treated BTHS B lymphoblasts compared to control cells. Thus, naive and bacterial-activated BTHS B lymphoblasts exhibit reduced mRNA expression of the neutrophil chemoattractant factor CXCL1. We suggest that impaired bacterial activation of B cells in some BTHS patients could promote immune dysfunction, and this may contribute to infections.",

With over 470 nucleosome containing structures in the Protein Data Bank there is a wealth of information to be gleaned from these structures, especially through comparative analysis. However, due to the variability in their representation (chain naming, residue numbering, other artifacts), these structures cannot be systematically analyzed \"as is\".

By utilizing the information contained within the NucleosomeDB, researchers can gain valuable insights into how nucleosomes interact with DNA and other proteins, assess the implications of mutations and protein binding on nucleosome structure.

    "abstract": "The monocytic/macrophage system is essential for skeletal muscle homeostasis, but its dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of muscle degenerative disorders. Despite our increasing knowledge of the role of macrophages in degenerative disease, it still remains unclear how macrophages contribute to muscle fibrosis. Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics to determine the molecular attributes of dystrophic and healthy muscle macrophages. We identified six novel clusters. Unexpectedly, none corresponded to traditional definitions of M1 or M2 macrophage activation. Rather, the predominant macrophage signature in dystrophic muscle was characterized by high expression of fibrotic factors, galectin-3 and spp1. Spatial transcriptomics and computational inferences of intercellular communication indicated that spp1 regulates stromal progenitor and macrophage interactions during muscular dystrophy. Galectin-3+ macrophages were chronically activated in dystrophic muscle and adoptive transfer assays showed that the galectin-3+ phenotype was the dominant molecular program induced within the dystrophic milieu. Histological examination of human muscle biopsies revealed that galectin-3+ macrophages were also elevated in multiple myopathies. These studies advance our understanding of macrophages in muscular dystrophy by defining the transcriptional programs induced in muscle macrophages, and reveal spp1 as a major regulator of macrophage and stromal progenitor interactions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPerturbations of animal-associated microbiomes from chemical stress can affect host physiology and health. While dysbiosis induced by antibiotic treatments and disease are well known, chemical, non-antibiotic drugs have recently been shown to induce changes in microbiome composition, warranting further exploration. Loperamide is an opioid-receptor agonist drug widely prescribed drug for treating acute diarrhea in humans. Loperamide is also used as a tool to study the impact of bowel dysfunction in animal models by inducing constipation, but its effect on host-associated microbiota is poorly characterized.\n\nResultsWe used conventional and gnotobiotic larval zebrafish models to show that in addition to host-specific effects, loperamide also has anti-bacterial activities that directly induce changes in microbiota diversity. This dysbiosis is due to changes in bacterial colonization, since germ-free zebrafish mono-reconventionalized with bacterial strains sensitive to loperamide are colonized up to 100-fold lower when treated with loperamide. Consistently, the bacterial diversity of gnotobiotic zebrafish colonized by a mix of representative bacterial strains is affected by loperamide treatment.\n\nConclusionOur results demonstrate that loperamide, in addition to host effects, also induces dysbiosis in a vertebrate model, highlighting that established treatments can have underlooked secondary effects on microbiota structure and function. This study further provides a insights for future studies exploring how common medications directly induce changes in host-associated microbiota.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=103 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/537295v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11c5492org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f44f40org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17eff8corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bb691a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The rising prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a global health threat that needs to be addressed urgently. Basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor (BATF) is commonly thought to be involved in immunity, but its effect on lipid metabolism is not clear. Here, we investigated the function of BATF in hepatic lipid metabolism. BATF alleviated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis and inhibited elevated programmed cell death protein (PD)1 expression induced by HFD. A mechanistic study confirmed that BATF regulated fat accumulation by inhibiting PD1 expression and promoting energy metabolism. PD1 antibodies alleviated hepatic lipid deposition. In conclusion, we identified the regulatory role of BATF in hepatic lipid metabolism and that PD1 is a target for alleviation of NAFLD. This study provides new insights into the relationship between BATF, PD1 and NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "Decisions about whether to designate a species for conservation and protection depend on the ability to summarize their population trajectories and their risk of extinction. Such decisions may rely on quantitative population viability analyses based on a time series of abundance index values that are derived from a monitoring program. In the case of the Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys), a decision to protect a distinct population segment of the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act was informed by several indices of population abundance. In this paper, we combined individual population viability analyses into a single metric for extinction risk using a meta-analysis framework. Individual monitoring surveys for this species generally agreed that the trajectory of abundance was downward and combining data from all of the surveys produced a better summary of the population growth rate. We also used the population growth rates in a simulation to estimate the probability that the abundance of Longfin Smelt dropped too low to recover. We found that this probability of quasi-extinction was substantial, exceeding 20% over two decades. This study demonstrates a practical way that having multiple sources of information creates better information about the trajectory of a population. Individually, the surveys contribute information about specific life stages or ages to our understanding of the population. Combined into one metric and an associated graphical summary, this analysis succinctly communicates risk and creates a benchmark for evaluating future management decisions.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression is a multistep, carefully controlled process, and crosstalk between regulatory layers plays an important role in coordinating gene expression. To identify functionally relevant coordination between transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation, we performed a systematic reverse-genetic interaction screen in C. elegans. We combined RNA binding protein (RBP) and transcription factor (TF) mutants, creating over 100 RBP; TF double mutants. This screen identified a variety of unexpected double mutant phenotypes, including two strong genetic interactions between the ALS-related RBPs, fust-1 and tdp-1, and the homeodomain TF ceh-14. Losing any one of these genes alone has no significant effect on the health of the organism. However, fust-1; ceh-14 and tdp-1; ceh-14 double mutants both exhibit strong temperature-sensitive fertility defects. Both double mutants exhibit defects in gonad morphology, sperm function, and oocyte function. RNA-seq analysis of double mutants identifies ceh-14 as the main controller of transcript levels, while fust-1 and tdp-1 control splicing through a shared role in exon inhibition. We identify a cassette exon in the polyglutamine-repeat protein pqn-41 which tdp-1 inhibits. Loss of tdp-1 causes the pqn-41 exon to be aberrantly included, and forced skipping of this exon in tdp-1; ceh-14 double mutants rescues fertility. Together our findings identify a novel shared physiological role for fust-1 and tdp-1 in promoting C. elegans fertility in a ceh-14 mutant background and reveal a shared molecular function of fust-1 and tdp-1 in exon inhibition.",

It is hypothesized that tomato phytochemicals are transported to the liver and other tissues where they alter gene expression in ways that lead to favorable health outcomes. However, the effects of tomato consumption on mammalian liver gene expression and chemical profile are not well defined.\n\nMethods and resultsWe hypothesized that tomato consumption would alter mouse liver transcriptomes and metabolomes compared to a control diet. C57BL/6 mice (n=11-12/group) were fed a macronutrient matched diet containing either 10% red tomato, 10% tangerine tomato, or no tomato powder for 6 weeks after weaning. RNA-Seq followed by gene set enrichment analyses indicated that tomato type and consumption, in general, altered expression of phase I and II xenobiotic metabolism genes. Untargeted metabolomics experiments revealed distinct clustering between control and tomato fed animals. Nineteen molecular formulas (representing 75 chemical features) were identified or tentatively identified as steroidal alkaloids and isomers of their phase I and II metabolites; many of which are reported for the first time in mammals.\n\nConclusionThese data together suggest tomato consumption may impart benefits partly through enhancing detoxification potential.",

    "abstract": "It is known that metabolic defects in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) can cause degeneration of its neighboring photoreceptors in the retina, leading to retinal degenerative diseases such as age-related macular degeneration. However, how RPE metabolism supports the health of the neural retina remains unclear. The retina requires exogenous nitrogen sources for protein synthesis, neurotransmission, and energy metabolism. Using 15N tracing coupled with mass spectrometry, we found human RPE can utilize the nitrogen in proline to produce and export 13 amino acids, including glutamate, aspartate, glutamine, alanine and serine. Similarly, we found this proline nitrogen utilization in the mouse RPE/Cho but not in the neural retina of explant cultures. Co-culture of human RPE with the retina showed that the retina can take up the amino acids, especially glutamate, aspartate and glutamine, generated from proline nitrogen in the RPE. Intravenous delivery of 15N proline in vivo demonstrated 15N-derived amino acids appear earlier in the RPE before the retina. We also found proline dehydrogenase (PRODH), the key enzyme in proline catabolism, is highly enriched in the RPE but not the retina. The deletion of PRODH blocks proline nitrogen utilization in RPE and the import of proline nitrogen-derived amino acids in the retina. Our findings highlight the importance of RPE metabolism in supporting nitrogen sources for the retina, providing insight into understanding the mechanisms of the retinal metabolic ecosystem and RPE-initiated retinal degenerative diseases.",

Here we used whole genome sequencing and antibiotic susceptibility test data from 980 disease causing Escherichia coli isolated from companion and farm animals to model AMR genotypes and phenotypes for 24 antibiotics. We determined the strength of genotype-to-phenotype relationships for 197 AMR genes with elastic net logistic regression. Model predictors were designed to evaluate different potential modes of AMR genotype translation into resistance phenotypes. Our results show a model that considers the presence of individual AMR genes and total number of AMR genes present from a set of genes known to confer resistance was able to accurately predict isolate resistance on average (mean F1 score = 98.0%, SD = 2.3%, mean accuracy = 98.2%, SD = 2.7%). However, fitted models sometimes varied for antibiotics in the same class and for the same antibiotic across animal hosts, suggesting heterogeneity in the genetic determinants of AMR resistance. We conclude that an interpretable AMR prediction model can be used to accurately predict resistance phenotypes across multiple host species and reveal testable hypotheses about how the mechanism of resistance may vary across antibiotics within the same class and across animal hosts for the same antibiotic.",

    "abstract": "Polyolefins derived from plastic wastes are recalcitrant for biological upcycling. However, chemical depolymerization of polyolefins can generate depolymerized plastic (DP) oil comprising of a complex mixture of saturated, unsaturated, even and odd hydrocarbons suitable for biological conversion. While DP oil contains a rich carbon and energy source, it is inhibitory to cells. Understanding and harnessing robust metabolic capabilities of microorganisms to upcycle the hydrocarbons in DP oil, both naturally and unnaturally occurring, into high-value chemicals are limited. Here, we discovered that an oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica undergoing short-term adaptation to DP oil robustly utilized a wide range of hydrocarbons for cell growth and production of citric acid and neutral lipids. When growing on hydrocarbons, Y. lipolytica partitioned into planktonic and oil-bound cells with each exhibiting distinct proteomes and amino acid distributions invested into establishing these proteomes. Significant proteome reallocation towards energy and lipid metabolism, belonging to two of the 23 KOG (Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups) classes C and I, enabled robust growth of Y. lipolytica on hydrocarbons, with n-hexadecane as the preferential substrate. This investment was even higher for growth on DP oil where both the KOG classes C and I were the top two, and many associated proteins and pathways were expressed and upregulated including the hydrocarbon degradation pathway, Krebs cycle, glyoxylate shunt and, unexpectedly, propionate metabolism. However, a reduction in proteome allocation for protein biosynthesis, at the expense of the observed increase towards energy and lipid metabolisms, might have caused the inhibitory effect of DP oil on cell growth.\n\nMPORTANCESustainable processes for biological upcycling plastic wastes in a circular bioeconomy are needed to promote decarbonization and reduce environmental pollution due to increased plastic consumption, incineration, and landfill storage. Strain characterization and proteomic analysis revealed the robust metabolic capabilities of Y. lipolytica to upcycle polyethylene into high-value chemicals. Significant proteome reallocation towards energy and lipid metabolisms was required for robust growth on hydrocarbons with n-hexadecane as the preferential substrate. However, an apparent over-investment in these same categories to utilize complex DP oil came at the expense of protein biosynthesis, limiting cell growth. Taken together, this study elucidates how Y. lipolytica activates its metabolism to utilize DP oil and establishes Y. lipolytica as a promising host for the upcycling of plastic wastes.",

The response involves several physiological changes, such as releasing of glucocorticoids and catecholamines, to restore homeostasis. Due the lack of knowledge on this subject in wild birds, the objective of the present work was study the effect of heat stress on body condition and digestive system in house sparrows (Passer domesticus), as well as a possible role of capsaicin as a dietary additive in mitigating heat stress. In this work, we measure heterophils/lymphocytes ratio (as proxy of stress), body mass, hematocrit, uric acid and digestive enzymes (intestinal and pancreatic) under stress conditions at 32{degrees}{+/-}2 {degrees}C and under normal conditions at 22{degrees}{+/-}2 {degrees}C. In addition, we evaluate the effect of capsaicin in both situations (heat stress at 32{degrees}C and normal condition 22{degrees}C). We found an increase of H/L ratio and uric acid in plasma under heat stress, and decrease of H/L ratio with capsaicin on animals exposed to heat stress. Although a loss of intestinal mass was observed in animals exposed at 32{degrees}C, digestive enzyme activity does not change under heat stress or under capsaicin administration. Improving knowledge in this field is relevant at the level of animal nutrition and veterinary medicine, reducing the stress of wild birds in captivity and improving dietary mixes for future global warming scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Reading entails transforming visual symbols to sound and meaning. This process depends on specialized circuitry in the visual cortex, the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA). Recent findings suggest that this word-selective cortex comprises at least two distinct subregions: the more posterior VWFA-1 is sensitive to visual features, while the more anterior VWFA-2 processes higher level language information. Here, we explore whether these two subregions exhibit different patterns of functional connectivity, and whether these patterns have relevance for reading development. We address these questions using two complementary datasets: Using the Natural Scenes Datasets (NSD; Allen et al, 2022) we identify word-selective responses in high-quality 7T individual adult data (N=8; 6 females), and investigate functional connectivity patterns of VWFA-1 and VWFA-2 at the individual level. We then turn to the Healthy Brain Network (HBN; Alexander et al., 2017) database to assess whether these patterns a) replicate in a large developmental sample (N=224; 98 females, age 5-21y), and b) are related to reading development. In both datasets, we find that VWFA-1 is more strongly correlated with bilateral visual regions including ventral occipitotemporal cortex and posterior parietal cortex. In contrast, VWFA-2 is more strongly correlated with language regions in the frontal and lateral parietal lobes, particularly bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Critically, these patterns do not generalize to adjacent face-selective regions, suggesting a unique relationship between VWFA-2 and the frontal language network. While connectivity patterns increased with age, no correlations were observed between functional connectivity and reading ability. Together, our findings support the distinction between subregions of the VWFA, and portray the functional connectivity patterns of the reading circuitry as an intrinsic stable property of the brain.",

    "abstract": "Protein ubiquitination is essential for cellular homeostasis and regulation of several processes, including cell division and genome integrity. Ubiquitin E3 ligases determine substrate specificity for ubiquitination, and Cullin-RING ubiquitin E3 Ligases (CRLs) make the largest group among the ubiquitin E3 ligases. Although conserved and most studied in model eukaryotes, CRLs remain underappreciated in Plasmodium and related parasites. To investigate the CRLs of human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, we generated parasites expressing tagged P. falciparum cullin-1 (PfCullin-1), cullin-2 (PfCullin-2), Rbx1 (PfRbx1) and Skp1 (PfSkp1). PfCullin-1 and PfCullin-2 were predominantly expressed in erythrocytic trophozoite and schizont stages, with nucleocytoplasmic localization and chromatin association, suggesting their roles in different cellular compartments and DNA-associated processes. Immunoprecipitation, in vitro protein-protein interaction and ubiquitination assay confirmed the presence of a functional SCF (PfSCF), comprising of PfCullin-1, PfRbx1, PfSkp1, PfFBXO1 and calcyclin binding protein. Immunoprecipitation, sequence analysis and ubiquitination assay indicated that PfCullin-2 forms a functional human CRL4-like complex (PfCRL4), consisting of PfRbx1, cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor subunit_A and WD40 repeat proteins. PfCullin-2 knock-down at the protein level, which would hinder PfCRL4 assembly, significantly decreased asexual and sexual erythrocytic stage development. Several pathways, including protein translation and folding, lipid biosynthesis and transport, DNA replication, and protein degradation were dysregulated upon PfCullin-2-depletion, which likely reflects association of PfCRL4 with multiple pathways. Consistent with dysregulation of multiple pathways, PfCullin-2-depleted schizonts had poorly delimited merozoites and internal membraned structures, suggesting a role of PfCRL4 in maintaining membrane integrity. PfCullin-2-depleted parasites had significantly lower number of nuclei/parasite than the normal parasites, indicating a crucial role of PfCRL4 in cell division. Taken together, we for the first time demonstrate the presence of functional CRLs in P. falciparum, with crucial roles for PfCRL4 in cell division and maintaining membrane integrity. This study will benefit investigation of similar ligases in related parasites.",
