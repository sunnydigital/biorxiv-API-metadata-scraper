    "abstract": "Interactions between species invasions and climate change have the potential to drive changes in plant communities more than either factor alone. One pathway through which these effects can occur is via changes to the rhizosphere microbial community. Invasive plants can alter the taxonomic and functional makeup of these microbial communities, which may affect natives abilities to compete with invaders. At the same time, climate change is leading to more frequent extreme wet and dry events, shifting the composition of microbial taxa available in the soil. Understanding the response of plant communities to these combined global change drivers requires a comprehensive approach that assesses the relationship between plant competition and belowground rhizosphere microbial community responses. Here we use a field experiment in a California grassland with a set of six native annual forbs (i.e., wildflowers) and three invasive annual grasses to test how competition with invasive plants alters both identity and function in the native rhizosphere microbiome, and whether competition between these groups interacts with rainfall to amplify or ameliorate these microbial shifts. Metagenomics of rhizosphere communities revealed that drought combined with competition from invaders altered a higher number of functions and families in the native rhizosphere compared to invasive competition alone or drought alone. This suggests invasion-driven shifts in the microbial community may be involved in weakening natives ability to cope with climate change, especially drought. Understanding the role of the microbial community under invasion and climate change may be critical to mitigating the negative effects of these interacting global change drivers on native communities.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the effect of fluctuations on populations is crucial in the context of increasing habitat fragmentation, climate change, and biological invasions, among others. Migration in response to environmental disturbances enables populations to escape unfavorable conditions, benefit from new environments and thereby ride out fluctuations in variable environments. Would populations disperse if there were no uncertainty? Karlin showed in 1982 that when sub-populations experience distinct but fixed growth rates at different sites, greater mixing of populations will lower the overall growth rate relative to the most favorable site. Here we ask, when might environmental variability favor migration over no-migration? Specifically, in random environments, would a small amount of migration increase the overall long-run growth rate relative to the zero migration case? We use mathematical analysis and simulations to show how long-run growth rate is affected by migration rate. Our results show that when fitness (dis)advantages fluctuate over time across sites, migration may allow populations to benefit from variability. When there is one best site with highest expected growth rate, the effect of migration on long-run growth rate depends on the difference in expected growth between sites, scaled by the variance of the difference (for two sites). When variance is large, there is a substantial probability of an inferior site experiencing occasional bursts of higher growth than its average. Thus, a high variance can compensate for a large difference in average growth rates between sites. With multiple sites and large fluctuations, we explore the interplay between the length of the shortest cycle linking the best site with the second best, the average differences in growth rates between sites, and the size of fluctuations. Our findings have implications for conservation biology: even when there are superior sites in a sea of poor habitats, variability and habitat quality across space may be key to determining the importance of migration.",

To prevent the introduction and spread of TiLV and its impact, there is an urgent need for increased surveillance, improved biosecurity measures, and continuous development of effective diagnostic and rapid sequencing methods. In this study, we have developed a multiplexed RT-PCR assay that can amplify all ten complete genomic segments of TiLV from various sources of isolation. The amplicons generated using this approach were immediately subjected to real-time sequencing on the Nanopore system. By using this approach, we have recovered and assembled 10 TiLV genomes from total RNA extracted from naturally TiLV-infected tilapia fish, concentrated tilapia rearing water, and cell culture. Our phylogenetic analysis, consisting of more than 36 TiLV genomes from both newly sequenced and publicly available TiLV genomes, provides new insights into the high genetic diversity of TiLV. This work is an essential steppingstone towards integrating rapid and real-time Nanopore-based amplicon sequencing into routine genomic surveillance of TiLV, as well as future vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "The potential infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in animals raises a public health and economic concern, particularly the high susceptibility of white-tailed deer (WTD) to SARS-CoV-2. The disparity in the disease outcome between humans and WTD is very intriguing, as the latter are often asymptomatic, subclinical carriers of SARS-CoV-2. To date, no studies have evaluated the innate immune factors responsible for the contrasting SARS-CoV-2-associated disease outcomes in these mammalian species. A comparative transcriptomic analysis in primary respiratory epithelial cells of human (HRECs) and WTD (Deer-RECs) infected with SARS-CoV-2 was assessed throughout 48 hours post inoculation (hpi). Both HRECs and Deer-RECs were susceptible to SARS-COV-2, with significantly (P < 0.001) lower virus replication in Deer-RECs. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEG) gradually increased in Deer-RECs but decreased in HRECs throughout the infection. The ingenuity pathway analysis of DEGs further identified that genes commonly altered during SARS-CoV-2 infection mainly belong to cytokine and chemokine response pathways mediated via IL-17 and NF-{kappa}B signaling pathways. Inhibition of the NF-{kappa}B signaling in the Deer-RECs pathway was predicted as early as 6 hpi. The findings from this study could explain the lack of clinical signs reported in WTD in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection as opposed to the severe clinical outcomes reported in humans.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIWhite-tailed deer primary respiratory epithelial cells are susceptible to SARS- CoV-2 without causing hyper cytokine gene expression.\nC_LIO_LIDownregulation of IL-17 and NF-{kappa}B signaling pathways after SARS-CoV-2 infection could be key to the regulated cytokine response in deer cells.\nC_LIO_LIDeer innate immune system could play a critical role in early antiviral and tissue repair response following SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Fluorogenic probes that unmask fluorescence signals in response to a bioorthogonal reaction are a powerful new addition to biological imaging. They can provide significantly reduced background fluorescence and minimize non-specific signals, potentially allowing real-time high-contrast imaging without washing out excess fluorophores. While diverse classes of highly refined synthetic fluorophores are readily available now, their integration into a bioorthogonal fluorogenic scheme still necessitates another level of extensive design efforts and customized structural alterations to optimize quenching mechanisms for each given fluorophore scaffold. Herein, we present an easy-to-implement and highly generalizable supramolecular  catch-and-release strategy for generating an efficient bioorthogonal fluorogenic response from essentially any readily available fluorophores without further structural alterations. We designed this distinct strategy based on the macrocyclic cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) host, where a fluorogenic response is achieved by programming a guest displacement reaction from the macrocycle cavity. We used this strategy to rapidly generate fluorogenic probes across the visible spectrum from structurally diverse classes of fluorophore scaffolds, including coumarin, bodipy, rhodamine, and cyanine. These probes were applied to no-wash fluorogenic imaging of various target molecules in live cells and tissue with minimal background and no appreciable non-specific signal. Notably, the orthogonal reactivity profile of the system allowed us to pair this host-guest fluorogenic probe with the covalently clickable fluorogenic probe to achieve high-contrast super-resolution and multiplexed fluorogenic imaging in cells and tissue.",

Prototypical sensory expressions of disgust are triggered by bitter and other unappetizing tastes in human infants, non-human primates, and rodents. Disgust in mice has been quantified through the taste reactivity (TR) test. TR has been video recorded and counted manually to be quantified, requiring a significant amount of time and effort, however. Here we constructed the method to automatically count TR to assess both innate and learned disgust in mice using machine learning. We automatically tracked TR using DeepLabCut as the coordinates of the nose and both front and rear paws. The automated tracking data was split into test and training data, and the latter was combined with manually labeled data on whether or not a TR was present, and if so, which type of the TR was present. Then, a random forest classifier was constructed, and the performance of the classifier was evaluated in the test dataset. Throughout, the total numbers of disgust TRs predicted by the classifier were highly correlated with those counted manually. The present method will facilitate large-scale screening and long-term experiments that require counting numerous TR, which are challenging to conduct manually.",

    "abstract": "1.The development of aging is associated with the disruption of key cellular processes manifested as well-established hallmarks of aging. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) have no stable tertiary structure that provide them a power to be configurable hubs in signaling cascades and regulate many processes, potentially including those related to aging. There is a need to clarify the roles of IDPs/IDRs in aging. The dataset of 1624 aging-related proteins was collected from established aging databases and experimental studies. There is a noticeable presence of IDPs/IDRs, accounting for about 36% of the aging-related dataset, which is comparable to the disorder content of the whole human proteome (about 40%). A Gene Ontology analysis of the our Aging proteome reveals an abundance of IDPs/IDRs in one-third of aging-associated processes, especially in genome regulation. Signaling pathways associated with aging also contain IDPs/IDRs on different hierarchical levels. Protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that IDPs present in different clusters associated with different aging hallmarks. Protein cluster with IDPs enrichment and high liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) probability has \"nuclear\" localization and DNA-associated functions, related to aging hallmarks: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, stem cells exhaustion. Some IDPs related to aging with high LLPS propensity were identified as \"dangerous\" based on the prediction of their propensity to aggregation. Overall, our analyses indicate that IDPs/IDRs play significant roles in aging-associated processes, particularly in the regulation of DNA functioning. IDP aggregation, which can lead to loss-of-function and toxicity, could be critically harmful to the cell. A structure-based analysis of aging and the identification of proteins that are particularly susceptible to disturbances can enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of aging and open up new avenues for slowing it down.",

    "abstract": "The N-terminal tails of eukaryotic histones are frequently post-translationally modified. The role of these modifications in transcriptional regulation is well-documented. However, the extent to which the enzymatic process of histone post-translational modification itself contributes to metabolic regulation is less clear. Here we investigated the metabolic role of histone methylation using metabolomics, proteomics and RNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, primary tumour samples and healthy tissue samples. In cancer the transcription of histone methyltransferases was inversely correlated to the activity of NNMT, an enzyme previously characterised as a methyl sink that disposes of excess methyl groups carried by the universal methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM or AdoMet). In healthy tissues histone methylation was inversely correlated to the levels of an alternative methyl sink, PEMT. These associations affected the levels of multiple histone marks on chromatin genome-wide but had no detectable impact on transcriptional regulation. We show that histone methyltransferases with a variety of different associations to transcription are co-regulated by the Retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour suppressor in human cells. Total HMT expression is increased in Rb-mutant cancers, and this leads to NNMT downregulation. Together, our results suggest a direct metabolic role for histone methylation in SAM homeostasis, independent of transcriptional regulation.",

Motivated by this challenge, we developed a statistical method, scDEED, for detecting dubious cell embeddings output by any 2D embedding method. By calculating a reliability score for every cell embedding, scDEED identifies the cell embeddings with low reliability scores as dubious and those with high reliability scores as trustworthy. Moreover, by minimizing the number of dubious cell embeddings, scDEED provides intuitive guidance for optimizing the hyperparameters of an embedding method.

    "abstract": "Natural products have successfully treated several diseases using a multi-component, multi-target mechanism. However, a precise mechanism of action has not been identified. Systems pharmacology methods have been used to overcome these challenges. However, there is a limitation as those similar mechanisms of similar components cannot be identified. In this study, comparisons of physicochemical descriptors, large-scale molecular docking analysis, and RNA-seq analysis were performed to compare the mechanisms of action of similar compounds and to confirm the changes observed when similar compounds were mixed and used. We propose an advanced method for in silico experiments in herbal medicine research based on the results. First, physicochemical descriptors were calculated based on the chemical structures of oleanolic acid (OA), hederagenin (HG), and gallic acid (GA). Similarities were confirmed by calculating the Euclidean, cosine, and Tanimoto distances between the descriptors. Next, the mechanisms of action of OA, HG, and GA were compared and confirmed through in silico-based systems pharmacology analysis using the BATMAN-TCM platform. The proteins interacting with the three compounds were verified through large-scale molecular docking analysis using the druggable proteome. Finally, a drug response transcriptome study was performed using OA, HG, GA, and a combination of OA and HG (COH) with similar structures.A comparison of physicochemical descriptors confirmed that OA and HG were very close. In particular, the two compounds showed a concordance rate of > 99% at cosine and Tanimoto distances. The systems pharmacology analysis results confirmed that OA and HG shared more than 86% of their predicted target proteins and differed only in GA. Systems pharmacology analysis revealed that OA and HG share the mechanisms of cardiac muscle contraction, oxidative phosphorylation, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In a molecular docking analysis of the 50 major druggable proteins, OA and HG shared 38 proteins, while GA shared a few with proteins derived from the other two compounds. In addition, OA and HG were confirmed to act on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cholinergic synapses, and calcium signaling pathways, and docking analysis visualization confirmed that the two components interact at the same site. RNA-seq analysis also showed that the differentially expressed genes and pathways derived from OA and HG were similar, and it was confirmed that COH had similar results to OA and HG. Our study has three novel findings. First, an advanced network pharmacology research method was suggested by partially presenting a solution to the difficulty in identifying multicomponent mechanisms. Second, a new natural product analysis method was proposed using large-scale molecular docking analysis. Finally, various biological data and analysis methods were used, such as in silico system pharmacology, docking analysis, and drug response RNA-seq. The results of this study are meaningful in that they suggest an analysis strategy that can improve existing systems pharmacology research analysis methods by showing that natural product-derived compounds with the same scaffold have the same mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Schizosaccharomyces pombe Clr6S, a class I histone deacetylase complex, functions as a zinc-dependent enzyme to remove acetyl groups from lysine residues in histone tails. We report here the cryo-EM structures of Clr6S alone and in a complex with a nucleosome. The active center, revealed at near atomic resolution, includes features important for catalysis - a water molecule coordinated by zinc, the likely nucleophile for attack on the acetyl-lysine bond, and a loop that may position the substrate for catalysis. The cryo-EM map in the presence of a nucleosome reveals multiple Clr6S-nucleosome contacts, and a high degree of relative motion of Clr6S and the nucleosome. Such flexibility may be attributed to interaction at a site in the flexible histone tail, and is likely important for function of the deacetylase, which acts at multiple sites in other histone tails.",

    "abstract": "The Brownian dynamics (BD) simulation technique is widely used to model the diffusive and conformational dynamics of complex systems comprising biological macromolecules. For the diffusive properties of macromolecules to be described correctly by BD simulations, it is necessary to include hydrodynamic interactions (HI). When modeled at the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) level of theory, for example, the translational and rotational diffusion coefficients of isolated macromolecules can be accurately reproduced; when HIs are neglected, however, diffusion coefficients can be underestimated by an order of magnitude or more. The principal drawback to the inclusion of HIs in BD simulations is their computational expense, and several previous studies have sought to accelerate their modeling by developing fast approximations for the calculation of the correlated random displacements. Here we explore the use of an alternative way to accelerate calculation of HIs, i.e., by replacing the full RPY tensor with an orientationally averaged (OA) version which retains the distance dependence of the HIs but averages out their orientational dependence. We seek here to determine whether such an approximation can be justified in application to the modeling of typical proteins and RNAs. We show that the use of an OA RPY tensor allows translational diffusion of macromolecules to be modeled with very high accuracy at the cost of rotational diffusion being underestimated by [~]25%. We show that this finding is independent of the type of macromolecule simulated and the level of structural resolution employed in the models. We also show, however, that these results are critically dependent on the inclusion of a non-zero term that describes the divergence of the diffusion tensor: when this term is omitted from simulations that use the OA RPY model, unfolded macromolecules undergo rapid collapse. Our results indicate that the orientationally averaged RPY tensor is likely to be a useful, fast approximate way of including HIs in BD simulations of intermediate-scale systems.",

    "abstract": "T lymphocyte acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is frequently associated with increased expression of the E protein transcription factor inhibitors TAL1 and LYL1. In mouse models, ectopic expression of Tal1 or Lyl1 in T cell progenitors or inactivation of E2a, is sufficient to predispose mice to develop T-ALL. How E2a suppresses thymocyte transformation is currently unknown. Here, we show that early deletion of E2a, prior to the DN3 stage, was required for robust leukemogenesis and was associated with alterations in thymus cellularity, T cell differentiation, and gene expression in immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Introduction of wild-type thymocytes into mice with early deletion of E2a prevented leukemogenesis, or delayed disease onset, and impacted the expression of multiple genes associated with transformation and genome instability. Our data indicate that E2a suppresses leukemogenesis by promoting T cell development and enforcing inter-thymocyte competition, a mechanism that is emerging as a safeguard against thymocyte transformation. These studies have implications for understanding how multiple essential regulators of T cell development suppress T-ALL and support the hypothesis that thymus cellularity is a determinant of leukemogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Opioid use in the United States and abroad is an endemic part of culture with yearly increases in overdose rates and deaths. As rates of overdose incidence increases, the use of the safe and effective reversal agent, naloxone, in the form of a nasal rescue spray is being fielded and used by emergency medical technicians (EMTs) at a greater and greater rate. Despite advances in deployment of these rescue products, deaths are continuing to increase. There is evidence that repeated dosing of a naloxone nasal spray (such as Narcan) is becoming more common due to the amount and type of opiate being abused. Despite the benefits of naloxone related to opioid reversals, we lack repeated dosing guidelines as a function of opiate and amount the patient has taken. Goal directed dosing is promising, where respiratory markers are being used as an indication of the patient recovery but require time and understanding by the EMT. We construct a whole-body model of the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of an opiate, fentanyl on respiratory depression. We then construct a model of nasal deposition and administration of naloxone to investigate repeat dosing requirements for large overdoses. We demonstrate that naloxone is highly effective at reversing respiratory symptoms of the patient and recommend dosing requirements as a function of opiate amount administered. By designing the model to include circulation and respiration we investigate physiological markers that may be used in goal directed therapy rescue treatments.",

    "abstract": "Leaf senescence is an essential physiological process related to grain yield potential and nutritional quality. Green leaf duration (GLD) after anthesis directly reflects the leaf senescence process and exhibits large genotypic differences in common wheat; however, the underlying gene regulatory mechanism is still lacking up to now. Here, we report TaNAM-A1 as the causal gene of major loci qGLD-6A for GLD during grain filling by map-based cloning. The role of TaNAM-A1 in regulating leaf senescence, spike length, and grain size was proved by transgenic assay and TILLING mutants analyses. Furthermore, the functional divergences among TaNAM-A1 three haplotypes were systematically evaluated. Wheat varieties with TaNAM-A1d (containing two mutations in CDS of TaNAM-A1) had longer GLD and advantages in yield-related traits than those with the wild type TaNAM-A1a. All three haplotypes were functional in transactivating the expression of genes involved in macromolecular degradation and mineral nutrient remobilization, with TaNAM-A1a the strongest activity and TaNAM-A1d the weakest. TaNAM-A1 modulates the expression of TaNAC016-3A and TaNAC-S-7A to trigger senescence initiation. TaNAC016-3A enhances TaNAM-A1 transcriptional activation ability by protein-protein interaction. Our study provides new insights into fine-tuning the leaf functional period and grain yield formation for wheat breeding under different geographical climatic conditions.",

    "abstract": "NR4A3 is a transcription factor that is rapidly induced in CD8+ T cells following antigenic recognition. We have previously shown that NR4A3 deficiency induces an early molecular program that promotes memory generation and enhances effector functions, which are two essential attributes for the success of adoptive cell therapy (ACT). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that Nr4a3-/- CD8+ T cells would have outstanding efficacy in ACT of cancer. Our results show that ACT of melanoma-bearing mice with Nr4a3-/- effector CD8+ T cells provides a better tumor control than their wild-type counterpart. The therapeutic effect observed with Nr4a3-/- effector CD8+ T cells is even better than the one observed with ACT of Nr4a3+/+ effector CD8+ T cells in combination with anti-PD-L1 treatment. scRNA-seq analysis reveals a huge heterogeneity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) states following ACT. The better tumor control observed with ACT of Nr4a3-/- CD8+ effectors without anti-PD-L1 treatment correlates with an enrichment of TILs within the clusters that are associated with the anti-PD-L1 response of wild-type TILs. Moreover, the clusters that are enriched in Nr4a3-/- TILs are the ones that are enriched for effector functions. Furthermore, Nr4a3-/- and Nr4a3+/+ effectors generate distinct progenitor populations. Pseudotime analysis suggests that these progenitors have different differentiation trajectories, which may explain why ACT with Nr4a3-/- effectors is more efficient. Therefore, modulation of NR4A3 activity may represent a new strategy to generate long-lived and highly functional T cells for ACT.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 caused a large-scale global pandemic between 2020 and 2022. Despite efforts to understand its biology and mechanisms of pathogenicity, the viral impact on the neurological systems remains unclear. The main goal of this study was to quantify the neurological phenotypes induced by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in neurons, measured by in-vitro multi-well micro-electrode arrays (MEAs). We extracted the whole-brain neurons from the newborn P1 mice and plated them on multi-well micro-electrode arrays and administered purified recombinant spike proteins (S1 and S2 subunits respectively) from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The signals from the MEAs were transmitted from an amplifier to a high-performance computer for recording and analysis. We used an in-house developed algorithm to quantify neuronal phenotypes. Among all the phenotypic features analyzed, we discovered that the S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 decreased the mean burst numbers observed on each electrode; This effect was not observed for the spike 2 protein (S2) and could be rescued by an anti-S1 antibody. Finally, our data strongly suggest that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S1 is responsible for the reduction of burst activities in neurons. Overall, our results strongly indicate that spike proteins may play an important role in altering neuronal phenotypes, specifically the burst patterns, when neurons are exposed during early development.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin B12 (B12), an essential cofactor in all domains of life, is produced de novo by only a small subset of prokaryotes, but B12-sensing riboswitches are some of the most widely distributed riboswitches in bacteria. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of the ongoing tuberculosis pandemic, encodes two distinct vitamin B12 riboswitches. One controls the expression of metE, encoding a B12-independent methionine synthase, while the other is located upstream of ppe2, a PE/PPE family gene whose function is still unresolved. Here, we analyse ligand sensing, secondary structure architecture, and gene expression control mechanisms of these two riboswitches. Our results provide the first evidence of direct ligand binding by metE and ppe2 riboswitches and show that the two switches exhibit different preferences for natural isoforms of B12, use distinct regulatory and structural elements, and act as translational OFF switches. Based on our results, we propose that the ppe2 switch represents a new Class IIc of B12-sensing riboswitches. Moreover, we have identified small translated open reading frames (uORFs) upstream of both metE and ppe2, which modulate the expression of the respective downstream genes in opposite directions. Translation of the metE riboswitch uORF suppresses MetE expression, while translation of the uORF in the ppe2 switch is essential for PPE2 expression via the synthesis of a uORF-PPE2 fusion protein. In summary, our findings reveal an unexpected diversity and complexity of B12-dependent cis-regulation in M. tuberculosis, with potential implications for host-pathogen interactions.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of HIV-1 in a host is shaped by many evolutionary forces, including recombination of virus genomes and the potential isolation of viruses into different tissues with compartmentalized evolution. Recombination and compartmentalization have opposite effects on viral diversification, with the former causing global mixing and the latter countering it through spatial segregation of the virus population. Therefore, recombination and compartmentalization together give rise to complex evolutionary dynamics that convolutes their individual effects in standard, bifurcating phylogenetic trees. Although there are various theoretical methods available to infer the presence of recombination or compartmentalization individually, there is little knowledge of their combined effect. To study their interaction and whether that could explain the many disparate results that have been described in the HIV-1 literature, we developed an age-structured forward-time evolutionary model that includes compartments, migration, and recombination. By tracking the evolutionary history of individual virus variants in an Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG) and resolving the ARG into standard bifurcating trees, we reexamined 771 anatomical tissue pairs infected with HIV-1. Remarkably, we found that recombination can make the resulting bifurcating tree appear more compartmentalized than the virus population actually is. However, we found migration between all 771 tissue pairs, typically at 2.8-4.9x10-3 taxa-1 day-1. Thus, while different point mutations may arise in different parts of the body, migration eventually brings these variants together and recombination merges them into a relatively homogeneous cloud of a universally evolving quasispecies. Modelling this process, we explain the many different results previous research found among distinct anatomical tissues. We also show that the popular Slatkin-Maddison test comes to different results about compartmentalization at the same migration rate depending on the sample size.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEWhether HIV-1 sampled in different anatomical tissues are compartmentalized or not has been a long-standing quest because it relates to both clinical and biological insight. Previous studies of this question have reported disparate results from the same as well as different tissue comparisons. Here, we consolidate and explain these contrasting results with a new evolutionary model that includes compartments, migration, and recombination. We show that no anatomical tissues are fully compartmentalized, and that the migration of HIV-1 between the tissues allows recombination to homogenize the diversity that may arise in separate tissues of an infected person.",

    "abstract": "The ability to sense and respond to proteotoxic insults declines with age, leaving cells vulnerable to chronic and acute stressors. Reproductive cues modulate this decline in cellular proteostasis to influence organismal stress resilience in C. elegans. We previously uncovered a pathway that links the integrity of developing embryos to somatic health in reproductive adults. Here, we show that the nuclear receptor NHR-49, a functional homolog of mammalian peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR), regulates stress resilience and proteostasis downstream of embryo integrity and other pathways that influence lipid homeostasis, and upstream of HSF-1. Disruption of the vitelline layer of the embryo envelope, which activates a proteostasis-enhancing inter-tissue pathway in somatic tissues, also triggers changes in lipid catabolism gene expression that are accompanied by an increase in fat stores. NHR-49 together with its co-activator MDT-15 contributes to this remodeling of lipid metabolism and is also important for the elevated stress resilience mediated by inhibition of the embryonic vitelline layer as well as by other pathways known to change lipid homeostasis, including reduced insulin-like signaling and fasting. Further, we show that increased NHR-49 activity is sufficient to suppress polyglutamine aggregation and improve stress resilience in an HSF-1-dependent manner. Together, our results establish NHR-49 as a key regulator that links lipid homeostasis and cellular resilience to proteotoxic stress.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to several antibiotics against Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a serious problem to be solved worldwide. In the present work, we made the statistical analysis of the gene regulatory network of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-macrophage interactome to find the probable cause of this resistance. The results from this analysis show that both the gene regulatory network and the interactoma have a hierarchical free scale modular structure that assures a high degree of resilience of these networks against external perturbations. In particular, the interactome is a complex hybrid network that results from the formation of novel links between the Mycobacterium tuberculosis and macrophage proteins and from the modification of the previously existing links between the native macrophage proteins, which give rise to novel negative and positive feedback loops that modify the dynamical behavior of the interactome and protect the mycobacterium against the attack with antibiotics by taking control of the macrophage immune response and apoptosis. The statistical analysis of the interactome shows that the highly connected mycobacterium proteins inhA, ahpC, kasA, katG and rpsL exert this control by creating new links with the host proteins FAS and NF-{kappa}B. These new hybrid circuits embedded in the hierarchical scale-free modular molecular structure of the interactome produce its high resistance to external perturbations like antibiotics. As consequence, the present work proposes the hypothesis that Mycobacterium tuberculosis antibiotic resistance in vivo during chronic tuberculosis is only a particular case of a more complex problem that is the interactome resilience against antibiotics. Thus, new strategies of drug design are necessary to shatter the complex structure of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-macrophage interactome.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining tissue homeostasis requires proper regulation of stem cell differentiation. The Waddington landscape suggests that gene circuits in a cell form a potential landscape of different cell types, with cells developing into different cell types following attractors of the probability landscape. However, it remains unclear how adult stem cells balance the trade-off between self-renewal and differentiation. We propose that random inheritance of epigenetic states plays a crucial role in stem cell differentiation and develop a hybrid model of stem cell differentiation induced by epigenetic modifications. Our model integrates a gene regulation network, epigenetic state inheritance, and cell regeneration to form multi-scale dynamics ranging from transcription regulation to cell population. Our simulation investigates how random inheritance of epigenetic states during cell division can automatically induce cell differentiation, dedifferentiation, and transdifferentiation. We show that interfering with epigenetic modifications or introducing extra transcription factors can regulate the probabilities of dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation, revealing the mechanism of cell reprogramming. This in silico model offers insights into the mechanism of stem cell differentiation and cell reprogramming.",

    "abstract": "Paraneoplastic syndromes occur in cancer patients and originate from dysfunction of organs at a distance from the tumor or its metastasis. A wide range of organs can be affected in paraneoplastic syndromes; however, the pathological mechanisms by which tumors influence host organs are poorly understood. Recent studies in the fly uncovered that tumor secreted factors target host organs, leading to pathological effects. In this study, using a Drosophila gut tumor model, we characterized a mechanism of tumor-induced kidney dysfunction. Specifically, we found that Pvf1, a PDGF/VEGF signaling ligand, secreted by gut tumors activates the PvR/JNK/Jra signaling pathway in the principal cells of the kidney, leading to mis-expression of renal genes and paraneoplastic renal syndrome-like phenotypes. Our study describes a novel mechanism by which gut tumors perturb the function of the kidney, which might be of clinical relevance for the treatment of paraneoplastic syndromes.",

    "abstract": "Mixed infections caused by multiple pathogenic and/ weakly pathogenic strains inhabiting the same host plants are common in nature and may modify pathogen dynamics. However, traditional plant pathogen studies have mostly focused on the binary interaction between a single host and a single pathogen. In this study, we have looked beyond this binary interaction and evaluated the impact of co-infection on disease dynamics on tomato using bacterial spot pathogen, Xanthomonas perforans (Xp) and two co-occurring weakly pathogenic strains of X. arboricola (Xa) and Pseudomonas capsici (Pc). Time-series greenhouse co-infection experiments monitoring disease severity and within-host population dynamics revealed higher disease severity in co-infection by three species compared to infection by Xp alone. However, co-infection by dual species, Xp and Pc or Xa resulted in lower disease severity compared to Xp alone. Thus, co-infection outcomes depend on interacting species. Weak pathogens could exploit Xp to colonize the host plant as indicated by their higher populations in co-infection. However, Xp population dynamics was dependent on co-infecting partner. While resource competition might be a possible explanation for lower Xp population in dual co-infection, interaction of Pc with the host was found to influence Xp population. Interestingly, Xp population was higher in presence of three-species interaction compared to Xp and Xa co-infection, suggesting potential modulation of co-operative interactions among Xp and Xa in three-species co-infection rather than competitive interactions. Humidity played a significant role in population dynamics of the three species. Overall, this study highlighted importance of co-infection dynamics in studying plant disease outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Organoid transplantation has a promising future in the treatment of liver disease, but a major limitation is the lack of guidance on the most appropriate method for transplantation that maximises organoid survival. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived liver progenitor cell organoids were transplanted into four different transplantation sites in a mouse model of liver disease, using five organoid delivery methods. Organoids were transplanted into the vascularised chamber device established in the groin, or into the liver, spleen, and subcutaneous fat. For organoid transplantations into the liver, organoids were delivered either in Matrigel alone, or in Matrigel and a polyurethane scaffold. At 2 weeks post-transplantation, the vascularised chamber had the highest organoid survival, which was 5.1x higher than the site with second highest survival (p=0.0002), being the intra-hepatic scaffold approach. No organoid survival was observed when delivered into the liver without a scaffold, or when injected into the spleen. Very low survival occurred in transplantations into subcutaneous fat. Animals with the vascularised chamber also had the highest levels of human albumin (0.33 {+/-} 0.09 ng/mL). This study provides strong evidence supporting the use of the vascularised chamber for future liver organoid transplantation studies, including its translation into clinical therapy.",

    "abstract": "Electrical synapses are essential components of neural circuits. Dysfunction of electrical synapses can lead to obstacles in learning and memory. Neural signal transduction across electrical synapses is primarily mediated by a gap junction channel, Connexin 36 (Cx36), the lack of which causes impaired electrical couplings in cortical interneurons and thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) neurons. Unique characteristics of Cx36 gap junction channel include its insensitivity in transjunctional membrane potential, as well as its preference for homomeric assembly, prone to exclude other paralogous connexins from co-assembly. However, the structural basis underlying Cx36 function and assembly remains elusive. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of human Cx36 at 2.67 [A] resolution and identified critical residues underpinning its obligatory homomeric assembly. In particular, we found non-canonical electrostatic interactions between protomers from opposing hemichannels and a steric complementary site between adjacent protomers within a hemichannel, which together offer a structural explanation for the assembly specificity in homomeric and heteromeric gap junction channels. Moreover, the narrowest restriction along the channel axis overlaps with an acidic patch, where Glu43, Asp47 and Asp48 may contribute to cation-selectivity. Also, the amino-terminal helix reported to be responsible for sensing membrane potential in other connexins was disordered in our Cx36 structure, in line with its channel activity independent of membrane potential. Together, this work elucidated the assembly mechanisms of the electrical synaptic gap junction channel, and offered possible explanations for sustained Cx36 activity upon membrane depolarization, which allows efficient action potential propagation across electrical synapses.",

    "abstract": "Macroautophagy is known for long as essential for the degradation and the recycling of different macromolecules in eukaryotes. However how important is autophagy for nitrogen management at the whole plant level and for plant biomass and yield productivity in unstressed and well feed plants needed further investigation. In this study, we used both autophagy knock-out mutants and autophagy over-expressors that constitutively produce numerous autophagosomes. These mutants and over-expressors were cultivated using hydroponic system to observe and compare their phenotypes under sufficient nitrate supply, and when submitted after a while to strict nitrate starvation. The shift from nitrate sufficient condition to nitrate starvation allowed us to determine how autophagy defective or stimulated lines can use their own nitrogen resources to complete their cycle. Unexpectedly we observed that irrespective of the nitrate conditions, both mutants and over-expressors exhibited early leaf senescence phenotypes relative to wild type. While autophagy mutants exhibited strong defect for N remobilisation and seed production irrespective of nitrate condition, the better performance of autophagy-over expressors for N remobilisation and seeds production was only significant under sufficient nitrate supply, i.e. when autophagy was not naturally stimulated by nitrate limitation. Interestingly, comparisons of genotypes showed that the nitrogen pool used for seed filling originated from rosette leaves, as if rosette and seeds were used as communicating vessels independently of the stem and pod connecting organs. Altogether, results show that autophagy is a master player in nitrogen management at the whole plant level that controls yield production and leaf senescence.",

    "abstract": "Human genome sequencing studies have identified numerous loci associated with complex diseases. However, translating human genetic and genomic findings to disease pathobiology and therapeutic discovery remains a major challenge at multiscale interactome network levels. Here, we present a deep-learning-based ensemble framework, termed PIONEER (Protein-protein InteractiOn iNtErfacE pRediction), that accurately predicts protein binding partner-specific interfaces for all protein interactions in humans and seven other common model organisms. We demonstrate that PIONEER outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. We further systematically validated PIONEER predictions experimentally through generating 2,395 mutations and testing their impact on 6,754 mutation-interaction pairs, confirming PIONEER-predicted interfaces are comparable in accuracy as experimentally determined interfaces using PDB co-complex structures. We show that disease-associated mutations are enriched in PIONEER-predicted protein-protein interfaces after mapping mutations from [~]60,000 germline exomes and [~]36,000 somatic genomes. We identify 586 significant protein-protein interactions (PPIs) enriched with PIONEER-predicted interface somatic mutations (termed oncoPPIs) from pan-cancer analysis of [~]11,000 tumor whole-exomes across 33 cancer types. We show that PIONEER-predicted oncoPPIs are significantly associated with patient survival and drug responses from both cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft mouse models. We identify a landscape of PPI-perturbing tumor alleles upon ubiquitination by E3 ligases, and we experimentally validate the tumorigenic KEAP1-NRF2 interface mutation p.Thr80Lys in non-small cell lung cancer. We show that PIONEER-predicted PPI-perturbing alleles alter protein abundance and correlates with drug responses and patient survival in colon and uterine cancers as demonstrated by proteogenomic data from the National Cancer Institutes Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium. PIONEER, implemented as both a web server platform and a software package, identifies functional consequences of disease-associated alleles and offers a deep learning tool for precision medicine at multiscale interactome network levels.",

However, the rapid accumulation of transcriptome datasets in these species represents an opportunity to explore underutilized network aggregation approaches that highlight robust co-expression interactions and improve functional connectivity. We applied and evaluated two different aggregation methods on public grapevine RNA- Seq datasets belonging to three different tissue conditions (leaf, berry and  all organs). Our results show that co-occurrence-based aggregation generally yielded the best-performing networks. We applied GCNs to study several TF gene families, showing its capacity of detecting both already-described and novel regulatory relationships between R2R3-MYBs, bHLH/MYC and multiple secondary metabolism pathway reactions. Specifically, TF gene-and pathway-centered network analyses successfully ascertained the previously established role of VviMYBPA1 in controlling the accumulation of proanthocyanidins while providing insights into its novel role as a regulator of p-coumaroyl-CoA biosynthesis as well as the shikimate and aromatic amino-acid pathways. This network was validated using DNA Affinity Purification Sequencing data, demonstrating that co-expression networks of transcriptional activators can serve as a proxy of gene regulatory networks.

    "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS), caused by human chromosome 21 trisomy, is one of the most common genetic causes of intellectual disabilities. Moreover, approximately 60-80% of individuals with Down Syndrome develop early onset Alzheimers disease symptoms and neuropathology characterized by the deposition of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Spine loss and synaptic deficits are the main alterations present in both pathologies. The synaptic proteins that are altered in both pathologies have also been studied. However, a proteomic study comparing synaptic fractions from DS and AD patients is lacking. To address this aim, we optimized a biochemical subfractioning method to isolate postsynaptic fractions from the cortex of Ts65Dn Down syndrome murine model and the entorhinal cortex from AD subjects samples. These samples were used for further proteomic analysis to observe potential alterations in postsynaptic protein expression and protein-protein interaction networks. This study compared the Ts65Dn animal model and entorhinal cortex of AD subjects and revealed a common altered postsynaptic composition of the adult Ts65Dn mouse cortex and entorhinal cortex of AD subjects. These postsynaptic protein alterations might functionally underlie Ts65Dn-associated and AD-associated dendritic deterioration, microtubule organization, glutamatergic transmission, and phosphorylation alterations. They provide insight into the possible common pathological synaptic mechanisms of both diseases and the earliest stages of AD disease progression. Moreover, our proteomic data suggest potential drug targets for modulating the commonly altered postsynaptic mechanisms in DS and AD.",

In this work, we tested for trans-generational immune priming in adult offspring of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, after maternal challenge with 10 different bacterial pathogens. We focused on natural opportunistic pathogens of Drosophila spanning a range of virulence from 10% to 100% host mortality. We infected mothers via septic injury and tested for enhanced resistance to infection in their adult offspring, measured as the ability to suppress bacterial proliferation and survive infection. We categorized the mothers into four classes for each bacterium tested: those that survived infection, those that succumbed to infection, sterile-injury controls, and uninjured controls. We found no evidence for trans-generational priming by any class of mother in response to any of the bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Affinity maturation, the progressive increase in serum antibody affinity after vaccination, is an essential process that contributes to an effective humoral response against vaccines and infections. Germinal centres (GCs) are key for affinity maturation, as they are where B cells undergo somatic hypermutation of their immunoglobulin genes in the dark zone, before going through positive selection in the light zone via interactions with T follicular helper cells and follicular dendritic cells. In aged mice, affinity maturation has been shown to be impaired, but whether B cell-intrinsic factors contribute to this defect remains unclear. In this study, we show that B cells from aged B cell receptor transgenic mice are able to become GC B cells, which are capable of receiving positive selection signals to a similar extent as B cells from young adult mice. Consistent with this, ageing also does not impact the ability of B cells to undergo somatic hypermutation and acquire affinity-enhancing mutations. Together, this shows that there are no B cell-intrinsic defects in affinity maturation with age when the B cell receptor repertoire is constant.",

    "abstract": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a (re)emerging mosquito-borne pathogen impacting human and animal health. How RVFV spreads through a population depends on population-level interactions between hosts and vectors (e.g., vector-to-host ratio and biting preference) and also on potential differences in individual following virus exposure (e.g., transmission efficiencies from host to vector and vice versa). Here, we estimated the probability for RVFV to transmit to naive animals by experimentally exposing lambs to a bite of an infectious mosquito (the transmission efficiency) and assessed if and how RVFV infection subsequently developed in the exposed animal. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, previously infected via feeding on a viremic lamb, were used to expose naive lambs to the virus. Lambs were either exposed to 1-3 (low exposure) or 7-9 (high exposure) infectious mosquitoes. All lambs in the high exposure group became viremic and showed characteristic signs of Rift Valley fever within 2-4 days post exposure. In contrast, 3 out of 12 lambs in the low exposure group developed viremia and disease, with similar peaks in viremia as the high exposure group but with some heterogeneity in the onset of viremia. These results suggest that the likelihood for successful infection of a ruminant host is affected by the number of infectious mosquitoes biting, but also highlights that a lamb can be infected by a single mosquito. The per bite mosquito-to-host transmission efficiency was estimated at 28% (95% confidence interval: 15 - 47%). We subsequently combined this transmission efficiency with estimates for mosquito life traits into a Ross-McDonald mathematical model to illustrate scenarios under which major RVFV outbreaks could occur in naive populations (i.e., R0 >1). The model revealed that for efficient RVFV transmission relatively high vector-to-host ratios as well as strong feeding preference for competent hosts are required. Altogether, this study highlights the importance of experiments that mimic natural exposure to RVFV. The experiments facilitate a better understanding of the natural progression of disease and a direct way to obtain epidemiological parameters for mathematical models.",

The disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) which transmits through the bite of Ixodid ticks. Most cases treated soon after infection are resolved by a short course of oral antibiotics. However, 10-20% of patients experience chronic symptoms because of delayed or incomplete treatment, a condition called Post-Treatment Lyme Disease (PTLD). Some Bb persists in PTLD patients after the initial course of antibiotics and an effective treatment to eradicate the persistent Bb is needed. Other organisms that cause persistent infections, such as M. tuberculosis, are cleared using a combination of therapies rather than monotherapy. A group of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs efficacious against Bb were used in monotherapy or in combination in mice infected with Bb. Different methods of detection were used to assess the efficacy of the treatments in the infected mice including culture, xenodiagnosis, and molecular techniques. None of the monotherapies eradicated persistent Bb. However, 4 dual combinations (doxycycline + ceftriaxone, dapsone + rifampicin, dapsone + clofazimine, doxycycline + cefotaxime) and 3 triple combinations (doxycycline + ceftriaxone+ carbomycin, doxycycline + cefotaxime+ loratadine, dapsone+ rifampicin+ clofazimine) eradicated persistent Bb infections. These results suggest that combination therapy should be investigated in preclinical studies for treating human Lyme disease.",

    "abstract": "For many intracellular pathogens, their virulence depends on an ability to spread between cells of an epithelial layer. For intercellular spread to occur, these pathogens deform the plasma membrane into a protrusion structure that is engulfed by the neighboring cell. Although the polymerization of actin is essential for spread, how these pathogens manipulate the actin cytoskeleton in a manner that enables protrusion formation is still incompletely understood. Here, we identify the mammalian actin binding protein synaptopodin as required for efficient intercellular spread. Using a model cytosolic pathogen, Shigella flexneri, we show that synaptopodin contributes to organization of actin around bacteria and increases the length of the actin tail at the posterior pole of the bacteria. We show that synaptopodin presence enables protrusions to form and to resolve at a greater rate, indicating that greater stability of the actin tail enables the bacteria to push against the membrane with greater force. We demonstrate that synaptopodin recruitment around bacteria requires the bacterial protein IcsA, and we show that this recruitment is further enhanced in a type 3 secretion system dependent manner. These data establish synaptopodin as required for intracellular bacteria to reprogram the actin cytoskeleton in a manner that enables efficient protrusion formation and enhance our understanding of the cellular function of synaptopodin.\n\nAuthors SummaryIntercellular spread is essential for many cytosolic dwelling pathogens during their infectious life cycle. Despite knowing the steps required for intercellular spread, relatively little is known about the host-pathogen interactions that enable these steps to occur. Here, we identify a requirement for the actin binding protein synaptopodin during intercellular spread by cytosolic bacteria. We show synaptopodin is necessary for the stability and recruitment of polymerized actin around bacteria. We also demonstrate synaptopodin is necessary to form plasma membrane structures known as protrusions that are necessary for the movement of these bacteria between cells. Thus, these findings implicate synaptopodin as an important actin-binding protein for the virulence of intracellular pathogens that require the actin cytoskeleton for their spread between cells.",

    "abstract": "African swine fever (ASF) is an infectious disease characterized by hemorrhagic fever, highly pathogenic, and severe mortality in domestic pigs caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV). ASFV is a large DNA virus and primarily infects porcine monocyte macrophages. The interaction between ASFV and host macrophages is the major reason for gross pathological lesions caused by ASFV. Necroptosis is an inflammatory programmed cell death and plays an important immune role during virus infection. However, whether and how ASFV induces macrophage necroptosis and what effect of necroptosis signaling on host immunity and ASFV infection remains unknown. This study uncovered that ASFV activates the necroptosis signaling in the spleen, lung, liver, and kidney from ASFV-infected pigs. And macrophage necroptosis also was induced by ASFV infection in vitro. Further evidence showed that the macrophage necroptosis is independent of TNF--RIPK1 or TLR-TRIF pathway but depends on Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1). ASFV infection upregulates the expression of ZBP1 and RIPK3 to consist of the ZBP1-RIPK3-MLKL necrosome and further activates macrophage necroptosis. Subsequently, multiple Z-DNA sequences were predicted to be present in the ASFV genome. And the Z-DNA signals were further confirmed to be present and colocalized with ZBP1 in the cytoplasm and nucleus of ASFV-infected cells. Moreover, ZBP1-mediated macrophage necroptosis caused the extracellular release of proinflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-1{beta} induced by ASFV infection. Finally, we demonstrated that ZBP1-mediated necroptosis signaling significantly inhibits ASFV replication in host macrophages. Our findings uncovered a novel mechanism by which ASFV induces macrophage necroptosis by facilitating Z-DNA accumulation and ZBP1 necrosome assembly, providing significant insights into the pathogenesis of ASFV infection.\n\nImportanceASFV infection causes an acute, febrile, hemorrhagic, and severely lethal disease in swine, which seriously threatens the global porcine industry. Understanding the interaction mechanism between ASFV and host macrophages during infection is essential for elucidating the pathogenesis of ASFV. To our knowledge, this study revealed the interaction mechanism between ASFV infection and host macrophage necroptosis. The results showed that ASFV infection induces macrophage necroptosis through ZBP1 activation instead of the TNF--RIPK1 or TLR-TRIF pathway. ASFV infection promotes Z-DNA accumulation, which causes ZBP1-RIPK3-MLKL necrosome assembly and macrophage necroptosis. The ZBP1-mediated necroptosis signaling facilitates the extracellular release of proinflammatory cytokines, inhibiting ASFV replication in host macrophages. This study found a new interaction mechanism between ASFV and host macrophages, which may help understand the pathogenesis caused by ASFV infection.",

    "abstract": "Phage derived bacteriocins, also referred to as tailocins, are structures encoded by bacterial genomes and deployed into the extracellular environment to target and kill sensitive cells. Tailocins display great potential as agricultural antimicrobials due to their durability, efficiency, and specificity of killing with prophylactic application of these molecules having been shown to prevent infection by multiple phytopathogens. Although previous reports have strongly suggested that tailocins of Pseudomonas syringae bind sugar moieties in the lipopolysaccharide of target cells, the molecular mechanisms and binding interactions that enable tailocins from P. syringae to kill sensitive targets remain unclear. We therefore carried out a genome-wide association study investigating tailocin sensitivity across a diverse set of P. syringae genomes. Our results demonstrate that genes strongly correlated with tailocin sensitivity are localized to one contiguous region on the P. syringae chromosome encoding LPS structures similar to the Common Polysaccharide Antigen of P. aeruginosa. We further find that enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and transport of D-rhamnose and L-rhamnose are associated with tailocin sensitivity classes A and B, respectively, with large-scale recombination of the O-antigen biosynthesis region likely underlying rapid and fundamental changes in LPS structure between strains. Lastly, we identify the rfbD gene as an additional genomic indicator to predict tailocin sensitivity and use this information to test tailocin interactions with previously unscreened strains from across phylogroups.",

Most nematode sensory assays are performed by tallying observations of worm behavior on two-dimensional planes using agarose plates. These assays have been successful in the study of volatile sensation but are poorly suited for investigation of water-soluble gustation or parasitic nematodes without a free-living stage. In contrast, gustatory assays tend to be tedious, often limited to the manipulation of a single individual at a time. We have designed a nematode sensory assay using a microfluidics device that allows for the study of gustation in a 96-well, three-dimensional environment. This device is suited for free-living worms and parasitic worms that spend their lives in an aqueous environment, and we have used it to show that ivermectin inhibits the gustatory ability of vector-borne parasitic nematodes.",

    "abstract": "RNA-binding proteins play important roles in bacterial gene regulation through interactions with both coding and non-coding RNAs. ProQ is a FinO-domain protein that binds a large set of RNAs in Escherichia coli, though the details of how ProQ binds these RNAs remain unclear. In this study, we used a combination of in vivo and in vitro binding assays to confirm key structural features of E. coli ProQs FinO domain and explore its mechanism of RNA interactions. Using a bacterial three-hybrid assay, we performed forward genetic screens to confirm the importance of the concave face of ProQ in RNA binding. Using gel shift assays, we directly probed the contributions of ten amino acids on ProQ binding to seven RNA targets. Certain residues (R58, Y70, and R80) were found to be essential for binding of all seven RNAs, while substitutions of other residues (K54 and R62) caused more moderate binding defects. Interestingly, substitutions of two amino acids (K35, R69), which are evolutionarily variable but adjacent to conserved residues, showed varied effects on the binding of different RNAs; these may arise from the differing sequence context around each RNAs terminator hairpin. Together, this work confirms many of the essential RNA-binding residues in ProQ initially identified in vivo and supports a model in which residues on the conserved concave face of the FinO domain such as R58, Y70 and R80 form the main RNA-binding site of E. coli ProQ, while additional contacts contribute to the binding of certain RNAs.",

    "abstract": "Surface display co-opts yeasts innate ability to embellish its cell wall with mannoproteins, thus converting the yeasts outer surface into a growing and self-sustaining catalyst. However, the efficient toolbox for converting the enzyme of interest into its surface-displayed isoform is currently lacking, especially if the isoform needs to be anchored to the cell wall near the isoforms N-terminus. Aiming to advance such N-terminally anchored surface display, we employed in silico and machine-learning strategies to study the 3D structure, function, genomic organisation, and evolution of the Pir protein family, whose members evolved to covalently attach themselves near their N-terminus to the {beta}-1,3-glucan of the cell wall. Through the newly-gained insights, we rationally engineered 14 S. cerevisiae Hsp150 (Pir2)-based fusion proteins. We quantified their performance, uncovering guidelines for efficient yeast surface display while developing a construct that promoted a 2.5-fold more efficient display than the full-length Hsp150 and a Pir-tag, i.e., a peptide spanning only 4.5 kDa but promoting as efficient surface display as the full-length Hsp150. These constructs fortify the existing surface display toolbox, allowing for a prompt and routine refitting of any protein into its N-terminally anchored isoform.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=137 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/538238v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (60K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@909e7aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9480ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1945bdcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11ae505_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Although environmental RNA (eRNA) is emerging as a non-invasive tool to assess the health status of aquatic macro-organisms, the potential of eRNA remains largely untested. In this study, we investigated the ability of eRNA to detect changes in gene expression in Japanese medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) in response to sub-lethal pyrene exposure, as a model toxic chemical. We performed standardized acute toxicity tests and collected eRNA from tank water and RNA from fish tissue after 96 h of exposure. Our results showed that over 1000 genes were detected in eRNA and the sequenced read counts of these genes correlated with those in fish tissue (r = 0.50). Moreover, eRNA detected 86 differentially expressed genes in response to pyrene, some of which were shared by fish RNA, including suppression of collagen fiber genes. These results suggest that eRNA has the potential to detect changes in gene expression in fish in response to environmental stressors without the need for sacrificing or causing pain to fish. However, we also found that the majority of sequenced reads of eRNA (> 99%) were not mapped to the reference medaka genome and they originated from bacteria and fungi, resulting in low sequencing-depth. In addition, eRNA, in particular nuclear genes, was highly degraded with a median transcript integrity number (TIN) of < 20. These limitations highlight the need for future studies to improve the analytical methods of eRNA application.\n\nTOC Art\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=92 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/538202v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@98c437org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17a1f31org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@95d1e7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7a253_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Microinjection is a widely used technique for transgenesis, mutagenesis, cell labeling, cryopreservation, and in vitro fertilization in multiple single and multicellular organisms. Microinjection requires specialized skills acquired for each target organism and involves rate limiting and labor-intensive preparatory steps. Here we constructed a machine vision (MV) guided generalized robot that fully automates the process of microinjection in fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. The robot uses machine learning (ML) models trained to detect individual embryos in images of agar plates, and models trained to identify specific anatomical locations within each embryo in 3D space using dual view microscopes. The robot uses this information to serially perform microinjection in each detected embryo without any human intervention. We constructed and used three such robots to automatically microinject tens of thousands of Drosophila and zebrafish embryos. We systematically optimized robotic microinjection for each species and validated the use of the robot by performing routine transgenesis with proficiency comparable to highly skilled human practitioners while achieving up to 4x increases in microinjection throughput in Drosophila. The automated microinjection robot was utilized to microinject pools of over 20,000 uniquely barcoded plasmids into 1,713 embryos in two days to rapidly generate more than 400 unique transgenic Drosophila lines. This high throughput microinjection experiment enabled a novel measurement of the number of independent germline integration events per successfully injected embryo. Finally, we showed that robotic microinjection of cryoprotective agents in zebrafish embryos significantly improves vitrification rates and survival of cryopreserved embryos post-thaw as compared to manual microinjection, opening the tantalizing possibility of large-scale cryobanking of aquatic species at an industrial scale. We anticipate that this versatile automated microinjection system can be applied to carry out microinjection for genome-wide manipulation and cryopreservation at scale in a wide range of other organisms.",

Cohesin relocated to DNA motifs for various transcription factors, including PATZ1 and other zinc finger proteins (ZNFs). Moreover, PATZ1 and ZNFs co-localized with CTCF, MAZ, and cohesin with apparent overlapping specificity as dictated by the site to be insulated. Similar to CTCF and MAZ, PATZ1 interacted with RAD21. Patz1 KO mESCs exhibited altered global gene expression. While the absence of MAZ impacts anterior CTCF-boundaries as shown previously1, Patz1 KO led to derepression of posterior Hox genes, resulting in cervicothoracic transformation of motor neuron (MN) fate during differentiation. These findings point to a varied, combinatorial binding of known and newly defined accessory factors as being critical for positional identity and cellular fate determination during differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Pandrug-resistant (PDR) K. pneumoniae has been reported sporadically in many countries and remains rare in Brazil. The lack of genomic studies limits the comprehension of the determinants mostly involved with the PDR emergence in K. pneumoniae. This study aimed to unravel the main genetic determinants involved with the PDR background of a clinical ST11 K. pneumoniae recovered in the Brazilian Amazon region. The carbapenem-resistant Kp196 was submitted to WGS and its intrinsic and acquired resistome was assessed by CARD and comparison with wild-type genes. Kp196 resistome was composed of acquired resistance determinants and mutations in chromosomal genes. Among the formers, blaCTX-M-15 and blaNDM-1, blaOXA-9, blaOXA-1, aadA1, aacA4, strAB, aph(3)-VI, aac(3)-IId, qnrS1, qnrB1, oqxAB, dfrA14, sul2, catB3 were found in the vicinity of mobile genetic elements, which could contribute to their spread. Kp196 colistin resistance was multifactorial and attributed to modifications in ArnT (M114L/V117I/R372K), PhoQ (D150G), and the mgrB disruption by ISKpn25. Besides the presence of qnr and oqxAB genes, Kp196 also presented altered GyrA (S83I) and ParC (S80I). An in-block deletion in the repressor RamR, contributing to acrAB overexpression, and the presence of an enhanced-function AcrB variant (S966A), probably led to the Kp196 multidrug and tigecycline resistance. Insertions, in-block deletion, and missense mutations were involved with ompK35-36-37 inactivation, also accounting for the Kp196 multidrug resistance, including carbapenems. The Kp196 PDR profile, especially the carbapenem resistance, was due to the accumulation of different mechanisms, in which modifications in housekeeping genes accounted for a more stable resistome.",

    "abstract": "In Nature, chemotactic interactions are ubiquitous and play a critical role in driving the collective behaviour of living organisms. Reproducing these interactions in vitro is still a paramount challenge due to the complexity of mimicking and controlling cellular features, such as metabolic density, cytosolic macromolecular crowding and cellular migration, on a microorganism size scale. Here we generate enzymatically-active cell-size droplets able to move freely and, by following a chemical gradient, able to interact with the surrounding droplets in a collective manner. The enzyme within the droplets generates a pH gradient that protrudes to the outer edge of the droplets. We discovered that this external pH gradient controls droplets direction and speed, ultimately inducing migration. Further, we showed that these cellular-like features can facilitate the reconstitution of a simple and linear protometabolic pathway with improved overall activity. Our work suggests that simple and stable membraneless droplets can be applied to reproduce complex biological phenomena in vitro opening new perspectives as bioinspired materials and synthetic biology tools.",

    "abstract": "Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare heterogenic genetic disorder associated with perturbed biogenesis or function of motile cilia. Motile cilia dysfunction results in diminished mucociliary clearance (MCC) of pathogens in the respiratory tract and chronic airway inflammation and infections successively causing progressive lung damage. Current approaches to treat PCD are symptomatic, only, indicating an urgent need for curative therapeutic options. Here, we developed an in vitro model for PCD based on human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived airway epithelium in Air-Liquid-Interface cultures. Applying transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence staining, ciliary beat frequency and mucociliary transport measurements, we could demonstrate that ciliated respiratory epithelia cells derived from two PCD patient specific hiPSC lines carrying mutations in DNAH5 and NME5, respectively, recapitulate the respective diseased phenotype on a molecular, structural and functional level.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacological activation of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) pathway holds promise for increasing tumor immunogenicity and improving response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). However, the potency and clinical efficacy of 5-triphosphate RNA (3pRNA) agonists of RIG-I is hindered by multiple pharmacological barriers, including poor pharmacokinetics, nuclease degradation, and inefficient delivery to the cytosol where RIG-I is localized. Here, we address these challenges through the design and evaluation of ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for the delivery of 3p-modified stem-loop RNAs (SLRs). Packaging of SLRs into LNPs (SLR-LNPs) yielded surface charge-neutral nanoparticles with a size of [~]100 nm that activated RIG-I signaling in vitro and in vivo. SLR-LNPs were safely administered to mice via both intratumoral and intravenous routes, resulting in RIG-I activation in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and inhibition of tumor growth in mouse models of poorly immunogenic melanoma and breast cancer. Significantly, we found that systemic administration of SLR-LNPs reprogrammed the breast TME to enhance the infiltration of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells with antitumor function, resulting in enhanced response to PD-1 ICI in an orthotopic EO771 model of triple negative breast cancer. Therapeutic efficacy was further demonstrated in a metastatic B16.F10 melanoma model, with systemically administered SLR-LNPs significantly reducing lung metastatic burden compared to combined PD-1 + CTLA-4 ICI. Collectively, these studies have established SLR-LNPs as a translationally promising immunotherapeutic nanomedicine for potent and selective activation of RIG-I with potential to enhance response to ICIs and other immunotherapeutic modalities.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCanonical protein translation requires that ribosomes initiate translation at the correct start codon, maintain a single reading frame throughout elongation, and terminate at the first in-frame stop codon. However, ribosomal behavior can deviate at each of these steps, sometimes in a programmed manner. Certain mRNAs contain sequence and structural elements that cause ribosomes to begin translation at non-canonical start codons, shift reading frame, read through stop codons, or reinitiate on the same mRNA. These processes represent important translational control mechanisms that can allow an mRNA to encode multiple functional protein products or regulate protein expression. The prevalence of these events remains uncertain, due to the difficulty of systematic detection.\n\nResultsWe have developed a computational model to infer non-canonical translation events from ribosome profiling data.\n\nConclusionORFeus identifies known examples of alternative open reading frames and recoding events across different organisms and enables transcriptome-wide searches for novel events.",

    "abstract": "The computational principles underlying attention allocation in complex goal-directed tasks remain elusive. Goal-directed reading, i.e., reading a passage to answer a question in mind, is a common real-world task that strongly engages attention. Here, we investigate what computational models can explain attention distribution in this complex task. We show that the reading time on each word is predicted by the attention weights in transformer-based deep neural networks (DNNs) optimized to perform the same reading task. Eye-tracking further reveals that readers separately attend to basic text features and question-relevant information during first-pass reading and rereading, respectively. Similarly, text features and question relevance separately modulate attention weights in shallow and deep DNN layers. Furthermore, when readers scan a passage without a question in mind, their reading time is predicted by DNNs optimized for a word prediction task. Therefore, we offer a computational account of how task optimization modulates attention distribution during real-world reading.",
