    "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer that facilitates changes in many adaptive biological processes. Mutations in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH) lead to fumarate accumulation and cause hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC). HLRCC is a rare, inherited disease characterized by the development of non-cancerous smooth muscle tumors of the uterus and skin, and an increased risk of a highly metastatic and aggressive form of kidney cancer. Fumarate has been shown to inhibit 2-oxyglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2OGDDs) involved in the hydroxylation of HIF1, as well as in DNA and histone demethylation. However, the link between fumarate accumulation and changes in RNA post-transcriptional modifications has not been defined. Here, we determine the consequences of fumarate accumulation on the activity of different members of the 2OGDD family targeting RNA modifications. By evaluating multiple RNA modifications in patient-derived HLRCC cell lines, we show that mutation of FH selectively alters the activity of demethylases acting upon N6-methyladenosine (m6A), while the demethylase acting upon N1-methyladenosine (m1A) and 5-formylcytosine (f5C) in mitochondrial RNA are unaffected. The observation that metabolites modulate specific subsets of RNA-modifying enzymes offers new insights into the intersection between metabolism and the epitranscriptome.",

    "abstract": "Protozoan parasites use cAMP signaling to precisely regulate the place and time of developmental differentiation, yet it is unclear how this signaling is initiated. Encystation of the intestinal parasite Giardia lamblia can be activated by multiple stimuli, which we hypothesize result in a common physiological change. We demonstrate that bile alters plasma membrane fluidity by reducing cholesterol-rich lipid microdomains, while alkaline pH enhances bile function. Through depletion of the cAMP producing enzyme Adenylate Cyclase 2 (AC2) and the use of a newly developed Giardia-specific cAMP sensor, we show that AC2 is necessary for encystation stimuli-induced cAMP upregulation and activation of downstream signaling. Conversely, over expression of AC2 or exogenous cAMP were sufficient to initiate encystation. Our findings indicate that encystation stimuli induce membrane reorganization, trigger AC2- dependent cAMP upregulation, and initiate encystation-specific gene expression, thereby advancing our understanding of a critical stage in the life cycle of a globally important parasite.",

    "abstract": "Bees are in global decline and specialized species might be the most vulnerable to extinctions. Bee conservation can be studied using interaction networks, whose relative importance of nodes might correlate with morphological traits. Specifically, body size could affect flying range and thus influence the set of plant-bee interactions. Although several studies have reported botanical sources of resins in stingless bees, resin foraging networks were rarely assembled. Here we aim to describe the global resin-foraging meta-network of stingless bees, identify the most specialized species, and test how body size influences modularity and specialization. We found a modular and nested structure, in which some modules exhibit significant differences in body size and specialization. Melipona beecheii is the most specialized stingless bee in collecting resins. Body size is positively correlated with specialization, in which larger bees are more specialized to collect resins from a subset of plants, possibly because larger bees with broader flying ranges avoid competition by collecting less disputed resources. Our results demonstrate how resin collection can be analyzed in a meta-network framework to test ecological hypotheses and identify specialized species as candidate priorities for the conservation of stingless bees.",

    "abstract": "Polyomaviruses are small, non-enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses of humans and other mammals, birds, and fish. Infections are usually asymptomatic and result in latency, however, some polyomaviruses can induce severe diseases, including cancer, in immunocompromised individuals. Established cellular receptors for polyomavirus infection are sialylated glycolipids (such as gangliosides), membrane proteins, and glycosaminoglycans. Polyomaviruses are usually highly host specific but the exact principles that govern host tropism remain unknown in many cases. Here, glycan array screening shows that the major capsid protein VP1 of sheep polyomavirus (ShPyV) binds to the Forssman glycolipid, an antigen of many vertebrates and a potential tumor marker in humans. Following closer investigation, we can report for the first time that a neutral, non-sialylated glycolipid acts as a polyomavirus receptor. Concurrently, we present the first report of a viral protein that specifically engages the Forssman antigen. We demonstrate that ShPyV VP1 binds to Forssman-positive erythrocytes but not those of human A, B and O blood groups, which is a clear distinction from features thus far described for Forssman lectins. X-ray crystallography and structural analysis of the VP1-Forssman glycan complex define the terminal Forssman disaccharide as the determinant of this protein-receptor interaction. These results strongly suggest that the sheep polyomavirus can use Forssman antigen for infectious cell entry. Furthermore, the ability of ShPyV VP1 to distinguish Forssman-positive from -negative cells may prove useful for monitoring the Forssman- status of normal, preneoplastic and neoplastic cells and tissues and establishing the antigen level as a biomarker.\n\nAuthor summaryElucidation of host cell receptor specificities of viral infection is crucial to understand the pathobiology of associated diseases and develop treatments. However, for many polyomaviruses the receptor engagement as the initial event in infection is poorly understood. In only a few cases polyomavirus tropism has been pinned down to a single type of glycan receptor. While many polyomaviruses utilize sialyl glycans to attach to host cells, the role of non-sialylated glycans as receptors is so far underestimated. Here, we show for the first time that a glycan of neutral charge, in this case the carbohydrate portion of the Forssman antigen, acts as a ligand for a polyomavirus capsid protein and may thus contribute to host tropism and infective cell entry. These results represent a significant addition to knowledge on polyomavirus-glycan interactions and complement general principles of carbohydrate engagement by viruses. Furthermore, as a specific binding protein of Forssman antigen, VP1 may help to determine levels of this antigen in healthy and malignant tissues in humans.",

EGF binding promotes EGFR dimerization and autophosphorylation through interactions that are well understood structurally. However, it is not clear how these dimers relate to higher-order EGFR oligomers detected at the cell surface. We used single-particle tracking (SPT) and Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging to examine how each domain within EGFR contributes to receptor dimerization and the rate of its diffusion in the cell membrane. We show that the EGFR extracellular region is sufficient to drive receptor dimerization, but that the EGF-induced EGFR slow-down seen by SPT requires formation of higher order oligomers, mediated in part by the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain - but only when in its active conformation. Our data thus provide important insight into higher-order EGFR interactions required for EGF signaling.",

Here we report a new method, PERT, which jointly infers replication and somatic copy number states of S-phase cells. This method enabled us to analyze the replication dynamics of >10,000 S-phase single-cell genomes across various triple negative breast cancers and cell lines with subclonal copy number heterogeneity.

    "abstract": "Type 2 NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh-2) is an oxidative phosphorylation enzyme discussed as a promising drug target in different pathogens, including Plasmodium falciparum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). To kill Mtb, Ndh-2 needs to be inactivated together with the alternative enzyme type 1 NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh-1), but the mechanism of this synthetic lethality remained unknown. Here, we provide insights into the biology of NADH dehydrogenases and a mechanistic explanation for Ndh-1 and Ndh-2 synthetic lethality in Mtb. NADH dehydrogenases have two main functions: maintaining an appropriate NADH/NAD+ ratio by converting NADH into NAD+ and providing electrons to the respiratory chain. Heterologous expression of a water forming NADH oxidase (Nox), which catalyzes the oxidation of NADH, allows to distinguish between these two functions and show that Nox rescues Mtb from Ndh-1/Ndh-2 synthetic lethality, indicating that NADH oxidation is the essential function of NADH dehydrogenases for Mtb viability. Quantification of intracellular levels of NADH, NAD, ATP, and oxygen consumption revealed that preventing NADH oxidation by Ndh-2 depletes NAD(H) and inhibits respiration. Finally, we show that Ndh-1/ Ndh-2 synthetic lethality can be achieved through chemical inhibition.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn 2022, it is estimated that 10.6 million people fell ill, and 1.6 million people died from Tuberculosis (TB). Available treatment is lengthy and requires a multi-drug regimen, which calls for new strategies to cure Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections more efficiently. We have previously shown that simultaneous inactivation of type 1 (Ndh-1) and type 2 (Ndh-2) NADH dehydrogenase kills Mtb. NADH dehydrogenases play two main physiological roles: NADH oxidation and electron entry to the respiratory chain. Here, we show that this bactericidal effect is a consequence of impaired NADH oxidation. Importantly, we demonstrate that Ndh-1/Ndh-2 synthetic lethality can be achieved through simultaneous chemical inhibition, which could be exploited by TB drug development programs.",

    "abstract": "Engineered plasmids have been workhorses of recombinant DNA technology for nearly half a century. Plasmids are used to clone DNA sequences encoding new genetic parts and to reprogram cells by combining these parts in new ways. Historically, many genetic parts on plasmids were copied and reused without routinely checking their DNA sequences. With the widespread use of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies, we now know that plasmids often contain variants of common genetic parts that differ slightly from their canonical sequences. Because the exact provenance of a genetic part on a particular plasmid is usually unknown, it is difficult to determine whether these differences arose due to mutations during plasmid construction and propagation or due to intentional editing by researchers. In either case, it is important to understand how the sequence changes alter the properties of the genetic part. We analyzed the sequences of over 50,000 engineered plasmids using depositor metadata and a metric inspired by the natural language processing field. We detected 217 uncatalogued genetic part variants that were especially widespread or were likely the result of convergent evolution or engineering. Several of these uncatalogued variants are known mutants of plasmid origins of replication or antibiotic resistance genes that are missing from current annotation databases. However, most are uncharacterized, and 3/5 of the plasmids we analyzed contained at least one of the uncatalogued variants. Our results include a list of genetic parts to prioritize for refining engineered plasmid annotation pipelines, highlight widespread variants of parts that warrant further investigation to see whether they have altered characteristics, and suggest cases where unintentional evolution of plasmid parts may be affecting the reliability and reproducibility of science.\n\nAuthor SummaryPlasmids are used in molecular biology and biotechnology for a wide variety of tasks such as cloning DNA, expressing recombinant proteins, and creating vaccines. One challenge in working with plasmids is that there has been a long, and often lost history of pieces of plasmids being copied and remixed by researchers to create new plasmids. Current databases used for annotating key genetic parts in plasmids are incomplete, especially with respect to cataloguing closely related versions of parts that can have very different characteristics. Some genetic part variants have arisen due to purposeful editing while others are the result of unplanned mutations and evolution. When a researcher finds differences between a database sequence and a genetic part in their newly constructed plasmid, it is often unclear how and when it arose and whether it will affect their experiments. We identified 217 genetic part variants that are either widespread or have likely arisen independently more than once on plasmids due to convergent evolution or engineering. We propose that these variants should be prioritized for inclusion in curated databases of engineered DNA sequences and for functional characterization to improve the reliability and reproducibility of science.",

    "abstract": "Steroid hormones remodel neural networks to induce developmental or seasonal changes in animal behavior, but little is known about hormonal modulation of sensorimotor integration. Here, we investigate hormonal effects on a predictive motor signal, termed corollary discharge, that modulates sensory processing in weakly electric mormyrid fish. In the electrosensory pathway mediating communication behavior, inhibition activated by a corollary discharge precisely blocks sensory responses to self-generated electric pulses, allowing the downstream circuit to selectively analyze communication signals from nearby fish. These electric pulses are elongated by increasing testosterone levels in males during the breeding season. Using systematic testosterone treatment, we induced electric-pulse elongation in fish and found that the timing of electroreceptor spiking responses to self-generated pulses (reafference) was delayed as electric pulse duration increased. Recording evoked potentials from a midbrain electrosensory nucleus revealed that the timing of corollary discharge inhibition was delayed and elongated by testosterone. Further, this shift in corollary discharge timing was precisely matched to the shift in timing of the reafferent spikes. We then asked whether the shift in inhibition timing was caused by direct action of testosterone on the corollary discharge circuit or plasticity of the circuit through altered sensory feedback. We surgically silenced the electric organs of fish and found similar hormonal modulation of corollary discharge timing between intact and silent fish, suggesting that sensory feedback was not required for this shift. These results demonstrate that testosterone directly and independently modulates peripheral motor output and a predictive motor signal in a coordinated manner.\n\nSignificanceSelf-other discrimination is essential for animals. Internal predictive motor signals, or corollary discharge, provide motor information to sensory areas so that animals can perceive self- and other-generated stimuli differently. As behavior and associated sensory feedback change with development, corollary discharge must adjust accordingly. Using weakly electric mormyrid fish, we show that the steroid hormone testosterone alters electric signaling behavior and the resulting sensory feedback, as well as the timing of corollary discharge, to precisely match the altered sensory feedback. We also found that the altered sensory feedback itself is not necessary to drive this corollary discharge modulation. Our findings demonstrate that testosterone directly and independently regulates peripheral motor output and corollary discharge in a coordinated manner.",

We define high-dimensional oscillatory portraits to capture the interdependence between basic oscillatory elements, quantifying oscillations occurring in single-trials at specific frequencies, locations and time epochs. We find that the general structure of the element-interdependence networks (effective connectivity) remains stable across task conditions, reflecting an intrinsic coordination architecture and responds to changes in task constraints by subtle but consistently distinct topological reorganizations. Trial categories are reliably and significantly better separated using oscillatory portraits, than from the information contained in individual oscillatory elements, suggesting an inter-element coordination-based encoding. Furthermore, single-trial oscillatory portrait fluctuations are predictive of fine trial-to-trial variations in movement kinematics.

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the single most common monogenetic cause of autism spectrum disorders in humans. FXS is caused by loss of expression of the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an mRNA-binding protein encoded on the X chromosome involved in suppressing protein translation. Sensory processing deficits have been a major focus of studies of FXS in both humans and rodent models of FXS, but olfactory deficits remain poorly understood. Here we conducted experiments in wild-type and Fmr1 KO (Fmr1-/y) mice (males) that lack expression of the gene encoding FMRP to assess olfactory circuit and behavioral abnormalities. In patch-clamp recordings conducted in slices of the olfactory bulb, output mitral cells (MCs) in Fmr1 KO mice displayed greatly enhanced excitation, as evidenced by a much higher rate of occurrence of spontaneous network-level events known as long-lasting depolarizations (LLDs). The higher probability of LLDs did not appear to reflect changes in inhibitory connections onto MCs but rather enhanced spontaneous excitation of external tufted cells (eTCs) that provide feedforward excitation onto MCs within glomeruli. In addition, in a go/no-go operant discrimination paradigm, we found that Fmr1 KO mice displayed impaired discrimination of odors in difficult tasks that involved odor mixtures but not altered discrimination of monomolecular odors. We suggest that the higher excitability of MCs in Fmr1 KO mice may impair fine odor discrimination by broadening odor tuning curves of MCs and/or altering synchronized oscillations through changes in transient inhibition.\n\nSignificance StatementFragile X syndrome (FXS) in humans is associated with a range of debilitating deficits including aberrant sensory processing. One sensory system that has received comparatively little attention in studies in animal models of FXS is olfaction. Here, we report the first comprehensive physiological analysis of circuit defects in the olfactory bulb in the commonly-used Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse model of FXS. Our studies indicate that Fmr1 KO alters the local excitation/inhibition balance in the bulb - similar to what Fmr1 KO does in other brain circuits - but through a novel mechanism that involves enhanced feedforward excitatory drive. Furthermore, Fmr1 KO mice display behavioral impairments in fine odor discrimination, an effect that may be explained by enhanced neural excitability.",

    "abstract": "Cetacea and other diving mammals have undergone numerous adaptations to their aquatic environment, among them high levels of the oxygen-carrying intracellular hemoprotein myoglobin in skeletal muscles, especially those responsible for swimming. Hypotheses regarding the mechanisms leading to these high myoglobin levels often invoke exercise, hypoxia, and other physiological pathways that impact gene regulation, and increase myoglobin gene expression. Here we explore an alternative hypothesis: that Cetacean myoglobin genes have evolved high levels of transcription driven by the intrinsic developmental mechanisms that drive muscle cell differentiation. We have used luciferase assays in differentiated C2C12 cells to test this hypothesis. Contrary to our hypothesis, we find that the myoglobin gene from the minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata, has a low level of expression, less than 10% that of humans. This low expression level is broadly shared among Cetaceans, and Artiodactylans. Previous work on regulation of the human gene has identified a core muscle-specific enhancer comprised of two regions, the \"AT element\" and a C-rich sequence 5 of the AT element termed the \"CCAC-box\". Comparative analysis of the minke whale gene supports the importance of the AT element, but the minke whale CCAC-box ortholog has little effect. Instead, critical positive input has been identified in a G-rich region 3 of the AT element. Also, a conserved E-box in exon 1 positively affects expression, despite having been assigned a repressive role in the human gene. Last, a novel region 5 of the core enhancer has been identified, which we hypothesize may function as a boundary element. These results illustrate regulatory flexibility during evolution. They also support the hypothesis that the induction of transcription by physiological signaling pathways, and evolved protein stability are important in leading to the high myoglobin protein levels found in Cetaceans.",

    "abstract": "The heritability explained by local ancestry markers in an admixed population [Formula] provides crucial insight into the genetic architecture of a complex disease or trait. Estimation of [Formula] can be susceptible to biases due to population structure in ancestral populations. Here, we present a novel approach, Heritability estimation from Admixture Mapping Summary STAtistics (HAMSTA), which uses summary statistics from admixture mapping to infer heritability explained by local ancestry while adjusting for biases due to ancestral stratification. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that HAMSTA [Formula] estimates are approximately unbiased and are robust to ancestral stratification compared to existing approaches. In the presence of ancestral stratification, we show a HAMSTA-derived sampling scheme provides a calibrated family-wise error rate (FWER) of [~]5% for admixture mapping, unlike existing FWER estimation approaches. We apply HAMSTA to 20 quantitative phenotypes of up to 15,988 self-reported African American individuals in the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study. We observe [Formula] in the 20 phenotypes range from 0.0025 to 0.033 (mean [Formula]), which translates to [Formula] ranging from 0.062 to 0.85 (mean [Formula]). Across these phenotypes we find little evidence of inflation due to ancestral population stratification in current admixture mapping studies (mean inflation factor of 0.99 +/-0.001). Overall, HAMSTA provides a fast and powerful approach to estimate genome-wide heritability and evaluate biases in test statistics of admixture mapping studies.",

    "abstract": "Neanderthal genomes have been recovered from sites across Eurasia, painting an increasingly complex picture of their populations structure, mostly indicating that late European Neanderthals belonged to a single metapopulation with no significant evidence of deep population structure. Here we report the discovery of a late Neanderthal individual, nicknamed \"Thorin\", from Grotte Mandrin in Mediterranean France, and his genome. These dentognathic fossils, including a rare example of distomolars, are associated with a rich archeological record of their final technological traditions in this region [~]50-42 thousand years ago. Thorins genome reveals a deep divergence with other late Neanderthals. Thorin belonged to a population with small group size that showed no genetic introgression with other known late European Neanderthals, revealing genetic isolation of his lineage despite them living in neighboring regions. These results have important implications for resolving competing hypotheses about causes of the Neanderthals disappearance.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA new French Neanderthal fossil and its genome reveal complex population dynamics during the past 100,000 years.",
