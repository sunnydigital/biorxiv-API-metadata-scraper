    "abstract": "Dietary methionine restriction is associated with a reduction in tumor growth in preclinical studies and an increase in lifespan in animal models. The mechanism by which methionine restriction inhibits tumor growth while sparing normal cells is incompletely understood. We do know that normal cells can utilize methionine or homocysteine interchangeably (methionine independence) while most cancer cells are strictly dependent on methionine availability. Here, we compared a typical methionine dependent and a rare methionine independent melanoma cell line. We show that replacing methionine, a methyl donor, with its precursor homocysteine generally induced hypomethylation in gene promoters. This decrease was similar in methionine dependent and methionine independent cells. There was only a low level of pathway enrichment, suggesting that the hypomethylation is generalized rather than gene specific. Whole proteome and transcriptome were also analyzed. This analysis revealed that contrarily to the effect on methylation, the replacement of methionine with homocysteine had a much greater effect on the transcriptome and proteome of methionine dependent cells than methionine independent cells. Interestingly, methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A), responsible for the synthesis of s-adenosylmethionine from methionine, was equally strongly upregulated in both cell lines. This suggests that the absence of methionine is equally detected but triggers different outcomes in methionine dependent versus independent cells. Our analysis reveals the importance of cell cycle control, DNA damage repair, translation, nutrient sensing, oxidative stress and immune functions in the cellular response to methionine stress in melanoma.",

    "abstract": "One challenge for liver-directed gene therapy is sufficient vector delivery to the target tissue while minimizing loss of the applied vector dose to other tissues. Infusion via peripheral veins is the least invasive approach; however, it results in systemic diffusion and substantial vector dilution. Here, we describe a safe and minimally invasive method to deliver adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to the liver of small weaned pigs by ultrasound-guided percutaneous trans-hepatic portal vein injection. 4-week-old piglets were infused with [~]2.5x1014 vector genomes comprising a dual-rAAV2/9 vector system with a split adenine base editor for in vivo inactivation of PCSK9 to reduce LDL-cholesterol levels. Animals had no signs of discomfort and tolerated the procedure well. However, despite 45% editing of the target site with the applied adenine base editor system in cultivated porcine cells, we only found low amounts of AAV vector genomes and neither detectable transgene-expression nor successful editing in the treated pig livers. We hypothesize that rapid proliferation of pig hepatocytes caused AAV vector dilution, leading to a loss of the vectors from the nucleus, and hence insufficient base editor protein expression for achieving detectable editing rates. Nonetheless, ultrasound-guided percutaneous transhepatic injection to the portal vein is well-tolerated in piglets and has potential for human (neonate) application.",

These two triterpenes known to possess potent anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, and anti-fungal properties along with various other biological activities. In this study, De-novo assembly and comparative transcriptome analysis of leaf and stem tissues of E. tirucalli and E. grantii were carried out to identify thirteen triterpene synthases from 1,40,227 in correlation with the metabolic profiling. Comparative transcriptome analysis indicated that EutTTS4 and EutTTS5 genes which encodes for euphol/tirucallol and tirucallol synthase were highly expressed in leaf and stem tissue. The genes which encodes -amyrin synthase (EutTTS1) and lupeol synthase (EutTTS2) were characterized by overexpressing them in YPH499 yeast strain. We have developed using hem1 and erg7 knock yeast strain of lanosterol deficient yeast (TMBL17) and used for over expression of friedelin synthase (EutTTS3), and two novel triterpenes synthases such as euphol/tirucallol synthase (EutTTS4) and tirucallol synthase (EutTTS5).

The focus of this study was to observe and elaborate the effect of Ziqi Dihuang (ZQDH) decoction on inflammatory and thrombosis-related parameters in septic rats.\n\nExperimental procedureA rat model of sepsis was established by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). 24 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into Sham group, CLP group, ZQDH-1ow group (0.735g/kg) and ZQDH-high group (1.47g/kg). Rats in ZQDH groups were given ZQDH decoction by gavage for 7 days before CLP, while rats in Sham and CLP groups were given the same amount of normal saline. Leukocytes and percentage of neutrophils (N %) in blood, and inflammatory cell infiltration of liver, kidney and lung were used to assess systemic inflammatory response. Coagulation and fibrinolytic indexes included platelet count, coagulation function, fibrin deposition, and levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in serum, liver, kidney and lung.\n\nResultsZQDH decoctioninhibited N% growth in blood and inflammatory cell infiltration in the lung of CLP rats.

We searched metagenomes and abundantly found the genes encoding GO DNA repair at the Lost City Hydrothermal Field (LCHF). We recombinantly expressed the final enzyme in the system to show MutY homologs function to suppress mutations. Microbes at the LCHF thrive without sunlight, fueled by the products of geochemical transformations of seafloor rocks, under conditions believed to resemble a young Earth. High levels of the reductant H2 and low levels of O2 in this environment raise the question, why are resident microbes equipped to repair damage caused by oxidative stress? MutY genes could be assigned to metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs), and thereby associate GO DNA repair with metabolic pathways that generate reactive oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur species. Our results indicate that cell-based life was under evolutionary pressure to cope with oxidized guanine well before O2 levels rose following the great oxidation event.",

    "abstract": "Galapagos giant tortoises are endemic to the Galapagos Archipelago, where they are found in isolated populations. While these populations are widely considered distinguishable in morphology, behavior, and genetics, the recent divergence of these taxa has made their status as species controversial. Here, we apply modern methods of species delimitation to whole genome resequencing data from 38 tortoises across all 13 extant taxa to assess support for delimiting these taxa as species. We find strong evidence to reject the hypothesis that all Galapagos giant tortoises belong to a single species. Instead, a conservative interpretation of model-based and divergence-based results indicates that these taxa form a species complex consisting of a minimum of 5 species, with some analyses supporting as many as 13 species. There is mixed support for the species status of taxa living on the same island, with some methods delimiting them as separate species and others suggesting there is a single species per island. These results make clear that Galapagos giant tortoise taxa represent different stages in the process of speciation, with some taxa further along in that evolutionary process than others. A better understanding of the more complex parts of that process is urgently needed, given the threatened status of Galapagos giant tortoises.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosoma cruzi, a heme auxotrophic parasite, can control intracellular heme content by modulating TcHRG expression when a free heme source is added to axenic culture. Herein, we explore the role of TcHRG protein in regulating the uptake of heme derived from hemoglobin in epimastigotes. It was found that the parasites endogenous TcHRG (protein and mRNA) responds similarly to bound (hemoglobin) and free (hemin) heme. Additionally, the overexpression of TcHRG leads to an increase in intracellular heme content. The localization of TcHRG is also not affected in parasites supplemented with hemoglobin as the sole heme source. Endocytic null epimastigotes do not show a significant difference in growth profile, intracellular heme content and TcHRG protein accumulation compared to WT when feeding with hemoglobin or hemin as a source of heme. These results suggest that the uptake of hemoglobin-derived heme likely occurs through extracellular proteolysis of hemoglobin via the flagellar pocket, and this process is governed by TcHRG. In sum, T. cruzi epimastigotes controls heme homeostasis by modulating TcHRG expression independently of the source of available heme.",

Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and HDL-Trig were also measured. Students t test was used for statistical analysis\n\nResultsInterestingly, plaque was highest in SLE subset with anti-Ro60 (23/114). Plaque and anti-oxLDL were statistically significantly elevated in the anti-Ro60 SLE subset (1.3 +/-1.66, p<0.01; 0.26 +/-0.16, p<0.002 respectively) compared to controls (0.54 +/-1.26; 0.165 +/-0.13 respectively), but not anti-LPL/anti-LDL. Plaque was significantly elevated (0.9 +/-1.71; p< 0.05) in the SLE subset without anti-ENA (63/114) compared to controls.

Only anti-oxLDL was significantly elevated (0.29 +/-0.27; p<0.005) in SLE subset with anti-RNP (14/114) compared to controls, while none were elevated in anti-SmRNP subset (6/114). We did not find significant differences in lipids between various SLE subsets.\n\nConclusionPlaque segregates in anti-Ro and ENA negative groups either with or without anti-oxLDL.

The labeled glycans were employed in 2D STD-1H and 13C-HSQC NMR experiments to pinpoint which monosaccharides of the extended LacNAc chain engage with evolutionarily distinct HAs. The NMR data in combination with computational and mutagenesis studies demonstrate that mutations distal to the receptor binding domain of recent HAs have created an extended binding site that can directly interact with the extended LacNAc chain.

    "abstract": "Ribosomes are information-processing macromolecular machines that integrate complex sequence patterns in messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts to synthesize proteins. Studies of the sequence features that distinguish mRNAs from long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may yield insight into the information that directs and regulates translation. Computational methods for calculating protein-coding potential are important for distinguishing mRNAs from lncRNAs during genome annotation, but most machine learning methods for this task rely on previously known rules to define features. Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, particularly ones using transformer networks, have proven capable of learning complex grammatical relationships between words to perform natural language translation. Seeking to leverage these advancements in the biological domain, we present a seq2seq formulation for predicting protein-coding potential with deep neural networks and demonstrate that simultaneously learning translation from RNA to protein improves classification performance relative to a classification-only training objective. Inspired by classical signal processing methods for gene discovery and Fourier-based image-processing neural networks, we introduce LocalFilterNet (LFNet). LFNet is a network architecture with an inductive bias for modeling the three-nucleotide periodicity apparent in coding sequences. We incorporate LFNet within an encoder-decoder framework to test whether the translation task improves the classification of transcripts and the interpretation of their sequence features. We use the resulting model to compute nucleotide-resolution importance scores, revealing sequence patterns that could assist the cellular machinery in distinguishing mRNAs and lncRNAs. Finally, we develop a novel approach for estimating mutation effects from Integrated Gradients, a backpropagation-based feature attribution, and characterize the difficulty of efficient approximations in this setting.",

First, we establish the map that correlates RNA sequence and MspA ion current. We find that during sequencing the RT can sense the strength of RNA secondary structures 11-12 nt downstream of its front boundary, modifying its stepping dynamics accordingly.

Starting from patient cells, we established prostate cancer tumoroids (PCTs) and demonstrated they require TGF-{beta} signalling pathway activity to preserve phenotypical and structural similarities with the tissue of origin. By modulating TGF-{beta} signalling pathway in PCTs, we unveiled its role in ECM accumulation and remodelling in prostate cancer. We also found that TGF-{beta}-induced ECM remodelling is responsible for the initiation of prostate cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the acquisition of a migratory, invasive phenotype.

Here, we overcome this limitation by developing a photoreceptor-based hydrogel with reversibly adjustable stiffness from 800 Pa to the sol state. The hydrogel is based on star-shaped polyethylene glycol, functionalized with the red/far-red light photoreceptor phytochrome B (PhyB), or phytochrome-interacting factor 6 (PIF6). Upon illumination with red light, PhyB heterodimerizes with PIF6, thus crosslinking the polymers and resulting in gelation. However, upon illumination with far-red light, the proteins dissociate and trigger a complete gel-to-sol transition. We comprehensively characterize the hydrogels light-responsive mechanical properties and apply it as reversible extracellular matrix for the spatiotemporally controlled deposition of mammalian cells within a microfluidic chip. We anticipate that this technology will open new avenues for the site- and time-specific positioning of cells and will contribute to overcome spatial restrictions.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we demonstrate the utility of whole-slide CyCIF (tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence) imaging for characterizing immune cell infiltrates in immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced dermatologic adverse events (dAEs). We analyzed six cases of ICI-induced dAEs, including lichenoid, bullous pemphigoid, psoriasis, and eczematous eruptions, comparing immune profiling results obtained using both standard immunohistochemistry (IHC) and CyCIF. Our findings indicate that CyCIF provides more detailed and precise single-cell characterization of immune cell infiltrates than IHC, which relies on semi-quantitative scoring by pathologists. This pilot study highlights the potential of CyCIF to advance our understanding of the immune environment in dAEs by revealing tissue-level spatial patterns of immune cell infiltrates, allowing for more precise phenotypic distinctions and deeper exploration of disease mechanisms. By demonstrating that CyCIF can be performed on friable tissues, such as bullous pemphigoid, we provide a foundation for future studies to examine the drivers of specific dAEs using larger cohorts of phenotyped toxicity and suggest a broader role for highly multiplexed tissue imaging in phenotyping the immune mediated disease that they resemble.",

    "abstract": "Introduction/ObjectiveDysregulated inflammation-resolution programs are associated with atherosclerosis progression. Inflammation-resolution is in part mediated by Resolvins, including Resolvin D2 (RvD2). RvD2, which activates a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) called GPR18, limits plaque progression. Cellular targets of RvD2 are not known.\n\nApproach and ResultsHere we developed humanized GPR18 floxed (\"fl/fl\") and a myeloid (Lysozyme M Cre) GPR18 knockout (mKO) mouse. We functionally validated this model by assessing efferocytosis in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) and found that RvD2 enhanced efferocytosis in the fl/fl, but not in the mKO BMDMs. We employed two different models to evaluate the role of GPR18 in atherosclerosis. We first used the PCSK9-gain of function approach and found increased necrosis in the plaques of the mKO mice compared with fl/fl mice. Next, we performed a bone marrow transfer of fl/fl or mKO bone marrow into Ldlr-/- recipients. For these experiments, we treated each genotype with either Veh or RvD2 (25 ng/mouse, 3 times/week for 3 weeks). Myeloid loss of GPR18 resulted in significantly more necrosis and cleaved caspase-3+ cells compared with fl/fl transplanted mice. RvD2 treatment decreased plaques necrosis and cleaved caspase-3+ cells in fl/fl, but not in the mKO transplanted mice.\n\nConclusionsThese results are the first to suggest a causative role for endogenous RvD2 signaling on myeloid cells in limiting plaque necrosis. Moreover, these results provide a mechanistic basis for RvD2 as a therapy limiting plaque necrosis.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial capsules provide protection against environmental challenges and host immunity. Historically, Escherichia coli K serotyping scheme, which relies on the hypervariable capsules, has identified around 80 K forms that fall into four distinct groups. Based on recent work by us and others, we predicted that E. coli capsular diversity is grossly underestimated. We exploited Group 3 capsule gene clusters, the best genetically defined capsule group in E. coli, to analyse publicly available E. coli sequences for overlooked capsular diversity within the species. We report the discovery of seven novel Group 3 clusters that fall into two distinct subgroups (3A and 3B). The majority of the 3B capsule clusters were found on plasmids, contrary to the defining feature of Group 3 capsule genes localising at the serA locus on the E. coli chromosome. Other new Group 3 capsule clusters were derived from ancestral sequences through recombination events between shared genes found within the serotype variable central region 2. Intriguingly, flanking regions 1 and 3, known to be conserved areas among capsule clusters, showed considerable intra-subgroup variation in clusters from the 3B subgroup, containing genes of shared ancestry with other Enterobacteriaceae species. Variation of Group 3 kps clusters within dominant E. coli lineages, including multi-drug-resistant pathogenic lineages, further supports that E. coli capsules are undergoing rigorous change. Given the pivotal role of capsular polysaccharides in phage predation, our findings raise attention to the need of monitoring kps evolutionary dynamics in pathogenic E. coli in supporting phage therapy.\n\nIMPORTANCECapsular polysaccharides protect pathogenic bacteria against environmental challenges, host immunity, and phage predations. The historical Escherichia coli K typing scheme, which relies on the hypervariable capsular polysaccharide, has identified around 80 different K forms that fall into four distinct groups. Taking advantage of the supposedly compact and genetically well-defined Group 3 gene clusters, we analysed published E. coli sequences to identify seven new gene clusters and revealed an unexpected capsular diversity. Genetic analysis revealed that Group 3 gene clusters shared closely related serotype-specific region 2 and were diversified through recombination events and plasmid transfer between multiple Enterobacteriaceae species. Overall, capsular polysaccharides in E. coli are undergoing rigorous change. Given the pivotal role capsules play in phage interactions, this work highlighted the need to monitor the evolutionary dynamics of capsules in pathogenic E. coli for effective phage therapy.",

    "abstract": "Vesicular trafficking, including secretion and endocytosis, plays fundamental roles in the unique biology of P. falciparum blood-stage parasites. Endocytosis of host cell cytosol (HCC) provides nutrients and room for parasite growth and is critical for the action of antimalarial drugs and parasite drug resistance. Previous work showed that PfVPS45 functions in endosomal transport of HCC to the parasites food vacuole, raising the possibility that malaria parasites possess a canonical endolysosomal system. However, the seeming absence of VPS45-typical functional interactors such as rabenosyn 5 (Rbsn5) and the re-purposing of Rab5 isoforms and other endolysosomal proteins for secretion in apicomplexans question this idea. Here we identified the likely parasite Rbsn5 and show that it functions with VPS45 in the endosomal transport of HCC. We also show that PfRab5b but not PfRab5a is involved in the same process. Inactivation of PfRbsn5 resulted in PI3P and PfRab5b decorated HCC-filled vesicles, typical for endosomal compartments. Overall this indicates that despite the low sequence conservation of PfRbsn5 and the unusual N-terminal modification of PfRab5b, principles of endosomal transport in malaria parasite are similar to that of model organisms. Using a conditional double protein inactivation system, we further provide evidence that the PfKelch13 compartment, an unusual apicomplexa-specific endocytosis structure at the parasite plasma membrane, is connected upstream of the Rbsn5/VPS45/Rab5b-dependent endosomal route. Altogether, this work indicates that HCC-uptake consists of a highly parasite-specific part that feeds endocytosed material into a more canonical endosomal system, leading to the delivery of HCC to the food vacuole.",

    "abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the leading global cause of virus-induced encephalitis. Its pathogenesis is driven by a combination of neuronal cell death and neuroinflammation. We hypothesized that pharmacological upregulation of autophagy could exert a neuroprotective antiviral effect, and tested a panel of forty-two FDA-approved drugs that were shown to induce autophagy. Four drugs were tested in the JE mouse model based on in vitro protective effects on neuronal cell death, inhibition of viral replication, and anti-inflammatory effects in microglial cells. The antipsychotic phenothiazines Methotrimeprazine (MTP) and Trifluoperazine (TFP) showed a significant survival benefit with reduced virus titers in the brain, prevention of blood-brain barrier (BBB) breach, and inhibition of neuroinflammation. Both drugs were potent mTOR-independent autophagy flux inducers. Mechanistically MTP inhibited SERCA channel functioning, thereby resulting in rise in cytosolic calcium levels, and induction of a unique adaptive ER stress response. In virus infected drug treated cells, there was a strong transcriptional downregulation of type I interferon and interferon-stimulated genes and upregulation of cholesterol metabolic pathway genes. The drugs exerted an autophagy-dependent antiviral effect at the level of JEV protein translation/replication complex formation in diverse cell types. Inhibition of inflammatory cytokine/chemokine release from mouse microglial cells was partly autophagy-dependent. Our study suggests that MTP exerts a combined antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect in JEV infection, and has therapeutic potential to be repurposed for JE treatment.",

    "abstract": "Large heteromeric multiprotein complexes play pivotal roles at every step of gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Among them, the 20-subunit basal transcription factor TFIID nucleates RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex at gene promoters. Here, by combining systematic RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiments, single-molecule imaging, proteomics and structure-function analyses, we show that TFIID biogenesis occurs co-translationally. We discovered that all protein heterodimerization steps happen during protein synthesis. We identify TAF1 - the largest protein in the complex - as a critical factor for TFIID assembly. TAF1 acts as a flexible scaffold that drives the co-translational recruitment of TFIID submodules preassembled in the cytoplasm. Altogether, our data suggest a multistep hierarchical model for TFIID biogenesis that culminates with the co-translational assembly of the complex onto the nascent TAF1 polypeptide. We envision that this assembly strategy could be shared with other large heteromeric protein complexes.",

    "abstract": "One of the most common drivers in human cancer is KRAS4B. In recent years, the promising KRAS targeted drug development has attracted significant new research interest and reignited the field of RAS therapeutics. To signal, oncogenic KRAS4B not only requires a sufficient nucleotide exchange, but also needs to recruit effectors by exposing its effector-binding sites while anchoring to plasma membrane where KRAS4B-mediated signaling events occur. Phosphodiesterase-{delta} plays an important role in sequestering KRAS4B from the cytoplasm and targeting it to cellular membranes. In this work, we have designed a drug LIG1 using lipid-based formulation to directly target both the switch-II pocket of KRAS4B-G12D and phosphodiesterase-{delta}. LIG1 was found to lock KRAS4B in its GDP-bound state while the effector-binding domain is blocked by the interface of the plasma membrane which hinders the nucleotide exchange while simultaneously it can affect the GTP-bound KRAS4B to shift from an active state to its inactive state. LIG1 is also observed to stably accommodate itself in the prenyl-binding pocket of phosphodiesterase-{delta} which impairs KRAS4B enrichment at the membrane and suppress the proliferation of KRAS4B-dependent cancer cells. In this work we report a drug based on lipid-based formulation that can foster drug discovery efforts for the targeting of oncogenes of the RAS family and beyond.",

Phosphorylation of cMyBP-C, which reduces binding of cMyBP-C to actin or myosin, is often decreased in heart failure (HF) patients, and is cardioprotective in model systems for HF. Therefore, cMyBP-C is a potential target for HF drugs that mimic phosphorylation and/or perturb its interactions with actin or myosin. We labeled actin with fluorescein-5-maleimide (FMAL), and the C0-C2 fragment of cMyBP-C (cC0-C2) with tetramethyl rhodamine (TMR). We performed two complementary high-throughput screens (HTS) on an FDA-approved drug library, to discover small molecules that specifically bind to cMyBP-C and affect its interactions with actin or myosin, using fluorescence lifetime (FLT) detection. We first excited FMAL and detected its FLT, to measure changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from FMAL (donor) to TMR (acceptor), indicating binding and/or structural changes in the protein complex. Using the same samples, we then excited TMR directly, using a longer wavelength laser, to detect the effects of compounds on the environmentally sensitive FLT of TMR, to identify compounds that bind directly to cC0-C2. Secondary assays, performed on selected modulators with the most promising effects in the primary HTS assays, characterized specificity of these compounds for phosphorylated versus unphosphorylated cC0-C2 and for cC0-C2 versus C1-C2 of fast skeletal muscle (fskC1-C2). A subset of identified compounds modulated ATPase activity in cardiac and/or skeletal myofibrils. These assays establish feasibility for discovery of small-molecule modulators of the cMyBP-C-actin/myosin interaction, with the ultimate goal of developing therapies for HF.",

The speed of DNA exit is controlled by friction forces that limit the molecular mobility, but the nature of this friction is unknown. We introduce a method to probe the mobility of the tightly confined DNA by measuring DNA exit from phage phi29 capsids with optical tweezers. We measure extremely low initial exit velocity, a regime of exponentially increasing velocity, stochastic pausing that dominates the kinetics, and large dynamic heterogeneity. Measurements with variable applied force provide evidence that the initial velocity is controlled by DNA-DNA sliding friction, consistent with a Frenkel-Kontorova model for nanoscale friction. We confirm several aspects of the ejection dynamics predicted by theoretical models. Features of the pausing suggest it is connected to the phenomenon of \"clogging\" in soft-matter systems. Our results provide evidence that DNA-DNA friction and clogging control the DNA exit dynamics, but that this friction does not significantly affect DNA packaging.",

Directed evolution is used to develop a highly sensitive (EC50= 20 uM) and specific biosensor for the key amaryllidaceae alkaloid branchpoint 4-OMethylnorbelladine. A machine learning model (MutComputeX) was subsequently developed and used to generate activity-enriched variants of a plant methyltransferase, which were rapidly screened with the biosensor.

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease affecting epithelial ion transport, resulting in thickened mucus and impaired mucociliary clearance. Persons with CF (pwCF) experience life- long respiratory mucosal infections caused by a diverse array of opportunists, and these infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality for pwCF. In recent years, there has been increased appreciation for the range and diversity of microbes in CF-related respiratory infections. Introduction of new therapeutics and improved detection methodology has revealed CF related opportunists such as Achromobacter xylosoxidans (Ax). Ax is a Gram-negative bacterial species that is widely distributed in the environment and has been increasingly observed in sputa and other samples from pwCF; typically Ax infections occur in patients in later stages of CF disease. In this study, we characterized CF clinical isolates of Ax and tested colonization and persistence of Ax in respiratory infection using immortalized human CF respiratory epithelial cells and BALB/c mice. Genomic analyses of clinical Ax isolates showed homologs for factors involved in flagellar synthesis, antibiotic resistance, and toxin secretion systems. Ax isolates adhered to polarized CFBE14o- human immortalized CF bronchial epithelial cells and caused significant cytotoxicity and depolarization. Ax colonized and persisted in mouse lung for up to 72 hours post infection, with inflammatory consequences that include increased neutrophilia, lung damage, cytokine production, and mortality. Transcript profiling reveled differential expression of Ax genes during growth in SCFM2 synthetic CF sputum media. Based on these results, we conclude that Ax is an opportunistic pathogen of significance in CF.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory virus infections are a leading cause of disease worldwide with multiple viruses detected in 20-30% of cases and several viruses simultaneously circulating. Some infections with viral copathogens have been shown to result in reduced pathogenicity while other virus pairings can worsen disease. The mechanisms driving these dichotomous outcomes are likely variable and have only begun to be examined in the laboratory and clinic. To better understand viral-viral coinfections and predict potential mechanisms that result in distinct disease outcomes, we first systematically fit mathematical models to viral load data from ferrets infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) followed by influenza A virus (IAV) after 3 days. The results suggested that IAV reduced the rate of RSV production while RSV reduced the rate of IAV infected cell clearance. We then explored the realm of possible dynamics for scenarios not examined experimentally, including different infection order, coinfection timing, interaction mechanisms, and viral pairings. IAV coinfection with rhinovirus (RV) or SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) was examined by using human viral load data from single infections together with murine weight loss data from IAV-RV, RV-IAV, and IAV-CoV2 coinfections to guide the interpretation of the model results. Similar to the results with RSV-IAV coinfection, this analysis showed that the increased disease severity observed during murine IAV-RV or IAV-CoV2 coinfection was likely due to slower clearance of IAV infected cells by the other viruses. On the contrary, the improved outcome when IAV followed RV could be replicated when the rate of RV infected cell clearance was reduced by IAV. Simulating viral-viral coinfections in this way provides new insights about how viral-viral interactions can regulate disease severity during coinfection and yields testable hypotheses ripe for experimental evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Genomic and ancient DNA data have revolutionized palaeoanthropology and our vision of human evolution, with indisputable landmarks like the sequencing of Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes. Yet, using genetic data to identify, date and quantify evolutionary events--like ancient bottlenecks or admixture--is not straightforward, as inferences may depend on model assumptions. In the last two decades, the idea that Neanderthals and members of the Homo sapiens lineage interbred has gained momentum. From the status of unlikely theory, it has reached consensus among human evolutionary biologists. This theory is mainly supported by statistical approaches that depend on demographic models minimizing or ignoring population structure, despite its widespread occurrence and the fact that when ignored, population structure can lead to infer spurious demographic events. We simulated genomic data under a structured and admixture-free model of human evolution, and found that all the tested admixture approaches identified long Neanderthal fragments in our simulated genomes and an admixture event that never took place. We also observed that several published admixture models failed to predict important empirical diversity or admixture statistics, and that our model was best at predicting these statistics jointly. Our results suggest that models accounting for population structure are fundamental to improve our understanding of human evolution, and that admixture between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens needs to be re-evaluated in the light of structured models. Beyond the Neanderthal case, we argue that ancient hybridization events, which are increasingly documented in many species, including with other hominins, may also benefit from such reevaluation.\n\nSignificance statementThe idea that Neanderthals and some ancestral Homo sapiens populations interbred has gained momentum in the last two decades. Yet, this theory is mainly supported by statistical approaches that assume highly simplified models of hominin evolution. A major issue is that these methods have been poorly tested in the context of population structure, despite its widespread occurrence in many vertebrate species. We simulated data under a structured model and found that all tested methods identified spurious admixture events, suggesting a lack of robustness to population structure. Besides, our structured model was better at predicting several key genomic statistics than the tested admixture models. This suggests that admixture should be re-evaluated in the light of population structure, in hominins and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Assessing dynamic processes at single molecule scales is key toward capturing life at the level of its molecular actors. Widefield superresolution methods, such as STORM, PALM, and PAINT, provide nanoscale localization accuracy, even when distances between fluorescently labeled single molecules (\"emitters\") fall below lights diffraction limit. However, as these superresolution methods rely on rare photophysical events to distinguish emitters from both each other and background, they are largely limited to static samples. In contrast, here we leverage spatiotemporal correlations of dynamic widefield imaging data to extend superresolution to simultaneous multiple emitter tracking without relying on photodynamics even as emitter distances from one another fall below the diffraction limit. We simultaneously determine emitter numbers and their tracks (localization and linking) with the same localization accuracy per frame as widefield superresolution does for immobilized emitters under similar imaging conditions ({approx}50 nm). We demonstrate our results for both in cellulo data and, for benchmarking purposes, on synthetic data. To this end, we avoid the existing tracking paradigm relying on completely or partially separating the tasks of emitter number determination, localization of each emitter, and linking emitter positions across frames. Instead, we develop a fully joint posterior distribution over the quantities of interest, including emitter tracks and their total, otherwise unknown, number within the Bayesian nonparametric paradigm. Our posterior quantifies the full uncertainty over emitter numbers and their associated tracks propagated from origins including shot noise and camera artefacts, pixelation, stochastic background, and out-of-focus motion. Finally, it remains accurate in more crowded regimes where alternative tracking tools cannot be applied.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum has been implicated in the regulation of social behavior. Its influence is thought to arise from communication, via the thalamus, to forebrain regions integral in the expression of social interactions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, the signals encoded or the nature of the communication between the cerebellum and these brain regions remains poorly understood. Here, we describe an approach that overcomes technical challenges in exploring the coordination of distant brain regions at high temporal and spatial resolution during social behavior. We developed the E-Scope, an electrophysiology-integrated miniature microscope, to synchronously measure extracellular electrical activity in the cerebellum along with calcium imaging of the ACC. This single coaxial cable device combined these data streams to provide a powerful tool to monitor the activity of distant brain regions in freely behaving animals. During social behavior, we recorded the spike timing of multiple single units in cerebellar right Crus I (RCrus I) Purkinje cells (PCs) or dentate nucleus (DN) neurons while synchronously imaging calcium transients in contralateral ACC neurons. We find that during social interactions, a significant subpopulation of cerebellar PCs were robustly inhibited, while most modulated neurons in the DN were activated. As expected, we find that there are higher correlations in the activity of cerebellar and ACC neurons that are similarly excited or inhibited by social interaction than in the activity of those modulated in an opposing manner. Surprisingly, these distinctions in correlations largely disappear when only non-social bouts were analyzed, suggesting that cerebellar-cortical interactions were social behavior specific. Our work provides new insights into the complexity of cerebellar activation and co-modulation of the ACC during social behavior, and a valuable open-source tool for simultaneous, multimodal recordings in freely behaving mice.",

    "abstract": "Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines (PCVs) have substantially reduced the burden of disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus). However, protection is limited to vaccine serotypes, and when administered to children who are colonized with pneumococci at the time of vaccination, immune responses to the vaccine are blunted. Here, we investigate the potential of a killed whole cell pneumococcal vaccine (WCV) to reduce existing pneumococcal carriage and mucosal disease when given therapeutically to infant mice colonized with pneumococci. We show that a single dose of WCV reduced pneumococcal carriage density in an antibody-dependent manner. Therapeutic vaccination induced robust immune responses to pneumococcal surface antigens CbpA, PspA (family 1) and PiaA. In a co-infection model of otitis media, a single dose of WCV reduced pneumococcal middle ear infection. Lastly, in a two-dose model, therapeutic administration of WCV reduced nasal shedding of pneumococci. Taken together, our data demonstrate that WCV administered in colonized mice reduced pneumococcal density in the nasopharynx and the middle ear, and decreased shedding. A vaccine with similar properties in children would be beneficial in low and middle-income settings where pneumococcal carriage is high.\n\nImportanceAlthough typically asymptomatic, pneumococcal carriage plays an essential role in transmission and the development of disease. Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines (PCVs) have reduced the burden of pneumococcal disease worldwide. However, their use has increased carriage and disease caused by non-vaccine serotypes, prompting investigations into serotype-independent pneumococcal vaccines. An additional limitation of PCVs is immune hypo-responsiveness to vaccines in children carrying pneumococci at the time of vaccination. Therefore, there is great interest in next generation vaccines such as whole cell vaccines. In this study we investigate a pneumococcal whole cell vaccine (WCV) for it effect on carriage in mice that are already colonized at the time of vaccination. We show that this  therapeutic vaccination of mice can reduce pneumococcal carriage density, shedding and infection of the middle ear. Our study suggests that WCV could be beneficial in high burden settings where carriage at the time of vaccination is more common.",

    "abstract": "Development of functional neurons is a complex orchestration of several signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and homeostasis1. However, details about the involved factors are not fully understood. The balance of antioxidants and vitamins is important for neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and early neuronal development; thus, we hypothesized that ferroptosis--a lipid peroxidation dependent cell death modality that is inhibited by antioxidanats2,3--needs to be suppressed to gain neurons. Our study shows that removal of antioxidants diminishes neuronal development and laminar organization of cortical organoids. Intriguingly, impaired neuronal development in conditions lacking antioxidants can be fully restored when ferroptosis is specifically inhibited by ferrostatin-1, or neuronal differentiation occurs in the presence of sufficient amounts of vitamin A. Mechanistically, vitamin A activates the heterodimeric nuclear receptor complex Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR)/Retinoid X Receptor (RXR)4, which upregulates expression of the ferroptosis regulators GPX4, FSP1, GCH1, and ACSL3, amongst others. Therefore, our study reveals that above a certain threshold, vitamin A increases expression of essential cellular gatekeepers of lipid peroxidation. This study uncovers a critical process during early neuronal development, where suppression of ferroptosis by radical-trapping antioxidants or vitamin A is required to obtain maturing neurons and proper laminar organization in cortical organoids.",

However, the lack of specific techniques to study the ECM composition in preserved tissue structures remains a major obstacle to explaining ECM changes in response to extrinsic stimuli. To overcome this, we propose a novel strategy that uses multidimensional fluorescence microscopy and computational tools to quantify ECM composition in immunolabeled tissues and/or cell-derived matrices (CDM). This approach includes a detailed protocol for densitometric fluorescence calibration and procedures for image acquisition, processing, and automated quantification. Using this method, we present new data comparing collagen types I, III, and IV, and fibronectin contents in various tissues. These results emphasize the importance of studying ECM composition in situ under both normal homeostatic and disease conditions.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=135 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/535641v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1203e08org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c88c1borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1664ac2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b63154_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Although supervised learning based denoising methods have shown prominent advances in eliminating the noise-induced artifacts, the requirement of a large amount of high-quality training data severely limits their applications. Here we developed a pixel-realignment-based self-supervised denoising framework for SIM (PRS-SIM) that trains an SIM image denoiser with only noisy data and substantially removes the reconstruction artifacts. We demonstrated that PRS-SIM generates artifact-free images with 10-fold less fluorescence than ordinary imaging conditions while achieving comparable super-resolution capability to the ground truth (GT). Moreover, the proposed method is compatible with multiple SIM modalities such as total internal reflective fluorescence SIM (TIRF-SIM), three-dimensional SIM (3D-SIM), lattice light-sheet SIM (LLS-SIM), and non-linear SIM (NL-SIM). With PRS-SIM, we achieved long-term super-resolution live-cell imaging of various bioprocesses, revealing the clustered distribution of clathrin coated pits and detailed interaction dynamics of multiple organelles and the cytoskeleton.",

Yet, it remains unclear how mutations in proteins essential for centrosome biogenesis impact embryonic kidney development. Here, we examined the consequences of conditional deletion of a ciliopathy gene, Cep120, in the two nephron progenitor niches of the embryonic kidney. Cep120 loss led to reduced abundance of both metanephric mesenchyme and ureteric bud progenitor populations. This was due to a combination of delayed mitosis, increased apoptosis, and premature differentiation of progenitor cells. These defects resulted in dysplastic kidneys at birth, which rapidly formed cysts, displayed increased interstitial fibrosis, and decline in filtration function. RNA sequencing of embryonic and postnatal kidneys from Cep120-null mice identified changes in pathways essential for branching morphogenesis, cystogenesis and fibrosis. Our study defines the cellular and developmental defects caused by centrosome dysfunction during kidney development, and identifies new therapeutic targets for renal centrosomopathies.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=190 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/535568v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@198c93forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c4750dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e0c829org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17512c3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsDefective centrosome biogenesis in nephron progenitors causes:\n\nO_LIReduced abundance of metanephric mesenchyme and premature differentiation into tubular structures\nC_LIO_LIAbnormal branching morphogenesis leading to reduced nephron endowment and smaller kidneys\nC_LIO_LIChanges in cell-autonomous and paracrine signaling that drive cystogenesis and fibrosis\nC_LIO_LIUnique cellular and developmental defects when compared to Pkd1 knockout models\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The house mouse, Mus musculus, is an exceptional model system, combining genetic tractability with close homology to human biology. Gestation in mouse development lasts just under three weeks, a period during which its genome orchestrates the astonishing transformation of a single cell zygote into a free-living pup composed of >500 million cells. Towards a global framework for exploring mammalian development, we applied single cell combinatorial indexing (sci-*) to profile the transcriptional states of 12.4 million nuclei from 83 precisely staged embryos spanning late gastrulation (embryonic day 8 or E8) to birth (postnatal day 0 or P0), with 2-hr temporal resolution during somitogenesis, 6-hr resolution through to birth, and 20-min resolution during the immediate postpartum period. From these data (E8 to P0), we annotate dozens of trajectories and hundreds of cell types and perform deeper analyses of the unfolding of the posterior embryo during somitogenesis as well as the ontogenesis of the kidney, mesenchyme, retina, and early neurons. Finally, we leverage the depth and temporal resolution of these whole embryo snapshots, together with other published data, to construct and curate a rooted tree of cell type relationships that spans mouse development from zygote to pup. Throughout this tree, we systematically nominate sets of transcription factors (TFs) and other genes as candidate drivers of the in vivo differentiation of hundreds of mammalian cell types. Remarkably, the most dramatic shifts in transcriptional state are observed in a restricted set of cell types in the hours immediately following birth, and presumably underlie the massive changes in physiology that must accompany the successful transition of a placental mammal to extrauterine life.",

Tumor cells invade along varied migratory tracks, following neural cell strands or extracellular matrix around blood vessels, resembling neuron progenitors during brain development.

We found that N-cadherin differentially regulates pediatric high-grade glioma collective migration according to the microenvironment, inhibiting invasion of extracellular matrix but stimulating migration on neurons or astrocytes. Migrating leader cells exhibited faster endocytosis of N-cadherin and {beta}-catenin and increased proliferation and nuclear Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) relative to follower cells. YAP1 localization was regulated by cell density, and inhibition of YAP1 and its paralog TAZ decreased N-cadherin internalization and retarded migration. Therefore, feedback between YAP1/TAZ and N-cadherin recycling regulates leader-follower phenotypic identity and differential migration on extracellular matrix and neural substrates.",
