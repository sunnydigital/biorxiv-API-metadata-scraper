    "abstract": "Microbial strategies for resource use are an essential determinant of their fitness in complex habitats. When facing environments with multiple nutrients, microbes often use them sequentially according to a preference hierarchy, resulting in well-known patterns of diauxic growth. In theory, the evolutionary diversification of metabolic hierarchies could represent a mechanism supporting coexistence and biodiversity by enabling temporal segregation of niches. Despite this ecologically critical role, the extent to which substrate preference hierarchies can evolve and diversify remains largely unexplored. Here we used genome-scale metabolic modeling to systematically explore the evolution of metabolic hierarchies across a vast space of metabolic network genotypes. We find that only a limited number of metabolic hierarchies can readily evolve, corresponding to the most commonly observed hierarchies in genome-derived models. We further show how the evolution of novel hierarchies is constrained by the architecture of central metabolism, which determines both the propensity to change ranks between pairs of substrates and the effect of specific reactions on hierarchy evolution. Our analysis sheds light on the genetic and mechanistic determinants of microbial metabolic hierarchies, opening new research avenues to understand their evolution, evolvability and ecology.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of flowering plants are comprised of multiple chromosomes. Their copy number and composition can be dynamic within and among individual plants due to uneven replication of the chromosomes and homologous recombination. Nonetheless, despite their functional importance, the level of mitogenome conservation within species remains understudied. Whether the ontogenetic variation translates to evolution of mitogenome composition over generations is currently unknown. Here we show that the mitochondrial chromosome composition of the seagrass Zostera marina is conserved among worldwide populations that diverged ca 350,000 years ago. Using long-read sequencing we characterized the Z. marina mitochondrial genome and inferred the repertoire of recombination-induced configurations of its eight chromosomes. To characterize the chromosome composition worldwide and study its evolution we examined the mitogenome in Z. marina meristematic region sampled in 16 populations from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Our results reveal a striking similarity in the chromosome copy number suggesting stable equal proportions among distantly related populations and a high conservation of the mitochondrial genome within the plant germline, despite a notable variability during individual ontogenesis. Our study supplies a link between observations of dynamic mitogenomes at the level of plant individuals and long-term mitochondrial evolution.\n\nSignificance statementExtensive studies on evolution of plant mitochondria in individual plants revealed great variability of the mitogenome architecture across tissues, however, data on the mitochondrion evolution at the population level is still scarce. We show that the mitochondrial genome architecture in a keystone marine plant, Zostera marina, remained conserved over ca. 350,000 years worldwide. We suggest that the extreme conservation of the Z. marina mitochondria is a manifestation of streamlined mitochondria inheritance over plant generations, e.g., via a plant germline.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) models are used extensively to study human behavior. These rely on normative models of behavior and stress interpretability over predictive capabilities. More recently, neural network models have emerged as a descriptive modeling paradigm that is capable of high predictive power yet with limited interpretability. Here, we seek to augment the expressiveness of theoretical RL models with the high flexibility and predictive power of neural networks. We introduce a novel framework, which we term theoretical-RNN (t-RNN), whereby a recurrent neural network is trained to predict trial-by-trial behavior and to infer theoretical RL parameters using artificial data of RL agents performing a two-armed bandit task. In three studies, we then examined the use of our approach to dynamically predict unseen behavior along with time-varying theoretical RL parameters. We first validate our approach using synthetic data with known RL parameters. Next, as a proof-of-concept, we applied our framework to two independent datasets of humans performing the same task. In the first dataset, we describe differences in theoretical RL parameters dynamic among clinical psychiatric vs. healthy controls. In the second dataset, we show that the exploration strategies of humans varied dynamically in response to task phase and difficulty. For all analyses, we found better performance in the prediction of actions for t-RNN compared to the stationary maximum-likelihood RL method. We discuss the use of neural networks to facilitate the estimation of latent RL parameters underlying choice behavior.\n\nAuthor summaryCurrently, neural network models fitted directly to behavioral human data are thought to dramatically outperform theoretical computational models in terms of predictive accuracy. However, these networks do not provide a clear theoretical interpretation of the mechanisms underlying the observed behavior. Generating plausible theoretical explanations for observed human data is a major goal in computational neuroscience. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept for a novel method where a recurrent neural network (RNN) is trained on artificial data generated from a known theoretical model to predict both trial-by-trial actions and theoretical parameters. We then freeze the RNN weights and use it to predict both actions and theoretical parameters of empirical data. We first validate our approach using synthetic data where the theoretical parameters are known. We then show, using two empirical datasets, that our approach allows dynamic estimation of latent parameters while providing better action predictions compared to theoretical models fitted with a maximum-likelihood approach. This proof-of-concept suggests that neural networks can be trained to predict meaningful time-varying theoretical parameters.",

We demonstrate that GPT-4, a highly potent large language model, can automatically and accurately annotate cell types by utilizing marker gene information generated from standard single-cell RNA-seq analysis pipelines.

    "abstract": "Tumor endothelial cells (TECs) actively repress inflammatory responses and maintain an immune-excluded tumor phenotype. However, the molecular mechanisms that sustain TEC-mediated immunosuppression remain largely elusive. Here, we show that autophagy ablation in TECs boosts antitumor immunity by supporting infiltration and effector function of T cells, thereby restricting melanoma growth. In melanoma-bearing mice, loss of TEC autophagy leads to the transcriptional expression of an immunostimulatory/inflammatory TEC phenotype driven by heightened NF-kB and STING signaling. In line, single-cell transcriptomic datasets from melanoma patients disclose an enriched InflammatoryHigh/AutophagyLow TEC phenotype in correlation with clinical responses to immunotherapy. Congruently, patients responding to immunotherapy exhibit an increased presence of inflamed vessels, interfacing with infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, STING-dependent immunity in TECs is not critical for the immunomodulatory effects of autophagy ablation, since NF-kB-driven inflammation remains functional in STING/ATG5 double knockout TECs. Hence, autophagy is a principal tumor vascular anti-inflammatory mechanism dampening melanoma antitumor immunity.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is causing an increase in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves. In birds, changes in environmental temperature during the developmental period can affect growth, metabolism, and temperature tolerance of the offspring. We know little about whether such changes remain to adulthood, which is important to understand the links between climate change, development, and fitness. We investigated if phenotypic consequences of the thermal environment in early life remained in adulthood by raising Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) under simulated heatwave- or control conditions from hatching until halfway through the growth period, and then in a common garden until reproductively mature. We measured biometric and thermoregulatory (metabolic heat production [MHP], evaporative water and heat loss [EWL, EHL] and body temperature) responses to variation in ambient temperature at the end of the heatwave treatment and in adulthood. Developmental temperature did not affect body mass or wing length. However, warm birds had lower MHP than control birds at the end of the heat wave period and, in the warmest temperature studied (40{degrees}C), warm birds had higher evaporative cooling capacity than control birds. None of the effects found at the end of the heatwave period remained until adulthood. This implies that chicks exposed to higher temperatures could be more prepared to counter heat stress as juveniles, but that they do not enjoy any advantages of such developmental conditions when facing high temperatures as adults.",

    "abstract": "0.Essential tremor (ET) is a neurological disorder characterized by involuntary oscillations of the limbs. Previous studies have hypothesized that ET was a cerebellar disorder and reported impairments in motor adaptation. However, recent advances have highlighted that motor adaptation involved several components linked to anticipation and control, all dependent on cerebellum, and the specific alteration of adaptation of ET has not been identified. To address this question we investigated behavioural markers of adaptation in ET patients (n=20) and age-matched healthy volunteers (n=20) in saccadic and upper limb adaptation tasks, probing compensation for target jumps and for velocity-dependent force fields, respectively. We found that both groups adapted their movements to the novel contexts, however, ET patients adapted to a lesser extent compared to healthy volunteers. Importantly, we decomposed movements into components linked to anticipation, preserved here, and real-time execution, which were responsible for the adaptation deficit. Altogether, our results suggest that execution deficits may be a specific functional consequence of the alteration of neural pathways associated with ET.\n\nSignificance StatementWe tested Essential Tremor patients adaptation abilities in classical tasks including saccadic adaptation to target jumps and reaching adaptation to force field disturbances. Patients adaptation was present but impaired in both tasks. Interestingly, the deficits were mainly present during movement execution, while the anticipatory components of movements were similar to healthy volunteers. These findings reinforce the hypothesis of a cerebellar origin for essential tremor and details the motor adaptation impairments previously found in this disorder.",

This reprogramming is critical in determining the outcome of infection or colonisation.

Applying dual perturb-seq to the intracellular pathogen Toxoplasma gondii, we are able to identify previously uncharacterised effector proteins and directly infer their function from the transcriptomic data. We show that TgGRA59 contributes to the export of other effector proteins from the parasite into the host cell and identify a novel effector, TgSOS1, that is necessary for sustained host STAT6 signalling and thereby contributes to parasite immune evasion and persistence. Together, this work demonstrates a novel tool that can be broadly adapted to interrogate host-microbe transcriptional interactions and reveal mechanisms of infection and immune evasion.",

    "abstract": "A protein kinase DYRK1A encoded in human chromosome-21 is the major contributor for multiple symptoms observed in Down syndrome patients. In addition, DYRK1A dysfunction has been associated with various neuronal disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer disease. Here we identified FAM53C as a novel suppressive binding partner of DYRK1A. FAM53C bound to the catalytic kinase domain of DYRK1A, whereas DCAF7/WDR68, the major known DYRK1A-binding protein, binds to its N-terminal domain. The binding of FAM53C inhibited the protein kinase activity of DYRK1A to itself and an exogenous substrate MAPT/Tau. FAM53C did not bind directly to DCAF7/WDR68, whereas DYRK1A tethered FAM53C and DCAF7/WDR68 by binding concurrently to both of them. DYRK1A possesses a nuclear localization signal and accumulates in the nucleus when overexpressed in cells. FAM53C induced cytoplasmic re-localization of DYRK1A and DCAF7/WDR68. FAM53C is thus a binding suppressor of DYRK1A, anchoring it in an inactive state in the cytoplasm. The results explain for the first time why endogenous DYRK1A is distributed in the cytoplasm in the normal brain tissues. FAM53C-dependent regulation of DYRK1A may play a significant role in gene expression modification caused by DYRK1A.",

The study found that the addition of antibiotics/antimycotics (10,000 g/mL) to the growth media increased the environmental metrics, such as the cumulative energy demand and global warming potential, by two orders of magnitude. To account for additional processing for animal cell culture, a scenario analysis was conducted to assess the potential environmental impacts of growth medium production with varying level of refinement required for the input components.

The aim of this study was to characterize longitudinal tumor immune microenvironment (iTME) changes in order to find potential actionable targets to prevent GBM-induced immune evasion mechanisms.\nC_LIO_LIMethods: This study included 15 patient-matched treatment-naive WHO grade 4 primary (pGBM) and recurrent (rGBM) tumors. RNA and proteins extracted from fresh frozen tumor samples from matched pGBM and rGBM were profiled via transcriptomics and proteomics, respectively. A tissue microarray containing paired formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples was processed for spatial transcriptomics analysis.\nC_LIO_LIResults: Differentially expressed genes and proteins between pGBM and rGBM were involved in pathways responsible for synapse development and myelination which have been shown to play a role in GBM recurrence.

Expression of Fc{gamma} receptors and complement system genes such as FCGR1A (CD64), FCGR3A and C3 in rGBM samples were negatively correlated with TTR, whereas expression of DNMT1/3A, and SMARCA4, involved in DNA methylation, were positively correlated with TTR.

Although myocardial redox perturbations are known to accompany HFpEF, the specific role of mitochondrial oxidative stress has not been demonstrated yet.\n\nObjectiveBased on an observation that C57BL6/N - but not C57BL6/J - mice develop diastolic dysfunction when provided an ad libitum high-fat and 0.5% N({omega})-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (HFD+L-NAME) diet, we conducted a multi-cohort murine study to determine whether the loss of Nicotinamide Nucleotide Transhydrogenase (NNT), a mitochondrial transhydrogenase that couples NADPH:NADP+ to NADH:NAD+ homeostasis, protects mice from developing cardiometabolic alterations.\n\nMethods and ResultsTwo cohorts of 12-week-old male and female mice possessing wild-type (Nnt+/+) or deleted (Nnt-/-) NNT were challenged by HFD+L-NAME for 9 weeks (n = 6-10). Male Nnt+/+ mice developed obesity (23.2% {Delta}, P = 0.003), arterial hypertension (24 {+/-} 5 {Delta} mmHg, P = 0.023), impaired glucose tolerance (P = 0.006), and reduced maximal treadmill running distance (-172 {+/-} 73.1 {Delta} m, P = 0.006) following 9 weeks HFD+L-NAME, whereas male Nnt-/- mice did not. Female mice were protected from cardiometabolic dysfunction regardless of Nnt genotype. Cardiac functional and morphologic characterization revealed similar NNT-dependent and sex-specific increases in E/e (42.8 vs. 21.5, P < 0.001) and E/A (2.3 vs 1.4, P = 0.007) ratios, diastolic stiffness (0.09 vs 0.04 mmHg/L, P = 0.02), and myocardial fibrosis (P = 0.02). Unsupervised transcriptomic analysis identified distinct genetic and dietary signatures, wherein Nnt+/+ exhibited disproportionate perturbations in various mitochondrial oxidative pathways following HFD+L-NAME. Our search for putative transcriptional regulators identified NNT-dependent suppression of NAD+ dependent deacetylase Sirt3.\n\nConclusionsTaken together, these observations support that the genetic disruption of Nnt protects against both cardiac and metabolic consequences of HFD+L-NAME, thus highlighting a novel etiology-specific avenue for HFpEF therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Advances in deep learning have given rise to neural network models of the relationship between movement and brain activity that appear to far outperform prior approaches. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that enable people with paralysis to control external devices, such as robotic arms or computer cursors, might stand to benefit greatly from these advances. We tested recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on a challenging nonlinear BCI problem: decoding continuous bimanual movement of two computer cursors. Surprisingly, we found that although RNNs appeared to perform well in offline settings, they did so by overfitting to the temporal structure of the training data and failed to generalize to real-time neuroprosthetic control. In response, we developed a method that alters the temporal structure of the training data by dilating/compressing it in time and re-ordering it, which we show helps RNNs successfully generalize to the online setting. With this method, we demonstrate that a person with paralysis can control two computer cursors simultaneously, far outperforming standard linear methods. Our results provide evidence that preventing models from overfitting to temporal structure in training data may, in principle, aid in translating deep learning advances to the BCI setting, unlocking improved performance for challenging applications.",

    "abstract": "Among systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, neuropsychiatric symptoms are highly prevalent, being observed in up to 80% of adult and 95% of pediatric patients. Type 1 interferons, particularly interferon alpha (IFN), have been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE and its associated neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSLE). However, it remains unclear how type 1 interferon signaling in the central nervous system (CNS) might result in neuropsychiatric sequelae. In this study, we validate an NPSLE mouse model and find an elevated peripheral type 1 interferon signature alongside clinically relevant NPSLE symptoms such as anxiety and fatigue. Unbiased single-nucleus sequencing of the hindbrain and hippocampus revealed that interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were among the most highly upregulated genes in both regions and that gene pathways involved in cellular interaction and neuronal development were generally repressed among astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. Using image-based spatial transcriptomics, we found that the type 1 interferon signature is enriched as spatially distinct patches within the brain parenchyma of these mice. Our results suggest that type 1 interferon in the CNS may play an important mechanistic role in mediating NPSLE behavioral phenotypes by repressing general cellular communication pathways, and that type 1 interferon signaling modulators are a potential therapeutic option for NPSLE.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMouse model exhibits neuropsychiatric behaviors and elevated type 1 interferon.\nC_LIO_LIThe type 1 interferon gene signature is predominantly upregulated in the brain.\nC_LIO_LIInterferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are present in a spatial pattern in the brain.\nC_LIO_LICellular and synaptic interactions are generally repressed in cells with high ISGs.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to over 760 million cases and >6.8 million deaths worldwide. We developed a panel of human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein using Harbour H2L2 transgenic mice immunized with Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) (1). Representative antibodies from genetically-distinct families were evaluated for inhibition of replication-competent VSV expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike (rcVSV-S) in place of VSV-G. One mAb (denoted FG-10A3) inhibited infection of all rcVSV-S variants; its therapeutically-modified version, STI-9167, inhibited infection of all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron BA.1 and BA.2, and limited virus proliferation in vivo (1). To characterize the binding specificity and epitope of FG-10A3, we generated mAb-resistant rcVSV-S virions and performed structural analysis of the antibody/antigen complex using cryo-EM. FG-10A3/STI-9167 is a Class 1 antibody that prevents Spike-ACE2 binding by engaging a region within the Spike receptor binding motif (RBM). Sequencing of mAb-resistant rcVSV-S virions identified F486 as a critical residue for mAb neutralization, with structural analysis revealing that both the variable heavy and light chains of STI-9167 bound the disulfide-stabilized 470-490 loop at the Spike RBD tip. Interestingly, substitutions at position 486 were later observed in emerging variants of concern BA.2.75.2 and XBB. This work provides a predictive modeling strategy to define the neutralizing capacity and limitations of mAb therapeutics against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nImportanceThe COVID-19 pandemic remains a significant public health concern for the global population; development and characterization of therapeutics, especially ones that are broadly effective, will continue to be essential as SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies remain an effective therapeutic strategy to prevent virus infection and spread with the caveat that they interact with the circulating variants. The epitope and binding specificity of a broadly neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD antibody clone against many SARS-CoV-2 VOC was characterized by generating antibody-resistant virions coupled with cryo-EM structural analysis. This workflow can serve to predict the efficacy of antibody therapeutics against emerging variants and inform the design of therapeutics and vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Candida auris is a fungal pathogen of humans responsible for nosocomial infections with high mortality rates. High levels of resistance to antifungal drugs and environmental persistence mean these infections are difficult to treat and eradicate from the healthcare setting. Understanding the life cycle and the genetics of this fungus underpinning clinically relevant traits, such as antifungal resistance and virulence, is of the utmost importance to develop novel treatments and therapies. Epidemiological and genomic studies have identified five geographical clades (I-V), which display phenotypic and genomic differences. Aggregation of cells, a phenotype primarily of clade III strains, has been linked to reduced virulence in mouse and Galleria mellonella infection models. The aggregation phenotype has thus been associated with conferring an advantage for (skin) colonisation rather than for systemic infection. However, strains with different clade affiliations were compared to infer the effects of different morphologies on virulence. This makes it difficult to distinguish morphology-dependent causes from clade-specific genetic factors. Here, we identify two different types of aggregation: one induced by antifungal treatment which is a result of a cell separation defect; and a second which is controlled by growth conditions and only occurs in strains with the ability to aggregate. The latter aggregation type depends on an Als-family adhesin which is differentially expressed during aggregation in an aggregative C. auris strain. Finally, we demonstrate that macrophages cannot clear aggregates, suggesting that aggregation might after all provide a benefit during systemic infection and could facilitate long-term persistence in the host.\n\nAuthor SummaryCandida auris is a single-celled fungus, a yeast, that can cause severe infections in hospital patients. This fungus is difficult to treat because it is resistant to many antifungal drugs. Therefore, to understand the processes that enhance the virulence of this yeast with a view to developing new treatments. Previous studies have found that C. auris can form aggregates, or clumps of cells, which may play a role in how the fungus infects people. In this study, we identified two different types of aggregation in C. auris, one triggered by antifungal treatment, and another controlled by growth conditions. This discovery allowed us to study aggregate formation in the same genetic background. In doing so, we found that a certain protein, an Als-family adhesin, is involved in the aggregation process. Surprisingly, we also discovered that aggregates may promote infection by making it harder for the immune system to clear the yeast. This new understanding could help researchers develop better ways to fight C. auris infections.",

The contributions of non-coding genome, specifically the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in SMC dysfunction are relatively unexplored. We investigated the role of lncRNA TUG1 in the pathology of AAA. TUG1 was identified through lncRNA profiling in Angiotensin-II (Ang-II) treated SMCs. TUG1 was upregulated in Ang-II treated SMCs in vitro and its expression increased with progression of aneurysm in mouse model of Ang-II induced AAA. Ang-II induced TUG1 was blunted by inhibition of Notch signaling and TUG1 is demonstrated to be a transcriptional target of Notch. AAA tissues exhibited inversely correlated expression of TUG1 and SMC contractile markers. TUG1 knock-down via siRNA/shRNA increased SMC differentiation. ChIP, DNA-RNA IP, and RNA-IP experiments demonstrated that TUG1 interacts with transcriptional repressor KLF4 and aides in its recruitment to Myocardin promoter, thereby repressing SMC differentiation. In summary, we show a novel role for lncRNA TUG1 in Ang-II induced AAA wherein it modulates SMC differentiation via KLF4-Myocardin axis.",

Here, we present an expanded set of >100 vectors that utilizes universal primer annealing sequences, enabling protein tagging with a range of fluorescent and biochemical tags using five different selection markers.

    "abstract": "Luteinizing hormone (LH) induces ovulation by acting on its receptors in the mural granulosa cells that surround a mammalian oocyte in an ovarian follicle. However, much remains unknown about how activation of the LH receptor modifies the structure of the follicle such that the oocyte is released and the follicle remnants are transformed into the corpus luteum. The present study shows that the preovulatory surge of LH stimulates LH receptor-expressing granulosa cells, initially located almost entirely in the outer layers of the mural granulosa, to rapidly extend inwards, intercalating between other cells. The cellular ingression begins within 30 minutes of the peak of the LH surge, and the proportion of LH receptor-expressing cell bodies in the inner half of the mural granulosa layer increases until the time of ovulation, which occurs at about 10 hours after the LH peak. During this time, many of the initially flask-shaped cells appear to detach from the basal lamina, acquiring a rounder shape with multiple filipodia. Starting at about 4 hours after LH peak, the mural granulosa layer at the apical surface of the follicle where ovulation will occur begins to thin, and the basolateral surface develops invaginations and constrictions. LH stimulation of granulosa cell ingression may contribute to these changes in the follicular structure that enable ovulation.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/537855v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e52a3corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@137e02aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15e2392org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17168cb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Summary sentenceLH-induced ingression of LH receptor-expressing cells within the mural granulosa layer of the ovarian follicle is a new component in the complex sequence of structural changes that lead to ovulation.",

    "abstract": "We tackle the problem of estimating species divergence times, given a genome sequence from each species and a large known phylogenetic tree with a known structure (typically from one of the species). The number of transitions at each site from the first sequence to the other is assumed to be Poisson distributed, and only the parity of the number of transitions is observed. The detailed phylogenetic tree contains information about the transition rates in each site. We use this formulation to develop and analyze multiple estimators of the divergence between the species. To test our methods, we use mtDNA substitution statistics from the well-established Phylotree as a baseline for data simulation such that the substitution rate per site mimics the real-world observed rates. We evaluate our methods using simulated data and compare them to the Bayesian optimizing software BEAST2, showing that our proposed estimators are accurate for a wide range of divergence times and significantly outperform BEAST2. We then apply the proposed estimators on Neanderthal, Denisovan, and Chimpanzee mtDNA genomes to better estimate their TMRCA (Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor) with modern humans and find that their TMRCA is sub-stantially later, compared to values cited recently in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of gene expression plays a crucial role in the development and adaptation of organisms to changing environments. A population-based procedure used to investigate the genetic regulation of gene expression is eQTL mapping. Typically, the age of the population used for eQTL mapping at the time of sampling is strictly controlled. This is necessary because the developmental process causes changes in gene expression, complicating the interpretation of eQTL mapping experiments. However, organisms can differ in their \"developmental age\", even if they are of the same chronological age. As a result, eQTL patterns are affected by uncontrolled developmental variation in gene expression. The model organism C. elegans is particularly suited for studying the effect of developmental variation on eQTL mapping patterns. In a span of days C. elegans transitions from embryo through four larval stages to adult while undergoing massive changes to its transcriptome. Here we use C. elegans to investigate the effect of developmental age variation on eQTL patterns and an available normalization procedure. We used dynamical eQTL mapping, which includes developmental age as a cofactor, to separate the variation in development from genotypic variation and explain variation in gene expression levels. We compare classical single marker eQTL mapping and dynamical eQTL mapping using RNA-seq data of [~]200 multi-parental recombinant inbred lines of C. elegans. The results show that many eQTLs are actually caused by developmental variation, that most trans-bands are associated with developmental age and that dynamical eQTL mapping detects additional eQTLs not found with classical eQTL mapping.",

Beyond whole-organism studies in rodents or 2D monocultures, hormonal interactions and their effects on the breast microvasculature remains largely understudied. Recent methods to generate 3D microvessels on-chip have enabled direct observation of complex vascular processes; however, these models often use non-tissue-specific cell types, such as HUVEC and fibroblasts from various sources. Here, novel mammary-specific microvessels are generated by co-culturing primary breast endothelial cells and fibroblasts under optimized culture conditions. These microvessels are mechano-sensitive (to interstitial flow) and require endothelial-stromal interactions to develop fully perfusable vessels. These mammary-specific microvessels are also responsive to exogenous stimulation by sex hormones. When treated with combined E2 and P4, corresponding to the four phases of the menstrual cycle (period, follicular, ovular, and luteal), vascular remodeling and barrier function are altered in a phase-dependent manner. The presence of high E2 (ovulation) promotes vascular growth and remodeling, corresponding to high depletion of proangiogenic factors, whereas high P4 concentrations (luteal) promote vascular regression. The effects of combined E2 and P4 hormones are not only dose-dependent but also tissue-specific, as is shown by similarly treating non-tissue-specific HUVEC microvessels.",

In this study we report the use of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to compile a Human Breast Cell Atlas (HBCA) assembled from 55 donors that had undergone reduction mammoplasties or risk reduction mammoplasties. The data from more than 800,000 cells identified 41 cell subclusters distributed across the epithelial, immune, and stromal compartments. We found that the contribution of these different clusters varied according to the natural history of the tissue. Breast cancer risk modulating factors such as age, parity, and germline mutation affected the homeostatic cellular state of the breast in different ways however, none of the changes observed were restricted to any one cell type. Remarkably, we also found that immune cells from BRCA1/2 carriers had a distinct gene expression signature indicative of potential immune exhaustion. This suggests that immune escape mechanisms could manifest in non-cancerous tissues during very early stages of tumour initiation. Therefore, the Atlas presented here provides the research community with a rich resource that can be used as a reference for studies on the origins of breast cancer which could inform novel approaches for early detection and prevention.",

    "abstract": "Electrical and calcium signals in plants are one of the basic carriers of information transmitted over a long distance. Together with reactive oxygen species (ROS) waves, electrical and calcium signals can participate in cell-to-cell signaling, conveying information about different stimuli, e.g. abiotic stress, pathogen infection, or mechanical injury. There is no information on the ability of ROS to evoke systemic electrical or calcium signals in the model moss Physcomitrella and on the relationships between these responses. Here, we show that external application of hydrogen peroxide evokes electrical signals in the form of long-distance changes in the membrane potential, which transmit through the plant instantly after stimulation. The responses were calcium dependent, since their generation was inhibited by lanthanum, a calcium channel inhibitor (2 mM) or EDTA, a calcium chelator (0.5 mM). The electrical signals were partially dependent on glutamate receptor ion channels (GLR), since the knockout of GLR genes only slightly reduced the amplitude of the responses. The basal part of the gametophyte, which is rich in protonema cells, was the most sensitive to hydrogen peroxide. The measurements carried out on the protonema expressing fluorescent calcium biosensor GCaMP3 proved that. We also demonstrate upregulation of a stress-related gene which appears in a distant section of the moss 8 minutes after H2O2 treatment. The results help to understand the importance of both types of signals in the transmission of information about the appearance of ROS in the plant cell apoplast.",

    "abstract": "The Salicaceae family is of growing interest in the study of dioecy in plants because the sex determination region (SDR) has been shown to be highly dynamic, with differing locations and heterogametic systems between species. Without the ability to transform and regenerate Salix in tissue culture, previous studies investigating the mechanisms regulating sex in the genus Salix have been limited to genome resequencing and differential gene expression, which are mostly descriptive in nature, and functional validation of candidate sex determination genes has not yet been conducted. Here we used Arabidopsis to functionally characterize a suite of previously identified candidate genes involved in sex determination and sex dimorphism in the bioenergy shrub willow Salix purpurea. Six candidate master regulator genes for sex determination were heterologously expressed in Arabidopsis, followed by floral proteome analysis. In addition, 11 transcription factors with predicted roles in mediating sex dimorphism downstream of the SDR were tested using DAP-Seq in both male and female S. purpurea DNA. The results of this study provide further evidence to support models for the roles of ARR17 and GATA15 as master regulator genes of sex determination in S. purpurea, contributing to a regulatory system that is notably different from that of its sister genus Populus. Evidence was also obtained for the roles of two transcription factors, an AP2/ERF family gene and a homeodomain-like transcription factor, in downstream regulation of sex dimorphism.",

    "abstract": "Organisms use circadian clocks to synchronize physiological processes to anticipate the Earths day-night cycles and regulate responses to environmental stresses to gain competitive advantage1. While divergent genetic clocks have been studied extensively in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, a conserved circadian redox rhythm has only recently been reported and hypothesized to be a more ancient clock2, 3. However, it is controversial whether the redox rhythm serves as an independent clock and controls specific biological processes4. Here, we uncovered the coexistence of redox and genetic rhythms with distinct period lengths and transcriptional targets through concurrent metabolic and transcriptional time-course measurements in an Arabidopsis long-period clock mutant5. Analysis of the target genes indicated regulation of the immune-induced programmed cell death (PCD) by the redox rhythm. Moreover, this time-of-day-sensitive PCD was eliminated by redox perturbation and by blocking the signalling pathway of the plant defence hormones jasmonic acid/ethylene, while remaining intact in a genetic-clock-impaired line. We demonstrate that compared to robust genetic clocks, the more sensitive circadian redox rhythm serves as a signalling hub in regulating incidental energy-intensive processes, such as immune-induced PCD6, to provide organisms a flexible strategy to prevent metabolic overload caused by stress, a unique role for the redox oscillator.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRegulating microbial metabolic stability is an ever-challenging goal in the food industry to ensure the productivity and quality of fermented foods. The microbiome underlying traditional Chinese liquor fermentation is such a representative microbiome metabolism that is affected by many dynamic abiotic/biotic factors. The complex microbial activities bring beneficial qualities (complex and rich aroma profiles, etc.) to the fermented product, but can also cause unstable fermentation outcomes. Here, we designed a three-step experiment (abiotic regulation; biotic regulation; lab-scale validation) to explore which factors cause unstable fermentation outcomes and how to regulate microbiome metabolic functional stability accordingly.\n\nResultsWe found that 30.5% industrial fermentation of traditional Chinese liquor outcomes could be precisely predicted by initial abiotic factors. We could ensure the stability of partial fermentation batches by regulating the initial ratio of acidity to reducing sugar, moisture, and starch. Furthermore, in two representative unpredictable fermentation batches (named batch A and batch B), we found that unstable fermentation outcomes occurred even with similar initial abiotic factors after a dynamic three-phase fermentation. Unstable fermentation batches showed fluctuations in microbial community assembly that affected fermentation stability by altering the beneficial distribution (metabolic flux) of redundant metabolic pathways between yeasts and Lactobacilli. The metabolism of batch B was more stable than that of batch A due to the consistent overexpression of a specific set of bacterial metabolic genes. In repeated feed-batch fermentation processes, the difference in metabolic functional stability between the two batches was amplified 9.02 times. Batch B had significantly lower microbiome metabolic fluctuations than batch A, with higher robustness and lower complexity of the metabolic functional network. Moreover, we found that adjusting the initial microbial inoculation ratio could regulate both the metabolic beneficial distribution and temporal metabolic fluctuations of the microbiome to appropriately reduce the instability caused by biotic factors.\n\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates that rationally regulating initial parameters and microbial inoculation ratio is a practical strategy to optimize indigenous liquor fermentation. The stable microbial beneficial distribution and high metabolic robustness are essential to obtain the ideal microbiome metabolic stability. Our study provides insights and shows the feasibility of enhancing metabolic functional stability through initial conditions in dynamic microbial ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The neurotic personality has an impact on the regulation of basic negative emotions such as anger, fear, and sadness. There has been extensive research in search of functional connectivity biomarkers of neuroticism and basic negative emotions but there is a lack of research based on effective connectivity. In the current research, we intended to determine the significance of causal interaction of three large-scale resting-state networks - default mode, salience, and executive networks - to predict neuroticism and basic negative emotions. In this study, a large-scale human connectome project dataset comprising functional MRI scans and self-reported scores of neuroticism and negative emotions of 1079 subjects, was utilized. Spectral dynamic causal modelling and parametric empirical Bayes was used to estimate the subject-level effective connectivity parameters and their group-level associations with the neuroticism and emotional scores. Leave-one-out cross-validation using parametric empirical Bayes was employed for prediction analysis. Our results for heightened emotions showed that the self-connection of right hippocampus can predict individuals with high fear, self-connections of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex can predict individuals with high sadness. High anger, low sadness, and neuroticism scores of any emotion category except low fear, could not be predicted using triple network effective connectivity. Our findings revealed that the causal (directed) connections of the resting-state triple network can potentially serve as a connectomic signature for people with high and low fear, high sadness, low anger, and neuroticism with low fear.",

    "abstract": "Adult second language (L2) learning is a challenging enterprise inducing neuroplastic changes in the human brain. However, it remains unclear how the structural language connectome and its subnetworks change during adult L2-learning. The current study investigated longitudinal changes in white matter (WM) language networks in each hemisphere, as well as their interconnection, in a large group of Arabic-speaking adults who learned German intensively for six months. We found a significant increase in WM-connectivity within bilateral temporal-parietal semantic and phonological subnetworks and right temporal-frontal pathways mainly in the second half of the learning period. At the same time, WM-connectivity between the two hemispheres decreased significantly. Crucially, these changes in WM-connectivity are correlated with L2 performance. The observed changes in subnetworks of the two hemispheres suggest a network reconfiguration due to lexical learning. The reduced interhemispheric connectivity may indicate a key role of the corpus callosum in L2-learning by reducing the inhibition of the language-dominant left hemisphere. Our study highlights the dynamic changes within and across hemispheres in adult language-related networks driven by L2 learning.\n\nSignificanceThe neuroplastic changes induced by learning a second language (L2) in adulthood open up new perspectives for understanding brain function. The current study shows structural changes in the language network of Arabic native speakers who learned German intensively in two phases of three months each. We found a marked change in the left-hemispheric lexical-semantic language system and the right fronto-temporal pathway, accompanied by a decrease in white matter connectivity in the corpus callosum during L2 learning, which occurred mainly in the second period of L2 acquisition. The reduced interhemispheric connectivity suggests that the inhibitory role of the corpus callosum, relevant for native language processing, is reduced by L2 learning. Our findings demonstrate a clear experience-dependent structural plasticity in the human brain during L2 learning.",

    "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists are common type 2 diabetes medications that have been repurposed for adult chronic weight management. Clinical trials suggest this class may also be beneficial for obesity in pediatric populations. Since several GLP-1R agonists cross the blood-brain barrier, it is important to understand how postnatal developmental exposure to GLP-1R agonists might affect brain structure and function in adulthood. Toward that end, we systemically treated male and female C57BL/6 mice with the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 (0.5 mg/kg, twice daily) or saline from postnatal day 14 to 21, then allowed uninterrupted development to adulthood. Beginning at 7 weeks of age, we performed open field and marble burying tests to assess motor behavior and the spontaneous location recognition (SLR) task to assess hippocampal-dependent pattern separation and memory. Mice were sacrificed, and we counted ventral hippocampal mossy cells, as we have recently shown that most murine hippocampal neuronal GLP-1R is expressed in this cell population. We found that GLP-1R agonist treatment did not alter P14-P21 weight gain, but modestly reduced adult open field distance traveled and marble burying. Despite these motor changes, there was no effect on SLR memory performance or time spent investigating objects. Finally, we did not detect any changes in ventral mossy cell number using two different markers. These data suggest developmental exposure to GLP-1R agonists might have specific rather than global effects on behavior later in life and that extensive additional study is necessary to clarify how drug timing and dose affect distinct constellations of behavior in adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Since genome instability can drive cancer initiation and progression, cells have evolved highly effective and ubiquitous DNA Damage Response (DDR) programs. However, some cells, in skin for example, are normally exposed to high levels of DNA damaging agents. Whether such high-risk cells possess lineage-specific mechanisms that tailor DNA repair to the tissue remains largely unknown. Here we show, using melanoma as a model, that the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor MITF, a lineage addition oncogene that coordinates many aspects of melanocyte and melanoma biology, plays a non-transcriptional role in shaping the DDR. On exposure to DNA damaging agents, MITF is phosphorylated by ATM/DNA-PKcs, and unexpectedly its interactome is dramatically remodelled; most transcription (co)factors dissociate, and instead MITF interacts with the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex. Consequently, cells with high MITF levels accumulate stalled replication forks, and display defects in homologous recombination-mediated repair associated with impaired MRN recruitment to DNA damage. In agreement, high MITF levels are associated with increased SNV burden in melanoma. Significantly, the SUMOylation-defective MITF-E318K melanoma predisposition mutation recapitulates the effects of ATM/DNA-PKcs-phosphorylated MITF. Our data suggest that a non-transcriptional function of a lineage-restricted transcription factor contributes to a tissue-specialised modulation of the DDR that can impact cancer initiation.",

However, the role of insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) during the process of myocardial I/R remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the expression, distribution, and functionality of IGF2R in various I/R-associated models (such as reoxygenation, revascularization, and heart transplant). Loss-of-function studies (including myocardial conditional knockout and CRISPR interference) were performed to clarify the role of IGF2R in I/R injuries. Following hypoxia, IGF2R expression increased, but this effect was reversed upon restoration of oxygen levels. Loss of myocardial IGF2R was found to enhance the cardiac contractile functions, and reduced cell infiltration or cardiac fibrosis of I/R mouse models compared to the genotype control. CRISPR-inhibition of IGF2R decreased cell apoptotic death under hypoxia. RNA sequencing analysis indicated that myocardial IGF2R played a critical role in regulating the inflammatory response, innate immune response, and apoptotic process following I/R. Integrated analysis of the mRNA profiling, pulldown assays, and mass spectrometry identified granulocyte-specific factors as potential targets of myocardial IGF2R in the injured heart. In conclusion, myocardial IGF2R emerges as a promising therapeutic target to ameliorate inflammation or fibrosis following I/R injuries.",

    "abstract": "Kryptolebias marmoratus (Kmar), a teleost fish of the order Cyprinodontiformes, has a suite of unique phenotypes and behaviors not observed in other fishes. Many of these phenotypes are discrete and highly plastic -varying over time within an individual, and in some cases reversible. Kmar and its interfertile sister species, K. hermaphroditus, are the only known self-fertile vertebrates. This unusual sexual mode has the potential to provide unique insights into the regulation of vertebrate sexual development, and also lends itself to genetics. Kmar is easily adapted to the lab and requires little maintenance. However, its internal fertilization and small clutch size limits its experimental use. To support Kmar as a genetic model, we compared alternative husbandry techniques to maximize recovery of early cleavage-stage embryos. We find that frequent egg collection enhances yield, and that protease treatment promotes the greatest hatching successes from diapause. We completed a forward mutagenesis screen and recovered several mutant lines that serve as important tools for genetics in this model. Several will serve as useful viable recessive markers for marking crosses. Importantly, the mutant kissylips lays embryos at twice the rate of wild-type. Combining frequent egg collection with the kissylips mutant background allows for a substantial enhancement of early embryo yield. These improvements were sufficient to allow experimental analysis of early development and the successful mono- and bi-allelic targeted knockout of an endogenous tyrosinase gene with CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases. Collectively, these tools will facilitate modern developmental genetics in this fascinating fish, leading to future insights into the regulation of plasticity.",

Chemical conversion of 4sU before sequencing induces T-to-C mismatches in reads sequenced from labelled RNA, allowing to obtain total and labelled RNA expression profiles from a single sequencing library. Cytotoxicity due to extended periods of labelling or high 4sU concentrations has been described, but the effects of extensive 4sU labelling on expression estimates from nucleotide conversion RNA-seq have not been studied. Here, we performed nucleotide conversion RNA-seq with escalating doses of 4sU with short-term labelling (1h) and over a progressive time course (up to 2h) in different cell lines. With high concentrations or at later time points, expression estimates were biased in an RNA half-life dependent manner. We show that bias arose by a combination of reduced mappability of reads carrying multiple conversions, and a global, unspecific underrepresentation of labelled RNA due to impaired reverse transcription efficiency and potentially global reduction of RNA synthesis. We developed a computational tool to rescue unmappable reads, which performed favourably compared to previous read mappers, and a statistical method, which could fully remove remaining bias.

    "abstract": "A causal relationship exists among the aging process, organ decay and dis-function, and the occurrence of various diseases including cancer. A genetically engineered mouse model, termed EklfK74R/K74R or Eklf(K74R), carrying mutation on the well-conserved sumoylation site of the hematopoietic transcription factor KLF1/ EKLF has been generated that possesses extended lifespan and healthy characteristics including cancer resistance. We show that the high anti-cancer capability of the Eklf(K74R) mice are gender-, age-and genetic background-independent. Significantly, the anti-cancer capability and extended lifespan characteristics of Eklf(K74R) mice could be transferred to wild-type mice via transplantation of their bone marrow mononuclear cells. Targeted/global gene expression profiling analysis has identified changes of the expression of specific proteins and cellular pathways in the leukocytes of the Eklf(K74R) that are in the directions of anti-cancer and/or anti-aging. This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing a novel hematopoietic/ blood system for long-term anti-cancer and, potentially, for anti-aging.",

    "abstract": "As the first step of food ingestion, the swallow is under rigorous sensorimotor control. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying swallow control at a molecular and circuitry level remain largely unknown. Here, we find that mutation of the mechanotransduction channel genes nompC, Tmc, or piezo impairs the regular pumping rhythm of the cibarium during feeding of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. A group of multi-dendritic mechanosensory neurons, which co-express the three channels, wrap the cibarium and are crucial for coordinating the filling and emptying of the cibarium. Inhibition of them causes difficulty in food emptying in the cibarium, while their activation leads to difficulty in cibarium filling. Synaptic and functional connections are detected between the pharyngeal mechanosensory neurons and the motor circuit that controls swallow. This study elucidates the role of mechanosensation in swallow, and provides insights for a better understanding of the neural basis of food swallow.\n\nHighlightsnompC+, piezo+ and Tmc+ neurons in the pharynx sense mechanical force during swallowing\n\nPharyngeal mechanoreceptor neurons regulate swallow rhythm\n\nDysfunction of pharyngeal mechanosensory neurons causes dysphagia\n\nPharyngeal mechanosensory neurons connect with brain motor neurons to coordinate swallow pattern",

    "abstract": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are fat storage organelles critical for energy and lipid metabolism. Upon nutrient exhaustion, cells consume LDs via gradual lipolysis or via lipophagy, the en bloc uptake of LDs into the vacuole. Here, we show that LDs dock to the vacuolar membrane via a contact site that is required for lipophagy in yeast. The LD-localized LDO proteins carry an intrinsically disordered region that associates with vacuolar Vac8 to form vCLIP, the vacuolar-LD contact site. Nutrient limitation drives vCLIP formation, and its inactivation blocks lipophagy. Vac8 is sufficient to recruit LDs to cellular membranes. We establish a functional link between lipophagy and microautophagy of the nucleus, both requiring Vac8 to form respective contact sites upon metabolic stress. In sum, we unravel the molecular architecture of vCLIP, a contact site required for lipophagy, and find that Vac8 provides a platform for multiple and competing contact sites associated with autophagy.",

    "abstract": "Left-right patterning disturbance can cause severe birth defects, but it remains least understood of the three body axes. We uncovered an unexpected role for metabolic regulation in left-right patterning. Analysis of the first spatial transcriptome profile of left-right patterning revealed global activation of glycolysis, accompanied by right-sided expression of Bmp7 and genes regulating insulin growth factor signaling. Cardiomyocyte differentiation was left-biased, which may underlie the specification of heart looping orientation. This is consistent with known Bmp7 stimulation of glycolysis and glycolysis suppression of cardiomyocyte differentiation. Liver/lung laterality may be specified via similar metabolic regulation of endoderm differentiation. Myo1d, found to be left-sided, was shown to regulate gut looping in mice, zebrafish, and human. Together these findings indicate metabolic regulation of left-right patterning. This could underlie high incidence of heterotaxy-related birth defects in maternal diabetes, and the association of PFKP, allosteric enzyme regulating glycolysis, with heterotaxy. This transcriptome dataset will be invaluable for interrogating birth defects involving laterality disturbance.",
