    "abstract": "In Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), the absence of the subsarcolemmal dystrophin protein leads to repeated myofiber damages inducing cycles of muscle regeneration that is driven by muscle stem cells (MuSCs). With time, MuSC regenerative capacities are overwhelmed, leading to fibrosis and muscle atrophy. Whether MuSCs from DMD muscle have intrinsic defects that limit regenerative potential or are disrupted by their degenerative/regenerative environment is unclear. We investigated cell behavior and gene expression in human using MuSCs derived from DMD or healthy muscles. We found that proliferation, differentiation and fusion were not altered in DMD-MuSCs, but with time, they lost their myogenic identity twice as fast as healthy MuSCs. The rapid drift towards a fibroblast-like cell identity was observed at the clonal level, and resulted from the altered expression of epigenetic enzymes required to maintain the myogenic cell fate. Indeed, the re-expression of CBX3, SMC3, H2AFV and H3F3B prevented the MuSC identity drift. Amongst the epigenetic changes, a closing of chromatin at the gene encoding the transcription factor MEF2B caused a down-regulation of its expression and a loss of the myogenic fate. Thus, MEF2B is a key mediator of the myogenic identity in human MuSCs, that is altered in DMD pathology.",

KIV-2 is highly polymorphic in the population and accurate analysis is challenging. In this study, we present the DRAGEN KIV-2 CN caller, which utilizes short reads. Data across 166 WGS show that the caller has high accuracy, compared to optical mapping and can further phase [~]50% of the samples. We compared KIV-2 CN numbers to 24 previously postulated KIV-2 relevant SNVs, revealing that many are ineffective predictors of KIV-2 copy number. Population studies, including USA-based cohorts, showed distinct KIV-2 CN, distributions for European-, African-, and Hispanic-American populations and further underscored the limitations of SNV predictors. We demonstrate that the CN estimates correlate significantly with the available Lp(a) protein levels and that phasing is highly important.",

    "abstract": "DNA has shown great biocompatibility, programmable mechanical properties, and structural addressability at the nanometer scale, making it a versatile material for building high precision nanorobotics for biomedical applications. Herein, we present design principle, synthesis, and characterization of a DNA nanorobotic hand, called the \"NanoGripper\", that contains a palm and four bendable fingers as inspired by human hands, bird claws, and bacteriophages evolved in nature. Each NanoGripper finger has three phalanges connected by two flexible and rotatable joints that are bendable in response to binding to other entities. Functions of the NanoGripper have been enabled and driven by the interactions between moieties attached to the fingers and their binding partners. We showcase that the NanoGripper can be engineered to interact with and capture various objects with different dimensions, including gold nanoparticles, gold NanoUrchins, and SARS-CoV-2 virions. When carrying multiple DNA aptamer nanoswitches programmed to generate fluorescent signal enhanced on a photonic crystal platform, the NanoGripper functions as a sensitive viral biosensor that detects intact SARS-CoV-2 virions in human saliva with a limit of detection of [~] 100 copies/mL, providing RT-PCR equivalent sensitivity. Additionally, we use confocal microscopy to visualize how the NanoGripper-aptamer complex can effectively block viral entry into the host cells, indicating the viral inhibition. In summary, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a complex nanomachine that can be readily tailored for specific applications. The study highlights a path toward novel, feasible, and efficient solutions for the diagnosis and therapy of other diseases such as HIV and influenza.\n\nOne-sentence summaryDesign, synthesis, characterization, and functional showcase of a human-hand like designer DNA nanobot",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of a fluid flow within an open capillary channel depend on the fluids contact angle with the channel substrate, but determining the real value of the contact angle with the solid surface is an ominous problem in capillary microflows. The Lucas-Washburn law assumes a constant contact angle during the fluid motion; however, it is observed that the contact angle of the flowing liquid with the walls differs from its static (Young) value. Correlations for the dynamic contact angle have been proposed, and upon close inspection of Lucas-Washburn behavior in closed channels, a dynamic contact angle should be taken into account depending on the flow velocity. In this work, the dynamic contact angle in open-channel configurations is investigated using experimental data obtained with different liquids. It is shown that a dynamic contact angle must be taken into account in the early stages of the flow, i.e., at the beginning of the viscous regime when flow velocities are sufficiently high. Here, we found that amongst the different correlations for the dynamic contact angle, the Hamraoui correlation-- presenting the dynamic contact angle in terms of a friction coefficient--reproduces the experimental results while other correlations overpredict the fluid velocity in open channels.",

    "abstract": "The preponderance of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) in the eukaryotic proteome, and their ability to interact with each other, proteins, RNA, and DNA for functional purposes have made it important to quantitatively characterize their biophysical properties. Towards this end, we developed the transferable Self-Organized Polymer (SOP-IDP) model in order to calculate the properties of a number of IDPs. The calculated and measured radius of gyration values (Rgs) are in excellent agreement, with a correlation coefficient of 0.96. For AP180 and Epsin, the predicted and values obtained using Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy for the hydrodynamic radii (Rhs) are also in quantitative agreement. Strikingly, the calculated SAXS profiles for thirty six IDPs also nearly match the experiments. The dependence of Rg, the mean end-to-end distance (Re), and Rh obey the Flory scaling law, R {approx} aN0.59 ( = g, e, and h), suggesting that globally IDPs behave as polymers in a good solvent. The values of ag, ae, and ah are 0.21 nm, 0.53 nm, and 0.16 nm, respectively. Surprisingly, finite size corrections to scaling, expected on theoretical grounds, for all the three quantities are negligible. Sequence dependencies, masked in ensemble properties, emerge through a fine structure analyses of the conformational ensembles using a hierarchical clustering method. Typically, the ensemble of conformations partition into three distinct clusters, with differing extent of population and structural properties. The subpopulations could dictate phase separation tendencies and association with ligands. Without any adjustments to the three parameters in the SOP-IDP model, we obtained excellent agreement with paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) measurements for -synuclein. The transferable SOP-IDP model sets the stage for a number of promising applications, including the study of phase separation in IDPs and interactions with nucleic acids.",

We have engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli) to secrete a Shiga toxin, HlyE, which is a pore-forming protein that binds to HER2 receptors on breast cancer cells. This binding is facilitated by a nanobody expressed on the bacterias surface via the Ag43 autotransporter protein system. Our findings demonstrate that the nanobody efficiently binds to HER2+ cells in vitro, and we have utilized the YebF secretion system to secrete HlyE and kill the target cancer cells. Overall, our results highlight the potential of our engineered bacteria as an innovative strategy for breast cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Adoptive T cell therapy aims to achieve lasting tumour clearance, requiring enhanced engraftment and survival of the immune cells. Cytokines are paramount modulators of T cell survival and proliferation. Cytokine receptors signal via ligand-induced dimerization, and this principle has been hijacked utilising non-native dimerization domains. A major limitation of current technologies resides in the absence of a module that recapitulates the natural cytokine receptor heterodimeric pairing. To circumvent this, we created a new engineered cytokine receptor able to constitutively recreate receptor-heterodimer utilising the heterodimerization domain derived from the IgG1 antibody (dFab_CCR). We found that the signal delivered by the dFab_CCR-IL2 proficiently mimics the cytokine receptor heterodimerization, with transcriptomic signatures similar to that obtained by the activation of IL2 native receptor. Importantly, we found that this dimerization structure is agnostic, efficiently activating signaling through four cytokine receptor families.\n\nUsing a combination of in vivo and in vitro screening approaches, we characterized a library of 18 dFab_CCRs co-expressed with a clinically relevant solid tumor-specific GD2 CAR. Based on this characterization we suggest that the co-expression of either the common {beta}-chain GMCSF or the IL18 dFab_CCRs is optimal to improve CAR T cell expansion, engraftment, and efficacy.\n\nOur results demonstrate how the Fab dimerization is efficient and versatile in recapitulating a cytokine receptor heterodimerization signal. This module could be applied for the enhancement of adoptive T cell therapies, and therapies based on other immune cell types. Furthermore, these results provide a choice of cytokine signal to incorporate with adoptive T cells therapies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDespite therapeutic advancements, graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Pathogen and damage associated molecular patterns released following pre-transplant conditioning play an important role in the initiation of GVHD. However, the role of extracellular mitochondria as an endogenous danger signal has not been fully explored. Herein, we report that cytotoxic conditioning with radiation leads to mitochondrial fission and dysfunction and impaired induction of PINK-1/PARKIN-dependent mitophagy, specifically in the intestinal mucosal layer. This radiation-induced imbalance in mitochondrial dynamics leads to the expulsion of mitochondria from intestinal epithelial cells in a cell-death independent manner both in vitro in cell culture supernatants of the Caco-2 cell line and in vivo in plasma of BALB/c mice. Extracellular mitochondria released upon irradiation were damaged, with functional impairment in ATP production and, increased protein carbonylation. Transplantation of isolated damaged mitochondria along with HSCT and splenocytes in a C57BL6/J  BALB/c mouse model of GVHD aggravated the disease-induced mortality. In mixed lymphocyte reactions, pre-incubation of BALB/c stimulator cells with syngeneic extracellular mitochondria increased the activation and proliferation of C57BL6/J responder T cells. In a cohort of pediatric patients who underwent HSCT, fractionated irradiation given with their conditioning regimen increased the abundance of circulating extracellular mitochondria and correlated with the incidence of GVHD. Our results suggest that modulation of extracellular mitochondria could be a novel therapeutic target to prevent GVHD after HSCT.",

In our previous work, we identified sarbecovirus spike RBD group 1 and 2 bnAbs. We have now shown that many of these bnAbs can still neutralize highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the XBB.1.5. Structural studies revealed that group 1 bnAbs use recurrent germline encoded CDRH3 features to interact with a conserved RBD region that overlaps with class 4 bnAb site. Group 2 bnAbs recognize a less well-characterized \"site V\" on the RBD and destabilize spike trimer. The site V has remained largely unchanged in SARS-CoV- 2 variants and is highly conserved across diverse sarbecoviruses, making it a promising target for broad coronavirus vaccine development.

Multiple Bacilli phage families have been shown to use the arbitrium communication system, but the mechanism by which the arbitrium system exerts its function remains largely unknown. Here we study phage {phi}3T, in which arbitrium was originally identified, and find that arbitrium communication controls the phage life-cycle through interactions with a host-encoded defense system. Under lytic conditions, the arbitrium system expresses an anti-toxin, AimX, which blocks the RNA ribonuclease activity of MazF, part of the MazEF toxin-antitoxin system. When arbitrium signal concentration is high, AimX is not expressed and MazF remains active. We find that this activity is necessary for lysogenization. Finally, we show that MazEF acts as a defense system, and protects bacteria against a lytic {phi}3T mutant which lacks AimX and an additional later-expressed MazE-like antitoxin, YosL. Altogether, our results show how a bacterial defense system has been co-opted by phages to control their lysis/lysogeny decision-making.",

    "abstract": "African trypanosomes replicate within infected mammals where they are constantly exposed to the molecules of the complement system. This system centres around complement factor C3, which is present in a soluble form in serum but can become covalently deposited onto the surfaces of pathogens after proteolytic cleavage to C3b. Membrane-associated C3b triggers different complement-mediated effectors which promote pathogen clearance, including complement receptor-mediated stimulation of immune cells or recruitment of components of the pore-forming membrane attack complex. To counter complement-mediated clearance, African trypanosomes have a cell surface receptor, ISG65, which binds to C3b and which decreases the rate of trypanosome clearance in an infection model. However, the mechanism by which ISG65 reduces C3b function had not been determined. We reveal through cryogenic electron microscopy that ISG65 has two distinct binding sites for C3b, only one of which is available in C3, ensuring that ISG65 preferentially binds to active C3b. We show that ISG65 does not block the formation of C3b or the function of the C3 convertase which catalyses the surface deposition of C3b. However, we show that ISG65 forms a specific conjugate with C3b, perhaps acting as a decoy. ISG65 also occludes the binding sites for complement receptors 2 and 3, which will disrupt recruitment of immune cells, including B cells, phagocytes and granulocytes. This suggests that ISG65 protects trypanosomes by combining multiple approaches to dampen the complement cascade.",

In these mice, histological lesions included neuronal degeneration, neuronal vacuolation, perivascular cuffing, leukocyte infiltrates, hemorrhage, and microgliosis, with apoptosis and astrocyte activation detected by immunohistochemistry. Microgliosis and hemorrhage persisted in some surviving mice {approx}3-4 weeks post infection. JEV was universally lethal in IFNAR-/- mice by day 3 with histological signs of brain hemorrhage, but produced no other detectable brain infection or lesions, with NS1 readily detected in blood vessels, but not neurons, by immunohistochemistry. All JEV isolates showed robust productive cytopathic infection of human cortical brain organoids (hBOs), as well as a human neural progenitor cell line (RENcell VM). We thus describe a new IRF7-/-mouse model for JEV, which shows increased penetrance of lethal neuroinvasiveness and recapitulates many aspects human disease. Although less virulent in IRF7-/- mice, JEVNSW/22 retained the capacity to cause lethal encephalitis and to replicate and destroy human neuronal cells.",

    "abstract": "The stomach pathogen Helicobacter pylori utilizes two scaffold proteins, CheW and CheV1, to build critical chemotaxis arrays. Chemotaxis helps bacteria establish and maintain infection. Mutants lacking either of these chemotaxis proteins have different soft agar phenotypes: deletion of cheW creates non-chemotactic strains, while deletion of cheV1 results in 50% loss of chemotaxis. In this work, we characterized the cheV1 deletion mutant phenotype in detail. cheV1 deletion mutants had poor soft-agar migration initially, but regained migration ability over time. This improved bacterial migration was stable, suggesting a genetic suppressor phenotype, termed Che+. Whole-genome sequencing analysis of four distinct cheV1 Che+ strains revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a common gene, HPG27_252 (HP0273). These SNPs were predicted to truncate the encoded protein. To confirm the role of HPG27_252 in the cheV1 phenotype, we created a targeted deletion of HPG27_252 and found that loss of HPG27_252 enhanced soft-agar migration. HPG27_252 and CheV1 appear to interact directly, based on bacterial two-hybrid analysis. HPG27_252 is predicted to encode a 179 amino acid, 21 kDa protein annotated as a hypothetical protein. Computational analysis revealed this protein to be a remote homolog of the PilO Type IV filament membrane alignment complex protein. Although H. pylori is not known to possess Type IV filaments, our analysis showed it retains an operon of genes for homologs of PilO, PilN, and PilM, but does not possess other Type IV pili genes. Our data suggest the PilO homolog plays a role in regulating H. pylori chemotaxis and motility, suggesting new ideas about evolutionary steps for controlling migration through semi-solid media.",

    "abstract": "The 3 untranslated region (3UTR) plays a crucial role in determining mRNA stability, localisation, translation and degradation. Cap analysis gene expression (CAGE), a method for the detection of capped 5 ends of mRNAs, additionally reveals a large number of apparently 5 capped RNAs derived from 3UTRs. Here we provide the first direct evidence that these 3UTR-derived RNAs are indeed capped and often more abundant than the corresponding full-length mRNAs. By using a combination of AGO2 enhanced individual nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (eiCLIP) and CAGE following siRNA knockdowns, we find that these 3UTR-derived RNAs likely originate from AGO2-mediated cleavage, and most often occur at locations with potential to form RNA-G-quadruplexes and are enriched by RNA-binding protein UPF1. High-resolution imaging and long-read sequencing analysis validates several 3UTR-derived RNAs, demonstrates their abundance and shows that they tend not to co-localise with the parental mRNAs. We also find that production of 3UTR-derived RNA could explain the previously reported role of a 3UTR G-quadruplex in regulating the production of APP protein. Taken together, we provide new insights into the origin and abundance of 3UTR-derived RNAs, show the utility of CAGE-seq for their quantitative detection, and provide a rich dataset for exploring new biology of a poorly understood new class of RNAs.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=73 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/538568v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (15K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f2ca7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18ca1b6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ccdd8dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e58938_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Amino-terminal (Nt-) acetylation (NTA) is a common protein modification, affecting approximately 80% of all human proteins. The human essential X-linked gene, NAA10, encodes for the enzyme NAA10, which is the catalytic subunit in the N-terminal acetyltransferase A (NatA) complex, also including the accessory protein, NAA15, encoded by the autosomal gene, NAA15. Although NAA10 is an essential gene in humans, there is nonetheless extensive genetic variation in humans with missense, splice-site, and C-terminal frameshift variants in NAA10. Likewise, the genetic spectrum for NAA15 is also extensive, where the mechanism likely involves haploinsufficiency in heterozygous individuals. The phenotypic presentation in humans with NAA10 or NAA15 variants includes variable levels of intellectual disability, delayed milestones, autism spectrum disorder, craniofacial dysmorphology, cardiac anomalies, seizures, and visual abnormalities. In mice, Naa10 is not an essential gene, as there exists a paralogous gene, Naa12, that substantially rescues Naa10 knockout mice from embryonic lethality, whereas double knockouts (Naa10-/Y Naa12-/-) are embryonic lethal. However, the phenotypic variability in the mice is nonetheless quite extensive, including piebaldism, skeletal defects, small size, hydrocephaly, hydronephrosis, and neonatal lethality. Here we show that the mouse phenotypes are replicated with new genetic alleles, but are modulated by genetic background and environmental effects, as demonstrated by several new mouse strains and backcrossing of the original Naa10 null allele 20 generations to inbred C57BL/6J mice in a different animal facility. We cannot replicate a prior report of \"maternal effect lethality\" for heterozygous Naa10-/X female mice, but we do observe a small amount of embryonic lethality in the Naa10-/y male mice on the inbred genetic background in this different animal facility. We hypothesize that decreased NTA of many different target substrate proteins is the main explanation for the variable phenotypic outcomes, and future experiments will make use of these mice and human cell lines to address this hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Corin is a transmembrane tethered enzyme best known for processing the hormone atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in cardiomyocytes to control electrolyte balance and blood pressure. Loss of function mutations in Corin prevent ANP processing and lead to hypertension. Curiously, Corin loss of function variants also result in lighter coat color pigmentation in multiple species. Corin pigmentation effects are dependent on a functional Agouti locus encoding the agouti-signaling protein (ASIP) based on a genetic interaction. However, the nature of this conserved role of Corin has not been defined. Here we report that ASIP is a direct proteolytic substrate of the Corin enzyme.",
