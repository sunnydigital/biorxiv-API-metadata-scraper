    "abstract": "The medicinal leech, Hirudo verbana, is a powerful model organism for investigating fundamental neurobehavioral processes. The well-documented arrangement and properties of H. verbanas nervous system allows changes at the level of specific neurons or synapses to be linked to physiological and behavioral phenomena. Juxtaposed to the extensive knowledge of H. verbanas nervous system is a limited, but recently expanding, portfolio of molecular and multi-omics tools. Together, the advancement of genetic databases for H. verbana will complement existing pharmacological and electrophysiological data by affording targeted manipulation and analysis of gene expression in neural pathways of interest. Here, we present the first draft genome assembly for H. verbana, which is approximately 250 Mbp in size and consists of 61,282 contigs. Whole genome sequencing was conducted using an Illumina sequencing platform followed by genome assembly with CLC-Bio Genomics Workbench and subsequent functional annotation. Ultimately, the diversity of organisms for which we have genomic information should parallel the availability of next generation sequencing technologies to widen the comparative approach to understand the involvement and discovery of genes in evolutionarily conserved processes. Results of this work hope to facilitate comparative studies with H. verbana and provide the foundation for future, more complete, genome assemblies of the leech.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have yielded transformative clinical success for patients with blood tumors, but their full potential remains to be unleashed against solid tumors. One challenge is finding selective targets: cell surface proteins that are expressed widely by cancer cells and minimally by healthy cells in the tumor microenvironment and other normal tissues.\n\nMETHODS: Analyzing pan-cancer patient tumor single cell transcriptomics data, we first define and quantify selectivity and safety scores of existing CAR targets for indications in which they are in clinical trials or approved. Selectivity scores are computed by the ability of a given surfaceome gene to classify tumor from nontumor cells in the tumor microenvironment. Safety scores are computed by mining healthy tissue transcriptomics and proteomics atlas data. Second, we identify new candidate cell surface CAR targets that have better selectivity and safety scores than the leading targets among those currently being tested, in an indication-specific manner.\n\nRESULTS: Remarkably, in almost all cancer types, we cannot find such better targets, testifying to the overall near optimality of the current target space. However, in HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), for which there is currently a dearth of existing CAR targets, we find five new targets that have both superior selectivity and safety scores. Among the HNSC new targets, we find a few that additionally are strongly essentiality in HNSC cell lines.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian mitochondria, mRNAs are co-transcriptionally stabilized by the protein factor LRPPRC. Here, we characterize LRPPRC as an mRNA delivery factor and report its cryo-EM structure in complex with SLIRP, mRNA and the mitoribosome. The structure shows that LRPPRC associates with the mitoribosomal proteins mS39 and the N-terminus of mS31 through recognition of the LRPPRC helical repeats. Together, the proteins form a corridor for hand-off the mRNA. The mRNA is directly bound to SLIRP, which also has a stabilizing function for LRPPRC. To delineate the effect of LRPPRC on individual mitochondrial transcripts, we used an RNAseq approach, metabolic labeling and mitoribosome profiling that showed a major influence on ND1, ND2, ATP6, COX1, COX2, and COX3 mRNA translation efficiency. Our data suggest that LRPPRC-SLIRP acts in recruitment of mitochondrial mRNAs to modulate their translation. Collectively, the data define LRPPRC-SLIRP as a regulator of the mitochondrial gene expression system.",

    "abstract": "Electrophysiology is a vital tool in neuroscience research with increasing translational value. It is used to record or modulate neuronal activity with high temporal but lower spatial resolution. Optical technologies, such as two-photon microscopy (TPM) can complement electrophysiological recordings with large-scale imaging at cellular resolution. Combining these two provides a powerful platform to elucidate and coordinate multimodal functions. Prior attempts have been limited to the superficial brain from a top-down optical view. Here, we describe a novel combination of transparent microelectrode arrays (MEAs) with glass microprisms for simultaneous electrophysiology and optical imaging of all cortical layers in a vertical plane. We tested our device in Thy1-GCaMP6 mice for over 4 months and demonstrated its capability for multisite single-unit recording, microstimulation, and simultaneous TPM calcium imaging. Using this setup, we reveal how amplitude, frequency, and depth of microstimulation impact neural activation patterns across the cortical column. This work presents a multimodal tool that extends integrated electrophysiology and optical imaging from the superficial brain to the whole cortical column, opening new avenues of neuroscience research and neurotechnology development.",

Most research of SGC function has been performed with in vitro studies, but recent advances in calcium imaging and transgenic mouse models have enabled this first in vivo study of single cell SGC function in mouse models of inflammation and neuropathic pain.\n\nWe found that in naive condition SGCs do not respond in a time-locked fashion to neuronal firing. In painful inflammatory and neuropathic states we detected time-locked signals in a subset of SGCs, but only with suprathreshold stimulation of the sciatic nerve. Surprisingly therefore, we conclude that most calcium signals in SGCs seem to develop at arbitrary intervals not directly linked to neuronal activity patterns.\n\nMore in line with expectations, our experiments also revealed that the number of active SGCs was increased under conditions of inflammation or nerve injury. This could reflect the increased requirement for homeostatic support across dorsal root ganglion neuron populations, which are more active during such painful states.",

    "abstract": "Spike architecture largely affects grain number embraced, which is an important trait to optimize during wheat breeding process. In this study, we incorporated multi-omic data and investigated the genetic regulation of wheat spike development. We generated transcriptome and epigenome profiles of shoot apex at eight developmental stages and observed that chromatin accessibility and H3K27me3 abundance coordinated with transcriptome alteration for flowering transition. A core transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) that drove the formation of the wheat spike was constructed. Integration of the TRN and genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) led to the identification of 227 transcription factors (TFs) with both known (42) and unknown (185) functions. Multi-layer regulatory module among TaSPL6, TaMADS34 and TaMADS15 identified by TRN was validated experimentally. Of the 85 novel TFs with homozygous mutant lines in TILLING library, 38 showed altered spike architecture or flowering time, including bHLH, MYB, and WRKY. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TaMYB4-A regulates fertile spikelet number likely via regulating hormones homeostasis and signaling, and is downstream of, and repressed by WFZP. The elite allele of TaMYB4-A, with a C-SNP at the WFZP binding site, was selected for balancing spikelet number and fertility during breeding process in China. Collectively, our findings provide high-confidence novel regulators and an efficient strategy for studying the genetic basis of wheat spike development for practical breeding applications.",

    "abstract": "A stimulus held in working memory is perceived as contracted towards the average stimulus. This contraction bias has been extensively studied in psychophysics, but little is known about its origin from neural activity. By training recurrent networks of spiking neurons to discriminate temporal intervals, we explored the causes of this bias and how behavior relates to population firing activity. We found that the trained networks exhibited animal-like behavior. Various geometric features of neural trajectories in state space encoded warped representations of the durations of the first interval modulated by sensory history. Formulating a novel normative model, we showed that these representations conveyed a Bayesian estimate of the interval durations, thus relating activity and behavior. Importantly, our findings demonstrate that Bayesian computations already occur during the sensory phase of the first stimulus and persist throughout its maintenance in working memory, until the time of stimulus comparison.",

Considering our extensive visual and motor experience with body postures, we hypothesized that priors derived from this experience may systematically bias visual body posture representations. We examined two priors: gravity and biomechanical constraints. Gravity pushes lifted body parts downwards, while biomechanical constraints limit the range of possible postures (e.g., an arm raised far behind the head cannot go down further). Across three experiments (N = 246) we probed participants memory of briefly presented postures using change discrimination and adjustment tasks. Results showed that lifted arms were misremembered as lower and as more similar to biomechanically plausible postures. Inverting the body stimuli eliminated both biases, implicating holistic body processing. Together, these findings show that knowledge shapes body posture representations, reflecting modulation from a combination of category-general and category-specific priors.",

    "abstract": "During visually guided reaching, proximal limb muscles can be activated within 80 ms of target appearance. Such \"express\" visuomotor responses are temporally aligned with target appearance rather than movement onset, and invariably tuned towards the direction of the visual target regardless of the instructed reach direction. These features prompt the hypothesis that express visuomotor responses are driven by a subcortical pathway. We tested this by measuring the changes in Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) size following Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) or Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (TES) of the motor cortex, as participants reached either towards or away from visual targets. We found that 70-80 ms after target presentation, MEPs in a primary shoulder flexor muscle (pectoralis major) were oriented towards the target direction regardless of whether the participant subsequently reached towards or away from the target. Similar target-oriented MEP modulations occurred in posterior deltoid and biceps brachii muscles, whereas MEPs in a finger muscle were affected neither by target nor reach direction. Critically, there were no significant differences in modulation of responses to TMS versus TES across all reaching conditions, which suggests that the target-oriented modulation occurs downstream of the motor cortex output neurons. Combined, our results are consistent with a subcortical rather than cortical origin for the earliest changes in corticospinal excitability following visual target onset. A prime candidate for such subcortical modulation includes the superior colliculus and reticular formation.",

    "abstract": "High-grade gliomas are aggressive primary brain cancers with poor response to standard regimens, driven by immense heterogeneity. In isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type high-grade glioma (glioblastoma, GBM), increased intra-tumoral heterogeneity is associated with more aggressive disease. Recently, spatial technologies have emerged to dissect this complex heterogeneity within the tumor ecosystem by preserving cellular organization in situ. Here, we construct a high-resolution molecular landscape of GBM and IDH-mutant high-grade glioma patient samples to investigate the cellular subtypes and spatial communities that compose high-grade glioma using digital spatial profiling and spatial molecular imaging. This uncovered striking diversity of the tumor and immune microenvironment, that is embodied by the heterogeneity of the inferred copy-number alterations in the tumor. Reconstructing the tumor architecture revealed two distinct niches, one composed of tumor cell states that most closely resemble normal glial cells, associated with microglia; and the other niche populated by monocytes and mesenchymal tumor cells. We further reveal that communication between tumor and immune cells is underpinned by tumor-specific ligands, such as TGF{beta} signaling in astrocyte-like tumor cells. This primary study reveals high levels of intra-tumoral heterogeneity in high-grade gliomas, associated with a diverse immune landscape within spatially localized regions.",

First, we examined that mzML files with both m/z and intensity encoded in 32-bit precision appear to be a preferred combination via msConvert, which has smaller file size and minor variation with other combinations of storage precision (<0.13%). We then identified that the absolute error of 10-4 for m/z had a feature detection error of 0.57% and compound detection error of 1.1%. For intensities, the relative error group of 2x10-2 had an error of 4.65% for features and 0.98% for compounds, compared with precision-lossless files. Taken together, we provided a reasonable scene-accuracy proposal, with a maximum absolute error of 10-4 for m/z and a maximum relative error of 2x10-2 for intensity.

    "abstract": "While N6-methyldeoxyadenine (6mA) modification has been linked to fundamental regulatory processes in prokaryotes, its prevalence and functional implications in eukaryotes are controversial. Here, we report 6mA-Sniper to quantify 6mA sites in eukaryotes at single-nucleotide resolution. With 6mA-Sniper, we delineated an accurate 6mA profile in C. elegans with 2,034 sites, significantly enriched on sequences of [GC]GAG motif. Twenty-six of 39 6mA events with MnlI restriction endonuclease sites were experimentally verified, demonstrating the feasibility of this method. Notably, the enrichment of these 6mA sites on a specific sequence motif, their within-population conservation and the combinatorial patterns, and the selective constrains on them jointly support an active model for the shaping of the profile by some undiscovered methyltransferases. In a joint study (Cell Research, in revision), Ma et al. reported METL-9 as a new methyltransferase in shaping the basal and stress-dependent 6mA profile in C. elegans. Notably, with the 6mA profile identified by 6mA-Sniper at single-nucleotide resolution, we found that the levels of 6mAs are significantly decreased in strains with the removal of METL-9 (METL-9 KO-OP50), while generally increased after P. aeruginosa infection, further verified the efficiency of 6mA-Sniper in accurately pinpointing 6mA sites. Moreover, for the regions marked by 998 6mA sites emerged specifically after the infection, we identified an enrichment of the upregulated genes after the infection. The gene upregulations are likely mediated through a mutual exclusive crosstalk between 6mA and H3K27me3 modification, as supported by their co-occurrence, and the signal of increased H3K27me3 at regions marked by 6mAs depleted in METL-9 KO-OP50 strains. Notably, in different C. elegans strains, the cross-strain genetic variants removing 6mA sites are associated with the decreased expression of their host genes, and the removal of two randomly-selected 6mA events with genome editing directly decreased the expression of their host genes. We thus highlight 6mA regulation as a previously-neglected regulator of transcriptome in eukaryotes.",

In addition, Arc protein forms capsid-like particles, which can encapsulate and transfer mRNA in extracellular vesicles (EVs) between neurons, that could modulate synaptic function and plasticity. Glioma cell networks actively interact with neurons via paracrine signaling and formation of neurogliomal glutamatergic synapses that contribute to cancer cell survival, proliferation, and invasion. Here, we revealed that Arc is expressed in human glioma cell lines, which can produce EVs containing Arc protein and Arc mRNA (or \"Arc EVs\"). Recombinant Arc protein binds to Arc mRNA with 1.5-fold higher affinity as compared with control mCherry mRNA. Arc EVs from U87 glioma cells internalize and deliver Arc mRNA to recipient U87 cells, where it is translated into a protein. Arc overexpression significantly increases EV production, alters EV morphology, and enhances intercellular transfer of highly expressed mRNA in glioma cell culture. These findings indicate involvement of Arc EVs into mRNA transfer between glioma cells that could contribute to tumor progression and affect synaptic plasticity in cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Interferon-stimulated gene-15 (ISG15) is an interferon-induced protein with two ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domains linked by a short peptide chain, and the conjugated protein of the ISGylation system. Similar to ubiquitin and other Ubls, ISG15 is ligated to its target proteins with a series of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes known as Uba7, Ube2L6/UbcH8, and HERC5, respectively. Ube2L6/UbcH8 plays a literal central role in ISGylation, underscoring it as an important drug target for boosting innate antiviral immunity. Depending on the type of conjugated protein and the ultimate target protein, E2 enzymes have been shown to function as monomers, dimers, or both. UbcH8 has been crystalized in both monomeric and dimeric forms, but the functional state is unclear. Here, we used a combined approach of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to characterize UbcH8s oligomeric state in solution. SAXS revealed a dimeric UbcH8 structure that could be dissociated when fused with an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase molecule. NMR spectroscopy validated the presence of a concentration-dependent monomer-dimer equilibrium and suggested a backside dimerization interface. Chemical shift perturbation and peak intensity analysis further suggest dimer-induced conformational dynamics at ISG15 and E3 interfaces - providing hypotheses for the proteins functional mechanisms. Our study highlights the power of combining NMR and SAXS techniques in providing structural information about proteins in solution.",

    "abstract": "Organisms have evolved a range of constitutive (always active) and inducible (elicited by parasites) defence mechanisms, but we have limited understanding of what drives the evolution of these orthogonal defence strategies. Bacteria and their phages offer a tractable system to study this: bacteria can acquire constitutive resistance by mutation of the phage receptor (surface mutation, sm) or induced resistance through their CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune system. Using a combination of theory and experiments we demonstrate that the mechanism that establishes first has a strong advantage because it weakens selection for the alternative resistance mechanism. As a consequence, ecological factors that alter the relative frequencies at which the different resistances are acquired have a strong and lasting impact: high growth conditions promote the evolution of sm resistance by increasing the influx of receptor mutation events during the early stages of the epidemic, whereas a high infection risk during this stage of the epidemic promotes the evolution of CRISPR immunity, since it fuels the (infection-dependent) acquisition of CRISPR immunity. This work highlights the strong and lasting impact of the transient evolutionary dynamics during the early stages of an epidemic on the long-term evolution of constitutive and induced defences, which may be leveraged to manipulate phage resistance evolution in clinical and applied settings.",

    "abstract": "Successful colonization of a multitude of ecological niches by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa relies on its ability to respond to concentrations of self-produced signal molecules. This intercellular communication system known as quorum sensing (QS) tightly regulates the expression of virulence determinants and a diversity of survival functions, including those required for social behaviours. In planktonic cultures of P. aeruginosa, the transcriptional regulator LasR is generally considered on top of the QS circuitry hierarchy; its activation relies on binding to 3-oxo-C12-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12-HSL), a product of the LasI synthase. Transcription of lasI is activated by LasR, resulting in a positive feedback loop. Few studies have looked at the function of QS during surface growth even though P. aeruginosa typically lives in biofilm-like communities under natural conditions. Here, we show that surface-grown P. aeruginosa readily produces 3-oxo-C12-HSL in absence of LasR, and that this phenotype is frequent upon surface association in naturally occurring environmental and clinical LasR-defective isolates, suggesting a conserved alternative function for the signal. Indeed, even in the absence of the cognate regulator LasR, 3-oxo-C12-HSL upregulates the autologous expression of pyocyanin and of LasR-controlled virulence determinants in neighboring cells. This highlights a possible role for 3-oxo-C12-HSL in shaping community responses and provides a possible evolutive benefit for mixed populations to carry LasR-defective cells, a common feature of natural of P. aeruginosa.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonizes and thrives in many environments, in which it is typically found in surface-associated polymicrobial communities known as biofilms. Adaptation to this social behavior is aided by quorum sensing (QS), an intercellular communication system pivotal in the expression of social traits. Regardless of its importance in QS regulation, the loss of function of the master regulator LasR is now considered a conserved adaptation of P. aeruginosa, irrespective of the origin of strains. By investigating the QS circuitry in surface-grown cells, we found accumulation of QS signal 3-oxo-C12-HSL in absence of its cognate receptor and activator, LasR. The current understanding of the QS circuit, mostly based on planktonic growing cells, is challenged by investigating the QS circuitry of surface-grown cells. This provides a new perspective on the beneficial aspects that underline the frequency of LasR-deficient isolates.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) plays an important role in platelet activation and aggregation and aggravates thrombosis. Chronic stress can cause a variety of diseases, including coagulation disorders, increased thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and a series of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. However, it is still unknown how chronic stress regulates the expression of TSP-1 after glucocorticoid receptor activation.\n\nApproach and Results: rats chronic unpredictable mild stress model was applied and the changes of TSP-1 and microRNAs in plasma were examined. Effects of glucocorticoid receptor activation on human umbilical vein endothelial cells and platelets were observed. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation upregulated the expression of TSP-1 and downregulated the expression of microRNA-1-3p accompanied with increase of phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and argonaute-2 (AGO-2). Blockade of p38 MAPK phosphorylation resulted in decrease of phosphorylation level of AGO-2, increase of microRNA-1-3p expression, and decrease of TSP-1 expression. Transfection of AGO-2 Y393F point mutant plasmid, increased microRNA-1-3p expression and decreased TSP-1 expression, transfection of microRNA-1-3p mimic also decreased TSP-1 expression, while transfection of microRNA-1-3p inhibitor increased TSP-1 expression. Finally, GR activation led to an increase in the phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK in platelets and an increase in the level of TSP-1 in the supernatant.\n\nConclusions: our study demonstrates that GR activation in HUVEC stimulates the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, which in turn promotes the phosphorylation of AGO-2 and inhibits the maturation of microRNA-1-3p, leading to elevated expression of TSP-1, GR activation in platelets leads to the release of TSP-1.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=147 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/536820v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (45K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@86e8ecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@126094eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2d13c3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16c79c3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphical AbstractC_FLOATNO HSS: Hydrocortisone sodium succinate\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "The EBI2 receptor is a major modulator of innate immunity and, together with its ligand, oxysterol 7,25OHC, has been implicated in several neuroinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. 7,25OHC is synthesised from cholesterol with CH25H and CYP7B1 enzymes and degraded with HSD3B7. The concentration of 7,25OHC in the brain increases in the early phases of the murine model of multiple sclerosis, leading to an enhanced central nervous system (CNS) infiltration with EBI2-expressing lymphocytes. Here, we aimed to investigate whether the enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of 7,25OHC are expressed directly in the mouse brain microvascular cells and whether systemic inflammation modulates their levels in these cells. Normal mouse brain capillaries were isolated and immunostained for EBI2, CH25H, CYP7B1 and HSD3B7. Subsequently, mice were challenged with lipopolysaccharide and the mRNA expression in whole brain homogenates was measured. Changes in the receptor and enzyme levels were quantified directly in endothelial cells (ECs), pericytes and astrocytes. The data indicated high levels of EBI2 in the brain microvascular ECs, pericytes and astrocytes with the highest co-localisation in pericytes. CH25H was detected in ECs and astrocytes with low levels in pericytes. CYP7B1 was moderately expressed in ECs, astrocytes and pericytes. The 7,25OHC degrading enzyme HSD3B7 was the least detected in astrocytes. Moreover, the data indicated that systemic inflammation downregulated the mRNA levels of Ebi2 and upregulated Ch25h expression in the whole brain. Specifically in each cell type, EBI2 was not induced in ECs but increased in astrocytes and pericytes. CH25H levels increased in astrocytes and pericytes and CYP7B1 in ECs and astrocytes. The degrading enzyme, HSD3B7, was least affected by systemic inflammation. Taken together, we here demonstrate that EBI2 and the enzymes regulating its ligand levels are differentially expressed in mouse brain microvessels and are highly modulated by systemic inflammation. Upregulated concentration of 7,25OHC in the brain during inflammation may lead to an increased migration of EBI2-expressing immune cells into the CNS during infection or neuroinflammatory disease. Modulation of the EBI2/oxysterol system in the brain or directly in the brain blood vessels may thus provide a new approach to treating neuroinflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis.",

    "abstract": "The superior colliculus (SC) in the mammalian midbrain is essential for multisensory integration, attention, and complex behavior (Basso and May, 2017; Cang et al., 2018). The mature SC cytoarchitecture is organized into distinct laminae and composed of a rich variety of neuronal and glial cell types (Ayupe et al., 2023; Edwards et al., 1986; May, 2006; Xie et al., 2021; Zeisel et al., 2018). Precise execution of the developmental programs regulating the generation of SC cell-type diversity is essential, because deficits due to genetic mutations have been associated with neurodevelopmental diseases and SC dysfunction (Jure, 2018; McFadyen et al., 2020). However, the fundamentals directing the ontogeny of the SC are not well understood. Here we pursued systematic lineage tracing at the single progenitor cell level in order to decipher the principles instructing the generation of cell-type diversity in the SC. We combined in silico lineage reconstruction with a novel genetic MADM (Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers)-CloneSeq approach. MADM-CloneSeq enables the unequivocal delineation of cell lineages in situ, and cell identity based on global transcriptome, of individual clonally-related cells. Our systematic reconstructions of cell lineages revealed that all neuronal cell types in SC emerge from local progenitors without any extrinsic source. Strikingly, individual SC progenitors are exceptionally multipotent with the capacity to produce all known excitatory and inhibitory neuron types of the prospective mature SC, with individual clonal units showing no pre-defined composition. At the molecular level we identified an essential role for PTEN signaling in establishing appropriate proportions of specific inhibitory and excitatory neuron types. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that individual multipotent progenitors generate the full spectrum of excitatory and inhibitory neuron types in the developing SC, providing a novel framework for the emergence of cell-type diversity and thus the ontogeny of the mammalian SC.",

    "abstract": "Recent theoretical work embedded within the predictive processing framework has proposed that the neurocognitive and therapeutic effects of psychedelics are driven by the modulation of priors (Carhart-Harris & Friston, 2019). We conducted pre-registered re-analyses of previous research (Yanakieva et al., 2019) to examine whether microdoses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) alleviate the temporal reproduction bias introduced by priors, as predicted by this theoretical framework. In a between-groups design, participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups receiving LSD (5, 10, or 20 g) or placebo (0 g) and completed a visual temporal reproduction task spanning subsecond to suprasecond intervals (0.8 to 4 sec). Using mixed-effects modelling, we evaluated the impact of the treatment group, and of the overall history of stimulus intervals (global priors) and the local stimulus history (local priors), weighted by their respective precision weights (inverse of variance), on temporal reproduction. Our principal finding was that the precision-weighted local priors and their precision weights reduced the under-reproduction bias observed under LSD in the original research. Furthermore, controlling for the precision- weighted local prior eliminated the reduced temporal reproduction bias under LSD, indicating that LSD microdosing mitigated the temporal under-reproduction by reducing the relative weighting of priors. These results suggest that LSD microdosing alters human time perception by decreasing the influence of local temporal priors.",

    "abstract": "Biophysically detailed simulations attempting to reproduce neuronal activity often rely on solving large systems of differential equations; in some models, these systems have tens of thousands of states per cell. Numerically solving these equations is computationally intensive and requires making assumptions about the initial cell states. Additional realism from incorporating more biological detail is achieved at the cost of increasingly more states, more computational resources, and more modeling assumptions. We show that for both point and morphologically-detailed cell models, the presence and timing of future action potentials is probabilistically well-characterized by the relative timings of a small number of recent synaptic events alone. Knowledge of initial conditions or full synaptic input history is not a requirement. While model time constants, etc. impact the specifics, we demonstrate that for both individual spikes and sustained cellular activity, the uncertainty in spike response decreases to the point of approximate determinism. Further, we show cellular model states are reconstructable from ongoing synaptic events, despite unknown initial conditions. We propose that a strictly event-based modeling framework is capable of representing the full complexity of cellular dynamics of the differential-equations models with significantly less per-cell state variables, thus offering a pathway toward utilizing modern data-driven modeling to scale up to larger network models while preserving individual cellular biophysics.",

    "abstract": "Peptide therapeutics are robust and promising molecules for treating diverse disease conditions. These molecules can be developed from naturally occurring or mimicking native peptides, through rational design and peptide libraries. We developed a new platform for the rapid screening of the peptide therapeutics for disease targets. In the course of the study, we aimed to employ our platform to screen a new generation of peptide therapeutics candidates against aggregation prone protein targets. Two peptide drug candidates for the protein aggregation prone diseases namely Parkinsons and Alzheimers diseases were screened. Currently, there are several therapeutic applications that are only effective in masking or slowing down symptom development. Nonetheless, different approaches are developed for inhibiting amyloid aggregation in the secondary nucleation phase, which is critical for amyloid fibril formation. Instead of targeting secondary nucleated protein structures, we tried to inhibit monomeric amyloid units as a novel approach for halting disease-condition. To achieve this, we combined yeast surface display and phage display library platforms. We expressed -synuclein, amyloid {beta}40, and amyloid {beta}42 on yeast surface, and we selected peptides by using phage display library. After iterative biopanning cycles optimized for yeast cells, several peptides were selected for interaction studies. All of the peptides have been used in vitro characterization methods which are QCM-D measurement, AFM imaging, and ThT assay, and they have yielded promising results in order to block fibrillization or interact with amyloid units as a sensor molecule candidate. Therefore, peptides are good choice for diverse disease-prone molecule inhibition particularly those inhibiting fibrillization. Additionally, these selected peptides can be used as drugs and sensors to detect disease quickly and halt disease progression.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=77 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/536742v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (18K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@50c81dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@181fea5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17539c7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1244a00_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Extensively shared gene expression suggests that conserved molecular mechanisms are involved in their development, but a few transcription factor genes are restricted either to the developing electrosensory or mechanosensory lateral line. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in F0-injected sterlet embryos (Acipenser ruthenus, a sturgeon) to test the function of three such genes. We found that the  hair cell transcription factor gene Atoh1 is required for both hair cell and electroreceptor differentiation in sterlet, and for Pou4f3 and Gfi1 expression in both neuromasts and ampullary organs. These data support the conservation of developmental mechanisms between hair cells and electroreceptors. Targeting ampullary organ-restricted Neurod4 did not yield any phenotype, potentially owing to redundancy with other Neurod genes that we found to be expressed in sterlet ampullary organs. After targeting mechanosensory-restricted Foxg1, ampullary organs formed within neuromast lines, suggesting that Foxg1 normally represses their development. We speculate that electrosensory organs may be the  default fate of lateral line primordia in electroreceptive vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "The nephron, functional unit of the vertebrate kidney, is specialized in metabolic wastes excretion and body fluids osmoregulation. Given the high evolutionary conservation of gene expression and segmentation patterning between mammalian and amphibian nephrons, the Xenopus laevis pronephric kidney offers a simplified model for studying nephrogenesis. The Lhx1 transcription factor plays several roles during embryogenesis, regulating target genes expression by forming multiprotein complexes with LIM binding protein 1 (Ldb1). However, few Lhx1-Ldb1 cofactors have been identified for kidney organogenesis. By tandem-affinity purification from kidney-induced Xenopus animal caps, we identified single-stranded DNA binding protein 2 (Ssbp2) interacts with the Ldb1-Lhx1 complex. Ssbp2 is expressed in the Xenopus pronephros, and knockdown prevents normal morphogenesis and differentiation of the glomus and the convoluted renal tubules. We demonstrate a role for a member of the Ssbp family in kidney organogenesis and provide evidence of a fundamental function for the Ldb1-Lhx1-Ssbp transcriptional complexes in embryonic development.",

    "abstract": "Periodic patterning requires coordinated cell-cell interactions at the tissue level. Turing showed, using mathematical modeling, how spatial patterns could arise from the reactions of a diffusive activator-inhibitor pair in an initially homogenous two-dimensional field. Most activators and inhibitors studied in biological systems are proteins, and the roles of cell-cell interaction, ions, bioelectricity, etc. are only now being identified. Gap junctions (GJs) mediate direct exchanges of ions or small molecules between cells, enabling rapid long-distance communications in a cell collective. They are therefore good candidates for propagating non-protein-based patterning signals that may act according to the Turing principles. Here, we explore the possible roles of GJs in Turing-type patterning using feather pattern formation as a model. We found seven of the twelve investigated GJ isoforms are highly dynamically expressed in the developing chicken skin. In ovo functional perturbations of the GJ isoform, connexin 30, by siRNA and the dominant-negative mutant applied before placode development led to disrupted primary feather bud formation, including patches of smooth skin and buds of irregular sizes. Later, after the primary feather arrays were laid out, inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication in the ex vivo skin explant culture allowed the emergence of new feather buds in temporal waves at specific spatial locations relative to the existing primary buds. The results suggest that gap junctional communication may facilitate the propagation of long-distance inhibitory signals. Thus, the removal of GJ activity would enable the emergence of new feather buds if the local environment is competent and the threshold to form buds is reached. We propose Turing-based computational simulations that can predict the appearance of these ectopic bud waves. Our models demonstrate how a Turing activator-inhibitor system can continue to generate patterns in the competent morphogenetic field when the level of intercellular communication at the tissue scale is modulated.",

    "abstract": "Central noradrenergic (NA) neurons are key constituents of the respiratory homeostatic network. NA dysfunction is implicated in several developmental respiratory disorders including Central Congenital Hyperventilation Syndrome (CCHS), Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and Rett Syndrome. The current unchallenged paradigm in the field, supported by multiple studies, is that glutamate co-transmission in subsets of central NA neurons plays a role in breathing control. If true, NA-glutamate co-transmission may also be mechanistically important in respiratory disorders. However, the requirement of NA derived glutamate in breathing has not been directly tested and the extent of glutamate co-transmission in the central NA system remains uncharacterized. Therefore, we fully characterized the cumulative fate maps and acute adult expression patterns of all three Vesicular Glutamate Transporters (Slc17a7 (Vglut1), Slc17a6 (Vglut2), and Slc17a8 (Vglut3)) in NA neurons, identifying a novel dynamic expression pattern for Vglut2 and an undescribed co-expression domain for Vglut3 in the NA system. Our functional studies showed that loss of Vglut2 throughout the NA system failed to alter breathing or metabolism under room air, hypercapnia, or hypoxia in unrestrained and conscious mice, which demonstrates that Vglut2-based glutamatergic signaling within the central NA system is not required for normal baseline breathing and hypercapnic, hypoxic chemosensory reflexes. These outcomes challenge the current understanding of central NA neurons in the control of breathing and suggests that glutamate may be not a critical target to understand NA neuron dysfunction in respiratory diseases.",

Here, using fMRI-measured brain responses to 1,000 diverse sentences, we develop a GPT-based encoding model and use this model to identify new sentences that are predicted to drive or suppress responses in the human language network. We demonstrate that these model-selected novel sentences indeed drive and suppress activity of human language areas in new individuals (86% increase and 98% decrease relative to the average response to diverse naturalistic sentences). A systematic analysis of the model-selected sentences reveals that surprisal and well-formedness of linguistic input are key determinants of response strength in the language network.

    "abstract": "Human language offers a variety of ways to create meaning, one of which is referring to entities, objects, or events in the world. One such meaning maker is understanding to whom or to what a pronoun in a discourse refers to. To understand a pronoun, the brain must access matching entities or concepts that have been encoded in memory from previous linguistic context. Models of language processing propose that internally stored linguistic concepts, accessed via exogenous cues such as phonological input of a word, are represented as (a)synchronous activities across a population of neurons active at specific frequency bands. Converging evidence suggests that delta band activity (1-3Hz) is involved in temporal and representational integration during sentence processing. Moreover, recent advances in the neurobiology of memory suggest that recollection engages reinstatement of neural dynamics that occurred during memory encoding. Integrating from these two research lines, we here predicted that neural dynamic patterns, especially in delta frequency range, underlying referential meaning representation would be reinstated during pronoun resolution. By leveraging neural decoding techniques (i.e., representation similarity analysis) on a magnetoencephalogram (MEG) dataset acquired during a naturalistic story-listening task, we provide evidence that delta-band activity underlies referential meaning representation. Our findings suggest that, during spoken language comprehension, endogenous linguistic representations such as referential concepts may be retrieved and represented via reinstatement of dynamic neural patterns.",

The origin of these affect-specific visual representations is debated: they are innate to the visual system versus they arise through reentry from frontal emotion processing structures such as the amygdala. We examined this problem by combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) model of the human ventral visual cortex pre-trained on ImageNet with two datasets of affective images. Our results show that (1) in all layers of the CNN model, there were artificial neurons that responded consistently and selectively to neutral, pleasant, or unpleasant images and (2) lesioning these neurons by setting their output to 0 or enhancing these neurons by increasing their gain lead to decreased or increased emotion recognition performance respectively. These results support the idea that the visual system may have the innate ability to represent the affective significance of visual input and suggest that CNNs offer a fruitful platform for testing neuroscientific theories.\n\nTeaserA convolutional neural network (CNN) model of the human ventral visual cortex shows that artificial neurons respond selectively to emotional images, supporting the idea of an innate ability to represent affective significance of visual input.",

    "abstract": "Cancer therapy research is of high interest because of the persistence and mortality of the disease and the side effects of traditional therapeutic methods, while often multimodal treatments are necessary based on the patients needs. The development of less invasive modalities for recurring treatment cycles is thus of critical significance. Herein, a light-activatable microparticle system was developed for localized, pulsatile delivery of anticancer drugs with simultaneous thermal ablation, by applying controlled ON-OFF thermal cycles using near-infrared laser irradiation. The system is composed of poly(caprolactone) microparticles of 200 m size with incorporated molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets as the photothermal agent and hydrophilic doxorubicin or hydrophobic violacein, as model drugs. Upon irradiation the nanosheets heat up to [&ge;]50 {degrees}C leading to polymer matrix melting and release of the drug. MoS2 nanosheets exhibit high photothermal conversion efficiency and allow for application of low power laser irradiation for the system activation. A Machine Learning algorithm was applied to acquire optimal laser operation conditions; 0.4 W/cm2 laser power at 808 nm, 3-cycle irradiation, for 3 cumulative minutes. In a mouse subcutaneous model of 4T1 triple-negative breast cancer, 25 microparticles were intratumorally administered and after 3-cycle laser treatment the system conferred synergistic phototherapeutic and chemotherapeutic effect. Our on-demand, pulsatile synergistic treatment resulted in increased median survival up to 40 days post start of treatment compared to untreated mice, with complete eradication of the tumors at the primary site. Such a system could have potential for patients in need of recurring cycles of treatment on subcutaneous tumors.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=56 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/536750v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (11K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14ab0f3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a72649org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c28608org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ed9c06_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Large-scale sequencing efforts of thousands of tumor samples have been undertaken to understand the mutational landscape of the coding genome. However, the vast majority of germline and somatic variants occur within non-coding portions of the genome. These genomic regions do not directly encode for specific proteins, but can play key roles in cancer progression, for example by driving aberrant gene expression control. Here, we designed an integrative computational and experimental framework to identify recurrently mutated non-coding regulatory regions that drive tumor progression. Application of this approach to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from a large cohort of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) revealed a large set of recurrently mutated regions. We used (i) in silico prioritization of functional non-coding mutations, (ii) massively parallel reporter assays, and (iii) in vivo CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) screens in xenografted mice to systematically identify and validate driver regulatory regions that drive mCRPC. We discovered that one of these enhancer regions, GH22I030351, acts on a bidirectional promoter to simultaneously modulate expression of U2-associated splicing factor SF3A1 and chromosomal protein CCDC157. We found that both SF3A1 and CCDC157 are promoters of tumor growth in xenograft models of prostate cancer. We nominated a number of transcription factors, including SOX6, to be responsible for higher expression of SF3A1 and CCDC157. Collectively, we have established and confirmed an integrative computational and experimental approach that enables the systematic detection of non-coding regulatory regions that drive the progression of human cancers.",

To define mechanisms involved, we treat established desmoplastic pancreatic tumors with CAR T cells directed to fibroblast activation protein (FAP), an enzyme highly overexpressed on a subset of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Depletion of FAP+CAFs results in loss of the structural integrity of desmoplastic matrix. This renders these highly treatment-resistant cancers susceptible to subsequent treatment with a tumor antigen (mesothelin)-targeted CAR and to anti-PD1 antibody therapy. Mechanisms include overcoming stroma-dependent restriction of T cell extravasation and/or perivascular invasion, reversing immune exclusion, relieving T cell suppression, and altering the immune landscape by reducing myeloid cell accumulation and increasing endogenous CD8+ T cell and NK cell infiltration. These data provide strong rationale for combining tumor stroma-and malignant cell-targeted therapies to be tested in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Sensitivity analysis is often used to help understand and manage ecological systems, by assessing how a constant change in vital rates or other model parameters might affect the management outcome. This allows the manager to identify the most favorable course of action. However, realistic changes are often localized in time--for example, a short period of culling leads to a temporary increase in the mortality rate over the period. Hence, knowing when to act may be just as important as knowing what to act upon. In this article, we introduce the method of time-dependent sensitivity analysis (TDSA) that simultaneously addresses both questions. We illustrate TDSA using three case studies: transient dynamics in static disease transmission networks, disease dynamics in a reservoir species with seasonal life-history events, and endogenously-driven population cycles in herbivorous invertebrate forest pests. We demonstrate how TDSA often provides useful biological insights, which are understandable on hindsight but would not have been easily discovered without the help of TDSA. However, as a caution, we also show how TDSA can produce results that mainly reflect uncertain modeling choices and are therefore potentially misleading. We provide guidelines to help users maximize the utility of TDSA while avoiding pitfalls.",

Thus it represents an excellent model to study the diversification of Neotropical biota. Herein, by generating a time-calibrated species-level phylogeny, we investigate the origin and historical biogeography of Dipsadidae and test if its two main Neotropical subfamilies, Xenodontinae and Dipsadinae, have different geographical origins.\n\nLocationNeotropical region.\n\nTaxonDipsadidae (Serpentes).\n\nMethodsWe generated a new Bayesian time-calibrated phylogeny including sequences from six genes for 344 species, including 287 species of Dipsadidae. We subsequently estimated ancestral areas of distribution by comparing models in BioGeoBEARS: DEC (subset sympatry, narrow vicariance), DIVALIKE (narrow and wide vicariance), BAYAREALIKE (no vicariance and widespread sympatry), also testing jump dispersal.\n\nResultsThe best models show that Dipsadidae likely originated approximately 50 million years ago (mya) in Asia. Dispersal was a fundamental process in its historical biogeography. The DEC model with jump dispersal indicated that this family underwent a range extension from Asia and posterior vicariance of North and Central America ancestors. Both Xenodontinae and Dipsadinae originated in Central America and dispersed to South America during Middle Eocene, but did so to different regions (cis and trans-Andean South America, respectively). Xenodontinae entered cis-Andean South America around 39 mya and jump dispersed to the West Indies around 33 mya, while Dipsadinae entered trans-Andean South America multiple times 20 - 38 mya.\n\nMain conclusionsOur results show that Dipsadidae has an Asian origin and that the two main Neotropical subfamilies originated in Central America, later dispersing to South America in different time periods. The current biogeographical patterns of the family Dipsadidae, the most species-rich snake family in the world, have likely been shaped by complex evolutionary and geological processes such as Eocene land bridges, Andean uplift and the formation of the Panama isthmus.",

    "abstract": "The biomechanics of peripheral nerves are determined by the blood-nerve barrier (BNB), together with the epineural barrier, extracellular matrix, and axonal composition, which maintain structural and functional stability. These elements are often ignored in the fabrication of penetrating devices, and the implant process is traumatic due to the mechanical distress, compromising the function of neuroprosthesis for sensory-motor restoration in amputees. Miniaturization of penetrating interfaces offers the unique opportunity of decoding individual nerve fibers associated to specific functions, however, a main issue for their implant is the lack of high-precision standardization of insertion forces. Current automatized electromechanical force sensors are available; however, their sensitivity and range amplitude are limited (i.e. mN), and have been tested only in-vitro. We previously developed a high-precision bi-directional micro-electromechanical force sensor, with a closed-loop mechanism (MEMS-CLFS), that while measuring with high-precision (-211.7N to 211.5N with a resolution of 4.74nN), can be used in alive animal. Our technology has an on-chip electrothermal displacement sensor with a shuttle beam displacement amplification mechanism, for large range and high-frequency resolution (dynamic range of 92.9 dB), which eliminates the adverse effect of flexural nonlinearity measurements, observed with other systems, and reduces the mechanical impact on delicate biological tissue. In this work, we use the MEMS-CLFS for in-vivo bidirectional measurement of biomechanics in somatic and autonomic nerves. Furthermore we define the mechanical implications of irrigation and collagen VI in the BNB, which is different for both autonomic and somatic nerves ([~] 8.5-8.6 fold density of collagen VI and vasculature CD31+ in the VN vs ScN). This study allowed us to create a mathematical approach to predict insertion forces. Our data highlights the necessity of nerve-customization forces to prevent injury when implanting interfaces, and describes a high precision MEMS technology and mathematical model for their measurements.",

    "abstract": "Human experts are good at summarizing explicit strong patterns from small samples, while deep learning models can learn implicit weak patterns from big data. Biologists have traditionally described the sequence patterns of promoters via transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), while the flanking sequences among TFBSs, which can also significantly influence promoter activity and function, remain largely uncharacterized. Thus, current synthetic promoters are mainly designed by the manipulation of TFBSs, while the flanking sequence is often chosen arbitrarily or by previous experience due to a lack of well-summarized optimization criteria. Here, we introduced an AI-aided promoter design framework, DeepSEED, that employs expert knowledge and deep learning methods to efficiently design synthetic promoters that have various desirable functions. DeepSEED incorporates the user-defined cis-regulatory sequences as  seeds and generates flanking sequences that match the  seeds. We showed that DeepSEED can automatically capture k-mer frequencies and DNA shape features from active promoters in the training set and efficiently optimize the flanking sequences to better match desired properties in synthetic promoters. We validated the effectiveness of this framework for diverse synthetic promoter design tasks in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. DeepSEED successfully designed E. coli constitutive, isopropyl-beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible, and mammalian cell doxycycline (Dox)-inducible promoters with significant performance improvements, suggesting that DeepSEED has potential as an efficient AI-aided flanking sequence optimization approach for promoter design that may be of great benefit in synthetic biology applications.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/WangLabTHU/deepseed",

The embedding should encapsulate both the high-level semantics and low-level variations in order to be meaningful and interpretable.

Here, we introduce scVAEDer, a scalable deep-learning model that combines the power of variational autoencoders and deep diffusion models to learn a meaningful representation which can capture both global semantics and local variations in the data. By using the learned embedding, we show that scVAEDer can generate novel scRNA-seq data, predict the effect of the perturbation on various cell types, identify changes in gene expression during dedifferentiation, and detect master regulators in a biological process.",

    "abstract": "Communication between cells located in different parts of an organism is often mediated by membrane-enveloped nanoparticles, such as extracellular vesicles (EVs). EV binding and cell uptake mechanisms depend on the heterogeneous composition of the EV membrane. From a colloidal perspective, the EV membrane interacts with other biological interfaces via both specific and non-specific interactions, where the latter include long-ranged electrostatic and van der Waals forces, and short-ranged repulsive \"steric-hydration\" forces. While electrostatic forces are generally exploited in most EV immobilization protocols, the roles played by various colloidal forces in controlling EV adsorption on surfaces have not yet been thoroughly addressed. In the present work, we study the interaction and adsorption of EVs with supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) carrying different surface charge densities. By probing the EV-SLB interaction using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), we demonstrate that EV adsorption onto lipid membranes can be controlled by varying the strength of electrostatic forces. We then model the observed phenomena within the framework of nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann theory. Modelling results confirm the experimental observations and highlight the crucial role played by attractive electrostatics in EV adsorption onto lipid membranes. Our results provide new fundamental insights into EV-membrane interactions and could be useful for developing novel EV separation and immobilization strategies.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) protein expression/deposition within and stiffening of the breast cancer microenvironment facilitates disease progression and correlates with poor patient survival. However, the mechanisms by which ECM components control tumorigenic behaviors and responses to therapeutic intervention remain poorly understood. Fibronectin (FN) is a major ECM protein controlling multiple processes. In this regard, we previously reported that DHPS-dependent hypusination of eIF5A1/2 is necessary for fibronectin-mediated breast cancer metastasis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we explored the clinical significance of an interactome generated using hypusination pathway components and markers of intratumoral heterogeneity. Solute carrier 3A2 (SLC3A2 or CD98hc) stood out as an indicator of poor overall survival among patients with basal-like breast cancers that express elevated levels of DHPS. We subsequently discovered that blockade of DHPS or SLC3A2 reduced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) spheroid growth. Interestingly, spheroids stimulated with exogenous fibronectin were less sensitive to inhibition of either DHPS or SLC3A2 - an effect that could be abrogated by dual DHPS/SLC3A2 blockade. We further discovered that a subset of TNBC cells responded to fibronectin by increasing cytoplasmic localization of eIF5A1/2. Notably, these fibronectin-induced subcellular localization phenotypes correlated with a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Fibronectin-treated TNBC cells responded to dual DHPS/SLC3A2 blockade by shifting eIF5A1/2 localization back to a nucleus-dominant state, suppressing proliferation and further arresting cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Finally, we observed that dual DHPS/SLC3A2 inhibition increased the sensitivity of both Rb-negative and -positive TNBC cells to the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib. Taken together, these data identify a previously unrecognized mechanism through which extracellular fibronectin controls cancer cell tumorigenicity by modulating subcellular eIF5A1/2 localization and provides prognostic/therapeutic utility for targeting the cooperative DHPS/SLC3A2 signaling axis to improve breast cancer treatment responses.",

However, prediction of expression of individual genes from whole slide images (WSIs) is challenging due to co-dependent or correlated expression of multiple genes. Here, we use a purely data-driven approach to first identify groups of genes with co-dependent expression and then predict their status from (WSIs) using a bespoke graph neural network. These gene groups allow us to capture the gene expression state of a patient with a small number of binary variables that are biologically meaningful and carry histopathological insights for clinically and therapeutic use cases. Prediction of gene expression state based on these gene groups allows associating histological phenotypes (cellular composition, mitotic counts, grading, etc.) with underlying gene expression patterns and opens avenues for gaining significant biological insights from routine pathology imaging directly.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=139 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/536756v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (57K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@74d0dcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13c2708org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@26a6dborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@194b076_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIData-driven discovery of co-expressing gene groups in breast caner\nC_LIO_LIHistological imaging based prediction of gene groups via deep learning\nC_LIO_LIIdentification of phenotypic correlates of gene-expression in histological imaging\nC_LIO_LIClinical and therapeutic impact of gene groups and their visual patterns identified\nC_LI",

For example, highly acidic carbonated beverages sometimes accompany salty snacks, and margaritas made with acidic citrus are served in salt-rimmed glasses. However, whether and how acid might enhance salt taste remain unknown. Epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) in tongue taste cells detect dietary sodium. We found that acid irreversibly increased ENaC channel activity, with half-maximal activation occurring at pH 2.6. Acid altered ENaC gating by increasing the rate of channel opening and reducing the rate of channel closing. Acidic beverages Coca-Cola(R) and Pepsi(R) (pH 2.2-2.4) also stimulated ENaC current but Diet Coke(R) (pH 3.2) did not. In humans, we found that acid reduced the sodium taste detection threshold.

In this study, we sought to understand the ecology of the propagation of Mytilus trossulus Bivalve Transmissible Neoplasia 2 (MtrBTN2), a transmissible cancer affecting four Mytilus mussel species worldwide. We investigated the prevalence of MtrBTN2 in the mosaic hybrid zone of M. edulis and M. galloprovincialis along the French Atlantic coast, sampling contrasting natural and anthropogenic habitats. We observed a similar prevalence in both species, likely due to the proximity of the two species in this region. Our results showed that ports had higher prevalence of MtrBTN2, with a hotspot observed at a shuttle landing dock. No cancer was found in natural beds except for two sites around the hotspot, suggesting spillover. Ports may provide favourable conditions for the transmission of MtrBTN2, such as high mussel density, confined sheltered shores, or buffered temperatures. Ships may also spread the disease through biofouling, with maritime traffic being the best predictor of MtrBTN2 prevalence. Our results suggest ports may serve as epidemiological hubs, with maritime routes providing artificial gateways for MtrBTN2 propagation. This highlights the importance of preventing biofouling on docks and ships hulls to limit the spread of marine pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Masting, the synchronized production of variable quantities of seeds, occurs in many grazed systems and can be interspersed with years of extreme crop failure, whose frequency and unpredictability are increasing with climate change. Yet, the combined impact of crop failure and grazing on seed dispersal and seed-to-seedling transition remains poorly understood. To address this concern, we investigated rodent-mediated cork-oak (Quercus suber) acorn predation, dispersal, and seedling emergence in cattle grazed and non-grazed areas in central Portugal during years with contrasting masting seasons. We found that extreme crop failure led to six times longer and faster acorn dispersal, with 83% more dispersal events than during a year of reproductive success. The percentage of predated acorns also increased by 84%. However, the higher acorn predation was offset by a 2.4-fold higher percentage of unpredated dispersed acorns recruiting into seedlings. Both years ended up recruiting a similar number of seedlings. Acorns emerged seedlings 3.4 times farther in the crop failure year than in the crop success year. Cattle grazing was the main constraint on seed dispersal distance, reducing it by 51% during the extreme crop failure year, while having no noticeable effect during the successful crop year. Our study provides empirical evidence that cattle grazing modulates how an extreme crop failure year can surprisingly be an opportunity for trees remaining fecund to have seedlings established farther apart than in a crop success year. If we are to better manage and preserve the high conservation and socio-economic value of Mediterranean cork oak woodlands in the face of climate change, we must prioritize fecund trees and carefully manage seed dispersal factors such as cattle grazing, particularly during years of crop failure.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages and bacteria are engaged in a constant arms race, continually evolving new molecular tools to survive one another. To protect their genomic DNA from restriction enzymes, the most common bacterial defence systems, double-stranded DNA phages have evolved complex modifications that affect all four bases. This study focuses on modifications at position 7 of guanines. Eight derivatives of 7-deazaguanines were identified, including four previously unknown ones: 2-deoxy-7-(methylamino)methyl-7-deazaguanine (mdPreQ1), 2-deoxy-7-(formylamino)methyl-7-deazaguanine (fdPreQ1), 2-deoxy-7-deazaguanine (dDG), and 2-deoxy-7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine (dCDG). These modifications are inserted in DNA by a guanine transglycosylase named DpdA. Three subfamilies of DpdA had been previously characterized: bDpdA, DpdA1, and DpdA2. Two additional subfamilies were identified in this work: DpdA3, which allows for complete replacement of the guanines, and DpdA4, which is specific to archaeal viruses. Transglycosylases have now been identified in all phages and viruses carrying 7-deazaguanine modifications, indicating that the insertion of these modifications is a post-replication event. Three enzymes were predicted to be involved in the biosynthesis of these newly identified DNA modifications: 7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine decarboxylase (DpdL), dPreQ1 formyltransferase (DpdN), and dPreQ1 methyltransferase (DpdM), which was experimentally validated and harbors a unique fold not previously observed for nucleic acid methylases.",

Most GEFIs are engineered through trial-and-error mutagenesis, which is time and resource-intensive and often relies on empirical knowledge for each GEFI. We applied an alternative approach using machine learning to efficiently predict the outcomes of sensor mutagenesis by analyzing established libraries that link sensor sequences to functions. Using the GCaMP calcium indicator as a scaffold, we developed an ensemble of three regression models trained on experimentally derived GCaMP mutation libraries. We used the trained ensemble to perform an in silico functional screen on a library of 1423 novel, untested GCaMP variants. The mutations were predicted to significantly alter the fluorescent response, and off-rate kinetics were advanced for verification in vitro. We found that the ensembles predictions of novel variants biophysical characteristics closely replicated what we observed of the variants in vitro. As a result, we identified the novel ensemble-derived GCaMP (eGCaMP) variants, eGCaMP and eGCaMP+, that achieve both faster kinetics and larger fluorescent responses upon stimulation than previously published fast variants. Furthermore, we identified a combinatorial mutation with extraordinary dynamic range, eGCaMP2+, that outperforms the tested 6th, 7th, and 8th generation GCaMPs. These findings demonstrate the value of machine learning as a tool to facilitate the efficient prescreening of mutants for functional characteristics. By leveraging the learning capabilities of our ensemble, we were able to accelerate the identification of promising mutations and reduce the experimental burden associated with screening an entire library. Machine learning tools such as this have the potential to complement emerging high-throughput screening methodologies that generate massive datasets, which can be tedious to analyze manually. Overall, these findings have significant implications for developing new GEFIs and other protein-based tools, demonstrating the power of machine learning as an asset in protein engineering.",

    "abstract": "The early nodulin 93 (ENOD93) gene family in plants can regulate biological nitrogen fixation in legumes and nitrogen use efficiency in cereals but its molecular function is unknown. We show profile hidden Markov models define ENOD93 as a distant homolog of the N-terminal domain of RESPIRATORY SUPERCOMPLEX FACTOR 2 (RCF2). RCF2 is reported to regulate cytochrome oxidase (CIV) influencing the generation of a mitochondria proton motive force in yeast. Knockout of enod93 in Arabidopsis leads to a short root phenotype. ENOD93 is associated with a protein complex the size of CIV in isolated mitochondria but neither CIV abundance nor its activity in ruptured organelles changed in enod93. However, a progressive loss of ADP-dependent respiration rate was observed in enod93 mitochondria which could be fully recovered in complemented lines. Mitochondrial membrane potential was higher in enod93 but ATP synthesis and ADP depletion rates progressively decreased. Respiration rate of whole enod93 seedlings was elevated and root ADP content was nearly double that in WT without a change in ATP content. These altered energetic states correlated with elevated respiratory substrate levels in roots of enod93 compared to WT and complemented lines. Overexpression of ENOD93 lowered ATP content in roots and increased the abundance of a range of amino acids in both roots and leaves. We propose that two previously unconnected gene families in plants, ENOD93 and HYPOXIA INDUCED GENE DOMAIN, are the functional equivalent of yeast RCF2 but have remained undiscovered in many eukaryotic lineages because they are encoded in two separate genes.\n\nHighlight significanceWe identify the enigmatic early nodulin ENOD93 gene family as the plant homolog of the N-terminal regulatory domain of the yeast RESPIRATORY SUPERCOMPLEX 2 (RCF2) of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system and provide biochemical and physiological evidence of its role in plant ATP production, broadly explaining the role of ENOD93 in plants.",

Their clinical presentations differ; however, individuals with NDDs are more likely to acquire cancer. Schizophrenia patients have [~]50% increased risk; autistic individuals also face an increased cancer likelihood. NDDs are associated with specific brain cell types at specific locations, emerging at certain developmental time windows during brain evolution. Their related mutations are germline; cancer mutations are sporadic, emerging during life. At the same time, NDDs and cancer share proteins, pathways, and mutations. Here we ask exactly which features they share, and how despite their commonality, they differ in outcomes. Our pioneering bioinformatics exploration of the mutations, reconstructed disease-specific networks, pathways, and transcriptome profiles of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and cancers, points to elevated signal strength in pathways related to proliferation in cancer, and differentiation in ASD. Signaling strength, not the activating mutation, is the key factor in deciding cancer versus NDDs.",

    "abstract": "Safely and efficiently controlling gene expression is a long-standing goal of biomedical research, and the recently discovered bacterial CRISPR/Cas system can be harnessed to create powerful tools for epigenetic editing. Current state-of-the-art systems consist of a deactivated-Cas9 nuclease (dCas9) fused to epigenetic effector motifs/domains, along with a guide RNA (gRNA) which defines the genomic target. Such systems have been used to safely and effectively silence or activate a specific gene target under a variety of circumstances. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are the therapeutic platform of choice for delivery of genetic cargoes; nevertheless, their small packaging capacity is not suitable for the delivery of large constructs, including most CRISPR/dCas9-effector systems. To circumvent this, many AAV-based CRISPR/Cas tools are delivered separately from two viral cassettes. However, this approach requires higher viral payloads and usually is less efficient. Here we develop a compact dCas9-based repressor system packaged within a single, optimized AAV vector. The system uses a smaller dCas9 variant derived from Staphylococcus aureus (Sa). A novel repressor was engineered by fusing the small transcription repression domain (TRD) from MeCP2 with the KRAB repression domain. The final dSaCas9-KRAB-MeCP2(TRD) construct can be efficiently packaged, along with its associated gRNA, into AAV particles. Using reporter assays, we demonstrate that the platform is capable of robustly and sustainably repressing the expression of multiple genes-of-interest, both in vitro and in vivo. Most relevantly, we successfully silenced APOE, the primary genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD). This new platform will broaden the CRISPR/dCas9 toolset available for transcriptional manipulation of gene expression in research and therapeutic settings.",

In this work, we describe the  instant ELISA biosensor platform, a probe that can be exposed directly to blood or other biological samples and quantifies protein biomarkers within 15 minutes. The sensor leverages a novel affinity reagent termed  monolithic dual-antibody clamp (MDAC) which preserves the specificity, sensitivity, and generalizability of ELISA while also enabling rapid analysis of unprocessed blood and other complex matrices. Using MDAC in chicken media, we demonstrate picomolar quantification of the inflammatory marker tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), as well as monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, a useful prognostic indicator of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) during chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapy.

AXL receptor tyrosine kinase is a biomarker and therapeutic target for a variety of metastatic cancers while tumorigenesis and placentation share many features. In this study, a new function of AXL in promoting SpA remodeling and trophoblast invasion were demonstrated. The pregnant Axl knockout (Axl-/-) mice exhibited typical PE symptoms, including increased blood pressure and proteinuria. Artificially induced decidualization experiments showed that appeared normal, however, RNA-seq results of Axl-/- deciduoma revealed abnormal expression of a number of transcripts, including Corin, which encodes a cardiac protease that activates atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Treatment with ANP reversed the PE symptoms. Moreover, in decidua from women afflicted with PE, AXL level was significantly lower than that in normal pregnancies. These data show that the abnormality of decidua-derived AXL-CORIN-ANP affects maternal-fetal crosstalk and contributes to PE.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common causes of physical disability among older people and its incidence increases with age. Removal of the senescent cells (SNCs) delays OA pathologies, but little is known about the SNCs in OA synovium and their roles in OA pathogenesis. Here, we reported that RCAN1+IL1+ double-positive cells represent a senescent subset of synovial fibroblasts which accelerate cartilage degeneration via saturated fatty acids (SFAs). Using single-cell RNA sequencing and synovial organoids, we found that IL1+ senescent synovial fibroblasts mainly located at lining layer of human OA synovium and promote cartilage degeneration. We performed genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens to identify novel regulators of cell-surface bounded IL1 in senescent cells. RCAN1, which was a hit as positive regulator of IL1, governs the cellular senescence and pro-degenerative senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Mechanistically, we found that RCAN1 mediated the secretion of SFAs from senescent synovial fibroblasts, which promote chondrocytes senescence and cartilage matrix degradation. Intra-articular delivery of synovium-targeted anti-Rcan1 siRNA ameliorates the development of post-traumatic OA in mice, while reducing of SNCs accumulation in synovium and increasing cartilage regeneration. Last, co-culture experiments of human OA cartilage explant with synovial organoids confirmed that RCAN1 silencing in human synovial fibroblasts suppressed chondrocyte senescence and cartilage degradation. Thus, our study revealed a pro-degenerative interaction between RCAN1+IL1+ senescent synovial fibroblasts and chondrocytes through secreted lipid mediators in OA progression. And targeted RCAN1 inhibition in senescent synovium is a promising approach for restore the joint homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Efficient regulation of cellular processes is essential for both endogenous and synthetic biological processes. The design of biomolecular feedback controllers that achieve robust and timely regulation is the subject of considerable research at the interface between synthetic biology and control theory. Integral feedback controllers, known for their ability to confer the property of Robust Perfect Adaptation (RPA), are increasingly becoming common features in biological control design. Antithetic integral feedback (AIF) controllers, in particular, have enabled effective chemical reaction realizations of integral controllers that deliver RPA in both deterministic and stochastic settings. This paved the way to experimental implementations of integral controllers in bacterial and mammalian cells. While AIF controllers deliver favorable adaptation properties, they do not necessarily lead to good transient performance or noise reduction properties and may in some cases lead to increased overshoot or cell-to-cell variability. These limitations are commonly circumvented by augmenting new circuitry that realize proportional or derivative feedback mechanisms to enhance dynamic and noise rejection features without affecting the AIF controllers adaptation properties. In this paper, we report that a sensor-based variant of the basic AIF motif exhibits favorable transient dynamic properties and (as reported elsewhere) reduced noise variance. We show that these features are attributed to a \"hidden\" proportional feedback component that is inherent in the controller structure and that such mechanism is solely responsible for the controllers underlying enhanced dynamic performance and noise rejection properties. This sensor-based AIF controller hence offers a minimal biomolecular realization of Proportional-Integral (PI) control, whereby both integral and proportional feedback mechanisms are achieved through a single actuation reaction.",

    "abstract": "The accurate characterization of cortical functional connectivity from Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data remains a challenging problem due to the subjective nature of the analysis, which requires several decisions at each step of the analysis pipeline, such as the choice of a source estimation algorithm, a connectivity metric and a cortical parcellation, to name but a few. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of selecting the regularization parameter in minimum norm estimates with caution, as variations in its value can result in significant differences in connectivity estimates. In particular, the amount of regularization that is optimal for MEG source estimation can actually be suboptimal for coherence-based MEG connectivity analysis. In this study, we expand upon previous work by examining a broader range of commonly used connectivity metrics, including the imaginary part of coherence, corrected imaginary part of Phase Locking Value, and weighted Phase Lag Index, within a larger and more realistic simulation scenario. Our results show that the best estimate of connectivity is achieved using a regularization parameter that is 1 or 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the one that yields the best source estimation. This remarkable difference may imply that previous work assessing source-space connectivity using minimum-norm may have benefited from using less regularization, as this may have helped reduce false positives. Importantly, we provide the code for MEG data simulation and analysis, offering the research community a valuable open source tool for informed selections of the regularization parameter when using minimum-norm for source space connectivity analyses.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe regularization parameter of the Minimum Norm Estimate of neural activity impacts connectivity estimation\nC_LIO_LIWe study empirically the optimal parameter for connectivity estimation using realistic synthetic datasets\nC_LIO_LIWe find the optimal parameter for connectivity estimation is systematically smaller than the optimal parameter for source imaging; different connectivity metrics yield the same result\nC_LIO_LICode and data are available open source.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cells are equipped to defend themselves from invading pathogens through sensors such as cGAS, which upon binding DNA induces type I interferon (IFN) expression. Whilst IFNs are crucial for limiting viral infection and activating adaptive immunity, uncontrolled production causes excessive inflammation and autoimmunity. cGAS binds DNA of both pathogenic and cellular origin and its activity is therefore tightly regulated. This is particularly apparent during mitosis, where cGAS association with chromatin following nuclear membrane dissolution and phosphorylation by mitotic kinases negatively regulate enzymatic activity. Here we describe a novel mechanism by which DNA sensing and other innate immune pathways are regulated during cell division, dependent on cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6. Inhibition of CDK4/6 using chemical inhibitors, shRNA-mediated depletion, or overexpression of cellular CDK4/6 inhibitor p16INK4a, greatly enhanced DNA- or cGAMP-induced expression of cytokines and IFN-stimulated genes (ISG). Mechanistically, CDK4/6-dependent inhibition mapped downstream of cytoplasmic signalling events including STING and IRF3 phosphorylation, limiting innate immune induction at the level of IFN{beta} mRNA expression. This regulation was universal, occurring in primary and transformed cells of human and murine origin, and broad, as IFN{beta} expression was inhibited in a CDK4/6-dependent manner downstream of multiple pattern recognition receptors. Together these findings demonstrate that host innate responses are limited by multiple mechanisms during cell division, thus defining cellular replication as an innate immune privileged process that may be necessary to avoid aberrant self-recognition and autoimmunity.",

We found that treatment of circadian enhancing agents, nobiletin and SR8278, reduced infection of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) in epidermal explants and human keratinocytes in a Bmal1/Clock-dependent manner. Circadian enhancing treatment also reversed susceptibility of aging murine skin and human primary keratinocytes to viral infection.

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough the anti-PD-1+LAG-3 and the anti-PD-1+CTLA-4 combinations are effective in advanced melanoma it remains unclear whether their mechanisms of action and resistance overlap.\n\nMethodsWe used single cell (sc) RNA-seq, flow cytometry and IHC analysis of responding SM1 and B16 melanoma flank tumors and SM1 brain metastases to explore the mechanism of action of the anti-PD-1+LAG-3 and the anti-PD-1+CTLA-4 combination. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell depletion and ELISPOT assays were used to demonstrate the unique role of CD4+ T cell help in the anti-tumor effects of the anti-PD-1+LAG-3 combination. Tetramer assays confirmed the loss of CD8+ tumor-reactive T cells in brain tumors resistant to the anti-PD-1+LAG-3 combination.\n\nResultsThe anti-PD-1+CTLA-4 combination was associated with the infiltration of FOXP3+ regulatory CD4+ cells (Tregs), fewer activated CD4+ T cells and the accumulation of a subset of IFN{gamma} secreting cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, whereas the anti-PD-1+LAG-3 combination led to the accumulation of CD4+ T helper cells that expressed CXCR4, TNFSF8, IL21R and a subset of CD8+ T cells with reduced expression of cytotoxic markers. T cell depletion studies showed a requirement for CD4+ T cells for the anti-PD-1+LAG-3 combination, but not the PD-1-CTLA-4 combination at both flank and brain tumor sites. In anti-PD-1+LAG-3 treated tumors, CD4+ T cell depletion was associated with fewer activated (CD69+) CD8+ T cells, impaired IFN{gamma} release and increased numbers of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) but, conversely, increased numbers of activated CD8+ T cells and IFN{gamma} release in anti-PD-1+CTLA-4 treated tumors. Analysis of relapsing melanoma brain metastases from anti-PD-1+LAG-3 treated mice showed an increased accumulation of MDSCs and a loss of gp100+ tumor reactive CD8+ T cells. An analysis of the inferred cell-cell interactions from the scRNA-seq data suggested the MDSCs interacted with multiple subsets of T cells in a bi-directional manner.\n\nConclusionsTogether these studies suggest that these two clinically relevant ICI combinations have differential effects upon CD4+ T cell polarization, which in turn, impacted cytotoxic CD8+ T cell function. Further insights into the mechanisms of action/resistance of these clinically-relevant ICI combinations will allow therapy to be further personalized.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining the past decades current genetic gains for tree species is a challenging task for foresters and tree breeders due to biotic and abiotic factors. Planting a mixture of genotypes or clonal composites can be an alternative to increase the phytosanitary security and yield of forest plantations. These clonal composites are more complex than monocultures due to inter-genotypic competition and indirect genetic effects that can affect the total heritable variation. This study aims to understand how indirect genetic effects can impact the response to selection and how the stand composition can be used to explore these effects and enhance forest yield. We used a clonally trial of Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis hybrids in a randomized complete block design with 24 replications, containing a single tree per plot evaluated for mean annual increment at 3 and 6 years. We focus on partitioning the genetic variation of trees into direct and indirect genetic effects based on competition intensity factors. We identified clones as aggressive, homeostatic, and sensitive based on the magnitude of indirect genetic effects. By accounting for indirect genetic effects, for mean annual increment, the total heritability decreased 39 and 44% for 3 and 6 years, respectively. We proposed a workflow that uses the direct and indirect genetic effect to predict the mean value of clonal composite combinations and to select the one with highest yield. Our methodology accounted for spatial variability and interplot competition that can contribute to the total heritable variance and response to selection in forest trials. Based on the models evaluated, the clones are easily classified according to their deviation from the indirect genetic effects mean. Also, we extract useful information to predict different clonal composites compositions, their expected average performance, and define the best recommended combination to be planted in large scale.",

    "abstract": "Enterolactone (EL) is a product of gut-microbial metabolism of dietary plant lignans. Studies linking EL with breast cancer risk have bolstered investigations into its effects on the mammary epithelial cells, and the mechanisms thereof. While it binds to the estrogen receptor ; ER, its effect on the proliferation of mammary tumor cell lines is reportedly ambivalent; depending on its concentration. The genomic correlates of EL actions also remain unexplored. Here we have elaborately studied the effect of EL on proliferation of ER-positive, and ER-negative cell lines. 10 {micro}M EL significantly enhanced the growth of the ER-positive MCF-7 or T47D breast cancer cells, but not the ER-negative MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-453 cells. In MCF-7 cells, it significantly increased the expression of TFF1 mRNA, an estrogen-induced transcript. The binding of ER to the estrogen response element within the TFF1 locus further demonstrates the pro-estrogenic effect of 10 {micro}M EL. We further explored the genome-wide transcriptomic effect of 10 {micro}M EL. Analysis of RNA-seq data obtained from control- or 10 {micro}M EL treated-MCF-7 cells revealed modulation of expression of diverse sets of functionally related genes, which reflected cell cycle progression, rather than cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. The manner in which 10 {micro}M EL regulated the hallmark G2/M checkpoint, and estrogen-response-late genes correlated with proliferation inducing, and estrogen-like effects of EL on MCF-7 cells.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere has been a concerted effort at establishing the best method for the measurement of initial rates for various purposes, including the calculation of kinetic parameters, the maximum velocity (Vmax), and the Michaelis-Menten constant (KM).\n\nObjectivesThe objectives of this research are: 1) to derive equations without KM for the determination of the Vmax in particular and vice versa; 2) to determine the KM and Vmax with other equations other than the Michaelian equation; and 3) to subject the calculated and extrapolated kinetic parameters to pseudo- statistical remediation where necessary as a test of their viability and usefulness.\n\nMethodsThe study was experimental and theoretical. It is supported by the Bernfeld method of enzyme assay.\n\nResultBy graphical means, the Vmax and KM values for galactosidase respectively range between 163 and 185 M/min and between 2.07 and 2.77 mg/L; the range by calculations is 177 and 214 M/min and 2.45 and 3.311 mg/L, subject to pseudo-statistical remediation. Overall, the ranges of Vmax and KM values for alpha-amylase from both the graphical method and calculation are, respectively, 1.095 to 1.018 mM/min and 18.15 to 20.554 g/L.\n\nConclusionThe equations for the determination of the KM and Vmax, which are respectively invariant with respect to each other, were rederived. The initial rates must not be a mixture of both if the true KM and Vmax are of interest. The new pseudo-statistical method for the remediation of error in all measurements, if necessary, is viable, useful, and robust.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=82 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/537023v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@824dfaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cd95e5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12c0771org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19cb86d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOA:C_FLOATNO Plots where conditions that validate a very high incidence of rQSSA are the case: [ET] is >>[ST].\n\nPlot of v1 to v5 versus [ST]1 to [ST]5 gave equation of linear regression (double reciprocal plot (drp)) such as: y = (0.08x - 0.0002) exp.

This implies that minor issues that are ignored can ultimately flaw a post-doctoral thesis by high-ranking researchers. Needless to give an example, but what needs to be taken home is that if an enzyme is very active with a given drug (and even food) to be activated, care should be taken to ensure that a low concentration of drug needs to be administered. In the management of diabetics, starchy foods containing resistant starches are recommended for the same reason.",

    "abstract": "Comprehensive collections approaching millions of sequenced genomes have become central information sources in the life sciences. However, the rapid growth of these collections makes it effectively impossible to search these data using tools such as BLAST and its successors. Here, we present a technique called phylogenetic compression, which uses evolutionary history to guide compression and efficiently search large collections of microbial genomes using existing algorithms and data structures. We show that, when applied to modern diverse collections approaching millions of genomes, lossless phylogenetic compression improves the compression ratios of assemblies, de Bruijn graphs, and k-mer indexes by one to two orders of magnitude. Additionally, we develop a pipeline for a BLAST-like search over these phylogeny-compressed reference data, and demonstrate it can align genes, plasmids, or entire sequencing experiments against all sequenced bacteria until 2019 on ordinary desktop computers within a few hours. Phylogenetic compression has broad applications in computational biology and may provide a fundamental design principle for future genomics infrastructure.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that computational pathology not only automate the tumor diagnosis, but also showed great potential to uncover tumor-related genetic alterations and transcriptomic patterns. In this paper, we propose wsi2rppa, a weakly supervised contrastive learning framework to infer the protein levels of tumor biomarkers from whole slide images (WSIs) in breast cancer. We firstly conducted contrastive learning-based pre-training on tessellated tiles to extract histopathological features, which are then aggregated by attention pooling and adapted to downstream tasks. Our extensive experiments showed that our method achieved state-of-the-art performance in tumor diagnostic task, and also performed well in predicting clinically relevant protein levels and drug response. To show the model interpretability, we spatially visualized the WSIs colored the tiles by their attention scores, and found that the regions with high scores were highly consistent with the tumor and necrotic regions annotated by a 10-year experienced pathologist. Moreover, spatial transcriptomic data further verified that the heatmap generated by attention scores agree greatly with the spatial expression landscape of two typical tumor biomarker genes. In particular, our method achieved 0.79 AUC value in predicting the response of breast cancer patients to the drug trastuzumab treatment. These findings showed the remarkable potential of deep learning-based morphological feature is very indicative of clinically relevant protein levels, drug response and clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Neurons are remarkably polarized structures: dendrites spread and branch to receive synaptic inputs while a single axon extends and transmits action potentials to downstream targets. Neuronal polarity is maintained by the axon initial segment (AIS), a region between the soma and axon proper that is also the site of action potential (AP) generation. This polarization between dendrites and axons extends to inhibitory neurotransmission. In adulthood, the neurotransmitter GABA hyperpolarizes dendrites but instead depolarizes axons. These differences in function collide at the AIS. Multiple studies have shown that GABAergic signaling in this region can share properties of either the mature axon or mature dendrite, and that these properties evolve over a protracted period encompassing periadolescent development. Here, we explored how developmental changes in GABAergic signaling affect AP initiation. We show that GABA at the axon initial segment inhibits action potential initiation in Layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in prefrontal cortex from mice of either sex across GABA reversal potentials observed in periadolescence. These actions occur largely through current shunts generated by GABAA receptors and changes in voltage-gated channel properties that affected the number of channels that could be recruited for AP electrogenesis. These results suggest that GABAergic neurons targeting the axon initial segment provide an inhibitory \"veto\" across the range of GABA polarity observed in normal adolescent development, regardless of GABAergic synapse reversal potential.",
