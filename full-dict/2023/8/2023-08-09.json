    "abstract": "BackgroundBerberine, which is a naturally occurring alkaloid is widely explored for several health benefits including for weight management and metabolic disorders. The major pharmacological action of berberine is reported to be by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, while its other clinical outcomes are devoid of clear mechanism of action/s. Hence in this study a detailed pharmacology of berberine and its two major metabolites (berberrubine, and jatrorrhizine) in humans was evaluated using well established Insilco tools.\n\nMaterials and MethodsThe targets of berberine and its metabolites were identified in SwissTargetPrediction server and their affinity was assed using AutoDock vina 1.2.0. The binding pockets of the highest ligand receptor combinations was assessed using the PrankWeb: Ligand Binding Site Prediction tool.\n\nResultsKinases, enzymes and family A GPCRs were identified as the top three target category of berberine and its metabolites. ROCK2, PIK3CD, KCNMA1, CSF1R and KIT were observed to be the high affinity targets of berberine and its metabolites with affinity values of <4 uM. The affinity of berberine and its metabolites against all AMPKs and lipid/glucose regulator targets (LDLR, DDP4 and PCSK9) were > 10 uM. The IC50 value of berberine and its metabolites against ROCK2 was the least (<1 uM), while their other high affinity targets (PIK3CD, KCNMA1, CSF1R and KIT) showed IC50 values < 5 uM.\n\nConclusionThe diverse range of protein targets and the observed novel high affinity targets (ROCK2, PIK3CD, KCNMA1, CSF1R and KIT) offer valuable insights into the potential mechanisms of action and therapeutic effects of berberine and its metabolites in various disease conditions, which warrants validation in suitable efficacy analysis studies.",

    "abstract": "Obesity-induced inflammation causes metabolic dysfunction, but the mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that the innate immune transcription factor interferon regulatory factor (IRF3) adversely affects glucose homeostasis through induction of the endogenous FAHFA hydrolase androgen induced gene 1 (AIG1) in adipocytes. Adipocyte-specific knockout of IRF3 protects mice against high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance, whereas overexpression of IRF3 or AIG1 in adipocytes promotes insulin resistance on a high-fat diet. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of AIG1 reversed obesity-induced insulin resistance and restored glucose homeostasis in the setting of adipocyte IRF3 overexpression. We, therefore, identify the adipocyte IRF3/AIG1 axis as a crucial link between obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance and suggest an approach for limiting the metabolic dysfunction accompanying obesity.",

    "abstract": "Flow cytometry enables quantitative measurements of fluorescence in single cells. The technique was widely used for immunology to identify populations with different surface protein markers. More recently, the usage of flow cytometry has been extended to additional readouts, including intracellular proteins and fluorescent protein transgenes, and is widely utilized to study development, systems biology, microbiology, and many other fields. A common file format (FCS format, defined by International Society for Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC)) has been universally adopted, facilitating data exchange between different machines. A diverse spectrum of software packages have been developed for analysis of flow cytometry data. However, those are either 1) costly proprietary softwares, 2) open source packages with prerequisite installation of R or Python and sometimes require users to have experience in coding or 3) online tools that are limiting for analysis of large data sets. Here we present EasyFlow, an open source flow cytometry analysis GUI based on Matlab or Python, that can be installed and run locally cross-platform-ly (Windows and MacOS), without prerequisite user having previous knowledge on coding. The python version (EasyFlowQ) is also developed on a popular plotting framework (Matplotlib) and modern user interface (UI) toolkit (Qt), allowing more advanced users to customize and keep contributing to the software, as well as its tutorials. Overall, EasyFlow serves as a simple-to-use tool for inexperienced users with little coding experience to use locally, as well as a platform for advanced users to further customize for their own needs.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) databases play a vital role in bridging the gap between TCM and modern medicine, as well as in promoting the popularity of TCM. Elucidating the bioactive ingredients of Chinese medicinal materials is key to TCM modernization and new drug discovery. However, one drawback of current TCM databases is the lack of quantitative data on the constituents of Chinese medicinal materials. Herein, we present ccTCM, a web-based platform designed to provide a component and compound-content-based resource on TCM and analysis services for medical experts. In terms of design features, ccTCM combines resource distribution, similarity analysis, and molecular-mechanism analysis to accelerate the discovery of bioactive ingredients in TCM. ccTCM contains 273 Chinese medicinal materials commonly used in clinical settings, covering 29 functional classifications. By searching and comparing, we finally adopted 2043 studies, from which we collected the compounds contained in each TCM with content greater than 0.001%, and a total of 1 449 were extracted. Subsequently, we collected 40767 compound-target pairs by integrating multiple databases. Taken together, ccTCM is a versatile platform for that can be used by TCM scientists to perform scientific and clinical TCM studies based on quantified ingredients of Chinese medicinal materials. ccTCM is freely accessible at http://www.cctcm.org.cn.",

Considering that these potential diagnostic and prognostic factors may be regulated by events that do not imply variation in protein abundance levels, we investigated the hypothesis that changes in protein conformation can be associated with diagnosis and prognosis, revealing biological processes and novel targets of clinical relevance. For this, we employed limited proteolysis-mass spectrometry in saliva samples to explore structural alterations, comparing the proteome of healthy control and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients, with and without lymph node metastasis. Fifty-one proteins with potential structural rearrangements were associated with clinical patient features. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, disulfide bond, and phosphorylation, were also investigated in our data using different search engines and in silico analysis indicating that they might contribute to structural rearrangements of the potential diagnostic and prognostic markers here identified. Altogether, this powerful approach allows for a deep investigation of complex biofluids, such as saliva, advancing the search for targets for oral cancer diagnosis and prognosis.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=187 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/552034v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (60K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d0f97dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ab9a2borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16baf1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4b4a37_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Oral cancer progression is associated with potential structural rearrangements.\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Viral mutations are the primary cause of mismatches in primer-target hybridisation, affecting the sensibility of molecular techniques, potentially leading to detection dropouts. Despite its importance, little is known about the quantitative effect of mismatches in primer-target hybridisation. We use up-to-date and highly detailed thermodynamic model parameters of DNA mismatches to evaluate the sensibility to variants of SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP primers. We aligned 18 RT-LAMP primer sets, which were underwent clinical validation, to the genomes of Wuhan strain (ws), 7 variants and 4 subvariants, and calculated hybridisation temperatures allowing up to three consecutive mismatches. We calculate the coverage when the mismatched melting temperature falls by more than 5{degrees}C in comparison to the matched alignments. If no mismatches are considered, the average coverage found would be 94% for ws, falling the lowest value for Omicron: 84%. However, considering mismatches the coverage is much higher: 97% (ws) to 88% (Omicron). Stabilizing mismatches (higher melting temperatures), account for roughly 1/3 of this increase. The number of primer dropouts increases for new each variant, however the effect is much less severe if mismatches are considered. We suggest using melting temperature calculations to continuously assess the trend of primer dropouts.",

While there is great potential for strategically incorporating CREs in therapeutic or biotechnology applications that require tissue specificity, there is no guarantee that an optimal CRE for an intended purpose has arisen naturally through evolution. Here, we present a platform to engineer and validate synthetic CREs capable of driving gene expression with programmed cell type specificity. We leverage innovations in deep neural network modeling of CRE activity across three cell types, efficient in silico optimization, and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to design and empirically test thousands of CREs. Through in vitro and in vivo validation, we show that synthetic sequences outperform natural sequences from the human genome in driving cell type-specific expression. Synthetic sequences leverage unique sequence syntax to promote activity in the on-target cell type and simultaneously reduce activity in off-target cells. Together, we provide a generalizable framework to prospectively engineer CREs and demonstrate the required literacy to write regulatory code that is fit-for-purpose in vivo across vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) poses significant challenges to global tuberculosis (TB) control. Host-directed therapies (HDT) offer a novel approach for TB treatment by enhancing immune-mediated clearance of Mtb. Prior preclinical studies found that inhibition of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an enzyme involved in heme metabolism, with tin-protoporphyrin IX (SnPP) significantly reduced mouse lung bacillary burden alone and when co-administered with the first-line antitubercular regimen. Here we evaluated the adjunctive HDT activity of a novel HO-1 inhibitor, stannsoporfin (SnMP), in combination with a novel MDR-TB regimen containing human-equivalent doses comprising a next-generation diarylquinoline, TBAJ-876 (S), pretomanid (Pa), and a new oxazolidinone, TBI-223 (O) (collectively, SPaO) in Mtb-infected BALB/c mice. After 4 weeks of treatment, SPaO + SnMP 5 mg/kg reduced mean lung bacillary burden by an additional 0.69 log10 (P=0.0145) relative to SPaO alone. As early as two weeks post-treatment initiation, SnMP adjunctive therapy differentially altered the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, and CD38, a marker of M1 macrophages. Next, we evaluated the sterilizing potential of SnMP adjunctive therapy in a BALB/c relapse model. After six weeks of treatment, SPaO + SnMP 10 mg/kg reduced lung bacterial burdens to 0.71 {+/-} 0.23 log10 CFU, a 0.78 log-fold greater decrease in lung CFU compared to SpaO alone. Although adjunctive SnMP did not reduce microbiological relapse rates after 6 weeks of treatment, mice receiving this regimen exhibited the lowest lung CFU upon relapse. SnMP is a promising HDT candidate requiring further study in combination with regimens for drug-resistant TB.",

    "abstract": "The magnitude and duration of vertebrate viremia are critical determinants of arbovirus transmission, geographic spread, and disease severity--yet, mechanisms determining arbovirus viremia levels are poorly defined. Previous studies have drawn associations between in vitro virion-glycosaminoglycan (GAG) interactions and in vivo clearance kinetics of virions from blood circulation. From these observations, it is commonly hypothesized that GAG-binding virions are rapidly removed from circulation due to ubiquitous expression of GAGs by vascular endothelial cells, thereby limiting viremia. Using an in vivo model for viremia, we compared the vascular clearance of low and enhanced GAG-binding viral variants of chikungunya (CHIKV), eastern-(EEEV), and Venezuelan-(VEEV) equine encephalitis viruses. We find GAG-binding virions are more quickly removed from circulation than their non-GAG-binding variant; however individual clearance kinetics vary between GAG-binding viruses, from swift (VEEV) to slow removal from circulation (EEEV). Remarkably, we find phagocytes are required for efficient vascular clearance of some enhanced GAG-binding virions. Moreover, transient depletion of vascular heparan sulfate (HS) impedes vascular clearance of only some GAG-binding viral variants and in a phagocyte-dependent manner, implying phagocytes can mediate vascular GAG-virion interactions. Finally, in direct contrast to mice, we find enhanced GAG-binding EEEV is resistant to vascular clearance in avian hosts, suggesting the existence of species-specificity in virion-GAG interactions. In summary, these data support a role for GAG-mediated clearance of some viral particles from the blood circulation, illuminate the potential of blood-contacting phagocytes as a site for GAG-virion binding, and suggest a role for species-specific GAG structures in arbovirus ecology.\n\nSignificance StatementPreviously, evidence of arbovirus-GAG interactions in vivo has been limited to associations between viral residues shown to promote enhanced GAG-binding phenotypes in vitro and in vivo phenotypes of viral dissemination and pathogenesis. By directly manipulating host GAG expression, we identified virion-GAG interactions in vivo and discovered a role for phagocyte-expressed GAGs in viral vascular clearance. Moreover, we observe species-specific differences in viral vascular clearance of enhanced GAG-binding virions between murine and avian hosts. These data suggest species-specific variation in GAG structure is a mechanism to distinguish amplifying from dead-end hosts for arbovirus transmission.",

    "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are considered ecosystem engineers, however, the exact mechanisms by which they modify and influence their immediate surroundings are largely unknown and difficult to study in soil. In this study, we used microfluidic chips, simulating artificial soil structures, to study foraging strategies and habitat modification of Rhizophagus irregularis in symbiotic state associated to carrot roots. Our results suggest that AMF hyphae forage over long distances in void spaces, prefer straight over tortuous passages, anastomose and show strong inducement of branching when encountering obstacles. We observed bi-directional vesicle transport inside active hyphae and documented strategic allocation of biomass within the mycelium e.g., truncated hyphal growth and cytoplasm retraction from inefficient paths. We found R. irregularis able to modify pore-spaces in the chips by producing irregularly shaped spores that filled up pores. We suggest that studying AMF hyphal behaviour in spatial settings can explain phenomena reported at bulk scale such as AMF modification of water retention in soils. The use of microfluidic soil chips in AMF research opens up novel opportunities to under very controlled conditions study ecophysiology and interactions of the mycelium with both biotic and abiotic factors.",

    "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii has gained prominence due to its heightened antibiotic resistance and adaptability within healthcare settings. Unlike other Acinetobacter species, A. baumannii predominantly thrives within healthcare environments, where its persistence is underscored by physiological adaptations, including homeoviscous adaptation that modifies glycerophospholipids (GPL) to enhance membrane flexibility. The bacteriums substantial genetic diversity highlights the paramount importance of prudent strain selection for research involving drug resistance and virulence. This study investigates the lipid composition of six clinical A. baumannii strains, incorporating the highly virulent model strain AB5075 with multiple antibiotic resistances. Our objective is to scrutinize the adaptations of glycerophospholipids (GPL) and glycerolipids (GL) within these isolated strains, each characterized by unique antibiotic resistance profiles, under variable temperature conditions mimicking environmental and physiological scenarios. The strains differential performance in motilities and biofilm formation across varying temperatures reveals intriguing patterns. Notably, the study uncovers a consistent elevation in palmitoleic acid (C16:1) content in five of the six strains at 18{degrees}C. Utilizing LC-HRMS2 analysis, we elucidate shifts in GPL and GL compositions as temperatures oscillate between 18{degrees}C and 37{degrees}C for all strains. Exploration of lipid subspecies further exposes disparities in PE and PG lipids containing C16:1 and oleic acid (C18:1). This investigation not only provides insights into the physiological attributes and survival strategies of A. baumannii but also deepens our comprehension of its adaptive responses to temperature changes. By unraveling the dynamics of lipid composition and fatty acid profiles, this study enriches our understanding of the bacteriums ecological fitness and behavior in diverse environments.\n\nIMPORTANCEAcinetobacter baumannii, a bacterium known for its resistance to antibiotics, is a concern in healthcare settings. This study focused on understanding how this bacterium adapts to different temperatures and how its lipid composition changes. Lipids are like the building blocks of its cell membranes. By studying these changes, scientists can gain insights into how the bacterium survives and behaves in various environments. This knowledge helps us better understand its ability to cause infections and resist treatments. The studys findings contribute to our broader understanding of how Acinetobacter baumannii functions, which is important for developing strategies to combat its impact on patient health.",

    "abstract": "Strain M1325/93/1 (= GFKo1) of Lelliottia amnigena was isolated from the lung of a harbour porpoise in 1993. The genome sequence and antimicrobial resistance profile (genomic, phenotypic) of the strain were generated, with the genomic data compared with those from closely related bacteria. We demonstrate the recently described chromosomally-encoded AmpC {beta}-lactamase blaLAQ is a core gene of L. amnigena, and suggest new variants of this class of lactamase are encoded by other members of the genus Lelliottia. Although presence of blaLAQ is ubiquitous across the currently sequenced members of L. amnigena, we highlight that strain GFKo1 is sensitive to ampicillin and cephalosporins. These data suggest blaLAQ may act as a useful genetic marker for identification of L. amnigena strains, but its presence may not correlate with expected phenotypic resistances. Further studies are required to determine the regulatory mechanisms of blaLAQ in L. amnigena.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of new proteins is a central question in biology. Most tertiary protein folds known to date appear to have an ancient origin, but it is clear from bioinformatic analyses that new proteins continuously emerge in all organismal groups. However, there is a paucity of experimental data on new proteins regarding their structure and biophysical properties. We performed a detailed phylogenetic analysis and identified 48 putative open reading frames in the honeybee-associated bacterium Apilactobacillus kunkeei for which no homologs could be identified in closely-related species, suggesting that they could be relatively new on an evolutionary time scale and represent recently evolved proteins. Using circular dichroism-, fluorescence- and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy we investigated five of these proteins and show that they are not intrinsically disordered, but populate alpha-helical dominated folded states with relatively low thermodynamic stability (0-3 kcal/mol). The data demonstrate that small new proteins readily adopt simple folded conformations suggesting that more complex tertiary structures can be continuously re-invented during evolution by fusion of such simple secondary structure elements. These findings have implications for the general view on protein evolution, where de novo emergence of folded proteins may be a common event.",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of cell identity faces many challenges during mitosis, as most DNA-binding proteins are evicted from DNA and transcription is virtually abolished. How cells maintain their identity through cell division and faithfully re-initiate gene expression during mitotic exit is unclear. Here, we developed a novel reporter system enabling cell cycle synchronization-free separation of pluripotent stem cells in temporal bins of < 30 minutes during mitotic exit. This allowed us to quantify genome-wide reactivation of transcription, sequential changes in chromatin accessibility, and re-binding of the pluripotency transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG (OSN). We found that transcriptional activity progressively ramped up after mitosis and that OSN rapidly reoccupied the genome during the anaphase-telophase transition. We also demonstrate transcription factor-specific, dynamic relocation patterns and a hierarchical reorganization of the OSN binding landscape governed by OCT4 and SOX2. Our study sheds light on the dynamic orchestration of transcriptional reactivation after mitosis.",

    "abstract": "Chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid biosynthesis, which occur almost simultaneously during fruit ripening, are essential for coloration and nutritional value of fruits. However, the synergistic regulation of these two processes at transcriptional level remains largely unknown. Here, we identified a novel WRKY transcription factor CrWRKY42 from the transcriptome data of the yellowish bud mutant  Jinlegan tangor (MT) and its wild type  Shiranuhi tangor (WT), which was involved in the transcriptional regulation of both chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid biosynthesis pathways. CrWRKY42 activated the expression of {beta}-carotene hydroxylase 1 (CrBCH1) by directly binding to its promoter. Overexpression and interference of CrWRKY42 in citrus calli demonstrated that CrWRKY42 promoted carotenoid accumulation by inducing the expression of multiple carotenoid biosynthetic genes. Further assays confirmed that CrWRKY42 also directly bound to and activated the promoters of the genes involved in the carotenoid biosynthesis, including phytoene desaturase (CrPDS) and lycopene {beta}-cyclase 2 (CrLCYB2). In addition, CrWRKY42 could also bind to the promoter of STAY-GREEN (CrSGR) and activated its expression, thus promoting chlorophyll degradation. Overexpression and silencing of CrWRKY42 in citrus fruits indicated that CrWRKY42 positively regulated chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid biosynthesis by synergistically activating the expressions of genes involved in both pathways. In conclusion, our data revealed that CrWRKY42 acted as a positive regulator of chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid biosynthesis to alter the conversion of citrus fruit color. Our findings provide insight into the complex transcriptional regulation of chlorophyll and carotenoid metabolism during fruit ripening.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe CrWRKY42 transcription factor coordinates chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid biosynthesis by directly regulating genes involved in these pathways to alter the conversion of citrus fruit color.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is characterized by aberrant and excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, termed fibrosis. Fibrotic remodelling is typically triggered by inflammation, which occurs systemically in obesity. Despite the contribution of fibrosis to adverse clinical outcomes and disease progression, there are no available treatments for this condition. Developing therapeutics for chronic conditions requires an understanding of in vivo ECM regulation, and how the ECM responds to a systemic challenge. We have therefore developed a Drosophila model for obesity via chronic high fat diet feeding and evaluated the response of the cardiac ECM to this metabolic challenge. We found that this model displays a striking disorganization of the cardiac ECM, with corresponding deficits in heart function. Our study shows that different genotypes tolerate varying levels of high fat diets, and that some genotypes may require a different percentage of fat supplementation for achieving an optimal obesity phenotype.",

However, the mechanisms by which AMP sensing is disrupted in CKD are unclear. In this study, we identified mechanisms of energy homeostasis in which Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1)-dependent phosphorylation of AMPK{gamma}1 at Ser260/Thr262 promotes AMP sensitivity of AMPK. AMPK activation by AMP was impaired in Ulk1-/- mice despite an increased AMP/ATP ratio. We also demonstrated that MK8722, an allosteric AMPK activator, activates AMPK in the kidneys of a CKD mouse model via a pathway that is independent of AMP sensing.

    "abstract": "Disturbed cholesterol homeostasis is associated with multiple diseases, such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, lysosomal storage disorders, and neurodegenerative disorders. The endo-lysosomal network plays a central role in the distribution of cholesterol between subcellular membranes, but the processes controlling this transport are still not well-defined. Here, we investigate the impact of hepatic Retromer, an endosomal sorting complex consisting of VPS35, VPS26, and VPS29, on cholesterol homeostasis by using a liver-specific VPS35-deficient (Vps35HepKO) mouse model. Hepatic VPS35 deficiency strongly reduces the function of the lysosomal proteins lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), scavenger receptor class B member 2 (SCARB2), and Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1), concomitant with hepatic cholesterol accumulation in lysosomal compartments, delayed transport of endocytosed cholesterol through the endo-lysosomal network, and increased cholesterol biosynthesis. In addition, the levels and intracellular distribution of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and LDLR-related protein 1 (LRP1) are affected, likely explaining increased plasma LDL-cholesterol in Vps35HepKO mice. High-fat/high-cholesterol diet feeding exacerbates hepatic and plasma cholesterol content in Vps35HepKO mice and leads to mild liver injury, hepatic inflammation, and increased hepatocellular proliferation. Altogether, we here uncover that, in addition to its established function in the endosomal sorting of integral membrane proteins, Retromer plays a key role in lysosomal cholesterol egress.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin remodeling is required for essential cellular processes, including DNA replication, DNA repair, and transcription regulation. The ciliate germline and soma are partitioned into two distinct nuclei within the same cell. During a massive editing process that forms a somatic genome, ciliates eliminate thousands of DNA sequences from a germline genome copy in the form of internal eliminated sequences (IESs). Recently we showed that the chromatin remodeler ISWI1 is required for somatic genome development in the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia. Here we describe two paralogous proteins, ICOP1 and ICOP2, essential for DNA elimination. ICOP1 and ICOP2 are highly divergent from known proteins; the only domain detected showed distant homology to the WSD motif. We show that both ICOP1 and ICOP2 interact with the chromatin remodeler ISWI1. Upon ICOP knockdown, changes in alternative IES excision boundaries and nucleosome densities are similar to those observed for ISWI1 knockdown. We thus propose that a complex comprising ISWI1 and either or both ICOP1 and ICOP2 are needed for chromatin remodeling and accurate DNA elimination in Paramecium.",

    "abstract": "The tympanic membrane (or ear drum) is found at the interface between the middle ear and the external ear. The membrane is composed of three layers of different embryonic origin: an outer ectodermally-derived layer, a middle neural crest-derived fibroblast layer with contribution from the mesoderm-derived vasculature, and an inner endodermally-derived mucosal layer. These layers form a thin sandwich which is often perforated as a consequence of trauma, pressure changes, or middle ear inflammation. Usually, the tympanic membrane heals with minimal scarring, but in 6% of cases the perforation fails to heal leading to hearing loss, tinnitus and pain requiring surgery. How cells bridge the gap to close the perforation is an interesting question, as this needs to happen in the absence of an initial scaffold. Here we assess the contribution, timing, and interaction of the different layers of the membrane during repair in the mouse using markers and reporter mouse lines. We show that the ectodermal layer retracts after perforation, before proliferating away from the wound edge, with Keratin 5 basal cells migrating over the hole to bridge the gap. The mesenchymal and mucosal layers then use this scaffold to complete the repair, in tandem with changes in the vasculature. Finally, differentiation of the epithelium leads to formation of a scab that falls off. Our results reveal the dynamics and interconnections between the embryonic germ layers during repair and highlight how defects in healing may occur. Unearthing the complexities of TM healing is important as chronic TMP is a common clinical issue with limited treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Xeroderma Pigmentosum C is a dermal hereditary disease. It is caused by a mutation in the DNA damage recognition protein XPC that belongs to the Nucleotide excision repair pathway. XPC patients exhibit a photosensitive phenotype and fail to repair UV induced DNA lesions leading to their accumulation and ultimate conversion to mutations and carcinomas. In an attempt to normalize this phenotype, we screened a library of siRNAs targeting the human kinases, given their role in different DNA repair pathways. WT and XPC immortalized patient fibroblasts were transfected with the library then irradiated with UVB to induce DNA damage. XPC phenotypic reversal was monitored by the quantification of decreased photosensitivity and increased DNA damage repair. Out of the 1292 kinase siRNAs tested, twenty-eight were selected cellular survival compared to cells transfected with non-targeting siRNA in XP-C irradiated cells. Out of the selected hits, two kinases, PIK3C3 and LATS1, induce more than 20% repair of 6-4PP DNA lesions. The down regulation of autophagy-related protein PIK3C3 alone had an exclusive photo protective effect on XP-C irradiated cells validated these effects also on primary XP-C patient fibroblasts and CRISPR-Cas9 generated XPC-KO keratinocytes. PIK3C3 knock down in XP-C cells ameliorated in UVB dose response analysis, decreased apoptosis and lowered phosphorylation of P53 with no effect on proliferation. More importantly, PIK3C3 knock down induced an increase in UVRAG expression, a previously reported cDNA conveying lower photosensitivity in XP-C cells. Attempts to improve the XPC photosensitive and deficient repair phenotype using PIK3C3 inhibitors could thus pave a way for new therapeutic approaches delaying or preventing tumor initiation.",

    "abstract": "Environmental DNA metabarcoding has become a widely used technique to detect animals from environmental samples and is on the brink of being implemented into routine species monitoring. Surprisingly, birds are among the taxonomic groups which until recently, received comparably little attention in eDNA research, a fact that is changing rapidly, with the growing number of air eDNA analyses. Since birds are hardly ever the most abundant species in aquatic or terrestrial habitats, a high specificity of the employed metabarcoding primers is key to limit non-target amplifications and enable reliable detection from environmental samples.\n\nHere, we present a novel primer pair (BirT) for metabarcoding of avian environmental DNA. We optimized specificity and fragment length regarding taxonomic resolution and available sequencing technology. Additionally, we evaluated the availability of 12S reference sequences for birds and filled database gaps by generating novel 12S barcodes. Finally, we tested the applicability of this approach using field-collected eDNA samples obtained with three different filter types. These results were compared to visual observations uploaded to eBird (www.eBird.org) during the sampling period.\n\nOur results confirm the suitability of the BirT primer pair for bird eDNA metabarcoding with optimized fragment length, no amplification of key non-target groups, and taxonomic resolution provided by the amplified fragment. Albeit there are still substantial gaps in the 12S reference sequence database, the analysis of bird eDNA from water samples resulted in species-level taxonomic resolution for 92% of the detected taxa. All tested filter/filtration combinations delivered similar results for total read numbers per sample (mean: 613,972 {+/-} 340,088 SD) and species detected per sample (mean: 5.5 {+/-} 2.3 SD). Ninety-five percent of the bird detections were highly plausible and 58% confirmed by visual observations. The majority of the detected bird species was closely associated with aquatic habitats confirming the suitability of water samples for the detection of waterfowl and species inhabiting similar ecological niches via eDNA.",

    "abstract": "Leishmania (L.) infantum is the main causative agent of animal and human leishmaniasis in the Mediterranean basin. Despite its clinical significance, little is known on the genetic diversity of L. infantum parasites circulating in Italy. Here, we apply a comparative genomics approach on seven L. infantum isolates from different hosts (human, dog, cat, marten) and geographic regions (Emilia-Romagna, Sicily, Sardinia) as a first attempt to explore the breadth of parasite genetic heterogeneity in Italy. We revealed important genome instability at karyotype levels, with each isolate presenting a unique aneuploidy profile. Read depth analysis further identified strain-specific changes in gene dosage, which affected important virulence factors most of which are encoded by multi-copy gene arrays, such as amastins or surface antigen-like proteins. SNP-based clustering analysis of these genomes together with over 80 publicly available L. infantum and L. donovani genomes placed the Italian isolates into three geographically distinct clusters, with two isolates grouping with Spanish strains, two isolates grouping with Tunisian strains, and three isolates clustering with putative L. infantum/L. donovani hybrids isolated in Cyprus. As judged by microsatellite profiling of 73 isolates from dogs, sand flies and VL cases, these hybrid isolates are representative of a sub-population of parasites circulating in northeastern Italy that preferentially infects humans, but not dogs. In conclusion, our data uncover a remarkable heterogeneity of L. infantum isolates that indicates different geographic origin, including a novel hybrid-like genotype associated with an unusual infection pattern, placing Italy at the crossroad of Leishmania infection in the Mediterranean region.",

    "abstract": "tRNAs are not only essential for decoding the genetic code, but their abundance also has a strong impact on the rate of protein production, folding, and on the stability of their encoding messenger RNAs. Plasmodium expresses a unique surface protein called tRip, involved in the import of exogenous tRNAs into the parasite. Comparative proteomic analysis of the blood stage of wild-type and tRip-KO variant of P. berghei parasites revealed that down-regulated proteins in the mutant parasite are distinguished by a bias in their asparagine content. We therefore propose a model in which a dynamic import of host tRNAAsn allows the synthesis of asparagine-rich regulatory proteins that efficiently and selectively control the parasite infectivity. These results suggest a novel mechanism of translational control where import of host tRNAs emerge as critical regulator of gene expression in the Plasmodium developmental cycle and pathogenesis.\n\nSignificance StatementtRip is a surface protein involved in the import of exogenous tRNAs into the malaria parasite, Plasmodium. To better understand tRNA import and protein synthesis in Plasmodium, the proteomes of wild-type and tRip-KO parasites were compared. Most of the proteins deregulated in the tRip-KO parasite were under expressed compared to the wild-type. Asparagine usage was greatly increased in the proteins that were down-regulated in the tRip-KO, suggesting that the mutated parasite is impaired in inserting asparagine into proteins. Moreover, the presence of host tRNAs inside the blood stage parasite and the possibility of charging these imported tRNAs with endogenous aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, led us to propose that, imported host tRNAs participate in parasite protein synthesis and control its development.",

    "abstract": "Human HELicase, Lymphoid Specific (HELLS), and plant homolog Deficient in DNA Methylation 1 (DDM1), belong to a distinct class of chromatin remodelers that play important roles in DNA repair, transcription, and maintenance of DNA methylation in heterochromatin. HELLS also promotes the growth of hard-to-treat cancers including glioblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, we identify an auto-inhibitory HELLS N-terminal coiled-coil, unravelling a long-standing question of HELLS inactivity in vitro. Using cryo-EM, we determine the 3.5 [A] structure of an active DDM1-HELLS chimera in complex with a nucleosome. The structure reveals that a HELLS-specific insertion in the ATPase lobe 2 interacts with the nucleosome acidic patch to enhance chromatin remodeling. At the C-terminus, we resolve a unique motif, and disease hot spot, that binds and stabilizes the ATPase motor of the HELLS family of remodelers. Finally, we provide mechanistic insights for how post-translational modifications in the motor domain and midloop could modulate HELLS activity to regulate cancer stem cell state.",

Early evidences demonstrated the guanosine addition and 2'-O-ribose methylation spatiotemporally correlated with transcription machinery at the early stage of transcription. Here, we determined cryo-EM structures of PEC (paused elongation complex)-RNGTT (RNA guanylyltransferase and 5' phosphatase) and PEC-RNGTT-CMTR1 (cap-specific mRNA (nucleoside-2'-O-)-methyltransferase). The structures show that RNGTT docks to the root of Pol II stalk through its OB fold. Within RNGTT, the OB fold binds N-terminal of triphosphatase domain and facilitates positioning its catalytic cavity facing towards the RNA exit tunnel. RNGTT dephosphorylates and guanylates PEC-bound RNAs of 17nt, 19nt, 20nt, but not 22nt, in length. CMTR1 arrayed with RNGTT on the Pol II surface through distinct interfaces. Our structures unravel that capping enzymes RNGTT and CMTR1 directly docks to paused elongation complex, and shed light on how pre-mRNA capping couples with Pol II at the specific transcription stage.",

    "abstract": "Understanding and remembering the complex experiences of everyday life is only possible because we can draw on prior knowledge about how events in our world unfold over time. How does the brain construct event representations using our library of schematic scripts, and what are the behavioral and neural consequences of activating a specific script during perception? We developed a novel set of 16 stories, each of which combines one of four location-relevant event scripts (restaurant, airport, grocery store, lecture hall) with one of four socially-relevant event scripts (breakup, proposal, business deal, meet cute). Participants in an fMRI study and a separate online study listened to these stories after being primed to attend to one of the two scripts or without priming. Responses in angular gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and subregions of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were driven by both location and social script information, showing that these regions can track schematic sequences from multiple domains. Comparing priming conditions, we found that activating a location-related event script shifted the timing of subjective event boundaries to align with script-relevant changes in the narratives. This behavioral shift was mirrored by shifts in the timing of neural responses, with mPFC event boundaries (identified using a Hidden Markov Model) aligning to location-relevant rather than socially-relevant boundaries when participants were location primed. Our findings demonstrate that neural event dynamics are actively modulated by top-down goals, and provide new insight into how narrative event representations are constructed through the activation of temporally-structured prior knowledge.",

    "abstract": "The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has been implicated in mediating both fear and reward learning. Parvalbumin interneurons (PVs) in the BLA have previously been shown to contribute to BLA oscillatory states integral to fear expression, but whether BLA oscillatory states and PV interneurons also contribute to reward learning is unknown and critical to our understanding of reward processing. Local field potentials in the BLA were collected as animals consumed a sucrose reward, where prominent changes in the beta band (15-30 Hz) emerged with reward experience. Rhythmic optogenetic stimulation of PV interneurons to entrain the BLA network to 20Hz during consumption of one bottle during a two-bottle choice test produced a robust bottle preference. Finally, to demonstrate that PV activity is necessary for reward value use, PVs were chemogenetically targeted and inhibited following outcome devaluation, rendering those animals incapable of using updated reward value information to guide their behavior. Taken together, these experiments provide novel information regarding the physiological signatures of reward learning while highlighting the importance of PV interneurons in reward learning. This work builds upon the fields established knowledge of PV involvement in fear expression and provides evidence that PV orchestration of unique BLA network states is involved in both learning types.",

    "abstract": "Neocortical spiking dynamics control aspects of behavior, yet how these dynamics emerge during motor learning remains elusive. Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is likely a key mechanism, as it reconfigures network architectures that govern neural dynamics. Here, we examined how the mouse premotor cortex acquires its well-characterized neural dynamics that control movement timing, specifically lick timing. To probe the role of synaptic plasticity, we have genetically manipulated proteins essential for major forms of synaptic plasticity, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and Cofilin, in a region and cell-type-specific manner. Transient inactivation of CaMKII in the premotor cortex blocked learning of new lick timing without affecting the execution of learned action or ongoing spiking activity. Furthermore, among the major glutamatergic neurons in the premotor cortex, CaMKII and Cofilin activity in pyramidal tract (PT) neurons, but not intratelencephalic (IT) neurons, is necessary for learning. High-density electrophysiology in the premotor cortex uncovered that neural dynamics anticipating licks are progressively shaped during learning, which explains the change in lick timing. Such reconfiguration in behaviorally relevant dynamics is impeded by CaMKII manipulation in PT neurons. Altogether, the activity of plasticity-related proteins in PT neurons plays a central role in sculpting neocortical dynamics to learn new behavior.",

    "abstract": "In most vertebrates, adult neural stem cells (NSCs) continuously give rise to neurons in discrete brain regions. A critical process for maintaining NSC pools over long periods of time in the adult brain is NSC quiescence, a reversible and tightly regulated state of cell cycle arrest. Recently, lysosomes were identified to regulate the NSC quiescence-proliferation balance. However, it remains controversial whether lysosomal activity promotes NSC proliferation or quiescence, and a finer influence of lysosomal activity on NSC quiescence duration or depth remains unexplored. Using RNA-sequencing and pharmacological manipulations, we show that lysosomes are necessary for NSC quiescence maintenance. Additionally, we reveal that expression of psap, encoding the lysosomal regulator Prosaposin, is enriched in quiescent NSCs (qNSCs) that reside upstream in the NSC lineage and display a deep/long quiescence phase in the adult zebrafish telencephalon. We show that shRNA-mediated psap knock-down increases the proportion of activated NSCs (aNSCs) as well as NSCs that reside in shallower quiescence states (signed by ascl1a and deltaA expression). Collectively, our results identify the lysosomal protein Psap as a (direct or indirect) quiescence regulator and unfold the interplay between lysosomal function and NSC quiescence heterogeneities.",

    "abstract": "Intronic polyadenylation (IPA) leads to the production of transcript isoforms with alternative last exons in thousands of mammalian genes. Widespread regulation of IPA isoforms was observed during oncogenic transformation and in tumours versus healthy tissues, and several IPA isoforms were involved in oncogenesis. However, little is known about the potential involvement of IPA in tumour progression, such as cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis, and in resistance to anticancer therapies. Here, we show that an IPA isoform of MET (short MET) whose production is inhibited by U1 snRNP (U1), an essential ribonucleoprotein complex that recognizes the 5 exon-intron junction of pre-mRNA, is associated with better prognosis in breast cancer. Induction of the short MET isoform, using a steric-blocking antisense oligonucleotide targeting the U1 binding site in the vicinity of the short MET alternative polyadenylation site, antagonizes cell invasiveness. U1 blockade with an antisense oligonucleotide targeting the U1 snRNA also decreases breast cancer cell invasiveness, in both human and mouse cancer cell models, and this effect involves IPA induction in MET and several genes belonging to the RAS/RAF/MAPK signalling pathway. Finally, short MET relieves melanoma cell resistance to MAPK cascade-targeted therapy in vitro and in vivo. IPA isoform levels of MET and a few other genes (mTOR, EGFR and CTNNA1) help predict such resistance in patients. Altogether, our findings provide evidence for a role of IPA in both cancer cell invasiveness and resistance to therapy. This suggests that IPA isoforms can be exploited as biomarkers and therapeutic targets to combat tumour progression.",

We show that the cryptophyte Hemiselmis andersenii expresses an energetically complex antenna comprising three distinct spectrotypes of phycobiliprotein with different quaternary structures arising from a diverse  subunit family. The bulk of the antenna consists of open quaternary form phycobiliproteins acting as primary photon acceptors, supplemented by novel open-braced forms. The final components are closed forms with a long wavelength spectral feature due to substitution of a single chromophore. We propose that the macromolecular organization of the cryptophyte antennas consists of bulk open and open-braced forms that transfer excitations to photosystems via this bridging closed form phycobiliprotein.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryAlgae generate a rainbow of antenna proteins by combining a conserved subunit with different members of a multigene family.",

    "abstract": "Using the voice to produce sound is a widespread form of communication and plays an important role in contexts as diverse as parent-offspring interactions and courtship. Variation in the tempo and mode of vocal signal evolution has been studied in a phylogenetic context within orders or classes, but understanding vocal signal evolution ultimately requires comparison across all major lineages involved. Here we used comparative analyses to investigate the evolution of dominant frequency (i.e., the frequency with the highest energy content) and its association with body weight across 873 species of mammals, birds and frogs. In agreement with previous studies, we found that the negative allometric relationship between body weight and vocal frequency is a general feature of vocal systems. In addition, we found mammals to consistently vocalize at higher frequencies, and evolved their vocalizations at around 6-fold faster rates than those of birds and frogs. Although all three groups strongly rely on vocal communication, our findings show that only mammals have extensively explored the spectral acoustic space. We argue that such high vocal diversity of mammals is made possible by their unique hearing system, which evolved in the context of a small, parental-caring, nocturnal and insectivore ancestor, and has allowed them to detect, and therefore to evolve, a richer array of frequencies than other tetrapods.",

    "abstract": "Red fluorescent protein (RFP) derived indicators are popular due to advantages such as increased imaging depth and reduced autofluorescence and cytotoxicity. However, most RFP-based indicators have low brightness and are susceptible to blue-light-induced photoactivation. In this study, we aimed to overcome the limitations of existing red fluorescent indicators. We utilized mScarlet-I, a highly bright and robust monomeric RFP, to develop a circularly permuted variant called cpmScarlet. We further engineered cpmScarlet into a novel red fluorescent indicator specifically for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a crucial reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in redox signaling and oxidative stress. The resultant indicator, SHRIMP (mScarlet-derived H2O2 Redox Indicator with Minimal Photoactivation), exhibited excitation and emission peaks at [~]570 and 595 nm, respectively, and demonstrated a maximum five-fold fluorescence turn-off response to H2O2. Importantly, SHRIMP was not susceptible to blue-light-induced photoactivation and showed high brightness both in its purified protein form and when expressed in mammalian cells. We successfully employed SHRIMP to visualize H2O2 dynamics in mammalian cells with exogenously added H2O2 and in activated macrophages. Additionally, we demonstrated its utility for multiparameter imaging by co-expressing SHRIMP with GCaMP6m, a green fluorescent calcium indicator, enabling simultaneous monitoring of H2O2 and calcium dynamics in mammalian cells in response to thapsigargin (TG) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Furthermore, we expressed SHRIMP in isolated primary mouse islet tissue, and SHRIMP exhibited excellent brightness and capability for effective detection of H2O2 production during streptozotocin (STZ)-induced {beta}-cell damage. This study successfully transformed mScarlet-I, a bright and robust monomeric RFP, into a circularly permuted variant (cpmScarlet) and developed the first cpmScarlet-based genetically encoded fluorescent indicator called SHRIMP. SHRIMP exhibits high brightness and insensitivity to photoactivation and is a valuable tool for real-time monitoring of H2O2 dynamics in various biological systems. Further research may yield an expanded family of cpmScarlet-based red fluorescent indicators with enhanced photophysical properties.",

Here, we examined this hypothesis in a 3D in vitro model system by growing primary human lung fibroblasts in ECM-derived hydrogels from non-fibrotic (control) or IPF lung tissue. Culture of fibroblasts in fibrotic hydrogels did not trigger a change in the overall amount of collagen or glycosaminoglycans but did cause a drastic change in fiber organization compared to culture in control hydrogels. Mechanical properties of fibrotic hydrogels were modified by fibroblasts while control hydrogels were not. These results illustrate how the 3D microenvironment plays a crucial role in directing cells to exhibit pro-fibrotic responses by providing biochemical and/or biomechanical cues.",

    "abstract": "Ebola virus (EBOV) protein VP40 can assemble and bud in the form of virus-like particles (VLPs) when expressed in the absence of other EBOV proteins in mammalian cells. When nucleoprotein (NP) is co-expressed, VLPs will contain inclusion-body (IB) cores, and VLP production can be increased. However, the mechanism of how NP impacts VLP production remains unclear. Here, we use a computational approach to study NP-VP40 interactions. We find that NP may enhance VLP production through stabilizing VP40 filaments and accelerating the VLP budding step. Also, both the relative timing and amount of NP expression compared to VP40 are important for the effective production of IB-containing VLPs. We further find that there exists an optimum NP/VP40 expression ratio, and that earlier expression of NP compared to VP40 will produce IB-containing VLPs more efficiently. We conclude that disrupting the relative timing and amount of NP and VP40 expression could provide new avenues to treat EBOV infection.

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in biology is how a limited number of genes combinatorially govern cellular responses to environmental changes. While the prevailing hypothesis is that relationships between genes, processes, and ontologies could be plastic to achieve this adaptability, quantitatively comparing human gene functional connections between specific environmental conditions at scale is very challenging. Therefore, it remains unclear whether and how human genetic interaction networks are rewired in response to changing environmental conditions. Here, we developed a framework for mapping context-specific genetic interactions, enabling us to measure the plasticity of human genetic architecture upon environmental challenge for [~]250,000 interactions, using cell cycle interruption, genotoxic perturbation, and nutrient deprivation as archetypes. We discover large-scale rewiring of human gene relationships across conditions, highlighted by dramatic shifts in the functional connections of epigenetic regulators (TIP60), cell cycle regulators (PP2A), and glycolysis metabolism. Our study demonstrates that upon environmental perturbation, intra-complex genetic rewiring is rare while inter-complex rewiring is common, suggesting a modular and flexible evolutionary genetic strategy that allows a limited number of human genes to enable adaptation to a large number of environmental conditions.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryFive human genetic interaction maps reveal how the landscape of genes functional relationships is rewired as cells experience environmental stress to DNA integrity, cell cycle regulation, and metabolism.",

    "abstract": "It is generally believed that humans are the only species that values life. However, it is not well understood whether animals have a nature that values life. In this study, we attempted to determine whether male Wistar rats have this nature. Normally-reared rats did not show lifesaving-like actions towards anesthesia-induced comatose rats, although they seemed to distinguish life from death. Considering the possibility that different rearing conditions may foster a life-valuing nature, male Wistar rat pups were reared in several ways: normal rearing, loving rearing (LR; rats reared as if they were cute pets), rearing in an enriched environment, reared with gentle stroking of the back, and normal rearing of offspring of rats raised under LR conditions. When placed in an anxiety-producing environment, only LR rats escaped into the hands of the person who reared them, indicating attachment. Only the LR rats displayed lifesaving-like actions towards unknown comatose rats or drowning pups. LR rats also stopped attacks by biting ICR mice that were attacking C57BL/6 mice. Thus, rearing in an affectionate environment may foster a life-valuing nature, even in rats, suggesting that the valuing of life may be neither innate nor human-specific.",
