    "abstract": "In recent years, cyclic peptides have gained growing traction as a therapeutic modality owing to their diverse biological activities. Understanding the structures of these cyclic peptides and their complexes can provide valuable insights. However, experimental observation needs much time and money, and there still are many limitations to CADD methods. As for DL-based models, the scarcity of training data poses a formidable challenge in predicting cyclic peptides and their complexes. In this work, we present \"High-fold,\" an AlphaFold-based algorithm that addresses this issue. By incorporating pertinent information about head-to-tailed circular and disulfide bridge structures, Highfold reaches the best performance in comparison to other various approaches. This model enables accurate prediction of cyclic peptides and their complexes, making a step to-wards resolving its structure-activity research.",

Fats such as olive oil, butter, lamb fat and lard readily adsorb onto IL with soft solid fats contained in lamb fat and lard, showing strong adhesion and more resistance to removal on rinsing in a water stream. Dishwashing detergents containing surfactants prevent the adsorption of both liquid and solid fats to the lettuce leaf surface, unless at very low concentrations, highlighting their significant influence on surface properties. Based on the adhesion of fats to the IL leaf surface, it is proposed the consumption of IL could reduce acute gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In diets containing fat, the adhesion to IL reduces the amount of fat available to adhere to the mucus surface of the stomach barrier lining, protecting the lining and reducing access by trigger foods to underlying surfaces that could potentially initiate GER.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=44 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/554975v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (14K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a1f01forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9bb02borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14afc4aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f9923a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Iceberg lettuce leaves have approximately twice the surface area of the stomach for a 50g serve and 500cm3 meal volume and due to the waxy surface, can adsorb significant amounts of dietary fat.

We found that UPCs have inherent antitumor properties due to cell-cell competition, and we described their mechanism of action against different tumor cell lines. In vitro time-lapse analysis showed that the UPCs have tumor tropic properties, homing to various tumor-conditioned mediums. Besides, UPCs engineered for the expression of cytotoxic agents (the Tumor Necrosis Factor ligand superfamily member 10 and Herpesvirus-thymidine kinase) significantly increased their antitumor properties against several tumor cell lines and proved to serve as highly effective drug-delivery vehicles. Finally, using a mouse model of human triple-negative breast cancer, we observed a 150-fold decrease in tumor volumes in mice treated with engineered UPCs compared to controls. Collectively, our findings demonstrate for the first time the antitumor properties of the UPCs and form a foundation to continue exploring the new concept of cell-cell competition in progenitor cells to treat different types of cancer.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of misfolded tau protein is a common feature of tauopathies. Cells employ diverse mechanisms to eliminate misfolded tau with different conformations, contributing to the varied clinical and pathological manifestations of tauopathies. This study focuses on the clearance of seeded tau aggregates following the induction of biosensor cells with R2 and R3 fibrils that exhibit distinct aggregation kinetics and seeding potencies. Our hypothesis is that the dissimilarity in time-dependent intracellular seeding induced by R2 and R3 fibrils underlies the variation in autophagy failure. These discrepancies may account for the heterogeneity of pathology and disease progression between 3R and 4R tauopathies, given the absence of R2 in 3R tau isoforms. In R2-induced cells, alterations in p62 and LC3II/I levels, indicative of proteotoxic stress and autophagy failure, occur sooner than in R3-induced cells. Conversely, LAMP1 levels remained unaffected, suggesting a failure in the fusion of aggregate-containing autophagosomes with lysosomes. This autophagic failure may increase seed-dependent intracellular aggregation in induced cells. Consequently, we assessed the impact of autophagy inducers on the clearance of intracellular tau aggregates in induced cells. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) demonstrated the highest efficacy in inducing autophagy and reducing p62 levels, decreasing seeding and clearing aggregates. Overall, this study elucidates the differential effects of prion-like R2 and R3 strains on autophagy and highlights how compounds like EGCG can selectively reduce tau aggregation to treat specific tauopathies. We provide insights into the distinct mechanisms of autophagy failure and autophagy clearance of intracellular aggregates in cells induced with R2 and R3 fibrils.",

We then measured reaction time as an indicator of planning effort and found that stimulation could significantly alter answer latency. Sites displaying stimulation-induced slowed behavior were primarily located in caudal middle and inferior frontal gyri, areas that exhibited preparatory-related activity during conversational turn-taking in previous intracranial recordings.

    "abstract": "Depression is associated with a cognitive bias towards negative information and away from positive information. This biased emotion processing may underlie core depression symptoms, including persistent feelings of sadness or low mood and a reduced capacity to experience pleasure. The neural mechanisms responsible for this biased emotion processing remain unknown. Here, we had a unique opportunity to record stereotactic electroencephalography (sEEG) signals in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex (PFC) from 5 treatment-resistant depression (TRD) patients and 12 epilepsy patients (as control) while they participated in an affective bias task in which happy and sad faces were rated. First, compared with the control group, patients with TRD showed increased amygdala responses to sad faces in the early stage (around 300 ms) and decreased amygdala responses to happy faces in the late stage (around 600 ms) following the onset of faces. Further, during the late stage of happy face processing, alpha-band activity in PFC as well as alpha-phase locking between the amygdala and PFC were significantly greater in TRD patients compared to the controls. Second, after deep brain stimulation (DBS) delivered to bilateral subcallosal cingulate (SCC) and ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS), atypical amygdala and PFC processing of happy faces in TRD patients remitted toward the normative pattern. The increased amygdala activation during the early stage of sad face processing suggests an overactive bottom-up processing system in TRD. Meanwhile, the reduced amygdala response during the late stage of happy face processing could be attributed to inhibition by PFC through alpha-band oscillation, which can be released by DBS in SCC and VC/VS.",

After sensing visceral inputs, the NTS relays information to efferent pathways to modulate peripheral viscera. However, the neural computation mechanism underlying how the NTS processes viscerosensory input remains unknown. Here, we show the computational principles embedded inside the NTS of rats, producing haemodynamic modulation in concert. Our findings demonstrate that the collective dynamics leveraging from neuronal population within the NTS neural circuit encode input-driven haemodynamics. The NTS exhibits the neural trajectory, the dynamical trace of neural states, which is confined to low-dimensional latent space and may represent haemodynamic perturbations. Surprisingly, by normalizing neural trajectory of rats, we found the across-rat common rules for the viscerosensory-information processing by the NTS. Furthermore, the common rules allowed to identify inter-subject variable haemodynamics by quantifying the computational mechanisms in neuro-haemodynamic axis. Our findings provide pioneering insights into understanding the neural computation involved in regulation of visceral functions by the autonomic nervous system.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated neural activity related to the assimilation effect in the perception of vibrotactile stimuli. The assimilation effect refers to a tactile perceptual bias in which the perception of the vibrotactile frequency on one finger is biased towards a distracting vibrotactile stimulus targeting other types of mechanoreceptors on the different finger. The assimilation effect occurs not only between fingers on the same hand (in-hand) but also between fingers on different hands (across-hand). These behavioral aspects of the assimilation effect lead to an assumption that neural processes related to the assimilation effect would involve the integration of different tactile information mediated by the somatosensory cortex. We addressed this hypothesis by investigating brain responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to vibrotactile stimuli that induced assimilation effect under in-hand and across-hand conditions. We first observed that the vibrotactile stimuli presented in this study activated primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices. Yet, neural responses in these regions did not show correlations with individual assimilation effects, indicating that neural processing of vibrotactile signals in S1 and S2 would not be directly linked to the assimilation effect. Instead, we found that connectivity between S1 and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was correlated with individual in-hand assimilation effects and that connectivity between S2 and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) was correlated with individual across-hand assimilation effects. These results suggest that the assimilation effect may be related to tactile information integration via functional connections between the somatosensory cortex and higher-order brain regions.\n\nSignificant StatementThis study found that the vibrotactile assimilation effect is influenced by the functional connections between the somatosensory cortex and higher-order brain regions, with distinct neural correlates observed between conditions of stimuli applied across fingers or across hands. Individual differences in the degree of the assimilation effect were related to connectivity between somatosensory regions and mPFC/IPL. These results suggest that integrating different types of tactile information received from different locations would engage cortical networking of the somatosensory cortex with frontal and parietal regions.",

    "abstract": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a key role in learning, mood and decision making, including in how individuals respond to threats1-6. mPFC undergoes a uniquely protracted development, with changes in synapse density, cortical thickness, long-range connectivity, and neuronal encoding properties continuing into early adulthood7-21. Models suggest that before adulthood, the slow-developing mPFC cannot adequately regulate activity in faster-developing subcortical centers22,23. They propose that during development, the enhanced influence of subcortical systems underlies distinctive behavioural strategies of juveniles and adolescents and that increasing mPFC control over subcortical structures eventually allows adult behaviours to emerge. Yet it has remained unclear how a progressive strengthening of top-down control can lead to nonlinear changes in behaviour as individuals mature24,25. To address this discrepancy, here we monitored and manipulated activity in the developing brain as animals responded to threats, establishing direct causal links between frontolimbic circuit activity and the behavioural strategies of juvenile, adolescent and adult mice. Rather than a linear strengthening of mPFC synaptic connectivity progressively regulating behaviour, we uncovered multiple developmental switches in the behavioural roles of mPFC circuits targeting the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). We show these changes are accompanied by axonal pruning coinciding with functional strengthening of synaptic connectivity in the mPFC-BLA and mPFC-NAc pathways, which mature at different rates. Our results reveal how developing mPFC circuits pass through distinct architectures that may make them optimally adapted to the demands of age-specific challenges.",

How does expectation shape the activity of cortical neurons to allow for improved perceptual discrimination of visual inputs? We recorded from populations of neurons in visual cortical area V4 while monkeys performed a natural image change detection task under different expectation conditions. We found that higher expectation led to an improvement in the ability to detect a change in an image. This improvement was associated with decreased neural responses to the image, providing evidence that a reduction in activity can improve stimulus encoding. The decrease in response could not be fully explained by short-timescale adaptation, suggesting partially separate mechanisms of adaptation and expectation. Additionally, higher expectation was associated with decreased trial-to-trial shared variability, indicating that a reduction in variability is a key means by which expectation influences perception.

The tumorigenicity of unmodified parental cells (MC38 PT) and MC38 H-2Kd was tested in vivo by subcutaneous injection into the flank of wild-type (WT) and programmed death-1 (PD-1) knockout (KO) mice in a C57BL/6 (H-2b) genetic background. MC38 PT cells readily formed tumors and grew progressively in both WT and PD-1 KO mice. The speed of MC38 PT tumor growth was slower in PD-1 KO mice than in WT mice. In contrast, MC38 H-2Kd cells showed full sensitivity to rejection by the immune system in both naive WT and PD-1 KO mice, indicated by spontaneous tumor regression. Next, we sought to determine the extent to which H-2Kd-overexpressing tumors could protect the mice against unmodified cancers. PD-1 KO mice were first sensitized with highly immunogenic MC38 H-2Kd cells and then challenged with weakly immunogenic MC38 PT cells. Intriguingly, all PD-1 KO mice gained immunity against the aggressive MC38 tumor and became tumor-free. Sensitizing PD-1 KO mice with growth-arrested (by the pre-treatment with mitomycin C, MMC) and the debris of MC38 H-2Kd tumors also provided full protection against the growth of secondary MC38 PT tumors. Most notably, sensitization with the debris of MC38 H-2Kd cells provided the long-term immunological memory against MC38 PT carcinoma cells. This finding implies that MC38 H-2Kd cells retain highly efficient and durable immunogenicity.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocyte transplantation for genetic liver diseases has several potential advantages over gene therapy. However, low efficiency of cell engraftment has limited its clinical implementation. This problem could be overcome by selectively expanding transplanted donor cells until they replace enough of the liver mass to achieve therapeutic benefit. We previously described a gene therapy method to selectively expand hepatocytes deficient in cytochrome p450 reductase (Cypor) using acetaminophen (APAP). Because Cypor is required for the transformation of APAP to a hepatotoxic metabolite, Cypor deficient cells are protected from toxicity and are able to expand following APAP-induced liver injury. Here, we apply this selection system to correct a mouse model of phenylketonuria (PKU) by cell transplantation. Hepatocytes from a wildtype donor animal were edited in vitro to create Cypor deficiency and then transplanted into PKU animals. Following selection with APAP, blood phenylalanine concentrations were fully normalized and remained stable following APAP withdrawal. Cypor-deficient hepatocytes expanded from <1% to [~]14% in corrected animals, and they showed no abnormalities in blood chemistries, liver histology, or drug metabolism. We conclude that APAP-mediated selection of transplanted hepatocytes is a potential therapeutic for PKU with long-term efficacy and a favorable safety profile.",

    "abstract": "Achondroplasia (ACH, achondroplastic dwarfism) represents the most common form of skeletal dysplasia, occurring in c. 4 out of every 100,000 births. This study presents a computer-based facial approximation of the skull of a male individual suffering from ACH, who died at 30-45 years of age and was buried in ekno, Poland between the 9th and 11th centuries AD. For the approximation procedure, soft tissue data from CT scans and ultrasonic measurements performed on living individuals were used. Additionally, the anatomical deformation technique was applied to arrive at the most reliable reconstruction of the dwarfs appearance. To our knowledge, this is the first recreation of a person with achondroplasia, and one of the few showing a head of an individual suffering from a hereditary disease, with dimensions and shape differing from the population average values.\n\nHighlights- Forensic facial approximation of an achondroplastic dwarf from 9th-11th century AD has been performed as the first in the world\n- The applied procedure included CT of a virtual donor\n- Anatomical deformation technique allowed to extract the endocast, revealing a large volume of the endocranium\n- Few measurements applied to the facial skeleton proved successful in identification of a person suffering from achondroplasia",

    "abstract": "An accurate genome at the chromosome level is the key to unraveling the mysteries of gene function and unlocking the mechanisms of disease. Irrespective of the sequencing methodology adopted, Hi-C aided scaffolding serves as a principal avenue for generating genome assemblies at the chromosomal level. However, the results of such scaffolding are often flawed and require extensive manual refinement. In this paper, we introduce AutoHiC, an innovative deep learning-based tool designed to identify and rectify genome assembly errors. Diverging from conventional approaches, AutoHiC harnesses the power of high-dimensional Hi-C data to enhance genome continuity and accuracy through a fully automated workflow and iterative error correction mechanism. AutoHiC was trained on Hi-C data from more than 300 species (approximately five hundred thousand interaction maps) in DNA Zoo and NCBI. Its confusion matrix results show that the average error detection accuracy is over 90%, and the area under the precision-recall curve is close to 1, making it a powerful error detection capability. The benchmarking results demonstrate AutoHiCs ability to substantially enhance genome continuity and significantly reduce error rates, providing a more reliable foundation for genomics research. Furthermore, AutoHiC generates comprehensive result reports, offering users insights into the assembly process and outcomes. In summary, AutoHiC represents a breakthrough in automated error detection and correction for genome assembly, effectively promoting more accurate and comprehensive genome assemblies.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome is known to be a driver of age-related health decline. Various studies have shone light on the role of the gut microbiome as a marker as well as modulator of aging processes. However, the mechanisms by which the microbiome affects aging are still unclear. We have developed a Microbiome Metabolite Aging (MMA) fusion network by building upon a metabolic interaction network of gut microbiota to develop associations with the hallmarks of aging. The MMA, consisting of 238 metabolite-aging hallmark interactions serves as a tool to investigate the mammalian (and in particular human) gut microbiome as an effector of aging at a systems-level. The network further identifies 249 microbes that unequivocally affect the hallmarks of aging. The results highlight how the underlying biology of microbial metabolite mediated interactions, in conjunction with the topological properties at a network level, differentially regulate the aging hallmarks. This detailed microbial and metabolite association to the hallmarks of aging provides a foundational model which is envisaged to be instrumental in advancing our knowledge of the physiology of aging, and for the development of novel therapeutic tools.",

    "abstract": "In lactating mothers, the high calcium (Ca2+) demand for milk production triggers significant bone resorption. While estrogen would normally counteract excessive bone loss and maintain sufficient bone formation during this postpartum period, this sex steroid drops precipitously after giving birth. Here, we report that brain-derived CCN3 (Cellular Communication Network factor 3) secreted from KISS1 neurons of the arcuate nucleus (ARCKISS1) fills this void and functions as a potent osteoanabolic factor to promote bone mass in lactating females. Using parabiosis and bone transplant methods, we first established that a humoral factor accounts for the female-specific, high bone mass previously observed by our group after deleting estrogen receptor alpha (ER) from ARCKISS1 neurons1. This exceptional bone phenotype in mutant females can be traced back to skeletal stem cells (SSCs), as reflected by their increased frequency and osteochondrogenic potential. Based on multiple assays, CCN3 emerged as the most promising secreted pro-osteogenic factor from ARCKISS1 neurons, acting on mouse and human SSCs at low subnanomolar concentrations independent of age or sex. That brain-derived CCN3 promotes bone formation was further confirmed by in vivo gain- and loss-of-function studies. Notably, a transient rise in CCN3 appears in ARCKISS1 neurons in estrogen-depleted lactating females coincident with increased bone remodeling and high calcium demand. Our findings establish CCN3 as a potentially new therapeutic osteoanabolic hormone that defines a novel female-specific brain-bone axis for ensuring mammalian species survival.",

    "abstract": "Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the most abundant antibody (Ab) in human mucosal compartments including the respiratory tract, with the secretory form of IgA (sIgA) being dominant and uniquely stable in these environments. sIgA is naturally found in human milk, which could be considered a global resource for this biologic, justifying the development of human milk sIgA as a dedicated airway therapeutic for respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, methods were therefore developed to efficiently extract human milk sIgA from donors who were either immunologically naive to SARS-CoV-2 (pooled as a control IgA) or had recovered from a PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection that elicited high-titer anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike sIgA Abs in their milk (pooled together to make LCTG-002). Mass spectrometry determined that proteins with a relative abundance of 1.0% or greater were all associated with sIgA. None of the proteins exhibited statistically significant differences between batches. Western blot demonstrated all batches consisted predominantly of sIgA. Compared to control IgA, LCTG-002 demonstrated significantly higher binding to Spike, and was also capable of blocking the Spike - ACE2 interaction in vitro with 6.3x greater potency compared to control IgA (58% inhibition at [~]240ug/mL). LCTG-002 was then tested in vivo for its capacity to reduce viral burden in the lungs of K18+hACE2 transgenic mice inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. LCTG-002 was demonstrated to significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 titers in the lungs compared to control IgA when administered at either 250ug/day or 1 mg/day, as measured by TCID50, plaque forming units (PFU), and qRT-PCR, with a maximum reduction of 4.9 logs. This innovative study demonstrates that LCTG-002 is highly pure, efficacious, and well tolerated in vivo, supporting further development of milk-derived, polyclonal sIgA therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other mucosal infections.",

The SOS response is an inducible DNA damage repair system that plays an indispensable role in bacterial adaptation and pathogenesis. Here we report a discovery of the previously uncharacterized protein Lmo0946 as an SOS response interfering factor (Sif) in the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. Functional genetic studies demonstrated that sif is indespensible for normal growth of L. monocytogenes in stress-free as well as multi-stress conditions, and sif contributes to susceptibility to {beta}-lactam antibiotics, biofilm formation and virulence. Absence of Sif promoted the SOS response and elevated expression of mobilome genes accompanied by mobilization of the A118 prophage and ICELm-1 mobile genetic elements (MGEs). These changes were found to be associated with decreased expression of general stress response genes from the {sigma}B regulon as well as virulence genes, including the PrfA regulon. Together, this study uncovers an unexpected role of a previously uncharacterized factor, Sif, as an inhibitor of the SOS response in L. monocytogenes.\n\nSUMMARYThis study uncovers an unexpected role of a previously uncharacterized factor, Sif, as an inhibitor of the SOS response in L. monocytogenes.",

    "abstract": "Virus-mediated membrane fusion involves conformational changes of the viral fusion protein to fuse the opposing viral and host lipid bilayers. Unlike all other known viruses that contain a single fusion protein, poxviruses harbor a multimeric protein complex of 11 subunits, termed the entry fusion complex (EFC), to mediate fusion with host membranes. Yet, how the poxviral EFC mediates membrane fusion remains enigmatic. To establish the mechanism of EFC-triggered membrane fusion, we are deciphering the structure and function of individual EFC components. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the H2 ectodomain by X-ray diffraction, revealing a folded conformation comprising a central five-stranded {beta}-sheet and three cladding -helices. We reconstructed the full-length H2 by in silico prediction, revealing that the N-terminal region (aa 51-90) of H2 protein may fold as a long helix connecting the ectodomain and transmembrane region. Using alanine-mutagenesis screening in a transient complementation system, coimmunoprecipitation, isothermal titration calorimetry and MV-triggered membrane fusion assays, we concluded that the surface of the ectodomain of H2 protein, including two loop regions, 170LGYSG174 and 125RRGTGDAW132, constitutes a broad A28-binding region. Moreover, although not involved in A28 binding, the N-terminal helical region approximal to the transmembrane part, encompassing 64RIK66, 72W, and 83ESDRGR88, is also crucial for viral EFC formation and MV infectivity.",

    "abstract": "Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) play key roles in the control of viral replication and dissemination. Understanding this dynamic relationship between the pathogen and host is critical to our understanding of viral life-cycles and development of potential novel anti-viral strategies. Traditionally, plasmid based exogenous prompter driven expression of ISGs has been used to investigate anti-viral ISG function, however there are deficiencies in this approach. To overcome this, we investigated the utility of CRISPR activation (CRISPRa), which allows for targeted transcriptional activation of a gene from its endogenous promoter. Using the CRISPRa-SAM system to induce targeted expression of a panel of anti-viral ISGs we showed robust induction of mRNA and protein expression. We then employed our CRISPRa-SAM ISG panel in several antiviral screen formats to test for the ability of ISGs to prevent viral induced cytopathic cell death (CPE) and replication of Dengue Virus (DENV), Zika Virus (ZIKV), West Nile Virus Kunjin (WNVKUNV), Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) and Human Coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). Our CRISPRa approach confirmed the anti-viral activity of ISGs like IFI6, IFN{beta} and IFN{lambda}2 that prevented viral induced CPE, which was supported by high-content immunofluorescence imaging analysis. This work highlights CRISPRa as a rapid, agile, and powerful methodology to identify and characterise ISGs and viral restriction factors.",

    "abstract": "Oral streptococci are the pioneer colonizer and structural architect of the complex oral biofilm. Disruption of this architectural framework causes oral dysbiosis associated with various clinical conditions, including dental caries, gingivitis, and oral cancer. Among the genus Streptococcus, S. anginosus is associated with esophageal, gastric, and pharyngeal cancer tissues, while S. mitis is correlated with oral cancer. However, no study has investigated mechanistic links between these Streptococcus species and cancer-related inflammatory responses. To explore the underlying involvement of S. anginosus and S. mitis in inflammation-associated cancer development, we investigated the innate immune response elicited by S. anginosus versus S. mitis using the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line. Compared to untreated or S. mitis infected macrophages, S. anginosus infected macrophages exhibited a robust proinflammatory response characterized by significantly increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and mediators, including TNF, IL-6, IL-1{beta}, NOS2, and COX2, accompanied by enhanced NF-{kappa}B activation. Mitostress analysis revealed an increased extracellular acidification rate in macrophages infected with S. anginosus compared to S. mitis. Further, macrophages infected with S. anginosus for 6h displayed upregulated aconitate decarboxylase, which catalyzes itaconate production. In contrast, no significant alterations were observed in succinate dehydrogenase that converts succinate to fumarate. At 24h, S. anginosus induced significant shifts in succinate and itaconate, emphasizing a unique macrophage metabolic profile, and an augmented inflammatory response in response to S. anginosus. This study underscores the capacity of S. anginosus to elicit a robust proinflammatory response in macrophages and opens new avenues of secretory immune metabolites in response to oral streptococci.\n\nImportanceThe surge in head and neck cancer cases among individuals devoid of typical risk factors such as HPV infection, tobacco and alcohol use sparks an argumentative discussion around the emerging role of oral microbiota as a novel risk factor in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). While substantial research has dissected the gut microbiomes influence on physiology, the oral microbiome, notably oral streptococci, a gatekeeper of systemic health, has been underappreciated in mucosal immunopathogenesis. S. anginosus, a viridans streptococci group, has been linked to abscess formation and an elevated presence in esophageal cancer and OSCC. The current study aims to probe the innate immune response to S. anginosus compared to the early colonizer S. mitis as an initial ride towards understanding the impact of distinct oral Streptococcus species on the host immune response in the progression of OSCC.",

The body plan of the adult is established during pupa stage and larval systems are de-differentiated and reorganized in insects undergoing complete metamorphosis. In ladybird beetles, the limbs amputated in the larval stages are regenerated in the adults. This occurs during pupation. Given that changes in the pupa are akin to embryogenesis, does the lost limbs are redeveloped as a part of metamorphosis or has some pre-patterning initiated prior pupation? To study this we hypothesised that limb regeneration in a holometabolous ladybird beetles, Cheilomenes sexmaculata is the result of the recapitulation of the embryonic gene programs in the pupa. To test this, we exposed the third larval stages of Cheilomenes sexmaculata (Fabricius) to amputation and prior to amputation the tissues on the amputated site was scraped off every 24hrs. It was found that limb regeneration does not occur in the treatment where scrapping was done. Assuming that these epidermal cells correspond to blastema, for limb regeneration in ladybird beetles blastema is essential and does not occur in its absence.",

We use a collection of E. coli C LPS mutants, each of which is resistant to {Phi}X174, and has either a \"rough\" or \"deep-rough\" LPS phenotype. Growth of deep rough mutants is inhibited at subinhibitory chloramphenicol concentrations. In contrast, gentamicin has no major effect on growth. Hypothesis testing shows that treating E. coli C wildtype with {Phi}X174 and chloramphenicol eliminates deep rough mutants, and reduces phage resistance evolution.

However, the dynamics and significance of this regulatory turnover are not well understood. Here we describe the evolutionary history of core histone gene regulation across 400 million years in Saccharomycotina yeasts, revealing diverse lineage-specific solutions to core histone expression. We further characterize the emergence of a novel regulatory mode in the Hanseniaspora genus, which coincided with the loss of one copy of its paralogous core histones genes from its fast-evolving lineage. By analyzing the growth dynamics using live cell imaging of genetically modified Hanseniaspora uvarum, we observed a regulatory decoupling of core histone synthesis from DNA synthesis and propose that this may be adaptive for its rapid cell cycle progression. Overall, our findings imply that the frequent turnover of core histone cis-regulatory mechanisms likely provides distinct adaptive solutions for specific life histories.",

    "abstract": "The precision of gene editing technology is critical to creating safe and effective therapies for treating human disease. While the programmability of CRISPR-Cas systems has allowed for rapid innovation of new gene editing techniques, the off-target activity of these enzymes has hampered clinical development for novel therapeutics. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel CRISPR-Cas12a enzyme from Acinetobacter indicus (AiCas12a). We then engineer the nuclease (termed AiEvo2) for increased specificity, PAM recognition, and efficacy on a variety of human clinical targets. AiEvo2 is highly precise and able to efficiently discriminate between normal and disease-causing alleles in Huntingtons patient derived cells by taking advantage of a single nucleotide polymorphism on the disease-associated allele. AiEvo2 efficiently edits several liver-associated target genes including PCSK9 and TTR when delivered to primary hepatocytes as mRNA encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle. The enzyme also engineers an effective CD19 CAR-T therapy from primary human T cells using multiplexed simultaneous editing and CAR insertion. To further ensure precise editing, we engineered an anti-CRISPR protein (ErAcr) to selectively inhibit off-target gene editing while retaining therapeutic on-target editing. The engineered AiEvo2 nuclease coupled with a novel ErAcr protein represents a new way to control the fidelity of editing and improve the safety and efficacy of gene editing therapies.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing demand for covalent tool compounds and chemical probes to investigate and perturb protein function and dysregulation. The combination of a covalent electrophile with a peptide or protein-based scaffold with an extended binding footprint enables the targeting of shallow protein surfaces, not typically addressable using small molecules. However, to fully exploit the potential of electrophilic proteins or peptides there is a need for versatile approaches to convert native peptide sequences into covalent binders that can target a broad range of residues. Here we report protein-based thio-methacrylate esters - electrophiles with a diverse reactivity profile that can be installed easily on unprotected peptides and proteins via cysteine side chains, and react efficiently and selectively with cysteine and lysine side chains on the target. Guided by computational modeling, we designed and synthesized methacrylate phosphopeptides derived from 14-3-3-binding proteins and demonstrated these peptides irreversibly label 14-3-3{sigma} via either lysine or cysteine residues, depending on the position of the electrophile. Methacrylate peptides targeting a conserved lysine residue exhibited pan-isoform binding of 14-3-3 proteins, and efficiently labeled 14-3-3 proteins in lysates, as well as secreted 14-3-3 extracellularly. The irreversible binding to the predicted target lysines were confirmed by proteomics and X-ray crystallography of the complexes. Finally, we applied this approach to develop protein-based covalent binders. A methacrylate-modified variant of the colicin E9 immunity protein irreversibly bound to the E9 DNAse, resulting in significantly higher thermal stability relative to the non-covalent complex. Our approach offers a simple and versatile route to convert peptides and proteins into potent covalent binders.",

    "abstract": "AimThe biological mechanisms linking sedentary lifestyles and metabolic derangements are incompletely understood. Our animal model mimics sedentary behavior during early life, enabling us to explore the associated chromatin epigenetic and transcriptomic landscapes.\n\nMethodsDrosophila larvae carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in the shibire1 (shi) gene were used. shi homozygous mutant larvae undergo instant arrest of muscle contraction at a restrictive temperature (30{degrees}C), without affecting other systems. Both shi and control (y,w) larvae were held at permissive temperature (18{degrees}C), and transferred to restrictive temperature (30{degrees}C) for six hours. Larvae were then dissected, fixed, and double-labeled with antibodies specific for epigenetic marks of chromatin activation (H3K9ac) and repression (H3K27me3), and their fluorescence signal was quantified. In addition, whole genome analysis of RNA-Pol II binding to DNA in muscle-specific inactive, or control larvae was performed using muscle-specific targeted DamID (TaDa) protocol.\n\nResultsInducing muscle inactivity in shi larvae at 300C yielded a significantly higher ratio between chromatin activation and repression, based upon H3K9ac/H3K27me3 signals (p=0.025), relative to all control groups for which this ratio was comparable (p=0.995). Furthermore, muscle inactivation led to altered Pol II binding to 121 out of 2010 genes (6%). The suppressed protein-coding genes included genes associated with longevity, DNA repair, muscle function, and ubiquitin-dependent proteostasis. In addition, a three-fold enrichment of genes coding for lncRNAs was noted in the muscle-inactive larvae.\n\nConclusionInducing muscle inactivation exerted a multi-level impact upon chromatin, triggering an altered epigenetic balance, as well as downregulation of the transcriptional activity of genes essential for muscle function, carbohydrate metabolism, longevity and others. Extrapolating these findings to humans holds promise for establishing a molecular link between sedentary behavior and metabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "To detect and escape from a looming threat, night-flying insects must rely on other senses than vision alone. Nocturnal mosquitoes have been described to escape looming objects in the dark, but how they achieve this is still unknown. Here, we show how night-active female malaria mosquitoes escape from a rapidly looming object that simulates the defensive action of a blood-host. By combining videography-based automatic tracking with numerical simulations of the attacker-induced airflow, we first show that night-flying mosquitoes use airflow-sensing to detect the danger and trigger their escape. Secondly, by combining these data with mechanistic movement modelling, we unravelled how mosquitoes control their escape manoeuvres: they actively steer away from the danger, and passively travel with the bow-wave produced by the attacker. Our results demonstrate that night-flying mosquitoes escaping from a looming object use the object-induced airflow both to detect the danger, and as fluid medium to move with for avoiding collision. This shows that the escape strategy of flying insects is more complex than previous visually-induces escape flight studies suggest. As mosquitoes are average-sized insects, a combined airflow-induced and visual-induced escape strategy is expected to be common amongst millions of flying insect species. Also, our research helps explain the high escape performance of mosquitoes from counterflow-based odour-baited mosquito traps. It can therefore provide new insights for the development of novel trapping techniques for integrative vector management.",

    "abstract": "Macular degeneration, retinal detachment, and retinitis pigmentosa are eye diseases which cause damage to the photoreceptors and are considered leading causes of vision loss worldwide (National Eye Institute, 2022). Thus, developing animal models to study processes related to retinal damage, specifically loss of photoreceptors and their pending degeneration/regeneration is critical. This study aims to modify current light-induced retinal degeneration (LIRD) protocols within the zebrafish model to more efficiently replicate the proliferative response that drives regeneration. The most common LIRD model incorporates a 10-14 day dark adaptation period followed by multiple days of constant intense light exposure designed to damage the retinas and induce a proliferation response (Thomas et al., 2012; Vihtelic & Hyde, 2000). Modified procedures have been published and demonstrate that shortened 24-hour dark adaptation periods still result in cellular damage via apoptosis, but the proliferation response (i.e., pending regeneration) was not examined (Khan et al., 2020). Therefore, our study aims to fully eliminate dark adaptation and will use changes in retinal morphology and proliferation as the hallmark of a successfully initiated regeneration response. Dark-adapted (DA-control fish) and non-dark-adapted (NDA-experimental fish) were taken off their housing system and exposed to constant intense light for 24, 36, and 48 hr. to ensure enough time for damage and proliferation to proceed. Retinas were cross-sectioned to include dorsal and ventral retina, immunohistochemically labeled, and the outer nuclear layer (ONL), inner nuclear layer (INL), cones, and proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were analyzed to determine the level of structural integrity, if cell photoreceptor numbers were altered, and if proliferation occurred in response to light exposure. Dark-adapted (DA) and non-dark-adapted (NDA) zebrafish retinas displayed similar damage and increased proliferation responses to the constant intense light, indicating that the 10-14-day dark adaptation period is not necessary to induce regeneration in adult zebrafish retinas, reducing experimental timing by two weeks.",

Here, we identify the role of {beta}6 in mediating the Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) through the regulation of intracellular trafficking. We demonstrate that deletion of the {beta}6 integrin in lung epithelial cells significantly enhances the TLR7-mediated activation of the type I interferon (IFN) response during homeostasis and respiratory infection. IAV-induced {beta}6 facilitates TLR7 trafficking to lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP2a) components, leading to a reduction in endosomal compartments and associated TLR7 signaling.

    "abstract": "The emergence of antimicrobial resistance has created an urgent need for alternative treatment strategies against deadly bacterial species. In this study, we investigated the potential of kinase inhibitors as host-directed therapies (HDTs) for combating infectious diseases caused by intracellular bacteria, specifically Salmonella Typhimurium (Stm) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We screened 827 ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors with known target profiles from two Published Kinase Inhibitor Sets (PKIS1 and PKIS2) using intracellular infection models for Stm and Mtb, based on human cell lines and primary macrophages. Additionally, the in vivo efficacy of the compounds was assessed using zebrafish embryo infection models. Our kinase inhibitor screen identified 14 hit compounds for Stm and 19 hit compounds for Mtb that were effective against intracellular bacteria and non-toxic for host cells. Further validation experiments showed the high efficacy of most Stm hit compounds and their ability to fully clear the intracellular infection both in cell lines and primary human macrophages. From these, two structurally related Stm hit compounds, GSK1379738A and GSK1379760A, exhibited significant effectiveness against Stm in infected zebrafish embryos. Compounds that were active against intracellular Mtb included morpholino-imidazo/triazolo-pyrimidinones that specifically target the kinases PIK3CB and PIK3CD as well as 2-aminobenzimidazoles targeting BLK, ABL1 and TRKA. Overall, this study provided insight into critical kinase targets acting at the host-pathogen interface and identified novel kinase inhibitors as potential HDTs for intracellular bacterial infections.",

Here, we determined the neurotropism and neurovirulence of MPXV using human pluripotent stem cell- (hPSC)-derived neural stem cells, astrocytes, cortical neurons, and microglia together with ex vivo human brain tissue. We found that MPXV infects and replicates more efficiently in astrocytes and microglia compared to cortical neurons, which unlike glial cells showed activation of distinct antiviral programs that may confer differential susceptibility to MPXV. Ex vivo infection of human brain tissue confirmed the susceptibility of astrocytes to MPXV infection, which also had the strongest disease-associated changes. Molecular pathway analyses revealed induction of cellular senescence and a senescence-associated secretory phenotype upon MPXV infection in astrocytes. Finally, we demonstrated that antiviral treatment using tecovirimat inhibits MPXV replication and prevents virus-induced senescence in hPSC-derived astrocytes. Altogether, leveraging hPSC-derived brain cells, we reveal MPXV-induced cell type-specific effects at the molecular and cellular level, which provide important insights into the neuropathogenesis of MPXV infection.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial growth and division rely on intricate regulation of morphogenetic complexes to remodel the cell envelope without compromising envelope integrity. Significant progress has been made in recent years towards understanding the regulation of cell wall metabolic enzymes. However, other cell envelope components play a role in morphogenesis as well. Components required to maintain osmotic homeostasis are among these understudied envelope-associated enzymes that may contribute to cell morphology. A primary factor required to protect envelope integrity in low osmolarity environments is OpgH, the synthase of osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (OPGs). Here, we demonstrate that OpgH is essential in the -proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Unexpectedly, depletion of OpgH results in striking asymmetric bulging and cell lysis, accompanied by misregulation of cell wall insertion and mislocalization of morphogenetic complexes. The enzymatic activity of OpgH is required for normal cell morphology as production of an OpgH mutant that disrupts a conserved glycosyltransferase motif phenocopies the depletion. Our data establish a surprising function for an OpgH homolog in morphogenesis and reveal an essential role of OpgH in maintaining proper cell morphology during normal growth and division in Caulobacter.\n\nSignificanceBacteria must synthesize and fortify the cell envelope in a tightly regulated manner to orchestrate growth and adaptation. Osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (OPGs) are important, but poorly understood, constituents of Gram-negative cell envelopes that contribute to envelope integrity and protect against osmotic stress. Here, we determined that the OPG synthase OpgH plays a surprising, essential role in morphogenesis in Caulobacter crescentus. Loss of OpgH causes asymmetric cell bulging and lysis via misregulation of the localization and activity of morphogenetic complexes. Because cell envelope integrity is critical for bacterial survival, understanding how OpgH activity contributes to morphogenesis could aid in the development of antibiotic therapies.",

Diseases of unknown causes are common in both environments. We conducted a metagenomic survey to broadly compare the zebrafish-associated microbes in pet trade and laboratory environments. We detected many microbes in animals from the pet trade that were not found in laboratory animals. Co-housing experiments revealed several transmissible microbes including a newly described non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus in the Birnaviridae family we name Rocky Mountain birnavirus (RMBV). Infections were detected in asymptomatic animals from the pet trade, but when transmitted to laboratory animals RMBV was associated with pronounced antiviral responses and hemorrhagic disease.

    "abstract": "Wild non-human primates carry many types of RNA viruses, including simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), simian foamy virus, simian T-cell leukemia virus, and hepatitis C virus. These viruses can also infect humans via zoonotic transmission through handling and consumption of primate bushmeat. Characterizing viral prevalence and shedding in natural hosts is critical to understand infection and transmission risks within and between primate species. Here, we sought to identify a robust \"field-friendly\" method (i.e., without freezing or refrigeration) for preserving viral RNA, specifically SIV, in primate fecal samples. Fecal samples were collected from a mantled guereza colobus (Colobus guereza) housed at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. Samples were homogenized and inoculated with three concentrations (low, medium, high) of inactivated SIV virus and preserved in four different storage buffers (DNA/RNA Shield, RNAlater, 95% Ethanol, and Viral Transport Medium). SIV viral RNA was then extracted from samples at four time points (1 week, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks) to determine the efficacy of each buffer for preserving SIV RNA. Quantitative RT-PCR was used for detection and quantification of viral RNA. At all concentrations, DNA/RNA Shield yielded the highest average SIV virion concentrations. We then successfully validated this approach using fecal samples from known SIV-positive and SIV-negative sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) housed at Emory National Primate Research Center. Our results indicate that DNA/RNA shield is an optimal \"field-friendly\" buffer for preserving SIV RNA in fecal samples over time, and may also be effective for preserving other RNA viruses in feces.\n\nImportanceHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was introduced into human populations through zoonotic transmission of SIV from African primates, leading to a global epidemic and ongoing worldwide public health issue. SIV occurs naturally in over 40 primate species in sub-Saharan Africa and these viruses have crossed species barriers on multiple occasions, leading to the spread of HIV-1 and HIV-2. Quantifying RNA viruses in wild primate populations can be challenging as invasive sampling is often not feasible, and many field stations lack ready access to a freezer for storing biological samples. This study compares SIV RNA preservation and recovery across multiple storage buffers to identify a robust field-friendly option for RNA viral detection in noninvasively collected feces. Our results will inform future fieldwork and facilitate improved approaches to characterizing prevalence, shedding, and transmission of RNA viruses like SIV in natural hosts including wild-living nonhuman primates.",

    "abstract": "For Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806, temperature decreases from 26{degrees} C to 19{degrees} C double the microcystin quota per cell during growth in continuous culture. Here we tested whether this increase in microcystin provided M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 with a fitness advantage during colder-temperature growth by comparing cell concentration, cellular physiology, and the transcriptomics-inferred metabolism to a non-toxigenic mutant strain M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 {Delta}mcyB. Photo-physiological data combined with transcriptomic data revealed metabolic changes in the mutant strain during growth at 19{degrees} C, which included increased electron sinks and non-photochemical quenching. Increased gene expression was observed for a glutathione-dependent peroxiredoxin during cold treatment, suggesting compensatory mechanisms to defend against reactive oxygen species are employed in the absence of microcystin in the mutant. Our observations highlight the potential selective advantages of a longer-term defensive strategy in management of oxidative stress (i.e., making microcystin) vs the shorter-term proactive strategy of producing cellular components to actively dissipate or degrade oxidative stress agents.\n\nImportanceThrough comparisons of a microcystin-producing wildtype strain M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 and a non microcystin-producing mutant, M. aeruginosa PCC 7806{Delta} mcyB, our observations highlight defensive (microcystin production) vs active (production of degradation enzymes and increased electron sinks) strategies for dealing with cold-temperature induced oxidative stress as well as associated physiological changes. This work increases our understanding of microcystins intracellular function, and the role it may play in bloom ecology. In combination with other studies, this work begins to experimentally establish a mechanistic foundation to better understand cold-to-warm seasonal transitions from toxigenic to non-toxigenic strains frequently observed in situ.",

    "abstract": "Enveloped viruses often exhibit a pleomorphic morphology, ranging in size from 100nm spheres to tens-of-micron long filaments. For influenza A virus (IAV), spheres enable rapid replication and minimize metabolic cost, while filaments resist effects of antibodies or other cell-entry pressures. The current paradigm is that virion shape changes require genetic adaptation; however, a virus evolved to alter its shape phenotypically would outperform one that relies on genetic selection. Using a novel quantitative flow virometry assay to characterize virion shape dynamics we find that IAV rapidly tunes its shape distribution to favor spheres under optimal, and filaments under attenuating conditions including the presence of antibodies. We identify membrane tension as a key cue sensed by IAV determining shape distributions. This phenotypic shift outpaces genetic change and serves to enable additional life cycles under pressure. Our work expands knowledge of the complex host-virus interplay to include viral responses to the local environment by optimizing its structure to maximize replication and ultimately host-host transmission.",

While acute left ventricle (LV) unloading by percutaneous LV assist device (pLVAD) is now a therapeutic option, its impact on ECM is unknown. We hypothesize that the composition of LV ECM proteins changes in response to reduced wall stress with mechanical LV unloading.\n\nMethodsTen Yorkshire pigs underwent myocardial infarction, and one week later were subjected to either 2 hours of LV unloading with pLVAD or 2 hours of LV overloading by mechanically-induced acute aortic regurgitation. Non-ischemic remote myocardium was processed for ECM specific proteomics. Volcano plots were constructed to determine differentially expressed proteins between the groups. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed to identify associated molecular processes and biological functions. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed to validate differential protein expression.\n\nResultsOf the 986 proteins analyzed, 39 were significantly differentially expressed between overloaded and unloaded myocardium. GO analysis by molecular function revealed that differences tending towards RNA binding and lipid binding proteins. Analysis by biological process showed that cell differentiation, vesicle transport, and programmed cell death were the processes most affected. Staining for three of the identified differentially expressed proteins had results congruent with proteomic analysis.\n\nConclusionsThere were significant differences in the protein composition of the cardiac ECM between acutely unloaded and overloaded myocardium, suggesting that it actively responds to altered LV load.",

    "abstract": "The late stages of the mammalian pregnancy are accompanied with increased insulin resistance due to the increased glucose demand of the growing fetus. Therefore, as a compensatory response to maintain the maternal normal blood glucose levels, maternal beta-cell mass expands leading to increased insulin release. Defects in beta-cell adaptive expansion during pregnancy can lead to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Although the exact mechanisms that promote GDM are poorly understood, GDM strongly associates with impaired beta-cell proliferation and with increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we show that NRF2 levels are upregulated in mouse beta-cells at gestation day 15 (GD15) concomitant with increased beta-cell proliferation. Importantly, mice with tamoxifen-induced beta-cell-specific NRF2 deletion display inhibition of beta-cell proliferation, increased beta-cell oxidative stress and elevated levels of beta-cell death at GD15. This results in attenuated beta-cell mass expansion and disturbed glucose homeostasis towards the end of pregnancy. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of NRF2-oxidative stress regulation in beta-cell mass adaptation to pregnancy and suggest NRF2 as a potential therapeutic target for treating GDM.",

A prevailing hypothesis postulates that LMNA mutations cause nuclear envelope ruptures that trigger pathogenic inflammatory signaling via the cGAS-STING cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway. Here, we provide evidence against this hypothesis, using a mouse model of LMNA-related cardiomyopathy that mimics Lamin A/C protein reduction observed in patient cardiomyocytes. We observed that pervasive nuclear envelope ruptures preceded the onset of cardiac transcriptional modulation and dilated cardiomyopathy. Nuclear ruptures activated DNA damage response without causing immediate cardiomyocyte death. However, cGAS-STING downstream cytokine genes remained inactive in the mutant cardiomyocytes. Deleting cGas or Sting did not alleviate cardiomyopathy. Instead, extracellular matrix signaling was predicted to emanate from Lamin A/C-reduced cardiomyocytes to communicate with fibroblasts in the heart. These findings suggest that cGAS-STING is not a major pathogenetic contributor to LMNA-related dilated cardiomyopathy in adult humans.",

    "abstract": "The Ccr4-Not complex containing the Not4 ubiquitin ligase regulates gene transcription and mRNA decay, yet it also has poorly defined roles in translation, proteostasis, and endolysosomal-dependent nutrient signaling. To define how Ccr4-Not mediated ubiquitin signaling regulates these additional processes, we performed quantitative proteomics in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking the Not4 ubiquitin ligase, and also in cells overexpressing either wild-type or functionally inactive ligase. Herein, we provide evidence that both increased and decreased Ccr4-Not ubiquitin signaling disrupts ribosomal protein (RP) homeostasis independently of reduced RP mRNA changes or reductions in known Not4 ribosomal substrates. Surprisingly, we also find that both Not4-mediated ubiquitin signaling, and the Ccr4 subunit, actively inhibit 40S ribosomal autophagy. This 40S autophagy is independent of canonical Atg7-dependent macroautophagy, thus indicating microautophagy activation is responsible. Furthermore, the Not4 ligase genetically interacts with endolysosomal pathway effectors to control both RP expression and 40S autophagy efficiency. Overall, we demonstrate that balanced Ccr4-Not ligase activity maintains RP homeostasis, and that Ccr4-Not ubiquitin signaling interacts with the endolysosomal pathway to both regulate RP expression and inhibit 40S ribosomal autophagy.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of antibody light chain proteins is associated with the progressive disease light chain amyloidosis. Patient-derived amyloid fibrils are formed from light chain variable domain residues in non-native conformations, highlighting a requirement that light chains unfold from their native structures in order to aggregate. However, mechanistic studies of amyloid formation have primarily focused on the self-assembly of natively unstructured peptides, and the role of native state unfolding is less well understood. Using a well-studied light chain variable domain protein known as WIL, which readily aggregates in vitro under conditions where the native state predominates, we asked how the protein concentration and addition of pre-formed fibril \"seeds\" alter the kinetics of aggregation. Monitoring aggregation with thioflavin T fluorescence revealed a distinctly non-linear dependence on concentration, with a maximum aggregation rate observed at 8 {micro}M protein. This behavior is consistent with formation of alternate aggregate structures in the early phases of amyloid formation. Addition of N- or C-terminal peptide tags, which did not greatly affect the folding or stability of the protein, altered the concentration dependence of aggregation. Aggregation rates increased in the presence of pre-formed seeds, but this effect did not eliminate the delay before aggregation and became saturated when the proportion of seeds added was greater than 1 in 1600. The complexity of aggregation observed in vitro highlights how multiple species may contribute to amyloid pathology in patients.",

    "abstract": "Candida auris is frequently associated with biofilm-related invasive infections. The resistant profile of these biofilms necessitates innovative therapeutic options, where quorum sensing may be a potential target. Farnesol and tyrosol are two fungal quorum-sensing molecules with antifungal effects at supraphysiological concentrations. To date there has been no high-throughput comparative molecular analysis regarding the background of farnesol- or tyrosol-related effects against C. auris biofilms. Here, we performed genome-wide transcript profiling with C. auris biofilms following 75 M farnesol or 15 mM tyrosol exposure using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). The analysis highlighted that the number of up-regulated genes (a minimum 1.5-fold increase) was 686 and 138 for tyrosol and farnesol, respectively, while 662 and 199 genes were down-regulated (a minimum 1.5-fold decrease) for tyrosol and farnesol, respectively. The overlap between tyrosol- and farnesol-responsive genes was considerable (101 and 116 overlapping up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively). Genes involved in biofilm events, glycolysis, ergosterol biosynthesis, fatty acid oxidation, iron metabolism, and autophagy were primarily affected in treated cells. Farnesol caused an 89.9%, 73.8%, and 32.6% reduction in the calcium, magnesium, and iron content, respectively, whereas tyrosol resulted an 82.6%, 76.6%, and 81.2% decrease in the calcium, magnesium, and iron content compared to the control, respectively. Moreover, the complexation of farnesol, but not tyrosol, with ergosterol is impeded in the presence of exogenous ergosterol, resulting in a minimum inhibitory concentration increase in the quorum-sensing molecules. This study revealed several farnesol- and tyrosol-specific responses, which will contribute to the development of alternative therapies against C. auris biofilms.\n\nImportanceCandida auris is a multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen, which is frequently associated with biofilm related infections. Candida-derived quorum-sensing molecules (farnesol and tyrosol) play a pivotal role in the regulation of fungal morphogenesis and biofilm development. Furthermore, they may have remarkable anti-biofilm effects, especially at supraphysiological concentrations. Innovative therapeutic approaches interfering with quorum-sensing may be a promising future strategy against C. auris biofilms; however, limited data are currently available concerning farnesol-induced and tyrosol-related molecular effects in C. auris. Here, we detected several genes involved in biofilm events, glycolysis, ergosterol biosynthesis, fatty acid oxidation, iron metabolism, and autophagy, which were primarily influenced following farnesol or tyrosol exposure. Moreover, calcium, magnesium, and iron homeostasis were also significantly affected. These results reveal molecular events that provide definitive explanations for the observed anti-biofilm effect; furthermore, they support the development of novel therapeutic approaches against C. auris biofilms.",

    "abstract": "Egress of intracellular bacteria from host cells and cellular tissues is a critical process during the infection cycle. This egress process is essential for bacteria to spread inside the host and can influence the outcome of an infection. For the obligate intracellular Gram-negative zoonotic bacterium Chlamydia psittaci little is known about the mechanisms resulting in chlamydial egress from the infected epithelium. Here, we describe and characterize a novel non-lytic egress pathway of C. psittaci by formation of Chlamydia-containing spheres (CCS). CCS are spherical, low phase contrast structures surrounded by a phosphatidylserine exposing membrane with specific barrier functions. They contain infectious progeny and morphologically impaired cellular organelles. The formation of CCS shares characteristics of apoptotic cell death including a proteolytic cleavage of the peptide DEVD albeit independent of active caspase-3, an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration of infected cells, followed by blebbing of the plasma membrane and rupture of the inclusion membrane. Finally, infected blebbing cells detach and leave the monolayer thereby forming CCS. These results support that Chlamydia psittaci egresses the epithelial cell by a novel non-lytic egress pathway, a process beneficial for the bacterium, which might influence the outcome of the infection in organisms.\n\nImportanceHost cell egress is essential for intracellular pathogens to spread within an organism and for host-to-host-transmission. Here, we describe CCS formation as a novel egress pathway for the intracellular, zoonotic bacterial pathogen C. psittaci. This non-lytic egress pathway is fundamentally different from previously described Chlamydia egress pathways. Interestingly, CCS formation shares several characteristics of apoptotic cell death. However, the sequence of proteolytic activity, followed by plasma membrane blebbing and the final detachment of a whole phosphatidylserine exposing former host cell is unique for C. psittaci. Thus, CCS formation represents a new egress pathway for intracellular pathogens that could possibly be linked to C. psittaci biology including host tropism, protection from host cell defense mechanisms or bacterial pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated during cellular energy perturbation. AMPK is composed of three subunits and several variants of AMPK complexes are expressed in skeletal muscle. The regulatory AMPK{gamma}3 subunit is predominantly expressed in fast-twitch muscle fibers. A human AMPK{gamma}3 R225W mutation has been described in two families. In cultured cells derived from R225W carrier muscle, the mutation was reported to increase total AMPK activity. In addition, elevated glycogen levels were observed in skeletal muscle. This led to the idea of AMPK{gamma}3 being involved in glycogen levels in skeletal muscle. Evidence for such a causative link has never been provided.\n\nResultsWe studied newly obtained muscle biopsies from three human carriers of the AMPK{gamma}3 R225W mutation and matched controls and we developed a novel knock-in mouse model carrying the AMPK{gamma}3 R225W mutation (KI HOM). In all three human pairs, the basal AMPK{gamma}3-associated activity was reduced when assayed in the absence of exogenous AMP. No difference was observed when assayed under AMP saturation, which was supported by findings in muscle of KI HOM mice. Furthermore, the well-established stimulatory effects of AICAR/muscle contraction on AMPK{gamma}3-associated activity were absent in muscle from KI HOM mice. Muscle glycogen levels were not affected by the mutation in human carriers or in KI HOM mice.\n\nConclusionsThe AMPK{gamma}3 R225W mutation does not impact AMPK-associated activity in mature human skeletal muscle and the mutation is not linked to glycogen accumulation. The R225W mutation ablates AMPK{gamma}3-associated activation by AICAR/muscle contractions, presumably through loss of nucleotide binding.",

    "abstract": "Oxysterol binding protein (OSBP)-related proteins (ORPs) 5 and 8 have been shown to deplete the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) at sites of membrane contact between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM). This is believed to be caused by transport of PI4P from the PM to the ER, where PI4P is degraded by an ER-localized SAC1 phosphatase. This is proposed to power the anti-port of phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids from ER to PM, up their concentration gradient. Alternatively, ORPs have been proposed to sequester PI4P, dependent on the concentration of their alternative lipid ligand. Here, we aimed to distinguish these possibilities in living cells by orthogonal targeting of PI4P transfer and degradation to PM-mitochondria contact sites. Surprisingly, we found that orthogonal targeting of SAC1 to mitochondria enhanced PM PI4P turnover independent of targeting to contact sites with the PM. This turnover could be slowed by knock-down of soluble ORP2, which also has a major impact on PM PI4P levels even without SAC1 over-expression. The data reveal a role for contact site-independent modulation of PM PI4P levels and lipid antiport.",

    "abstract": "Cellular signaling involves a large repertoire of membrane receptors operating in overlapping spatiotemporal regimes and targeting many common intracellular effectors. However, both the molecular mechanisms and physiological roles of crosstalk between receptors, especially those from different superfamilies, are poorly understood. We find that the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), TrkB, and the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), together mediate a novel form of hippocampal synaptic plasticity in response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Activated TrkB enhances constitutive mGluR5 activity to initiate a mode-switch that drives BDNF-dependent sustained, oscillatory Ca2+ signaling and enhanced MAP kinase activation. This crosstalk is mediated, in part, by synergy between G{beta}{gamma}, released by TrkB, and Gq-GTP, released by mGluR5, to enable a previously unidentified form of physiologically relevant RTK/GPCR crosstalk.",

    "abstract": "The prion-like spread of protein aggregates is a leading hypothesis for the propagation of neurofibrillary lesions in the brain, including the spread of tau inclusions associated with Alzheimers disease. The mechanisms of cellular uptake of tau seeds and subsequent nucleated polymerization of cytosolic tau are major questions in the field, and the potential for coupling between the entry and nucleation mechanisms has been little explored. We found that in primary astrocytes, endocytosis of tau seeds leads to their accumulation in lysosomes. This in turn leads to lysosomal swelling, deacidification and recruitment of ESCRT proteins, but not Galectin-3, to the lysosomal membrane. These observations are consistent with nanoscale damage of the lysosomal membrane. Using live cell and STORM, imaging, nucleation of cytosolic tau occurs primarily at the lysosome membrane under these conditions. These data suggest that tau seeds escape from lysosomes via nanoscale damage rather than wholesale rupture, and that nucleation of cytosolic tau commences as soon as tau fibril ends emerge from the lysosomal membrane.",

    "abstract": "Studies on cancer resistance in the naked mole-rat (NMR) have generally failed to interrogate possible resistance mechanisms in a physiological context. Here, we provide evidence that the NMR presents as a novel model of tumor initiation. We developed an endogenous lung cancer model in NMRs, driven by an oncogenic Eml4-Alk fusion protein introduced through CRISPR- mediated genome editing. While this is sufficient to drive tumorigenesis in mice, the development of progressive disease in NMRs required the additional loss of key tumor suppressors. Our results show that tumor initiation in NMRs more closely recapitulates that of human tumors. This suggests that the proposed \"resistance\" of NMRs to cancer development may stem from tumor initiation events that are likely to be comparable to the mechanisms in human cells.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryTumor development in the cancer-resistant naked mole-rat more accurately represents the tumor initiation process in humans.",

    "abstract": "The Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) machinery constitutes a multisubunit protein complex that plays an essential role in membrane remodeling and trafficking. ESCRTs regulate a wide array of cellular processes, encompassing cytokinetic abscission, cargo sorting into multivesicular bodies (MVBs), membrane repair and autophagy. Given the versatile functionality of ESCRTs and the intricate organizational structure of the ESCRT complex, the targeted modulation of distinct ESCRT-mediated membrane deformations for functional dissection poses a considerable challenge. This study presents a pseudo-natural product targeting IST1-CHMP1B within the ESCRT-III complex. This compound specifically disrupts the interaction between IST1 and CHMP1B, thereby inhibiting the formation of IST1-CHMP1B copolymers essential for normal-topology membrane scission events. While the compound has no impact on cytokinesis, MVB sorting and exosome biogenesis, it rapidly hinders transferrin receptor (TfR) recycling in cells, resulting in the accumulation of transferrin in perinuclear endosomal recycling tubules. Stalled recycling endosomes acquire unconventional LC3 lipidation, establishing a link between non-canonical LC3 lipidation and endosomal recycling.",

    "abstract": "Hepatoblastoma, the most prevalent pediatric liver cancer, almost always carries a WNT-activating CTNNB1 mutation, yet exhibits notable molecular heterogeneity. To characterize this heterogeneity and identify novel targeted therapies, we performed comprehensive analysis of hepatoblastomas and tumor-derived organoids using single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, single-cell ATAC-seq and high throughput drug profiling. We identified two distinct tumor epithelial signatures: hepatic  fetal-like and WNT-high  embryonal-like signatures, displaying divergent WNT signaling patterns. The liver-specific WNT targets were enriched in the fetal-like group, while the embryonal-like group was enriched in canonical WNT target genes. Gene regulatory network analysis revealed enrichment of regulons related to hepatic function such as bile acid, lipid and xenobiotic metabolism in the fetal-like subgroup but not in the embryonal-like subgroup. In addition, the dichotomous expression pattern of the transcription factors HNF4A and LEF1 allowed for a clear distinction between the fetal- and embryonal-like tumors. We also performed high-throughput drug screening using patient-derived tumor organoids and identified sensitivity to multiple inhibitor classes, most notably HDAC inhibitors. Intriguingly, embryonal-like tumor organoids, but not fetal-like tumor organoids, were sensitive to FGFR inhibitor treatments, suggesting a dependency on FGFR signaling. In summary, our data uncover the molecular and drug sensitivity landscapes of hepatoblastoma and pave the way for the development of targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in spatial omics methods are revolutionising biomedical research by enabling detailed molecular analyses of cells and their interactions in their native state. As most technologies capture only a specific type of molecules, there is an unmet need to enable integration of multiple spatial-omics datasets. This, however, presents several challenges as these analyses typically operate on separate tissue sections at disparate spatial resolutions. Here, we established a spatial multi-omics integration pipeline enabling co-registration and granularity matching, and applied it to integrate spatial transcriptomics, mass spectrometry-based lipidomics, single nucleus RNA-seq and histomorphological information from human prostate cancer patient samples. This approach revealed unique correlations between lipids and gene expression profiles that are linked to distinct cell populations and histopathological disease states and uncovered molecularly different subregions not discernible by morphology alone. By its ability to correlate datasets that span across the biomolecular and spatial scale, the application of this novel spatial multi-omics integration pipeline provides unprecedented insight into the intricate interplay between different classes of molecules in a tissue context. In addition, it has unique hypothesis-generating potential, and holds promise for applications in molecular pathology, biomarker and target discovery and other tissue-based research fields.",

    "abstract": "Resistance of cancers to treatments, such as chemotherapy, largely arise due to cell mutations. These mutations allow cells to resist apoptosis and inevitably lead to recurrence and often progression to more aggressive cancer forms. Sustained-low dose therapies are being considered as an alternative over maximum tolerated dose treatments, whereby a smaller drug dosage is given over a longer period of time. However, understanding the impact that the presence of treatment-resistant clones may have on these new treatment modalities is crucial to validating them as a therapeutic avenue. In this study, a Moran process is used to capture stochastic mutations arising in cancer cells, inferring treatment resistance. The model is used to predict the probability of cancer recurrence given varying treatment modalities. The simulations predict that sustained-low dose therapies would be virtually ineffective for a cancer with a non-negligible probability of developing a sub-clone with resistance tendencies. Furthermore, calibrating the model to in vivo measurements for breast cancer treatment with Herceptin, the model suggests that standard treatment regimens are ineffective in this mouse model. Using a simple Moran model, it is possible to explore the likelihood of treatment success given a non-negligible probability of treatment resistant mutations and suggest more robust therapeutic schedules.",

Utilizing zebrafish expressing a Wnt reporter, we identified several drugs that suppressed Wnt signaling without compromising zebrafish development.

Notably, Erlotinib treatment reduced self-renewal in human T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia cells, which are known to rely on active {beta}-catenin signaling for maintenance of leukemia-initiating cells. Erlotinib also reduced leukemia-initiating cell frequency and delayed disease formation in zebrafish models.
