    "abstract": "In this study, I describe a model in which mechanical linkages dynamically interact in a stepwise and reversible manner, and use it to model the chemical cycle and lever arm action of the biomolecular motor myosin. Myosin is emulated using a series of multivalent chemical reactions between a linkage enzyme and four reactants: a cleaveable fuel, two cleavage products, and ligand. Geometric coupling between the fuel and ligand binding sites--an analog for negative allosteric coupling--allows reaction sequences similar to nucleotide exchange to take place that in turn drive the \"strokes\" of the machines lever arm. Cyclic chemical behavior is demonstrated by stochastic simulation, and mechanical activity by a series of logical arguments. I show how a reciprocal and nonreciprocal conformational cycle emerge from the allosteric rules designed to achieve chemical cycling, and how the non-reciprocal cycle can break directional symmetry along a track like structure. A dimeric construct is used to demonstrate how directed motion can be designed by inhibition of the reciprocal cycle and reinforcement of the non-reciprocal cycle, through allosteric feedback between the units of the dimer. By showing how the chemomechanical cycle of a biomolecular motor can be recreated with simple geometric and chemical principles, this work may help advance the rational design of allosteric mechanisms, and the development of synthetic molecular motors.",

    "abstract": "No phenotypic trait evolves independently of all other traits, but the cause of trait-trait coevolution is poorly understood. While the coevolution could arise simply from pleiotropic mutations that simultaneously affect the traits concerned, it could also result from multivariate natural selection favoring certain trait relationships. To gain a general mechanistic understanding of trait-trait coevolution, we examine the evolution of 220 cell morphology traits across 16 natural strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the evolution of 24 wing morphology traits across 110 fly species of the family Drosophilidae, along with the variations of these traits among gene deletion or mutation accumulation lines (a.k.a. mutants). For numerous trait pairs, the phenotypic correlation among evolutionary lineages differs significantly from that among mutants. Specifically, we find hundreds of cases where the evolutionary correlation between traits is strengthened or reversed relative to the mutational correlation, which, according to our population genetic simulation, is likely caused by multivariate selection. Furthermore, we detect selection for enhanced modularity of the yeast traits analyzed. Together, these results demonstrate that trait-trait coevolution is shaped by natural selection and suggest that the pleiotropic structure of mutation is not optimal. Because the morphological traits analyzed here are chosen largely because of their measurability and thereby are not expected to be biased with regard to natural selection, our conclusion is likely general.",

    "abstract": "Male genitalia are rapidly evolving structures, often driven sexual selection to increase fertilization success. Although sexual selection on females can be strong in systems where males provide offspring care or feed their mates, sometimes resulting in the evolution of female ornamentation, there are no actual estimates of direct sexual selection on female genitalia. In a New Zealand ground weta, Hemiandrus pallitarsis (Orthoptera: Ensifera, Anostostomatidae), females possess a genitalic device (the accessory organ) that is necessary for successful copulation and the acquisition of glandular food-gifts from males. These nutritious gifts are known to result in sexual competition among females in other ensiferan species. In ground weta, the gifts are probably important in avoiding starvation during a months-long period when caring for (their lifetime production of) eggs and offspring. Here, we test the hypothesis that the accessory organ is a sexually selected device in H. pallitarsis by measuring the female Bateman gradient and directional sexual selection on the accessory organ. Using newly developed and characterized microsatellite loci, we analyze offspring and/or stored sperm to estimate female mating frequency for the first time in ground weta. As predicted, we found positive Bateman gradients for females, and some evidence of directional sexual selection on accessory organ length. Although organ length does not correlate well with female fecundity, it may increase mating success by indicating her condition and thus quality of her offspring care.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization generates inter-genomic interactions, which may result in unique traits not seen in either parent species. Here we explore the genetic basis of both carotenoid and anthocyanin floral pigmentation in hybrids between monkeyflower species Mimulus cupreus and M. luteus var. variegatus. Mimulus cupreus has abundant yellow carotenoid pigmentation in its petal lobes, while M. l. variegatus has a derived reduction in carotenoid intensity. Thus, as expected, carotenoid intensity segregates in an F2 hybrid population. More surprisingly, both species appear to have petal lobes solidly and identically covered in magenta anthocyanin pigment (which, when overlaid on the bright yellow carotenoid background, leads to an orange color in M. cupreus), yet F1 and F2 hybrids exhibit novel and complex spatial patterns of anthocyanin spotting. A rare yellow morph of M. cupreus, which lacks petal anthocyanins, also generates spatially patterned offspring when hybridized with M. l. variegatus. We use this cross, together with newly developed high-quality genome assembly of M. l. luteus and image analysis tools, to investigate the genetic architecture of color and pattern variation in an F2 hybrid population. We report a single QTL, containing the Beta-carotene hydroxylase (BCH) gene, associated with the non-patterned carotenoid reduction in M. l. variegatus. HPLC shows that relative beta-carotene abundance differs between dark yellow and light yellow petals, supporting a causal role for BCH. The presence versus absence of petal lobe anthocyanin segregates in a 3:1 ratio, and we report (as expected) an associated QTL encompassing the anthocyanin activator MYB5a/NEGAN which has previously been shown to be both necessary and sufficient to activate petal lobe anthocyanins in M. l. variegatus. Anthocyanin patterning was more complex, with seven QTLs associated with five quantitative patterning traits on the upper petals; 11 on the lower petals; and three qualitative whole-flower patterning traits. Although power was too limited to effectively test for epistatic interactions in this cross, the QTLs provide candidate genomic regions for further investigating the molecular mechanisms of spatially complex floral color patterning, and multiple candidate genes are identified including anthocyanin activators and an anthocyanin repressor.",

PD-L1 combined positivity score did not, whereas tumor mutational burden and APOBEC mutagenesis modestly predicted response. Using gene expression analysis, we defined the T cell-to-stroma enrichment (TSE) score, a signature-based metric that captures the relative abundance of T cells and stromal cells. Patients with a positive and negative TSE score show progression-free survival rates at 6 months of 67 and 0%, respectively. The TSE score was captured by immunofluorescence in tumor tissue, and validated in two independent ICI-treated cohorts of patients with mUC (IMvigor210) and muscle-invasive UC (ABACUS).

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo demonstrate a clear link between predicted blood shear forces during valve closure and thrombogenicity that explains the thrombogenic difference between tissue and mechanical valves and provides a practical metric to develop and refine prosthetic valve designs for reduced thrombogenicity.\n\nMethodsPulsatile and quasi-steady flow systems were used for testing. The time-variation of projected open valve area (POVA) was measured using analog opto-electronics calibrated to projected reference orifice areas. Flow velocity determined over the cardiac cycle equates as instantaneous volumetric flow rate divided by POVA. For the closed valve interval, data from quasi-steady back pressure/flow tests was obtained.\n\nPerformance ranked by derived maximum negative and positive closing flow velocities, evidences potential clinical thrombogenicity via inferred velocity gradients (shear). Clinical, prototype and control valves were tested.\n\nResultsBlood shear and clot potential from multiple test datasets guided empirical optimization and comparison of valve designs. A 3-D printed prototype valve design (BV3D) purposed for soft closure and reduced thrombogenic potential was assessed.\n\nConclusionsThe relationship between leaflet geometry, flow velocity and predicted shear at valve closure illuminated an important source of prosthetic valve thrombogenicity. With an appreciation for this relationship and based on our experiment generated comparative data, we achieved optimization of valve prototypes with potential for reduced thrombogenicity.\n\nCompeting InterestsNone declared.\n\nFinancial DisclosureThis research has been done on a pro bono basis by all authors.\n\nCENTRAL MESSAGEA derived laboratory metric for valve closing flow velocity offers a way to rank valve models for potential blood damage. These results provide new insight and a mechanistic explanation for prior clinical observations where aortic and mitral valve replacements differ in thrombogenic potential and anticoagulation requirement. The study suggests a path forward to design and evaluate novel mechanical valve models for future development. As multiple modifications to mechanical and bioprosthetic valves have not resolved chronic shortcomings related to thrombogenicity and durability, a new development avenue was required in order to eliminate thrombogenicity in the former and extend durability in the latter.\n\nPERSPECTIVEProsthetic mechanical valve devices cause blood cell damage. Activation of the coagulation cascade is initiated by dynamic valve function. Design innovation focusing on valve closure behavior may reduce valve thrombogenic potential. Our study demonstrates that valve design can be empirically optimized with emphasis on that phase.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEEmphasis on open valve performance has encouraged a long standing bias while under appreciation of the closing phase vital to identification of potential thrombogenic complications persist. Our multiple data sets are useful in challenging this bias.\n\nDynamic motion(s) of mechanical valves and derived regional flow velocity are impacted by valve geometry. Focus on valve closure dynamics may lead to the development of potentially less thrombogenic prototype valves. Laboratory experiments support the supposition that valve regional flow velocity is associated with valve thrombogenic potential. This study compares three clinical valves and two experimental prototypes.\n\nGraphical AbstractStatic flow illustrates free jets of water passing through closed mechanical valve gaps (SJM). Investigations with pulsatile flow suggest similar fleeting jets arise near valve closure. Flow velocity determined in-vitro is evidence for shear forces that are predictive of blood cell damage and thrombogenic response. Red star is moment of valve closure.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=174 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/497372v7_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (55K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18892cdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15dd184org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@664860org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@119cd32_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, due to the use of incompatible identifier systems for metabolites and reactions, computing and visualizing the metabolic differences and similarities of such models is a current challenge. Furthermore, there is a lack of automated tools that can combine the strengths of multiple reconstruction pipelines into a curated single comprehensive model by merging different drafts, which possibly use incompatible namespaces. Here we present mergem, a novel method to compare and merge two or more metabolic models. Using a universal metabolic identifier mapping system constructed from multiple metabolic databases, mergem robustly can compare models from different pipelines and merge their common elements. mergem is implemented as a command line tool, a Python package, and on the web-application Fluxer, which allows simulating and visually comparing multiple models with different interactive flux graphs. The ability to merge and compare diverse genome scale metabolic models can facilitate the curation of comprehensive reconstructions and the discovery of unique and common metabolic features among different organisms.",

An alternative method is to assemble short-reads with long-range connectivity, which can be a cost-effective way to generate high-quality microbial genomes. We developed Pangaea to improve metagenome assembly using short-reads with physical or virtual barcodes. It adopts a deep-learning-based binning algorithm to assemble the co-barcoded reads with similar sequence contexts and abundances to improve assemblies of high- and medium-abundance microbes. Pangaea also leverages a multi-thresholding reassembly strategy to refine assembly for low-abundance microbes. We benchmarked Pangaea with linked-reads and a combination of short- and long-reads from mock communities and human gut metagenomes. Pangaea achieved significantly higher contig continuity as well as more near-complete metagenome-assembled genomes (NCMAGs) than the existing assemblers. Pangaea was also observed to generate three complete and circular NCMAGs on the human gut microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "The consistency principle represents a physicochemical condition requisite for ideal protein folding. It assumes that any pair of amino acid residues in partially folded structures has an attractive short-range interaction only if the two residues are in contact within the native structure. The residue-specific equilibrium constant, K, and the residue-specific rate constant, k (forward and backward), can be determined by NMR and hydrogen-deuterium exchange studies. Linear free energy relationships (LFER) in the rate-equilibrium free energy relationship (REFER) plots (i.e., log k vs. log K) are widely seen in protein-related phenomena, but our REFER plot differs from them in that the data points are derived from one polypeptide chain under a single condition. Here, we examined the theoretical basis of the residue-based LFER. First, we derived a basic equation, {rho}ij = [1/2]({phi}i + {phi}j), from the consistency principle, where {rho}ij is the slope of the line segment that connects residues i and j in the REFER plot, and {phi}i and {phi}j are the local fractions of the native state in the transient state ensemble (TSE). Next, we showed that the general solution is the alignment of the (log K, log k) data points on a parabolic curve in the REFER plot. Importantly, unlike LFER, the quadratic free energy relationship (QFER) is compatible with the heterogenous formation of local structures in the TSE. Residue-based LFER/QFER provides a unique insight into the TSE: A foldable polypeptide chain consists of several folding units, which are consistently coupled to undergo smooth structural changes.\n\nSignificanceThe physicochemical basis of smooth protein folding has been theoretically explained by the consistency principle. We propose that the consistency principle is formulated by the quadratic relationship in the double logarithm plot of the residue-specific equilibrium and rate constants of a polypeptide chain. The quadratic relationship offers a procedure for the experimental verification of the consistency principle. One application is a {phi}-value analysis, free from the adverse effects of mutations. These results will trigger the development of experimental techniques that enable the determination of accurate residue-specific equilibrium and kinetic parameters for analyzing the transition states of structural changes in proteins.",

This Betaproteobacteria is incapable of metabolizing saccharides, yet colonizes the honey bee gut in the presence of only a sugar diet. Using comparative metabolomics, 13C tracers, and Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS), we show in vivo that S. alvi grows on host-derived organic acids, including citrate, glycerate and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate which are actively secreted by the host into the gut lumen.

    "abstract": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis that can lead to acquired heart disease in children mostly from developed countries. Its cause is still obscure and one explanation for its emergence is called \"hygiene hypothesis\" stating that the immune system of a newborn must be trained by common pathogens in order to reach its full development. In this study, we analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells from three febrile patients and KD patients to investigate the evidence for \"hygiene hypothesis\" of KD. Overall single-cell expression profiles show that the biological processes of immunity, B cell activation pathway and their related entities are upregulated in febrile patients and KD patients after IVIG treatment. The differentially expressed gene analyses further demonstrate that the cell cycle genes and MYC target genes are over expressed in KD patients before treatment. Paradoxically, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in KD patients before IVIG treatment exhibit a high expression pattern of the genes involved in immunity, immune response and B cell signaling pathway, i.e., a premature immune activation propensity. The cell differentiation trajectory is also shortened in KD patients before treatment compared with those in febrile patients and KD patients after treatment. Two cell cycle genes (HSPD1 and HSPE1) and MYC gene are early expressed in KD patients before treatment according pseudo-time analyses of cell development. The pseudo-time analyses of B cell development in three datasets indicate that a large proportion of B cells in KD patients before treatment are actually arrested in transitional state. Here, we argue that the HSPCs with a premature immune activation propensity is probably the cellular etiology behind Kawasaki disease, which lead to the symptoms of B cell dysplasia and malfunctional immune responses. Lacking of common pathogens in surroundings may be the cause of immune hyperactive HSPCs which treat everything as pathogen. Thus, our findings in this study are an affirmative support of \"hygiene hypothesis\".",

    "abstract": "tRNAs undergo an extensive maturation process involving post-transcriptional modifications often associated with tRNA structural stability and promoting the native fold. Impaired post-transcriptional modification has been linked to human disease, likely through defects in translation, mitochondrial function, and increased susceptibility to degradation by various tRNA decay pathways. More recently, evidence has emerged that bacterial tRNA modification enzymes can act as tRNA chaperones to guide tRNA folding in a manner independent from catalytic activity. Here, we provide evidence that the fission yeast tRNA methyltransferase Trm1, which dimethylates nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded tRNAs at G26, can also promote tRNA functionality in the absence of catalysis. We show that wild type and catalytic-dead Trm1 are active in an in vivo tRNA-mediated suppression assay and possess RNA strand annealing and dissociation activity in vitro, similar to previously characterized RNA chaperones. Trm1 and the RNA chaperone La have previously been proposed to function synergistically in promoting tRNA maturation, yet we surprisingly demonstrate that La binding to nascent pre-tRNAs decreases Trm1 tRNA dimethylation in vivo and in vitro. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis for tRNA modification enzymes that combine catalytic and non-catalytic activities to promote tRNA maturation, as well as expand our understanding of how La function can influence tRNA modification.",

    "abstract": "The conserved family of Transcription Intermediary Factors (TIF1) proteins consists of key transcriptional regulators that control transcription of target genes by modulating chromatin state. Unlike mammals that have four TIF1 members, Drosophila only encodes one member of the family, Bonus. Bonus has been implicated in embryonic development and organogenesis and shown to regulate several signaling pathways, however, its targets and mechanism of action remained poorly understood. We found that knockdown of Bonus in early oogenesis results in severe defects in ovarian development and in ectopic expression of genes that are normally repressed in the germline, demonstrating its essential function in the ovary. Recruitment of Bonus to chromatin leads to silencing associated with accumulation of the repressive H3K9me3 mark. We show that Bonus associates with the histone methyltransferase SetDB1 and the chromatin remodeler NuRD and depletion of either component releases Bonus-induced repression. We further established that Bonus is SUMOylated at a single site at its N-terminus that is conserved among insects and this modification is indispensable for Bonuss repressive activity. SUMOylation influences Bonuss subnuclear localization, its association with chromatin and interaction with SetDB1. Finally, we showed that Bonus SUMOylation is mediated by the SUMO E3-ligase Su(var)2-10, revealing that although SUMOylation of TIF1 proteins is conserved between insects and mammals, both the mechanism and specific site of modification is different in the two taxa. Together, our work identified Bonus as a regulator of tissue-specific gene expression and revealed the importance of SUMOylation as a regulator of complex formation in the context of transcriptional repression.",

    "abstract": "Photosynthesis is one of the most important reactions for sustaining our environment. Photosystem II (PSII) is the initial site of photosynthetic electron transfer by water oxidation. Light in excess, however, causes the simultaneous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to photo-oxidative damage in PSII. To maintain photosynthetic activity, the PSII reaction center protein D1, which is the primary target of unavoidable photo-oxidative damage, is efficiently degraded by FtsH protease. In PSII subunits, photo-oxidative modifications of several amino acids such as Trp have been indeed documented, whereas the linkage between such modifications and D1 degradation remains elusive. Here, we show that an oxidative post-translational modification of Trp residue at the N-terminal tail of D1 is correlated with D1 degradation by FtsH during high-light stress. We revealed that Arabidopsis mutant lacking FtsH2 had increased levels of oxidative Trp residues in D1, among which an N-terminal Trp-14 was distinctively localized in the stromal side. Further characterization of Trp-14 using chloroplast transformation in Chlamydomonas indicated that substitution of D1 Trp-14 to Phe, mimicking Trp oxidation enhanced FtsH-mediated D1 degradation under high light, although the substitution did not affect protein stability and PSII activity. Molecular dynamics simulation of PSII implies that both Trp-14 oxidation and Phe substitution cause fluctuation of D1 N-terminal tail. Furthermore, Trp-14 to Phe modification appeared to have an additive effect in the interaction between FtsH and PSII core in vivo. Together, our results suggest that the Trp oxidation at its N-terminus of D1 may be one of the key oxidations in the PSII repair, leading to processive degradation by FtsH.\n\nSignificance StatementIn photosynthetic organisms, maintenance of photosynthetic light reaction is manifested by so called Photosystem II (PSII) repair system, where the reaction center protein D1 is targeted to photo-oxidative damage and rapidly degraded by the processive protease FtsH. While this system is well known to cope with photoinhibition, the actual oxidation within the D1 polypeptide and its association to degradation remained elusive. Here, we characterized oxidative modification of tryptophan (Trp) residues in the PSII core, and hypothesize that the oxidation of N-terminal Trp is one of the key oxidations in the PSII repair, likely enhancing D1s accessibility to FtsH.",

    "abstract": "True crabs, or Brachyura, comprise over 7,300 known species and are among the most ecologically dominant, economically significant, and popularly recognized group of extant crustaceans. There are over 3,000 fossil brachyuran species known from mid and upper Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Cenozoic deposits across the globe, many of preserved in exquisite detail, but the origins and early evolution of true crabs remain unresolved. This uncertainty hinders the identification of the stratigraphically earliest occurrence of major brachyuran groups in the fossil record, obscuring our understanding of their phylogenetic relationships and thus the ability to estimate divergence times to answer large scale macroevolutionary questions. Here, we present 36 vetted fossil node calibration points for molecular phylogenetic analysis of crabs (one Anomura and 35 Brachyura) and reassess the earliest occurrences of several key clades based on recent fossil discoveries or re-examination of previous studies. For each calibrated node, we provide the minimum and tip maximum ages for the stratigraphically oldest fossil that can be reliably assigned to the group. Disentangling the anatomical disparity of fossil forms and their phylogenetic relationships is crucial to recognize the earliest branching members among brachyuran groups. This represents a critical first step understanding the evolution of carcinization and decarcinization in true crabs, the appearance of key adaptations, and the transition from sea to land and freshwater. The identification of reliable fossils for deep time calibrations, both as tips and nodes, is pivotal to ensure not only precise but more accurate divergence time estimations when reconstructing the crab tree of life.",

Mainstream approaches based on Optimal Control realize the mappings by minimizing cost functions, which is computationally demanding. Instead, Active Inference uses generative models to produce sensory predictions, which allows a cheaper inversion to the motor signals. However, devising generative models to control complex kinematic chains like the human body is challenging. We introduce a novel Active Inference architecture that affords a simple but effective mapping from extrinsic to intrinsic coordinates via inference and easily scales up to drive complex kinematic chains. Rich goals can be specified in both intrinsic and extrinsic coordinates using attractive or repulsive forces.

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite well-documented effects on human health, the action modes of environmental pollutants are incompletely understood. Although transcriptome-based approaches are widely used to predict associations between chemicals and disorders, the molecular cues regulating pollutant-derived gene expression changes remain unclear. Therefore, we developed a data-mining approach, termed \"DAR-ChIPEA,\" to identify transcription factors (TFs) playing pivotal roles in the action modes of pollutants.\n\nMethodsLarge-scale public ChIP-Seq data (human, n = 15,155; mouse, n = 13,156) were used to predict TFs that are enriched in the pollutant-induced differentially accessible genomic regions (DARs) obtained from epigenome analyses (ATAC-Seq). The resultant pollutant-TF matrices were then cross-referenced to a repository of TF-disorder associations to account for pollutant modes of action. We subsequently evaluated the performance of the proposed method using a chemical perturbation dataset to compare the outputs of the DAR-ChIPEA and our previously developed differentially expressed gene (DEG)-ChIPEA methods using pollutant-induced DEGs as input. We then adopted the proposed method to predict disease-associated mechanisms triggered by pollutants.\n\nResultsThe proposed approach outperformed other methods using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score. The mean score of the proposed DAR-ChIPEA was significantly higher than that of our previously described DEG-ChIPEA (0.7287 vs. 0.7060; Q = 5.278 x 10-42; two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The proposed approach further predicted TF-driven modes of action upon pollutant exposure, indicating that (1) TFs regulating Th1/2 cell homeostasis are integral in the pathophysiology of tributyltin-induced allergic disorders; (2) fine particulates (PM2.5) inhibit the binding of C/EBPs, Rela, and Spi1 to the genome, thereby perturbing normal blood cell differentiation and leading to immune dysfunction; and (3) lead induces fatty liver by disrupting the normal regulation of lipid metabolism by altering hepatic circadian rhythms.\n\nConclusionHighlighting genome-wide chromatin change upon pollutant exposure to elucidate the epigenetic landscape of pollutant responses outperformed our previously described method that focuses on gene-adjacent domains only. Our approach has the potential to reveal pivotal TFs that mediate deleterious effects of pollutants, thereby facilitating the development of strategies to mitigate damage from environmental pollution.",

    "abstract": "Do individual bacterial cells retain memories of the history of environmental conditions experienced in previous generations? Here we directly address this question through a synthesis of physics theory and high-precision experiments on statistically identical, non-interacting individual bacterial cells, which grow and divide with intrinsic stochasticity in precisely controlled conditions. From these data, we extract \"emergent simplicities\" in the seemingly complex interplay between history dependence, persistence, and transience in the stochastic memories of the dynamic environments experienced by individuals over multiple generations. First, we find that the instantaneous single-cell growth rate is the key physiologically relevant quantity where intergenerational memory is stored. In contrast, the cell size dynamics are memory free, or Markovian, over intergenerational timescales. Next, we find that the effect of experiencing dynamic environments can be captured quantitatively by recal-ibrating the cellular unit of time by the measured mean instantaneous growth rate; the dynamically rescaled cell age distributions undergo a scaling collapse. Moreover, in a given condition, an individual bacterial cell retains history-dependent, or non-Markovian, memory of its growth rate over tens of generations. We derive from first principles a physically-motivated metric to quantify the degree of non-Markovianity. Furthermore, when conditions change, the instantaneous single-cell growth distribution becomes bimodal, as the bacteriums memory of past environment encountered is reset stochastically and plastically, prior to achieving a new homeostasis.",

In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of KET and ISO effects on c-Fos expression across the brain, utilizing principal component analysis (PCA) and c-Fos-based functional network analysis to evaluate the responses of individual brain regions to each anesthetic. Our findings demonstrate that KET significantly activates cortical and subcortical arousal-promoting nuclei, with the somatosensory cortex (SS) serving as a hub node, corroborating the top-down general anesthesia theory for dissociative anesthesia. In contrast, ISO activates the nuclei in the hypothalamus and brainstem, with the locus coeruleus (LC) as a hub node, implying a bottom-up mechanism for anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. Notably, the coactivation of sleep-wakefulness regulation, analgesia-related, neuroendocrine-related nuclei (e.g., prelimbic area (PL) and infralimbic areas (ILA), and the anterior paraventricular nucleus (aPVT), Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW), locus coeruleus (LC), parabrachial nucleus (PB), solitary tract nucleus (NTS)) by both anesthetics underscores shared features such as unconsciousness, analgesia, and autonomic regulation, irrespective of their specific molecular targets.

While they share the capacity of immune suppression, their stabilities are different, with iTregs losing their phenotype upon stimulation or under inflammatory milieu. Epigenetic differences, particularly methylation state of Foxp3 CNS2 region, provide an explanation for this shift. Whether additional regulations, including cellular signaling, could directly lead phenotypical instability requires further analysis. Here we show that upon TCR triggering, store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and NFAT nuclear translocation are blunted in tTregs, yet fully operational in iTregs, similar to Tconvs. On the other hand, tTregs show minimal changes in their chromatin accessibility upon activation, in contrast to iTregs that demonstrate an activated chromatin state with highly accessible T cell activation and inflammation related genes. Assisted by several cofactors, NFAT driven by strong SOCE signaling in iTregs preferentially binds to primed opened T helper (TH) genes, resulting in their activation normally observed only in Tconv activation, ultimately leads to instability. Conversely, suppression of SOCE in iTregs can partially rescue their phenotype. Thus our study adds two new layer, cellular signaling and chromatin accessibility, of understanding in Treg stability, and may provide a path for better clinical applications of Treg cell therapy.",

G1D seizures, which constitute a prominent disease manifestation, often prove refractory to medications but may respond to therapeutic diets. These seizures are associated with aberrant thalamocortical oscillations as inferred from human electroencephalography and functional imaging. Mouse electrophysiological recordings indicate that inhibitory neuron failure in thalamus and cortex underlies these abnormalities. This provides the motivation to develop a neural circuit testbed to characterize the mechanisms of thalamocortical synchronization and the effects of known or novel interventions. To this end, we used mouse thalamocortical slices on multielectrode arrays and characterized spontaneous low frequency oscillations and less frequent 30-50 Hz or gamma oscillations under near-physiological bath glucose concentration. Using the cortical recordings from layer IV, we quantified oscillation epochs via an automated wavelet-based algorithm. This method proved analytically superior to power spectral density, short-time Fourier transform or amplitude-threshold detection. As expected from human observations, increased bath glucose reduced the lower frequency oscillations while augmenting the gamma oscillations, likely reflecting strengthened inhibitory neuron activity. This approach provides an ex vivo method for the evaluation of mechanisms, fuels, and pharmacological agents in a crucial G1D epileptogenic circuit.",

    "abstract": "Hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of the microtubule binding protein tau plays a key role in the development of Alzheimers disease. While the structure of the filamentous aggregates formed in humans has recently been determined to atomic resolution, there is far less information available about the smaller aggregate precursors, thought to be the most neurotoxic. To address this gap, we have developed a single molecule pull-down (SiMPull) able to detect tau aggregates in clinically relevant human samples. This method enables the detection and characterisation of individual tau aggregates, as opposed to averaged features obtained from traditional bulk techniques. We report the number, size and shape of individual aggregates measured via super-resolution microscopy, revealing disease-specific differences in tau aggregate morphology. By adapting the assay to simultaneously detect multiple phosphorylation sites in individual aggregates, we were also able to derive compositional profiles for pathological modifications present in individual aggregates. We demonstrate that tau aggregates in Alzheimers disease are significantly more likely to contain both the AT8 and T181 pathological phosphorylation markers, rather than only one. Together, tau SiMPull identified distinct subpopulations of large, modified tau aggregates that were invisible to traditional methodologies. These morphological and compositional differences distinguish samples taken from disease cohorts, offering to illuminate underlying disease mechanisms, and providing a foundation for novel diagnostic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) can be a powerful approach to understanding single-cell genomics datasets, but it is not yet part of standard data analysis workflows. In particular, geospatial analyses, which have been developed and refined for decades, have yet to be fully adapted and applied to spatial single-cell analysis. We introduce the Voyager platform, which systematically brings the geospatial ESDA tradition to (spatial) -omics, with local, bivariate, and multivariate spatial methods not yet commonly applied to spatial -omics, united by a uniform user interface. Using Voyager, we showcase biological insights that can be derived with its methods, such as biologically relevant negative spatial autocorrelation. Underlying Voyager is the SpatialFeatureExperiment data structure, which combines Simple Feature with SingleCellExperiment and AnnData to represent and operate on geometries bundled with gene expression data. Voyager has comprehensive tutorials demonstrating ESDA built on GitHub Actions to ensure reproducibility and scalability, using data from popular commercial technologies. Voyager is implemented in both R/Bioconductor and Python/PyPI, and features compatibility tests to ensure that both implementations return consistent results.",

    "abstract": "Tissue remodeling and shape changes often rely on force-induced cell rearrangements occurring via cell-cell contact dynamics. Epithelial cell-cell contact shape changes are particularly dependent upon E-cadherin adhesion dynamics which are directly influenced by cell-generated and external forces. While both the mobility of E-cadherin adhesions and their adhesion strength have been reported before, it is not clear how these two aspects of E-cadherin adhesion dynamics are related. Here, using magnetic pulling cytometry, we applied an accelerated force ramp on the E-cadherin adhesion between an E-cadherin-coated magnetic microbead and an epithelial cell to ascertain this relationship. Our approach enables the determination of the adhesion strength and force-dependent mobility of individual adhesions, which revealed a direct correlation between these key characteristics. Since -catenin has previously been reported to play a role in both E-cadherin mobility and adhesion strength when studied independently, we also probed epithelial cells in which -catenin has been knocked out. We found that, in the absence of -catenin, E-cadherin adhesions not only had lower adhesion strength, as expected, but were also more mobile. We observed that -catenin was required for the recovery of strained cell-cell contacts and propose that the adhesion strength and force-dependent mobility of E-cadherin adhesions act in tandem to regulate cell-cell contact homeostasis. Our approach introduces a method which relates the force-dependent adhesion mobility to adhesion strength and highlights the morphological role played by -catenin in E-cadherin adhesion dynamics.",

Survival analyses were performed and goodness-of-fit of multivariate models was evaluated using partial likelihood ratio tests, Akaikes test, or Bayesian information criteria to determine the superiority of our system over existing grading systems. Comprehensive survival analyses demonstrated the effectiveness of our AI-system in categorizing PCa into four distinct risk groups.

    "abstract": "ESCRTs (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport) are a modular set of protein complexes with membrane remodeling activities that include the formation and release of intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) to generate multivesicular endosomes. While most of the 12 ESCRT-III proteins are known to play roles in ILV formation, IST1 has been associated with a wider range of endosomal remodeling events. Here, we extend previous studies of IST1 function in endosomal trafficking and confirm that IST1, along with its binding partner CHMP1B, contributes to scission of early endosomal carriers. Depleting IST1 impaired delivery of transferrin receptor from early/sorting endosomes to the endocytic recycling compartment and instead increased its rapid recycling to the plasma membrane via peripheral endosomes enriched in the clathrin adaptor AP-1. IST1 is also important for export of mannose 6-phosphate receptor from early/sorting endosomes. Examination of IST1 binding partners on endosomes revealed that IST1 interacts with the MIT domain-containing sorting nexin SNX15, a protein previously reported to regulate endosomal recycling. Our kinetic and spatial analyses establish that SNX15 and IST1 occupy a clathrin-containing subdomain on the endosomal perimeter distinct from those previously implicated in cargo retrieval or degradation. Using live-cell microscopy we see that SNX15 and CHMP1B alternately recruit IST1 to this subdomain or the base of endosomal tubules. These findings indicate that IST1 contributes to a subset of recycling pathways from the early/sorting endosome.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=95 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/551359v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (16K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14c2658org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@699063org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@867084org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@44f7b6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

While naturally occurring in diverse environments, methanogenesis requires anaerobic and reduced conditions though varying degrees of oxygen tolerance have been described. Micro-aeration is touted as the next step to increase methane production and improve hydrolysis in digestion processes; therefore, a deeper understanding of the methanogenic response to oxygen stress is needed. In order to explore the drivers of oxygen tolerance in methanogenesis, two parallel enrichments were performed in an environment without reducing agents and in a redox-controlled environment by adding redox mediator AQDS. The cellular response to oxidative conditions is mapped using proteomic analysis. The resulting community showed remarkable tolerance to high-redox environments and was unperturbed in its methane production. Next to expressing pathways to mitigate reactive oxygen species, the higher redox potential environment showed an increased presence of selenocysteine and selenium-associated pathways. By including sulfur-to-selenium mass shifts in a proteomic database search, we provide the first evidence of dynamic and large-scale incorporation of selenocysteine as a response to oxidative stress by methanogenic organisms and the presence of a dynamic selenoproteome.",

Atypical DAT deficiency syndrome (DTSD) is a disease characterized by early-onset parkinsonism and comorbid psychiatric symptoms, but the pathobiological processes that link DAT dysfunction to both parkinsonism and psychiatric symptoms are unknown. Here, we present a genetic mouse model of atypical DTDS that expresses two coding DAT variants, DAT-I312F and DAT-D421N, derived from a patient diagnosed with ADHD and parkinsonism. Phenotypic characterization of the mutant mice revealed impaired DAT function and major homeostatic changes including increased ambient extracellular DA levels, decreased evoked DA release, and reduced expression of both tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and of DA D1/D2 receptors. This was accompanied by diminished striatal dopaminergic axonal density and a psychomotor phenotype characterized by hyperactivity, enhanced exploratory activity, and pronounced clasping. Importantly, both amphetamine and anticholinergic treatment ameliorated aberrant hyperlocomotion in the mice. Summarized, by replicating core aspects of the patients phenotype, the mouse model not only provides insights into the mechanisms underlying atypical DTDS but also underlines the broad relevance of DA deficits for understanding the co-morbidity between neuropsychiatric diseases and parkinsonism.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYIn a new mouse disease model, we explore the behavioral consequences and dopaminergic dysfunction that arise from patient-derived mutations in the dopamine transporter associated with parkinsonism and co-morbid neuropsychiatric disease",

The chemical depletion of granulocytes led to decreased phagocytic efficiency of tissues-associated hemocytes. We demonstrate E. chaffeensis can infect circulating hemocytes, and both cell-free plasma and hemocytes from E. chaffeensis-infected ticks can establish Ehrlichia infection in recipient ticks. Lastly, we provide evidence to show granulocytes play a dual role in E. chaffeensis infection. Depleting granulocytic hemocytes increased Ehrlichia load in the salivary gland and midgut tissues. In contrast, granulocyte depletion led to a reduced systemic load of Ehrlichia.

Attenuation of this pathway results in morphologically preserved severed axons and synapses for weeks after injury.

The mechanism enabling the preservation of circuit integrity is currently unknown. Here we demonstrate that dNmnat-mediated over-expression potently blocks programmed axon degeneration in Drosophila. Thus, severed axons and their synapses of distinct sensory neuron populations remain morphologically preserved and circuit-integrated for at least a week. We used ribosomal pulldown to isolate translatomes from these severed projections. Transcriptional profiling revealed several enriched biological classes. Identified candidates were assessed by the quantification of evoked antennal grooming behavior as proxy for preserved circuit integrity. We identified mediators of local protein synthesis, and specifically candidates involved in protein ubiquitination and calcium homeostasis required for the preservation of circuit integrity by RNAi-mediated knock-down. Our dataset uncovered several uncharacterized genes linked to human disease and may therefore offer insights into avenues for therapeutic treatments.",

LRRK2 mutations are a common genetic cause of PD which, in addition to neurodegeneration, often present with abnormal deposits of -synuclein in the form of Lewy-related pathology. As Lewy-related pathology is a prominent neuropathologic finding in sporadic PD, the relationship between LRRK2 and -synuclein has garnered considerable interest. However, whether and how LRRK2 might influence the accumulation of Lewy-related pathology remains poorly understood. Through stereotactic injection of mouse -synuclein pre-formed fibrils (PFF), we modeled the spread of Lewy-related pathology within forebrain regions where LRRK2 is most highly expressed. The impact of LRRK2 genotype on the formation of -synuclein inclusions was evaluated at 1-month post-injection. Neither deletion of LRRK2 nor G2019S LRRK2 knockin appreciably altered the burden of - synuclein pathology at this early timepoint. These observations fail to provide support for a robust pathophysiologic interaction between LRRK2 and -synuclein in the forebrain in vivo. There was, however, a modest reduction in microglial activation induced by PFF delivery in the hippocampus of LRRK2 knockout mice, suggesting that LRRK2 may contribute to -synuclein-induced neuroinflammation.

Presynaptic modulation plays a crucial role in controlling the excitatory-inhibitory balance within networks. Here, we designed a genetic screen to identify genes involved in the neuromodulation of the C. elegans neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) and identified the orthologs of the Protein Phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit PHACTR1 (phac-1) and the presynaptic phosphoproteins Synapsin (snn-1). Five de novo variants of human PHACTR1 are associated with severe early-onset epilepsies (DEE70). To understand the impact of these variants, we introduced the DEE70 mutations into phac-1. These mutations resulted in the formation of a constitutively active PP1-PHAC-1 holoenzyme that disrupts cholinergic signalling at the NMJ. By using quantitative fluorescence imaging, electron microscopy and electrophysiology, we found that the constitutive holoenzyme alters the synaptic vesicle cycle, reduces the synaptic vesicle reserve pool, and increases neuropeptide release by dense-core vesicles. Notably, while SNN-1 phosphoregulation contributes to NMJ signalling, genetic interactions suggest that SNN-1 is not the main effector of PP1-PHAC-1 holoenzyme signalling. Collectively, our results confirm the pathogenicity of DEE70 variants, clarify their dominant-positive effects, and provide evidence of a presynaptic mode of action for DEE70.",

    "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) form the junction between extracellular matrix (ECM)-bound integrins and the actin cytoskeleton and also transmit signals that regulate cell adhesion, cytoskeletal dynamics, and cell migration. While many of these signals are rooted in reversible tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphorylation of FA proteins on Ser/Thr residues is far more abundant yet its mechanisms and consequences are far less understood. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A; PKA) has important roles in cell adhesion and cell migration and is both an effector and regulator of integrin-mediated adhesion to the ECM. Importantly, subcellular localization plays a critically important role in specifying PKA function. Here, we show that PKA is present in isolated FA-cytoskeleton complexes and, using a targeted biosensor, active within FAs in live cells. Furthermore, using kinase-catalyzed biotinylation of isolated FA-cytoskeleton complexes, we identify fifty-three high-stringency candidate PKA substrates within FAs. From this list, we validate tensin-3 (Tns3) - a well-established molecular scaffold, regulator of cell migration, and component of focal and fibrillar adhesions - as a novel direct substrate for PKA. These observations identify a new pathway for phospho-regulation of Tns3 and, importantly, establish a new and important niche for localized PKA signaling and thus provide a foundation for further investigation of the role of PKA in the regulation of FA dynamics and signaling.",

    "abstract": "Aging proceeds with accumulation of senescent cells in multiple organs. Senescent cells become large in size compared to young cells, which promotes further senescence and age-related diseases. Currently, the molecular mechanism behind the maintenance of such huge cell architecture undergoing senescence remains poorly understood. Here we focus on reorganization of actin stress fibers induced upon replicative senescence of human fibroblasts, typically used as a senescent cell model. We identified, together with our previous proteomic study, that AP2A1 (alpha 1 adaptin subunit of the adaptor protein 2) is upregulated in senescent cells along the length of stress fibers, which are enlarged following the increase in the whole cell size. We then revealed that knockdown of AP2A1 in senescent cells suppresses key senescence-associated phenotypes, which include decreased cell area and lowered expression of major senescence markers. Meanwhile, AP2A1 overexpression in young cells induced the opposite effects that rather advance senescence, suggesting that AP2A1 may be used as a senescence marker. We found that AP2A1 is colocalized with integrin {beta}1, and both of them move linearly along stress fibers. We further observed that focal adhesions are enlarged in senescent cells to reinforce cell adhesions to the substrate. These results suggest that senescent cells maintain their large size by strengthening the anchorage to the substrate by supplying integrin {beta}1 via translocation along stress fibers. This mechanism may work efficiently in senescent cells, compared with a case relying on random diffusion of integrin {beta}1, given the enlarged cell size and resulting increase in travel time and distance for endocytosed vesicle transportation.",

    "abstract": "The human brain is capable of highly complex functions that develops through a tightly organized cascade of patterning events, expressed transcription factors and changes in chromatin accessibility. While extensive datasets exist describing gene expression across the developing brain with single-cell resolution, similar atlases of chromatin accessibility have been primarily focused on the forebrain. Here, we focus on the chromatin landscape and paired gene expression across the developing human brain to provide a comprehensive single cell atlas during the first trimester (6 - 13 post-conceptional weeks). We identified 135 clusters across half a million nuclei and using the multiomic measurements linked candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) to gene expression. We found an increase in the number of accessible regions driven both by age and neuronal differentiation. Using a convolutional neural network we identified putative functional TF-binding sites in enhancers characterizing neuronal subtypes and we applied this model to cCREs upstream of ESRRB to elucidate its activation mechanism. Finally, by linking disease-associated SNPs to cCREs we validated putative pathogenic mechanisms in several diseases and identified midbrain-derived GABAergic neurons as being the most vulnerable to major depressive disorder related mutations. Together, our findings provide a higher degree of detail to some key gene regulatory mechanisms underlying the emergence of cell types during the first trimester. We anticipate this resource to be a valuable reference for future studies related to human neurodevelopment, such as identifying cell type specific enhancers that can be used for highly specific targeting in in vitro models.",

Acto3D features an intuitive interface that simplifies the importation, visualization, and analysis of data sets, has an associated tool for annotation of vascular lumens, and incorporates multiple fluorescence channels for comprehensive imaging. Underpinned by an integrated graphics processing unit, Acto3D allows accurate image reconstruction and efficient data processing without the need for expensive high-performance computers.

Here, we present the derivation and characterization of a panel of distinct clonal embryonic endothelial progenitor cell (eEPC) lines that were differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The hESC line, ESI-017, was first partially differentiated to produce candidate cultures from which eEPC were cloned. Endothelial cell identity was assessed by transcriptomic analysis, cell surface marker expression, immunocytochemical marker analysis, and functional analysis using a vascular network forming assay. The transcriptome of the eEPC lines was compared to various adult endothelial lines as well as various non-endothelial cells including both adult and embryonic origins. This resulted in a variety of distinct cell lines with functional properties of endothelial cells and strong transcriptomic similarity to adult endothelial primary cell lines. The eEPC lines, however, were distinguished from adult endothelium by a novel pattern of embryonic gene expression. We demonstrated scalability of up to 80 population doublings and stable with long-term expansion over 50 passages and stable angiogenic properties at late passage in the EPC line. Taken together, these data support the finding that hESC-derived clonal eEPC lines are useful as a source of scalable therapeutic cells and cell products for treating cardiovascular disease. These eEPC lines offer a highly promising resource for preclinical studies and therapeutic interventions.",

Despite the recent implications of TMEM16F CaPLSase in vascular development and endothelial cell-mediated coagulation, its signaling role in endothelial biology remains to be established. Here, we show that endothelial TMEM16F regulates in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis through intracellular signaling. Developmental retinal angiogenesis is significantly impaired in TMEM16F deficient mice, as evidenced by fewer vascular loops and larger loop areas. Consistent with our in vivo observation, TMEM16F siRNA knockdown in human umbilical vein endothelial cells compromises angiogenesis in vitro. We further discovered that TMEM16F knockdown enhances VE-cadherin phosphorylation and reduces its expression. Moreover, TMEM16F knockdown also promotes Src kinase phosphorylation at tyrosine 416, which may be responsible for downregulating VE-cadherin expression. Our study thus uncovers a new biological function of TMEM16F in angiogenesis and provides a potential mechanism for how the CaPLSase regulates angiogenesis through intracellular signaling.",

Here I use cognitive map theory as the bridge to overcome the gap between spatial and episodic memory. I believe spatial memory is a highly compressed case of episodic memory. In addition, I propose the hypothesis that engram can trigger sharp-wave ripples. I use a spike neural network-based computational model to verify this hypothesis.

Our data suggest that the E protein is a specific dimer, VP4 is exclusively monomeric, and Vpu assembles into a polydisperse mixture of oligomers under these conditions.

    "abstract": "Upon infection, transcriptional shifts in both a host bacterium and its invading phage determine host and viral fitness. The xenobiotic response element (XRE) family of transcription factors (TFs), which are commonly encoded by bacteria and phages, regulate diverse features of bacterial cell physiology and impact phage infection dynamics. Through a pangenome analysis of Caulobacter species isolated from soil and aquatic ecosystems, we uncovered an apparent radiation of a paralogous XRE TF gene cluster, several of which have established functions in the regulation of holdfast adhesin development and biofilm formation in C. crescentus. We further discovered related XRE TFs across the class Alphaproteobacteria and its phages, including the {varphi}CbK Caulophage, suggesting that members of this gene cluster impact host-phage interactions. Here we show that that a closely related group of XRE proteins, encoded by both C. crescentus and {varphi}CbK, can form heteromeric associations and control the transcription of a common gene set, influencing processes including holdfast development and the production of {varphi}CbK virions. The {varphi}CbK XRE paralog, tgrL, is highly expressed at the earliest stages of infection and can directly repress transcription of hfiA, a potent holdfast inhibitor, and gafYZ, a transcriptional activator of prophage-like gene transfer agents (GTAs) encoded on the C. crescentus chromosome. XRE proteins encoded from the C. crescentus chromosome also directly repress gafYZ transcription, revealing a functionally redundant set of host regulators that may protect against spurious production of GTA particles and inadvertent cell lysis. Deleting host XRE transcription factors reduced {varphi}CbK burst size, while overexpressing these genes or {varphi}CbK tgrL rescued this burst defect. We conclude that an XRE TF gene cluster, shared by C. crescentus and {varphi}CbK, plays an important role in adhesion regulation under phage-free conditions, and influences host-phage dynamics during infection.",

    "abstract": "Butyrate is a short chain fatty acid with important industrial applications produced by chemical synthesis. With consumer demand for green products, the fermentative production of butyric acid by microorganisms such as Clostridium is attracting interest. Clostridium butyricum ferments non-digested dietary fibre in the colon to produce butyrate which has multiple health benefits, and certain strains are exploited as probiotics, such as MIYAIRI588 (CBM588). Knowledge of the genes encoding enzymes involved in butyrate production and determining those that are rate-limiting due to low concentrations, could enable strain engineering for higher yields. To this end whole genome sequencing of CBM588 was performed and a circular chromosome, a megaplasmid and the previously reported cryptic plasmid, pCBM588, identified. All genes involved in the butyrate production pathway were found on the chromosome. To identify rate-limiting steps, the relative abundance of the encoded enzymes was assessed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) of total cytosolic proteins. Phosphotransbutyrylase (Ptb) was the least abundant closely followed by butyrate kinase (Buk) and crotonase (Crt). Analysis of upstream regulatory sequences revealed the potential importance of an intact Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Results of this study can now guide bioengineering experiments to improve butyrate yields and enhance the performance of CBM588 as a probiotic.",

    "abstract": "Cobalamin (B12), an essential nutrient and growth cofactor for many living organisms on the Earth, can be fully synthesized only by selected prokaryotes in nature. Therefore, microbial communities related with B12 biosynthesis could serve as an example subsystem to disentangle the underlying ecological mechanisms balancing the function and taxonomy of complex functional assemblages. By anchoring microbial traits potentially involved in B12 biosynthesis, we depict the biogeographic patterns of B12 biosynthesis genes and their carrying taxa in the global ocean, in light of the limitation to detect de novo B12 synthesizers via metagenomes alone. Both the taxonomic and functional composition of B12 biosynthesis genes were strongly shaped by depth, differentiating epipelagic from mesopelagic zones. The functional genes were relatively stably distributed across different oceans, but their carrying taxa varied considerably, showing clear functional redundancy of microbial systems. Microbial taxa carrying B12 biosynthesis genes in the surface water were influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, oxygen and nitrate. However, the composition of functional genes was weakly associated with these environmental factors. Null model analyses demonstrated that determinism governed the compositional variation of B12 biosynthesis genes, whereas a higher degree of stochasticity was associated with taxonomic variations. Significant associations were observed between chlorophyll a concentration and B12 biosynthesis traits, indicating their importance in global ocean primary production. Conclusively, this study revealed an essential ecological mechanism governing the assembly of microbes in nature: the environment selects function rather than taxonomy; functional redundancy underlies stochastic community assembly.\n\nImpact StatementA central question in ecology is how a galaxy of microbial taxa is assembled and distributed across space and through time, executing essential ecosystem functions. By anchoring microbial functional traits potentially involved in B12 biosynthesis and their carrying microbial taxa in the global ocean, this study addresses essential ecological questions from functional and taxonomic angles. Integrating multiple lines of evidence, we show that the ecosystem selects functional traits rather than taxonomic groups, and functional redundancy underlies stochastic taxonomic community assembly. Also, microbial communities potentially involved in B12 biosynthesis are significantly associated with chlorophyll a concentration, demonstrating their importance in global ocean primary production. This study provides valuable mechanistic insights into the complex microbial community assembly in natural ecosystems.",

For the first time, we examined the microbiome of the amphibious plant Eryngium castrense (Apiaceae) inhabiting Mediterranean climate ephemeral wetlands in California. Eryngium castrense has the capacity to survive as both an aquatic and terrestrial plant, thereby living under contrasting extremes of water stress. Whether plant-associated microbial communities are also affected by such changes, and what ecological role they play while inhabiting amphibious plants, is an underexplored topic of plant-microbial interactions in natural and artificial systems. We amplified and sequenced 16S rRNA genes from bacteria and archaea to examine microbial communities associated with roots and shoots over the plants full life cycle. We observed that the microbiome changes from the aquatic stage to the terrestrial stage, and that roots and shoots represent distinct habitats within the plant host ecosystem. When compared with soil and water column samples, plant samples retained a unique, differentiated core microbiome. Taxa located in the roots during the terrestrial stage were linked with potential functions such as nitrogen acquisition, sulfur assimilation, and resistance to heavy metals, whereas aquatic roots held potential phythoparasites.

Specifically, we showed that HCV infection of humanized mice results in the progressive development of HCC. This was true for four genotypes tested (1 to 4). Remarkably, we demonstrated that rencofilstat inhibits the development of HCV-induced HCC in mice even when added 16 weeks post-infection when HCC is well established. Importantly, we showed that rencofilstat drastically reduces HCC progression independently of its anti-HCV activity. Indeed, the CypI rencofilstat inhibits HCC while other anti-HCV agents such as NS5A (NS5Ai) and NS5B (NS5Bi) fail to reduce HCC.

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the microorganisms with high-risk regarding antimicrobial resistance, since it has an overwhelming capacity to acquire antibiotic resistance, mainly by mutations during persistent lung infections. Mutations in mexZ, encoding the local negative regulator of genes encoding the MexXY efflux pump, are very frequently acquired at early stages of P. aeruginosa infections, while they are rarely selected for in vitro. Although traditionally related to resistance to the first-line drug tobramycin, caused by the overproduction of the aminoglycosides MexXY efflux pump, mutations in mexZ are actually associated with low levels of aminoglycosides resistance when determined in the clinical microbiology laboratory. This very moderate but frequent phenotype suggests that these mutations may shape the infection process, beyond causing conventional resistance. Here we investigated the colonization strategy of a mexZ mutant, compared to a wild-type strain, in a human airway infection model. We observed that the mexZ mutant tends to accumulate inside the epithelial cell layer. This behaviour allows bacteria to colonise the epithelium while being more protected against diverse antibiotics. The altered colonization phenotype was caused by the overexpression of lecA, a Quorum Sensing regulated gene encoding a lectin involved in P. aeruginosa tissue invasiveness. lecA upregulation was underlied by the competition for the shared porin, OprM, between the overproduced MexXY and the MexAB efflux pump, responsible for extruding Quorum Sensing molecules. These findings suggest that standardised antimicrobial susceptibility determined in the clinic may be misleading because antibiotic resistance often depends on the infection environment.",

Curiously, both poles contain a membraneless microdomain, established by the polar assembly hub PopZ, through most of the cell cycle, yet many PopZ clients are unipolar and transiently localized. We find that PopZs interaction with the response regulator CpdR is controlled by phosphorylation, via the histidine kinase CckA. Phosphorylated CpdR does not interact with PopZ and is not localized to cell poles. At poles where CckA acts as a phosphatase, de-phosphorylated CpdR binds directly with PopZ and subsequently recruits ClpX, substrates, and other members of a protease complex to the cell pole. We also find that co-recruitment of protease components and substrates to polar microdomains enhances their coordinated activity. This study connects phosphosignaling with polar assembly and the activity of a protease that triggers cell cycle progression and cell differentiation.",

PCC 6803 OCP belongs to the large OCP1 family. Downregulated by the Fluorescence Recovery Protein (FRP) in low-light, high-light-activated OCP1 binds to the phycobilisomes and performs non-photochemical quenching. Recently discovered families OCP2 and OCP3 remain structurally and functionally underexplored, and no systematic comparative studies have ever been conducted. Here we present two first crystal structures of OCP2 from morphoecophysiologically different cyanobacteria and provide their comprehensive structural, spectroscopic and functional comparison with OCP1, the recently described OCP3 and all-OCP ancestor. Structures enable correlation of spectroscopic signatures with the effective number of hydrogen and discovered here chalcogen bonds anchoring the ketocarotenoid in OCP and rationalize the observed differences in OCP/FRP and OCP/phycobilisome functional interactions. These data are expected to foster OCP research and applications in optogenetics, targeted carotenoid delivery and cyanobacterial biomass engineering.",

    "abstract": "U7 snRNA is a 60-nucleotide component of U7 snRNP, a multi-subunit endonuclease that cleaves precursors of metazoan replication-dependent histone mRNAs at the 3 end, hence generating mature histone mRNAs. The Sm site in U7 snRNA differs from the Sm site in spliceosomal snRNAs and promotes the assembly of a unique Sm ring containing Lsm10 and Lsm11 instead of SmD1 and SmD2 found in the spliceosomal snRNPs. The assembly of the spliceosomal Sm ring depends on the SMN complex, with one of its nine subunits, Gemin5, recognizing the spliceosomal Sm site. While the assembly of the U7-specific Sm ring also requires the SMN complex, the unusual Sm site of U7 snRNA is not recognized by Gemin5, and the identity of its counterpart that performs this function in biogenesis of U7 snRNP, has not been determined. Here, we looked for proteins that bind U7 snRNA but not to its mutant altered within the Sm site. We identified Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein 1 (PTBP1) as the main protein that meets this specificity. Binding of PTBP1 to U7 snRNA also depends on the upstream CUCUUU motif that base pairs with histone pre-mRNAs and defines substrate specificity of U7 snRNP. Thus, PTBP1 simultaneously recognizes two functionally essential and highly conserved sites within U7 snRNA. In addition to PTBP1, U7 snRNA interacts with hnRNP A1, which recognizes a different part of the U7-specific Sm site. Interestingly, the two proteins can form with U7 snRNA a larger complex, which also contains SMN protein, a subunit of the SMN complex. Altogether, these results raise the possibility that PTBP1 and hnRNP A1 act collectively to substitute for Gemin5 in the assembly of U7-specific Sm ring.",

    "abstract": "Drp1 is a dynamin family GTPase that is required for mitochondrial and peroxisomal division, in which it oligomerizes into a ring and constricts the underlying membrane in a GTP hydrolysis-dependent manner. Oligomerization increases Drp1 GTPase activity through interactions between neighboring GTPase domains. In cells, Drp1 is regulated by several factors including Drp1 receptors, actin filaments, cardiolipin, and phosphorylation at two sites: S579 and S600. Phosphorylation of S579 is widely regarded as activating, while S600 phosphorylation is commonly considered inhibiting. However, the direct effects of phosphorylation on Drp1 GTPase activity have not been investigated in detail. In this study, we compare the effects of S579 and S600 phosphorylation on purified Drp1, using phospho-mimetic mutants and in vitro phosphorylation. The oligomerization state of both phospho-mimetic mutants is shifted toward smaller oligomers. Both phospho-mimetic mutations maintain basal GTPase activity, but eliminate GTPase stimulation by actin and decrease GTPase stimulation by cardiolipin, Mff, and MiD49. Phosphorylation of S579 by Erk2 produces similar effects. When mixed with wild-type Drp1, both S579D and S600D phospho-mimetic mutants reduce the actin-stimulated GTPase activity of Drp1-WT. Conversely, a Drp1 mutant that lacks GTPase activity, the K38A mutant, stimulates Drp1-WT GTPase activity under both basal and actin-stimulated conditions, similar to previous results for dynamin-1. These results suggest that the effect of S579 phosphorylation is not to activate Drp1 directly, and likely requires additional factors for stimulation of mitochondrial fission in cells. In addition, our results suggest that nearest neighbor interactions within the Drp1 oligomer affect catalytic activity.",

    "abstract": "Keratan sulfate (KS) is a glycosaminoglycan that is widely expressed in the extracellular matrix of various tissue types where it is involved in many biological processes. Herein, we describe a chemo-enzymatic approach to prepare well-defined KS oligosaccharides by exploiting known and newly discovered substrate specificities of relevant sulfotransferases. The premise of the approach is that recombinant GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferases (CHST2) only sulfates terminal GlcNAc moieties to give GlcNAc6S that can be galactosylated by B4GalT4. Furthermore, CHST1 can modify internal galactosides of a poly-LacNAc chain, however, it was found that a GlcNAc6S residue greatly increases the reactivity of CHST1 of a neighboring and internal galactoside. The presence of a 2,3-linked sialoside further modulates the site of modification by CHST1, and a galactoside flanked by 2,3-Neu5Ac and GlcNAc6S is preferentially sulfated over other Gal residues. The substrate specificities of CHST1 and 2 were exploited to prepare a panel of KS oligosaccharides including selectively sulfated N-glycans. The compounds and several other reference derivatives were used to construct a microarray that was probed for binding by several plant lectins, Siglec proteins and hemagglutinins of influenza viruses. It was found that not only the sulfation pattern but also presentation of epitopes as part of an O- or N-glycan determines binding properties.",

    "abstract": "The pathways by which a molecular process transitions to a target state are highly sought-after as direct views of a transition mechanism. While great strides have been made in the physics-based simulation of such pathways, the analysis of these pathways can be a major challenge due to their diversity and variable lengths. Here we present the LPATH Python tool, which implements a semi-automated method for linguistics-assisted clustering of pathways into distinct classes (or routes). This method involves three steps: 1) discretizing the configurational space into key states, 2) extracting a text-string sequence of key visited states for each pathway, and 3) pairwise matching of pathways based on a text-string similarity score. To circumvent the prohibitive memory requirements of the first step, we have implemented a general two-stage method for clustering conformational states that exploits machine learning. LPATH is primarily designed for use with the WESTPA software for weighted ensemble simulations; however, the tool can also be applied to conventional simulations. As demonstrated for the C7eq to C7ax conformational transition of alanine dipeptide, LPATH provides physically reasonable classes of pathways and corresponding probabilities.",

These liquid-like droplets have some of the lowest interfacial tension ([~]25 pN/m) but high zero-shear viscosities (1-15 Pa s) due to the bridged protein networks, and yet their fusion has some of the highest speeds ([~]1 m/ms). The rapid fusion manifests extreme shear thinning, where the apparent viscosity is lower than zero-shear viscosity by over 100-fold, made possible by fast reformation of the ATP bridges.

Despite some chemical-based methods, biological phosphorus removal using polyphosphate-accumulating organisms, such as microalgae, serves as a sustainable alternative to reclaim phosphate from wastewater. Polyphosphates have profound biological functions and biomedical applications, serving as energy stock, coagulation factors, and antiviral agents depending on their length, showing inherent value in polyphosphate recovery. Here, we leveraged the power of thermodynamic coupling and phase transitions to establish a one-pot, two-step multi-enzyme cascade to convert polydisperse polyphosphate in microalgae biomass into high-molecular-weight insoluble long-chain polyphosphates, allowing for one-step purification. We then optimzed a thermo-digestion approach to transform the 1,300-mers into shorter polyphosphates. Altogether, the processes established here enable the establishment of a sustainable P bioeconomy platform to refine microalgal biomass for biotechnological uses.",

    "abstract": "Engineered sex ratio distorters (SRDs) have been proposed as a powerful component of both self-limiting and self-sustaining genetic control strategies designed to suppress harmful insect pest or disease vector populations such as malaria mosquitoes. Two different CRISPR-based SRD mechanisms, X-shredding which eliminates X-bearing sperm in males and X-poisoning which causes postzygotic mortality of daughters inheriting disrupted X-linked genes, have been proposed. The nature of the sex distortion mechanism is predicted to affect the population dynamics of released Y-chromosome SRDs: A Y-linked X-shredder is invasive constituting a classical meiotic Y-drive, whereas Y-linked X-poisoning is self-limiting, unable to invade but also insulated from selection and disappearance. Here, we established the first X-poisoning SRD system in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae targeting three X-linked ribosomal protein (RP) genes during spermatogenesis. Surprisingly, when we characterized transgenic strains showing a significant male bias, we found that sex distortion was primarily driven by a loss of X-bearing sperm with limited evidence for postzygotic lethality of daughters. By leveraging the Drosophila model, we show unambiguously that engineered SRD traits can operate differently in these two insects. Unlike X-shredding, X-poisoning could theoretically operate at early stages of spermatogenesis. We therefore explored premeiotic Cas9 expression to target the mosquito X-chromosome. We find that, by pre-empting the onset of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation, this approach may enable the development of Y-linked SRDs, once trade-offs between sex chromosome transmission distortion and male fertility are functionally balanced.",

In part, this might be attributed to the interaction of the intestinal microbiome with xenobiotics. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of common CD drugs on the patients microbiome in vitro.\n\nMethodsThe fecal microbiome of each of 5 CD patients was exposed to 42 g/ml budesonide, 55 g/ml 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), 5 or 15 g/ml tofacitinib, or DMSO-control in defined culture medium in an anaerobic chamber at 37{degrees}C for 24 hours. Subsequently, DNA and proteins were isolated and subjected to 16 rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and LC-MS proteomic analysis, respectively.\n\nResultsMetagenomic and metaproteomic analyses revealed larger differences between donors than between drug exposures. Exposure to 6-MP and tofacitinib resulted in a significant alteration in the metaproteome when compared to the control condition, whereas no effect could be observed for budesonide. Applying a stringent selection, 33 proteins were more abundant and 93 less abundant in all 6-MP cultures and could thereby discriminate clearly between 6-MP and control. In contrast to metaproteomic analyses, metagenomic analyses only detected a lower relative abundance of Colidextribacter in 15 g/ml tofacitinib cultures, but not in overall richness, diversity or community structure.\n\nConclusionTofacitinib and especially 6-MP clearly affect microbial function, but barely microbial composition in vitro. These drug-induced functional changes may subsequently influence host physiology and potentially inflammation in CD. Our findings emphasize the relevance to include functional microbial studies when investigating drug-microbiota interactions. Further research needs to elucidate the impact of 6-MP-induced microbial alterations on intestinal physiology and inflammation in CD.",

Decreased Hippo pathway activity leads to nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ where they interact with TEAD transcription factors to induce target gene expression. Unrestrained YAP/TAZ activity can lead to excessive growth and tumor formation in a short time, underscoring the evolutionary need for tight control of these two transcriptional coactivators. The AP-1 complex binds together with YAP/TAZ to many common sites and they form a positive feed-forward to induce gene expression.\n\nHere, we report that the AP-1 component c-JUN acts as specific repressor of YAP/TAZ at joint target sites to decrease YAP/TAZ activity. This function of c-JUN is independent of its heterodimeric AP-1 partner c-FOS demonstrating that it is independent of the canonical AP-1 function to induce target gene expression. Since c-JUN is itself by YAP/TAZ, our work identifies a negative feedback loop that buffers YAP/TAZ activity at joint sites. This negative feedback loop needs to get disrupted in liver cancer to unlock the full oncogenic potential of YAP/TAZ.\n\nOur results thus demonstrate an additional layer of control for the important interplay of YAP/TAZ and AP-1.",

    "abstract": "ABCB7 deficiency during chronic cardiac hypertrophy contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic shift and worsens cardiac function. Here, we explored that ABCB7 deficiency contribute to tethering of mito-ER and in turn mitochondrial dysfunction in H9c2 cells. We also investigated the mechanistic link between mitochondrial dysfunction and ABCB7 deficiency in these cells. Knockdown of ABCB7 was performed by siABCB7 plasmids or control vectors using lipofectamine 2000. To rescue the changes produced by siABCB7, ABCB7 overexpression was performed using ABCB7 overexpression vector. After knockdown or overexpression, cells were harvested for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), RT-PCR or Immunofluorescence analysis. Knockdown of ABCB7 in H9C2 cells resulted in enhanced tethering of mito.-ER contact sites, and increased mito.-ER distance. To our surprise, the downregulation of ABCB7 did not alter the cristae structure or morphology in these cells. On the mechanistic front, Knockdown of ABCB7 in H9C2 cells MTOR-independent AMPK-dependent macroautophagic/autophagic flux. ABCB7 downregulation did not result in cell death in these cells; this phenomenon could work independent of cell death in H9c2 cells.",

    "abstract": "A series of \"molecular domestication\" events are thought to have converted an invertebrate RAG-like (RAGL) transposase into the RAG1-RAG2 (RAG) recombinase, a critical enzyme for adaptive immunity in jawed vertebrates. The timing and order of these events is not well understood, in part because of a dearth of information regarding the invertebrate RAGL-A transposon family. In contrast to the abundant and divergent RAGL-B transposon family, RAGL-A most closely resembles RAG and is represented by a single orphan RAG1-like (RAG1L) gene in the genome of the hemichordate Ptychodera flava (PflRAG1L-A). Here, we provide evidence for the existence of complete RAGL-A transposons in the genomes of P. flava and several echinoderms. The predicted RAG1L-A and RAG2L-A proteins encoded by these transposons intermingle sequence features of jawed vertebrate RAG and RAGL-B transposases, leading to a prediction of DNA binding, catalytic, and transposition activities that are a hybrid of RAG and RAGL-B. Similarly, the terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) of the RAGL-A transposons combine features of both RAGL-B transposon TIRs and RAG recombination signal sequences. Unlike all previously described RAG2L proteins, PflRAG2L-A and echinoderm RAG2L-A contain an acidic hinge region, which we demonstrate is capable of efficiently inhibiting RAG-mediated transposition. Our findings provide evidence for a critical intermediate in RAG evolution and argue that certain adaptations thought to be specific to jawed vertebrates (e.g., the RAG2 acidic hinge) actually arose in invertebrates, thereby focusing attention on other adaptations as the pivotal steps in the completion of RAG domestication in jawed vertebrates.",

Towards this goal, we measured 147,153 pairwise interactions among genes implicated in PARP inhibitor (PARPi) response. Evaluating genetic interactions at this scale, with and without exposure to PARPi, revealed hierarchical organization of the pathways and complexes that maintain genome stability during normal growth and defined changes that occur upon accumulation of DNA lesions due to cytotoxic doses of PARPi. We uncovered unexpected relationships among DNA repair genes, including context-specific buffering interactions between the minimally characterized AUNIP and BRCA1-A complex genes. Our work thus establishes a foundation for mapping differential genetic interactions in mammalian cells and provides a comprehensive resource for future studies of DNA repair and PARP inhibitors.",

Here, we describe a modular splicing architecture that leverages in vitro-derived RNA affinity models for 79 human RBPs and the annotated human genome to produce improved models of RBP binding and activity. Binding and activity are modeled by separate Motif and Aggregator components that can be mixed and matched, enforcing sparsity to improve interpretability. Standard affinity models yielded reasonable predictions, but substantial improvements resulted from using a new Adjusted Motif (AM) architecture. While maintaining accurate modeling of in vitro binding, training these AMs on the splicing task yielded improved predictions of binding sites in vivo and of splicing activity, using independent crosslinking and massively parallel splicing reporter assay data. The modular structure of our model enables improved generalizability to other species (insects, plants) and to exons of different evolutionary ages.",

In addition to peripheral tissues, T2D also impacts the central nervous system leading to neurocognitive impairments, including memory deficits, anxiety, and depression. The metabolic determinants of these neurocognitive impairments remain unidentified. Here, we used a novel proprietary high-fat diet, in which glucose intolerance precedes weight gain, to decipher the metabolic determinants of neurocognitive affects. We show that this model exhibits anxiety-like behaviors, without eliciting depression nor recognition memory deficits. Long-term feeding leads to weight gain, brain glucose hypometabolism and impaired recognition memory alongside the early onset anxiety-like behavior. Using an established genetic model of T2D (db/db) and of diet-induced obesity we show that additional insulin resistance and obesity are associated with depressive-like behaviors and recognition memory deficits. Our findings indicate that glucose intolerance alone can elicit anxiety-like behaviors. Through this study we also provide a novel nutritional model to characterize the discrete effects of glucose intolerance on cognition, behavior, and the physiology of metabolic disease.",

    "abstract": "Mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) is a key signaling protein of necroptosis. MLKL oligomerizes and translocates to the plasma membrane upon phosphorylation by the necrosome. At the plasma membrane, MLKL induces membrane permeabilization which contributes to the inflammatory activity of necroptosis. Membrane binding of MLKL oligomers is initially initiated by the electrostatic interaction between the protein and membrane phospholipids. We have previously showed that MLKL and its phosphorylated form (pMLKL) are S-acylated during necroptosis and that this acylation increases their membrane binding. In this work, we characterize acylation sites of MLKL and identify multiple cysteines that can undergo acylation with an interesting promiscuity at play. Our results show that MLKL and pMLKL undergo monoacylation, with C184, C269 and C286 being the possible acylation sites. In other words, while there are multiple cysteines that are accessible for acylation, the acylation predominantly occurs at a single cysteine. The molecular interactions that determine the exact acylation site remain unclear. Investigating the S-palmitoyltransferases that might acylate MLKL in necroptosis, we showed that zDHHC21 activity has the strongest effect on pMLKL acylation and reducing the activity of zDHHC21 significantly improved membrane integrity of necroptotic cells. We also observed that inactivation of zDHHC21 reduced the pMLKL levels in the cells, suggesting that blocking the acylation of pMLKL results in reduced membrane binding, destabilization of the protein at the membrane interface and cause its degradation. Finally, through molecular dynamics simulations, we verify the acyl tail of MLKL can insert into the membrane and causes conformational changes to the protein and lipid re-organization of the membrane. At a broader level, our findings shed light onto pMLKL processing and the effect of S-acylation on pMLKL functioning in necroptosis.",

    "abstract": "Portable sample-to-answer devices with applications in point-of-care settings have emerged to obviate the necessity of centralized laboratories for biomarker analysis. In this work, a smartphone-operated and additively manufactured multiplexed electrochemical device (AMMED) is presented for the portable detection of biomarkers in blood and saliva. AMMED is comprised of a customized portable potentiostat with a multiplexing feature, a 3D-printed sample collection cartridge to handle three samples of saliva and blood at the same time, a smartphone application to remotely control the potentiostat, and a 3D-printed-based multiplexed microfluidic electrochemical biosensor (test chip). Here, by employing additive manufacturing techniques, a simple, cleanroom-free, and scalable approach was proposed for the fabrication of the test chip. Moreover, these techniques can bring about easy integration of AMMED components. Additionally, the test chip can be compatible with different affinity-based bioassays which can be implemented in a multiplexed manner for detection. The AMMED components were successfully characterized in terms of electrochemical and fluidic performance. Particularly, to demonstrate the biosensing capabilities of the device, the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant and a well-established aptameric assay were selected as the representative biomarker and the bioassay, respectively. The proposed device accurately and selectively detected the target of interest in a rapid (5 min) and multiplex manner with a dynamic detection range of 1-10,000 pg. ml-1 in different media; and the clinical feasibility was assessed by several saliva patient samples. AMMED offers a versatile sample-to-answer platform that can be used for the detection of various biomarkers present in biofluids.",

The ''Archaean Domes '' (DA) in the CCB are hypersaline, non-lithifying microbial mats. This study focused on analyzing the small domes and circular structures formed in DA through metagenome assembly genomes (MAGs) with the aim of finding new microorganisms and providing information on the tree of life in a place as diverse as the CCB. In total, 329 MAGs were identified, including 52 archaea and 277 bacteria. Remarkably, 30 Archaea and 154 Bacteria could not be classified at the genus level, highlighting the remarkable diversity of CCB. The CCBs showed significant diversity at the phylum level, with Proteobacteria being the most abundant, followed by Euryarchaeota, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Spirochaetes, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, Candidatus Parvarchaeota, Verrucomicrobia, Balneolaeota, Nitrospirae, and Tenericutes. Subsequently, the MAGs were classified into a phylogenetic tree. In Archaea, monophyletic groups MAGs belonged to the phyla Archaeoglobi, Candidatus Aenigmarchaeota, Candidatus Nanoarchaeota, Candidatus Lokiarchaeota, and Halobacteriota. Among the Bacteria, monophyletic groups were identified as well, including Spirochaetes, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetota, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobiota, Bacteroidetes, Bipolaricaulota, Desulfobacterota, and Cyanobacteria. These monophyletic clusters may indicate radiation events that are likely influenced by geographical isolation as well as extreme environmental conditions reported in AD pond like phosphorus deficiency (122:42:1 C:N:P), fluctuating pH and a salinity of 5.28%",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMisfolded -synuclein (-syn) is believed to contribute to neurodegeneration in Lewy body disease (LBD) based on considerable evidence including a gene-dosage effect observed in relation to point mutations and multiplication of SNCA in familial Parkinsons disease. A contradictory concept proposes early loss of the physiological -syn as the major driver of neurodegeneration. There is a paucity of data on SNCA transcripts in various -syn immunoreactive cytopathologies.\n\nMethodsSNCA transcripts in neurons without and with various -syn immunoreactive cytopathologies in the substantia nigra and amygdala in LBD (n = 5) were evaluated using RNAscope combined with immunofluorescence for disease-associated -syn. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing was performed to elucidate cell-type specific SNCA expression in non-diseased frontal cortex (n = 3).\n\nResultsSNCA transcripts in neurons with punctate -syn immunoreactivity were preserved both in the substantia nigra and amygdala but were reduced in neurons with compact -syn inclusions. Only single SNCA transcripts were detected in astrocytes with or without -syn immunoreactivity in the amygdala. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that excitatory and inhibitory neurons, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocytes, and homeostatic microglia expressed SNCA transcripts, while expression was largely absent in astrocytes and microglia.\n\nConclusionsThe preserved cellular SNCA expression in the more abundant non-Lewy body type -syn cytopathologies provides a pool for local protein production that can aggregate and serve as a seed for misfolded -syn. Successful segregation of disease-associated -syn is associated with the exhaustion of SNCA production in the terminal cytopathology, the Lewy body. Our observations support a therapeutic strategy incorporating a finely tuned dual approach targeting the elimination of misfolded -syn along with the reduction of the SNCA transcription to avoid feeding of pathological -syn seeding.",

The reasons for these marked differences in sensitivity are presently unknown. The objective of this research was to explore potential toxicokinetic drivers of species sensitivity by characterizing biliary metabolites of 6PPD-Q in sensitive and tolerant fishes. For the first time, we identified an O-glucuronide metabolite of 6PPD-Q using high-resolution mass spectrometry. The semi-quantified levels of this metabolite in tolerant species or life stages, including white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkia lewisi) and non-fry life stages of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), were greater than those in sensitive species, including coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), suggesting that tolerant species might more effectively detoxify 6PPD-Q. Thus, we hypothesize that differences in species sensitivity are a result of differences in basal expression of biotransformation enzyme across various fish species. Moreover, the semi-quantification of 6PPD-Q metabolites in bile extracted from wild-caught fish might be a useful biomarker of exposure to 6PPD-Q, thereby being invaluable to environmental monitoring and risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Protein Kinase A; PKA) is a ubiquitous, promiscuous kinase whose activity is focused and specified through subcellular localization mediated by A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). PKA has complex roles as both an effector and a regulator of integrin-mediated cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Recent observations demonstrate that PKA is an active component of focal adhesions (FA), intracellular complexes coupling ECM-bound integrins to the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting the existence of one or more FA AKAPs. Using a combination of a promiscuous biotin ligase fused to PKA type-II regulatory (RII) subunits and subcellular fractionation, we identify the archetypal FA protein talin1 as an AKAP. Talin is a large, mechanosensitive scaffold that directly links integrins to actin filaments and promotes FA assembly by recruiting additional components in a force-dependent manner. The rod region of talin1 consists of 62 -helices bundled into 13 rod domains, R1-R13. Direct binding assays and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy identify helix41 in the R9 subdomain of talin as the PKA binding site. PKA binding to helix41 requires unfolding of the R9 domain, which requires the linker region between R9 and R10. Finally, single-molecule experiments with talin1 and PKA, and experiments in cells manipulated to alter actomyosin contractility demonstrate that the PKA-talin interaction is regulated by mechanical force across the talin molecule. These observations identify the first mechanically-gated anchoring protein for PKA, a new force-dependent binding partner for talin1, and thus a new mechanism for coupling cellular tension and signal transduction.",

We previously showed, in vivo, that platelet activation revealed by intracellular calcium mobilization was a crucial step in the growth of thrombi following laser-induced injury, a model of thromboinflammation.\n\nAimWe employed a multimodal, correlative microscopy approach and computational biology to investigate the extent of platelet activation and the spatial distribution of platelets throughout a growing thrombus.\n\nResultsWe observed a reversible intracellular platelet calcium mobilization that correlates with the time a platelet resides during thrombus growth. Our bioinformatics analysis displayed three distinct platelet subpopulations resident within a thrombus: (1) resting, (2) partially activated, and (3) \"fully\" activated platelets. The spatial distribution of the platelet subpopulations in the thrombus creates a double gradient in both the transversal and longitudinal axis, with the maximal percentage of fully activated platelets close to the site of injury. However, these activated platelets did not express negative phospholipids. The injured endothelium was identified to play a vital role in activating the blood coagulation cascade in this model of thrombosis.\n\nConclusionFollowing a laser-induced injury, thrombi are formed by a gradient of activated platelets from the injury site to the periphery of the thrombus.

    "abstract": "Many of the worlds most devastating crop diseases are caused by fungal pathogens which elaborate specialized infection structures to invade plant tissue. Here we present a quantitative mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic analysis of infection-related development by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, which threatens global food security. We mapped 8,005 phosphosites on 2,062 fungal proteins, revealing major re-wiring of phosphorylation-based signaling cascades during fungal infection. Comparing phosphosite conservation across 41 fungal species reveals phosphorylation signatures specifically associated with biotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungal infection. We then used parallel reaction monitoring to identify phosphoproteins directly regulated by the Pmk1 MAP kinase that controls plant infection by M. oryzae. We define 33 substrates of Pmk1 and show that Pmk1-dependent phosphorylation of a newly identified regulator, Vts1, is required for rice blast disease. Defining the phosphorylation landscape of infection therefore identifies potential therapeutic interventions for control of plant diseases.",
