    "abstract": "BackgroundGlioblastoma (GB) is an incurable malignant tumor of the central nervous system, with a poor prognosis. Robust molecular biomarkers associated with therapeutic response or survival are still lacking in GB. Previously, using NADH-fluorescence lifetime imaging (NADH-FLIM), as a new drug screening precision medicine ex-vivo approach, we categorized patient-derived vital tumors into TMZ responder (Resp) and non-responder (Non-Resp) groups, revealing differentially expressed genes.\n\nMethodsExpanding on our previous study, we assessed TMZ response in a larger cohort of primary and recurrent ex-vivo live GB tumors (n=33) using NADH-FLIM. Transcriptome analysis was performed to characterize TMZ Resp and Non-Resp cases, and in-silico and functional cellular investigations were conducted to explore the efficacy of potential biomarkers.\n\nResultsGenes dysregulated in the previous study showed consistent expression patterns. BIRC3, a potent apoptosis inhibitor, was significantly upregulated in TMZ-resistant samples. BIRC3 expression complemented MGMT status as a prognostic factor in multiple TCGA cohorts. BIRC3 functioned as a prognostic factor of survival also in separate European private glioblastoma cohorts. The BIRC3 antagonist, AZD5582, in combination with TMZ, effectively reversed TMZ resistance by restoring apoptosis in glioblastoma cell lines and patient-derived organoids.\n\nConclusionsBIRC3 holds promise as a prognostic biomarker and predictor of TMZ response in GB. Assessing BIRC3 expression could aid in stratifying patients for combined TMZ and AZD5582 therapy. Our study highlights the potential of functional precision medicine and BIRC3 assessment as a standard tool in glioblastoma clinical oncology, improving outcomes.\n\nKEYPOINTSO_LIBIRC3, previously overlooked, identified through dynamic precision medicine using TMZ perturbation of glioblastoma tissue as a robust prognostic factor.\nC_LIO_LIThe gene BIRC3 is an independent prognostic factor associated with shorter survival and TMZ resistance, rigorously validated across various case studies and datasets, including two expansive European case studies.\nC_LIO_LIProposal of anti-BIRC3 drug, AZD5582, shows promise as a novel therapeutic option to overcome TMZ resistance in GB tumors, providing hope for improved outcomes and personalized treatment strategies for patients with limited treatment options\nC_LI\n\nIMPORTANCE OF THE STUDYGlioblastoma (GB), an aggressive cancer type with a bleak prognosis, lacks dependable biomarkers for treatment prediction. Few markers like MGMT promoter methylation, IDH1 mutation, TERT gene mutations, and EGFR amplification are known, but their predictive consistency varies. Temozolomide (TMZ) resistance, seen in over 50% of GB patients, complicates matters. BIRC3, an apoptosis-inhibiting gene, displays heightened expression in TMZ-resistant tumors. Our study examined BIRC3 in GB patient samples, finding it an independent prognostic factor linked to shorter survival and TMZ resistance. Our research builds upon Wang et al.s 2016 and 2017 findings, delving deeper through TCGA data and European case studies. BIRC3s consistent prominence suggests its significance, with functional experiments confirming its role. We assessed AZD5582, targeting BIRC3, which, when combined with TMZ, curtailed cell growth and induced apoptosis. Notably, AZD5582 countered TMZ resistance in patient-derived GB-EPXs, except for low BIRC3 cases. Our precision medicine approach enhances personalized therapies and outcomes, highlighting BIRC3s potential as a prognostic marker and AZD5582 as a new therapy for TMZ-resistant GB.",

    "abstract": "Caspase-2, one of the most evolutionarily conserved member of the caspase family, is an important regulator of the cellular response to oxidative stress. Given that ferroptosis is suppressed by antioxidant defense pathways, such as that involving selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), we hypothesised that caspase-2 may play a role in regulating ferroptosis. This study provides the first demonstration of an important and unprecedented function of caspase-2 in protecting cancer cells from undergoing ferroptotic cell death. Specifically, we show that depletion of caspase-2 leads to downregulation of stress response genes including SESN2, HMOX1, SLC7A11 and sensitises mutant-p53 cancer cells to cell death induced by various ferroptosis inducing compounds. Importantly, the canonical catalytic activity of caspase-2 is not required for its role and suggests that caspase-2 regulates ferroptosis via non-proteolytic interaction with other proteins. Using an unbiased BioID proteomics screen, we identified novel caspase-2 interacting proteins (including heat shock proteins and co-chaperones) that regulate cellular responses to stress. Finally, we demonstrate that caspase-2 limits chaperone mediated autophagic degradation of GPX4 to promote survival of mutant-p53 cancer cells. In conclusion, we document a novel role for caspase-2 as a negative regulator of ferroptosis in cells with mutant-p53. Our results provide evidence for a novel function of caspase-2 functions in cell death regulation and open potential new avenues to exploit ferroptosis in cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCellulose degradation by cellulases has been studied for decades due to the potential of using lignocellulosic biomass as a sustainable source of bioethanol. In plant cell walls, cellulose is bonded together and strengthened by the polyphenolic polymer, lignin. Because lignin is tightly linked to cellulose and is not digestible by cellulases, is thought to play a dominant role in limiting the efficient enzymatic degradation of plant biomass. Removal of lignin via pretreatments currently limits the cost-efficient production of ethanol from cellulose, motivating the need for a better understanding of how lignin inhibits cellulase-catalyzed degradation of lignocellulose. Work to date using bulk assays has suggested three possible inhibition mechanisms: lignin blocks access of the enzyme to cellulose, lignin impedes progress of the enzyme along cellulose, or lignin binds cellulases directly and acts as a sink.\n\nResultsWe used single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to investigate the nanoscale dynamics of Cel7A from Trichoderma reesei, as it binds to and moves along purified bacterial cellulose in vitro. Lignified cellulose was generated by polymerizing coniferyl alcohol onto purified bacterial cellulose, and the degree of lignin incorporation into the cellulose meshwork was analyzed by optical and electron microscopy. We found that Cel7A preferentially bound to regions of cellulose where lignin was absent, and that in regions of high lignin density, Cel7A binding was inhibited. With increasing degrees of lignification, there was a decrease in the fraction of Cel7A that moved along cellulose rather than statically binding. Furthermore, with increasing lignification, the velocity of processive Cel7A movement decreased, as did the distance that individual Cel7A molecules moved during processive runs.\n\nConclusionsIn an in vitro system that mimics lignified cellulose in plant cell walls, lignin did not act as a sink to sequester Cel7A and prevent it from interacting with cellulose. Instead, lignin both blocked access of Cel7A to cellulose and impeded the processive movement of Cel7A along cellulose. This work implies that strategies for improving biofuel production efficiency should target weakening interactions between lignin and cellulose surface, and further suggest that nonspecific adsorption of Cel7A to lignin is likely not a dominant mechanism of inhibition.",

    "abstract": "The development of multi-cellular organisms requires coordinated changes in gene expression that are often mediated by the interaction between transcription factors (TFs) and their corresponding cis-regulatory elements (CREs). During development and differentiation, the accessibility of CREs is dynamically modulated by the epigenome. How the epigenome, CREs and TFs together exert control over cell fate commitment remains to be fully understood. In the Arabidopsis leaf epidermis, meristemoids undergo a series of stereotyped cell divisions, then switch fate to commit to stomatal differentiation. Newly created or reanalyzed scRNA-seq and ChIP-seq data confirm that stomatal development involves distinctive phases of transcriptional regulation and that differentially regulated genes are bound by the stomatal basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Targets of the bHLHs often reside in repressive chromatin before activation. MNase-seq evidence further suggests that the repressive state can be overcome and remodeled upon activation by specific stomatal bHLHs. We propose that chromatin remodeling is mediated through the recruitment of a set of physical interactors that we identified through proximity labeling - the ATPase-dependent chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex and the histone acetyltransferase HAC1. The bHLHs and chromatin remodelers localize to overlapping genomic regions in a hierarchical order. Furthermore, plants with stage-specific knock-down of the SWI/SNF components or HAC1 fail to activate specific bHLH targets and display stomatal development defects. Together these data converge on a model for how stomatal TFs and epigenetic machinery cooperatively regulate transcription and chromatin remodeling during progressive fate specification.",

    "abstract": "Plant phenotyping involves the quantitative determination of complex plant traits using image analysis. One important parameter is how green plant tissues appear to the observer, which is indicative of their health and developmental stage. Various formulas have been developed to quantify this by calculating leaf greenness scores. We have developed a revised formula called \"Green Index\" (GI) devised out of the need to quantitatively assess how the apparent greenness of seedlings changes during de-etiolation. The GI calculation is simple, uses widely available RGB values of pixels in images as input, and does not require commercial software platforms or advanced computational skills. In this study we describe the conception of the GI formula, compare it with other widely used greenness formulas, and test its wider application in plant phenotyping using the open source free software platform RawTherapee. We demonstrate the utility of the GI in addressing common issues encountered in assessing plant biology experiments, underscoring its potential as a reliable and accessible tool. Finally, we explore the correlation between GI and chlorophyll content, assess its reliance on different types of photography, and summarizes the key steps for its effective utilization.",

    "abstract": "Achieving sustainable chemical synthesis and a circular economy will require process innovation to minimize or recover existing waste streams. Valorization of lignin biomass has the ability to advance this goal. While lignin has proved a recalcitrant feedstock for upgrading, biological approaches can leverage native microbial metabolism to simplify complex and heterogeneous feedstocks to tractable starting points for biochemical upgrading. Recently, we demonstrated that one microbe with lignin relevant metabolism, Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, is both highly engineerable and capable of undergoing rapid design-build-test-learn cycles, making it an ideal candidate for these applications. Here, we utilize these genetic traits and ADP1s native {beta}-ketoadipate metabolism to convert mock alkali pretreated liquor lignin (APL) to two valuable natural products, vanillin-glucoside and resveratrol. En route, we create strains with up to 22 genetic modifications, including up to 8 heterologously expressed enzymes. Our approach takes advantage of preexisting aromatic species in APL (vanillate, ferulate, and p-coumarate) to create shortened biochemical routes to end products. Together, this work demonstrates ADP1s potential as a platform for upgrading lignin waste streams and highlights the potential for biosynthetic methods to maximize the existing chemical potential of lignin aromatic monomers.",

    "abstract": "CO2 recycle is crucial to the global carbon neutrality. Though cyanobacteria are known to be photoautotrophic cell factories capable of converting CO2 into valuable chemicals, their slower growth rate and lower biomass accumulation compared to those of the heterotrophic organisms significantly restrict their application at commercial scale. The newly discovered marine cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp. PCC 11901 (hereafter PCC 11901) offers several advantages like rapid growth, high biomass and high salinity tolerance, and could become a new generation of cyanobacterial chassis. To promote its application, in this study we developed genetic toolboxes applicable to PCC 11901. First, a cobalamin (VB12)-independent chassis was constructed, allowing for its cheaper cultivation. Second, genome copy numbers and transformation methods were respectively measured and optimized. The 14 neutral sites were identified and characterized within the genome PCC 11901, providing locations for genetic integration of exogenous cassettes. Subsequently, libraries were developed, reaching an expression range of approximately 800 folds for constitutive promoters and an induction fold of up to approximately 400 for inducible promotor, respectively. As a proof of concept of its utilization, we engineered the synthetic pathways of glucosylglycerol (GG) into PCC 11901 using the established toolboxes, yielding about 590.41 mg/L for GG production. Notably, we found the cobalamin-independent PCC 11901 chassis exhibited superior self-sedimentation ability compared to the wild-type chassis.

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic metabolism is organized into subcellular compartments enclosed by lipid-membranes. Since most metabolites do not move freely across the membranes, the compartmentalization influences metabolic pathway connectivities. Thus, compartmentalizing the pathways also in genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) is essential for accurate predictions of eukaryotic cells metabolic phenotypes. Compartmentalization has manually been introduced into the model Eukaryote GEMs like for yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Non-model organisms GEMs can be automatically reconstructed from genome data. However, the existing GEM reconstruction methods do not introduce compartmentalization into the models. To that end, we integrated our novel deep learning protein localization prediction and protein functional annotation into a top-down GEM reconstruction for automatically creating species-specific compartmentalized GEMs. We developed also a universal fungal GEM for top-down reconstruction of species-specifically compartmentalized GEMs and reconstructed models for 834 species. The novel protein localization prediction outperformed the state of the art in classifying proteins into multiple compartments and integrating the enzyme localization predictions to functional annotations improved the top-down model reconstruction. Interestingly, the clustering of the fungal GEMs reconstructed with predicted species-specific enzyme localization resembled more closely the phylogenetic relationships of the species than that of the GEMS without the compartmentalization. Compartmentalization of metabolism in fungi differs from other eukaryotes but the enzyme subcellular localizations vary also among fungal species. The Fungal kingdom encompasses species important for human health, environment, and industrial biotechnology. The reconstructed fungal GEM set offers valuable tools for e.g., predicting metabolic phenotypes of e.g., mushrooms or single-cellular fungi, the roles of eukaryotes in microbial communities, designs optimizing eukaryotic hosts for industrial chemical production, and identifying drug targets against pathogenic fungi. Beyond fungi, the compartmentalized GEM reconstruction method allows combining other universal GEMs for developing cell type specific GEMs for higher eukaryotes including plants, insects, and mammals.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe global distribution of parasitoid wasp species richness is poorly known. Past attempts to compare data from different sites have been hampered by small sample sizes and lack of standardisation. During the past decades, we have carried out long-term Malaise trapping using a standardised approach in the tropical forests of Peru (western Amazonia) and Uganda (eastern Africa). Here, we test how well such data can be used for global comparisons, by comparing the results for the subfamily Rhyssinae (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae). We found that more rhyssine species were caught in Peru than in Uganda, despite the Ugandan samples containing many more individuals both in absolute terms and per unit time. The difference in the number of individuals caught may largely be due to more rainfall in Peru, since rain reduces Malaise trap catches. Peruvian traps caught species at a faster rate (per individual caught) than Ugandan traps. We interpret this as a sign that the Peruvian sites have more species than the Ugandan site. Long-term, standardised Malaise trapping showed promise for global comparisons of species richness. Sampling more sites on both continents, and analysing all subfamilies, would give an estimate of which continent has more parasitoid wasp species. We suggest some refinements to the sampling design that would further improve sampling efficiency for future studies.",

    "abstract": "The Southern Rocky Mountain Boreal Toad (Anaxyrus boreas boreas) is an ex situ managed species which relies heavily on the use of assisted reproductive technologies to augment existing in situ populations. Despite the use of ARTs to manipulate reproduction of this species, the ex situ program continues to face challenges with annual reproduction. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at 10 IU/gbw singly or in combination with 0.4 ug/gbw GnRH-A have been successfully reported for this species, however, with a number of other available hormones, it is not clear if these are the most effective protocols for this species. Moreover, there is no information on how exogenous hormone administration is affected by other factors such as seasonality. Therefore, in the first part of this study, we compare the efficacy of the 10 IU/g hCG and 0.4 Lg/g Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone agonist (GnRH-A) administered singly or in combination, as well as GnRH-Apd + Amphiplex (0.4 Lg/g GnRH-A + 10 Lg/g Metoclopramide [MET] - a dopamine antagonist), or 10 Lg/g MET alone. Spermiation responses and sperm viability were compared across treatments with hormonal curves then correlated to seasonality. The results of this study suggest that the optimal hormonal stimulation protocol, across all treatments, in terms of sperm quality was 10 IU/g hCG + 0.4 Lg/g GnRH-A. Further optimization is required, in particular the exploration of higher doses of GnRH-A. Lastly, we observed that the effect of seasonality influenced the hormonal efficacy and magnitude of the spermiation response. As was expected, quality and concentration parameters were affected by the month in which hormone administration occurred.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LISpermiation in the Southern Rocky Mountain Boreal toad, Anaxyrus boreas boreas, is elicited most effectively by hCG singly or in combination with GnRH-A.\nC_LIO_LISpermiation responses lasted up to 96 hours post injection (hpi) though quantity and quality parameters were highest in the first 12 hpi.\nC_LIO_LITotal motility, forward progressive motility and percentage live cells all indicated A. b. boreas sperm quality was in a good range.\nC_LIO_LIAcrosome integrity requires more research as it was comparatively lower than expected.\nC_LIO_LIResponses to hormone inductions are seasonally affected in this species but suggest semi-discontinuous cycling.\nC_LIO_LIEx situ breeding should perform better sperm assessments before designing breeding strategies.\nC_LI",
