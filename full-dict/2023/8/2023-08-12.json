    "abstract": "Structural plasticity is integral to RNA function; however, there are currently few methods to quantitatively resolve RNAs that have multiple structural states. NMR spectroscopy is a powerful approach for resolving conformational ensembles but is size-limited. Chemical probing is well-suited for large RNAs but provides limited structural and no kinetics information. Here, we integrate the two approaches to visualize a two-state conformational ensemble for the central stem-loop 3 (SL3) of 7SK RNA, a critical element for 7SK RNA function in transcription regulation. We find that the SL3 distal end exchanges between two equally populated yet structurally distinct states in both isolated SL3 constructs and full-length 7SK RNA. We rationally designed constructs that lock SL3 into a single state and demonstrate that both chemical probing and NMR data fit to a linear combination of the two states. Comparison of vertebrate 7SK RNA sequences shows conservation of both states, suggesting functional importance. These results provide new insights into 7SK RNA structural dynamics and demonstrate the utility of integrating chemical probing with NMR spectroscopy to gain quantitative insights into RNA conformational ensembles.",

    "abstract": "Shoes alter the evolved biomechanics of the foot, potentially affecting running kinematics and kinetics that can in turn influence injury and performance. An important feature of conventional running shoes is heel height, whose effects on foot and ankle biomechanics remain understudied. Here, we investigate the effects of 6 - 26 mm increases in heel height on ankle dynamics in 8 rearfoot strike runners who ran barefoot and in minimal shoes with added heels. We predicted higher heels would lead to greater frontal plane ankle torques due to the increased vertical moment arm of the mediolateral ground reaction force. Surprisingly, the torque increased in minimal shoes with no heel elevation, but then decreased with further increases in heel height due to changes in foot posture that are probably a strategy to compensate for potentially injurious ankle torques. We also found that increasing heel heights caused a large increase in the ankle plantarflexion velocity at heel strike, which we explain using a passive collision model. Our results highlight how running in minimal shoes may be significantly different from barefoot running due to complex interactions between proprioception and biomechanics that also permit runners to compensate for modifications to shoe design, more in the frontal than sagittal planes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAccurate senses depend on high fidelity encoding by sensory receptors and error-free central processing in the brain. Progress has been made towards restoring damaged sensory receptors. However, methods for providing on demand treatment of impaired central sensory processing arising from factors including aging, neurological dysfunction, inattention, and fatigue are scarce. Recent studies have demonstrated that tonic vagus nerve stimulation in rodents can activate the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system in the brain to improve sensory processing rapidly and continuously.\n\nHypothesisWe hypothesized that non-invasive neuromodulation via tonic transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) improves sensory performance in humans.\n\nMethodsTwenty-nine adults with no reported neurological dysfunction completed three sham-controlled experiments that measured effects of tVNS on sensory performance metrics (auditory gap detection, visual letter discrimination) and heart rate variability. Tonic tVNS was delivered continuously to cervical (neck) or auricular (ear) branches of the vagus nerve while participants performed psychophysics tasks or passively viewed a display without an accompanying task.\n\nResultsCervical tVNS improved auditory gap detection by 35% and visual letter discrimination by 20%, on average, relative to sham stimulation. Notably, participants with lower sensory performance during control conditions experienced larger tVNS-mediated improvements. Lastly, tVNS increased heart rate variability relative to sham stimulation during passive viewing, corroborating vagal engagement.\n\nConclusionWe demonstrate that non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation improves sensory processing in neurotypical human adults.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in microtissue engineered neural networks have opened avenues for the fabrication of biohybrid intracortical brain implants. To date, however, the experimental validation of these biohybrid implants has been restricted to singularly positioned electrodes, with the functionality confined to optical neuromodulation and neural recording. We present for the first time a biohybrid transition microelectrode array (TMEA) comprising a 4x4 matrix of biohybrid electrodes. These electrodes are expected to project axons into the brain, thereby establishing synaptic connections for electrical readout and excitation. Our device thus offers a promising pathway to leverage organic, endogenous materials in intracortical implants to enhance their biocompatibility as well as their functionality. In particular with respect to functionality, we assume that the spatiotemporal resolution of recorded neural signals may be significantly increased using this technology owing to the size ratios of these biohybrid microelectrodes compared to abiotic ones. Future investigations will therefore focus on the exploitation of the electrode density to further advance brain-computer interface technology.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of primate vision is the emphasis on foveal processing, accompanied by frequent saccades that bring the fovea to salient parts of the scene, or to newly appearing stimuli. A saccade to a new stimulus is one of the most fundamental sensory-motor transformations. In macaque monkeys, we show that foveal magnification is not only the reason for saccades, but it also governs the dynamics of saccade initiation. In a task where the monkeys made saccades to peripheral target onsets, saccadic reaction time (SRT) increased with target eccentricity. Notably, we effectively eliminated this increment by scaling the target size according to the foveal magnification factor in the superior colliculus (SC). We repeated the comparison between non- scaled and scaled targets, while changing the task to a delayed saccade task. In this task, the target was presented long before the saccade, and the saccade was triggered by fixation offset rather than target onset, such that target onset was essentially irrelevant for SRT. Crucially, in this task, we found that SRT increased with target eccentricity, for both non-scaled and scaled targets. Furthermore, this increment survived the addition of a salient foveal distracting flash. The results obtained with the delayed saccades task are consistent with an attentional scan from the fovea to the target, a recently hypothesized general mechanism of attention.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral responses to many odorants are not fixed but vary based on organismal needs. How such variations arise and the role of various neuromodulators in achieving flexible neural-to-behavioral mapping is not fully understood. In this study, we examined how serotonin modulates the neural and behavioral responses to odorants in locusts (Schistocerca americana). Our results indicated that serotonin can increase or decrease appetitive behavior in an odor-specific manner. On the other hand, in the antennal lobe, serotonergic modulation non-selectively enhanced odor-evoked response strength but left the temporal features and the combinatorial response profiles unperturbed. This result suggests that serotonin facilitates sensitive and robust recognition of odorants. Nevertheless, the uniform neural response amplification appeared to be at odds with the observed stimulus-specific behavioral modulation. We show that a simple linear model with neural ensembles segregated based on behavioral relevance is sufficient to explain the serotonin-mediated flexible mapping between neural and behavioral responses.",

    "abstract": "Southeast Asia is highly biodiverse and currently experiences among the highest rates of tropical deforestation globally, but impacts on biodiversity are not well synthesized. We use Bayesian multi-level modeling to meta-analyse 831 pairwise comparisons of biodiversity in sites subject to human land use change and anthropogenic forest disturbance (for example in plantations or logged forest) versus undisturbed sites. After controlling for hierarchical dependences, we show that biodiversity is a fifth lower in sites with these land-use changes (95% credible interval= 16-28%, mean = 22%). This reduction was greater when land use change/anthropogenic forest disturbances were high-intensity (34% reduction in biodiversity) compared to low-intensity (18% reduction), and effects were consistent across biogeographic regions and taxa. Oil-palm plantations lead to the greatest reduction in biodiversity (39%, CI 27-48%), and agroforests the least (24%, CI 10-37%). We also find that biodiversity is reduced in young secondary forest by 26% (CI 4-42%) compared to undisturbed forest, but there is no reduction in biodiversity for intermediate or mature-aged secondary forest (although species composition is potentially altered). Overall, our study provides the clearest evidence yet of the substantial detrimental impact of land-use change and anthropogenic forest disturbance on the biodiversity of Southeast Asia.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable self-repair ability of skeletal muscle tissues is driven by muscle stem cells, whose activities are orchestrated by a variety of transient cues present in their microenvironment. Understanding how the cross-interactions of these biophysical and biochemical microenvironmental cues influences muscle stem cells and their progeny is crucial in strategizing remedies for pathological dysregulation of these cues in aging and disease. In this study, we investigated the cell-level influences of extracellular matrix ligands in the context of mechanically tuned culture substrates on primary human myoblast contractility and proliferation within 16 hours of plating. We found that fibronectin led to stronger stiffness-dependent responses in myoblasts compared to laminin and collagen as revealed by cell spreading area, focal adhesion morphology, traction stresses, and proliferation. While we did not observe stiffness-dependent changes in cell fate signatures at this early time-point, an analysis of the stiffness-sensitive myoblast proteome uncovered an enrichment for differentiation associated signatures on 17 kPa culture substrates, in addition to distinct profiles with relation to metabolism, cytoskeletal regulation, ECM interactions, and nuclear component enrichment. Interestingly, we found that softer substrates increased the incidence of myoblasts with a wrinkled nucleus, and that the extent of wrinkling could predict Ki67 expression. While nuclear wrinkling and Ki67 expression could be controlled by pharmacological manipulation of cellular contractility, cellular traction stresses did not correlate with nuclear envelope wrinkling level. These results provide new insights into the regulation of human myoblast stiffness-dependent contractility response by ECM ligands and also highlight a link between myoblast contractility and proliferation.",

While there have been attempts to establish injury criteria for the most vulnerable organs, namely the lungs, existing criteria are highly variable due to insufficient human data and the corresponding inability to understand the underlying injury mechanisms. This study presents an experimental characterization of isolated human lung dynamics during simulated exposure to underwater shock waves. We found that the large acoustic impedance at the surface of the lung severely attenuated transmission of the shock wave into the lungs. However, the shock wave initiated large bulk pressure-volume cycles that are distinct from the response of the solid organs under similar loading. These pressure-volume cycles are due to compression of the contained gas, which we modeled with the Rayleigh-Plesset equation. The extent of these lung dynamics was dependent on physical confinement, which in real underwater blast conditions is influenced by factors such as rib cage properties and donned equipment. Findings demonstrate a potential causal mechanism for implosion injuries, which has significant implications for the understanding of primary blast lung injury due to underwater blast exposures.",

    "abstract": "1Resting-state network activity has been associated with the emergence of individual differences across childhood development. However, due to the limitations of time-averaged representations of neural activity, little is known about how cognitive and behavioural variability relates to the rapid spatiotemporal dynamics of these networks. Magnetoencephalography (MEG), which records neural activity at a millisecond timescale, can be combined with Hidden Markov Modelling (HMM) to track the spatial and temporal characteristics of transient neural states. We applied HMMs to resting-state MEG data from (n = 46) children aged 8-13, who were also assessed on their cognitive ability and across multiple parent-report measures of behaviour. We found that entropy-related properties of participants resting-state time-courses were positively associated with cognitive ability. Additionally, cognitive ability was positively correlated with the probability of transitioning into HMM states involving fronto-parietal and somatomotor activation, and negatively associated with a state distinguished by default-mode network suppression. We discuss how using dynamical measures to characterise rapid, spontaneous patterns of brain activity can shed new light on neurodevelopmental processes implicated in the emergence of cognitive differences in childhood.\n\nSignificance StatementThere is increasing evidence that the function of resting-state brain networks contributes to individual differences in cognition and behaviour across development. However, the relationship between dynamic, transient patterns of switching between resting-state networks and neurodevelopmental diversity is largely unknown. Here, we show that cognitive ability in childhood is related to the complexity of resting-state brain dynamics. Additionally, we demonstrate that the probability of transitioning into and remaining in certain  states of brain network activity predicts individual differences in cognitive ability.",

Our findings reveal that the multisensory condition not only intensified activations in the occipito-temporal  face patches and auditory  voice patches but also engaged a more extensive network that included additional parietal, prefrontal and cingulate areas, compared to the summed responses of the unimodal conditions.

We used functional neuroimaging (fMRI) to investigate garden-path sentences that cause difficulty during comprehension, in order to unpack the different processes used to support sentence interpretation. By investigating garden-path and other types of sentences within the same individuals, we functionally profiled different regions within the temporal and frontal cortices in the left hemisphere. The results revealed that different aspects of comprehension difficulty are handled by left posterior temporal, left anterior temporal, ventral left frontal, and dorsal left frontal cortices. The functional profiles of these regions likely lie along a spectrum of specificity to generality, including language-specific processing of linguistic representations, more general conflict resolution processes operating over linguistic representations, and processes for handling difficulty in general. These findings suggest that difficulty is not unitary and that there is a role for a variety of linguistic and non-linguistic processes in supporting comprehension.",

    "abstract": "Aging is often associated with a decrease in cognitive capacities. However, semantic memory appears relatively well preserved in healthy aging. Both behavioral and neuroimaging studies support the view that changes in brain networks contribute to this preservation of semantic cognition. However, little is known about the role of healthy aging in the brain representation of semantic categories. Here we used pattern classification analyses and computational models to examine the neural representations of living and non-living word concepts. The results demonstrate that brain representations of animacy in healthy aging exhibit increased similarity across categories, even across different task contexts. This pattern of results aligns with the neural dedifferentiation hypothesis that proposes that aging is associated with decreased specificity in brain activity patterns and less efficient neural resource allocation. However, the loss in neural specificity for different categories was accompanied by increased dissimilarity of item-based conceptual representations within each category. Taken together, the age-related patterns of increased generalization and specialization in the brain representations of semantic knowledge may reflect a compensatory mechanism that enables a more efficient coding scheme characterized by both compression and sparsity, thereby helping to optimize the limited neural resources and maintain semantic processing in the healthy aging brain.",

Decomposing the population code into independent and cell-cell interactions reveals how broad scene structure is encoded in the adapted retinal output. By recording from the same retina while presenting many different natural movies, we see that the population structure, characterized by strong interactions, is consistent across both natural and synthetic stimuli. We show that these interactions contribute to encoding scene identity. We also demonstrate that this structure likely arises in part from shared bipolar cell input as well as from gap junctions between retinal ganglion cells and amacrine cells.",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are state-of-the-art tools for modeling and decoding neural activity, but deploying them in closed-loop experiments with tight timing constraints is challenging due to their limited support in existing real-time frameworks. Researchers need a platform that fully supports high-level languages for running ANNs (e.g., Python and Julia) while maintaining support for languages that are critical for low-latency data acquisition and processing (e.g., C and C++). To address these needs, we introduce the Backend for Realtime Asynchronous Neural Decoding (BRAND). BRAND comprises Linux processes, termed nodes, which communicate with each other in a graph via streams of data. Its asynchronous design allows for acquisition, control, and analysis to be executed in parallel on streams of data that may operate at different timescales. BRAND uses Redis to send data between nodes, which enables fast inter-process communication and supports 54 different programming languages. Thus, developers can easily deploy existing ANN models in BRAND with minimal implementation changes. In our tests, BRAND achieved <600 microsecond latency between processes when sending large quantities of data (1024 channels of 30 kHz neural data in 1-millisecond chunks). BRAND runs a brain-computer interface with a recurrent neural network (RNN) decoder with less than 8 milliseconds of latency from neural data input to decoder prediction. In a real-world demonstration of the system, participant T11 in the BrainGate2 clinical trial performed a standard cursor control task, in which 30 kHz signal processing, RNN decoding, task control, and graphics were all executed in BRAND. This system also supports real-time inference with complex latent variable models like Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems. By providing a framework that is fast, modular, and language-agnostic, BRAND lowers the barriers to integrating the latest tools in neuroscience and machine learning into closed-loop experiments.",

    "abstract": "PRDM16 is a dynamic transcriptional regulator of various stem cell niches, including adipocytic, hematopoietic, cardiac progenitors, and neural stem cells. PRDM16 has been suggested to contribute to 1p36 deletion syndrome, one of the most prevalent subtelomeric microdeletion syndromes. We report a patient with a de novo nonsense mutation in the PRDM16 coding sequence, accompanied by lissencephaly and microcephaly features. Human stem cells were genetically modified to mimic this mutation, generating cortical organoids that exhibited altered cell cycle dynamics. RNA sequencing of cortical organoids at day 32 unveiled changes in cell adhesion and WNT-signaling pathways. ChIP-seq of PRDM16 identified binding sites in postmortem human fetal cortex, indicating the conservation of PRDM16 binding to developmental genes in mice and humans, potentially at enhancer sites. A shared motif between PRDM16 and LHX2 was identified and further examined through comparison with LHX2 ChIP-seq data from mice. These results suggested a collaborative partnership between PRDM16 and LHX2 in regulating a common set of genes and pathways in cortical radial glia cells, possibly via their synergistic involvement in cortical development.",
