    "abstract": "Mathematical models of viral infection have been developed and fit to data to gain insight into disease pathogenesis for a number of agents including HIV, hepatitis C and B virus. However, for acute infections such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2, as well as for infections such as hepatitis C and B that can be acute or progress to being chronic, viral load data are often collected after symptoms develop, usually around or after the peak viral load. Consequently, we frequently lack data in the exponential phase of viral growth, i.e., when most transmission events occur. Missing data may make estimation of the time of infection, the infectious period, and parameters in viral dynamic models, such as the cell infection rate, difficult. Here, we evaluated the reliability of estimates of key model parameters when viral load data prior to the viral load peak is missing. We estimated the time from infection to peak viral load by fitting non-linear mixed models to a dataset with frequent viral RNA measurements, including pre-peak. We quantified the reliability of estimated infection times, key model parameters, and the time to peak viral load. Although estimates of the time of infection are sensitive to the quality and amount of available data, other parameters important in understanding disease pathogenesis, such as the loss rate of infected cells, are less sensitive. We find a lack of data in the exponential growth phase underestimates the time to peak viral load by several days leading to a shorter predicted exponential growth phase. On the other hand, having an idea of the time of infection and fixing it, results in relatively good estimates of dynamical parameters even in the absence of early data.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial RNA helicase {rho} is a genome sentinel that terminates synthesis of damaged and junk RNAs that are not translated by the ribosome. Co-transcriptional RNA surveillance by {rho} is essential for quality control of the transcriptome during optimal growth. However, it is unclear how bacteria protect their RNAs from overzealous {rho} during dormancy or stress, conditions common in natural habitats. Here we used cryogenic electron microscopy, biochemical, and genetic approaches to show that residue substitutions, ADP, or ppGpp promote hyper-oligomerization of Escherichia coli {rho}. Our results demonstrate that nucleotides bound at subunit interfaces control {rho} switching from active hexamers to inactive higher-order oligomers and extended filaments. Polymers formed upon exposure to antibiotics or ppGpp disassemble when stress is relieved, thereby directly linking termination activity to cellular physiology. Inactivation of {rho} through hyper-oligomerization is a regulatory strategy shared by RNA polymerases, ribosomes, and metabolic enzymes across all life.",

    "abstract": "Daptomycin (DAP) is often used as a first line therapy to treat vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) infections but emergence of DAP non-susceptibility threatens the effectiveness of this antibiotic. Moreover, current methods to determine DAP MICs have poor reproducibility and accuracy. In enterococci, DAP resistance is mediated by the LiaFSR cell membrane stress response system and deletion of liaR encoding the response regulator results in hypersusceptibility to DAP and antimicrobial peptides. The main genes regulated by LiaR are a cluster of three genes, designated liaXYZ. In Enterococcus faecalis, LiaX is surface exposed with a C-terminus that functions as a negative regulator of cell membrane remodeling and an N-terminal domain that is released to the extracellular medium where it binds DAP. Thus, in E. faecalis, LiaX functions as a sentinel molecule recognizing DAP and controlling the cell membrane response, but less is known about LiaX in E. faecium. Here, we found that liaX is essential in E. faecium (Efm) with an activated LiaFSR system. Unlike E. faecalis, Efm LiaX is not detected in the extracellular milieu and does not appear to alter phospholipid architecture. We further postulated that LiaX could be used as a surrogate marker for cell envelope activation and non-susceptibility to DAP. For this purpose, we developed and optimized a LiaX ELISA. We then assessed 86 clinical E. faecium BSI isolates for DAP MICs and used whole genome sequencing to assess for substitutions in LiaX. All DAP-R clinical strains of E. faecium exhibited elevated LiaX levels. Strikingly, 73% of DAP-S isolates by standard MIC determination had elevated LiaX ELISAs above the established cut-off. Phylogenetic analyses of predicted amino acid substitutions showed 12 different variants of LiaX without a specific association with DAP MIC or LiaX ELISA values. Our findings also suggest that many Efm isolates that test DAP susceptible by standard MIC determination are likely to have an activated cell stress response that may predispose to DAP failure. As LiaX appears to be essential for the cell envelope response to DAP, its detection could prove useful to improve the accuracy of susceptibility testing by anticipating therapeutic failure.",

    "abstract": "Skin microbiome can be altered in patients with Atopic Dermatitis (AD). An understanding of the changes from healthy to atopic skin can help develop new targets for better treatments and identify specific microbial or molecular biomarkers. This study investigates the skin microbiome and metabolome of healthy subjects and lesion (ADL) and non-lesion (ADNL) of AD patients by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and mass spectrometry, respectively. Samples from AD patients showed alterations in the diversity and composition of the skin microbiome. Staphylococcus species, especially S. aureus, were significantly increased in the ADL group. Metabolomic profiles were also different between the groups. Dipeptide-derived are more abundant in ADL, which may be related to skin inflammation. Co-occurrence network analysis was applied to integrate the microbiome and metabolomics data and revealed higher co-occurrence of metabolites and bacteria in healthy and ADNL compared to ADL. S. aureus co-occurred with dipeptide-derived in ADL, while phytosphingosine-derived compounds showed co-occurrences with commensal bacteria, e.g. Paracoccus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Prevotella bivia, Lactobacillus iners, Anaerococcus sp., Micrococcus sp., Corynebacterium ureicelerivorans, Corynebacterium massiliense, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Roseomonas mucosa, in healthy and ADNL groups. Therefore, these findings provide valuable insights into how AD affects the human skin metabolome and microbiome.\n\nImportanceThis study provides valuable insight into changes in the skin microbiome and associated metabolomic profiles. It also identifies new therapeutic targets that may be useful for developing personalized treatments for individuals with atopic dermatitis based on their unique skin microbiome and metabolic profiles.",

These insights include broader phage populational dynamics such as temporal stability4, interindividual uniqueness5,6 and potential associations to specific disease states7,8. However, the functional understanding of phage-host interactions and their impacts within this complex ecosystem have been limited due to a lack of cultured isolates for experimental validation. Here we characterise 125 active prophages originating from 252 diverse human gut bacterial isolates using seven different induction conditions to substantially expand the experimentally validated temperate phage-host pairs originating from the human gut. Importantly, only 17% of computationally predicted prophages were induced with common induction agents and these exhibited distinct gene patterns compared to non-induced predictions. Active Bacteroidota prophages were among the most prevalent members of the gut virome, with extensive use of diversity generating retroelements and exhibiting broad host ranges. Moreover, active polylysogeny was present in 52% of studied gut lysogens and led to coordinated prophage induction across diverse conditions. This study represents a substantial expansion of experimentally validated gut prophages, providing key insights into their diversity and genetics, including a genetic pathway for prophage domestication and demonstration that differential induction was complex and influenced by divergent prophage integration sites. More broadly, it highlights the importance of experimental validation alongside genomic based computational prediction to enable further functional understanding of these commensal viruses within the human gut.",

    "abstract": "When cells have increased energy demand, they respond by elevating the production of new mitochondria through the process of mitochondrial biogenesis. This complex physiological undertaking requires precise coordination of mitochondrial and nuclear gene expression to extend the existing mitochondrial network in the cell. Using C. elegans as a model system we have identified stress-induced transcription factor SPTF-3 as a novel regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis on-demand upon increased heat stress, dietary restriction, and acute starvation. We show that SPTF-3 also regulates ATFS-1, the main transcriptional regulator of UPRmt (mitochondrial unfolded protein response). Thus, by orchestrating two parallel programs - mitochondrial biogenesis and UPRmt, SPTF-3 safeguards mitochondrial wellbeing and function upon stress, thus allowing survival in unfavorable conditions. Mitochondrial biogenesis is induced by disturbances in cytoplasmic ribosomal assembly, which leads to preferential translation of SPTF-3. Importantly, we demonstrated that the role of SPTF-3 in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis upon nutrient deprivation is conserved in mammals through its homolog SP1.",

In our previous publication (Long, Hwang et al. 2020), we presented data supporting the functional importance of RNA interaction in maintaining PRC2 occupancy on chromatin, using comprehensive approaches including an RNA-binding mutant of PRC2 and an rChIP-seq assay. Recently, concerns have been expressed regarding whether the RNA-binding mutant has impaired histone methyltransferase activity and whether the rChIP-seq assay can potentially generate artifacts. Here we provide new data that support a number of our original findings. First, we found the RNA-binding mutant to be fully capable of maintaining H3K27me3 levels in human induced pluripotent stem cells. The mutant had reduced methyltransferase activity in vitro, but only on some substrates at early time points. Second, we found that our rChIP-seq method gave consistent data across antibodies and cell lines. Third, we further optimized rChIP-seq by using lower concentrations of RNase A and incorporating a catalytically inactive mutant RNase A as a control, as well as using an alternative RNase (RNase T1). The EZH2 rChIP-seq results using the optimized protocols supported our original finding that RNA interaction contributes to the chromatin occupancy of PRC2.",

    "abstract": "Persistent latent reservoirs of intact HIV-1 proviruses, capable of rebounding despite suppressive ART, hinder efforts towards an HIV-1 cure. Hence, assays specifically quantifying intact proviruses are crucial to assess the impact of curative interventions. Clinical trials have utilized two recent assays: intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) and Q4PCR. While IPDA is more sensitive due to amplifying short fragments, it may overestimate intact fractions by relying only on two small regions. Q4PCR is sequencing-based and its performance might be subjected to bias against full-length proviruses. Leveraging digital PCR (dPCR) advancements, we developed the  Rainbow 5-plex proviral HIV-1 DNA assay, assessing it with standard materials and samples from 69 PLWH. The Rainbow assay proved equally sensitive but more specific than IPDA, is not subjected to bias against full-length proviruses, enabling high-throughput quantification of total and intact reservoir size. This innovation offers potential for targeted evaluation and monitoring of rebound-competent reservoirs, contributing to HIV-1 management and cure strategies.\n\nTeaserThe 5 color  HIV-1 Rainbow digital PCR assay offers a multi-level view on the HIV reservoir in one snapshot reaction.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) supports blood vessel architecture and functionality and undergoes active remodelling during vascular repair and atherogenesis. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are essential for vessel repair and, via their secretome, are able to invade from the vessel media into the intima to mediate ECM remodelling. Accumulation of fibronectin (FN) is a hallmark of early vascular repair and atherosclerosis and here we show that FN stimulates VSMCs to secrete small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) by activating the {beta}1 integrin/FAK/Src pathway as well as Arp2/3-dependent branching of the actin cytoskeleton. Spatially, sEV were secreted via filopodia-like cellular protrusions at the leading edge of migrating cells. We found that sEVs are trapped by the ECM in vitro and colocalise with FN in symptomatic atherosclerotic plaques in vivo. Functionally, ECM-trapped sEVs induced the formation of focal adhesions (FA) with enhanced pulling forces at the cellular periphery. Proteomic and GO pathway analysis revealed that VSMC-derived sEVs display a cell adhesion signature and are specifically enriched with collagen VI. In vitro assays identified collagen VI as playing the key role in cell adhesion and invasion. Taken together our data suggests that the accumulation of FN is a key early event in vessel repair acting to promote secretion of collage VI enriched sEVs by VSMCs. These sEVs stimulate migration and invasion by triggering peripheral focal adhesion formation and actomyosin contraction to exert sufficient traction forces to enable VSMC movement within the complex vascular ECM network.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/551257v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f76803org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cdb0f1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bbd66org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12fa6e2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Figure Abstract\n\nVascular smooth muscle cells sense fibronectin via 1 integrin and secrete small extracellular vesicles loaded with collagen VI via filopodia-like protrusions.

    "abstract": "In dividing cells, accurate chromosome segregation depends on sister chromatid cohesion, protein linkages that are established during DNA replication. Faithful chromosome segregation in oocytes requires that cohesion, first established in S phase, remain intact for days to decades, depending on the organism. Premature loss of meiotic cohesion in oocytes leads to the production of aneuploid gametes and contributes to the increased incidence of meiotic segregation errors as women age (maternal age effect). The prevailing model is that cohesive linkages do not turn over in mammalian oocytes. However, we have previously reported that cohesion-related defects arise in Drosophila oocytes when individual cohesin subunits or cohesin regulators are knocked down after meiotic S phase. Here we use two strategies to express a tagged cohesin subunit exclusively during mid-prophase in Drosophila oocytes and demonstrate that newly expressed cohesin is used to form de novo linkages after meiotic S phase. Moreover, nearly complete turnover of chromosome-associated cohesin occurs during meiotic prophase, with faster replacement on the arms than at the centromeres. Unlike S-phase cohesion establishment, the formation of new cohesive linkages during meiotic prophase does not require acetylation of conserved lysines within the Smc3 head. Our findings indicate that maintenance of cohesion between S phase and chromosome segregation in Drosophila oocytes requires an active cohesion rejuvenation program that generates new cohesive linkages during meiotic prophase.",

Here, we studied the developmental requirements for purine metabolism using the amphibian Xenopus laevis as a vertebrate model. We provide the first functional characterization of purine pathway-genes and show that these genes are mostly expressed in nervous and muscular embryonic tissues. Morphants were generated to decipher the functions of these genes, with a focus on the adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL), an enzyme required for both salvage and de novo purine pathways. adsl.L knock-down leads to severe reduction in the expression of the Myogenic Regulatory Factors (MRFs: Myod1, Myf5 and Myogenin), thus resulting in defects in somitogenesis and in the formation and/or migration of both craniofacial and hypaxial muscle progenitors. Similar alterations were observed upon reduced expression of hprt1.L and ppat, two genes specific to the salvage and the de novo pathways, respectively. In conclusion, our data shows for the first time that de novo and recycling purine pathways are essential for myogenesis and highlight new mechanisms in the regulation of MRFs gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The geographic extent of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a zoonotic, mosquito-borne virus, increased dramatically in south-eastern Australia over the summer of 2021-2022 resulting in outbreaks in piggeries, 45 cases of human disease, and simultaneous detection of JEV by mosquito and arbovirus surveillance programs. Preliminary investigation of the landscape epidemiology of the piggery outbreaks showed that they were associated with particular landscape structure as well as intermediate ardeid species richness. However, no exploration of the ways in which individual species or species composition may couple with JEV-associated landscape composition and configuration has been undertaken and, therefore, key questions regarding the landscape epidemiology and infection ecology of JEV in Australia remain unanswered. The current study sought to interrogate how individual species presence and their functional traits were distributed across the landscape, and how these distributions aligned with the landscape structure of JEV occurrence. Inhomogeneous Poisson point process models and multivariate hierarchical models were used to investigate the landscape-level ardeid species pools and the distribution of their pool-weighted traits with respect to JEV outbreaks. The distributions of six species were strongly associated with the distribution of JEV outbreaks reported in 2022: Casmerodius albus (Ardea alba), Ardea pacifica, Botaurus poiciloptilus, Egretta novaehollandiae, Ixobrychus minutus (Ixobrychus dubius), and Nycticorax caledonicus. Some JEV-delimiting landscape features, including transient wetlands and proximity to waterways, were associated with the presence of nearly all ardeid species, while others, such as crop cultivation, habitat fragmentation, and water flow accumulation were associated with only a subset of these species. In addition, hand-wing index was associated with species presence in landscapes associated with JEV outbreaks, which may suggest the importance of dispersal capacity in ardeid community assembly in landscapes that share environmental features with JEV occurrence. This study provides a preliminary selection of target species for the development of wild waterbird JEV surveillance, while uniquely accounting for sympatry and the potential for functional modulation of environmental filtering in high-risk landscapes, despite the broad landscape scale that necessarily constrained the analysis. Nevertheless, while the results provide an actionable One Health framework with which to develop wildlife surveillance, it must be noted that they do not describe community assembly rules, nor do they provide a description of community composition at local scale. The findings advance the current understanding of the landscape epidemiology of JEV in Australia by connecting landscapes with individual species from a family of established maintenance hosts and, given the large geographic extent of the potential circulation of JEV in maintenance hosts, provides valuable evidence-based information for targeted surveillance strategies.",

    "abstract": "Symbiosis drives the adaptation and evolution in multicellular organisms. Modeling the function and development of symbiotic cells/organs in holobionts is yet challenging. Here, we surveyed the molecular function and developmental trajectory of bacteriocyte lineage in non-model deep-sea mussels by constructing a high-resolution single-cell expression atlas of gill tissue. We show that mussel bacteriocytes optimized immune genes to facilitate recognition, engulfment, and elimination of endosymbionts, and interacted with them intimately in sterol, carbohydrate, and ammonia metabolism. Additionally, the bacteriocytes could arise from three different stem cells as well as bacteriocytes themselves. In particular, we showed that the molecular functions and developmental process of bacteriocytes were guided by the same set of regulatory networks and dynamically altered regarding to symbiont abundance via sterol-related signaling. The coordination in the functions and development of bacteriocytes and between the host and symbionts underlies the interdependency of symbiosis, and drives the deep-sea adaptation of mussels.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating gene function is a major goal in biology, especially among non-model organisms. However, doing so is complicated by the fact that molecular conservation does not always mirror functional conservation, and that complex relationships among genes are responsible for encoding pathways and higher-order biological processes. Co-expression, a promising approach for predicting gene function, relies on the general principal that genes with similar expression patterns across multiple conditions will likely be involved in the same biological process. For Cryptococcus neoformans, a prevalent human fungal pathogen greatly diverged from model yeasts, approximately 60% of the predicted genes in the genome lack functional annotations. Here, we leveraged a large amount of publicly available transcriptomic data to generate a C. neoformans Co-Expression Network (CryptoCEN), successfully recapitulating known protein networks, predicting gene function, and enabling insights into the principles influencing co-expression. With 100% predictive accuracy, we used CryptoCEN to identify 13 new DNA damage response genes, underscoring the utility of guilt-by-association for determining gene function. Overall, co-expression is a powerful tool for uncovering gene function, and decreases the experimental tests needed to identify functions for currently under-annotated genes.",

    "abstract": "Although genome wide association studies (GWAS) have been crucial for the identification of loci associated with sleep traits and disorders, the method itself does not directly uncover the underlying causal variants and corresponding effector genes. The overwhelming majority of such variants reside in non-coding regions and are therefore presumed to impact the activity of cis-regulatory elements, such as enhancers. Our previously reported  variant-to-gene mapping effort in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs), combined with validation in both Drosophila and zebrafish, implicated PIG-Q as a functionally relevant gene at the insomnia  WDR90 locus. However, importantly that effort did not characterize the corresponding underlying causal variant at this GWAS signal. Specifically, our genome-wide ATAC-seq and high-resolution promoter-focused Capture C datasets generated in this cell setting brought our attention to a shortlist of three tightly neighboring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in strong linkage disequilibrium in a candidate intronic enhancer region of WDR90 that contacted the open PIG-Q promoter. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of the proxy SNPs collectively and then individually on PIG-Q modulation and to pinpoint the causal \"regulatory\" variant among the three SNPs. Starting at a gross level perturbation, deletion of the entire region harboring all three SNPs in human iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells via CRISPR-Cas9 editing and subsequent RNA sequencing revealed expression changes in specific PIG-Q transcripts. Results from more refined individual luciferase reporter assays for each of the three SNPs in iPSCs revealed that the intronic region with the rs3752495 risk allele induced a [~]2.5-fold increase in luciferase expression (n=10). Importantly, rs3752495 also exhibited an allele specific effect, with the risk allele increasing the luciferase expression by [~]2-fold compared to the non-risk allele. In conclusion, our variant-to-function approach and subsequent in vitro validation implicates rs3752495 as a causal insomnia risk variant embedded at the WDR90-PIG-Q locus.",

Studies in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans suggested that variation of S aggregation depends on the genetic background.

To study the genotypic-phenotypic relationship of S aggregation, we constructed a Recombinant Inbred Line (RIL) panel derived from a cross between genetically divergent strains C. elegans NL5901 and SCH4856, both harboring the human S gene. As a first step to discover genetic modifiers 70 S-RILs were measured for whole-genome gene expression and expression quantitative locus analysis (eQTL) were mapped. We detected multiple eQTL hot-spots, many of which were located on Chromosome V. To confirm a causal locus, we developed Introgression Lines (ILs) that contain SCH4856 introgressions on Chromosome V in an NL5901 background. We detected 74 genes with an interactive effect between S and the genetic background, including the human p38 MAPK homologue pmk-1 that has previously been associated with PD. Together, we present a unique S-RIL panel for defining effects of natural genetic variation on S pathology, which contributes to finding genetic modifiers of PD.",

    "abstract": "Hox gene clusters encode transcription factors that drive regional specialization during animal development: e.g. the Hox factor Ubx is expressed in the insect metathoracic (T3) wing appendages and differentiates them from T2 mesothoracic identities. Hox transcriptional regulation requires silencing activities that prevent spurious activation and regulatory crosstalks in the wrong tissues, but this has seldom been studied in insects other than Drosophila, which shows a derived Hox dislocation into two genomic clusters that disjoined Antennapedia (Antp) and Ultrabithorax (Ubx). Here we investigated how Ubx is restricted to the hindwing in butterflies, amidst a contiguous Hox cluster. By analysing Hi-C and ATAC-seq data in the butterfly Junonia coenia, we show that a Topologically Associated Domain (TAD) maintains a hindwing-enriched profile of chromatin opening around Ubx. This TAD is bordered by a Boundary Element (BE) that separates it from a region of joined wing activity around the Antp locus. CRISPR mutational perturbation of this BE releases ectopic Ubx expression in forewings, inducing homeotic clones with hindwing identities. Further mutational interrogation of two non-coding RNA encoding regions and one putative cis-regulatory module within the Ubx TAD cause rare homeotic transformations in both directions, indicating the presence of both activating and repressing chromatin features. We also describe a series of spontaneous forewing homeotic phenotypes obtained in Heliconius butterflies, and discuss their possible mutational basis. By leveraging the extensive wing specialization found in butterflies, our initial exploration of Ubx regulation demonstrates the existence of silencing and insulating sequences that prevent its spurious expression in forewings.",

These choice history biases may reflect advantageous strategies to exploit temporal regularities of natural environments. However, it is unclear whether and how observers can adapt their choice history biases to different temporal regularities, to exploit the multitude of temporal correlations that exist in nature. Here, we show that mice adapt their perceptual choice history biases to different temporal regularities. This adaptation is well captured by a normative reinforcement learning algorithm with multi-trial belief states, comprising both current trial sensory and previous trial memory states. We demonstrate that striatal dopamine tracks predictions of the model and behavior, pointing towards the involvement of dopamine in forming adaptive history biases.

Previous research on the integration of new information into memory mainly focused on the hippocampus. Here, we hypothesized that the angular gyrus, known to be involved in episodic memory and imagination, plays a pivotal role in the insight-driven reconfiguration of memory representations. To test this hypothesis, participants received continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) inhibiting the left angular gyrus or sham stimulation before gaining insight into the relationship between previously separate life-like animated events in a narrative-insight task. During this task, participants also underwent EEG recording and their memory for linked and non-linked events was assessed shortly thereafter. Our results show that cTBS to the angular gyrus decreased memory for the linking events and reduced the memory advantage for linked relative to non-linked events. At the neural level, cTBS-induced angular gyrus inhibition reduced centro-temporal coupling with frontal regions and abolished insight-induced neural representational changes for events linked via imagination, indicating impaired memory reconfiguration. Further, the cTBS group showed representational changes for non-linked events that resembled the patterns observed in the sham group for the linked events, suggesting failed pruning of the narrative in memory. Together, our findings demonstrate a causal role of the left angular gyrus in insight-related memory reconfigurations.",

Reactive, hard-wired behaviors - such as freezing or flight - are feasible in some situations, but in others contexts an acquired, adaptive action may be more effective. Although the vmPFC has been implicated in adaptive threat avoidance, the contribution of distinct vmPFC neural subtypes with differing molecular identities and wiring patterns is poorly understood. Here, we studied vmPFC parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in mice as they learned to cross a chamber in order to avoid an impending shock, a behavior that requires both learned, adaptive action and the suppression of cued freezing. We found that vmPFC PV neural activity increased upon movement to avoid the shock, when the competing freezing response was suppressed. However, neural activity did not change upon movement toward cued rewards or during general locomotion, conditions with no competing behavior. Optogenetic suppression of vmPFC PV neurons delayed the onset of avoidance behavior and increased the duration of freezing, but did not affect movement toward rewards or general locomotion. Thus, vmPFC PV neurons support flexible, adaptive behavior by suppressing the expression of prepotent behavioral reactions.",

After training, the reconstructed images approximate the homologous components in the hemisphere. We use the difference between the actual and reconstructed hemispheres to measure hemisphere-specific components due to asymmetric expression of environmental and genetic factors.

These genes shift expression profiles across morphs by either turning off any expression in one morph or changing the timing or amount of gene expression. We directly connect the contributions of these mechanisms to differences in developmental processes.
