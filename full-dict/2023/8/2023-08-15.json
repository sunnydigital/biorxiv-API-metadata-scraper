    "abstract": "The mammalian placentas interface with the parent is a richly vascularized tissue whose development relies upon communication between many different cell types within the uterine microenvironment. The uterine blood vessels of the interface are reshaped during pregnancy into wide-bore, flaccid vessels that convey parental blood to the exchange region of the placenta. Fetally-derived invasive trophoblast as well as parental uterine macrophages and Natural Killer cells are involved in the stepwise remodeling of these vessels and their respective contributions to this crucial process are still being delineated. However, the earliest steps in arteriole remodeling are understudied as they are difficult to study in humans, and other species lack the deep trophoblast invasion that is so prominent a feature of placentation in humans. Here, we establish the rat, with deep hemochorial placentation akin to humans, as a model system in which to tease apart the earliest, relatively understudied events in spiral arteriole remodeling. We show that the rat uterine placental interface increases in size and vascularity rapidly, before trophoblast invasion. The remodeling stages in the arterioles of the rat uterine-placental interface follow a sequence of anatomical changes similar to those in humans, and there are changes to the arterioles muscular tunica media prior to the marked influx of immune cells. The rat is a tractable model in which to better understand the cell/cell interactions occurring in vivo in an intact tissue microenvironment over time.",

    "abstract": "Lymphatic vessel development has been a subject of research for about 120 years. Studies employing mice and zebrafish models have elucidated that lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) predominantly differentiate from venous endothelial cells via the expression of transcription factor Prospero homeobox protein 1 (Prox1), a master regulator of lymphatic vessel development. On the other hand, it has been found that LECs can also be generated from undifferentiated mesodermal or hemogenic endothelial cells, suggesting potential diversity in their origins depending on the organ or anatomical location. However, knowledge of human lymphatic vessel development remains limited. Here, we examined early lymphatic development in humans by analyzing 31 embryos and three 9-week old fetuses. We found that human embryos produce Prox1-expressing LECs in and around the cardinal veins, which converged to form initial lymph sacs. Furthermore, we also examined lymphatic vessel development in the heart, lungs, lower jaw, mesentery, intestines and kidneys. Lymphatic vessels appeared to develop at different rates in each organ and to display temporal differences in marker expression. These observation showed the possibility that there could exist different patterns of lymphatic vessel development across organs, which may reflect different cellular origins or developmental signaling in each organ.\n\nOur study elucidates early human lymphatic vessel development, which facilitates understanding of lymphatic vessel evolution and phylogenetics, and also leads to illuminate the etiology of congenital lymph-related diseases, such as lymphatic malformations.\n\nSignificance StatementLymphatic vessel development has been a focus of research for over a century. Recent studies across a variety of species have demonstrated that lymphatic endothelial cells originate from embryonic veins, and undifferentiated mesodermal cells. However, whether these findings are applicable to human has yet to be determined. In this study, we explored lymphatic vessel development in humans. Our analysis demonstrated that lymphatic endothelial cells in human embryos initially derived from embryonic veins. Notably, we found that lymphatic vessels in different organs displayed distinct developmental and marker expression patterns, suggesting a diversity in lymphatic vessel development across organs. Our research revealed the human lymphatic vessel development, contributing to the understanding of phylogenetics of lymphatic vessels and lymph-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "The creation-mutation-selection model makes predictions regarding the fitness of asexual and sexual populations in an environment that includes both positive and negative selection. However, for the asexual case, the model predictions depend upon the variance or skewness of the population log fitness distribution, something which the model does not provide. This makes the analytical comparison of the fitness of asexual and sexual populations appear to be intractable. Instead, simulation is required. The fitness of asexual and sexual populations is simulated over a range of plausible parameter values. The fitness is found to agree with the predictions of the creation-mutation-selection model. The cost of asexuality is found to exceed the cost of sex by a very large margin for eukaryotic species today, and probably for the first eukaryotes. Prokaryotes and the mitochondrion are viewed as asexual species for which asexuality incurs little cost.",

    "abstract": "Kingdom-level branches are being added to the tree of eukaryotes at a rate approaching one per year, with no signs of slowing down1-4. Some are completely new discoveries, while others are morphologically unusual protists that were previously described but lacked molecular data. For example, Hemimastigophora are predatory protists with two rows of flagella that were known since the 19th century, but proved to represent a new deep-branching eukaryote lineage when phylogenomic analyses were conducted2. Meteora sporadica Hausmann et al. 20025 is a protist with a unique morphology and motility; cells glide over substrates along a long axis of anterior and posterior projections, and have a pair of lateral  arms that swing back and forth. Originally, Meteora was described by light microscopy only, from a short-term enrichment of deep-sea sediment. A small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) sequence was reported recently, but the phylogenetic placement of Meteora remained unresolved6. Here, we investigated two cultivated Meteora sporadica isolates in detail. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the anterior-posterior projections are supported by microtubules originating from a cluster of subnuclear MTOCs. Likewise, the arms are supported by microtubules, and neither have a flagellar axoneme-like structure. Sequencing the mitochondrial genome showed this to be amongst the most gene-rich known, outside jakobids. Remarkably, phylogenomic analyses of 254 nuclear protein-coding genes robustly support a close relationship with Hemimastigophora. Our study suggests that Meteora and Hemimastigophora together represent a morphologically diverse  supergroup, and thus are important for resolving the tree of eukaryote life and early eukaryote evolution.",

    "abstract": "Extreme environmental variability requires the identification of genetic diversity that can help crops withstand difficult abiotic conditions. Understanding the genetic basis of adaptation to abiotic stress can provide tools for adapting agriculture to changing climates. Crop landraces and their wild ancestors from centers of domestication have often evolved across diverse environmental conditions and provide a unique opportunity to locate loci harboring alleles that could contribute to abiotic stress tolerance, among other traits. We collected chile peppers (Capsicum spp.) from farmers in southern Mexico along environmental transects crossing temperature, precipitation, and elevational gradients. Using 32,623 filtered SNPs generated from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), we conducted an environmental association analysis (EAA) combined with two outlier analyses, FST and spatial ancestry analyses to detect priority candidate loci associated with climate and soil phenotypes relevant to drought tolerance. Even though cultivated species may be shielded from some environmental selection by management practices (e.g., irrigation), we found fifteen priority loci whose genetic variation covaried with environmental variation in our EAA and were also allele frequency outliers (i.e., Fst and/or SPA). Thirty-three percent of the priority loci were validated with phenotype in response to water deficit. The haplotype blocks associated with these loci identify unique genetic variants worthy of conservation and harbor genes with abiotic stress-related functions. This work provides valuable information to explore quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying abiotic stress tolerance in chile pepper and is a new resource for improving plant breeding around the world.\n\nArticle SummaryThe extreme environmental variability faced by crops requires the identification of potentially adaptive loci for abiotic stressors. We conducted an environmental association analysis (EAA) environments using chile peppers collected in southern Mexico along environmental transects crossing temperature, precipitation, and elevational gradients. We combined EAA with outlier analyses FST and spatial ancestry analysis to detect priority candidate loci associated with climate and soil phenotypes relevant to drought tolerance that may putatively contribute to abiotic stress adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Polymeric hydrogels can mimic features of native extracellular matrix (ECM), and their facile production and characterization enable customizable cell encapsulation and 3-dimensional (3D) culture. These have applications relevant to dentistry such as soft tissue engineering, cancer modeling, and drug screening. Hyaluronan (HA), a biologically-derived polymer found in native ECM, offers an optimal platform for this use, as it can be modified covalently with adhesive ligands, enzyme-degradable crosslinkers, and other biorelevant moieties, yielding tailored physical properties and biological response. Cell-directed degradation of these encapsulating matrices can be a prerequisite for phenotype preservation, but degradation kinetics may not match desired timelines for drug screening applications. This study focused on optimizing hydrogel composition, network structure, and gelation kinetics to preserve z-distribution of physiologically relevant cells within high-throughput microfluidic plates. Hydrogels were formed from aqueous solutions of thiolated HA (HA-SH), bifunctional acrylated poly(ethylene glycol)-peptide crosslinkers, and pendant acrylated peptides (RGD or YIGSR sequences) to support cell adhesion. By varying the absolute crosslinker concentration and relative proportions of high:low crosslinker degradation kinetics, hydrogels could be tuned to desired moduli (G: [~]10-120 Pa) and enzymatic degradation rate. Ratios of high:low degradable crosslinkers, at equivalent total crosslinker concentration, minimally impacted final modulus or gelation rate. Similarly, pendant adhesive ligands were swapped easily with negligible impact on hydrogel physical properties. Hydrogels with a 50:50 ratio of high:low degradable crosslinkers provided a \"safety net\" that preserved z-distribution of encapsulated bone marrow-derived fibroblasts, while maintaining expected phenotype. A comparable system supported the 3D co-culture of primary human salivary epithelial and mesenchymal cells within a perfusable microfluidic multiwell plate. This customizable bottom-up construction reduced confounding factors encountered in hybridoma-derived protein matrices, enabling modular customization of physiologically relevant, yet reproducible matrices to replicate native ECM. Our optimized model demonstrates workflows to improve future pharmaceutical screens, and tailor tissue engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "Apoptosis is crucially regulated by the Bcl-6 protein, and mutations in this protein can have a significant impact on many malignancies. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations to examine the effects of specific mutations (Q8C, R67C, and N84C) in the crystal structure of the BCL6 BTB domain in a compound with pyrazole-pyrimidine ligand. We concentrated on comprehending the dynamics of these alterations and their possible effects on the emergence of cancer. To explore the structural and dynamic changes induced by these mutations, we performed in silico simulations using the GROMACS software suite (version 5.2, 2020.1) on Google Colabs Tesla T4 GPU. The crystal structure of the BCL6 BTB domain in complex with the pyrazole-pyrimidine ligand (PDB ID: 5N20) served as the wild-type reference structure. Mutations were imposed using the Rotamer functions of Chimera. The simulations were carried out for a total duration of 20 ns using a time step of 2 femtoseconds (0.002 ps). The Trajectory profiles of the BCL6 BTB domain protein and its three mutations, Q8C, R67C and N84C, were shown to differ from each other. Based on the analysis of RMSD, RMSF, and Rg, it was determined that the mutant 2 (R67C) protein exhibited increased instability and greater flexibility. In contrast, mutant 3 (N84C) demonstrates a heightened level of compactness and greater stability compared to the remaining protein mutant. PCA also provides information regarding the structural dynamics of these mutants. In addition, the SASA and SASA autocorrelation provides a distinct view of the solvent accessibility of these proteins.",

A comparative analysis tool that can search, match, and visualize both similarities and differences of molecular features in space across multiple samples is lacking. To address this, we introduce CAST (Cross-sample Alignment of SpaTial omics), a deep graph neural network (GNN)-based method enabling spatial-to-spatial searching and matching at the single-cell level. CAST aligns tissues based on intrinsic similarities of spatial molecular features and reconstructs spatially resolved single-cell multi-omic profiles. CAST enables spatially resolved differential analysis ({Delta}Analysis) to pinpoint and visualize disease-associated molecular pathways and cell-cell interactions, and single-cell relative translational efficiency (scRTE) profiling to reveal variations in translational control across cell types and regions. CAST serves as an integrative framework for seamless single-cell spatial data searching and matching across technologies, modalities, and disease conditions, analogous to BLAST in sequence alignment.",

With a beam size chosen to fill the camera at a given image magnification, the circular lobes of the beam will extend beyond the cameras field of view and irradiate areas that are not acquired on the camera, damaging and precluding them from future acquisitions if the sample is beam sensitive. In this paper we present development of condenser aperture plates for TEM that have square and rectangular apertures which improve the efficiency of sample area usage by 44% or greater in low dose TEM applications. We demonstrate that the use of these apertures is compatible with high-resolution cryogenic (cryo) TEM by reconstructing sub 2 [A] apo-ferritin models from a datasets recorded with both square and rectangular apertures. Moreover the design of our aperture plates should improve the flexibility of 2 condenser systems for cryo-TEM acquisitions with multiple shots per hole by tailored matching of beam sizes to camera sizes at each magnification.",

    "abstract": "CLC-2 is a voltage-gated chloride channel that contributes to electrical excitability and ion homeostasis in many different mammalian tissues and cell types. Among the nine mammalian CLC homologs, CLC-2 is uniquely activated by hyperpolarization, rather than depolarization, of the plasma membrane. The molecular basis for the divergence in polarity of voltage gating mechanisms among closely related CLC homologs has been a long-standing mystery, in part because few CLC channel structures are available, and those that exist exhibit high conformational similarity. Here, we report cryoEM structures of human CLC-2 at 2.46 - 2.76 [A], in the presence and absence of the potent and selective inhibitor AK-42. AK-42 binds within the extracellular entryway of the Cl--permeation pathway, occupying a pocket previously proposed through computational docking studies. In the apo structure, we observed two distinct apo conformations of CLC-2 involving rotation of one of the cytoplasmic C-terminal domains (CTDs). In the absence of CTD rotation, an intracellular N-terminal 15-residue hairpin peptide nestles against the TM domain to physically occlude the Cl--permeation pathway from the intracellular side. This peptide is highly conserved among species variants of CLC-2 but is not present in any other CLC homologs. Previous studies suggested that the N-terminal domain of CLC-2 influences channel properties via a \"ball-and-chain\" gating mechanism, but conflicting data cast doubt on such a mechanism, and thus the structure of the N-terminal domain and its interaction with the channel has been uncertain. Through electrophysiological studies of an N-terminal deletion mutant lacking the 15-residue hairpin peptide, we show that loss of this short sequence increases the magnitude and decreases the rectification of CLC-2 currents expressed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, we show that with repetitive hyperpolarization WT CLC-2 currents increase in resemblance to the hairpin-deleted CLC-2 currents. These functional results combined with our structural data support a model in which the N-terminal hairpin of CLC-2 stabilizes a closed state of the channel by blocking the cytoplasmic Cl--permeation pathway.",

    "abstract": "As for many other groups, patterns of biodiversity for subter-ranean crustaceans in Europe indicate larger morphospecies ranges at higher latitudes (the so-called Rapoport effect). However, this observed correlation may be artefactual if many of those high-latitude, widely distributed morphospecies are actually species complexes. To test this hypothesis, we looked for previously undetected species boundaries within Niphargus aquilex and Niphargus schellenbergi, two closely related morphospecies of groundwater amphipods widely distributed in northern Europe, by sequencing fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) and of the nuclear 28S ribosomal RNA gene of 198 individuals collected across their area of distribution. Distance-based and allele sharing-based species delimitation approaches were congruent in revealing the existence of at least eight species within N. aquilex and at least two species with N. schellenbergi. Our data demonstrate that these two common morphospecies with large ranges are actually complexes of species with narrower distributions, suggesting that the Rapoport effect might be the result of increased morphological stasis at high latitudes rather than actual differences in sizes of distribution ranges.",

    "abstract": "The circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is essential for maintaining brain homeostasis and clearance, and impairments in its flow can lead to various brain disorders. Recent studies have shown that CSF circulation can be interrogated using low b-value diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (low-b dMRI). Nevertheless, the spatial organization of intracranial CSF flow dynamics remains largely elusive. Here, we developed a whole-brain voxel-based analysis framework, termed CSF pseudo-diffusion spatial statistics (C{Psi}SS), to examine CSF mean pseudo-diffusivity (M{Psi}), a measure of CSF flow magnitude derived from low-b dMRI. We showed that intracranial CSF M{Psi} demonstrates characteristic covariance patterns by employing seed-based correlation analysis. Importantly, we applied non-negative matrix factorization analysis to further elucidate the covariance patterns of CSF M{Psi} in a hypothesis-free, data-driven way. We identified distinct CSF spaces that consistently displayed unique pseudo-diffusion characteristics across multiple imaging datasets. Our study revealed that age, sex, brain atrophy, ventricular anatomy, and cerebral perfusion differentially influence M{Psi} across these CSF spaces. Notably, individuals with anomalous CSF flow patterns displayed incidental findings on multimodal neuroradiological examinations.

    "abstract": "Visual working memory enables flexible behavior by decoupling sensory stimuli from behavioral actions. While previous studies have predominantly focused on the storage component of working memory, the role of future actions in shaping working memory remains unknown. To answer this question, we used two working memory tasks that allowed the dissociation of sensory and action components of working memory. We measured behavioral performance and neuronal activity in the macaque prefrontal cortex area, frontal eye fields. We show that the action space reshapes working memory, as evidenced by distinct patterns of memory tuning and attentional orienting between the two tasks. Notably, neuronal activity during the working memory period predicted future behavior and exhibited mixed selectivity in relation to the sensory space but linear selectivity relative to the action space. This linear selectivity was achieved through the rapid transformation from sensory to action space and was subsequently maintained as a stable cross-temporal population activity pattern. Combined, we provide direct physiological evidence of the action-oriented nature of frontal eye field neurons during memory tasks and demonstrate that the anticipation of behavioral outcomes plays a significant role in transforming and maintaining the contents of visual working memory.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade targeting PD-1 shows great success in cancer therapy. However, the mechanism of how ligand binding initiates PD-1 signaling remains unclear. As prognosis markers of multiple cancers, soluble PD-L1 is found in patient sera and can bind PD-1, but fails to suppress T cell function. This and our previous observations that T cells exert endogenous forces on PD-1- PD-L2 bonds prompt the hypothesis that mechanical force might be critical to PD-1 triggering, which is missing in the soluble ligand case due to the lack of mechanical support afforded by surface-anchored ligand. Here we show that PD-1 function is eliminated or reduced when mechanical support on ligand is removed or dampened, respectively. Force spectroscopic analysis reveals that PD-1 forms catch bonds with both PD-Ligands <7 pN where force prolongs bond lifetime, but slip bonds >8 pN where force accelerates dissociation. Steered molecular dynamics finds PD-1-PD-L2 complex very sensitive to force due to the two molecules \"side-to-side\" binding via {beta} sheets. Pulling causes relative rotation and translation between the two molecules by stretching and aligning the complex along the force direction, yielding new atomic contacts not observed in the crystal structure. Compared to wild-type, PD-1 mutants targeting the force-induced new interactions maintain the same binding affinity but display lower rupture force, shorter bond lifetime, reduced tension, and most importantly, impaired capacity to suppress T cell activation. Our results uncover a mechanism for cells to probe the mechanical support of PD-1-PD-Ligand bonds using endogenous forces to regulate PD-1 triggering.",

    "abstract": "Despite the success of fructose as a low-cost food additive, recent epidemiological evidence suggests that high fructose consumption by pregnant mothers or during adolescence is associated with disrupted neurodevelopment1-7. An essential step in appropriate mammalian neurodevelopment is the synaptic pruning and elimination of newly-formed neurons by microglia, the central nervous systems (CNS) resident professional phagocyte8-10. Whether early life high fructose consumption affects microglia function and if this directly impacts neurodevelopment remains unknown. Here, we show that both offspring born to dams fed a high fructose diet and neonates exposed to high fructose exhibit decreased microglial density, increased uncleared apoptotic cells, and decreased synaptic pruning in vivo. Importantly, deletion of the high affinity fructose transporter SLC2A5 (GLUT5) in neonates completely reversed microglia dysfunction, suggesting that high fructose directly affects neonatal development. Mechanistically, we found that high fructose treatment of both mouse and human microglia suppresses synaptic pruning and phagocytosis capacity which is fully reversed in GLUT5-deficient microglia. Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro nuclear magnetic resonance- and mass spectrometry-based fructose tracing, we found that high fructose drives significant GLUT5-dependent fructose uptake and catabolism, rewiring microglia metabolism towards a hypo-phagocytic state. Importantly, mice exposed to high fructose as neonates exhibited cognitive defects and developed anxiety-like behavior which were rescued in GLUT5-deficient animals. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the epidemiological observation that early life high fructose exposure is associated with increased prevalence of adolescent anxiety disorders.",

    "abstract": "Pooled CRISPR screening has emerged as a powerful method of mapping gene functions thanks to its scalability, affordability, and robustness against well or plate-specific confounders present in array-based screening 1-6. Most pooled CRISPR screens assay for low dimensional phenotypes (e.g. fitness, fluorescent markers). Higher-dimensional assays such as perturb-seq are available but costly and only applicable to transcriptomics readouts 7-11. Recently, pooled optical screening, which combines pooled CRISPR screening and microscopy-based assays, has been demonstrated in the studies of the NFkB pathway, essential human genes, cytoskeletal organization and antiviral response 12-15. While the pooled optical screening methodology is scalable and information-rich, the applications thus far employ hypothesis-specific assays. Here, we enable hypothesis-free reverse genetic screening for generic morphological phenotypes by re-engineering the Cell Painting 16 technique to provide compatibility with pooled optical screening. We validated this technique using well-defined morphological genesets (124 genes), compared classical image analysis and self-supervised learning methods using a mechanism-of-action (MoA) library (300 genes), and performed discovery screening with a druggable genome library (1640 genes) 17. Across these three experiments we show that the combination of rich morphological data and deep learning allows gene networks to emerge without the need for target-specific biomarkers, leading to better discovery of gene functions.",

    "abstract": "Runners with Achilles tendinopathy (AT) have lower neural drive to gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) and it has been shown that modified foot position during plantarflexion activity affects motor unit discharge properties of GL. This paper tested the motor unit (MU) responses of GL and gastrocnemius medialis (GM) to feet-neutral and feet-in. We recruited runners with (n=18) and without (n=19) AT for experiment 1(EXP1) and nine healthy individuals for experiment 2(EXP2). High-Density electromyography was used to analyse MU discharge rates (MUDR) for GL and GM, during an isometric plantarflexion (EXP1) with feet-neutral and feet-in; and during a 30%-peak torque (EXP2) using a dynamometer. In EXP1 MUDR were lower during feet-in in GL (p<0.001) and in GM (p<0.001), without group difference (p=0.84). Furthermore, cumulative spike train analysis showed no difference in GL or GM neural drive between group or condition. EXP2 showed no condition differences in GL (p=0.91); and lower MUDR in GM (p=0.01). Finally, the AT group have lower triceps surae endurance observed during single leg heel raise. Our data indicate that feet-in reduces gastrocnemii MUDR, compared to feet-neutral, irrespective of tendinopathy. Current understanding of modulation strategies to GL driven by feet position is conflicting; thus, plantarflexion using feet in may not be a viable treatment strategy for AT.\n\nNEW & NOTEWORTHYPlantarflexion performed with feet inwards does not increase the neural drive to gastrocnemius lateralis as suggested in the literature. In fact, the feet-in condition reduced the motor unit discharge rates in both gastrocnemii during isometric plantarflexion and isometric plantarflexion using dynamometry. Therefore, this is not a viable treatment strategy for runners with Achilles tendinopathy. Furthermore, prioritising strategies to improve triceps surae endurance should be a key component in physiotherapy program.",

    "abstract": "Rhodnius prolixus is currently the model vector of choice for studying Chagas disease transmission, a debilitating disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi parasites. Despite the broad use of double-stranded RNA interference for the knockdown of gene function in R. prolixus, transgenesis and gene editing protocols are still lacking. Here we tested Receptor-Mediated Ovary Transduction of Cargo (ReMOT Control) and direct parental injection of CRISPR (DIPA-CRISPR) for the maternal delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 elements to developing R. prolixus oocytes, and strategies for the identification of insertions/deletions (indels) in target loci of resulting gene-edited G0 nymphs. We demonstrate successful ReMOT Control-mediated gene editing of the eye color markers Rp-scarlet and Rp-white, and the cuticle color marker Rp-yellow, with highest effectiveness obtained using the ovary-targeting BtKV ligand. These results provide proof-of-concepts for generating somatic mutations in R. prolixus and potentially for generating germline edited lines in triatomines. Our studies also suggest that optimal strategies for recovery of mutations include performing multiple gRNA injections and the use of visible phenotypes such as those displayed in the Rp-scarlet, Rp-white and Rp-yellow loci for future Co-CRISPR experiments. These results will lay the foundation for gene editing protocols for triatomines and could lead to the development of novel control strategies for vectors of Chagas disease.\n\nAuthor SummaryRhodnius prolixus is an insect vector of the protozoan Trypanossoma cruzi, causative agent of debilitating Chagas disease. To fight the spread of the disease, it has been suggested that biological control of the insect should be attempted. Gene editing by the novel CRISPR methodology holds great promise in this sense, as it enables to target almost any gene in the genome for mutagenesis, thus allowing the control of insect physiology and reproduction. Here we have tested protocols for the delivery of CRISPR reagents as an attempt to enable genome editing of the vector. Our results show that maternal delivery of CRISPR by the ReMOT Control method is efficient for mutating eye and cuticle color genes in the resulting nymphs, generating edited animals with red eyes, white eyes or a yellow cuticle. This is the first report of gene editing in a vector of Chagas disease and should lay the basis to produce modified animals either unable to carry the T. cruzi parasite or to reproduce.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe development of diverse spatial profiling technologies has provided an unprecedented insight into molecular mechanisms driving cancer pathogenesis. Here, we conducted the first integrated cross-species assessment of spatial transcriptomics and spatial metabolomics alterations associated with progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), bona fide cystic precursors of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).\n\nMethodsMatrix Assisted Laster Desorption/Ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS)-based spatial imaging and Visium spatial transcriptomics (ST) (10X Genomics) was performed on human resected IPMN tissues (N= 23) as well as pancreata from a mutant Kras;Gnas mouse model of IPMN. Findings were further compared with lipidomic analyses of cystic fluid from 89 patients with histologically confirmed IPMNs, as well as single-cell and bulk transcriptomic data of PDAC and normal tissues.\n\nResultsMALDI-MS analyses of IPMN tissues revealed long-chain hydroxylated sulfatides, particularly the C24:0(OH) and C24:1(OH) species, to be selectively enriched in the IPMN and PDAC neoplastic epithelium. Integrated ST analyses confirmed that the cognate transcripts engaged in sulfatide biosynthesis, including UGT8, Gal3St1, and FA2H, were co-localized with areas of sulfatide enrichment. Lipidomic analyses of cystic fluid identified several sulfatide species, including the C24:0(OH) and C24:1(OH) species, to be significantly elevated in patients with IPMN/PDAC compared to those with low-grade IPMN. Targeting of sulfatide metabolism via the selective galactosylceramide synthase inhibitor, UGT8-IN-1, resulted in ceramide-induced lethal mitophagy and subsequent cancer cell death in vitro, and attenuated tumor growth of mutant Kras;Gnas allografts. Transcript levels of UGT8 and FA2H were also selectively enriched in PDAC transcriptomic datasets compared to non-cancerous areas, and elevated tumoral UGT8 was prognostic for poor overall survival.\n\nConclusionEnhanced sulfatide metabolism is an early metabolic alteration in cystic pre-cancerous lesions of the pancreas that persists through invasive neoplasia. Targeting sulfatide biosynthesis might represent an actionable vulnerability for cancer interception.",

    "abstract": "Efficacy data from diverse chemical libraries, screened against the various stages of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, including asexual blood stage (ABS) parasites and transmissible gametocytes, serves as a valuable reservoir of information on the chemical space of compounds that are either active (or not) against the parasite. We postulated that this data can be mined to define chemical features associated with sole ABS activity and/or those that provide additional life cycle activity profiles like gametocytocidal activity. Additionally, this information could provide chemical features associated with inactive compounds, which could eliminate any future unnecessary screening of similar chemical analogues. Therefore, we aimed to use machine learning to identify the chemical space associated with stage-specific antimalarial activity. We collected data from various chemical libraries that were screened against the asexual (126 374 compounds) and sexual (gametocyte) stages of the parasite (93 941 compounds), calculated the compounds molecular fingerprints and trained machine learning models to recognize stage-specific active and inactiv compounds. We were able to build several models that predicts compound activity against ABS and dual-activity against ABS and gametocytes, with Support Vector Machines (SVM) showing superior abilities with high recall (90% and 66%) and low false positive predictions (15% and 1%). This allowed identification of chemical features enriched in active and inactive populations, an important outcome that could be mined for essential chemical features to streamline hit-to-lead optimization strategies of antimalarial candidates. The predictive capabilities of the models held true in diverse chemical spaces, indicating that the ML models are therefore robust and can serve as a prioritization tool to drive and guide phenotypic screening and medicinal chemistry programs.\n\nFor Table of Contents Graphic Only\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=73 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/553339v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6c03d2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16eeefborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bcd95org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e60be4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Single-cell sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity by providing a micro-level perspective over the past decades. Although heterogeneity is essential for various biological communities, the currently demonstrated platform predominantly focuses on eukaryotic cells without cell walls and their transcriptomics 1,2, leaving significant gaps in the study of omics from other single biological entities such as bacteria and viruses. Due to the difficulty of isolating and acquiring their DNA3, contemporary methodologies for the characterization of generic biological entities remain conspicuously constrained, with low throughput4, compromised lysis efficiency5, and highly fragmented genomes6. Herein, we present the Generic Single Entity Sequencing platform (GSE-Seq), which boasts ample versatility, high throughput, and high coverage, and is enabled by an innovative workflow, addressing the critical challenges in single entities sequencing: (1) one-step manufacturing of massive barcodes, (2) degradable hydrogel-based in situ sample processing and whole genome amplification, (3) integrated in-drop library preparation, (4) compatible long-read sequencing. By GSE-Seq, we have achieved a significant milestone by enabling high-throughput, long-read single-entity profiling of dsDNA and ssDNA from single virus sequencing (SV-seq) and single bacteria sequencing (SB-seq) of the human gut and marine sediment for the first time. Notably, our analysis uncovered previously overlooked viral and bacterial dark matter and phage-host interactions. In summary, the presented conceptually new workflow offers a toolbox based on droplet microfluidics to tackle the persistent challenges in high-throughput profiling to generic applications, which hold immense promise for diverse biological entities, especially hard-to-lyse cells.",

Here we used primary BMDMs from mice in which HDAC6 is ablated or impaired and found that inflammasome activation was largely normal.

    "abstract": "COVID-19 patients present higher risk for myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome, and stroke for up to 1 year after SARS-CoV-2 infection. While the systemic inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection likely contributes to this increased cardiovascular risk, whether SARS-CoV-2 directly infects the coronary vasculature and attendant atherosclerotic plaques to locally promote inflammation remains unknown. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (vRNA) is detectable and replicates in coronary atherosclerotic lesions taken at autopsy from patients with severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 localizes to plaque macrophages and shows a stronger tropism for arterial lesions compared to corresponding perivascular fat, correlating with the degree of macrophage infiltration. In vitro infection of human primary macrophages highlights that SARS-CoV-2 entry is increased in cholesterol-loaded macrophages (foam cells) and is dependent, in part, on neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). Furthermore, although viral replication is abortive, SARS-CoV-2 induces a robust inflammatory response that includes interleukins IL-6 and IL-1{beta}, key cytokines known to trigger ischemic cardiovascular events. SARS-CoV-2 infection of human atherosclerotic vascular explants recapitulates the immune response seen in cultured macrophages, including pro-atherogenic cytokine secretion. Collectively, our data establish that SARS-CoV-2 infects macrophages in coronary atherosclerotic lesions, resulting in plaque inflammation that may promote acute CV complications and long-term risk for CV events.",

    "abstract": "Tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2) plays a vital role in stabilizing extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins through enzymatic crosslinking during tissue growth, repair, and inflammation. TG2 also binds non-covalently to fibronectin (FN), an essential component of the ECM, facilitating cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and survival. However, the interaction between TG2 and fibrillar FN remains poorly understood, as most studies have focused on soluble or surface-adsorbed FN or FN fragments, which differ in their conformations from insoluble FN fibers. Using a well-established in vitro FN-fiber stretch assay, we discovered that the binding of a crosslinking enzyme to ECM fibers is mechano-regulated. TG2 binding to FN is tuned by the mechanical tension of FN fibers, whereby TG2 predominantly co-localizes to low-tension FN fibers, while fiber stretching reduces their affinity for TG2. This mechano-regulated binding relies on the proximity between the N-terminal {beta}-sandwich and C-terminal {beta}-barrels of TG2. Crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) revealed a novel TG2-FN synergy site within TG2s C-terminal {beta}-barrels that interacts with FN regions outside of the canonical gelatin binding domain, specifically FNI2 and FNIII14-15. Combining XL-MS distance restraints with molecular docking reveals the mechano-regulated binding mechanism between TG2 and modules FNI7-9 by which mechanical forces regulate TG2-FN interactions. This highlights a previously unrecognized role of TG2 as a tension sensor for FN fibers. This novel interaction mechanism has significant implications in physiology and mechanobiology, including how force regulate ECM deposition and maturation, and how TG2 mediates cell-ECM adhesion in health and in various pathophysiological processes.

    "abstract": "The goal of designing safer, more effective drugs has led to tremendous interest in molecular mechanisms through which ligands can precisely manipulate signaling of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest class of drug targets. Decades of research have led to the widely accepted view that all agonists--ligands that trigger GPCR activation--function by causing rearrangement of the GPCRs transmembrane helices, opening an intracellular pocket for binding of transducer proteins. Here we demonstrate that certain agonists instead trigger activation of free fatty acid receptor 1 by directly rearranging an intracellular loop that interacts with transducers. We validate the predictions of our atomic-level simulations by targeted mutagenesis; specific mutations which disrupt interactions with the intracellular loop convert these agonists into inverse agonists. Further analysis suggests that allosteric ligands could regulate signaling of many other GPCRs via a similar mechanism, offering rich possibilities for precise control of pharmaceutically important targets.",

    "abstract": "We previously showed that the germ cell specific nuclear protein RBMXL2 represses cryptic splicing patterns during meiosis and is required for male fertility. It has remained unknown whether RBMXL2 evolved its role in splicing repression to deal with the transcriptionally permissive environment of meiosis or might fulfil a function required in all cells. RBMXL2 evolved from the X-linked RBMX gene, which is silenced during meiosis due to sex chromosome inactivation. Here we find that like RBMXL2, RBMX primarily operates as a splicing repressor in somatic cells, and specifically regulates a distinct class of exons that exceed the median human exon size. RBMX protein-RNA interactions are enriched within ultra-long exons, particularly within genes involved in genome stability, and RBMX represses the selection of cryptic splice sites that would compromise gene function. These similarities in overall function suggested that RBMXL2 during meiosis might replace the otherwise ubiquitous RBMX protein. To test this prediction we carried out inducible expression of RBMXL2 and the more distantly related RBMY protein in somatic cells, finding each could rescue aberrant patterns of RNA processing in response to RBMX depletion. The C-terminal disordered domain of RBMXL2 is sufficient to rescue proper splicing control after RBMX depletion. Our data indicate that RBMXL2 replaces RBMX during meiosis, and these proteins have maintained parallel roles that must have been conserved over at least 200 million years of mammalian evolution. We propose RBMX family proteins are important for the splicing inclusion of ultra-long exons because these are particularly susceptible to disruption by cryptic splice site selection.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveEmerging evidence has documented the beneficial effects of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on reducing cardiovascular events. Beyond glucose regulation, the mechanisms behind their cardioprotective effects still remained unresolved. This study aims to investigate whether these benefits are mediated by their effects on vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) functions.\n\nApproach and ResultsTreatment of non-diabetic rats with empagliflozin (a SGLT2 inhibitor) attenuated balloon injury-induced neointimal formation in carotid arteries. In vitro, treatment of rat VSMCs with empagliflozin reduced platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced proliferation and migration. Moreover, empagliflozin-treated VSMCs did not undergo apoptosis and cytosis. Notably, treating VSMCs with empagliflozinsuppressed the activation of PDGF-related signaling, such as that related to the phosphorylation of PDGF receptor b (PDGF-Rb), Akt, and STAT3. Furthermore, overactivation of PDGF-related signaling attenuated the inhibitory effects of empagliflozin on VSMC proliferation and migration. The relevant in vitro findings were corroborated in the neointima of empagliflozin-treated rats. The fact that minimal SGLT2 was discovered in rat VSMCs and SGLT2 silencing did not alter the effect of empagliflozin supported the SGLT2-independent effect of empagliflozin on VSMC functions.\n\nConclusionsThis study highlights the crucial role of PDGF-related signaling in mediating the beneficial effects of empagliflozin on VSMC functions and/or neointimal formation, which are independent of its effects on SGLT2 and glucose metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Endosomal membrane trafficking is mediated by specific protein coats and formation of actin-rich membrane domains. The Retromer complex coordinates with sorting nexin (SNX) cargo adaptors including SNX27, and the SNX27-Retromer assembly interacts with the WASH complex which nucleates actin filaments establishing the endosomal reycling domain. Crystal structures, modelling, biochemical and cellular validation reveal how the FAM21 subunit of WASH interacts with both Retromer and SNX27. FAM21 binds the FERM domain of SNX27 using acidic-Asp-Leu-Phe (aDLF) motifs similar to those found in the SNX1 and SNX2 subunits of the ESCPE-1 complex. Overlapping FAM21 repeats and a specific Pro-Leu containing motif bind three distinct sites on Retromer involving both the VPS35 and VPS29 subunits. However, mutation of the major VPS35-binding site does not inhibit cargo recycling, indicating that a network of redundant interactions promote endosomal activity of the WASH complex. These studies establish the molecular basis for how SNX27-Retromer is coupled to the WASH complex via overlapping and multiplexed motif-based interactions required for the dynamic assembly of endosomal membrane recycling domains.",

However, how TGF-{beta}1 signaling and cholesterol metabolism affects each other in MASLD is yet unknown.\n\nDesignChanges in transcription of genes associated with cholesterol metabolism were assessed by RNA-Seq of AML12 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes (MPH) treated with TGF-{beta}1. Functional assays were performed on AML12 cells (untreated, TGF-{beta}1 treated, or subjected to cholesterol enrichment (CE) or depletion (CD)), and on mice injected with adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8)-Control/TGF-{beta}1.\n\nResultsTGF-{beta}1 inhibited mRNA expression of several cholesterol metabolism regulatory genes, including rate-limiting enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis in AML12 cells, MPHs, and AAV8-TGF-{beta}1-treated mice. Total cholesterol levels in AML12 cells, as well as lipid droplet accumulation in AML12 cells and AAV-treated mice were also reduced. Smad2/3 phosphorylation following 2 h TGF-{beta}1 treatment persisted after CE or CD and was mildly increased following CD, while TGF-{beta}1-mediated AKT phosphorylation (30 min) was inhibited by CE. Furthermore, CE protected AML12 cells from several effects mediated by 72 h incubation with TGF-{beta}1, including EMT, actin polymerization, and apoptosis. CD mimicked the outcome of long term TGF-{beta}1 administration, an effect that was blocked by an inhibitor of the type I TGF-{beta} receptor. Additionally, the supernatant of CE- or CD-treated AML12 cells inhibited or promoted, respectively, the activation of LX-2 hepatic stellate cells.\n\nConclusionTGF-{beta}1 inhibits cholesterol metabolism while cholesterol attenuates TGF-{beta}1 downstream effects in hepatocytes.",

    "abstract": "Viral and cellular particles too large to freely diffuse have two different types of mobility in the eukaryotic cell cytoplasm: directed motion mediated by motor proteins moving along cytoskeletal elements with the particle as its load, and motion in random directions mediated by motor proteins interconnecting cytoskeletal elements. The latter motion is referred to as \"active diffusion.\" Mechanisms of directed motion have been extensively studied compared to mechanisms of active diffusion, despite the observation that active diffusion is more common for many viral and cellular particles. Our previous research showed that active diffusion of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) in the cytoplasm consists of hopping between traps and that actin filaments and myosin II motors are components of the hop-trap mechanism. This raises the question whether similar mechanisms mediate random motion of larger particles with different physical and biological properties. Live-cell fluorescence imaging and a variational Bayesian analysis used in pattern recognition and machine learning were used to determine the molecular mechanisms of random motion of VSV inclusion bodies and cellular early endosomes. VSV inclusion bodies are liquid-liquid phase separated compartments that are the major sites of viral RNA synthesis, and early endosomes are representative of cellular membrane-bound organelles. Like VSV RNPs, inclusion bodies and early endosomes moved from one trapped state to another, but the distance between states was inconsistent with hopping between traps, indicating that the apparent state-to-state movement is mediated by trap movement. Like VSV RNPs, treatment with the actin filament depolymerizing inhibitor latrunculin A increased VSV inclusion body mobility by increasing the size of the traps. In contrast neither treatment with latrunculin A nor depolymerization of microtubules by nocodazole treatment affected the size of traps that confine early endosome mobility, indicating that intermediate filaments are likely major trap components for these cellular organelles.",

    "abstract": "Correct intestinal morphogenesis depends on the early embryonic process of gut rotation, an evolutionarily conserved program in which a straight gut tube elongates and forms into its first loops. However, the gut tube requires guidance to loop in a reproducible manner. The dorsal mesentery (DM) connects the gut tube to the body and directs the lengthening gut into stereotypical loops via left-right (LR) asymmetric cellular and extracellular behavior. The LR asymmetry of the DM also governs blood and lymphatic vessel formation for the digestive tract, which is essential for prenatal organ development and postnatal vital functions including nutrient absorption. Although the genetic LR asymmetry of the DM has been extensively studied, a divider between the left and right DM has yet to be identified. Setting up LR asymmetry for the entire body requires a Lefty1+ midline barrier to separate the two sides of the embryo--without it, embryos have lethal or congenital LR patterning defects. Individual organs including the brain, heart, and gut also have LR asymmetry, and while the consequences of left and right signals mixing are severe or even lethal, organ-specific mechanisms for separating these signals are not well understood. Here, we uncover a midline structure composed of a transient double basement membrane, which separates the left and right halves of the embryonic chick DM during the establishment of intestinal and vascular asymmetries. Unlike other basement membranes of the DM, the midline is resistant to disruption by intercalation of Netrin4 (Ntn4). We propose that this atypical midline forms the boundary between left and right sides and functions as a barrier necessary to establish and protect organ asymmetry.",

Here, we applied palaeoproteomics to investigate an ancient human skeletal individual with severe oral pathology, focusing our research on bacterial pathogenic factors and host defense response. This female skeleton, from the Okhotsk period (i.e., 5th-13th century) of Northern Japan, poses relevant amounts of abnormal dental calculus deposition and exhibits oral dysfunction due to severe periodontal disease. A shotgun mass-spectrometry analysis identified 81 human proteins and 15 bacterial proteins from the calculus of the subject. We identified two pathogenic or bioinvasive proteins originating from two of the three \"red complex\" bacteria, the core species associated with severe periodontal disease in modern humans, as well as two additional bioinvasive proteins of periodontal-associated bacteria. Moreover, we discovered defense response system-associated human proteins, although their proportion was mostly similar to those reported in ancient and modern human individuals with lower calculus deposition. These results suggest that the bacterial etiology was similar and the host defense response was not necessarily more intense in ancient individuals with significant amounts of abnormal dental calculus deposition.",

    "abstract": "Sexual conflict plays a key role in the dynamics of adaptive evolution in sexually reproducing populations, and theory suggests an important role for variance in resource acquisition in generating or masking sexual conflict over fitness and life history traits. Here, I used a quantitative genetic genotype x environment experiment in Drosophila melanogaster, to test the theoretical prediction that variance in resource acquisition mediates variation in sex-specific component fitness. Holding larval conditions constant, I found that adult nutritional environments characterized by high protein content resulted in reduced survival of both sexes compared to an environment of lower protein content, and lower male reproductive success. Despite reduced mean fitness of both sexes in high protein environments, I found a sex*treatment interaction for the relationship between resource acquisition and fitness; estimates of the adaptive landscape indicate males were furthest from their optimum resource acquisition level in high protein environments, and females were furthest in low protein environments. Expression of genetic variance in resource acquisition and survival was highest for each sex in the environment it was best adapted to, although the treatment effects on expression of genetic variance eroded in the path from resource acquisition to total fitness. Cross-sex genetic correlations were strongly positive for resource acquisition, survival, and total fitness, and negative for mating success, although estimation error was high for all. These results demonstrate that environmental effects on resource acquisition can have predictable consequences for the expression of sex-specific genetic variance, but also that these effects of resource acquisition can erode through the life history.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental and unresolved question in regenerative biology is how tissues return to homeostasis after injury. Answering this question is essential for understanding the etiology of chronic disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases and cancer. We used the Drosophila midgut to investigate this question and discovered that during regeneration a subpopulation of cholinergic enteric neurons triggers Ca2+ currents among enterocytes to promote return of the epithelium to homeostasis. Specifically, we found that down-regulation of the cholinergic enzyme Acetylcholinesterase in the epithelium enables acetylcholine from defined enteric neurons, referred as ARCENs, to activate nicotinic receptors in enterocytes found near ARCEN- innervations. This activation triggers high Ca2+ influx that spreads in the epithelium through Inx2/Inx7 gap junctions promoting enterocyte maturation followed by reduction of proliferation and inflammation. Disrupting this process causes chronic injury consisting of ion imbalance, Yki activation and increase of inflammatory cytokines together with hyperplasia, reminiscent of inflammatory bowel diseases. Altogether, we found that during gut regeneration the conserved cholinergic pathway facilitates epithelial Ca2+ waves that heal the intestinal epithelium. Our findings demonstrate nerve- and bioelectric-dependent intestinal regeneration which advance the current understanding of how a tissue returns to its homeostatic state after injury and could ultimately help existing therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The topological organization of the genome plays an important role in regulating gene expression. However, the connection between the two remains poorly understood. X-chromosome inactivation is a unique model system to explore the interlink between topologically associated domains (TADs) and gene expression. TADs are largely lost upon X-inactivation, and the inactive-X gets bipartitely reorganized into two large mega domains. However, the X-inactivation center (XIC) harbors two TADs - at the locus of long non-coding RNA Xist (Xist-TAD) and Tsix (Tsix-TAD). Xist is the master regulator of X-inactivation, which coat the inactive-X and facilitates heterochromatinization. Here, we deleted Xist upstream sequences ([~]6 kb) near the Xist TADs boundary in extraembryonic endoderm stem cells (XEN), which undergo imprinted X-inactivation. This deletion led to the major rearrangement of TADs and affected the expression of genes located within Xist and Tsix TAD, specially the expression of Xist was upregulated, suggesting TADs are essential for proper transcriptional regulation. On the other hand, Xist-upstream deletion on the inactive-X resulted in dispersal of Xist coating and loss of enrichment of repressive chromatin marks on the inactive-X but no effect on X-linked gene silencing. However, we found that autosomal genes were dysregulated in Xist-upstream deleted cells, probably because of misregulation of genes located in Xist and Tsix-TAD, specially Xist. We conclude that Xist upstream sequences are necessary for proper organization of the TADs at the XIC, maintenance of Xist coating/expression and autosomal gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Vascular wilt disease incited by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. carthami (Foc) in Safflower poses a significant threat to its production in India. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular underpinning of compatible and incompatible interaction is of extreme economic importance. In the present study, the genome of a virulent (IARI-5175) and a avirulent (F-00845) Foc strain were sequenced and assembled using data generated from Illumina in combination with Nanopore technologies and HiC. Foc genomes were assembled into 88 and 23 scaffolds with an estimated total size of 46 Mb and 42 Mb respectively for IARI-5175 and F-00845 strains. Reference based mapping of Foc genome with F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol) resulted in chromosomal level ordering of genome and simultaneous identification of accessory genome. Additionally, two lineage specific chromosomes were also identified for virulent Foc strain IARI-5175. Genomic comparisons were made on the basis of effectors, CAZymes, secondary metabolites and mycotoxins to understand the global view pathogenicity in Foc. Moreover, the transcriptome of Foc during compatible and incompatible interaction was sequenced and analyzed leading to the identification of differentially regulated genes. Taken together our study laid a solid foundation to explore novel effector genes that play a crucial role in the establishment of disease and can further be used as targets to devise new strategies to curb wilt disease in safflower.",

    "abstract": "Although Streptomyces is one of the most extensively studied genera of bacteria, their taxonomy remains contested and is suspected to contain significant species-level misclassification. Resolving the classification of Streptomyces would benefit many areas of study and applied microbiology that rely heavily on having an accurate ground truth classification of similar and dissimilar organisms, including comparative genomics-based searches for novel antimicrobials in the fight against the ongoing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis. To attempt a resolution, we investigate taxonomic conflicts between 16S rRNA and whole genome classifications using all available 48,981 full-length 16S rRNA Streptomyces sequences from the combined SILVA, Greengenes, Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) and NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) databases, and 2,276 publicly available Streptomyces genome assemblies. We construct a 16S gene tree for 14,239 distinct Streptomyces 16S rRNA sequences, identifying three major lineages of Streptomyces, and find that existing taxonomic classifications are inconsistent with the tree topology. We also use these data to delineate 16S and whole genome landscapes for Streptomyces, finding that 16S and whole-genome classifications of Streptomyces strains are frequently in disagreement, and in particular that 16S zero-radius Operational Taxonomic Units (zOTUs) are often inconsistent with Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI)-based taxonomy. Our results strongly imply that 16S rRNA sequence data does not map to taxonomy sufficiently well to delineate Streptomyces species reliably, and we propose that alternative markers should instead be adopted by the community for classification and metabarcoding. As much of current Streptomyces taxonomy has been determined or supported by historical 16S sequence data and may in parts be in error, we also propose that reclassification of the genus by alternative approaches is required.\n\nImpact StatementAccurate classification of microbes, usually in the form of taxonomic assignments, provides a fundamental ground truth or reference point for many aspects of applied microbiology including comparative genomics, identification of strains for natural product discovery, and dereplication of strains. Bacteria belonging to the genus Streptomyces are an important source of bioactive metabolites and enzymes in biotechnology, and proper understanding of their phylogeny aids understanding of the evolution of industrially important gene products and metabolites, and prioritization of strains for industrial exploitation. Taxonomic classification in the genus Streptomyces is complex and contested, and there are clear conflicts between taxonomies inferred from 16S rRNA and from whole genome sequences. Despite this, 16S sequence-based classifications are still widely used to infer taxonomic identity, to determine community composition, and to prioritise strains for study. We investigate a diverse and comprehensive set of Streptomyces genomes using whole-genome Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and 16S sequence analysis to delineate and compare classifications made using these approaches. We outline the genomic and 16S sequence landscape of Streptomyces, demonstrating that (i) distinct taxonomic species may share identical full-length 16S sequences, and (ii) in some instances, isolates representing the same taxonomic species do not share any common 16S rRNA sequence. Our results strongly imply that 16S rRNA sequence variation does not map to taxonomy sufficiently well to delineate Streptomyces species reliably, and that alternative markers should instead be adopted by the community. Much of current Streptomyces taxonomy has been determined or supported by historical 16S sequence data, and we therefore propose that reclassification within this group by alternative approaches is required.\n\nData summaryAll code, raw and supporting data are publicly available from GitHub (https://github.com/kiepczi/Kiepas_et_al_2023_16S) and Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8223787).

    "abstract": "DDX3X, a DEAD box-containing RNA helicase, is known to play diverse roles in RNA metabolism, stress response, innate immunity, and cancer. Medulloblastoma is the single most common malignant brain tumor in children. DDX3X is recurrently mutated in the WNT and SHH subgroups of medulloblastoma. CRISPR-Cas9 mediated DDX3X knockout was successful in the HEK293FT cells but generated only non-truncating indels in the medulloblastoma cells suggesting DDX3X is necessary for the viability of the cells. Downregulation of DDX3X expression using shRNA also brought about a considerable reduction in proliferation, clonogenic potential, and anchorage-independent growth of the medulloblastoma cells. Thus, DDX3X expression was found to be essential for the survival, growth, and malignant potential of the medulloblastoma cells consistent with the non-truncating nature of medulloblastoma-associated DDX3X mutations. The medulloblastoma-associated DDX3X mutants were found to be defective in their ability to drive the translation of mRNAs with complex 5-UTR that is dependent on the ATP-dependent helicase activity of DDX3X. These helicase defective DDX3X mutants could restore the expression of interferon signaling genes and malignant potential lost upon DDX3X knockdown in medulloblastoma cells. Their N-terminal domain is intact and was found to be functional in stress granule formation. DDX3X mutants upregulated expression of malignancy-related genes suggesting tumor suppressive role for the helicase activity in the medulloblastoma pathogenesis. Inhibitors of the N-terminal domain of DDX3X which is essential for the viability of medulloblastoma cells could have therapeutic potential in the treatment of WNT and SHH subgroup medulloblastomas.",

    "abstract": "Piperacillin-Tazobactam is a {beta}-lactam/{beta}-lactamase inhibitor combination which is amongst the most prescribed antimicrobials in hospital medicine. Piperacillin is inactivated by commonly carried resistance enzymes, but tazobactam inhibits these allowing successful treatment. The effect of piperacillin on Gram-negative bacteria has been widely studied, but less attention has been paid to the effects of tazobactam. We used a massive transposon mutagenesis approach (TraDIS-Xpress) to determine the genes in Escherichia coli that affect survival when exposed to piperacillin and tazobactam, separately and together. We found significant differences in the selective pressure of the two drugs: a striking finding was that multiple efflux pump families and regulators were essential for survival in the presence of tazobactam, but only one efflux system was beneficial for piperacillin. Additionally, we identified the shikimate kinase AroK as a potential target for tazobactam. This method also found that genes involved in DNA replication and repair reduced E. coli susceptibility to a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam, not seen from either drug treatment alone. Treatment of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae with piperacillin and/or tazobactam selected for mutants with reduced susceptibility, and SNP analyses supported the TraDIS-Xpress findings that tazobactam selects for changes in membrane permeability and maintenance associated with multidrug-resistance. Increased efflux activity is an important foundation of multidrug resistance in human pathogens, therefore the finding that tazobactam can select for this is concerning. These findings could have consequences for antibiotic prescription and should inform the development of future {beta}-lactamase inhibitors to reduce the global increase in multidrug-resistant infections.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive primary CNS malignancies. Despite advances in treatment protocols, clinical outcomes have not followed. Key obstacles remain - namely, the understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME), in which tumor associated macrophages and their interactions with T cells have been of great interest. Although previous studies examining TAMs in GBM have shown that certain types are associated with certain clinical and/or pathologic features [2], these studies have used the outdated M1/M2 paradigm of macrophage polarization and failed to include the continuum of TAM states in GBM, and especially how they interact with T cells. Therefore, the present paper used single-cell RNA sequencing data from adult IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with the primary aim of deciphering the cellular interactions of the 7 TAM subtypes with T cells inside the GBM TME. Furthermore, the interactions discovered herein are compared to IDH-mutated astrocytoma, allowing for focus on the cellular ecosystem unique to GBM. The resulting ligand-receptor interactions, signaling sources, and global communication patterns discovered provide a framework for future studies to explore methods in leveraging the immune system for treating GBM.",

    "abstract": "The assembly and maintenance of neural circuits is crucial for proper brain function. Although the assembly of brain circuits has been extensively studied, much less is understood about the mechanisms controlling their maintenance as animals mature. In the olfactory system, the axons of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing the same odor receptor converge into discrete synaptic structures of the olfactory bulb (OB) called glomeruli, forming a stereotypic odor map. The OB projection neurons, called mitral and tufted cells (M/Ts), have a single dendrite that branches into a single glomerulus, where they make synapses with OSNs. We genetically eliminated more than 95% of M/Ts in early postnatal mice, and observed that the assembly of the OB bulb circuits occurred normally. However, as the animals became adults the apical dendrite of remaining M/Ts grew multiple branches that innervated several glomeruli, and OSNs expressing single odor receptors projected their axons into multiple glomeruli, disrupting the olfactory sensory map. Moreover, ablating the M/Ts in adult animals also resulted in similar structural changes in the projections of remaining M/Ts and axons from OSNs Surprisingly, the ability of these mice to detect odors was relatively preserved despite only having 1-5% of projection neurons transmitting odorant information to the brain, and having highly disrupted circuits in the OB. These results indicate that a reduced number of projection neurons does not affect normal assembly of the olfactory circuit, but induces structural instability of the olfactory circuitry of adult animals.",

Multi-area neurophysiological measurement systems with high temporal resolution are indispensable, especially for dissecting inter-region functional connectivity. Here, we develop a cross-region all-optical physiology system (CRAOP) that enables the simultaneous recording and manipulation of single-neuron activities in multiple brain areas. Based on spatiotemporal multiplexing, our system enables all-optical analysis in the cortex and hippocampus with a high frame rate and minimal time delay in inter-layer imaging and photostimulation. Combined with behavioural experiments, CRAOP provides all-optical evidence linking behavioural responses to neuronal connectivity in the primary visual cortex (V1) in live mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CRAOP can perturb the activity response of interregional cortical neurons to sensory stimuli according to their functional signatures. Overall, CRAOP provides an optical approach for mapping interlayer connectivity at the single-neuron level and for modifying neuronal responses in behaving animals.",
