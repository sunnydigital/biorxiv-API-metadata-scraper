    "abstract": "Proteins are dynamic biomolecules that can transform between different conformational states when exerting physiological functions, which is difficult to simulate by using all-atom methods. Coarse-grained G[o]-like models are widely-used to investigate large-scale conformational transitions, which usually adopt implicit solvent models and therefore cannot explicitly capture the interaction between proteins and surrounding molecules, such as water and lipid molecules. Here, we present a new method, named Switching G[o]-Martini, to simulate large-scale protein conformational transitions between different states, based on the switching G[o] method and the coarse-grained Martini 3 force field. The method is straight-forward and efficient, as demonstrated by the benchmarking applications for multiple protein systems, including glutamine binding protein (GlnBP), adenylate kinase (AdK), and {beta}2-adrenergic receptor ({beta}2AR). Moreover, by employing the Switching G[o]-Martini method, we can not only unveil the conformational transition from the E2Pi-PL state to E1 state of the Type 4 P-type ATPase (P4-ATPase) flippase ATP8A1-CDC50, but also provide insights into the intricate details of lipid transport.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBreast tumors overexpressing human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) confer intrinsic resistance to endocrine therapy (ET), and patients with HER2/ estrogen receptor-positive (HER2+/HR+) breast cancer (BCa) are less responsive to ET than HER2-/ER+. However, real-world evidence reveals that a large subset of HER2+/ER+ patients receive ET as monotherapy, positioning this treatment pattern as a clinical challenge. In the present study, we developed and characterized two distinct in vitro models of ET-resistant (ETR) HER2+/ER+ BCa to identify possible therapeutic vulnerabilities.\n\nMethodsTo mimic ETR to aromatase inhibitors (AI), we developed two long-term estrogen-deprived (LTED) cell lines from BT-474 (BT474) and MDA-MB-361 (MM361). Growth assays, PAM50 molecular subtyping, genomic and transcriptomic analyses, followed by validation and functional studies, were used to identify targetable differences between ET-responsive parental and ETR-LTED HER2+/ER+ cells.\n\nResultsCompared to their parental cells, MM361 LTEDs grew faster, lost ER, and increased HER2 expression, whereas BT474 LTEDs grew slower and maintained ER and HER2 expression. Both LTED variants had reduced responsiveness to fulvestrant. Whole-genome sequencing of the more aggressive MM361 LTED model system identified exonic mutations in genes encoding transcription factors and chromatin modifiers. Single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated a shift towards non-luminal phenotypes, and revealed metabolic remodeling of MM361 LTEDs, with upregulated lipid metabolism and antioxidant genes associated with ferroptosis, including GPX4. Combining the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 with anti-HER2 agents induced significant cell death in both the MM361 and BT474 LTEDs.\n\nConclusionsThe BT474 and MM361 AI-resistant models capture distinct phenotypes of HER2+/ER+ BCa and identify altered lipid metabolism and ferroptosis remodeling as vulnerabilities of this type of ETR BCa.",

    "abstract": "DFNB61 is a recessively inherited nonsyndromic hearing loss caused by mutations in SLC26A5, the gene that encodes the voltage-driven motor protein, prestin. Prestin is abundantly expressed in the auditory outer hair cells that mediate cochlear amplification. Two DFNB61-associated SLC26A5 variants, p.W70X and p.R130S, were identified in patients who are compound heterozygous for these nonsense and missense changes (SLC26A5W70X/R130S). Our recent study showed that mice homozygous for p.R130S (Slc26a5R130S/R130S) suffer from hearing loss that is ascribed to significantly reduced motor kinetics of prestin. Given that W70X-prestin is nonfunctional, compound heterozygous Slc26a5R130S/- mice were used as a model for human SLC26A5W70X/R130S. By examining the pathophysiological consequences of p.R130S prestin when it is the sole allele for prestin protein production, we determined that this missense change results in progressive outer hair cell loss in addition to its effects on prestins motor action. Thus, this study fully defines the pathogenic roles for the p.R130S prestin, which points to the presence of a limited time window for potential clinical intervention.",

    "abstract": "The central nervous system is a master regulator of peripheral homeostasis and cellular-stress responses; however, the contexts for which this regulatory capability evolved remain unknown. The olfactory sensory nervous system has access to privileged information about environmental conditions and can signal to the periphery to prepare for potential metabolic perturbations. The unfolded protein response of the mitochondria (UPRMT) is upregulated upon infection by many pathogens and in metabolic flux, and pathogenic infection and metabolic byproducts are a present hazard in consuming nutrients. Therefore, we asked whether the olfactory nervous system in C. elegans regulates the UPRMT cell nonautonomously. We found that loss of a single olfactory neuron pair, AWC, led to robust induction of the UPRMT downstream of enhanced, serotonin-dependent mitophagy. Further, AWC ablation confers resistance to the pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa partially dependent on the UPRMT transcription factor atfs-1, and fully dependent on mitophagy machinery pdr-1/Parkin. These data demonstrate a novel role for the olfactory nervous system in regulating whole-organism mitochondrial dynamics, perhaps in preparation for postprandial metabolic stress or pathogenic infection.",

Despite their crucial roles in maintaining immune homeostasis, the cell therapy potential of human ILC210 has not been demonstrated, due to both limited numbers in human peripheral blood and lack of definitive markers for identification. Here, we isolate and expand circulating human ILC210, and assess their cell therapy potential in a humanized model of Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD). Cell therapy with human ILC210 decreased GVHD severity and prolonged survival of NOD-scid IL2R{gamma}null (NSG) mice. Adoptive transfer of ILC210 inhibited pathogenic T cell proliferation and intestinal infiltration, and suppressed CD4+ Th1 and CD8+ Tc1 cells in an IL-4 and IL-10 dependent manner. Critically, increased proportions of ILC2s did not correlate with higher rates of cancer relapse in HSCT recipients, and adoptive transfer of ILC210 did not compromise graft-versus-leukemic (GVL) effects in a humanized model. Finally, we identify CD49d and CD86 as novel markers that discriminate ILC210 from conventional ILC2s. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of harnessing ILC210 in cell therapies for GVHD and other immune-driven pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is an essential cellular pathway that enables signaling and recycling of transmembrane proteins and lipids. During endocytosis, dozens of cytosolic proteins come together at the plasma membrane, assembling into a highly interconnected network that drives endocytic vesicle biogenesis. Recently, multiple labs have reported that early endocytic proteins form liquid-like condensates, which provide a flexible platform for the efficient assembly of endocytic vesicles. Given the importance of this network in the dynamics of endocytosis, how might cells regulate its stability? Many receptors and endocytic proteins are ubiquitylated, while early endocytic proteins such as Eps15 contain ubiquitin-interacting motifs. Therefore, we examined the influence of ubiquitin on the stability of the early endocytic protein network. In vitro, we found that recruitment of small amounts of polyubiquitin dramatically increased the stability of Eps15 condensates, suggesting that ubiquitylation could nucleate endocytic sites. In live cell imaging experiments, a version of Eps15 that lacked the ubiquitin-interacting motif failed to rescue defects in endocytic initiation created by Eps15 knockout. Furthermore, fusion of Eps15 to a deubiquitinase enzyme destabilized nascent endocytic sites within minutes. These results suggest that ubiquitylation drives assembly of the flexible protein network responsible for catalyzing endocytic events. More broadly, this work illustrates a biophysical mechanism by which ubiquitylated transmembrane proteins at the plasma membrane could regulate the efficiency of endocytic recycling.",

    "abstract": "While depolarization of neuronal membrane is known to evoke the neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles, hyperpolarization is regarded as a resting state of chemical neurotransmission. Here we report that hyperpolarizing neurons can actively signal neural information by employing undocked hemichannels. We show that UNC-7, a member of the innexin family in Caenorhabditis elegans, functions as a hemichannel in thermosensory neurons and transmits temperature information from the thermosensory neurons to their post-synaptic interneurons. By monitoring neural activities in freely behaving animals, we find that hyperpolarizing thermosensory neurons inhibit the activity of the interneurons and that UNC-7 hemichannels regulate this process. UNC-7 is required to control thermotaxis behavior and functions independently of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Our findings suggest that innexin hemichannels mediate neurotransmission from hyperpolarizing neurons in a manner that is distinct from the synaptic transmission, expanding the way of neural circuitry operations.",

Here we show that molecularly-defined thalamic neurons differentiate in the second trimester of human development, and that these neurons organize into spatially and molecularly distinct nuclei. We identify major subtypes of glutamatergic neuron subtypes that are differentially enriched in anatomically distinct nuclei.

    "abstract": "A comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of multiple intracellular structures or proteins is a promising approach to provide a deeper understanding of and new insights into cellular polarity. In this study, we developed an image analysis pipeline to obtain intensity profiles of fluorescent probes along the apical-basal axis in elongating Arabidopsis thaliana zygotes based on two-photon live-cell imaging data. This technique showed the intracellular distribution of actin filaments, mitochondria, microtubules, and vacuolar membranes along the apical-basal axis in elongating zygotes from the onset of cell elongation to just before asymmetric cell division. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the quantitative data on intracellular distribution revealed that the zygote may be compartmentalized into two parts, with a boundary located 43.6% from the cell tip, immediately after fertilization. To explore the biological significance of this compartmentalization, we examined the positions of the asymmetric cell divisions from the dataset used in this distribution analysis. We found that the cell division plane was reproducibly inserted 20.5% from the cell tip. This position corresponded well with the midpoint of the compartmentalized apical region, suggesting a potential relationship between the zygote compartmentalization, which begins with cell elongation, and the position of the asymmetric cell division.",

    "abstract": "Renal fibrosis is a common pathological endpoint in chronic kidney disease (CKD) that is challenging to reverse. Although myofibroblasts are mainly responsible for the accumulation of a fibrillar collagen-rich extracellular matrix (ECM) in fibrotic kidney, recent studies have unveiled their diversity in terms of proliferative and fibrotic characteristics. This diversity could be linked with the existence of different metabolic states, and myofibroblast metabolic reprogramming may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of renal fibrosis. Here, we reveal an unexpected role of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase WWP2 in the metabolic reprogramming of myofibroblasts during renal fibrosis. The tubulointerstitial expression of WWP2 contributes to the progression of fibrosis in CKD patients, and in pre-clinical murine models of CKD. WWP2 deficiency increases fatty acid oxidation and activates the pentose phosphate pathway, boosting mitochondrial respiration at the expense of glycolysis. This concurrently promotes myofibroblast proliferation and halts pro-fibrotic activation, reducing the severity of kidney fibrosis. Mechanistically, WWP2 suppresses the transcription of PGC-1, a metabolic mediator shaping myofibroblast fibrotic response. Pharmacological interventions targeting PGC-1 reverse the effects of WWP2 on fibrotic myofibroblasts. These findings demonstrate the influence of WWP2 on essential metabolic pathways involved in fibrogenesis, uncovering the WWP2-PGC-1 axis that orchestrates the metabolic reprogramming of myofibroblasts during renal fibrosis. Our study presents a potential novel target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of chronic kidney disease.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=177 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/554242v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (52K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1847ffeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ef029aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@93e0f1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@950d49_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIWWP2 expression is elevated in the tubulointerstitium of fibrotic kidneys and contributes to CKD pathogenesis and progression.\nC_LIO_LIWWP2 uncouples the pro-fibrotic activation and cell proliferation in renal myofibroblasts.\nC_LIO_LIWWP2 controls mitochondrial respiration in renal myofibroblasts through the metabolic regulator PGC-1\nC_LIO_LIMyofibroblast metabolic reprogramming mediates the effect of WWP2 on fibrotic myofibroblasts.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes help maintain cellular proteostasis, and defects in lysosomal positioning and function lead to diseases including neurodegenerative disorders. The spatiotemporal distribution of lysosomes is regulated by small GTPases, including Rabs, which are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). DENN domain-bearing proteins are the largest family of Rab GEFs. Using a cell-based assay, we screened the DENN domain protein family member DENND6A for potential GEF activity toward all 60 Rabs and identified 20 potential DENND6A substrates, including Rab34. Here, we demonstrate that DENND6A activates Rab34, which recruits a RILP/dynein complex to the lysosomes, promoting lysosomal retrograde trafficking from the cell periphery to the minus ends of microtubules. Further, we identify DENND6A as an effector of Arl8b, a major regulatory GTPase on lysosomes. Initially known for promoting anterograde transport of lysosomes, Arl8b also facilitates lysosomal retrograde transport. We demonstrate that Arl8b recruits DENND6A to peripheral lysosomes to activate Rab34 and initiate retrograde transport, regulating nutrient-dependent lysosomal juxtanuclear repositioning and loss of DENND6A impairs autophagic flux. Our findings support a model whereby Arl8b/DENND6A/Rab34-dependent lysosomal retrograde trafficking controls autophagy.",

    "abstract": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is a cytosolic protein complex that regulates innate immune signaling in response to diverse pathogenic insults through the proteolytic processing and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1{beta}. Hyperactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling is implicated in the onset and pathogenesis of numerous diseases, motivating the discovery of new strategies to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activity. We sought to define the potential for the proteostasis regulator AA147 to inhibit the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. AA147 is a pro-drug that is metabolically converted to a reactive metabolite at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to covalently modify ER-localized proteins such as protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs). We show that AA147 inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activity in monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages through a mechanism involving impaired assembly of the active inflammasome complex. This inhibition is mediated through AA147-dependent covalent modification of PDIA1. Genetic depletion or treatment with other highly selective PDIA1 inhibitors similarly blocks NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. Our results identify PDIA1 as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling implicated in etiologically diverse diseases.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila larvae are an established model system for studying the mechanisms of innate and simple forms of learned behaviour. They have about 10 times fewer neurons than adult flies, and it was the low total number of their neurons that allowed for an electron microscopic reconstruction of their brain at synaptic resolution. Regarding the mushroom body, a central brain structure for associative learning in insects, it turned out that more than half of the classes of synaptic connection had previously escaped attention. Understanding the function of these circuit motifs, subsequently confirmed in adult flies, is an important current research topic. In this context, we test larval Drosophila for their cognitive abilities in three tasks that are characteristically more complex than those previously studied. Our data provide evidence for (i) conditioned inhibition, as has previously been reported for adult flies and honeybees. Unlike what is described for adult flies and honeybees, however, our data do not provide evidence for (ii) sensory preconditioning or (iii) second-order conditioning in Drosophila larvae. We discuss methodological features of our experiments as well as four specific aspects of the organisation of the larval brain that may explain why these two forms of learning are observed in honeybees and adult flies, but not in larval Drosophila.",

Alterations in hippocampal excitation-inhibition balance (EIB) have recently been linked to early AD pathology.\n\nObjectiveExamine how AD risk factors (age, APOE-{varepsilon}4, amyloid-{beta}) relate to hippocampal EIB in cognitively normal males and females using connectome-level measures.\n\nMethodsIndividuals from the OASIS-3 cohort (age 42-95) were studied (N = 437), with a subset aged 65+ undergoing neuropsychological testing (N = 231).\n\nResultsIn absence of AD risk factors (APOE-{varepsilon}4/A{beta}+), whole-brain EIB decreases with age more significantly in males than females (p = 0.021, {beta} = -0.007). Regression modeling including APOE-{varepsilon}4 allele carriers (A{beta}-) yielded a significant positive AGE-by-APOE interaction in the right hippocampus for females only (p = 0.013, {beta} = 0.014), persisting with inclusion of A{beta}+ individuals (p = 0.012, {beta} = 0.014).

Results suggest APOE-{varepsilon}4 disrupts hippocampal balance more than amyloid in females. Increased excitation correlates positively with neuropsychological performance in the female group, suggesting a duality in terms of potential beneficial effects prior to cognitive impairment. This underscores the translational relevance of APOE-{varepsilon}4 related hyperexcitation in females, potentially informing therapeutic targets or early interventions to mitigate AD progression in this vulnerable population.",

    "abstract": "Selective attention relies on neural mechanisms that facilitate processing of behaviorally relevant sensory information while suppressing irrelevant information, consistently linked to alpha-band oscillations in human M/EEG studies. We analyzed cortical alpha responses from intracranial electrodes implanted in eight epilepsy patients, who performed a visual spatial attention task. Electrocorticographic data revealed a spatiotemporal dissociation between attention-modulated alpha desynchronization, associated with the enhancement of sensory processing, and alpha synchronization, associated with the suppression of sensory processing, during the cue-target interval. Dorsal intraparietal areas contralateral to the attended hemifield primarily exhibited a delayed and sustained alpha desynchronization, while ventrolateral extrastriatal areas ipsilateral to the attended hemifield primarily exhibited an earlier and sustained alpha synchronization. Analyses of cross-frequency coupling between alpha phase and broadband high-frequency activity (HFA) further revealed cross-frequency interactions along the visual hierarchy contralateral to the attended locations. Directionality analyses indicate that alpha phase in early and extrastriatal visual areas modulated HFA power in downstream visual areas, thus potentially facilitating the feedforward processing of an upcoming, spatially predictable target. In contrast, in areas ipsilateral to the attended locations, HFA power modulated local alpha phase in early and extrastriatal visual areas, with suppressed interareal interactions, potentially attenuating the processing of distractors. Our findings reveal divergent alpha-mediated neural mechanisms underlying target enhancement and distractor suppression during the deployment of spatial attention, reflecting enhanced functional connectivity at attended locations, while suppressed functional connectivity at unattended locations. The collective dynamics of these alpha-mediated neural mechanisms play complementary roles in the efficient gating of sensory information.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSelective attention relies on neural mechanisms involved in target enhancement and distractor suppression to guide behavior. Using electrocorticographic data in humans, we show a spatiotemporal dissociation between cortical activities engaged in target facilitation and distractor inhibition during attentional deployment. We also found that, at attended locations, interareal interactions are enhanced through cross-frequency coupling along the visual hierarchy to potentially facilitate the processing of a spatially predictable target. In contrast, at unattended locations, intraareal interactions are enhanced through cross-frequency coupling, and interareal interactions are suppressed, together to potentially attenuate the processing of distractors. Our findings reveal that such a distributed cortical organization and complementary neural mechanisms enable efficient gating and filtering of sensory information in the anticipatory processing of spatial attention.",

    "abstract": "The combination of brain organoid and single cell omic technologies holds transformative potential to dissect human neurobiology at high resolution and with mechanistic precision. Delivering this promise in the context of human neurodiversity, physiological and pathological alike, requires however a major leap in scalability, given the need for experimental designs that include multiple individuals and, prospectively, population cohorts. To lay the foundation for this, we implemented and benchmarked complementary strategies to multiplex brain organoids. Following an extended longitudinal design with a uniquely informative set of timepoints, we pooled cells from different induced pluripotent stem cell lines either during organoids generation (upstream multiplexing in mosaic models) or before single cell-RNAseq library preparation (downstream multiplexing). We developed a new method, SCanSNP, and an aggregated call to deconvolve organoids cell identities, overcoming current criticalities in doublets prediction and low quality cells identification and improving accuracy over state of the art algorithms. Integrating single cell transcriptomes and analysing cell types across neurodevelopmental stages and multiplexing modalities, we validated the feasibility of both multiplexing methods in charting neurodevelopmental trajectories at high resolution, linking their specificity to genetic variation between individual lines. Together, this multiplexing suite of experimental and computational methods provides an enabling resource for disease modelling at scale and paves the way towards an in vitro epidemiology paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), a disorder characterized by direct shunts between arteries and veins, are associated with genetic mutations. However, the mechanisms leading to the transformation of a capillary into a shunt remain unclear and how shunts can be reverted into capillaries is poorly understood. Here, we report that oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) protocol leads to the consistent and stereotypical formation of AV shunts in non-genetically altered mice. OIR-induced AV shunts show all the canonical markers of AVMs. Genetic and pharmacological interventions demonstrated that changes in endothelial cell (EC) volume of venous origin (hypertrophic venous cells) are the initiating step promoting AV shunt formation, whilst EC proliferation or migration played minor roles. Inhibition of mTOR pathway prevents pathological increases in EC volume and significantly reduces the formation of AV shunts. Importantly, we demonstrate that ALK1 signaling cell-autonomously regulates EC volume, demonstrating that our discoveries link with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)-related AVMs. Finally, we demonstrate that a combination of EC volume control and EC migration is associated with the regression of AV shunts.\n\nWe demonstrate that an increase in the EC volume is the key mechanism driving the initial stages of AV shunt formation, leading to asymmetric capillary diameters. Based on our results, we propose a coherent and unifying timeline leading to the fast conversion of a capillary vessel into an AV shunt. Our data advocates for further investigation into the mechanisms regulating EC volume in health and disease as a way to identify therapeutic approaches to prevent and revert AVMs.",

However, the causes of increased brain iron remain unclear.

Quantitative susceptibility mapping was used to quantify regional brain iron. To assess systemic iron, haematocrit, plasma ferritin and plasma soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) were measured and total body iron index (TBI) was calculated. To assess systemic inflammation, C-reactive protein (CRP), Neutrophil/Lymphocyte ratio (NLR), plasma macrophage colony stimulating factor 1 (MCSF), plasma interleukin 6 (IL6) and plasma interleukin 1{beta} (IL1{beta}) were measured.\n\nResultsFemales exhibited associations between TBI and iron levels in the left and right caudate and right pallidum.

However, it remains unclear how the brain encodes rule information and uses this information to guide behavioral responses to sensory stimuli. Here, we made single-unit recordings while head-fixed mice performed a cross-modal sensory selection task in which they switched between two rules in different blocks of trials: licking in response to tactile stimuli applied to a whisker while rejecting visual stimuli, or licking to visual stimuli while rejecting the tactile stimuli. Along a cortical sensorimotor processing stream including the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory areas, and the medial (MM) and anterolateral (ALM) motor areas, the single-trial activity of individual neurons distinguished between the two rules both prior to and in response to the tactile stimulus. Variable rule-dependent responses to identical stimuli could in principle occur via appropriate configuration of pre-stimulus preparatory states of a neural population, which would shape the subsequent response. We hypothesized that neural populations in S1, S2, MM and ALM would show preparatory activity states that were set in a rule-dependent manner to cause processing of sensory information according to the current rule. This hypothesis was supported for the motor cortical areas by findings that (1) the current task rule could be decoded from pre-stimulus population activity in ALM and MM; (2) neural subspaces containing the population activity differed between the two rules both prior to the stimulus and during the stimulus-evoked response; and (3) optogenetic disruption of pre-stimulus states within ALM and MM impaired task performance.

    "abstract": "The integrated stress response (ISR) is a conserved pathway in eukaryotic cells that is activated in response to multiple sources of cellular stress. Although acute activation of this pathway restores cellular homeostasis, intense or prolonged ISR activation perturbs cell function and may contribute to neurodegeneration. DNL343 is an investigational CNS-penetrant small molecule ISR inhibitor designed to activate the eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) and suppress aberrant ISR activation. DNL343 reduced CNS ISR activity and neurodegeneration in a dose-dependent manner in two established in vivo models - the optic nerve crush injury and an eIF2B loss of function (LOF) mutant - demonstrating neuroprotection in both and preventing motor dysfunction in the LOF mutant mouse. Treatment with DNL343 at a late stage of disease in the LOF model reversed elevation in plasma biomarkers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration and prevented premature mortality. Several proteins and metabolites that are dysregulated in the LOF mouse brains were normalized by DNL343 treatment, and this response is detectable in human biofluids. Several of these biomarkers show differential levels in CSF and plasma from patients with vanishing white matter disease (VWMD), a neurodegenerative disease that is driven by eIF2B LOF and chronic ISR activation, supporting their potential translational relevance. This study demonstrates that DNL343 is a brain penetrant ISR inhibitor capable of attenuating neurodegeneration in mouse models and identifies several biomarker candidates that may be used to assess treatment responses in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Detecting causal relations structures our perception of events in the world. Here, we determined whether generalized or specialized visual routines underly the perception of causality by assessing the adaptability of specific features in launching events of simple geometric shapes. After prolonged viewing to causal launch events (the adaptor) defined by a particular set of features (i.e., a particular motion direction, motion speed, or feature conjunction), observers were less likely to see causal interactions in subsequent ambiguous test events. We assessed whether this negative aftereffect transfers to test events with a new set of feature values that were not presented during adaptation. Processing in specialized (as opposed to generalized) visual routines predicts that the transfer of adaptation depends on the feature-similarity of the adaptor and the test event. We show that negative aftereffects do not transfer to unadapted launch directions. Crucially, adaptation was contingent on the causal impression in launches as demonstrated by a lack of adaptation in non-causal control events. In contrast, adaptation to launches with a particular motion speed transferred also to a different speed. Moreover, adaptation based on feature conjunctions (color and launch direction) revealed that launch direction trumps the feature identity of the object for causal perception; the adaptation transferred across colors if the test event had the same motion direction as the adaptor. In summary, visual adaptation allowed us to carve out a visual feature space underlying the perception of causality and revealed specialized visual routines that are tuned to a launchs motion direction.",

    "abstract": "Epileptic seizures induce aberrant neurogenesis from resident neural stem cells (NSCs) in the dentate gyrus of the adult mouse hippocampus, which has been implicated in depletion of the NSC pool and impairment of hippocampal function. However, the mechanisms regulating neurogenesis after seizures remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that Shh from mossy cells is a major source of Shh signaling activity after seizures, by which mossy cells contribute to seizure-induced neurogenesis and maintenance of the NSC pool. Deletion of Shh from mossy cells attenuates seizure-induced neurogenesis. Moreover, in the absence of Shh from mossy cells, NSCs pool are prematurely depleted after seizure-induced proliferation, and NSCs have impaired self-renewal. Likewise, lack of Shh from mossy cells accelerates age-related decline of the NSC pool with accompanying reduction of self-renewal of NSCs outside the context of pathology such as seizures. Together, our findings indicate that Shh from mossy cells is critical to maintain NSCs and to prevent exhaustion from excessive consumption in aging and after seizures.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in older adults, and the need for effective, sustainable therapeutic targets is imperative. Pharmacologic inhibition of C5aR1 reduces plaque load, gliosis and memory deficits in animal models. However, the cellular basis underlying this neuroprotection and which processes were the consequence of amyloid reduction vs alteration of the response to amyloid were unclear. In the Arctic model, the C5aR1 antagonist PMX205 did not reduce plaque load, but deficits in short-term memory in female mice were prevented. Hippocampal single cell and single nucleus RNA-seq clusters revealed C5aR1 dependent and independent gene expression and cell-cell communication. Microglial clusters containing neurotoxic disease-associated microglial genes were robustly upregulated in Arctic mice and drastically reduced with PMX205 treatment, while genes in microglia clusters that were overrepresented in the Arctic-PMX205 vs Arctic group were associated with synapse organization and transmission and learning. PMX205 treatment also reduced some A-1 astrocyte genes. In spite of changes in transcript levels, overall protein levels of some reactive glial markers were relatively unchanged by C5aR1 antagonism, as were clusters associated with protective responses to injury. C5aR1 inhibition promoted signaling pathways associated with cell growth and repair, such as TGF{beta} and FGF, in Arctic mice, while suppressing inflammatory pathways including PROS, Pecam1, and EPHA. In conclusion, pharmacologic C5aR1 inhibition prevents cognitive loss, limits microglial polarization to a detrimental inflammatory state and permits neuroprotective responses, as well as leaving protective functions of complement intact, making C5aR1 antagonism an attractive therapeutic strategy for individuals with AD.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryPharmacologic inhibition of C5aR1 suppresses disease-enhancing processes and promotes disease mitigating pathways in an aggressive model of Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorylation of receptor-like kinases (RLKs) plays an important role in the regulation of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Arabidopsis thaliana FLAGELLIN-SENSITIVE2 (FLS2) is a typical RLK that can sense a conserved 22 amino acid sequence in the N-terminal region of flagellin (flg22) to initiate plant defense pathways. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of FLS2 phosphorylation activity at the plasma membrane in response to flg22 remain largely enigmatic. Here, by single-particle tracking, we demonstrated that Ser-938 phosphorylation site affected flg22-induced FLS2 spatiotemporal dynamics and dwell time. Furthermore, using Forster resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime (FRET-FLIM) imaging microscopy coupled with protein proximity indexes (PPI), we revealed that the degree of co-localization of FLS2/FLS2S938D-GFP with AtRem1.3-mCherry increased in response to flg22, whereas FLS2S938A-GFP did not show significant changes, indicating that Ser-938 phosphorylation site facilitates efficient sorting of FLS2 into nanodomains. Importantly, we found that the Ser-938 phosphorylation of FLS2 significantly increased flg22-induced internalization and immune responses. Taken together, these results illustrate that the phosphorylated site of FLS2 regulates the partitioning of FLS2 into functional membrane nanodomains to activate flg22-induced plant immunity.",

    "abstract": "Lymphatic vessels play a role in several physiological and pathological processes including tissue fluid homeostasis, dietary fat absorption, immunosurveillance, and immunomodulation. During embryonic development, lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) precursors are distinguished from blood endothelial cells by the expression of the transcription factor Prospero-related homeobox 1 (PROX1). PROX1 is essential for lymphatic vascular network formation in mouse and zebrafish. The initiation of PROX1 expression precedes LEC sprouting and migration, serving as the definitive marker of specified LECs. Despite its crucial role in lymphatic development, the upstream regulation of PROX1 in LECs remains to be uncovered. SOX18 and COUP-TFII are thought to regulate Prox1 expression in mice by binding to its promoter region. However, how the specificity of Prox1 expression to LECs is achieved remains to be studied in detail.\n\nIn this study, we analysed evolutionary conservation and chromatin accessibility to identify enhancer sequences located in the proximity of zebrafish prox1a active in developing LECs. We confirmed the functional role of the identified sequences through CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of a lymphatic valve enhancer. The deletion of this genomic region results in impaired valve morphology and function. Overall, our results reveal the intricate control of prox1a expression through a collection of enhancers. Ray-finned fish-specific distal enhancers drive pan-lymphatic expression, while vertebrate-conserved proximal enhancers refine expression in functionally distinct subsets of lymphatic vessels.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=89 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/550483v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fed780org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f62a8dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@163b04corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cb7f87_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Germ cell apoptosis in C. elegans hermaphrodites is a physiological process eliminating around 60% of all cells in meiotic prophase to maintain tissue homeostasis. In contrast to programmed cell death in the C. elegans soma, the selection of germ cells undergoing apoptosis is stochastic.\n\nBy live-tracking individual germ cells at the pachytene stage, we found that germ cells smaller than their neighbors are selectively eliminated through apoptosis before differentiating into oocytes. Thus, cell size is a strong predictor of physiological germ cell death. The RAS/MAPK and ECT/RHO/ROCK pathways together regulate germ cell size by controlling actomyosin constriction at the apical rachis bridges, which are cellular openings connecting the syncytial germ cells to a shared cytoplasmic core. Enhancing apical constriction reduces germ cell size and increases the rate of cell death while inhibiting the actomyosin network in the germ cells prevents their death. We propose that actomyosin contractility at the rachis bridges of the syncytial germ cells amplifies intrinsic disparities in cell size. Through this mechanism, animals can adapt the rate of germ cell death and differentiation to changing environmental conditions.",

The 3D resolving capability was realized through a combination of optical and computational sectioning techniques tailored for our low-power imaging system. We applied the imaging technique to 1.2 cm-wide section of mouse brain, and successfully observed various regions of the brain with sub-cellular resolution in a single FOV. We also performed time-lapse imaging of a 1-cm-wide vascular network during quail embryo development for over 24 hours, visualizing the movement of over 4.0 x 105 vascular endothelial cells and quantitatively analyzing their dynamics.

    "abstract": "Asexually replicating stages of most malaria (Plasmodium spp.) parasite species replicate synchronously within the red blood cells of their vertebrate host. Rhythmicity in this intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC) enables parasites to maximise exploitation of the host and align transmission activities with the time of day that mosquito vectors blood feed. The IDC is also responsible for the major pathologies associated with malaria, and plasticity in the parasites rhythm can confer tolerance to antimalarial drugs. Both the severity of infection (virulence) and synchrony of the IDC vary across species and between genotypes of Plasmodium, yet this variation is poorly understood. Theory predicts that virulence and IDC synchrony are negatively correlated and we tested this hypothesis using two closely related genotypes of the rodent malaria model Plasmodium chabaudi that differ markedly in virulence. We also test the predictions that in response to perturbations to the timing (phase) of the IDC schedule relative to the phase of host rhythms (misalignment), the virulent parasite genotype recovers the correct phase relationship faster, incurs less fitness loss, and so, hosts benefit less from misalignment of the virulent genotype. Our predictions are partially supported; the virulent parasite genotype was less synchronous in some circumstances and recovered faster from misalignment. While hosts were less anaemic when infected by misaligned parasites, the extent of this benefit did not depend on parasite virulence. Overall, our results suggest that interventions to perturb the alignment between the IDC schedule and host rhythms, and increase synchrony between parasites within each IDC, could alleviate disease symptoms. However, virulent parasites, which are better at withstanding conventional antimalarial treatment, would also be intrinsically better able to tolerate such interventions.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY PARAGRAPHPhosphorus plays a crucial role in controlling biological productivity, but geological estimates of phosphate concentrations in the Precambrian ocean, during lifes origin and early evolution, vary over several orders of magnitude1-10. While reduced phosphorus species may have served as alternative substrates to phosphate11, their bioavailability on the early Earth remains unknown. Here, we reconstruct the phylogenomic record of life on Earth and find that phosphate transporting genes (pnas) evolved in the mid-Archean (ca. 3.2 Ga) and are consistent with phosphate concentrations above modern levels (>3 M). The first gene optimized for low phosphate levels (pstS; <1 M) appeared around 2.9 Ga. Most enzymatic pathways for metabolising reduced phosphorus emerged and expanded across the tree of life in the Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic (ca. 2.6 to 1.8 Ga). This includes phosphonate-catabolising CP-lyases, phosphite-oxidising pathways and hypophosphite-oxidising pathways. CP-lyases are particularly abundant in dissolved phosphate concentrations below 0.1 M. Our results thus indicate declining phosphate levels through the Archean, possibly linked to increasing deposition of phosphate-scavenging iron oxides, which may have limited productivity. However, reduced phosphorus species did not become widely used until after the Paleoproterozoic Great Oxidation Event (2.3 Ga), possibly linked to an expansion of the biosphere at that time.",

    "abstract": "The ability of mitochondria to coordinate inter-tissue signaling of stress responses is critical to organismal health and longevity. In C. elegans, neurons experiencing mitochondrial stress elicit an inter-tissue signaling pathway that activates the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRMT) in peripheral cells, which promotes organismal health and lifespan. Neurons experiencing mitochondrial stress release mitokine stress signals, such as serotonin or the WNT ligand EGL-20. In peripheral receiving cells, canonical WNT signaling is required to induce the UPRMT. However, a dichotomy exists because the developmental program regulated by WNT signaling is not induced. Therefore, how WNT signaling can be diverged to regulate the UPRMT and not developmental programs is unknown. We find that germline mitochondria play a pivotal role in mediating inter-tissue stress signaling between neurons and the intestine downstream of WNT signaling mechanisms. Through a mutagenesis screen, we identified the mitochondrial complex III subunit ucr-2.3 as essential for mediating inter-tissue UPRMT signaling. In C. elegans, ucr-2.3 is primarily expressed in neurons and the germline tissue. Surprisingly, we find that only germline-expressed ucr-2.3, not neuronal, mediates cell nonautonomous UPRMT signaling downstream of neuronal factors. Additionally, intact germline tissue was also required for cell nonautonomous UPRMT signaling, suggesting a general role of germline and germline mitochondria for cell nonautonomous mitochondrial stress signaling. Finally, we find that germline mitochondria communicate to the intestine to regulate UPRMT activation through a steroid signaling pathway. Overall, these data propose a model where the germline acts as a central signaling tissue for integrating stress cues from the nervous system to elicit the proper stress responses to maintain organismal integrity. Germline mitochondria, through ucr-2.3, may be a key determinant for the cell nonautonomous UPRMT because of the innate role of mitochondria in germline integrity and inter-tissue signaling.",

    "abstract": "Successful chromosome segregation into gametes depends on tightly-regulated interactions between the parental chromosomes. During meiosis, chromosomes are aligned end-to-end by an interface called the synaptonemal complex, which also regulates exchanges between them. However, despite the functional and ultrastructural conservation of this essential interface, how protein-protein interactions within the synaptonemal complex regulate chromosomal interactions remains poorly understood. Here we describe a novel interaction interface in the C. elegans synaptonemal complex, comprised of short segments of three proteins, SYP-1, SYP-3 and SYP-4. We identified the interface through a saturated suppressor screen of a mutant that destabilizes the synaptonemal complex. The specificity and tight distribution of suppressors point to a charge-based interface that promotes interactions between synaptonemal complex subunits and, in turn, allows intimate interactions between chromosomes. Our work highlights the power of genetic studies to illuminate the mechanisms that underly meiotic chromosome interactions.\n\nSignificance StatementGamete production requires tightly regulated interactions between the parental chromosomes, which co-align and exchange information. These events are mediated by the synaptonemal complex - a thread-like structure that assembles between the parental chromosomes. The molecular interactions that underly synaptonemal complex assembly remain poorly understood due to rapid sequence divergence and challenges in biochemical reconstitution. Here we identify a novel three-component interface in the nematode synaptonemal complex. Destabilization and subsequent restoration of this interface link the integrity of the synaptonemal complex with chromosome alignment and regulation of exchanges. Beyond mechanistic understanding of chromosomal interactions, our work provides a blueprint for genetic probing of large cellular assemblies that are refractory to structural analysis and sheds light on the forces that shape their evolution.",

    "abstract": "In species with large and complex genomes such as conifers, dense linkage maps are a useful for supporting genome assembly and laying the genomic groundwork at the structural, populational and functional levels. However, most of the 600+ extant conifer species still lack extensive genotyping resources, which hampers the development of high-density linkage maps. In this study, we developed a linkage map relying on 21,570 SNP makers in Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis [Bong.] Carr.), a long-lived conifer from western North America that is widely planted for productive forestry in the British Isles. We used a single-step mapping approach to efficiently combine RAD-Seq and genotyping array SNP data for 528 individuals from two full-sib families. As expected for spruce taxa, the saturated map contained 12 linkages groups with a total length of 2,142 cM. The positioning of 5,414 unique gene coding sequences allowed us to compare our map with that of other Pinaceae species, which provided evidence for high levels of synteny and gene order conservation in this family. We then developed an integrated map for P. sitchensis and P. glauca based on 27,052 makers and 11,609 gene sequences. Altogether, these two linkage maps, the accompanying catalog of 286,159 SNPs and the genotyping chip developed herein opens new perspectives for a variety of fundamental and more applied research objectives, such as for the improvement of spruce genome assemblies, or for marker-assisted sustainable management of genetic resources in Sitka spruce and related species.",

We report that in vitro, AbeH (assisted by the flavin reductase AbeF) can chlorinate and brominate tryptophan as well as other indole derivatives and substrates with phenyl and quinoline groups. We solved the X-ray crystal structures of AbeH alone and complexed with FAD, as well as crystal structures of the tryptophan-6-halogenase BorH alone, in complex with 6-chlorotryptophan, and in complex with FAD and tryptophan. Partitioning of FAD and tryptophan into different chains of BorH and failure to incorporate tryptophan into AbeH/FAD crystals suggested that flavin and tryptophan binding are negatively coupled in both proteins. ITC and fluorescence quenching experiments confirmed the ability of both AbeH and BorH to form binary complexes with FAD or tryptophan and the inability of tryptophan to bind to AbeH/FAD or BorH/FAD complexes. FAD could not bind to BorH/tryptophan complexes, but FAD appears to displace tryptophan from AbeH/tryptophan complexes in an endothermic entropically-driven process.",

    "abstract": "Metabolism and biological functions of the nitrogen-rich compound guanidine have long been neglected. The discovery of four classes of guanidine-sensing riboswitches and two pathways for guanidine degradation in bacteria hint at hitherto overlooked but widespread sources of unconjugated guanidine in nature. So far, only three enzymes from a narrow range of bacteria and fungi have been shown to produce guanidine, with the ethylene-forming enzyme as the most prominent example. Here, we show that a related class of Fe2+- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2-ODD-C23) highly conserved among plants and algae catalyze the hydroxylation of homoarginine at the C6-position. Spontaneous decay of 6-hydroxyhomoarginine yields guanidine and 2-aminoadipate-6-semialdehyde. The latter can be reduced to pipecolate by pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase but is more likely to be oxidized to aminoadipate by aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH7B in vivo. Arabidopsis has three 2-ODD-C23 isoforms, among which Din11 is unusual because it also accepted arginine as substrate, which was not the case for the other 2-ODD-C23 isoforms from Arabidopsis or other plants. Guanidine contents were typically between 10 and 20 nmol*(g fresh weight)-1 in Arabidopsis but increased to 100 or 300 nmol*(g fresh weight)-1 after homoarginine feeding or treatment with Din11-inducing methyljasmonate, respectively. In 2-ODD-C23 triple mutants, the guanidine content was strongly reduced, whereas it increased in overexpression plants. We discuss the implications of the finding of widespread guanidine-producing enzymes in photosynthetic eukaryotes as a so far underestimated branch of the bio-geochemical nitrogen cycle and propose possible functions of natural guanidine production.",

This is proposed to be mediated through carbamylation of K125. We show that mutating K125 to glutamate, mimicking the negative charge of carbamylation, causes Cx26 GJCs to be constitutively closed. Through cryo-EM we observe that the K125E mutation pushes a conformational equilibrium towards the channel having a constricted pore entrance, similar to effects seen on raising the partial pressure of CO2. In previous structures of connexins, the cytoplasmic loop, important in regulation and where K125 is located, is disordered. Through further cryo-EM studies we trap distinct states of Cx26 and observe density for the cytoplasmic loop. The interplay between the position of this loop, the conformations of the transmembrane helices and the position of the N-terminal helix, which controls the aperture to the pore, provides a mechanism for regulation.",

These new \"closed and compacted\" conformations afford insights into the interactions between the TCR and the membrane, including conserved surface patches that make extensive outer leaflet contact, and suggest novel conformational regulation by glycans. We show that the closed/compacted conformations, not the extended one previously reported in detergent5-8, represent the unliganded resting state for the TCR in vivo, underscoring the importance of structural interrogation of membrane proteins in native-like environments. We use conformation-locking disulfide mutants to show that juxtamembrane linker extension is necessary for ligand-dependent TCR activation, demonstrating that TCR-intrinsic conformational change is necessary for TCR activation and opening numerous avenues for immunoreceptor engineering.",

In this study, we aimed to design nanoscale constructs based on graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets as platform carriers for the TLR7/8 agonist Resiquimod (R848). The non-covalent complexation of R848 molecules on the GO surface resulted in stable complexes by preserving their biological activity. The physicochemical properties, molecular quantification, as well as the overall performance of the complex were systematically investigated. We hypothesized the formation of GO:drug nano-constructs with strong colloidal stability over time, due to the strong {pi}-{pi} interactions between the R848 molecules and the GO surface, and identified that R848 loading efficiency consistently ranged around 75% (of starting molecules), quantified by HPLC and UV-Vis. The 2D morphology of the thin nanosheets was retained after complexation, determined by various (AFM and SEM) microscopic techniques. Based on the surface physicochemical characterization of the complexes by Raman, FTIR, XPS, and XRD, the formation of non-covalent interactions among the GO surface and the R848 molecules was confirmed. Most importantly, GO:R848 complexes did not compromise the biological activity of R848, and effectively activated macrophages in vitro. Collectively, this study demonstrates that thin GO sheets can act as platforms for the non-covalent association with small TLR7/8 agonist molecules, forming stable and highly reproducible complexes, that could be exploited as effective immunomodulatory agents.",

We tested the anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic activity of macrophage-targeted DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor SGI-1027.\n\nMethods, ResultsSGI-1027 was encapsulated into human serum albumin (HSA) nanoparticles (HSANP) functionalized with the PP1 peptide, a macrophage scavenger receptor 1 ligand, fused to a FLAG epitope (S-HSANP-FLAGPP1). Nanoparticle physico-chemical characteristics predicted good marginalization towards the vascular wall, although SGI-1027 encapsulation efficiency was relatively low ([~]23%). S-HSANP-FLAGPP1 were rapidly internalized compared to non-functionalized and, surprisingly, functionalized void controls, and induced a shift towards an anti-inflammatory profile of secreted cytokines in human THP-1 macrophages. S-HSANP-FLAGPP1 colonized the atheroma and induced a significant [~]44% reduction of atherosclerosis burden in the aortic tree of ApoE-null mice compared to controls. A reduction in aortic root atherosclerosis was observed, although primarily induced by HSANP irrespective of loading or functionalization. No alteration of body weight, non-vascular tissue gross histology, plasma glucose, triglyceride or cholesterol were observed. HSA whether free or structured in nanoparticles, induced a 3-4-fold increase in HDL compared to vehicle.\n\nConclusionsWe confirm that DNMT inhibition is anti-atherogenic and provide proof of principle that targeted HSANP are effective carriers for those molecules. SGI-1027 displayed a novel anti-inflammatory activity that is independent of cell proliferation and therefore likely unrelated to DNMT inhibition. HDL elevation may represent an additional advantage of HSA-based nanocarriers.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoscale lipid bilayer particles secreted by cells. EVs may carry markers of the tissue of origin and its disease state which makes them incredibly promising for disease diagnosis and surveillance. While the armamentarium of EV analysis technologies is rapidly expanding, there remains a strong need for multiparametric analysis with single EV resolution. Nanoprojectile (NP) secondary ion mass spectrometry (NP-SIMS) relies on bombarding a substrate of interest with individual gold NPs resolved in time and space. Each projectile creates an impact crater of 10-20 nm in diameter while molecules emitted from each impact are mass analyzed and recorded as individual mass spectra. We demonstrate the utility of NP-SIMS for analysis of single EVs derived from normal liver cells (hepatocytes) and liver cancer cells. EVs were captured on antibody (Ab)-functionalized gold substrate then labeled with Abs carrying lanthanide (Ln) MS tags (Ab@Ln). These tags targeted four markers selected for identifying all EVs, and specific to hepatocytes or liver cancer. NP-SIMS was used to detect Ab@Ln-tags co-localized on the same EV and to construct scatter plots of surface marker expression for thousands of EVs with the capability of categorizing individual EVs. Additionally, NP-SIMS revealed information about the chemical nano-environment where targeted moieties co-localized. Our approach allowed analysis of population heterogeneity with single EV resolution and distinguishing between hepatocyte and liver cancer EVs based on surface marker expression. NP-SIMS holds considerable promise for multiplexed analysis of single EVs and may become a valuable tool for identifying and validating EV biomarkers of cancer and other diseases.",

    "abstract": "More research is needed to solidify the basis for reasonable metronomic chemotherapy regimens due to the inconsistent clinical outcomes from studies on metronomic chemotherapy with antineoplastic agents, along with signs of a nonlinear dose-response relationship at low doses. The present study therefore explored the dose-response relationships of representative antineoplastic agents in low dose ranges and their underlying mechanisms. Cyclophosphamide (CPA) and 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) were employed to observe the effects of the frequent administration of low-dose antineoplastic agents on tumor growth, tumor angiogenesis, and bone-marrow-derived cell (BMDC) mobilization in mouse models. The effects of antineoplastic agents on tumor and endothelial cell functions with or without BMDCs were analyzed in vitro. Tumor growth and metastasis were significantly promoted after the administration of CPA or 5-Fu at certain low dose ranges, and were accompanied by enhanced tumor angiogenesis and proangiogenic factor expression in tumor tissues, increased proangiogenic BMDC release in the circulating blood, and augmented proangiogenic BMDC retention in tumor tissues. Low concentrations of CPA or 5-Fu were found to significantly promote tumor cell migration and invasion, and enhance BMDC adhesion to endothelial cells in vitro. These results suggest that there are risks in empirical metronomic chemotherapy using low-dose antineoplastic agents.",

    "abstract": "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-synthesizing neurons orchestrate reproduction centrally. They receive commands from various neuronal networks for regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG)-axis. Here we report acetylcholine (ACh) as a critical regulator of GnRH neurons and reproduction in mice. In acute brain slice preparation, the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) agonists, ACh and carbachol, evoked a biphasic effect on the firing rate in GnRH neurons, first increasing afterwards diminishing it. In the presence of tetrodotoxin, carbachol induced an inward current followed by a decline in frequency of mPSCs. RT-PCR and whole cell patch-clamp studies revealed that GnRH neurons expressed both muscarinic (M1-M5) and nicotinic (4{beta}2, 3{beta}4 and 7) ACh receptors. Muscarine via M1 and M3 receptors increased, while via M2 and M4 reduced the frequency of both miniature postsynaptic currents (mPSCs) and firing. The identified nicotinic AChRs contributed to the nicotine-elicited inward current and the rise of firing rate. Optogenetic activation of channelrhodopsin-2-tagged cholinergic axons modified GnRH neuronal activity and evoked co-transmission of ACh and GABA from a subpopulation of boutons. 3DISCO immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy revealed innervation of GnRH neurons by cholinergic axons. Rabies retrograde viral labelling started from GnRH-Cre neurons identified the medial septum and the diagonal band of Broca as exclusive sites of origin for specific cholinergic afferents. In vivo pharmacogenetic activation of cholinergic system resulted in an increased secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) in gonadectomized mice. Our findings collectively corroborate that the central cholinergic system exerts an important regulatory influence upon GnRH neurons and activates the HPG-axis via ACh and ACh/GABA neurotransmissions.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=149 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/554236v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15778faorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c7a352org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b38c97org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d33d90_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhile moderate endurance exercise has been reported to improve cardiovascular health, its effects on cardiac structure and function are not fully characterized, especially with respect to sexual dimorphism. We aimed to assess the effects of moderate endurance exercise on cardiac physiology in male versus female mice.\n\nMethodsC57BL/6J mice of both sexes were run on a treadmill for six weeks. ECG and echocardiography were performed every two weeks. After six weeks of exercise, mice were euthanized, and triple parametric optical mapping was performed on Langendorff perfused hearts to assess cardiac electrophysiology. Arrhythmia inducibility was tested by programmed electrical stimulation. Left ventricular (LV) tissue was fixed, and RNA sequencing was performed to determine exercise-induced transcriptional changes.\n\nResultsExercise-induced LV dilatation was observed in female mice alone, as evidenced by increased LV diameter and reduced LV wall thickness. Increased cardiac output was also observed in female exercised mice but not males. Optical mapping revealed further sexual dimorphism in exercise-induced modulation of cardiac electrophysiology. In female mice, exercise prolonged action potential duration and reduced voltage-calcium influx delay. In male mice, exercise reduced the calcium decay constant, suggesting faster calcium reuptake. Exercise increased arrhythmia inducibility in both male and female mice, however, arrhythmia duration was increased only in females. Lastly, exercise-induced transcriptional changes were sex-dependent: females and males exhibited the most significant changes in contractile versus metabolism-related genes, respectively.\n\nConclusionsOur data suggest that moderate endurance exercise can significantly alter multiple aspects of cardiac physiology in a sex-dependent manner. While some of these effects are beneficial, like improved cardiac mechanical function, others are potentially pro-arrhythmic.",

    "abstract": "Opioids are well-known to cause respiratory depression, but despite clinical evidence of dysphagia, the effects of opioids on swallow excitability and motor pattern are unknown. We sought to test the effects of the clinically-relevant opioid buprenorphine on pharyngeal swallow and respiratory drive in male and female rats. We also evaluated utility of serotonin 5-HT1A agonists (8-OH-DPAT and buspirone) to improve swallowing and breathing outcomes following buprenorphine administration. Experiments were performed on 44 freely breathing Sprague Dawley rats anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. Bipolar fine wire electrodes were inserted into the mylohyoid, thyroarytenoid, posterior cricoarytenoid, thyropharyngeus and diaphragm muscles to measure electromyographic (EMG) activity of swallowing and breathing behaviors. We evaluated the hypotheses that swallow varies by stimulus, opioids depress swallow and breathing, and that 5-HT1A agonists improve these depressions. Our results largely confirmed the hypotheses: 1) Swallow-related muscle activity was larger during swallows elicited by oral water infusion plus esophageal distension than by either stimulus alone. 2) Buprenorphine depressed swallow in both sexes, but most significantly in females. 3) Female animals were more susceptible to buprenorphine-induced respiratory arrest. 4) 8-OH-DPAT rescued breathing following buprenorphine-induced respiratory arrest, and pre-treatment with the partial 5-HT1A agonist buspirone prevented buprenorphine-induced respiratory arrest in female animals. 5) 8- OH-DPAT enhanced swallow-related mylohyoid drive, but did not restore excitability of the swallow pattern generator following total suppression by buprenorphine. Our results highlight sex-specific and behavior-specific effects of buprenorphine and provide pre-clinical evidence of a 5HT1A agonist for the treatment of respiratory depression and dysphagia.\n\nNew & NoteworthyThis is the first manuscript to evaluate sex-specific effects of opioid administration on pharyngeal swallow. We expand on a small but growing number of studies that report a lower threshold for opioid-induced respiratory depression in females than males, and are the first to produce this effect with the partial mu-opioid-receptor agonist buprenorphine. Our study is the first to demonstrate that activation of 5-HT1A receptors can improve swallow and breathing outcomes following systemic buprenorphine administration.",

Monocytes exposed to the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, have a trained immunity phenotype, characterized by an increased biosynthesis of different lipid mediators (LMs) derived from long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Pharmacological and genetic approaches showed that long-chain PUFA synthesis and lipoxygenase (LOX)-derived LMs are crucial for the BCG trained immunity responses of human monocytes. Furthermore, monocytes of healthy individuals vaccinated with BCG are enriched in 12-LOX products.

    "abstract": "The involvement of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)2 in anti-infective bacterial immunity remains largely undetermined compared to other members of the SOCS family. We developed a mouse model expressing the loss of function R96C SOCS2 point mutation to characterize the response of macrophages to Staphylococcus aureus and its TLR-ligand derivatives. The model resumes observations of gigantism done in Socs2-/- mice. Stimulation of bone-marrow-derived macrophages with various TLR-2 ligands showed upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF- production only in cytokine-modulating environments that promote SOCS2 expression. Using this model, we showed that SOCS2 protein reduces STAT-5 phosphorylation in a short time frame upon TLR engagement. When SOCS2 is ablated, neutrophil and F4/80int Ly6C+ inflammatory macrophage recruitment, as well as IFN-{gamma} and IL-10 concentrations are significantly increased upon S. aureus peritoneal infection. By lowering the pro-inflammatory environment, SOCS2 favors better healing during a systemic infection caused by S. aureus.",

    "abstract": "A critical aspect of a successful pandemic response is expedient antibody discovery, manufacturing and deployment of effective lifesaving treatments to patients around the world. However, typical drug discovery and development is a lengthy multi-step process that must align drug efficacy with multiple developability criteria and can take years to complete. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI), and especially machine learning (ML), have great potential to accelerate and improve the optimization of therapeutics, increasing their activity and safety as well as decreasing their development time and manufacturing costs. Here we present a novel, cost-effective and accelerated approach to therapeutic antibody discovery, that couples AI-designed human antibody libraries, biased for improved developability attributes with high throughput and sensitive screening technologies. The applicability of our platform for effective therapeutic antibody discovery is demonstrated here with the identification of a panel of human monoclonal antibodies that are novel, diverse and pharmacologically active. These first-generation antibodies, without the need for affinity maturation, bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with therapeutically-relevant specificity and affinity and display neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 viral infectivity across multiple strains. Altogether, this platform is well suited for rapid response to infectious threats, such as pandemic response.\n\nIMPORTANCEExpedient discovery and manufacturing of lifesaving therapeutics is critical for pandemic response. The recent COVID pandemic has highlighted the current inefficiencies and the need for improvements. To this end, we present our therapeutic antibody discovery platform that couples artificial intelligence (AI) and innovative high throughput technologies, and we demonstrate its applicability to rapid response. This platform enabled the isolation, characterization, and rapid identification of effective broadly neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with good developability attributes, anticipated to fit our current process development and manufacturing platform. As such, this would benefit cost-of-goods and improve therapeutic access to patients. The AI-derived antibodies represent an advantageous therapeutic modality that can be developed and deployed fast, thus well suited for rapid response to infectious threats, such as pandemic response.",

    "abstract": "Structure-guided rational immunogen design can generate optimized immunogens that elicit a desired humoral response. Design strategies often center upon targeting conserved sites on viral glycoproteins that will ultimately confer potent neutralization. For SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-2), the surface-exposed spike glycoprotein includes a broadly conserved portion, the receptor binding motif (RBM), that is required to engage the host cellular receptor, ACE2. Expanding humoral responses to this site may result in a more potently neutralizing antibody response against diverse sarbecoviruses. Here, we used a \"resurfacing\" approach and iterative design cycles to graft the SARS-2 RBM onto heterologous sarbecovirus scaffolds. The scaffolds were selected to vary the antigenic distance relative to SARS-2 to potentially focus responses to RBM. Multimerized versions of these immunogens elicited broad neutralization against sarbecoviruses in the context of preexisting SARS-2 immunity. These validated engineering approaches can help inform future immunogen design efforts for sarbecoviruses and are generally applicable to other viruses.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophils are key first responders to Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Excessive tissue and blood neutrophils are associated with worse histopathology and adverse outcomes, however their functional role during CDI remains poorly defined. Utilizing intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-neutrophil co-cultures and a pre-clinical animal model of CDI, we show that neutrophils exacerbate C. difficile-induced IEC injury. We utilized cutting-edge single-cell transcriptomics to illuminate neutrophil subtypes and biological pathways that could exacerbate CDI-associated IEC damage. As such, we have established the first transcriptomics atlas of bone marrow (BM), blood, and colonic neutrophils after CDI. We found that CDI altered the developmental trajectory of BM and blood neutrophils towards populations that exhibit gene signatures associated with pro-inflammatory responses and neutrophil-mediated tissue damage. Similarly, the transcriptomic signature of colonic neutrophils was consistent with hyper-inflammatory and highly differentiated cells that had amplified expression of cytokine-mediated signaling and degranulation priming genes. One of the top 10 variable features in colonic neutrophils was the gene for neutrophil glycoprotein, Olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4). CDI enhanced OLFM4 mRNA and protein expression in neutrophils, and OLFM4+ cells aggregated to areas of severe IEC damage. Compared to uninfected controls, both humans and mice with CDI had higher concentrations of circulating OLFM4; and in mice, OLFM4 deficiency resulted in faster recovery and better survival after infection. Collectively, these studies provide novel insights into neutrophil-mediated pathology after CDI and highlight the pathogenic role of OLFM4+ neutrophils in regulating CDI-induced IEC damage.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryUtilizing single-cell transcriptomics, IEC-epithelial co-cultures, and pre-clinical models of CDI, we have identified a subset of neutrophils that are marked by OLFM4 expression as pathogenic determinants of IEC barrier damage after CDI.",

    "abstract": "Lumican is an extracellular matrix proteoglycan, known to regulate toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in innate immune cells. In experimental settings, lumican suppresses TLR9 signaling by binding to, and sequestering its synthetic ligand, CpG-DNA, in non-signal permissive endosomes. However, the molecular details of lumican interactions with CpG-DNA are obscure. Here, the 3-D structure of the 22 base-long CpG-DNA (CpG ODN_2395) bound to lumican or TLR9 were modeled using homology modeling and docking methods. Some of the TLR9-CpG ODN_2395 features predicted by our model are consistent with the previously reported TLR9-CpG DNA crystal structure, substantiating our current analysis. Our modeling indicated a smaller buried surface area for lumican-CpG ODN_2395 (1803 A2) compared to that of TLR9-CpG ODN_2395 (2094 A2), implying a potentially lower binding strength for lumican and CpG-DNA than TLR9 and CpG-DNA. The docking analysis identified 32 amino acids in lumican LRR1-11 interacting with CpG ODN_2395, primarily through hydrogen bonding, salt-bridges and hydrophobic interactions. Our study provides molecular insights into lumican and CpG-DNA interactions that may lead to molecular targets for modulating TLR9 mediated inflammation and autoimmunity.",

In fission yeast, they regulate various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, lipid metabolism, and cell adhesion. CSL proteins bind to DNA through their N-terminal Rel-like domain and central beta-trefoil domain. Here, we investigated the importance of DNA binding for CSL functions in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We created CSL mutants with disrupted DNA binding and found that the vast majority of CSL functions depend on intact DNA binding. Specifically, DNA binding is crucial for the regulation of cell adhesion, lipid metabolism, cell cycle progression, long non-coding RNA expression, and genome integrity maintenance. Interestingly, perturbed lipid metabolism leads to chromatin structure changes, potentially linking lipid metabolism to the diverse CSL-associated phenotypes. Our study highlights the critical role of DNA binding for CSL protein functions in fission yeast.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTCSL transcription factors regulate a diverse set of processes, but the mechanisms are not always clear.

Here, we show that the FE is similar among different SG types and contains unique Axin2+ stem cells in a niche at its basal FE-perpendicular flexure (FE-PF). Lineage tracing and ablation assays demonstrate Axin2+ cells as integral for FE homeostasis. Wnt-secretion arrest experiments resulted in FE-obstruction via hyperproliferation and inhibited differentiation inferring FE-PF Axin2+ cells are Wnt-producers maintaining FE-patency. Upon constitutive Axin2+ cell Wnt signalling, FE-PF-specific cell proliferation with early-stage signs of malignancy formed alongside a keratin-plugging FE-obstruction type. While keratin-based obstructions are recognized, inhibited differentiation obstructions are not, which suggests a one-size-fits-all therapeutic approach is not optimal. We offer a molecular identification toolkit to aid anti-obstruction advances in dermatology/ophthalmology and highlight the FE-PF as a skin tumorigenic site.\n\nSummaryThis work characterises a novel site in the skin, its stem cells and niche, a site prone to cancer.

    "abstract": "Type II topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that play a pivotal role in modulating the topological configuration of dsDNA. These Topo enzymes are indispensable for DNA metabolism and have been extensively investigated in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. However, understanding of virus-encoded Topo II remains limited. One intriguing example is the African swine fever virus (ASFV), which stands as the sole mammalian-infecting virus encoding a Topo II. In this work, we utilized multiple approaches involving cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, atomic force microscopy and biochemical assays to investigate the structure and function of ASFV Topo , pP1192R. We determined the structures of pP1192R in different conformational states and confirming its enzymatic activity in vitro. Collectively, our results unveil the basic mechanisms of viral Topo II, thereby not only augmenting our understanding of this kind of intriguing enzymes but also presenting a potential avenue for the intervention strategies to mitigate the impact of African swine fever virus.",

    "abstract": "Cellular processes require precise and specific gene regulation, in which continuous mRNA degradation is a major element. The mRNA degradation mechanisms should be able to degrade a wide range of different RNA substrates with high efficiency, but should at the same time be limited, to avoid killing the cell by elimination of all cellular RNA. RNase Y is a major endoribonuclease in found most Firmicutes, including Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. However, the molecular interactions that direct RNase Y to cleave the correct RNA molecules at the correct position remain unknown. In this work we have identified transcripts that are homologs in S. aureus and B. subtilis, and are RNase Y targets in both bacteria. Two such transcript pairs were used as models to show a functional overlap between the S. aureus and the B. subtilis RNase Y, which highlighted the importance of the nucleotide sequence of the RNA molecule itself in the RNase Y targeting process. We then truncated one model transcript to identify 103 nucleotides that are sufficient for this targeting, and detailed analyses of this region revealed sequence and structural elements that drive cleavage efficiency and fine-tune the positioning of the cleavage to a specific nucleotide bond.",

    "abstract": "Tardigrades are known for their ability to survive remarkable extremes, but relatively little is known about the molecular underpinnings that allow for their extraordinary stress tolerance. We devised an expression cloning approach to screen for novel protectants from desiccation-tolerant tardigrades. We expressed cDNA libraries from the tardigrades Hypsibius exemplaris and Ramazzottius varieornatus in E. coli and subjected the bacteria to desiccation. Sequencing the populations of surviving bacteria revealed enrichment of mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (mtSSBs) from both tardigrade species. Expression of mtSSBs in bacteria improved desiccation survival to similar levels as some of the best protectants known to date. The DNA-binding activity of the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) fold domain of mtSSB was necessary and sufficient to improve desiccation tolerance. By comparing the efficacy of mtSSBs from multiple organisms, we provide evidence that desicco-protection is a conserved feature of mtSSBs. More broadly, any OB-fold containing protein may act similarly to promote desiccation tolerance, likely by coating ssDNA to limit damage during desiccation. These results identify single-stranded DNA-binding activity as a potent contributor to extreme desiccation tolerance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRespiratory infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with a significant proportion thought to have a viral aetiology. Traditional diagnostic approaches often rely on targeted assays for \"common\" respiratory pathogens, leaving a substantial fraction of infections unidentified. Here, we used metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) to characterize the nasopharyngeal virome associated with acute respiratory infection (ARI), with and without a positive PCR test result for a panel of common respiratory viruses.\n\nMethodsNasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic outpatients (n=49), of whom 32 tested positive by a multiplex viral PCR, and asymptomatic controls (n=4) were characterized by mNGS. The virome taxa were stratified into human, non-human eukaryotic host, and bacteriophage sub-groups. We used a phage host classification as a proxy to establish bacterial taxa present in the nasopharynx. We then compared the virome biodiversity and presence of pathogens with known respiratory effects across the participant sub-groups.\n\nResultsThe nasopharyngeal virome exhibited similar diversity across the PCR-positive and - negative subsets. Among the top ARI-associated human viruses were enterovirus (16.3%, human rhinovirus, HRV-A), roseolovirus (14.3%, human betaherpesvirus 7, HBV-7) and lymphocryptovirus (8.16%, Epstein-Barr virus, EBV). The top three ARI-associated phage hosts were Streptococcus spp (32.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24.5%) and Burkholderia spp. (20.4%). The virome of both asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects was also abundant in the Staphylococcus (60.4%) and Propionibacterium (Cutibacterium) acnes bacteriophages (90.6%). The PCR and mNGS results were relatively concordant for human rhinovirus (HRV), but not for other PCR panel targets, including human parainfluenza (HPIV), adenovirus (HAdV), bocavirus (BoV) and seasonal coronavirus (HCoV).\n\nConclusionsmNGS revealed a high diversity of pathogens that could be cause to respiratory symptomatology, either as a single infection or a co-infection between viral and bacterial species. The clinical significance of the mNGS versus multiplex PCR findings warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "The liver is critical for functions that support metabolism, immunity, digestion, detoxification, and vitamin storage. Aging is associated with severity and poor prognosis of various liver diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Previous studies have used multi-omic approaches to study liver diseases or to examine the effects of aging on the liver. However, to date, no studies have used an integrated omics approach to investigate aging-associated molecular changes in the livers of healthy female nonhuman primates. The goal of this study was to identify molecular changes associated with healthy aging in the livers of female baboons (Papio sp., n=35) by integrating multiple omics data types (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) from samples across the adult age span. To integrate omics data, we performed unbiased weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and the results revealed 3 modules containing 3,149 genes and 33 proteins were positively correlated with age, and 2 modules containing 37 genes and 216 proteins were negatively correlated with age. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were positively associated with age, whereas xenobiotic metabolism and melatonin and serotonin degradation pathways were negatively associated with age. The findings of our study suggest that UPR and a reduction in reactive oxygen species generated from serotonin degradation could protect the liver from oxidative stress during the aging process in healthy female baboons.",

    "abstract": "The genetic code for many different proteins can be found in biological sequencing data, which offers vital insight into the genetic evolution of viruses. While machine learning approaches are becoming increasingly popular for many \"Big Data\" situations, they have made little progress in comprehending the nature of such data. One such area is the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE), a generalpurpose approach used to represent high dimensional data in low dimensional (LD) space while preserving similarity between data points. Traditionally, the Gaussian kernel is used with t-SNE. However, since the Gaussian kernel is not data-dependent, it determines each local bandwidth based on one local point only. This makes it computationally expensive, hence limited in scalability. Moreover, it can misrepresent some structures in the data. An alternative is to use the isolation kernel, which is a data-dependent method. However, it has a single parameter to tune in computing the kernel. Although the isolation kernel yields better performance in terms of scalability and preserving the similarity in LD space, it may still not perform optimally in some cases. This paper presents a perspective on improving the performance of t-SNE and argues that kernel selection could impact this performance. We use 9 different kernels to evaluate their impact on the performance of t-SNE, using SARS-CoV-2 \"spike\" protein sequences. With three different embedding methods, we show that the cosine similarity kernel gives the best results and enhances the performance of t-SNE.",

Besides the folded RNA recognition motifs, hnRNPA1 has a [~] 135 amino-acids long low-complexity domain (LCD) consisting of RGG-repeats region and a prion-like domain (PrLD). Biochemical data suggest that RGG-rich region modulates recognition of telomeric repeats, while PrLD is often implicated in formation of biomolecular condensates. Here, we utilize recent experimental data from techniques like NMR, DEER and SAXS on hnRNPA1-LCD and integrated that with [~] 100 {micro}-seconds molecular simulations trajectory data to elucidate the Boltzmann-weighted atomic-resolution conformational ensemble of hnRNP1-LCD and study its interaction with telomeric G-quadruplexes (GQs). Single chain statistics and abundance of molecular motifs as well as consistency with low-resolution experimentally reported structural data suggest faithful recapitulation of local interactions. We observe multi-domain structural architecture for the LCD suggesting that functional modularity may be encoded in very long IDPs. Our binding simulations studies reveal that some conformations from RGG-rich region destabilize telomeric GQ, which may be an important first step in unfolding activities at the telomeric end. Spontaneous appearances of kinked beta sheet motifs within the hnRNPA1-LCD hint at possible nucleation centres of reversible biomolecular condensate formation.",

Despite the ubiquity of density gradient centrifugation in WBC isolation, its influence on WBC functionality remains inadequately understood. This research employs holotomography to explore the effects of two distinct WBC separation techniques, namely conventional centrifugation and microfluidic separation, on the functionality of the isolated cells. We utilize three-dimensional refractive index distribution and time-lapse dynamics to conduct an in-depth analysis of individual WBCs, focusing on their morphology, motility, and phagocytic capabilities. Our observations highlight that centrifugal processes negatively impacts WBC motility and phagocytic capacity, whereas microfluidic separation yields a more favorable outcome in preserving WBC functionality.

    "abstract": "In vivo, cells experience complex tissue environments with various chemical and physical features. They sense and respond to tissue morphology and mechanical properties and adjust their behavior and function based on the surrounding. In contrast to the free environment experienced on 2D substrates commonly used in research, the 3D natural environment represents a major physical obstacle for cells. Here, cells are usually confined either by the extracellular matrix (ECM) or neighboring cells. The importance of such confinements has been demon-strated in the past decades by showing its influence on cell decision-making in many vital biological processes such as migration, division and cytoskeletal reorganization. Despite these insights, the sheer level of complexity faced when studying cell biological questions in biomimetic confined situations, led to an indispensable need for a 3D system which can simulate the in vivo confined condition, while being capable of providing microenvironments with different chemical and physical properties for the cells and capturing the mechanical forces and properties of the studied biological sample. Here we introduce a microconfiner that finally provides a new imaging capacity, namely the confine-ment force microscopy (CFM). We are able to adjust the confinement level in real time during microscopy while measuring not only the the cellular traction but also the cellular compression forces. Furthermore, the chemical and physical properties of the microenvironment can be optimized for the respective questions. We demonstrate the power of this confinement system by the mechanical response of cells, migration analysis of immune cells, the timed force generation during durotaxis driven adhesion switching and the viscoelastic properties of cancer tissue.",

    "abstract": "Programmable intercellular signaling using components of naturally-occurring quorum sensing can allow for coordinated functions to be engineered in microbial consortia. LuxR-type transcriptional regulators are widely used for this purpose and are activated by homoserine lactone (HSL) signals. However, they often suffer from imperfect molecular discrimination of structurally similar HSLs, causing misregulation within engineered consortia containing multiple HSL signals. Here, we studied one such example, the regulator LasR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We elucidated its sequence-function relationship for ligand specificity using targeted protein engineering and multiplexed high-throughput biosensor screening. A pooled combinatorial saturation mutagenesis library (9,486 LasR DNA sequences) was created by mutating six residues in LasRs {beta}5 sheet with single, double, or triple amino acid substitutions. Sort-seq assays were performed in parallel using cognate and non-cognate HSLs to quantify each corresponding sensors response to each HSL signal, which identified hundreds of highly specific variants. Sensor variants identified were individually assayed and exhibited up to 60.6-fold (p = 0.0013) improved relative activation by the cognate signal compared to the wildtype. Interestingly, we uncovered prevalent mutational epistasis and previously unidentified residues contributing to signal specificity. The resulting sensors with negligible signal crosstalk could be broadly applied to engineer bacteria consortia.",

    "abstract": "For nearly two decades, genomic selection has supported efforts to increase genetic gains in plant and animal improvement programs. However, novel phenomic strategies helping to predict complex traits in maize have proven beneficial when integrated into across- and within-environment genomic prediction models. One phenomic data modality is near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which records reflectance values of biological samples (e.g., maize kernels) based on chemical composition. Predictions of seven maize agronomic traits and three kernel composition traits across two years (2011-2012) and two management conditions (water stressed and well-watered) were conducted using combinations of NIRS and genomic data within four different cross-validation prediction scenarios. In aggregate, models incorporating NIRS data alongside genomic data improved predictive ability over models using only genomic data in 5 of 28 trait/cross-validation scenarios for across-environment prediction and 15 of 28 trait/environment scenarios for within-environment prediction, while the model with NIRS data alone had the highest prediction ability in only 1 of 28 scenarios for within-environment prediction. Potential causes of the surprisingly lower phenomic than genomic prediction power in this study are discussed, including sample size, sample homogenization, and low GxE. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) implicated known (i.e., MADS69, ZCN8, sh1, wx1, du1) and unknown candidate genes linked to plant height and flowering-related agronomic traits as well as compositional traits such as kernel protein and starch content. This study demonstrated that including NIRS with genomic markers is a viable method to predict multiple complex traits with improved predictive ability and elucidate underlying biological causes.\n\nKey messageGenomic and NIRS data from a maize diversity panel were used for prediction of agronomic and kernel composition traits while uncovering candidate genes for kernel protein and starch content.",

    "abstract": "The accurate quantification of hypersensitive response (HR) programmed cell death is imperative for understanding plant defense mechanisms and developing disease-resistant crop varieties. In this study, we report an accelerated phenotyping platform for the continuous-time, rapid and quantitative assessment of HR: Parallel Automated Spectroscopy Tool for Electrolyte Leakage (PASTEL). Compared to traditional HR assays, PASTEL significantly improves temporal resolution and has high sensitivity, facilitating the detection of microscopic levels of cell death. We validated PASTEL by transiently expressing the effector protein AVRblb2 in transgenic lines of the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana (expressing the corresponding resistance protein Rpi-blb2) to reliably induce HR. We were able to detect cell death at microscopic intensities, where leaf tissue appeared healthy to the naked eye one week after infiltration. PASTEL produces large amounts of frequency domain impedance data captured continuously (sub-seconds to minutes). Using this data, we developed a supervised machine learning models for classification of HR. We were able to classify input data (inclusive of our entire tested concentration range) as HR-positive or negative with 84.1% mean accuracy (F1 score = 0.75) at 1 hour and with 87.8% mean accuracy (F1 score = 0.81) at 22 hours. With PASTEL and the ML models produced in this work, it is possible to phenotype disease resistance in plants in hours instead of days to weeks.",

    "abstract": "Toxic puffers accumulate tetrodotoxin (TTX), a well-known neurotoxin, by feeding on TTX-bearing organisms and using it to defend themselves from predators. Our previous studies have demonstrated that toxic puffers are attracted to 5,6,11-trideoxytetrodotoxin (TDT), a nontoxic TTX analog that is simultaneously accumulated with TTX in toxic puffers and their prey. In addition, activity labeling using immunohistochemistry targeting neuronal activity marker suggests that TDT activates crypt olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) of the green spotted puffer. However, it remains to be determined whether individual crypt OSNs can physiologically respond to TDT and whether TDT is processed differently from other odors in the brain. By employing electroporation to express GCaMP6s in OSNs, we successfully identified a distinct group of oval OSNs that exhibited a specific calcium response when exposed to TDT in green spotted puffers. These oval OSNs showed no response to amino acids (AAs), which serve as food odor cues for teleosts. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry targeting neural activity markers revealed that TDT and AAs odors activate extensively overlapping areas in the dorsomedial olfactory bulb. These results suggest that while different types of OSNs detect TDT and AAs in the olfactory epithelium, these substances are processed as similar odors in the olfactory bulb. The TDT odor may act as a chemoattractant for finding conspecific toxic puffers and for feeding TTX-bearing organisms for effective toxification.",
