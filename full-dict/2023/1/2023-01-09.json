    "abstract": "African trypanosomes proliferate as bloodstream forms and procyclic forms in the mammal and tsetse fly midgut, respectively. This allows them to colonise the host environment upon infection and ensure life cycle progression. Yet, understanding of the mechanisms that regulate and drive the cell replication cycle of these forms is limited. Using single cell transcriptomics on unsynchronised cell populations, we have obtained high resolution cell cycle regulated transcriptomes of both procyclic and slender bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei without prior cell sorting or synchronisation. Additionally, we describe an efficient freeze-thawing protocol that allows single cell transcriptomic analysis of cryopreserved T. brucei. Computational reconstruction of the cell cycle using periodic pseudotime inference allowed the dynamic expression patterns of cycling genes to be profiled for both life cycle forms. Comparative analyses identify a core cycling transcriptome highly conserved between forms, as well as several genes where transcript levels dynamics are form-specific. Comparing transcript expression patterns with protein abundance revealed that the majority of genes with periodic cycling transcript and protein levels exhibit a relative delay between peak transcript and protein expression. This work reveals novel detail of the cell cycle regulated transcriptomes of both forms, which are available for further interrogation via an interactive webtool.",

    "abstract": "The early Omicron lineage variants evolved and gave rise to diverging lineages that fueled the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022. Bivalent mRNA vaccines, designed to broaden protection against circulating and future variants, were authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2022 and recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in September 2022. The impact of bivalent vaccination on eliciting neutralizing antibodies against homologous BA.4/BA.5 viruses as well as emerging heterologous viruses needs to be analyzed. In this study, we analyze the neutralizing activity of sera collected after a third dose of vaccination (2-6 weeks post monovalent booster) or a fourth dose of vaccination (2-7 weeks post bivalent booster) against 10 predominant/recent Omicron lineage viruses including BA.1, BA.2, BA.5, BA.2.75, BA.2.75.2, BN.1, BQ.1, BQ.1.1, XBB, and XBB.1. The bivalent booster vaccination enhanced neutralizing antibody titers against all Omicron lineage viruses tested, including a 10-fold increase in neutralization of BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 viruses that predominated in the U.S. during the last two months of 2022. Overall, the data indicate the bivalent vaccine booster strengthens protection against Omicron lineage variants that evolved from BA.5 and BA.2 progenitors.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative social behaviours, such as parental care, have long been hypothesized to relax selection leading to the accumulation of genetic variation in populations. Although the idea has been discussed for decades, there has been relatively little experimental work to investigate how social behaviour contributes to genetic variation in populations. Here, we investigate how parental care can shape molecular genetic variation in the subsocial insect Nicrophorus vespilloides. Using whole genome sequencing of populations that had evolved in the presence or absence of parental care for 30 generations, we show that parental care maintains levels of standing genetic variation. In contrast, under a harsh environment without care, strong directional selection caused a reduction in genetic variation. Furthermore, we show that adaptation to the loss of care is associated with genetic divergence between populations at loci related to stress, morphological development and transcriptional regulation. These data reveal how social behaviour is linked to the genetic processes that shape and maintain genetic diversity within populations, and provides rare empirical evidence for an old hypothesis.\n\nLay SummarySocial behaviours, such as parental care, have long been hypothesized to result in the accumulation of genetic variation in populations.

    "abstract": "The genus Macaca, with 23 species assigned into four to seven species groups, exhibits the largest geographic range and represents the most successful adaptive radiation of nonhuman primates. Here, we conducted phylogenomic analyses of 16 newly generated and eight published macaque genomes and found a strong support for the division of this genus into seven species groups. Both ancient hybrid and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) have contributed to the radiation and evolution of macaques. Particularly, the contradicting phylogenetic positions among silenus/nigra, fascicularis/mulatta and arctoides/sinica lineages were likely resulted from high level of ILS and potential hybridization between the ancestors of the arctoides/sinica and silenus/nigra lineages. Furthermore, an integrated scenario for macaque radiation is reconstructed by the help of the dated phylogenetic tree combined with documented history records. This study provides insights into ancient introgression involved in the radiation of macaques, which may help us to understand the rapid speciation of nonhuman primates.",

    "abstract": "Attracting and securing potential mating partners is of fundamental importance for successfully initiating reproduction and thus assuring the passing of genes to the next generation. Therefore, signaling sexual attractiveness is expected to be tightly coordinated in communication systems synchronizing senders and receivers. Chemical signaling has permeated through all taxa of life as the earliest and most wide-spread form of communication and is particularly prevalent in insects. However, it has been notoriously difficult to decipher how exactly information related to sexual signaling is encoded in complex chemical profiles. Similarly, our knowledge of the genetic basis of sexual signaling is very limited and usually restricted to a few case studies with comparably simple pheromonal communication mechanisms. The present study jointly addresses these two knowledge gaps by characterizing a single gene simultaneously impacting sexual attractiveness and complex chemical surface profiles in parasitic wasps. Knocking down a fatty acid synthase gene in female wasps dramatically reduces their sexual attractiveness coinciding with a drastic decrease in male courtship and copulation behavior. Concordantly, we found a striking shift of methyl-branching patterns in the female surface pheromonal compounds, which we subsequently demonstrate to be the main cause for the greatly reduced male response. Intriguingly, this suggests a potential coding mechanism for sexual attractiveness mediated by specific methyl-branching patterns, whose genetic underpinnings are not well understood despite their high potential for encoding information. Our study sheds light on how biologically relevant information can be encoded in complex chemical profiles and on the genetic basis of sexual attractiveness.\n\nSignificance StatementUnraveling the genetic basis of chemical signaling is one of the most prevalent yet challenging topics in functional genetics and animal communication studies. Here we present the characterization of a biosynthetic gene in parasitoid wasps that simultaneously impacts sexual attractiveness as well as majorly shifts complex surface pheromone compositions. The shifted pattern primarily constitutes up- and down-regulated methyl-branched compounds with very distinct branching positions. Therefore, these findings immediately suggest a potential coding mechanism for sexual attractiveness in complex chemical profiles. This advances our understanding of how genetic information can be translated into biologically relevant chemical information and reveals that sexual attractiveness can have a comparably simple genetic basis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Ustilaginales comprise hundreds of plant-parasitic fungi with a characteristic life cycle that directly links sexual reproduction and parasitism: One of the two mating-type loci codes for a transcription factor that not only facilitates mating, but also initiates the infection process. However, several species within the Ustilaginales have no described parasitic stage and were historically assigned to the genus Pseudozyma. Molecular studies have shown that the group is polyphyletic, with members being scattered in various lineages of the Ustilag-inales. Together with recent findings of conserved fungal effectors in these non-parasitic species, this raises the question if parasitism has been lost recently and in multiple independent events or if there are hitherto undescribed parasitic stages of these fungi.\n\nResultsIn this study, we sequenced genomes of five Pseudozyma species together with parasitic species from the Ustilaginales to compare their genomic capability to perform two central functions in sexual reproduction: mating and meiosis. While the loss of sexual capability is assumed in certain lineages and asexual species are common in Asco- and Basidiomycota, we were able to successfully annotate functional mating and meiosis genes that are conserved throughout the whole group.\n\nConclusionOur data suggest that at least the key functions of a sexual lifestyle are maintained in the analyzed genomes, challenging the current understanding of the so-called asexual species with respect to their evolution and ecological role.",

Knockdown of these genes by CRISPRi confirmed their role in cell morphology. Analysis of common variants yielded one significant association and nominated over 300 variants with suggestive evidence (P<10-6) of association with one or more morphology traits.

    "abstract": "The catecholamines dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) have been implicated in neuropsychiatric vulnerability, in part via their roles in mediating the decision making processes. Although the two neuromodulators share a synthesis pathway and are co-activated, they engage in distinct circuits and roles in modulating neural activity across the brain. However, in the computational neuroscience literature, they have been assigned similar roles in modulating the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Revealing how each neuromodulator contributes to this explore-exploit process is important in guiding mechanistic hypotheses emerging from computational psychiatric approaches. To understand the differences and overlaps of the roles of dopamine and norepinephrine in mediating exploration, a direct comparison using the same dynamic decision making task is needed. Here, we ran mice in a restless bandit task, which encourages both exploration and exploitation. We systemically administered a nonselective DA antagonist (flupenthixol), a nonselective DA agonist (apomorphine), a NE beta-receptor antagonist (propranolol), and a NE beta-receptor agonist (isoproterenol), and examined changes in exploration within subjects across sessions. We found a bidirectional modulatory effect of dopamine receptor activity on exploration - increasing dopamine activity decreased exploration and decreasing dopamine activity increased exploration. The modulation of exploration via beta-noradrenergic activity was mediated by sex. Computational model parameters revealed that dopamine modulation affected exploration via decision noise and norepinephrine modulation via outcome sensitivity. Together, these findings suggested that the mechanisms that govern the transition between exploration and exploitation are sensitive to changes in both catecholamine functions and revealed differential roles for NE and DA in mediating exploration.\n\nSignificance StatementBoth dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) has been implicated in the decision making process. Although these two catecholamines have shared aspects of their biosynthetic pathways and projection targets, they are thought to exert many core functions via distinct neural targets and receptor subtypes. However, the computational neuroscience literature often ascribes similar roles to these catecholamines, despite the above evidence. Resolving this discrepancy is important in guiding mechanistic hypotheses emerging from computational psychiatric approaches. This study examines the role of dopamine and norepinephrine on the explore-exploit tradeoff. By testing mice, we were able to compare multiple pharmacological agents within subjects, and examine source of individual differences, allowing direct comparison between the effects of these two catecholamines in modulating decision making.",

In this work, we present an automation strategy using a robotics platform for media changes of cartilaginous microtissues cultured in static microwell platforms. We use an automated image analysis pipeline to extract microtissue displacements and morphological features, which serve as input for statistical factor analysis. To minimize microtissue displacement and suspension leading to uncontrolled fusion, we performed a mixed factorial DoE on liquid handling parameters for large and small microwell platforms.\n\nAs a result, 144 images, with 51 471 spheroids could be processed automatically. The automated imaging workflow takes 2 minutes per image, and it can be implemented for on-line monitoring of microtissues, thus allowing informed decision making during manufacturing. We found that time in culture is the main factor for microtissue displacements, explaining 10 % of the displacements. Aspiration and dispension speed were not significant at manual speeds or beyond, with an effect size of 1 %. We defined optimal needle placement and depth for automated media changes and we suggest that robotic plate handling could improve the yield and homogeneity in size of microtissue cultures. After three weeks culture, increased expression of COL2A1 confirmed chondrogenic differentiation and RUNX2 shows no osteogenic specification. Histological analysis showed the secretion of cartilaginous extracellular matrix. Furthermore, microtissue-based implants were capable of forming mineralized tissues and bone after four weeks of ectopic implantation in nude mice.\n\nWe demonstrate the development of an integrated bioprocess for culturing and manipulation of cartilaginous microtissues.

To reveal the temporal sequence of transcription factor driven cellular changes we generated chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and gene expression (RNA-seq) data from in vitro differentiation of human B cells into plasma cells using a published protocol for differentiation up to the plasma cell stage. Using a new computational method, cisREAD (cis-Regulatory Elements Across Differentiation), we defined a core set of cis-regulatory elements that are confidently linked to dynamic transcription factor binding and changes in gene expression across the mature B lineage. Here we describe how cisREAD identifies regulatory element  communities, based on chromatin accessibility and transcription factor co-occupancy, and prioritizes those whose accessibility predicts differential gene expression through regularized regression models. Through downstream analyses of cisREAD-predicted regulation, we show how transcription factors reshape B cell epigenomes and transcriptomes in response to differentiation stimuli.

In this study, we reveal the molecular basis of how c-di-AMP binding inhibits KimA. We report cryo-EM structures of KimA with bound c-di-AMP in detergent solution and reconstituted in amphipols. By combining structural data with functional assays and molecular dynamics simulations we reveal how c-di-AMP modulates transport. We show that an intracellular loop in the transmembrane domain interacts with c-di-AMP bound to the adjacent cytosolic domain. This reduces the mobility of transmembrane helices at the cytosolic side of the K+ binding site and therefore traps KimA in an inward-occluded conformation.",

    "abstract": "Aims/hypothesisPancreatic beta cells secrete insulin to control glucose homeostasis. Beta cells can also adapt their function and mass when more insulin is required, especially in situations of insulin resistance (IR). Beta-cell mass adaptation can be achieved through either beta-cell proliferation or beta-cell neogenesis, a process that involves de novo beta-cell production from precursor cells. Signals and mechanisms that control adult beta-cell neogenesis and regulate the balance between beta-cell proliferation and/or beta-cell neogenesis still need to be fully deciphered. To do so, we previously developed a mouse model of pancreatic adaptation in response to a severe insulin resistance induced by a chronic glucocorticoid (GC) treatment. We observed a massive insulin production due to beta-cell adaptation by both proliferation and neogenesis. In the present study, we aimed at further characterizing beta-cell adaptation in response to mild or severe IR by studying various GC doses, along with other pharmacological or genetic models of IR. Further, we characterized the impact of aging on pancreatic adaptation in response to GC-induced IR. Finally, we precisely quantified adult beta-cell neogenesis by developing an original 3D method of beta-cell mass analysis in toto after organ clearing.\n\nMethodsGlucose metabolism, insulin secretion and pancreatic beta-cell adaptation were studied in mice rendered IR either by adipose tissue specific invalidation of SEIPIN, by chronic treatment with the insulin receptor antagonist S961 or by chronic treatment with several doses of GC both in young and aged mice. Moreover, we developed and used an unbiased-3D analysis of beta cells on whole cleared pancreas.\n\nResultsWe demonstrated that beta-cell neogenesis - reflected by an increase in islet density - is constantly observed in response to genetically- or pharmacology-induced (S961 or GC) IR. Next, we observed that pancreatic adaptation mechanisms are closely defined by the level of IR. Indeed, mild IR induced by low dose of GC resulted in functional adaptation solely, while more severe IR induced by higher doses of GC resulted in an increase in both islet density and mean islet size, reflecting beta-cell neogenesis and proliferation, respectively. Then, we showed that in older mice, beta-cell adaptation through neogenesis is preserved in response to IR. Finally, using a new and unbiased 3D analysis, we confirmed the increase in islet density and mean islet size after GCs treatment.\n\nConclusions/interpretationOur results present evidence that beta-cell neogenesis is a preferential mechanism of pancreatic adaptation to increase insulin secretion in response to IR in mice. Moreover, aging does not preclude beta-cell neogenesis, suggesting that it could be triggered in elderly to compensate for IR. Finally, our innovative technique of 3D analysis of whole pancreas confirms the existence of adult beta-cell neogenesis and offers a new avenue to study islet cells and pancreas adaptation.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this subject?C_ST_ABSO_LIInsulin resistance can be compensated by improved insulin secretion and increased beta-cell mass.\nC_LIO_LINew beta cells can be formed in the pancreas of adult mice through the differentiation of precursors, a process known as neogenesis.\nC_LIO_LIWe previously demonstrated that glucocorticoid (GC) -induced insulin resistance leads to enhanced beta-cell proliferation and neogenesis.\nC_LI\n\nWhat is the key question?O_LIIs adaptive beta-cell neogenesis specific to GC-induced insulin resistance and persists in old mice ?\nC_LI\n\nWhat are the new findings?O_LIInsulin resistance, either genetically- or drug-induced, is a key driver to induce adaptive beta-cell neogenesis in the mouse pancreas.\nC_LIO_LIAging does not prevent the induction of beta-cell neogenesis in response to insulin resistance.\nC_LIO_LIThree-dimension analysis on cleared pancreas confirms beta-cell neogenesis in mouse models of GC-induced insulin resistance.\nC_LI\n\nHow might this impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?O_LIThe mouse model of adaptive beta-cell neogenesis will be helpful to define new therapeutic targets to induce the formation of new beta cells and treat diabetes.\nC_LI",

However, the lack of access to hands-on demonstrations has led to inequalities of opportunity and practice.

To address these challenges, we develop four shelf-stable cell-free biosensing educational modules that work by just-adding-water and DNA to freeze-dried crude extracts of Escherichia coli. We introduce activities and supporting curricula to teach the structure and function of the lac operon, dose-responsive behavior, considerations for biosensor outputs, and a  build-your-own activity for monitoring environmental contaminants in water. We piloted these modules with K-12 teachers and 130 high school students in their classrooms - and at home - without professional laboratory equipment or researcher oversight.

    "abstract": "Reactively canceling movements is a vital feature of the motor system to ensure safety. This behavior can be studied in the laboratory using the stop signal task. There remains ambiguity about whether a \"point-of-no-return\" exists, after which a response cannot be aborted. A separate question concerns whether motor system inhibition associated with attempted stopping persists when stopping is unsuccessful. We address these two questions using electromyography (EMG) in two stop signal task experiments. Experiment 1 (n = 24) involved simple right and left index finger responses in separate task blocks. Experiment 2 (n = 28) involved a response choice between the right index and pinky fingers. To evaluate the approximate point-of-no-return, we measured EMG in responding fingers during the 100 ms preceding the stop signal and observed significantly greater EMG amplitudes during failed than successful stop trials in both experiments. Thus, EMG differentiated failed from successful stopping prior to the stop signal, regardless of whether there was a response choice. To address whether motor inhibition persists after failed stopping, we assessed EMG peak-to-offset durations and slopes (i.e., the rate of EMG decline) for go, failed stop, and successful stop (partial response EMG) trials. EMG peak-to-offset was shorter and steeper in failed stop trials compared to go and successful stop partial response EMG trials, suggesting motor inhibition persists even when failing to stop. These findings indicate EMG is sensitive to a point at which participants can no longer successfully stop an ongoing movement and suggest the peak-to-offset time of response-related EMG activity during failed stopping reflects stopping-related inhibition.",

    "abstract": "The task of directional hearing faces most of the animals that possess ears. They approach this task in different ways, but the common trait is the usage of the binaural cues to find the direction to the source of sound. In insects, the task is further complicated by their small size and, hence, minute temporal and level differences between two ears. A way to overcome this problem is to receive the particle velocity component of sound rather than the pressure, as the former naturally involves directionality. However, even in this case, one ear is not enough for directional hearing: a single symmetric flagellar particle velocity receiver cannot discriminate between the two opposite directions along the vector of the sound wave. Insects that use flagellar auditory organs, and mosquitoes in particular, possess a pair of receivers, which presumes the usage of binaural hearing. Its mechanisms are expected to be significantly different from the ones typical for the pressure receivers. However, the directionality of flagellar auditory organs has received little attention. Here we measured the in-flight orientation of a female mosquito antennae and obtained detailed physiological mapping of the Johnstons organ directionality at the level of individual sensory units. By combining these data, we provided a three-dimensional model of the mosquitos auditory space. The natural orientation of the antennae together with angular distribution of sensory units in each of the Johnstons organs was found to be optimal for binaural hearing focused primarily in front of, above and below a flying mosquito.",

    "abstract": "Although the pathophysiology of pain has been investigated tremendously, there are still many open questions, especially with regard to specific pain entities and their pain-related symptoms. To increase the translational impact of (preclinical) animal pain neuroimaging studies, the use of disease-specific pain models, as well as relevant stimulus modalities, are critical. Yet, the challenges of identifying neuroimaging signatures at a pain entity- and modality-specific level are manifold. Therefore, we developed a comprehensive framework for brain network analysis in disease-specific pain models combining functional MRI with graph-theory and data classification by linear discriminant analysis. This enabled us to expand our knowledge of stimulus (mechanical vs. electrical) modality processing under incisional (INC) and pathogen-induced inflammatory (CFA) pain entities compared to acute pain conditions. In short, graph-theoretical analyses revealed distinct Network Signatures of Pain Hypersensitivity (NSPH) for INC and CFA, resulting in impaired discrimination of stimulus modalities in both pain models compared to control conditions (CTR). Such specific neuroimaging signatures are an important step toward identifying novel pain biomarkers for certain diseases and relevant outcomes to evaluate target engagement of novel therapeutic options, which ultimately can be translated to the clinic.",

    "abstract": "There is renewed interest in electrical activity that extends beyond the typical electrophysiological 100 Hz bandwidth. This activity, often in the anterior temporal lobe, has been attributed to processes ranging from memory consolidation to epileptiform activity. Here, using an open-access resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset (n = 89), and a second task-based MEG dataset, we could reliably localise high-frequency power to the temporal lobes across multiple bands up to 300-400 Hz. A functional connectivity analysis of this activity revealed a robust resting state bilateral network between the temporal lobes. However, we also found robust coherence in the 100-200 and 200-300 Hz bands between source reconstructed MEG data and the electrooculography (EOG) localised to within the temporal poles. Additional denoising schemes applied to the data could reduce power localisation to the temporal poles but the topography of the functional network did not drastically alter. Whilst it is clear that this network is biological and robust to established denoising methods, we cannot definitively rule yet on whether this is of neural or myogenic origin.",

    "abstract": "Although higher-order cognitive and lower-order sensorimotor abilities are generally regarded as distinct and studied separately, there is evidence that they not only covary but also that this covariation increases across the lifespan. This pattern has been leveraged in clinical settings where a simple assessment of sensory or motor ability (e.g., hearing, gait speed) can forecast age-related cognitive decline and risk for dementia. However, the brain mechanisms underlying cognitive, sensory, and motor covariation are largely unknown. Here, we examined whether such covariation in midlife reflects variability in common versus distinct neocortical networks using individualized maps of functional topography derived from BOLD fMRI data collected in 769 45-year old members of a population-representative cohort. Analyses revealed that variability in basic motor but not hearing ability reflected individual differences in the functional topography of neocortical networks typically supporting cognitive ability. These patterns suggest that covariation in motor and cognitive abilities in midlife reflects convergence of function in higher-order neocortical networks and that gait speed may not be simply a measure of physical function but rather an integrative index of nervous system health.",

    "abstract": "Human neuroimaging studies have shown that the contents of episodic memories are represented in distributed patterns of neural activity. However, these studies have mostly been limited to decoding simple, unidimensional properties of stimuli. Semantic encoding models, in contrast, offer a means for characterizing the rich, multidimensional information that comprises episodic memories. Here, we extensively sampled four human fMRI subjects to build semantic encoding models and then applied these models to reconstruct content from natural scene images as they were viewed and recalled from memory. First, we found that multidimensional semantic information was successfully reconstructed from activity patterns across visual and lateral parietal cortices, both when viewing scenes and when recalling them from memory. Second, whereas visual cortical reconstructions were much more accurate when images were viewed versus recalled from memory, lateral parietal reconstructions were comparably accurate across visual perception and memory. Third, by applying natural language processing methods to verbal recall data, we showed that fMRI-based reconstructions reliably matched subjects verbal descriptions of their memories. In fact, reconstructions from ventral temporal cortex more closely matched subjects own verbal recall than other subjects verbal recall of the same images. Fourth, encoding models reliably transferred across subjects: memories were successfully reconstructed using encoding models trained on data from entirely independent subjects. Together, these findings provide evidence for successful reconstructions of multidimensional and idiosyncratic memory representations and highlight the differential sensitivity of visual cortical and lateral parietal regions to information derived from the external visual environment versus internally-generated memories.",

    "abstract": "While mitochondria in different tissues have distinct preferences for energy sources, they are flexible in utilizing competing substrates for metabolism according to physiological and nutritional circumstances. However, the regulatory mechanisms and significance of metabolic flexibility are not completely understood. Here we report that the deletion of PTPMT1, a mitochondria-based phosphatase, critically alters mitochondrial fuel selection - the utilization of pyruvate, a key mitochondrial substrate derived from glucose (the major simple carbohydrate), is inhibited, whereas the fatty acid utilization is enhanced. PTPMT1 knockout does not impact the development of the skeletal muscle or heart. However, the metabolic inflexibility ultimately leads to muscular atrophy, heart failure, and sudden death. Mechanistic analyses reveal that the prolonged substrate shift from carbohydrates to lipids causes oxidative stress and mitochondrial destruction, which in turn results in marked accumulation of lipids and profound damage in the knockout muscle cells and cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, PTPMT1 deletion from the liver or adipose tissue does not generate any local or systemic defects. These findings suggest that PTPMT1 plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial flexibility and that their balanced utilization of carbohydrates and lipids is essential for both the skeletal muscle and the heart despite the two tissues having different preferred energy sources.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are abundant in sepsis, and proposed NET-directed therapies in sepsis prevent their formation or accelerate degradation. Yet NETs are important for microbial entrapment, as NET digestion liberates pathogens and NET degradation products (NDPs) that deleteriously promote thrombosis and endothelial cell injury. We proposed an alternative strategy of NET-stabilization with the chemokine, platelet factor 4 (PF4, CXCL4), which we have shown enhances NET-mediated microbial entrapment. We now show that NET compaction by PF4 reduces their thrombogenicity. In vitro, we quantified plasma thrombin and fibrin generation by intact or degraded NETs and cell-free (cf) DNA fragments, and found that digested NETs and short DNA fragments were more thrombogenic than intact NETs and high molecular weight genomic DNA, respectively. PF4 reduced the thrombogenicity of digested NETs and DNA by interfering, in part, with contact pathway activation. In endothelial cell culture studies, short DNA fragments promoted von Willebrand factor release and tissue factor expression via a toll-like receptor 9-dependent mechanism. PF4 blocked these effects. Cxcl4-/- mice infused with cfDNA exhibited higher plasma thrombin anti-thrombin (TAT) levels compared to wild-type controls. Following challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, Cxcl4-/- mice had similar elevations in plasma TAT and cfDNA, effects prevented by PF4 infusion. Thus, NET-stabilization by PF4 prevents the release of short fragments of cfDNA, limiting the activation of the contact coagulation pathway and reducing endothelial injury. These results support our hypothesis that NET-stabilization reduces pathologic sequelae in sepsis, an observation of potential clinical benefit.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIIn contrast to intact NETs, degraded NETs and cfDNA are prothrombotic and injure the endothelium.\nC_LIO_LIPF4 reduces the ability of degraded NETs and cfDNA to promote thrombosis and injure the endothelium.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Quantitative characterizations of cellular dynamics and features of individual cells from a large heterogenous population is essential to identify rare, disease-driving cells, which often exhibit aberrant cellular behaviors like abnormal division, aggressive migration or irregular phylogenetic cell lineages. A recent development in the combination of high-throughput screening microscopy with single cell profiling provides an unprecedented opportunity to decipher the underlying mechanisms of disease-driving phenotypes observed under a microscope. However, accurately and instantly processing large amounts of image data like longitudinal time lapse movies remains a technical challenge when an immediate analysis output (in minutes) of quantitative characterizations is required after data acquisition. Here we present a Fast and Accurate real-time Cell Tracking (FACT) algorithm, which combines GPU-based, ground truth-assisted trainable Weka segmentation and real-time Gaussian mixture model-based cell linking. FACT also implements an automatic cell track correction function to improve the tracking accuracy. With FACT, we can segment [~]20,000 cells in 2 seconds ([~]4.5-27.5 times faster than state-of-the-art), and can export quantifiable features from the cell tracking results minutes after data acquisition (independent of the number of acquired image frames) with average 90-95% tracking precision. Such performance is not feasible with state-of-the-art cell tracking algorithms. We applied FACT to real-time identify directionally migrating glioblastoma cells with 96% precision and to identify rare, irregular cell lineages in a population of [~]10,000 cells from a 24hr-time lapse movie with an average 91% F1 score, results from both were exported instantly, mere minutes after image acquisition.",

    "abstract": "The potential to carry out high-throughput assays in a whole organism in a small space is one of the benefits of C. elegans, but worm assays often require a large sample size with frequent physical manipulations, rendering them highly labor-intensive. Microfluidic assays have been designed with specific questions in mind, such as analysis of behavior, embryonic development, lifespan, and motility. While these devices have many advantages, current technologies to automate worm experiments have several limitations that prevent widespread adoption, and most do not allow analyses of reproduction-linked traits. We developed a miniature C. elegans lab-on-a-chip device, CeLab, a reusable, multi-layer device with 200 separate incubation arenas that allows progeny removal, to automate a variety of worm assays on both individual and population levels. CeLab enables high-throughput simultaneous analysis of lifespan, reproductive span, and progeny production, refuting assumptions about the Disposable Soma hypothesis. Because CeLab chambers require small volumes, the chip is ideal for drug screens; we found that drugs previously shown to increase lifespan also increase reproductive span, and we discovered that low-dose metformin increases both. CeLab reduces the limitations of escaping and matricide that typically limit plate assays, revealing that feeding with heat-killed bacteria greatly extends lifespan and reproductive span of mated animals. CeLab allows tracking of life history traits of individuals, which revealed that the nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway mutant, sgk-1, reproduces nearly until its death. These findings would not have been possible to make in standard plate assays, in low-throughput assays, or in normal population assays.",

    "abstract": "Cre/LoxP technology has revolutionized genetic studies and allowed for spatial and temporal control of gene expression in specific cell types. The field of microglial biology has particularly benefited from this technology as microglia have historically been difficult to transduce with virus or electroporation methods for gene delivery. Here, we interrogate four of the most widely available microglial inducible Cre lines. We demonstrate varying degrees of recombination efficiency and spontaneous recombination, depending on the Cre line and loxP distance. We also establish best practice guidelines and protocols to measure recombination efficiency in microglia, which could be extended to other cell types. There is increasing evidence that microglia are key regulators of neural circuit structure and function. Microglia are also major drivers of a broad range of neurological diseases. Thus, reliable manipulation of their function in vivo is of utmost importance. Identifying caveats and benefits of all tools and implementing the most rigorous protocols are crucial to the growth of the field of microglial biology and the development of microglia-based therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau (MAPT) is one of the proteins that are central to neurodegenerative diseases. The nature of intracellular tau aggregates is determined by the cell types whether neuronal or glial, the participating tau isoforms, and the structure of the amyloid filament. The transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) has recently emerged as another significant player in neurodegeneration and aging. In the central nervous system, the composition of the gray and white matter differs considerably. The gray matter consists of nerve cell bodies, dendrites, unmyelinated axons, synaptic terminals, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes (satellite cells) and microglia. The white matter differs from the gray for the presence of axonal tracts as the only neuronal component and for the absence of nerve cell bodies, dendrites and synaptic terminals. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies have unveiled the structure of tau and TMEM106B, from the cerebral cortex, in several neurodegenerative diseases; however, whether tau and TMEM106B filaments from the gray and white matter share a common fold requires additional investigation.\n\nMethodsWe isolated tau and TMEM106B from the cerebral cortex and white matter of the frontal lobes of two individuals affected by multiple system tauopathy with presenile dementia (MSTD), a disease caused by the MAPT intron 10 mutation +3. We used immunostaining, biochemical, genetics and cryo-EM methods to characterize tau and TMEM106B.\n\nResultsWe determined that tau filaments in the gray and the white matter of MSTD individuals can induce tau aggregation and have identical AGD type 2 folds. TMEM106B amyloid filaments were also found in the gray and white matter of MSTD; the filament folds were identical in the two anatomical regions.\n\nConclusionsOur findings show for the first time that in MSTD two types of amyloid filaments extracted from the gray matter have identical folds to those extracted from the white matter. Whether in this genetic disorder there is a relationship in the pathogenesis of the tau and TMEM106B filaments, remains to be determined. Furthermore, additional studies are needed for other proteins and other neurodegenerative diseases to establish whether filaments extracted from the gray and white matter would have identical folds.",

    "abstract": "Glutamatergic projection neurons of the lateral habenula (LHb) drive behavioral state modulation by regulating the activity of midbrain monoaminergic neurons. Identifying circuit mechanisms that modulate LHb output is of interest for understanding control of motivated behaviors. A small population of neurons within the medial subnucleus of the mouse LHb express the GABAergic synthesizing enzyme GAD2, and they can inhibit nearby LHb projection neurons; however, these neurons lack markers of classic inhibitory interneurons and they co-express the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2. To determine the molecular phenotype of these neurons, we genetically tagged the nuclei of GAD2-positive cells and used fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting to isolate and enrich these nuclei for single nuclear RNA sequencing (FANS-snRNAseq). Our data confirm that GAD2+/VGLUT2+ neurons intrinsic to the LHb co-express markers of both glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission and that they are transcriptionally distinct from either GABAergic interneurons or habenular glutamatergic neurons. We identify gene expression programs within these cells that show sex-specific differences in expression and that are implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD), which has been linked to LHb hyperactivity. Finally, we identify the Ntng2 gene encoding the cell adhesion protein Netrin-G2 as a marker of LHb GAD2+/VGLUT+ neurons and a gene product that may contribute to their target projections. These data show the value of using genetic enrichment of rare cell types for transcriptome studies, and they advance understanding of the molecular composition of a functionally important class of GAD2+ neurons in the LHb.",

    "abstract": "Focal Cortical Dysplasias (FCDs) are a common subtype of malformation of cortical development, which frequently present with a spectrum of cognitive and behavioural abnormalities as well as pharmacoresistant epilepsy. FCD type II is typically caused by somatic mutations resulting in mTOR hyperactivity, and is the commonest pathology found in children undergoing epilepsy surgery. However, surgical resection does not always result in seizure freedom, and is often precluded by proximity to eloquent brain regions. Gene therapy is a promising potential alternative treatment and may be appropriate in cases that represent an unacceptable surgical risk. Here, we evaluated a gene therapy based on overexpression of the Kv1.1 potassium channel in a mouse model of frontal lobe FCD. An engineered potassium channel (EKC) transgene was placed under control of a human promoter that biases expression towards principal neurons (CAMK2A) and packaged in an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV9). We used an established FCD model generated by in utero electroporation of frontal lobe neural progenitors with a constitutively active human RHEB plasmid, an activator of mTOR Complex 1. First, we further characterised this by quantifying electrocorticograms and behavioural abnormalities, both in mice developing spontaneous generalised seizures and in mice only exhibiting abnormal interictal discharges. Then, using continuous video-electrocorticogram recordings from epileptic mice before and after injection of AAV9-CAMK2A-EKC in the dysplastic region, we observed a robust decrease in the frequency of seizures and in interictal activity, compared to mice injected with a control viral vector. Despite the robust anti-epileptic effect of the treatment, there was neither an improvement nor a worsening of performance in behavioural tests sensitive to frontal lobe function. AAV9-CAMK2A-EKC had no effect on interictal activity or behaviour in non-epileptic mice. AAV9-CAMK2A-EKC gene therapy is a promising therapy with translational potential to treat the epileptic phenotype of mTOR-related malformations of cortical development. Cognitive and behavioural co-morbidities may, however, resist an intervention aimed at reducing circuit excitability.",

    "abstract": "For survival of the organism T cells must efficiently control pathogens invading different peripheral tissues but whether such control (and lack of thereof) is achieved by utilizing different movement strategies remains poorly understood. Liver-localized CD8 T cells perform correlated random walks -- a type of a Brownian walk - in liver sinusoids but in some condition these T cells may also perform Levy flights - rapid and large displacements by floating with the blood flow. CD8 T cells in lymph nodes or skin also undergo Brownian walks. A recent study suggested that brain-localized CD8 T cells, specific to Toxoplasma gondii, perform generalized Levy walks - a walk type in which T cells alternate pausing and displacing long distances -- which may indicate that brain is a unique organ where T cells exhibit movement strategies different from other tissues. We quantified movement patterns of brain-localized Plasmodium berghei-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells by using well-established statistical and computational methods. Interestingly, we found that T cells change their movement pattern with time since infection and that CD4 T cells move faster and turn less than CD8 T cells. Importantly, both CD4 and CD8 T cells move in the brain by correlated random walks without long displacements challenging previous observations. We have also re-analyzed the movement data of brain-localized CD8 T cells in T. gondii -infected mice and found no evidence of Levy walks. We hypothesize that the previous conclusion of Levy walks of T. gondii-specific CD8 T cells in the brain was reached due to missing time-frames in the data that create an impression of large displacements between assumed-to-be-sequential movements. Taken together, our results suggests that movement strategies of CD8 T cells are largely similar between LNs, liver, and the brain and consistent with correlated random walks and not Levy walks.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) comprises a large group of neurodevelopmental conditions featuring, over a wide range of severity and combinations, a core set of manifestations (restricted sociality, stereotyped behavior and language impairment) alongside various comorbidities. Common and rare variants in several hundreds of genes and regulatory regions have been implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of ASD along a range of causation evidence strength. Despite significant progress in elucidating the impact of few paradigmatic individual loci, such sheer complexity in the genetic architecture underlying ASD as a whole has hampered the identification of convergent actionable hubs hypothesized to relay between the vastness of risk alleles and the core phenotypes. In turn this has limited the development of strategies that can revert or ameliorate this condition, calling for a systems-level approach to probe the cross-talk of cooperating genes in terms of causal interaction networks in order to make convergences experimentally tractable and reveal their clinical actionability. As a first step in this direction, we have captured from the scientific literature information on the causal links between the genes whose variants have been associated with ASD and the whole human proteome. This information has been annotated in a computer readable format in the SIGNOR database and is made freely available in the resource website. To link this information to cell functions and phenotypes, we have developed graph algorithms that estimate the functional distance of any protein in the SIGNOR causal interactome to phenotypes and pathways. The main novelty of our approach resides in the possibility to explore the mechanistic links connecting the suggested gene-phenotype relations.",

    "abstract": "Phosphoinositide metabolism defines the foundation of a major signaling pathway that is conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom. The 4-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate are particularly important molecules as these execute intrinsically essential activities required for the viability of all eukaryotic cells studied thus far. Using intracellular tachyzoites of the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii as model for assessing primordial roles for PtdIns4P signaling, we demonstrate the presence of PtdIns4P pools in Golgi/trans-Golgi (TGN) system and in post-TGN compartments of the parasite. Moreover, we show that deficits in PtdIns4P signaling result in structural perturbation of compartments that house dense granule cargo with accompanying deficits in dense granule exocytosis. Taken together, the data report a direct role for PtdIns4P in dense granule biogenesis and exocytosis. The data further indicate that the biogenic pathway for secretion-competent dense granule formation in T. gondii is more complex than simple budding of fully matured dense granules from the TGN.",
