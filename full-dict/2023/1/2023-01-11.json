    "abstract": "Pooled variant expression libraries can test the phenotypes of thousands of variants of a gene in a single multiplexed experiment. In a library encoding all single-amino-acid substitutions of a protein, each variant differs from its reference only at a single codon-position located anywhere along the coding sequence. Consequently, accurately identifying these variants by sequencing is a major technical challenge. A popular but expensive brute-force approach is to divide the pool of variants into multiple smaller sub-libraries that each contains variants of a small region and that must each be constructed and screened individually, but that can then be PCR-amplified and fully sequenced with a single read to allow direct readout of variant abundance. Here we present an approach to screen very large variant libraries with mutations spanning a wide region in a single pool, including library design criteria and mutant-detection algorithms that permit reliable calling and counting of variants from large-scale sequencing data.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHevea brasiliensis, a tree species from the Amazon rainforest, is the main global natural rubber source. Due to high pressure from fungal diseases in hot, humid regions, rubber plantations have been moved to dryer \"scape areas\" with lower temperatures. We studied GT1 and RRIM 600 rubber tree clones with different cold tolerance strategies to analyze gene expression regulation during 24 hours of cold exposure.\n\nResultsThe RNA-seq gene co-expression network (GCN) was developed with 27,220 genes grouped into 205 gene clusters. Through the GCN, we related predominant rubber tree molecular responses to cold stress to 31 clusters, divided into three GCN modules: a downregulated group with 16 clusters and two upregulated groups with twelve and three clusters. Hub genes of cold-responsive modules were also identified and analyzed. Considering the three modules and hub genes identified, we concluded that the general Hevea response to short-term cold exposure involves complex jasmonic acid stress response and programmed cell death regulation, ethylene-responsive gene upregulation and relaxation of florigen gene inhibition. The GCN strategy not only identified single DEGs related to Hevea cold responses but also provided insights into a more extensive cascade of associated mechanisms involved in the young rubber tree cold stress response.\n\nConclusionsOur findings may represent the genetic stress responses developed during species evolution. Understanding H. brasiliensis cold response mechanisms could improve breeding strategies for this crop with a narrow genetic base being impacted by climate change that is the only large-scale rubber production source.\n\nKey MessageDifferent cold tolerance strategies were revealed through gene expression analysis during cold exposure in rubber tree. This approach identified genes and provided insights into molecular pathways involved in such resistance.",

    "abstract": "In the early stages of Alzheimers disease (AD), the accumulation of the peptide amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) damages synapses and disrupts neuronal activity and leads to disruption of neuronal oscillations associated with cognition. This is thought to be largely due to impairments in CNS synaptic inhibition, particularly via parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons that essential for generating several key oscillations. Research in this field has largely been conducted in mouse models that over-express humanised, mutated forms of AD-associated genes that produce exaggerated pathology. This has prompted the development and use of knock-in mouse lines that express these genes at an endogenous level, such as the AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mouse model used in the present study. These mice appear to model the early stages of A{beta}-induced network impairments, yet an in-depth characterisation of these impairments in currently lacking. Therefore, using 16 month-old AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice, we analysed neuronal oscillations found in the hippocampal - medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during awake behaviour, rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep to assess the extent of network dysfunction. No alterations to gamma oscillations were found to occur in the hippocampus or mPFC during either awake behaviour, REM or NREM sleep. However, during NREM sleep an increase in the amplitude of mPFC spindles and decrease in the power of hippocampal SWRs was identified. The former was associated with a decrease in the density of mPFC PV-expressing interneurons and the latter was accompanied by an increase in the synchronisation of PV-expressing interneuron activity, as measured using two-photon Ca2+ imaging. Furthermore, although changes were detected in local network function of mPFC and hippocampus, long-range communication between these regions appeared intact. Altogether, our results suggest that these NREM sleep-specific impairments represent the early stages of circuit breakdown in response to amyloidopathy.",

    "abstract": "In many species, individuals who experience harsh conditions during development often have poor health and fitness outcomes in adulthood relative to peers who do not. There are two classes of evolutionary hypotheses for the origins of these early life contributors to inequality in adulthood: developmental constraints (DC) models, which focus on the deleterious effects of low-quality early-life environments, and predictive adaptive response (PAR) hypotheses, which emphasize the cost of mismatches between early and adult environments. Distinguishing DC and PAR models empirically is difficult for both conceptual and analytical reasons. Here, we resolve this difficulty by providing explicit mathematical definitions for DC, PARs, and related concepts, and propose a novel, quadratic regression-based statistical test derived from these definitions. Simulations show that this approach improves the ability to discriminate between DC and PAR hypotheses relative to a common alternative based on testing for interaction effects between developmental and adult environments. Simulated data indicate that the interaction effects approach often conflates PARs with DC, while the quadratic regression approach yields high sensitivity and specificity for detecting PARs. Our results highlight the value of linking verbal and visual models to a formal mathematical treatment for understanding the developmental origins of inequitable adult outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The adolescent social experience is essential for the maturation of the prefrontal cortex in mammalian species. However, it still needs to be determined which cortical circuits mature with such experience and how it shapes adult social behaviors in a sex-specific manner. Here, we examined social approaching behaviors in male and female mice after post-weaning social isolation (PWSI), which deprives social experience during adolescence. We found that the PWSI, particularly isolation during late adolescence, caused an abnormal increase in social approaches (hypersociability) only in female mice. We further found that the PWSI female mice showed reduced parvalbumin (PV) expression in the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFCL). When we measured neural activity in the female OFCL, a substantial number of neurons showed higher activity when mice sniffed other mice (social sniffing) than when they sniffed an object (object sniffing). Interestingly, the PWSI significantly reduced both the number of activated neurons and the activity level during social sniffing in female mice. Similarly, the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-down of PV in the OFCL during late adolescence enhanced sociability and reduced the social sniffing-induced activity in adult female mice via decreased excitability of PV+ neurons and reduced synaptic inhibition in the OFCL. Moreover, optogenetic activation of excitatory neurons or optogenetic inhibition of PV+ neurons in the OFCL enhanced sociability in female mice. Our data demonstrate that the adolescent social experience is critical for the maturation of PV+ inhibitory circuits in the OFCL; this maturation shapes female social behavior via enhancing social representation in the OFCL.\n\nSignificance StatementAdolescent social isolation often changes adult social behaviors in mammals. Yet, we do not fully understand the sex-specific effects of social isolation and the brain areas and circuits that mediate such changes. Here, we found that adolescent social isolation causes three abnormal phenotypes in female but not male mice: hypersociability, decreased PV+ neurons in the OFCL, and decreased socially evoked activity in the OFCL. Moreover, PV deletion in the OFCL in vivo caused the same phenotypes in female mice by increasing excitation compared with inhibition within the OFCL. Our data suggest that adolescent social experience is required for PV maturation in the OFCL, which is critical for evoking OFCL activity that shapes social behaviors in female mice.",

    "abstract": "When divergent populations interbreed, the outcome will be affected by the genomic and phenotypic differences that they have accumulated. In this way, the mode of evolutionary divergence between populations may have predictable consequences for the fitness of their hybrids, and so for the progress of speciation. To investigate these connections, we present a new analysis of hybridization under Fishers geometric model, making few assumptions about the allelic effects that differentiate the hybridizing populations. Results show that the strength and form of postzygotic reproductive isolation (RI) depend on just two properties of the evolutionary changes, which we call the \"total amount\" and \"net effect\" of change, and whose difference quantifies the similarity of the changes at different loci, or their tendency to act in the same phenotypic direction. It follows from our results that identical patterns of RI can arise in different ways, since different evolutionary histories can lead to the same total amount and net effect of change. Nevertheless, we show how these estimable quantities do contain some information about the history of divergence, and that - thanks to Haldanes Sieve - the dominance and additive effects contain complementary information.\n\nImpact SummaryWhen populations of animals or plants evolve differences in their genomes or traits, the nature of the differences will help to determine whether they can continue to interbreed. For example, the hybrid offspring may be infertile, or unlikely to survive to reproductive age, meaning that the two populations remain distinct from one another even after mating. However, in some cases the hybrids may be more fertile than their parents or have some other reproductive advantage. In this study, we use a mathematical model to relate hybrid fitness to the evolved differences separating the parents. We find that the outcome depends on just two properties of these differences, which capture the \"total amount\" and the \"net effect\" of evolutionary change. We then show that different evolutionary divergence scenarios or modes can lead to the exact same hybrid fitness. On the other hand, we can still make some inferences about the history of divergence by observing certain properties of hybrid fitness. Determining the relationship between hybrid fitness and the mode of evolutionary divergence will help to understand how new species form, to plan conservation interventions such as moving individuals between isolated populations to increase their adaptive potential, and to understand how existing species might interact when their habitats overlap, for example due to climate change or other human impacts.",

We identified that NAK Associated Protein 1 (NAP1) is essential for mitosis which binds to TBK1 on the centrosomes to activate it. Loss of NAP1 causes several mitotic and cytokinetic defects due to inactivation of TBK1. Our quantitative phosphoproteomics identified numerous TBK1 substrates that are not only confined to the centrosomes but also are associated with microtubules. Substrate motifs analysis indicates that TBK1 acts upstream of other essential cell cycle kinases like Aurora and PAK kinases. We also identified NAP1 as a TBK1 substrate at S318 promoting its degradation by ubiquitin proteasomal system acting as a negative regulatory step. These data uncover an important distinct function for the NAP1-TBK1 complex during cell division.",

Here we present a system that enables acute manipulation and real-time visualization of membrane trafficking through reversible retention of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in living multicellular organisms. By adapting the \"retention using selective hooks\" (RUSH) approach to Drosophila, we show that trafficking of GPI-linked, secreted, and transmembrane proteins can be controlled with high temporal precision in intact animals and cultured organs. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by analyzing the kinetics of ER exit and apical secretion and the spatiotemporal dynamics of tricellular junction assembly in epithelia of living embryos. Furthermore, we show that controllable ER-retention enables tissue-specific depletion of secretory protein function. The system is broadly applicable to visualize and manipulate membrane trafficking in diverse cell types in vivo.",

The proposed method outperformed certain conventional methods, including those that assume beta-binomial distribution for methylation as the proposed method does not require this, especially when applied to methylation profiles measured using high throughput sequencing. DMCs identified by the proposed method also significantly overlapped with various functional sites, including known differentially methylated regions, enhancers, and DNase I hypersensitive sites. The proposed method was applied to data sets retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify DMCs using American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system edition labels.

This polar auxin transport predominantly relies on PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin exporters. Hence, PIN polarization is crucial for development, but its evolution during the rise of morphological complexity in land plants remains unclear. Here, we performed a cross-species investigation by observing the trafficking and localization of endogenous and xenologous PINs in two bryophytes, Physcomitrium patens and Marchantia polymorpha, and in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We confirmed that the GFP fusion did not compromise the auxin export function of all examined PINs by using radioactive auxin export assay and by observing the phenotypic changes in transgenic bryophytes. Endogenous PINs polarize to filamentous apices, while xenologous Arabidopsis PINs distribute symmetrically on the membrane in both bryophytes. In Arabidopsis root epidermis, bryophytic PINs show no defined polarity. Pharmacological interference revealed a strong cytoskeleton dependence of bryophytic but not Arabidopsis PIN polarization. The divergence of PIN polarization and trafficking is also observed within the bryophyte clade and between tissues in individual species. These results collectively reveal a divergence of PIN trafficking and polarity mechanisms throughout land plant evolution and a co-evolution of PIN sequence-based and cell-based polarity mechanisms.",

An understanding of intrinsic disorder is key to develop compounds that target IDPs. Experimental characterization of IDPs is hindered by the very fact that they are highly dynamic. Computational methods that predict disorder from the amino acid sequence have been proposed. Here, we present ADOPT, a new predictor of protein disorder. ADOPT is composed of a self-supervised encoder and a supervised disorder predictor. The former is based on a deep bidirectional transformer, which extracts dense residue level representations from Facebooks Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM) library. The latter uses a database of NMR chemical shifts, constructed to ensure balanced amounts of disordered and ordered residues, as a training and test dataset for protein disorder. ADOPT predicts whether a protein or a specific region is disordered with better performance than the best existing predictors and faster than most other proposed methods (a few seconds per sequence). We identify the features which are relevant for the prediction performance and show that good performance can already gained with less than 100 features.

This study has elucidated the antiviral mechanisms of natural small molecules against the dengue (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Herbacetin (HC) and Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) depleted polyamine levels in Vero cells, which has been demonstrated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). As polyamines play an essential role in the replication and transcription of RNA viruses, the depletion of polyamines by HC and CAPE was anticipated to inhibit the virus replication. To test this hypothesis, HC and CAPE were evaluated for antiviral activities using a cell-based virus yield assay by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), plaque reduction assay, and immunofluorescence assay (IFA). HC and CAPE displayed potent inhibition with EC50 of 463 nM and 0.417 nM for CHIKV and 8.5 {micro}M and 1.15 {micro}M for DENV, respectively. However, the addition of exogenous polyamines did not ultimately rescue the virus titer in both CHIKV and DENV-infected cells. This finding suggested additional antiviral mechanisms for HC and CAPE. Further, in silico analysis revealed that HC and CAPE may directly target the viral methyltransferases (MTase) of CHIKV and DENV. The inhibition of virus-specific MTases by HC and CAPE was confirmed using purified viral MTase of CHIKV and DENV. Altogether, the dual targeting of the host pathway and the viral MTase using potent natural antiviral molecules is expected to facilitate the development of effective biological therapies.\n\nIMPORTANCEVector-borne diseases caused by DENV and CHIKV has a catastrophic impact on human health worldwide. There are no effective vaccines and antiviral drugs present in the market till date against these viruses. In the present study, natural small molecules have been identified as antivirals against DENV and CHIKV. These molecules directly inhibit the virus and impede the synthesis of essential host molecules required for efficient virus replication. Hence, these broad-spectrum antivirals have high therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the responses of plant populations dynamics to climatic variability is frustrated by the need for long-term datasets. Here, we advocate for new studies that estimate the effects of climate by sampling replicate populations in locations with similar climate. We first use data analysis on spatial locations in the conterminous USA to assess how far apart spatial replicates should be from each other to minimize temporal correlations in climate. We find that on average spatial locations separated by 316 Km (SD = 149Km) have moderate (0.5) correlations in annual precipitation. Second, we use simulations to demonstrate that spatial replication can lead to substantial gains in the range of climates sampled during a given set of years so long as the climate correlations between the populations are at low to moderate levels. Third, we use simulations to quantify how many spatial replicates would be necessary to achieve the same statistical power of a single-population, long-term data set under different strengths and directions of spatial correlations in climate between spatial replicates. Our results indicate that spatial replication is an untapped opportunity to study the effects of climate on demography and to rapidly fill important knowledge gaps in the field of population ecology.",

    "abstract": "Somatic mutations occur as random genetic changes in genes through protein-affecting mutations (PAMs), gene fusions, or copy number alterations (CNAs). Mutations of different types can have a similar phenotypic effect (i.e., allelic heterogeneity) and should be integrated into a unified gene mutation profile. We developed OncoMerge to fill this niche of integrating somatic mutations to capture allelic heterogeneity, assign a function to mutations, and overcome known obstacles in cancer genetics. Application of OncoMerge to the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas increased the number and frequency of somatically mutated genes and improved the prediction of the somatic mutation role as either activating or loss of function. Using integrated somatic mutation matrices increased the power to infer gene regulatory networks and uncovered the enrichment of switch-like feedback motifs and delay-inducing feed-forward loops. These studies demonstrate that OncoMerge efficiently integrates PAMs, fusions, and CNAs and strengthens downstream analyses linking somatic mutations to cancer phenotypes.\n\nMotivationGenes are mutated in tumors through either PAMs, CNAs, or gene fusions, thereby splitting the signal of the somatic mutation effect across these three mutation types. We developed OncoMerge to systematically integrate the three mutation types into a single mutation profile that better captures the impact of somatic mutations on cancer phenotypes. As a tool OncoMerge fills the gap between the sophisticated variant calling pipelines and downstream analyses.",

    "abstract": "Newly Born proteins, devoid of detectable homology to any other proteins, known as orphan proteins, occur in a single species or within a taxonomically restricted gene family. They are generated by expression of novel Open Reading Frames, and appear throughout evolution. We were curious if the three recently developed programs for predicting protein structures, viz., AlphaFold2, RoseTTAFold, and ESMFold, might be of value for comparison of such  Newly Born proteins to random polypeptides with amino acid content similar to that of native proteins, which have been called  Never Born proteins. The programs were used to compare the structures of two sets of  Never Born proteins that had been expressed - Group 1, which had been shown experimentally to possess substantial secondary structure, and Group 3, which had been shown to be intrinsically disordered. Overall, the models generated were scored as being of low quality but revealed some general principles. Specifically, all four members of Group 1 were predicted to be compact by all three algorithms. The members of Group 3 were predicted to be very extended, as would be expected for intrinsically disordered proteins. The three programs were then used to predict the structures of three orphan proteins whose crystal structures had been solved, two of which display novel folds. Finally, they were used to predict the structures of seven orphan proteins with well-identified biological functions, whose 3D structures are not known. Two proteins, which were predicted to be disordered based on their sequences, are predicted by all three structure algorithms to be extended structures. The other five were predicted to be compact structures with two exceptions in the case of AlphaFold2. All three prediction algorithms make remarkably similar and high-quality predictions for one large protein, HCO_11565, from a nematode. It is conjectured that this is due to many homologs in the taxonomically restricted family of which it is a member and to the fact that the Dali server revealed several non-related proteins with similar folds. Overall, orphan and taxonomically restricted proteins are often predicted to have compact 3D structures, sometimes with a novel fold that is a consequence of their novel sequences, which are associated with the appearance of new biological functions.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to heavy metals has been shown to cause damage to a variety of different tissues and cell types including hair cells, the sensory cells of our inner ears responsible for hearing and balance. Elevated levels of one such metal, cadmium, have been associated with hearing loss and shown to cause hair cell death in multiple experimental models. While the mechanisms of cadmium-induced cell death have been extensively studied in other cell types they remain relatively unknown in hair cells. We have found that calcium signaling, which is known to play a role in cadmium-induced cell death in other cell types through calmodulin and CaMKII activation as well as IP3 receptor and mitochondrial calcium uniporter mediated calcium flow, does not appear to play a significant role in cadmium-induced hair cell death. While calmodulin inhibition can partially protect hair cells this may be due to impacts on mechanotransduction activity. Removal of extracellular calcium, and inhibiting CaMKII, the IP3 receptor and the mitochondrial calcium uniporter all failed to protect against cadmium-induced hair cell death. We also found cadmium treatment increased pAkt levels in hair cells and pERK levels in supporting cells. This activation may be protective as inhibiting these pathways enhances cadmium-induced hair cell death rather than protecting cells. Thus cadmium-induced hair cell death appears distinct from cadmium-induced cell death in other cell types where calcium, Akt and ERK signaling all promote cell death.",

    "abstract": "Powassan virus is an emerging tick-borne virus of concern for public health, but very little is known about its transmission patterns and ecology. Here, we expanded the genomic dataset by sequencing 279 Powassan viruses isolated from Ixodes scapularis ticks from the northeastern United States. Our phylogeographic reconstructions revealed that Powassan virus lineage II was likely introduced or emerged from a relict population in the Northeast between 1940-1975. Sequences strongly clustered by sampling location, suggesting a highly focal geographical distribution. Our analyses further indicated that Powassan virus lineage II emerged in the northeastern U.S. mostly following a south to north pattern, with a weighted lineage dispersal velocity of ~3 km/year. Since the emergence in the Northeast, we found an overall increase in the effective population size of Powassan virus lineage II, but with growth stagnating during recent years. The cascading effect of population expansion of white-tailed deer and I. scapularis populations likely facilitated the emergence of Powassan virus in the northeastern U.S.\n\nSignificance statementOur work provides important fundamental insights in the local transmission dynamics of an emerging tick-borne pathogen of public health concern. Without the availability of vaccines or specific treatments, prevention of Powassan virus infection is dependent on education and control. We identified that Powassan virus is maintained in highly localized transmission foci that have been maintained for several years, without introductions of new virus clades. This provides both opportunities for better education about high risk areas and effective targeted control in Powassan virus foci with a long lasting impact.",

    "abstract": "The reference indexing problem for k-mers is to pre-process a collection of reference genomic sequences[R] so that the position of all occurrences of any queried k-mer can be rapidly identified. An efficient and scalable solution to this problem is fundamental for many tasks in bioinformatics.\n\nIn this work, we introduce the spectrum preserving tiling (SPT), a general representation of[R] that specifies how a set of tiles repeatedly occur to spell out the constituent reference sequences in[R] . By encoding the order and positions where tiles occur, SPTs enable the implementation and analysis of a general class of modular indexes. An index over an SPT decomposes the reference indexing problem for k-mers into: (1) a k-mer-to-tile mapping; and (2) a tile-to-occurrence mapping. Recently introduced work to construct and compactly index k-mer sets can be used to efficiently implement the k-mer-to-tile mapping. However, implementing the tile-to-occurrence mapping remains prohibitively costly in terms of space. As reference collections become large, the space requirements of the tile-to-occurrence mapping dominates that of the k-mer-to-tile mapping since the former depends on the amount of total sequence while the latter depends on the number of unique k-mers in[R] .\n\nTo address this, we introduce a class of sampling schemes for SPTs that trade off speed to reduce the size of the tile-to-reference mapping. We implement a practical index with these sampling schemes in the tool pufferfish2. When indexing over 30,000 bacterial genomes, pufferfish2 reduces the size of the tile-to-occurrence mapping from 86.3GB to 34.6GB while incurring only a 3.6x slowdown when querying k-mers from a sequenced readset.\n\nSupplementary materialsSections S.1 to S.8 available online at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7504717\n\nAvailabilitypufferfish2 is implemented in Rust and available at https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pufferfish2.",

    "abstract": "Most variants identified in human genome-wide association studies and scans for selection are non-coding. Interpretation of these variants effects and understanding of the way in which they contribute to phenotypic variation and adaptation in human populations is therefore limited by our understanding of gene regulation and by the difficulty in confidently linking non-coding variants to genes. To overcome this, we developed a gene-by-gene test for population-specific selection based on combinations of regulatory variants.\n\nWe extended the QX test for polygenic selection to test for selection on regulatory variants for 17,388 protein-coding genes across 2,504 individuals. We identified 45 genes with significant evidence (FDR <0.1) for selection, including FADS1, KHK, SULT1A2, ITGAM, and genes in the HLA region. We further confirm that significant selection signals do correspond to plausible population-level differences in predicted expression. However, we find that very few (0.2%) genes have strong evidence for directional, population-specific selection on the component of their expression that is predicted by cis-regulatory variants. While this is consistent with most cis-regulatory variation evolving under genetic drift or stabilizing selection, it is also possible that any effects are smaller than we can detect, or that population-specific selection is driven by tissue-specific or trans effects.\n\nOur gene-level QX score is independent of other methods for detecting selection based on genomic variation, may therefore be useful when used in combination with more traditional selection tests to specifically identify selection on regulatory variation. Overall, our results demonstrate the utility of one approach to combining population-level information with functional data to understand the evolution of gene expression.",

The perception of taste relies on new taste bud cells integrating with existing neural circuitry, yet how these new cells connect with a taste ganglion neuron is unknown. Do taste ganglion neurons remodel to accommodate taste bud cell renewal? If so, how much of the taste axon structure is fixed and how much remodels? Here we measured the motility and branching of individual taste arbors (the portion of the axon innervating taste buds) over time with two-photon in vivo microscopy. Terminal branches of taste arbors continuously and rapidly remodel within the taste bud. This remodeling is faster than predicted by taste bud cell renewal, with terminal branches added and lost concurrently. Surprisingly, ablating new taste cells with chemotherapeutic agents revealed that remodeling of the terminal branches of taste arbors does not rely of the renewal of taste bud cells. Although the arbor structure remodeling was fast and intrinsically controlled, no new arbors were added, and few were lost over 100 days. Taste ganglion neurons maintain a stable number of nerve arbors that are each capable of high-speed remodeling. Arbor structural plasticity would permit arbors to locate new taste bud cells, while stability of arbor number could support constancy in the degree of connectivity and function for each neuron over time.",

    "abstract": "Centromeres are chromosomal regions essential for coordinating chromosome segregation during cell division. While centromeres are defined by the presence of a centromere-specific histone H3 variant rather than a particular DNA sequence, they are typically embedded in repeat-dense chromosomal genome regions. In many species, centromeres are associated with transposable elements, but it is unclear if these elements are selfish or if they play a role in centromere specification or function. Here we use Drosophila melanogaster as a model to understand the evolution of centromere-associated transposable elements. G2/Jockey-3 is a non-LTR retroelement in the Jockey clade and the only sequence shared by all centromeres. We study the evolution of G2/Jockey-3 using short and long read population genomic data to infer insertion polymorphisms across the genome. We combine estimates of the age, frequency, and location of insertions to infer the evolutionary processes shaping G2/Jockey-3 and its association with the centromeres. We find that G2/Jockey-3 is an active retroelement targeted by the piRNA pathway that is enriched in centromeres at least in part due to an insertion bias. We do not detect signatures of positive selection on any G2/Jockey-3 insertions that would suggest than individual copies are favored by natural selection. Instead, we infer that most insertions are neutral or weakly deleterious both inside and outside of the centromeres. Therefore, G2/Jockey-3 evolution is consistent with it being a selfish genetic element that targets centromeres. We propose that targeting centromeres helps active retroelements escape host defenses, as the unique centromeric chromatin may prevent targeting by the host silencing machinery. At the same time, centromeric TEs insertions may be tolerated or even beneficial if they also contribute to the transcriptional and chromatin environment. Thus, we suspect centromere-associated retroelements like G2/Jockey-3 reflect a balance between conflict and cooperation at the centromeres.",

By analyzing publicly available small RNA-seq datasets, we observed that human cells infected by SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 produce multiple short viral RNAs (svRNAs), ranging in size from 15 to 26 nt and deriving predominantly from (+) RNA strands. In addition, we verified the presence of the five most abundant SARS-CoV-2 svRNAs in SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung adenocarcinoma cells by qPCR. Interestingly, the copy number of the observed SARS-CoV-2 svRNAs dramatically exceeded the expression of previously reported viral miRNAs in the same cells. We hypothesize that the reported SARS-CoV-2 svRNAs could serve as biomarkers for early infection stages due to their high abundance. Finally, we found that both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection induced up- and down-regulation of multiple endogenous human short RNAs that align predominantly to protein-coding and lncRNA transcripts. Interestingly, a significant proportion of short RNAs derived from full-length viral genomes also aligned to various hg38 sequences, suggesting opportunities to investigate regulatory roles of svRNAs during infection. Further characterization of the small RNA landscape of both viral and host genomes is clearly warranted to improve our understanding of molecular events related to infection and to design more efficient strategies for therapeutic interventions as well as early diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how community assembly during the initial faunization phases determines the difference in species richness is a fundamental question in ecology. However, there are few predictions for when and to what degree the differences in species richness between subcommunities will emerge. Here, we investigate the expectation of richness difference in a pair of subcommunities, assuming that species may have different and independent presence probabilities. We then introduce several indices and examine how expected richness difference is determined by the indices. We found that (i) species differences (the average of species presence probabilities in two subcommunities divided by the total presence probability) have inconsistent effects on richness difference; (ii) the degree of spatial heterogeneity (average of differences in species presence probabilities in two subcommunities across species) may, but not always, have a good predictive ability for richness difference; and (iii) the absolute difference in average presence probabilities (site-suitability difference) has robust predictive ability for richness difference unless richness difference is very small. This work provides a theoretical framework for predicting and analyzing species richness difference from presence-absence data based on null models.",

    "abstract": "Microbial polyketide synthase (PKS) genes encode the biosynthesis of many biomedically important natural products, yet only a small fraction of natures polyketide biosynthetic potential has been realized. Much of this potential originates from type I PKSs (T1PKSs), which can be delineated into different classes and subclasses based on domain organization and structural features of the compounds encoded. Notably, phylogenetic relationships among PKS ketosynthase (KS) domains provide a method to classify the larger and more complex genes in which they occur. Increased access to large metagenomic datasets from diverse habitats provides opportunities to assess T1PKS biosynthetic diversity and distributions through the analysis of KS domain sequences. Here, we used the webtool NaPDoS2 to detect and classify over 35,000 type I KS domains from 137 metagenomic data sets reported from eight diverse biomes. We found biome-specific separation with soils enriched in modular cis-AT and hybrid cis-AT KSs relative to other biomes and marine sediments enriched in KSs associated with PUFA and enediyne biosynthesis. By extracting full-length KS domains, we linked the phylum Actinobacteria to soil-specific enediyne and cis-AT clades and identified enediyne and monomodular KSs in phyla from which the associated compound classes have not been reported. These sequences were phylogenetically distinct from those associated with experimentally characterized PKSs suggesting novel structures or enzyme functions remain to be discovered. Lastly, we employed our metagenome-extracted KS domains to evaluate commonly used type I KS PCR primers and identified modifications that could increase the KS sequence diversity recovered from amplicon libraries.\n\nImportancePolyketides are a crucial source of medicines, agrichemicals, and other commercial products. Advances in our understanding of polyketide biosynthesis coupled with the accumulation of metagenomic sequence data provide new opportunities to assess polyketide biosynthetic potential across biomes. Here, we used the webtool NaPDoS2 to assess type I PKS diversity and distributions by detecting and classifying KS domains across 137 metagenomes. We show that biomes are differentially enriched in KS domain classes, providing a roadmap for future biodiscovery strategies. Further, KS phylogenies reveal both biome-specific clades that do not include biochemically characterized PKSs, highlighting the biosynthetic potential of poorly explored environments. The large metagenome-derived KS dataset allowed us to identify regions of commonly used type I KS PCR primers that could be modified to capture a larger extent of KS diversity. These results facilitate both the search for novel polyketides and our understanding of the biogeographical distribution of PKSs across earths major biomes.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) is a master regulator of translation control. eIF2B recycles inactive eIF2-GDP to active eIF2-GTP. Under transient/acute cellular stress, a family of kinases phosphorylate the alpha subunit of eIF2 (eIF2-P[S51]) activating the integrated stress response (ISR). This response pathway inhibits eIF2B activity resulting in overall translation attenuation and reprogramming of gene expression to overcome the stress. The duration of an ISR programme can dictate cell fate wherein chronic activation has pathological outcomes. Vanishing white matter disease (VWMD) is a chronic ISR-related disorder linked to mutations in eIF2B. eIF2B is vital to all cell types, yet VWMD eIF2B mutations primarily affect astrocytes and oligodendrocytes suggesting cell type-specific functions of eIF2B. Regulation of the cytoplasmic localisation of eIF2B (eIF2B bodies) has been implicated in the ISR. Here, we highlight the cell type specific localisation of eIF2B within neuronal and glial cell types. Our analyses revealed that each cell type possesses its own steady-state repertoire of eIF2B bodies with varied subunit composition and activity. We also demonstrate that neural and glial cell types respond similarly to acute induction of the ISR whilst a chronic ISR programme exerts cell type-specific differences. Regulatory composition of eIF2B bodies is suggested to be differentially modulated in a manner that correlates to the action of acute and chronic ISR. We also highlight a cell type specific response of the ISR inhibitor ISRIB on eIF2B localisation and activity.",

However, they also appear in many diseases such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, infections, inflammatory diseases, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Thus, it is necessary to have detection systems for lipids and amphiphilic molecules. Microbeads can be one of these systems for the simultaneous detection of different lipophilic biomarkers.\n\nMethodsBased on the fundamentals of microbead development, novel hydrophobic microbeads were produced. These not only have a hydrophobic surface, but are also fluorescently encoded and organic solvent resistant. The challenge after the development of the hydrophobic microbeads was to immobilise the amphiphilic molecules, in this study phospholipids, on the microbead surface in an oriented direction. After successful immobilisation of the biomarkers, a suitable antibody based detection assay was established.\n\nResultsBy passive adsorption, the phospholipids cardiolipin, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine could be bound to the microbead surface. With the application of the enzymes phospholipase A2 and phospholipase C, the directional binding of the phospholipids to the microbead surface was demonstrated. The detection of directional binding indicated the need for the hydrophobic surface. Microbeads with no hydrophobic surface bound the phospholipids non-directionally (with the hydrophilic head) and were thus no longer reactively accessible for detection.\n\nConclusionWith the newly developed hydrophobic, dual coded and solvent stable microbeads it is possible to bind amphiphilic biomolecules directionally onto the microbead surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) recognize pathogen effectors to mediate plant disease resistance, which is often accompanied by a localized host cell death response. Effectors can escape NLR recognition through various polymorphisms, allowing the pathogen to proliferate on previously resistant host plants. The powdery mildew effector AVRA13-1 is recognized by the barley NLR MLA13 and activates host cell death. We demonstrate here that a virulent form of AVRA13, called AVRA13-V2, escapes MLA13 recognition by substituting a serine for a leucine residue at the C-terminus. Counterintuitively, this substitution in AVRA13-V2 resulted in an enhanced MLA13 association and prevented the detection of AVRA13-1 by MLA13. Therefore, AVRA13-V2 is a dominant-negative form of AVRA13 and has likely contributed to the breakdown of Mla13 resistance. Despite this dominant-negative activity, AVRA13-V2 failed to suppress host cell death mediated by the MLA13 auto-active \"MHD\" variant. Neither AVRA13-1 nor AVRA13-V2 interacted with the MLA13 auto-active variant, implying that the binding moiety in MLA13 that mediates association with AVRA13-1 is altered after receptor activation. We also show that mutations in the MLA13 coiled-coil signalling domain, which were thought to impair Ca2+-channel activity and NLR function, instead resulted in MLA13 auto-active cell death. The data constitute an important step to define intermediate receptor conformations during NLR activation.",

Recent evidence indicates that a given memory is encoded by sparsely distributed neurons, highly activated during learning, the engram cells. Intriguingly, mechanisms that are of paramount importance for engram formation are impaired in DS. Here we explored engram formation in a DS mouse model, the Ts65Dn and we found a reduced number of engram cells in the dentate gyrus (DG), suggesting reduced neuronal allocation to engrams. We also show that trisomic engram cells present reduced number of mature spines than WT engram cells and their excitability is not enhanced during memory recall. In fact, activation of engram cells using a chemogenetic approach does not recover memory deficits in Ts65Dn. Altogether, our findings suggest that perturbations in engram neurons may play a significant role in memory alterations in DS.",

    "abstract": "Chilli is an important vegetable and spice crop, is known to be infected by several viruses. Techniques used in diagnosis of plant viral diseases before Next-generation sequencing (NGS) are having limitation of identifying the only known viruses. In the present study, virome analyses in infected chilli leaf samples was carried out using NGS to know the diversity of both known and unknown viruses associated with diseased symptoms. For virome profiling, samples from 19 fields were collected from chilli plants showing leaf curling, vein banding, mosaic, mottling, shoestring/rat tail/filiform/leathery and dull coloured leaves. Viral disease incidence in the surveyed fields varied from 26.66% to 47.50%. Total RNA was extracted from the 19 chilli leaf samples collected from fields and were pooled at equimolar concentration for virome profiling. From the rRNA-depleted pooled total RNA, mRNA and sRNA libraries were prepared and sequenced using Illumina NOVASEQ 6000 platform. Raw sequence data obtained was de novo assembled using three approaches; mRNAome with Trinity, sRNAome with Velvet and whole transcriptome (WT) with SPAdes assembly. Chilli virome, pairwise sequence identity and phylogenetic analyses revealed the presence of seven different viruses; chilli leaf curl virus (ChiLCV) along with its associated alpha and betasatellites, cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), groundnut bud necrosis orthotospovirus (GBNV), pepper cryptic virus-2 (PCV-2), pepper vein yellows virus (PeVYV), bell pepper alphaendornavirus (BPEV) and tobacco vein clearing virus (TVCV). From the virus associated contigs, complete/near-complete genomes for ChiLCV, CMV, PCV-2, PeVYV and BPEV and, partial genomes for GBNV and TVCV were reconstructed from the RNAome. Recombination breakpoint analyses revealed presence of recombination breakpoints in ChiLCV (coat protein and AC4 regions), CMV RNA2 (2a protein region) and P0, P3 and P5 protein regions of PeVYV. viruses identified in the current study are known to be originated from intra and interspecific recombination. Further, all the viruses detected in the pooled RNA sample were validated by PCR and loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using specific primers designed.

We analyze tree traits collected along an aridity gradient in Ghana, West Africa that shows little temperature variation, in an attempt to disentangle thermal and hydraulic influences on plant traits.\n\n(2) MethodsPredictions derived from optimality theory on the variation of key plant traits along the aridity gradient are tested with field measurements.\n\n(3) resultsMost photosynthetic traits show trends consistent with optimality-theory predictions, including higher photosynthetic capacity in the drier sites, and an association of higher photosynthetic capacity with greater respiration rates and greater water transport. Hydraulic traits show less consistency with theory or global-scale pattern, especially predictions based on xylem efficiency-safety tradeoff. Nonetheless, the link between photosynthesis and water transport still holds: species (predominantly deciduous species found in drier sites) with both higher sapwood-to-leaf area ratio (AS/AL) and potential hydraulic conductivity (Kp), implying higher transpiration, tend to have both higher photosynthetic capacity and lower leaf-internal CO2.\n\n(4) ConclusionsThese results indicate that aridity is an independent driver of spatial patterns of photosynthetic traits, while plants show a diversity of water-transport strategies along the aridity gradient.\n\nPlain language summaryAlong an aridity gradient in Ghana, West-Africa, we used optimality theory to explain that aridity is an important driver of photosynthetic traits, independent of temperature. Toward drier sites, plants have higher photosynthetic capacities per leaf area but have fewer leaves. We also explain how plants arrange water transportation to support quicker photosynthesis at drier sites. However, plants at the drier sites seem to have diverse combinations of hydraulic traits to satisfy the need for photosynthesis. We reported surprising data-theory inconsistency for some hydraulic traits along the aridity gradient where further research is needed.",

Determining the optimal balance between explore and exploit is a computationally intractable problem, necessitating the use of heuristics. We looked to nature to measure and model the solutions used by organisms. Here we show that the electric fish Eigenmannia virescens uses a salience-dependent mode-switching strategy to solve the explore-exploit conflict during a refuge tracking task. The fish produced distinctive non-Gaussian (i.e., non-normal) distributions of movement velocities characterized by sharp peaks for slower, task-oriented \"exploit\" movements and broad shoulders for faster, \"explore\" movements. The measures of non-normality increased in relation to increased sensory salience. Data from ten phylogenetically diverse organisms, from amoebae to humans, revealed the same distinctive distribution of movement velocities that were also modulated in relation to sensory salience. We propose a state-uncertainty based mode-switching heuristic that (1) reproduces the distinctive velocity distribution, (2) rationalizes modulation by sensory salience, and (3) outperforms the classic persistent excitation approach while using less energy. This mode-switching heuristic provides insights to purposeful exploratory behaviors in organisms as well as a framework for more efficient state estimation and control of robots.",

    "abstract": "Sensors of intracellular double-stranded RNA are central components of metazoan innate antiviral immunity, but such sensors have not been identified in plants. RNA interference (RNAi) constitutes a potent plant antiviral defense mechanism that relies on conversion of viral RNA into small interfering RNAs by two DICER-LIKE (DCL) ribonucleases, DCL4 and DCL2. Here, we show that while plant DCL4 is dedicated to RNAi, cytoplasmic dicing by DCL2 also triggers RNAi-independent defense gene expression via at least two intracellular nucleotide-binding domain/leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors. Combined DCL4/NLR inactivation abrogates basal resistance to a positive strand RNA virus. Our results redefine the basis of plant antiviral immunity, including autoimmunity as an explanation for DCL2-dependent growth arrest in dcl and RNA decay mutants in several plant species.\n\nOne sentence summaryThe plant immune system uses Dicer-like ribonucleases for both antiviral RNA interference and double-stranded RNA sensing.",

    "abstract": "Higher plants encode four DICER-LIKE (DCL) enzymes responsible for the production of small non-coding RNAs which function in RNA interference (RNAi). Different RNAi pathways in plants effect transposon silencing, antiviral defense and endogenous gene regulation. DCL2 acts genetically redundantly with DCL4 to confer basal antiviral defense, but in other settings, DCL2 has the opposite function of DCL4, at least in formal genetic terms. For example, knockout of DCL4 causes growth defects that are suppressed by inactivation of DCL2. Current models maintain that the biochemical basis of both of these effects is RNAi via DCL2-dependent small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Here, we report that neither DCL2-mediated antiviral resistance nor growth defects can be explained by silencing effects of DCL2-dependent siRNAs. Both functions are defective in genetic backgrounds that maintain high levels of DCL2-dependent siRNAs, either through specific point mutations in DCL2 or simply by reducing DCL2 dosage in plants heterozygous for dcl2 knockout alleles. Intriguingly, however, all functions of DCL2 depend on it having some level of catalytic activity. We discuss this requirement for catalytic activity, but not for the resulting siRNAs, in the light of recent findings that reveal a function of DCL2 in activation of innate immunity in response to cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing problem, especially in Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae such as Klebsiella pneumoniae. Horizontal transfer of conjugative plasmids contributes to AMR gene dissemination. Bacteria such as K. pneumoniae commonly exist in biofilms, yet most studies focus on planktonic cultures. Here we studied the transfer of a multidrug resistance plasmid in planktonic and biofilm populations of K. pneumoniae. We determined plasmid transfer from a clinical isolate, CPE16, which carried four plasmids, including the 119-kbp blaNDM-1-bearing F-type plasmid pCPE16_3, in planktonic and biofilm conditions. We found that transfer frequency of pCPE16_3 in a biofilm was orders-of-magnitude higher than between planktonic cells. In 5/7 sequenced transconjugants multiple plasmids had transferred. Plasmid acquisition had no detectable growth impact on transconjugants. Gene expression of the recipient and a transconjugant was investigated by RNA-sequencing in three lifestyles: planktonic exponential growth, planktonic stationary phase, and biofilm. We found that lifestyle had a substantial impact on chromosomal gene expression, and plasmid carriage affected chromosomal gene expression most in stationary planktonic and biofilm lifestyles. Furthermore, expression of plasmid genes was lifestyle-dependent, with unique signatures across the three conditions. Our study shows that growth in biofilm greatly increased the risk of conjugative transfer of a carbapenem resistance plasmid in K. pneumoniae without fitness costs and minimal transcriptional rearrangements, thus highlighting the importance of biofilms in the spread of AMR in this opportunistic pathogen.\n\nImportanceCarbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae is particularly problematic in hospital settings. Carbapenem resistance genes can transfer between bacteria via plasmid conjugation. Alongside drug resistance, K. pneumoniae can form biofilms on hospital surfaces, at infection sites and on implanted devices. Biofilms are naturally protected and can be inherently more tolerant to antimicrobials than their free-floating counterparts. There have been indications that plasmid transfer may be more likely in biofilm populations, thus creating a conjugation  hotspot. However, there is no clear consensus on the effect of the biofilm lifestyle on plasmid transfer. Therefore, we aimed to explore the relationship between plasmid transfer and biofilms, and the impact of plasmid acquisition on the host bacterial cell. Our data show resistance plasmid transfer is greatly increased in a biofilm versus planktonic growth, which may be a significant contributing factor to the rapid dissemination of resistance plasmids in K. pneumoniae.",

    "abstract": "Rubisco is the primary entry point for carbon into the biosphere. It has been widely proposed that rubisco is highly constrained by catalytic trade-offs due to correlations between the enzymes kinetic traits across species. In previous work, we have shown that these correlations, and thus the strength of catalytic trade-offs, have been over-estimated due to the presence of phylogenetic signal in the kinetic trait data (Bouvier et al., 2021). We demonstrated that only canonical trade-offs between the Michaelis constant for CO2 and carboxylase turnover, and between the Michaelis constants for CO2 and O2 were robust to phylogenetic effects. We further demonstrated that phylogenetic constraints have limited rubisco adaptation to a greater extent than the combined action of catalytic trade-offs. Recently, however, our claims have been contested by Tcherkez and Farquhar (2021), who have argued that the phylogenetic signal we detect in rubisco kinetic traits is an artefact of species sampling, the use of rbcL-based trees for phylogenetic inference, laboratory-to-laboratory variability in kinetic measurements, and homoplasy of the C4 trait. In the present article, we respond to these criticisms on a point-by-point basis and conclusively show that all are either incorrect or invalid. As such, we stand by our original conclusions. Specifically, the magnitude of rubisco catalytic trade-offs have been overestimated in previous analyses due to phylogenetic biases, and rubisco kinetic evolution has in fact been more limited by phylogenetic constraint.",

    "abstract": "Nuptial gift-giving occurs in several taxonomic groups including insects, snails, birds, squid, arachnids and humans. Although this trait has evolved many times independently, no general framework has been developed to predict the conditions necessary for nuptial gift-giving to evolve. We use a time-in time-out model to derive analytical results describing the requirements necessary for selection to favour nuptial gift-giving. Specifically, selection will favour nuptial gift-giving if the fitness increase caused by gift-giving exceeds the product of expected gift search time and encounter rate of the opposite sex. Selection will favour choosiness in the opposite sex if the value of a nuptial gift exceeds the inverse of offspring processing time multiplied by the rate at which mates with nuptial gifts are encountered. Importantly, selection can differ between the sexes, potentially causing sexual conflict. We test these results using an individual-based model applied to a system of nuptial gift-giving spiders, Pisaura mirabilis, by estimating parameter values using experimental data from several studies. Our results provide a general framework for understanding when the evolution of nuptial gift-giving can occur, and also provide novel insight into the evolution of worthless nuptial gifts, which occur in multiple taxonomic groups with implications for understanding parental investment.",

    "abstract": "Due to global climate cooling and aridification since the Paleogene, the members of the Neogene flora were extirpated from the Northern Hemisphere or were confined to a few refugial areas. For some species, the final reduction/extinction came in the Pleistocene, but some others have survived climatic transformations up to the present. This has occurred in Castanea sativa, a species of high commercial value in Europe and a significant component of the Caucasian forests biodiversity. In contrast to the European range, neither the historical biogeography nor the population genetic structure of the species in the isolated Caucasian range has been clarified. Here, based on a survey of 21 natural populations from the Caucasus and a single one from Europe, we provide likely biogeographic reconstruction and genetic diversity details. By applying Bayesian inference, species distribution modelling, and fossil pollen data, we estimated (1) the time of the Caucasian - European divergence during the Middle Pleistocene (436.5 ka), (2) the time of divergence among Caucasian lineages, and (3) outlined the glacial refugia for species. The climate changes related to the Early Middle Pleistocene Transition and the alpine orogenic uplift in the region are proposed as the major drivers of the intraspecific divergence and European-Caucasian disjunction, while the impact of the last glacial cycle was of marginal importance.",

    "abstract": "The xylem network, the water conduction system in wood determines the ability of trees to avoid hydraulic failure during drought stress. The capability to withstand embolisms, disruptions of the water column by gas bubbles that contribute to hydraulic failure, is mainly determined by the anatomical arrangement and connectedness (topology) of xylem vessels. However, the quantification of xylem network characteristics has been difficult, so that relating network properties and topology to hydraulic vulnerability and predicting xylem function remains challenging. We studied the xylem vessel networks of three diffuse- (Fagus sylvatica, Liriodendron tulipifera, Populus x canadensis) and three ring-porous (Carya ovata, Fraxinus pennsylvatica, Quercus montana) tree species using volumetric images of xylem from laser ablation tomography (LATscan). Using convolutional neural networks for image segmentation, we generated three-dimensional, high-resolution maps of xylem vessels, with detailed measurements of morphology and topology. We studied the network topologies by incorporating multiple network metrics into a multidimensional analysis and simulated the robustness of these networks against the loss of individual vessel elements that mimic the obstruction of water flow from embolisms. This analysis suggested that networks in Populus x canadensis and Carya ovata are quite similar despite being different wood types. Similar networks had comparable experimental measurements of P50 values (pressure inducing 50% hydraulic conductivity loss) obtained from hydraulic vulnerability curves, a common tool to quantify the cavitation resistance of xylem networks. This work produced novel data on plant xylem vessel networks and introduces new methods for analyzing the biological impact of these network structures.\n\nSignificance statementThe resilience of fluid transport networks such as xylem vessels that conduct water in trees depends on both the structure of the network and features of the individual network elements. High-resolution reconstruction of xylem networks from six tree species provided novel, three-dimensional, structural data which enabled the xylem networks to be described using graph theory. Using an array of network metrics as multidimensional descriptors, we compared the xylem networks between species and showed relationships to simulated and experimental measures of drought resistance. In addition to providing insight on drought resistance, these approaches offer new ways for comparative analysis of networks applicable to many systems.",

    "abstract": "MADS-box transcription factors (TFs) are broadly present in eukaryotes. Varying by domain architecture, MADS-box TFs in land plants are categorized into Type I (M-type) and Type II (MIKC-type). For about twenty years, Type I and II genes were considered orthologous to the SRF and MEF2 genes in animals, respectively, presumably originating from a duplication before the divergence of eukaryotes. Here, we exploited the increasing eukaryotic MADS-box sequences and reassessed their evolution. While supporting the ancient duplication giving rise to SRF- and MEF2-types, we found that Type I and II genes originated from the MEF2-type genes through another duplication in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of land plants. Protein structures predicted by AlphaFold2 and OmegaFold support our phylogenetic analyses, with plant Type I and II TFs resembling the MEF2-type structure, rather than SRFs. We hypothesize that the ancestral SRF-type TFs got lost in the MRCA of Archaeplastida (the kingdom Plantae sensu lato). The retained MEF2-type TFs acquired a Keratin-like domain and became MIKC-type upon the evolution of Streptophyta. Subsequently in the MRCA of land plants, M-type TFs evolved from a duplicated MIKC-type precursor through loss of the Keratin-like domain, leading to the Type I clade. Both Type I and II TFs largely expanded and functionally differentiated in concert with the increasing complexity of land plant body architecture. We attribute the adaptation to the terrestrial environment partly to the divergence among MEF2-type MADS-box genes and the repetitive recruitment of these originally stress-responsive TFs into developmental programs, especially those underlying reproduction.",

Multiple phylogenetic inferences using molecular data recover the genus as sister to a clade comprising mycoheterotrophic Thismiaceae and the photosynthetic family Taccaceae, contrary to earlier placements of Afrothismia and Thismiaceae within Burmanniaceae. Morphological support for separating Afrothismia from the rest of Thismiaceae has depended on the zygomorphic flowers of Afrothismia (although some South American species of Thismia are also zygomorphic) and their clusters of root tubers, each with a terminal rootlet. The number of described species of Afrothismia has recently increased substantially, from four to 16, which has provided additional morphological characters that support its distinction from Thismiaceae. Most notably, the ovary in Afrothismia has a single stalked placenta, and circumscissile fruits from which seeds are exserted by placental elevation (in Thismiaceae, in contrast, there are three placentas, a deliquescing fruit lid, and the seeds are not exserted). Afrothismia stamens are inserted in the lower perianth tube where they are attached to the stigma, and individual flowers are subtended by a single large dorsal bract (in Thismiaceae, stamens are inserted at the mouth of the tube, free of and distant from the stigma, and each flower is subtended by a loose whorl of (2-)3(-4) bracts). Here we formally characterise Afrothismiaceae and review what is known of its development, seed germination, interactions with mycorrhizal Glomeromycota, biogeography, phylogeny and pollination biology. All but one (Afrothismia insignis; Vulnerable) of the 13 species assessed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species are either Endangered or Critically Endangered; one species (A. pachyantha Schltr.) is considered to be extinct.",

    "abstract": "Epidural electrical stimulation (EES) of the spinal cord has been FDA approved and used therapeutically for decades. However, there is still not a clear understanding of the local neural substrates and consequently the mechanism of action responsible for the therapeutic effects. Epidural spinal recordings (ESR) are collected from the electrodes placed in the epidural space. ESR contains multi-modality signal components such as the evoked neural response (due to tonic or BurstDR waveforms), evoked muscle response, stimulation artifact, and cardiac response. The tonic stimulation evoked compound action potential (ECAP) is one of the components in ESR and has been proposed recently to measure local neural activation during EES. Here, we first review and investigate the referencing strategies, as they apply to ECAP component in ESR in the domestic swine animal model. We then examine how ECAP component can be used to sense lead migration, an adverse outcome following lead placement that can reduce therapeutic efficacy. Lastly, we show and isolate concurrent activation of local back and leg muscles during EES, demonstrating that the ESR obtained from the recording contacts contain both ECAP and EMG components. These findings may further guide the implementation of recording and reference contacts in an implantable EES system and provide preliminary evidence for the utility of ECAP component in ESR to detect lead migration. We expect these results to facilitate future development of EES methodology and implementation of use of different components in ESR to improve EES therapy.",

Literature reported previously altered muscle properties such as lower number of satellite cells (SCs), with altered fusion capacity.

Myogenic differentiation of SCs from the Medial Gastrocnemius (MG) muscle of patients with CP (n=16, 3-9 years old) showed higher fusion capacity compared to age-matched typically developing children (TD, n=13). Furthermore, we uniquely assessed cells of two different lower limb muscles and showed a decreased myogenic potency in cells from the Semitendinosus (ST) compared to the MG. Longitudinal assessments, one year after the first botulinum toxin treatment, showed slightly reduced SC representations and lower fusion capacity. Finally, we proved the robustness of our data, by assessing in parallel the myogenic capacity of two samples from the same TD muscle.\n\nIn conclusion, these data confirmed previous findings of increased SC fusion capacity from MG muscle of young patients with CP compared to age-matched TD. Further elaboration is reported on potential factors contributing to heterogeneity, such as assessed muscle, CP progression and reliability of primary outcome parameters.",

    "abstract": "Genotype-phenotype association tests are typically adjusted for population stratification using principal components that are estimated genome-wide. This lacks resolution when analysing populations with fine structure and/or individuals with fine levels of admixture. This can affect power and precision, and is a particularly relevant consideration when control individuals are recruited using geographic selection criteria. Such is the case in France where we have recently created reference panels of individuals anchored to different geographic regions. To make correct comparisons against case groups, who would likely be gathered from large urban areas, new methods are needed.\n\nWe present SURFBAT (a SURrogate Family Based Association Test) which performs an approximation of the transmission-disequilibrium test. Our method hinges on the application of genotype imputation algorithms to match similar haplotypes between the case and control groups. This permits us to approximate local ancestry informed posterior probabilities of un-transmitted parental alleles of each case individual. SURFBAT provides an association test that is inherently robust to fine-scale population stratification and opens up the possibility of efficiently using large imputation reference panels as control groups for association testing. The method is suitable when the control panel spans the local ancestry spectrum of the case-group population and each control has similar paternal and maternal ancestries. This is the case for our reference panels where individuals have their four grand-parents born in the same geographic area. In contrast to other methods for association testing that incorporate local-ancestry inference, SURFBAT does not require a set of ancestry groups to be defined, nor for local ancestry to be explicitly estimated.\n\nWe demonstrate the interest of our tool on simulated datasets created from the 1000 Genomes project and the FranceGenRef project, as well as on a real-data example for a group of case individuals affected by Brugada syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The ability to individually predict disease course of major depressive disorder (MDD) is essential for optimal treatment planning. Here, we use a data-driven machine learning approach to assess the predictive value of different sets of biological data (whole-blood proteomics, lipid-metabolomics, transcriptomics, genetics), both separately and added to clinical baseline variables, for the longitudinal prediction of 2-year MDD chronicity (defined as presence of MDD diagnosis after 2 years) at the individual subject level. Prediction models were trained and cross-validated in a sample of 643 patients with current MDD (2-year chronicity n = 318) and subsequently tested for performance in 161 MDD individuals (2-year chronicity n = 79). Proteomics data showed best unimodal data predictions (AUROC = 0.68). Adding proteomic to clinical data at baseline significantly improved 2-year MDD chronicity predictions (AUROC = 0.63 vs AUROC = 0.78, p = 0.013), while the addition of other -omics data to clinical data did not yield significantly increased model performance. SHAP and enrichment analysis revealed proteomic analytes involved in inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, with fibrinogen levels showing the highest variable importance, followed by symptom severity. Machine learning models outperformed psychiatrists ability to predict two-year chronicity (balanced accuracy = 71% vs 55%). This study showed the added predictive value of combining proteomic, but not other -omic data, with clinical data. Adding other -omic data to proteomics did not further improve predictions. Our results reveal a novel multimodal signature of MDD chronicity that shows clinical potential for individual MDD disease course predictions from baseline measurements.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the molecular basis of sport mutations in fruit trees can accelerate breeding of novel cultivars. For this, we analyzed the DNA of the apple tree that evolved the RubyMac phenotype through a sport mutation that introduced changes in fruit coloration in upper branches of the tree. Unexpectedly, we not only found 46 de novo mutations, but also 54 somatic gene conversions (i.e., loss-of-heterozygosity mutations) distinguishing the mutant and wild-type branches of the tree. Approximately 30% of the de novo mutations and 80% of the gene conversions were observed only in specific cells layers suggesting that they occurred in the corresponding meristematic layers. Interestingly, the de novo mutations were enriched for GC=>AT transitions, while the gene conversions showed the opposite bias for AT=>GC transitions suggesting that GC-biased gene conversions have the potential to counteract the AT-bias of de novo mutations. By comparing the gene expression patterns in fruit skins from mutant and wild-type branches, we found 56 differentially expressed genes including 18 that were involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis. While none of the differently expressed genes harbored a mutation, we found that some of the mutations affected the integrity of candidate genes in regions of the genome that were recently associated with natural variation in fruit coloration.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTranslational efforts on spike-signal-based implantable brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are increasingly aiming to minimise bandwidth while maintaining decoding performance. Developing these BMIs requires advances in neuroscience and electronic technology, as well as using low-complexity spike detection algorithms and high-performance machine learning models. While some state-of-the-art BMI systems jointly design spike detection algorithms and machine learning models, it remains unclear how the detection performance affects decoding.\n\nApproachWe propose the co-design of the neural decoder with an ultra-low complexity spike detection algorithm. The detection algorithm is designed to attain a target firing rate, which the decoder uses to modulate the input features preserving statistical invariance.\n\nMain resultsWe demonstrate a multiplication-free fixed-point spike detection algorithm with nearly perfect detection accuracy and the lowest complexity among studies we have seen. By co-designing the system to incorporate statistically invariant features, we observe significantly improved long-term stability, with decoding accuracy degrading by less than 10% after 80 days of operation. Our analysis also reveals a nonlinear relationship between spike detection and decoding performance. Increasing the detection sensitivity improves decoding accuracy and long-term stability, which means the activity of more neurons is beneficial despite the detection of more noise. Reducing the spike detection sensitivity still provides acceptable decoding accuracy whilst reducing the bandwidth by at least 30%.\n\nSignificanceOur findings regarding the relationship between spike detection and decoding performance can provide guidance on setting the threshold for spike detection rather than relying on training or trial-and-error. The trade-off between data bandwidth and decoding performance can be effectively managed using appropriate spike detection settings. We demonstrate improved decoding performance by maintaining statistical invariance of input features. We believe this approach can motivate further research focused on improving decoding performance through the manipulation of data itself (based on a hypothesis) rather than using more complex decoding models.",

CellCharter outperformed existing methods, identified biologically meaningful cellular niches in different contexts, and discovered spatial cancer cell states, characterized by cell-intrinsic features and spatial interactions between tumor and immune cells. In non-small cell lung cancer, CellCharter revealed a cellular niche composed of neutrophils and tumor cells expressing markers of hypoxia and cell migration. Expression of these markers determined a spatial gradient associated with cancer cell state transition and neutrophil infiltration. Moreover, CellCharter showed that similar compositions of immune cell types can exhibit remarkably different spatial organizations in different tumors, highlighting the need for exploring spatial cell interactions to decipher intratumor heterogeneity.

This has attracted significant attention, especially for the application of AlphaFold in drug discovery. However, how to take full advantage of AlphaFold to assist with virtual screening remains elusive. We evaluate the AlphaFold structures of 51 selected targets from the DUD-E database in virtual screening. Our analyses show that the virtual screening performance of about 35% of the AlphaFold structures is equivalent to that of DUD-E structures, and about 25% of the AlphaFold structures yield better results than the DUD-E structures. Remarkably, AlphaFold structures produce slightly better results than the Apo structures. Moreover, we develop a new consensus scoring method based on Z-score standardization and exponential function, which shows improved screening performance compared to traditional scoring methods. By implementing a multi-stage virtual screening process and the new consensus scoring method, we are able to improve the speed of virtual screening by about nine times without compromising the enrichment factor. Overall, our results provide insights into the potential use of AlphaFold in drug discovery and highlight the value of consensus scoring and multi-stage virtual screening.",

    "abstract": "Genome-level sequencing enables us to ask fundamental questions about the genetic basis of adaptation, population structure, and epigenetic mechanisms, but usually requires a suitable reference genome for mapping population-level re-sequencing data. In some model systems, multiple reference genomes are available, giving researchers the challenging task of determining which reference genome best suits their data. Here we compare the use of two different reference genomes for the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), one novel genome derived from a European gynogenetic individual and the published reference genome of a North American individual. Specifically, we investigate the impact of using a local reference versus one generated from a distinct lineage on several common population genomics analyses. Through mapping genome resequencing data of 60 sticklebacks from across Europe and North America, we demonstrate that genetic distance among samples and the reference impacts downstream analyses. Using a local reference genome increased mapping efficiency and genotyping accuracy, effectively retaining more and better data. Despite comparable distributions of the metrics generated across the genome using SNP data (i.e., {pi}, Tajimas D, and FST), window-based statistics using different references resulted in different outlier genes and enriched gene functions. A marker-based analysis of DNA methylation distributions had a comparably high overlap in outlier genes and functions, yet with distinct differences depending on the reference genome. Overall, our results highlight how using a local reference genome decreases reference bias to increase confidence in downstream analyses of the data. Such results have significant implications in all reference-genome-based population genomic analyses.",

It is therefore essential to establish a robust method for the isolation and culture of epithelial cells from nasal polyps to enable further research. In this study, the feasibility of the outgrowth technique for the isolation of the epithelial cells from the nasal polyps was evaluated.\n\nMethodsThe outgrowth technique was performed to isolate the epithelial cells. Proliferation was evaluated up to the 3rd passage. Epithelial cells were identified and differentiation and proliferation were evaluated using flow cytometry with anti-cytokeratin, anti-p63, and anti-Ki-67. A functionality test was assessed by determining type 2-relevant proteins using ELISA, representatively, interleukin-33 and periostin.\n\nResultsUsing the outgrowth technique, epithelial cells could be isolated from all tissue samples. Isolated epithelial cells showed a proliferation rate of approximately 7- to 23-fold every 6 days up to the 3rd passage. Over 97% of isolated cells were shown to be cytokeratin- and p63-positive, and over 86% of them were Ki-67-positive in flow cytometry.

By using multiple microscopic techniques, biochemical approaches in various mutant mice and longitudinal analysis from mouse embryogenesis to aging, we show that ChP cilia are built on a gradient of events which are spatio-temporally regulated. We uncover that ChP cilia develop prenatally since early tissue morphogenesis, and proceeds as a multi-step process characterized by basal body multiplication and axoneme formation directly at the apical cellular compartment. Our data also show that choroid plexus cilia contain both primary and motile features. Remarkably, we demonstrate that ChP cilia undergo axoneme resorption, starting from early youth, through a tubulin destabilization process, which is primarily controlled by polyglutamylation levels and could be mitigated by the removal of the microtubule-severing enzyme spastin.

    "abstract": "The species-area relationship (SAR) is a fundamental pattern of island biogeography which is often curvilinear due to reduced accumulation of species on mid-sized island caused by island isolation and the lack of speciation present on larger islands. The curvature of SARs represents lower saturation of species on mid-sized islands and therefore accelerated species accumulation should linearize island SARs. In the Anthropocene, island species accumulation has accelerated from introduced species. We hypothesize three new patterns. First, the saturation of species for the most unsaturated islands should increase more from introduced species than other islands. Second, SARs should become more linear as islands accumulate more species. Third, introduced species should greatly accelerate the island saturation process. We assessed these patterns for the reptile and amphibian of the Caribbean, a global hotspot of biodiversity. Mid-sized Caribbean islands are now more saturated causing a linearization of contemporary herpetofauna SARs resulting from a ca. 30 myr and 40 myr acceleration of island saturation for reptiles and amphibians, respectively. Thus, humans within the last few hundreds of years--starting with European colonization of the Americas--have greatly accelerated the natural process of island saturation by 30 million years within the Caribbean global biodiversity hotspot.",

We developed mushroom models with Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) producing various colors: green, blue, red, and yellow. Over three consecutive evenings after sunset, we applied Tanglefoot invertebrate-trapping glue to both mushroom models and actual mushrooms, and collected the traps before sunrise, then identified the trapped invertebrates to Order. We found green LED traps attracted more invertebrates than non-lit control traps, suggesting that light functions to attract invertebrates. The majority of invertebrates attracted to the green lights were Dipteran flies, who would be capable of dispersing fungal spores. The higher-intensity green LEDs attracted more total invertebrates than the dimmer mushrooms, but the results were not significant. Though we predicted that the invertebrate assemblages attracted to green lights would be similar to the invertebrate assemblage attracted to actual mushrooms, the results were not significant. Similarly, the red, blue, and yellow LEDs attracted fewer invertebrates than the green LEDs, but the differences in community composition were not statistically significant. Our findings corroborate other similar studies in tropical regions that found bioluminescent mushrooms may attract invertebrates.",

    "abstract": "Nest site selection is the principal way secondary cavity-nesting species mitigate the negative effects of factors such as predation, parasitism and exposure on productivity. High-quality cavities could then be expected to be selected in response to the primary threat to nest success. Understanding how demographic rates are affected by anthropogenic changes to ecosystems is vital if effective conservation management strategies are to be developed and implemented. Large-bodied secondary cavity-nesting birds rely on large cavities in mature trees that are often absent or reduced in anthropogenically disturbed forests. Thus, the availability of high-quality nest sites may be limited for these species, potentially reducing productivity. The aim of this study was to investigate nest-site selection and the effect of nest-site features on productivity in the critically endangered great green macaw (Ara ambiguus) in northern Costa Rica. We show that great green macaws select nest sites according to the characteristics of the cavity and of the tree in which they are located. Moreover, productivity was a function of certain cavity features. We conclude that great green macaws are not reliant on primary forest for nest sites and typically choose cavities in remnant, isolated trees in pasture or young secondary forests.",

    "abstract": "Accurately measuring individual feed intake is required to include feed efficiency (FE) as an objective in commercial breeding programs. Phenotyping individual feed intake through direct measurements remains complex in fish reared in groups. One way to overcome this challenge is to find proxies for estimating FE. This study aimed to investigate the correlations between fish FE and potential predictive criteria in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. As predictive criteria, we considered the variations of body weight assessed as thermal growth coefficients (TGC) and the feeding behaviour assessed as the number of feed demands over a period and the proportion of the demands made before noon. Feed intake was assessed over three different periods in ten isogenic lines allowing a recording for each of the ten genotypes while keeping fish in groups. The protocol consisted of two successive feed deprivation and refeeding phases after initial basal growth periods. Correlations were then calculated between FE, measured either as feed conversion ratio (FCR) or residual feed intake (RFI), and the different indirect criteria. We found positive phenotypic correlations between FCR and RFI over the feed intake measurement periods (r [&gt;=] 0.79, P < 0.001). Assessment of the relationship between FE traits (FCR and RFI) calculated over the three measurement periods and TGC revealed no significant association. We found significant positive correlations between RFI calculated from the first feed intake measurement period and feeding behaviour, assessed as the number of feed demands (r = 0.42-0.49, P [&lt;=] 0.022). Nevertheless, such correlations were not established for the two other measurement periods following feed deprivation. While we demonstrated that the weight variations during feed deprivation are not a good proxy for FE (FCR or RFI) in rainbow trout, we also highlighted the interest in exploring more the relationships between FE and feeding behaviour in fish.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) is a valuable fruit crop in the Rosaceae family and a hybrid between progenitors most closely related to extant P. fruticosa (ground cherry) and P. avium (sweet cherry). Sour cherry is an allotetraploid with few genomic resources, so a genome sequence would greatly facilitate the improvement of this crop. In Prunus, two known classes of genes are of particular importance to breeding strategies: the self-incompatibility loci (S-alleles), which determine compatible crosses and are critically important for successful fertilization and fruit set, and the Dormancy Associated MADS-box genes (DAMs), which strongly affect dormancy transitions and flowering time.\n\nResultsHere we report a chromosome-scale genome assembly for sour cherry cultivar  Montmorency, the predominant sour cherry cultivar grown in the U.S. We also generated a draft assembly of P. fruticosa to use alongside a published P. avium sequence for syntelog-based subgenome assignments for  Montmorency. Using hierarchal k-mer clustering and phylogenomics, we provide compelling evidence this allotetraploid is trigenomic, containing two distinct subgenomes inherited from a P. fruticosa-like ancestor (A and A) and two copies of the same subgenome inherited from a P. avium-like ancestor (BB). We therefore assigned the genome composition of  Montmorency to be AABB and show little to no recombination has occurred between progenitor subgenomes (A/A and B). The S-alleles and DAMs in  Montmorency and P. fruticosa were manually annotated and demonstrated to support the three subgenome assignments. Lastly, the hybridization event that  Montmorency is descended from was estimated to have occurred less than 1.61 million years ago, making sour cherry a relatively recent allotetraploid.\n\nConclusionsThe genome of sour cherry cultivar Montmorency highlights the evolutionary complexity of the genus Prunus. These genomic resources will inform future breeding strategies for sour cherry, comparative genomics in the Rosaceae, and questions regarding neopolyploidy.",

    "abstract": "In concert with irreversible non-equilibrium peptide translation by the ribosome, the nascent polypeptide chain may integrate into the membrane or translocate to the other side of the membrane, facilitated by the conserved protein translocation channel SecYEG in bacteria and Sec61 in eukaryotes. Assuming equilibrium for the decision processes yielded the biological hydrophobicity scale, reflecting free-energy differences {Delta}G between the pore interior and membrane. Yet kinetic effects and molecular dynamic simulations suggested that a nascent polypeptide could not sample the two separate environments a sufficient number of times for partitioning in equilibrium. Here we tested the hypothesis employing purified and reconstituted SecYEG harboring a stalled ribosome nascent chain (RNC). The SecYEG-RNC complex was open in a de-energized membrane, allowing ion flow. Application of a membrane potential closed the channel if nascent chain hydrophobicity permitted membrane integration. Taking the ratio of steady-state to initial ion conductances as a measure of nascent chain hydrophobicity, we found {Delta}G for KvAPs voltage sensor (4th helix harboring four arginines) and FtsQs transmembrane helix to be equal to 0.3 and -2.1 kcal/mol, respectively. Thus, {Delta}G observed in our minimalistic system agrees very well with the position-dependent amino acid contribution of the biological hydrophobicity scale. Characteristic sampling times of ~2 s appear sufficient to reach a steady state for a ~20 amino acid-long segment invalidating the hypothesis of insufficient sampling.",

    "abstract": "Spatial structure within microbial communities can provide nearly limitless opportunities for social interactions and are an important driver for evolution. As metabolites are often molecular signals, metabolite diffusion within microbial communities can affect the composition and dynamics of the community in a manner that can be challenging to deconstruct. We used encapsulation of a synthetic microbial community within microdroplets to investigate the effects of spatial structure and metabolite diffusion on population dynamics and to examine the effects of cheating by one member of the community. The synthetic community was comprised of three strains: a  Producer that makes the diffusible quorum sensing molecule (N-(3-Oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, C12-oxo-HSL) or AHL; a  Receiver that is killed by AHL and a Non-Producer or  cheater that benefits from the extinction of the Receivers, but without the costs associated with the AHL synthesis. We demonstrate that despite rapid diffusion of AHL between microdroplets, the spatial structure imposed by the microdroplets allow a more efficient but transient enrichment of more rare and slower growing  Producer subpopulations. Eventually, the Non-Producer population drove the Producers to extinction. By including fluorescence-activated microdroplet sorting and providing sustained competition by the Receiver strain, we demonstrate a strategy for indirect enrichment of a rare and unlabeled Producer. The ability to screen and enrich metabolite Producers from a much larger population under conditions of rapid diffusion provides an important framework for the development of applications in synthetic ecology and biotechnology.\n\nAbstract Figure\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=124 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/523444v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@81dcd9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ca30f9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1553cc3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1085821_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Current approved vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have focused solely on the spike protein to provide immunity. The first vaccines were developed rapidly using spike mRNA delivered by lipid nanoparticles but required ultra-low storage and have had limited immunity against variations in spike. Subsequently, protein-based vaccines were developed which offer broader immunity but require significant time for development and use of an adjuvant to boost immune response. Here, exosomes were used to deliver a bi-valent protein-based vaccine, in which two independent viral proteins were used. Exosomes were engineered to express either SARS-CoV-2 Delta spike (Stealth X-Spike, STX-S) or the more conserved nucleocapsid (Stealth X-Nucleocapsid, STX-N) protein on the surface. When administered as single product (STX-S or STX-N) or in combination (STX-S+N), both STX-S and STX-N induced a strong immunization with the production of a potent humoral and cellular immune response. Interestingly, these results were obtained with administration of only nanograms of protein and without adjuvant. In two independent animal models (mouse and rabbit), administration of nanograms of the STX-S+N vaccine resulted in increased antibody production, potent neutralizing antibodies with cross-reactivity to other variants of spike and strong T-cell responses. Importantly, no competition in immune response was observed, allowing for delivery of nucleocapsid with spike to offer improved SARS-CoV-2 immunity. These data show that the StealthXTM exosome platform has an enormous potential to revolutionize vaccinology by combining the advantages of mRNA and recombinant protein vaccines into a superior, rapidly generated, low dose vaccine resulting in potent, broader immunity.",

    "abstract": "In vitro systems have provided great insight into the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. Yet, in vitro approaches cannot reflect the full complexity of what transpires within a host. As the mammalian gut is host to trillions of resident bacteria and thus a potential breeding ground for antibiotic resistance, we sought to better understand how gut bacteria respond to antibiotic treatment in vivo. Here, we colonized germ-free mice with a genetically barcoded antibiotic pan-susceptible Escherichia coli clinical isolate and then administered the antibiotic cefepime via programmable subcutaneous pumps which allowed for closer emulation of human parenteral antibiotic pharmacokinetics/dynamics. After seven days of antibiotics, we were unable to culture E. coli from feces. We were, however, able to recover barcoded E. coli from harvested gastrointestinal (GI) tissue, despite high GI tract and plasma cefepime concentrations. Strikingly, these E. coli isolates were not resistant to cefepime but had acquired mutations - most notably in the wbaP gene, which encodes an enzyme required for the initiation of the synthesis of the polysaccharide capsule and lipopolysaccharide O antigen - that increased their ability to invade and survive within intestinal cells, including cultured human colonocytes. Further, these E. coli mutants exhibited a persister phenotype when exposed to cefepime, allowing for greater survival to pulses of cefepime treatment when compared to the wildtype strain. Our findings highlight a mechanism by which bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract can adapt to antibiotic treatment by increasing their ability to persist during antibiotic treatment and invade intestinal epithelial cells where antibiotic concentrations are substantially reduced.",

    "abstract": "Glycerophospholipids including phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) are vital components of biological membranes. Trypanosomatid parasites of the genus Leishmania can acquire PE and PC via de novo synthesis and the uptake/remodeling of host lipids. In this study, we investigated the ethanolaminephosphate cytidyltransferase (EPCT) in Leishmania major, which is the causative agent for cutaneous leishmaniasis. EPCT is a key enzyme in the ethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway which is responsible for the de novo synthesis of PE. Our results demonstrate that L. major EPCT is a cytosolic protein capable of catalyzing the formation of CDP-ethanolamine from ethanolamine-phosphate and cytidine triphosphate. Genetic manipulation experiments indicate that EPCT is essential in both the promastigote and amastigote stages of L. major as the chromosomal null mutants cannot survive without the episomal expression of EPCT. This differs from our previous findings on the choline branch of the Kennedy pathway (responsible for PC synthesis) which is required only in promastigotes but not amastigotes. While episomal EPCT expression does not affect promastigote proliferation under normal conditions, it leads to reduced production of ethanolamine plasmalogen or plasmenylethanolamine, the dominant PE subtype in Leishmania. In addition, parasites with epsiomal EPCT exhibit heightened sensitivity to acidic pH and starvation stress, and significant reduction in virulence. In summary, our investigation demonstrates that proper regulation of EPCT expression is crucial for PE synthesis, stress response, and survival of Leishmania parasites throughout their life cycle.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIn nature, Leishmania parasites alternate between fast replicating, extracellular promastigotes in sand fly gut and slow growing, intracellular amastigotes in macrophages. Previous studies suggest that promastigotes acquire most of their lipids via de novo synthesis whereas amastigotes rely on the uptake and remodeling of host lipids. Here we investigated the function of ethanolaminephosphate cytidyltransferase (EPCT) which catalyzes a key step in the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in Leishmania major. Results showed that EPCT is indispensable for both promastigotes and amastigotes, indicating that de novo PE synthesis is still needed at certain capacity for the intracellular form of Leishmania parasites. In addition, elevated EPCT expression alters overall PE synthesis and compromises parasites tolerance to adverse conditions and is deleterious to the growth of intracellular amastigotes. These findings provide new insight into how Leishmania acquire essential phospholipids and how disturbance of lipid metabolism can impact parasite fitness.",

    "abstract": "A regimen comprised of bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid (BPaL) is the first oral 6-month regimen approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and recommended by the World Health Organization for treatment of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. We used a well-established BALB/c mouse model of tuberculosis to evaluate the treatment-shortening potential of replacing bedaquiline with either of two new, more potent diarylquinolines in early clinical trials, TBAJ-587 and TBAJ-876. We also evaluated the effect of replacing linezolid with a new oxazolidinone, TBI-223, exhibiting a larger safety margin with respect to mitochondrial toxicity in preclinical studies. Replacing bedaquiline with TBAJ-587 at the same 25 mg/kg dose significantly reduced the proportion of mice relapsing after 2 months of treatment, while replacing linezolid with TBI-223 at the same 100 mg/kg dose did not significantly change the proportion of mice relapsing. Replacing linezolid or TBI-223 with sutezolid in combination with TBAJ-587 and pretomanid significantly reduced the proportion of mice relapsing. In combination with pretomanid and TBI-223, TBAJ-876 at 6.25 mg/kg was equipotent to TBAJ-587 at 25 mg/kg. We conclude that replacement of bedaquiline with these more efficacious and potentially safer diarylquinolines and replacement of linezolid with potentially safer and at least as efficacious oxazolidinones in the clinically successful BPaL regimen may lead to superior regimens capable of treating both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB more effectively and safely.",

    "abstract": "The modification of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. is primarily controlled by the two-component system PmrAB. LPS modification allows bacteria to avoid killing by positively charged antibiotics like polymyxin B. We previously demonstrated that in uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), the sensor histidine kinase PmrB also activates a non-cognate transcription factor, QseB, and this activation somehow augments polymyxin B tolerance in UPEC. Here, we demonstrate - for the first time - that in the absence of the canonical LPS transcriptional regulator, PmrA, QseB can direct some modifications on the LPS. In agreement with this observation, transcriptional profiling analyses demonstrate regulatory overlaps between PmrA and QseB in terms of regulating LPS modification genes. However, both PmrA and QseB must be present for UPEC to mount robust tolerance to polymyxin B. Transcriptional and metabolomic analyses also reveal that QseB transcriptionally regulates the metabolism of glutamate and 2-oxoglutarate, which are consumed and produced during the modification of lipid A. We show that deletion of qseB alters glutamate levels in the bacterial cells. The qseB deletion mutant, which is susceptible to positively charged antibiotics, is rescued by exogenous addition of 2-oxoglutarate. These findings uncover a previously unknown mechanism of metabolic control of antibiotic tolerance that may be contributing to antibiotic treatment failure in the clinic.\n\nIMPORTANCEAlthough antibiotic prescriptions are guided by well-established susceptibility testing methods, antibiotic treatments oftentimes fail. The presented work is significant, because it uncovers a mechanism by which bacteria transiently avoid killing by antibiotics. This mechanism involves two closely related transcription factors, PmrA and QseB, which are conserved across Enterobacteriaceae. We demonstrate that PmrA and QseB share regulatory targets in lipid A modification pathway and prove that QseB can orchestrate modifications of lipid A in E. coli in the absence of PmrA. Finally, we show that QseB controls glutamate metabolism during the antibiotic response. These results suggest that rewiring of QseB-mediated metabolic genes can lead to stable antibiotic resistance in subpopulations within the host, thereby contributing to antibiotic treatment failure.",

    "abstract": "Apicomplexan parasites use Ca2+-regulated exocytosis to secrete essential virulence factors from specialized organelles called micronemes. Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are required for microneme exocytosis; however, the molecular events that regulate trafficking and fusion of micronemes with the plasma membrane remain unresolved. Here, we combine sub-minute resolution phosphoproteomics and bio-orthogonal labeling of kinase substrates in Toxoplasma gondii to identify 163 proteins phosphorylated in a CDPK1-dependent manner. In addition to known regulators of secretion, we identify uncharacterized targets with predicted functions across signaling, gene expression, trafficking, metabolism, and ion homeostasis. One of the CDPK1 targets is a putative HOOK activating adaptor. In other eukaryotes, HOOK homologs form the FHF complex with FTS and FHIP to activate dynein-mediated trafficking of endosomes along microtubules. We show the FHF complex is partially conserved in T. gondii, consisting of HOOK, an FTS homolog, and two parasite-specific proteins (TGGT1_306920 and TGGT1_316650). CDPK1 kinase activity and HOOK are required for the rapid apical trafficking of micronemes as parasites initiate motility. Moreover, parasites lacking HOOK or FTS display impaired microneme protein secretion, leading to a block in the invasion of host cells. Taken together, our work provides a comprehensive catalog of CDPK1 targets and reveals how vesicular trafficking has been tuned to support a parasitic lifestyle.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase-independent cancer proliferation via the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) relies upon two distinct, largely uncharacterized, break-induced-replication (BIR) processes. How cancer cells initiate and regulate these terminal repair mechanisms is unknown. Here, we establish that the EXD2 nuclease is recruited to ALT telomeres to direct their productive repair. We demonstrate that EXD2 loss leads to telomere shortening, elevated telomeric sister chromatid exchanges, C-circle formation as well as BIR-mediated telomeric replication. We discover that EXD2 fork-processing activity triggers a switch between RAD52-dependent and -independent ALT-associated BIR. The latter is suppressed by EXD2 but depends specifically on the fork remodeler SMARCAL1 and the MUS81 nuclease. Thus, our findings suggest that processing of stalled replication forks orchestrates elongation pathway choice at ALT telomeres. Finally, we show that co-depletion of EXD2 with BLM, DNA2 or POLD3 confers synthetic lethality in ALT cells, identifying EXD2 as a potential druggable target for ALT-reliant cancers.",

    "abstract": "The multistep PROTAC (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras) degradation process poses challenges for their rational development, as rate limiting steps determining PROTAC efficiency remain largely unknown. Moreover, the slow throughput of currently used endpoint assays does not allow the comprehensive analysis of larger series of PROTACs. Here we developed cell-based assays using NanoLuciferase and HaloTags, that allow measuring PROTAC induced degradation and ternary complex formation kinetics and stability in cells. Using PROTACs developed for degradation of WDR5, the characterization of the mode of action of these PROTACs in the early degradation cascade revealed a key role of ternary complex formation and stability. Comparing a series of ternary complex crystal structures highlighted the importance of an efficient E3-target interface for ternary complex stability. The developed assays outline a strategy for the rational optimization of PROTACs using a series of live cell assays monitoring key steps of the early PROTAC induced degradation pathway.\n\nSignificanceThe multistep PROTAC induced degradation process of a POI poses a significant challenge for the rational design of these bifunctional small molecules as critical steps that limit PROTAC efficacy cannot be easily assayed at required throughput. In addition, the cellular location of the POI may pose additional challenges as some cellular compartments, such as the nucleus, may not be easily reached by PROTAC molecules and the targeted E3 ligases may not be present in this cellular compartment. We propose therefore a comprehensive assay panel for PROTACs evaluation in cellular environments using a sensor system that allows continuous monitoring of the protein levels of the endogenous POI. We developed a cell line expressing WDR5 from its endogenous locus in fusion with a small sequence tag (HiBIT) that can be reconstituted to functional NanoLuciferase (NLuc). This system allowed continuous monitoring of endogenous WDR5 levels in cells and together with HaloTag system also the continuous monitoring of ternary complex (E3, WDR5 and PROTAC) formation. As this assay can be run at high throughput, we used this versatile system monitoring three diverse chemical series of WDR5 PROTACs that markedly differ in their degradation properties. Monitoring cell penetration, binary complex formation (PROTAC-WDR5 and PROTAC-VHL) as well as ternary complex formation we found that PROTAC efficiency highly correlated with synergy of ternary complex formation in cells. This study represents a first data set on diverse PROTACs studying this property in cellulo and it outlines a strategy for the rational optimization of PROTACs. It also provided kinetic data on ternary complex assembly and dissociation that may serve as a benchmark for future studies utilizing also kinetic properties for PROTAC development. Comparative structural studies revealed larger PROTAC mediated interaction surfaces for PROTACs that efficiently formed ternary complexes highlighting the utility of structure based optimization of PROTAC induced ternary complexes in the development process.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) is a widely used tool for quantifying gene expression and determining the location of RNA molecules in cells. Here, we present an improved method for FISH probe production that yields high purity probes with a wide range of fluorophores using standard laboratory equipment at low cost. The method modifies an earlier protocol that uses terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase to add fluorescently labeled nucleotides to synthetic deoxyoligonucleotides. In our protocol, Amino-11-ddUTP is joined to an oligonucleotide pool prior to its conjugation to a fluorescent dye, thereby generating pools of probes ready for a variety of modifications. This order of reaction steps allows for high labeling efficiencies regardless of the GC content or terminal base of the oligonucleotides. The Degree Of Labeling (DOL) for spectrally distinct fluorophores (Quasar, ATTO and Alexa dyes) was mostly greater than 90%, comparable to commercial probes. The ease and low cost of production allowed generation of probe-sets targeting a wide variety of RNA molecules. Using these probes, FISH assays in C2C12 cells showed the expected subcellular localization of mRNAs and pre-mRNAs for Polr2a (RNA polymerase II subunit 2a) and Gapdh, and of the long noncoding RNAs Malat1 and Neat1. Developing FISH probe sets for several transcripts containing retained introns, we found that retained introns in the Gabbr1 and Noc2l transcripts are present in subnuclear foci separate from their sites of synthesis and partially coincident with nuclear speckles. This labeling protocol should have many applications in RNA biology.",

    "abstract": "Recycling of parental histones is an important step in epigenetic inheritance. During DNA replication, DNA polymerase epsilon subunit DPB3/DPB4 and DNA replication helicase subunit MCM2 are involved in the transfer of parental histones to the leading and lagging DNA strands, respectively. Single Dpb3 deletion (dpb3{Delta}) or Mcm2 mutation (mcm2-3A), which each disrupt one parental histone transfer pathway, leads to the others predominance. However, the impact of the two histone transfer pathways on chromatin structure and DNA repair remains elusive. In this study, we used budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to determine the genetic and epigenetic outcomes from disruption of parental histone H3-H4 tetramer transfer. We found that a dpb3{Delta}/mcm2-3A double mutant did not exhibit the single dpb3{Delta} and mcm2-3A mutants asymmetric parental histone patterns, suggesting that the processes by which parental histones are transferred to the leading and lagging strands are independent. Surprisingly, the frequency of homologous recombination was significantly lower in dpb3{Delta}, mcm2-3A, and dpb3{Delta}/mcm2-3A mutants relative to the wild-type strain, likely due to the elevated levels of free histones detected in the mutant cells. Together, these findings indicate that proper transfer of parental histones to the leading and lagging strands during DNA replication is essential for maintaining chromatin structure and that high levels of free histones due to parental histone transfer defects are detrimental to cells.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic mechanisms govern developmental cell fate decisions, but how DNA methylation coordinates with chromatin structure and three-dimensional DNA folding to enact cell-type specific gene expression programmes remains poorly understood. Here, we use mouse embryonic stem and epiblast-like cells deficient for 5-methyl cytosine or its oxidative derivatives (5-hydroxy-, 5-formyl- and 5-carboxy-cytosine) to dissect the gene regulatory mechanisms that control cell lineage specification at the exit of pluripotency. Genetic ablation of either DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) or Ten-eleven-translocation (Tet) activity yielded largely distinct sets of dysregulated genes, revealing divergent transcriptional defects upon perturbation of individual branches of the DNA cytosine methylation cycle. Unexpectedly, we found that disrupting DNA methylation or oxidation interferes with key enhancer features, including chromatin accessibility, enhancer-characteristic histone modifications, and long-range chromatin interactions with putative target genes. In addition to affecting transcription of select genes in pluripotent stem cells, we observe impaired enhancer priming, including a loss of three-dimensional interactions, at regulatory elements associated with key lineage-specifying genes that are required later in development, as we demonstrate for the key hematopoietic genes Klf1 and Lyl1. Consistently, we observe impaired transcriptional activation of blood genes during embryoid body differentiation of knockout cells.

    "abstract": "Hsp90 is an essential molecular chaperone responsible for the folding and activation of hundreds of  client proteins, including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)1-3. Previously, we revealed that GR ligand binding activity is inhibited by Hsp70 and restored by Hsp90, aided by co-chaperones4. We then presented cryo-EM structures mechanistically detailing how Hsp70 and Hsp90 remodel the conformation of GR to regulate ligand binding5,6. In vivo, GR-chaperone complexes are found associated with numerous Hsp90 co-chaperones, but the most enigmatic have been the immunophilins FKBP51 and FKBP52, which further regulate the activity of GR and other steroid receptors7-9. A molecular understanding of how FKBP51 and FKBP52 integrate with the GR chaperone cycle to differentially regulate GR activation in vivo is lacking due to difficulties reconstituting these interactions. Here, we present a 3.01 [A] cryo-EM structure of the GR:Hsp90:FKBP52 complex, revealing, for the first time, that FKBP52 directly binds to the folded, ligand-bound GR using three novel interfaces, each of which we demonstrate are critical for FKBP52-dependent potentiation of GR activity in vivo. In addition, we present a 3.23 [A] cryo-EM structure of the GR:Hsp90:FKBP51 complex, which, surprisingly, largely mimics the GR:Hsp90:FKBP52 structure. In both structures, FKBP51 and FKBP52 directly engage the folded GR and unexpectedly facilitate release of p23 through an allosteric mechanism. We also reveal that FKBP52, but not FKBP51, potentiates GR ligand binding in vitro, in a manner dependent on FKBP52-specific interactions. Altogether, we reveal how FKBP51 and FKBP52 integrate into the GR chaperone cycle to advance GR to the next stage of maturation and how FKBP51 and FKBP52 compete for GR:Hsp90 binding, leading to functional antagonism.",

We have previously identified a new botulinum neurotoxin serotype, BoNT/X, that has unique and therapeutically attractive properties. We present the cryo-EM structure of the BoNT/X-NTNH/X complex at 3.1 [A] resolution. Unexpectedly, the BoNT/X complex is stable and protease resistant at both neutral and acidic pH and disassembles only in alkaline conditions. Using the stabilizing effect of NTNH, we isolated BoNT/X and showed that it has very low potency both in vitro and in vivo. Given the high catalytic activity and translocation efficacy of BoNT/X, low activity of the full toxin is likely due to the receptor-binding domain, which presents weak ganglioside binding and exposed hydrophobic surfaces.",

Here, we report that mouse REC114 forms homodimers, that it associates with MEI4 as a 2:1 heterotrimer that further dimerizes, and that IHO1 forms coiled-coil based tetramers. Using AlphaFold2 modelling combined with biochemical characterization we uncovered the molecular details of these assemblies. Finally, we show that IHO1 directly interacts with the PH domain of REC114 by recognizing the same surface as TOPOVIBL and another meiotic factor ANKRD31.

    "abstract": "The proteolytic active sites of the 26S proteasome are sequestered within the catalytic chamber of its 20S core particle (CP). Access to this chamber is through a narrow channel defined by the outer  subunits. Free 20S CP is found in a latent state in which the N-termini of neighboring  subunits form a gate blocking access to the channel. Entry of substrates can be facilitated by the attachment of the activators or regulatory particles, which can rearrange the blocking  subunit N-terminal residues. In order to determine the specific physiological role of individual elements working in concert within the gate, we constructed a set of truncations or single-site mutations in each of the participating  N-terminal tails. We report herein that whereas only a few N-termini are important for maintaining a closed gate, all seven N-termini participate in the open gate. Specifically, an invariant tyrosine (Y) in each subunit forms a hydrogen bond with a conserved aspartate (D) in the N-terminal tail of its counterclockwise neighbor, with the exception of the 1-2 pair leaving a gap in the ring circumference. A third residue (X) of this YD(X) motif aligns the open channel; specifically, the phenylalanine (F) at this position of the 2 subunit comes in direct contact with the translocating substrate. Consequently, deletion of this 2 N-terminal tail slows down proteolysis despite the appearance of an open gate state. We conclude that the YD(X) motif in N-terminal tail of  subunits plays an important role in gating the proteasome and in processing the substrate.",

We have replaced T7s DNA polymerase with a transcription factor controlled by a theophylline riboswitch and have created two types of host environments to propagate the engineered phage. Both types host an error-prone T7 DNA polymerase regulated by a T7 promoter along with another critical gene - either cmk or pifA, depending on the host type. The cmk gene is necessary for T7 replication and is used in the first host type for selection in the riboswitchs ON state. Conversely, the second host type incorporates the pifA gene, leading to abortive T7 infections and used for selection in the riboswitchs OFF state. This dual-selection system, termed T7AE, was then applied to a library of 65,536 engineered T7 phages, each carrying randomized riboswitch variants. Through successive passage in both host types with and without theophylline, we observed an enrichment of phages encoding functional riboswitches that conferred a fitness advantage to the phage in both hosts. The T7AE technique thereby opens new pathways for the evolution and advancement of gene switches, including non-coding RNA-based switches, setting the stage for significant strides in synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "Fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane results in the secretion of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), or exosomes. The sorting of one exosomal cargo RNA, miR223, is facilitated by the RNA-binding protein, YBX1 (Shurtleff et al., 2016). We found that miR223 specifically binds a \"cold shock\" domain (CSD) of YBX1 through a 5 proximal sequence motif UCAGU that may represent a binding site or structural feature required for sorting. Prior to sorting into exosomes, most of the cytoplasmic miR223 resides in mitochondria. An RNA-binding protein localized to the mitochondrial matrix, YBAP1, appears to serve as a negative regulator of miR223 enrichment into exosomes. miR223 levels decreased in the mitochondria and increased in exosomes after loss of YBAP1. We observed YBX1 shuttle between mitochondria and endosomes in live cells. YBX1 also partitions into P body granules in the cytoplasm (Liu et al., 2021). We propose a model in which miR223 and likely other miRNAs are stored in mitochondria and are then mobilized by YBX1 to cytoplasmic phase condensate granules for capture into invaginations in the endosome that give rise to exosomes.",

    "abstract": "Feline Coronaviruses (FCoVs) commonly cause mild enteric infections in felines worldwide (termed Feline Enteric Coronavirus [FECV]), with around 12% developing into deadly Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP; Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus [FIPV]). Genomic differences between FECV and FIPV have been reported, yet the putative genotypic basis of the highly pathogenic phenotype remains unclear. Here, we used state-of-the-art molecular evolutionary genetic statistical techniques to identify and compare differences in natural selection pressure between FECV and FIPV sequences, as well as to identify FIPV and FECV specific signals of positive selection. We analyzed full length FCoV protein coding genes thought to contain mutations associated with FIPV (Spike, ORF3abc, and ORF7ab). We identified two sites exhibiting differences in natural selection pressure between FECV and FIPV: one within the S1/S2 furin cleavage site, and the other within the fusion domain of Spike. We also found 15 sites subject to positive selection associated with FIPV within Spike, 11 of which have not previously been suggested as possibly relevant to FIP development. These sites fall within Spike protein subdomains that participate in host cell receptor interaction, immune evasion, tropism shifts, host cellular entry, and viral escape. There were 14 sites (12 novel) within Spike under positive selection associated with the FECV phenotype, almost exclusively within the S1/S2 furin cleavage site and adjacent C domain, along with a signal of relaxed selection in FIPV relative to FECV, suggesting that furin cleavage functionality may not be needed for FIPV. Positive selection inferred in ORF7b was associated with the FECV phenotype, and included 24 positively selected sites, while ORF7b had signals of relaxed selection in FIPV. We found evidence of positive selection in ORF3c in FCoV wide analyses, but no specific association with the FIPV or FECV phenotype. We hypothesize that some combination of mutations in FECV may contribute to FIP development, and that is unlikely to be one singular \"switch\" mutational event. This work expands our understanding of the complexities of FIP development and provides insights into how evolutionary forces may alter pathogenesis in coronavirus genomes.",

    "abstract": "The major barrier to an HIV cure is the persistence of infected cells that evade host immune surveillance despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Most prior host genetic HIV studies have focused on identifying DNA polymorphisms (e.g., CCR5{Delta}32, MHC class I alleles) associated with viral load among untreated \"elite controllers\" (~1% of HIV+ individuals who are able to control virus without ART). However, there have been few studies evaluating host genetic predictors of viral control for the majority of people living with HIV (PLWH) on ART. We performed host RNA sequencing and HIV reservoir quantification (total DNA, unspliced RNA, intact DNA) from peripheral CD4+ T cells from 191 HIV+ ART-suppressed non-controllers. Multivariate models included covariates for timing of ART initiation, nadir CD4+ count, age, sex, and ancestry. Lower HIV total DNA (an estimate of the total reservoir) was associated with upregulation of tumor suppressor genes NBL1 (q=0.012) and P3H3 (q=0.012). Higher HIV unspliced RNA (an estimate of residual HIV transcription) was associated with downregulation of several host genes involving inflammasome (IL1A, CSF3, TNFAIP5, TNFAIP6, TNFAIP9, CXCL3, CXCL10) and innate immune (TLR7) signaling, as well as novel associations with potassium (KCNJ2) and gap junction (GJB2) channels, all q<0.05. Gene set enrichment analyses identified significant associations with TLR4/microbial translocation (q=0.006), IL-1{beta}/NRLP3 inflammasome (q=0.008), and IL-10 (q=0.037) signaling. HIV intact DNA (an estimate of the \"replication-competent\" reservoir) demonstrated trends with thrombin degradation (PLGLB1) and glucose metabolism (AGL) genes, but data were (HIV intact DNA detected in only 42% of participants). Our findings demonstrate that among treated PLWH, that inflammation, innate immune responses, bacterial translocation, and tumor suppression/cell proliferation host signaling play a key role in the maintenance of the HIV reservoir during ART. Further data are needed to validate these findings, including functional genomic studies, and expanded epidemiologic studies in female, non-European cohorts.\n\nAuthor SummaryAlthough lifelong HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses virus, the major barrier to an HIV cure is the persistence of infected cells that evade host immune surveillance despite effective ART, \"the HIV reservoir.\" HIV eradication strategies have focused on eliminating residual virus to allow for HIV remission, but HIV cure trials to date have thus far failed to show a clinically meaningful reduction in the HIV reservoir. There is an urgent need for a better understanding of the host-viral dynamics during ART suppression to identify potential novel therapeutic targets for HIV cure. This is the first epidemiologic host gene expression study to demonstrate a significant link between HIV reservoir size and several well-known immunologic pathways (e.g., IL-1{beta}, TLR7, TNF- signaling pathways), as well as novel associations with potassium and gap junction channels (Kir2.1, connexin 26). Further data are needed to validate these findings, including functional genomic studies and expanded epidemiologic studies in female, non-European cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Captivity can alter the stress physiology and behaviour of an animal in both the short- and long-term through repetitive exposure to novel stressors and, subsequently, may reduce the success of conservation efforts such as translocation and reintroduction. The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is threatened with extinction from a fatal facial tumour disease which has led to the establishment of an insurance meta-population designed for future reintroductions of disease-free devils. The meta-population is comprised of intensive captive and free-range captive environments; however, no study has yet examined the long-term physiological implications of captivity on devils. We used non-invasive faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) monitoring to determine if there were any differences in adrenal activity between intensive captive, free-range captive, and wild devils. FGMs were not age- or sexdependent, and we found that all population-types had similar intra-population variability and mean FGMs. In conclusion, both types of captive environment maintain stress profiles similar to wild devils.",

Our \"CasPlus\" editing platform significantly increases the proportion of precise 1- to 3-base-pair insertions at target sites.

    "abstract": "The identification of cell type-specific genes and their modification under different conditions is central to our understanding of human health and disease. The stomach, a hollow organ in the upper gastrointestinal tract, provides an acidic environment that contributes to microbial defence and facilitates the activity of secreted digestive enzymes to process food and nutrients into chyme. In contrast to other sections of the gastrointestinal tract, detailed descriptions of cell type gene enrichment profiles in the stomach are absent from the major single cell sequencing-based atlases. Here, we use an integrative correlation analysis method to predict human stomach cell type transcriptome signatures using unfractionated stomach RNAseq data from 359 individuals. We profile parietal, chief, gastric mucous, gastric enteroendocrine, mitotic, endothelial, fibroblast, macrophage, neutrophil, T-cell and plasma cells, identifying over 1600 cell type-enriched genes. We uncover the cell type expression profile of several non-coding genes strongly associated with the progression of gastric cancer and, using a sex-based subset analysis, uncover a panel of male-only chief cell-enriched genes. This study provides a roadmap to further understand human stomach biology.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal activity is an energy-intensive process that is largely sustained by instantaneous fuel utilization and ATP synthesis. However, how neurons couple ATP synthesis rate to fuel availability is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the metabolic sensor enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase regulates neuronal activity-driven mitochondrial bioenergetics. We show that neuronal activity upregulates O-GlcNAcylation mainly in mitochondria. Mitochondrial O-GlcNAcylation is promoted by activity-driven fuel consumption, which allows neurons to compensate for high energy expenditure based on fuel availability. To determine the proteins that are responsible for these adjustments, we mapped the mitochondrial O-GlcNAcome of neurons. Finally, we determine that neurons fail to meet activity-driven metabolic demand when O-GlcNAcylation dynamics are prevented. Our findings suggest that O-GlcNAcylation provides a fuel-dependent feedforward control mechanism in neurons to optimize mitochondrial performance based on neuronal activity. This mechanism thereby couples neuronal metabolism to mitochondrial bioenergetics and plays a key role in sustaining energy homeostasis.",

However, this appears in contrast with the non-overlapping patterns of Wnt target gene expression in several contexts, including early mammalian embryogenesis. Here we followed Wnt target gene expression in human embryonic stem cells after Wnt pathway stimulation at a single-cell resolution. Cells changed gene expression program over time consistent with three key developmental events: i) loss of pluripotency, ii) induction of Wnt target genes, and iii) mesoderm specification. Contrary to our expectation, not all cells displayed equal amplitude of Wnt target gene activation; rather, they distributed in a continuum from strong to weak responders when ranked based on the expression of the target AXIN2. Moreover, high AXIN2 did not always correspond to elevated expression of other Wnt targets, which were activated in different proportions in individual cells. This uncoupling of Wnt target gene expression, which was also identified in single colorectal cancer cells with hyper-activated Wnt signaling, underlines the necessity to identify additional mechanisms that explain the heterogeneity of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin-mediated transcriptional outputs in single cells.",

Their use for communication among conspecifics has long been speculated, but not conclusively established so far. In this study we categorize dolphins click productions into types on the basis of their amplitude contour and analyze the distribution of individual clicks and click sequences against their duration and length. We demonstrate that the repertoire and composition of clicks and click sequences follow three key linguistic laws of efficient communication, namely, Zipfs rank-frequency law, the law of brevity and Menzerath-Altmann law. Conforming to the rank-frequency law suggests that clicks may form a linguistic code that is subject to selective pressures for unification, on the one hand, and diversification, on the other. Conforming to the other two laws also implies that dolphins use clicks in accord with the compression criterion, or minimization of code length without loss of information. Our results furnish novel evidence for conformity to the linguistic laws in this type of dolphins signal and in the realm of animal vocalizations more generally.",
