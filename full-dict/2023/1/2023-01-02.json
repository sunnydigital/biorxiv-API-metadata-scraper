    "abstract": "Recessive mutations in the TRIO gene are associated with intellectual deficiency (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and developmental epileptic encephalopathies (DEE). TRIO is a dual guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA. Trio has been extensively studied in excitatory neurons, and has recently been found to regulate the switch from tangential to radial migration in GABAergic interneurons (INs), through GEFD1-Rac1-dependent SDF1/CXCR4 signalling. Given the central role of Rho-GTPases during neuronal migration and the implication of IN pathologies in ASD and DEE, we investigated the relative roles of both Trios GEF domains in regulating the dynamics of INs tangential migration. In Trio-/- mice, we observed reduced numbers of tangentially migrating INs, with intact progenitor proliferation. Further, we noted increased growth cone collapse in developing INs, suggesting altered cytoskeleton dynamics. To bypass the embryonic mortality of Trio-/- mice, we generated Dlx5/6Cre;Trioc/c conditional mutant mice, which develop spontaneous seizures and behavioral deficits reminiscent of ASD and ID. These phenotypes are associated with reduced cortical IN density and functional cortical inhibition. Mechanistically, this reduction of cortical IN numbers reflects a premature switch to radial migration, with an aberrant early entry in the cortical plate, as well as major deficits in cytoskeletal dynamics, including enhanced leading neurite branching and slower nucleokinesis reflecting reduced actin filament condensation and turnover. Further, we show that both Trio GEFD1 and GEFD2 domains are required for proper IN migration, with a dominant role of the RhoA-activating GEFD2 domain. Altogether, our data show a critical role of the DEE/ASD-associated Trio gene in the establishment of cortical inhibition and the requirement of both GEF domains in regulating IN migration dynamics.",

    "abstract": "A core problem in visual object learning is using a finite number of images of a new object to accurately identify that object in future, novel images. One longstanding, conceptual hypothesis asserts that this core problem is solved by adult brains through two connected mechanisms: 1) the re-representation of incoming retinal images as points in a fixed, multidimensional neural space, and 2) the optimization of linear decision boundaries in that space, via simple plasticity rules applied to a single downstream layer. Though this scheme is biologically plausible, the extent to which it explains learning behavior in humans has been unclear - in part because of a historical lack of image-computable models of the putative neural space, and in part because of a lack of measurements of human learning behaviors in difficult, naturalistic settings. Here, we addressed these gaps by 1) drawing from contemporary, image-computable models of the primate ventral visual stream to create a large set of testable learning models (n=2,408 models), and 2) using online psychophysics to measure human learning trajectories over a varied set of tasks involving novel 3D objects (n=371,000 trials), which we then used to develop (and publicly release) empirical benchmarks for comparing learning models to humans. We evaluated each learning model on these benchmarks, and found that learning models that using specific, high-level contemporary representations are surprisingly aligned with human behavior. While no tested model explained the entirety of replicable human behavior, these results establish that rudimentary plasticity rules, when combined with appropriate visual representations, have high explanatory power in predicting human behavior with respect to this core object learning problem.\n\nAuthor SummaryA basic conceptual hypothesis for how an adult brain learns to visually identify a new object is: 1) it re-represents images as points in a fixed, multidimensional space, then 2) it learns linear decision boundaries that separate images of a new object from others, using a single layer of plasticity. This hypothesis is considered biologically plausible, but gauging its power to explain human learning behavior has not been straightforward. In part, this is because it is difficult to model how brains re-represent images during object learning. However, ongoing efforts in neuroscience have led to the identification of specific, image-computable models that are at least partially accurate descriptions of the neural representations involved in primate vision. Here, we asked whether any of those representations, when combined them with simple plasticity rules, could make accurate predictions over a large body of human object learning behavioral measurements. We found that specific models could indeed explain a majority of our behavioral measurements, suggesting the rudimentary, biologically-plausible mechanisms considered here may be sufficient to explain a core aspect of human object learning.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria, apart from being the powerhouses of our cells, are key players in cellular metabolism and homeostasis. As a consequence, the core bioenergetics and metabolism of mitochondria are well studied considering the role that dysregulated mitochondrial metabolism plays in disease. Flux Balance Analysis, used in conjunction with metabolic model reconstructions is a powerful computational tool that predicts metabolism. The resulting quantitative descriptions of metabolic dysregulation not only allows current hypotheses to be tested in silico, but can also lead to novel model driven hypotheses that can be experimentally verified. Several metabolic reconstructions for human and mouse metabolism exist, but no model specific to mouse mitochondrial metabolism exists. Here, we have created a mouse-specific mitochondrial metabolic model, mitoMouse, which is based on the high-quality human MitoCore mode. MitoMouse contains 390 genes and 445 metabolites involved in 560 unique reactions, is able to model central carbon metabolism and has been extended to contain reduction of the CoQ complex of Oxidative Phosphorylation by the enzyme DHODH. MitoMOuse was validated to accurately model the important metabolic switch involving CoQ reduction resulting from increased malate import, as recently shown in mouse cardiac tissue. We expect this model to be of immense interest and relevance to researchers working on murine mitochondrial metabolism.",

    "abstract": "A key driver of mammalian intelligence is the ability to represent incoming sensory information across multiple abstraction levels. For example, in the visual ventral stream, incoming signals are first represented as low-level edge filters and then transformed into high-level object representations. These same hierarchical structures routinely emerge in artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained for image/object recognition tasks, suggesting that a similar process might underlie biological neural networks. However, the classical ANN training algorithm, backpropagation, is considered biologically implausible, and thus several alternative biologically plausible methods have been developed. For instance, several cortical-inspired ANNs in which the apical dendrite of a pyramidal neuron encodes top-down prediction signals have been proposed. In this case, akin to theories of predictive coding, a prediction error can be calculated locally inside each neuron for updating its incoming weights. Notwithstanding, from a neuroscience perspective, it is unclear whether neurons could compare their apical vs. somatic spiking activities to compute prediction errors. Here, we propose a solution to this problem by adapting the framework of the apical-somatic prediction error to the temporal domain. In particular, we show that if the apical feedback signal changes the postsynaptic firing rate, we can use differential Hebbian updates, a rate-based version of the classical spiking time-dependent plasticity (STDP) updates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a cortical-like deep ANN has been trained using such time-based learning rules. Overall, our work removes a key requirement of biologically plausible models for deep learning that does not align with plasticity rules observed in biology and proposes a learning mechanism that would explain how the timing of neuronal activity can allow supervised hierarchical learning.",

    "abstract": "We can all agree that a good story engages us, however, agreeing which story is good is far more debatable. In this study, we explored whether engagement with a narrative synchronizes listeners brain responses, by examining individual differences in engagement to the same story. To do so, we pre-registered and re-analyzed a previously collected dataset by Chang et al. (2021) of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans of 25 participants who listened to a one-hour story and answered questionnaires. We assessed the degree of their overall engagement with the story and their engagement with the main characters. The questionnaires revealed individual differences in engagement with the story, as well as different valence towards specific characters. Neuroimaging data showed that the auditory cortex, the default mode network (DMN) and language regions were involved in processing the story. Increased engagement with the story was correlated with increased neural synchronization within regions in the DMN (especially the medial prefrontal cortex), as well as regions outside the DMN such as the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex and the reward system. Interestingly, positively and negatively engaging characters elicited different patterns of neural synchronization. Finally, engagement increased functional connectivity within and between the DMN, the dorsal attention network and the control network. Taken together, these findings suggest that engagement with a narrative synchronizes listeners responses in regions involved in mentalizing, reward, working memory and attention. By examining individual differences in engagement, we revealed that these synchronization patterns are due to engagement, and not due to differences in the narratives content.",

    "abstract": "The intrinsic organization of functional brain networks is known to change with age, and is affected by perceptual input and task conditions. Here, we compare functional activity and connectivity during music listening and rest between younger (N=24) and older (N=24) adults, using whole brain regression, seed-based connectivity, and ROI-ROI connectivity analyses. As expected, activity and connectivity of auditory and reward networks scaled with liking during music listening in both groups. Younger adults show higher within-network connectivity of auditory and reward regions as compared to older adults, both at rest and during music listening, but this age-related difference at rest was reduced during music listening, especially in individuals who self-report high musical reward. Furthermore, younger adults showed higher functional connectivity between auditory network and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that was specific to music listening, whereas older adults showed a more globally diffuse pattern of connectivity, including higher connectivity between auditory regions and bilateral lingual and inferior frontal gyri. Finally, connectivity between auditory and reward regions was higher when listening to music selected by the participant. These results highlight the roles of aging and reward sensitivity on auditory and reward networks. Results may inform the design of music- based interventions for older adults, and improve our understanding of functional network dynamics of the brain at rest and during a cognitively engaging task.",

    "abstract": "In daily life, prehension is typically not the end goal of hand-object interactions but a precursor for manipulation. Nevertheless, functional MRI (fMRI) studies investigating manual manipulation have primarily relied on prehension as the end goal of an action. Here, we used slow event-related fMRI to investigate differences in neural activation patterns between prehension in isolation and prehension for object manipulation. Sixteen participants were instructed either to simply grasp the handle of a rotatable dial (isolated prehension) or to grasp and turn it (prehension for object manipulation). We used representational similarity analysis to investigate whether the experimental conditions could be discriminated from each other based on differences in task-related brain activation patterns. We also used temporal multivoxel pattern analysis to examine the evolution of regional activation patterns over time. Importantly, we were able to differentiate isolated prehension and prehension for manipulation from activation patterns in the early visual cortex, the caudal intraparietal sulcus, and the superior parietal lobule. Our findings indicate that object manipulation extends beyond the putative cortical grasping network (anterior intraparietal sulcus, premotor and motor cortices) to include the superior parietal lobule and early visual cortex.\n\nSignificance statementA simple act such as turning an oven dial requires not only that the central nervous system encode the initial state (starting dial orientation) of the object but also the appropriate posture to grasp it in order to achieve the desired end state (final dial orientation) and the motor commands to achieve that state. Using advanced temporal neuroimaging analysis techniques, we reveal how such actions unfold over time and how they differ between object manipulation (turning a dial) vs. grasping alone. We find that a combination of brain areas implicated in visual processing and sensorimotor integration can distinguish between the complex and simple tasks during planning, with neural patterns that approximate those during the actual execution of the action.",
