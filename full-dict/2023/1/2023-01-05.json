    "abstract": "The functionality of essential metabolic processes in chloroplasts depends on a balanced integration of nuclear-and chloroplast-encoded polypeptides into the plastids proteome. The chloroplast chaperonin machinery is an essential player in chloroplast protein folding with a more intricate structure and subunit composition compared to the orthologous GroEL/ES chaperonin of Escherichia coli. However, its exact role in chloroplasts remains obscure, mainly because of a very limited knowledge about the folded substrates. We employed the competition immunoprecipitation method for the identification of the chaperonins substrates in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Co-immunoprecipitation of the target complex in the presence of increasing amounts of isotope-labelled competitor epitope and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis specifically allowed to distinguish true interactors from unspecifically co-precipitated proteins. Besides known substrates such as RbcL, we revealed numerous new substrates with high confidence. Identified substrate proteins differ from bulk chloroplast proteins by a higher content of beta-sheets, lower alpha-helical content and increased aggregation propensity. Immunoprecipitations performed with a subunit of the co-chaperonin lid revealed the ClpP protease as a specific partner complex, with altered interactions during heat stress, pointing to a close collaboration of these machineries to maintain protein homeostasis in the chloroplast.",

    "abstract": "Degradation of most yeast mRNAs involves decapping by Dcp1/Dcp2. DEAD-box protein Dhh1 has been implicated as an activator of decapping, in coupling codon non-optimality to enhanced degradation, and as a translational repressor, but its functions in cells are incompletely understood. RNA-Seq analyses coupled with CAGE sequencing of all capped mRNAs revealed increased abundance of hundreds of mRNAs in dcp2{Delta} cells that appears to result directly from impaired decapping rather than elevated transcription, which was confirmed by ChIP-Seq analysis of RNA Polymerase II occupancies genome-wide. Interestingly, only a subset of mRNAs requires Dhh1 for targeting by Dcp2, and also generally requires the other decapping activators Pat1, Lsm2, Edc3 or Scd6; whereas most of the remaining transcripts utilize NMD factors for Dcp2-mediated turnover. Neither inefficient translation initiation nor stalled elongation appears to be a major driver of Dhh1-enhanced mRNA degradation. Surprisingly, ribosome profiling revealed that dcp2{Delta} confers widespread changes in relative TEs that generally favor well-translated mRNAs. Because ribosome biogenesis is reduced while capped mRNA abundance is increased by dcp2{Delta}, we propose that an increased ratio of mRNA to ribosomes increases competition among mRNAs for limiting ribosomes to favor efficiently translated mRNAs in dcp2{Delta} cells. Interestingly, genes involved in respiration or utilization of alternative carbon or nitrogen sources are derepressed, and both mitochondrial function and cell filamentation (a strategy for nutrient foraging) are elevated by dcp2{Delta}, suggesting that mRNA decapping sculpts gene expression post-transcriptionally to fine-tune metabolic pathways and morphological transitions according to nutrient availability.",
