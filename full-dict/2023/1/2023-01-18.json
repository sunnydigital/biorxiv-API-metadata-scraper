    "abstract": "This paper, for the first time, compares the behaviors of nonlinear versus linear muscle networks in decoding hidden peripheral synergistic neural patterns during dynamic functional tasks. In this paper, we report a case study during which one healthy subject conducts a series of four lower limb repetitive tasks. Specifically, the paper focuses on tasks that involve the right knee joint, including walking, sit-tostand, stepping, and drop-jump. Twelve muscles were recorded using the Delsys Trigno system. The linear muscle network was generated using coherence analysis, and the nonlinear network was generated using Spearmans correlation. The results show that the degree, clustering coefficient, and global efficiency of the muscle network have the highest value among tasks in the linear domain for the walking task, while a low linear synergistic network behavior for the sit-to-stand is observed. On the other hand, the results show that the nonlinear functional muscle network decodes high connectivity (degree) and clustering coefficient and efficiency for the sit-tostand when compared with other tasks. We have also developed a two-dimensional functional connectivity plane composed of linear and nonlinear features and shown that it can span the lower-limb dynamic task space. The results of this paper for the first time highlight the importance of observing both linear and nonlinear connectivity patterns, especially for complex dynamic tasks. It should also be noted that through a simultaneous EEG recording (using BrainVision System), we have shown that, indeed, cortical activity may indirectly explain highly-connected nonlinear muscle network for the sit-to-stand task, highlighting the importance of nonlinear muscle network as a neurophysiological window of observation beyond the periphery.",

    "abstract": "Single-Cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology measures the expression of thousands of genes at the cellular level. Analyzing single cell transcriptome allows the identification of heterogeneous cell groups, cellular-level regulations, and the trajectory of cell development. An important aspect in the analyses of scRNA-seq data is the clustering of cells, which is hampered by issues such as high dimensionality, cell type imbalance, redundancy, and dropout. Given cells of each type are functionally consistent, incorporating biological relations between genes may improve the clustering results. Here, we develop a deep embedded clustering method, G3DC, that incorporates a graph loss based on existing gene network, together with a reconstruction loss to achieve both discriminative and informative embedding. The involvement of the gene network strengthens clustering performance, while helping the selection of functionally coherent genes that contribute to the clustering results. In addition, this method is well adapted to the sparse and zero-inflated scRNA-seq data with the{ell} 2,1-norm involved. Extensive experiments have shown that G3DC offers high clustering accuracy with regard to agreement with true cell types, outperforming other leading single-cell clustering methods. In addition, G3DC selects biologically relevant genes that contribute to the clustering, providing insight into biological functionality that differentiate cell groups.",

Peru is considered a megadiverse country with many endemic species of plants, terrestrial, and marine animals, and microorganisms. NPs databases have a major impact on drug discovery development. For this reason, several countries such as Mexico, Brazil, India, and China have initiatives to assemble and maintain NPs databases that are representative of their diversity and ethnopharmacological usage. We describe the assembly, curation, and full chemoinformatic evaluation of the content and coverage in chemical space, as well as the physicochemical attributes and chemical diversity of the initial version of the Peruvian Natural Products Database (PeruNPDB), which contains 280 compounds. Access to PeruNPDB is available for free (https://perunpdb.com.pe/).

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are the cellular organelles responsible for resynthesising the majority of ATP. In skeletal muscle, there is an increased ATP turnover during resistance exercise to sustain the energetic demands of muscle contraction. Despite this, little is known regarding the mitochondrial characteristics of chronically strength-trained individuals and any potential pathways regulating the strength-specific mitochondrial remodelling. Here, we investigated the mitochondrial structural characteristics in skeletal muscle of strength athletes and age-matched untrained controls. The mitochondrial pool in strength athletes was characterised by increased mitochondrial cristae density, decreased mitochondrial size, and increased surface-to-volume ratio, despite similar mitochondrial volume density. We also provide a fibre-type and compartment specific assessment of mitochondria morphology in human skeletal muscle, which reveals across groups a compartment-specific influence on mitochondrial morphology that is largely independent of fibre-type. Furthermore, we show that resistance exercise leads to signs of mild mitochondrial stress, without an increase in the number of damaged mitochondria. Using publicly available transcriptomic data we show that acute resistance exercise increases the expression of markers of mitochondrial biogenesis, fission, and mitochondrial unfolded protein responses (UPRmt). Further, we observed an enrichment of the UPRmt in the basal transcriptome of strength-trained individuals. Together, these findings show that strength athletes possess a unique mitochondrial remodelling, which minimises the space required for mitochondria. We propose that the concurrent activation of markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial remodelling pathways (fission and UPRmt) with resistance exercise may be partially responsible for the observed mitochondrial phenotype of strength athletes.",

    "abstract": "After stroke, impaired motor performance is linked to an increased demand for cognitive resources. Aerobic exercise improves cognitive function in healthy populations and may be effective in altering cognitive function post-stroke. We sought to determine if high intensity aerobic exercise paired with motor training in individuals with chronic stroke alters cognitive-motor function and functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a key region for cognitive-motor processes, and the sensorimotor network. Twenty-five participants with chronic stroke were randomly assigned to exercise (n = 14; 66 {+/-} 11 years; 4 females), or control (n = 11; 68 {+/-} 8 years; 2 females) groups. Both groups performed five-days of paretic upper limb motor training after either high intensity aerobic exercise (3 intervals of 3 minutes each, total exercise duration of 23-minutes) or watching a documentary (control). Resting-state fMRI, and TMT-A and B were recorded pre- and post-intervention. Both groups showed implicit motor sequence learning (p < .001), but there was no added benefit of exercise (p = .738). Regardless of group, the changes in task score (p = .025), and dwell time (p = .043) were correlated with a decrease in DLPFC-sensorimotor network functional connectivity (p = .024), which is thought to reflect a reduction in the cognitive demand and increased automaticity. The exercise group experienced greater overall cognitive-motor improvements measured with the trail making test part A (TMT-A: task score: p = .012; dwell time: p = .024; movement time: p = .567). Aerobic exercise may improve cognitive-motor processing speed post-stroke.\n\nSignificance statementAfter stroke, impaired motor performance is linked to an increased demand for cognitive resources. In our work we show that high intensity aerobic exercise paired with an implicit motor learning task improves cognitive-motor processing speed and reduces resting-state functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the sensorimotor network in individuals living with chronic stroke. These data likely reflect a reduction in cognitive resource dependence during a cognitive-motor task after stroke and a shift towards cognitive-motor automaticity.",

    "abstract": "The immune system continually battles against pathogen-induced pressures, which often leads to the evolutionary expansion of immune gene families in a species-specific manner. For example, the pals gene family expanded to 39 members in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome, in comparison to a single mammalian pals ortholog. Our previous studies have revealed that two members of this family, pals-22 and pals-25, act as antagonistic paralogs to control the Intracellular Pathogen Response (IPR). The IPR is a protective transcriptional response, which is activated upon infection by two molecularly distinct natural intracellular pathogens of C. elegans - the Orsay virus and the fungus Nematocida parisii from the microsporidia phylum. In this study, we identify a previously uncharacterized member of the pals family, pals-17, as a newly described negative regulator of the IPR. pals-17 mutants show constitutive upregulation of IPR gene expression, increased immunity against intracellular pathogens, as well as impaired development and reproduction. We also find that two other previously uncharacterized pals genes, pals-20 and pals-16, are positive regulators of the IPR, acting downstream of pals-17. These positive regulators reverse the effects caused by the loss of pals-17 on IPR gene expression, immunity and development. We show that the negative IPR regulator protein PALS-17 and the positive IPR regulator protein PALS-20 colocalize inside intestinal epithelial cells, which are the sites of infection for IPR-inducing pathogens. In summary, our study demonstrates that several pals genes from the expanded pals gene family act as ON/OFF switch modules to regulate a balance between organismal development and immunity against natural intracellular pathogens in C. elegans.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYImmune responses to pathogens induce extensive rewiring of host physiology. In the short term, these changes are generally beneficial as they can promote resistance against infection. However, prolonged activation of immune responses can have serious negative consequences on host health, including impaired organismal development and fitness. Therefore, the balance between activating the immune system and promoting development must be precisely regulated. In this study, we used genetics to identify a gene in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans called pals-17 that acts as a repressor of the Intracellular Pathogen Response (IPR), a defense response against viral and microsporidian infections. We also found that pals-17 is required for the normal development of these animals. Furthermore, we identified two other pals genes, pals-20 and pals-16, as suppressors of pals-17 mutant phenotypes. Finally, we found that PALS-17 and PALS-20 proteins colocalize inside intestinal cells, where viruses and microsporidia invade and replicate in the host. Taken together, our study demonstrates a balance between organismal development and immunity that is regulated by several genetic ON/OFF switch  modules in C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are prominent root symbionts with a multinucleate cytoplasm that can carry thousands of nuclei deriving from two parental strains and varying in relative abundance in a large syncytium. Here, we set out to improve our understanding of such remarkable genetics by resolving the nuclear genomes of all publicly available AMF heterokaryons using PacBio HiFi and Hi-C sequencing. We find that all AMF heterokaryons carry two sets of homologous chromosomes, where genes associated with plant colonization reside in gene-sparse, repeat-rich compartments. The co-existing nuclear genomes are phylogenetically related but differ significantly in content and epigenetics, resulting in nucleus-specific regulatory programs during mycorrhizal interactions. AMF heterokaryons carry signatures of past genetic exchange indicative of sexual reproduction, followed by clonal haplotype evolution. This work uncovers the contribution and origin of nuclear genomes present in AMF heterokaryons and opens avenues for improvement and environmental application of these strains.",

    "abstract": "Sleep deprivation (SD) results in profound cellular and molecular changes in the adult mammalian brain. Some of these changes may result in, or aggravate, brain disease. However, little is known about how SD impacts gene expression in developing animals. We examined the transcriptional response in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to SD across postnatal development in male mice. We used RNA sequencing to identify functional gene categories that were specifically impacted by SD. We find that SD has dramatically different effects on PFC genes depending on developmental age. Gene expression differences after SD fall into 3 categories: present at all ages (conserved), present when mature sleep homeostasis is first emerging, and those unique to certain ages in adults. Developmentally conserved gene expression was limited to a few functional categories, including Wnt-signaling which suggests that this pathway is a core mechanism regulated by sleep. In younger ages, genes primarily related to growth and development are affected while changes in genes related to metabolism are specific to the effect of SD in adults.",

    "abstract": "Aging is the primary risk factor for most neurodegenerative diseases, and recently coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with severe neurological manifestations that can eventually impact neurodegenerative conditions in the long-term. The progressive accumulation of senescent cells in vivo strongly contributes to brain aging and neurodegenerative co-morbidities but the impact of virus-induced senescence in the aetiology of neuropathologies is unknown. Here, we show that senescent cells accumulate in physiologically aged brain organoids of human origin and that senolytic treatment reduces inflammation and cellular senescence; for which we found that combined treatment with the senolytic drugs dasatinib and quercetin rejuvenates transcriptomic human brain aging clocks. We further interrogated brain frontal cortex regions in postmortem patients who succumbed to severe COVID-19 and observed increased accumulation of senescent cells as compared to age-matched control brains from non-COVID-affected individuals. Moreover, we show that exposure of human brain organoids to SARS-CoV-2 evoked cellular senescence, and that spatial transcriptomic sequencing of virus-induced senescent cells identified a unique SARS-CoV-2 variant-specific inflammatory signature that is different from endogenous naturally-emerging senescent cells. Importantly, following SARS-CoV-2 infection of human brain organoids, treatment with senolytics blocked viral retention and prevented the emergence of senescent corticothalamic and GABAergic neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate in human ACE2 overexpressing mice that senolytic treatment ameliorates COVID-19 brain pathology following infection with SARS-CoV-2. In vivo treatment with senolytics improved SARS-CoV-2 clinical phenotype and survival, alleviated brain senescence and reactive astrogliosis, promoted survival of dopaminergic neurons, and reduced viral and senescence-associated secretory phenotype gene expression in the brain. Collectively, our findings demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 can trigger cellular senescence in the brain, and that senolytic therapy mitigates senescence-driven brain aging and multiple neuropathological sequelae caused by neurotropic viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major cause of death in the elderly. Cognitive decline due to Alzheimers disease (AD) is frequent in the geriatric population disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Interestingly, central nervous system (CNS) manifestations have been reported in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. In this study, we investigated the levels of Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the main entry receptor of SARS-COV-2 in cells, in postmortem parietal cortex samples from two independent AD cohorts, totalling 142 persons. Higher concentrations of ACE2 protein and mRNA were found in individuals with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD compared to age-matched healthy control subjects. Brain levels of soluble ACE2 were inversely associated with cognitive scores (p = 0.02), markers of pericytes (PDGFR{beta}, p=0.02 and ANPEP, p = 0.007) and caveolin1 (p = 0.03), but positively correlated with soluble amyloid-{beta} peptides (A{beta}) concentrations (p = 0.01) and insoluble phospho- tau (S396/404, p = 0.002). No significant differences in ACE2 were observed in the 3xTgAD mouse model of tau and A{beta} neuropathology. Results from immunofluorescence and Western blots showed that ACE2 protein is mainly localized in neurons in the human brain but predominantly in microvessels in the mouse brain. The present data show that an AD diagnosis is associated with higher levels of soluble ACE2 in the human brain, which might contribute to a higher risk of CNS SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus pathogen of the currently prevailing COVID-19 pandemic. It relies on its main protease (MPro) for replication and pathogenesis. MPro is a demonstrated target for the development of antivirals for SARS-CoV-2. Past studies have systematically explored tripeptidyl inhibitors such as nirmatrelvir as MPro inhibitors. However, dipeptidyl inhibitors especially those with a spiro residue at their P2 position have not been systematically investigated. In this work, we synthesized about 30 reversibly covalent dipeptidyl MPro inhibitors and characterized them on in vitro enzymatic inhibition potency, structures of their complexes with MPro, cellular MPro inhibition potency, antiviral potency, cytotoxicity, and in vitro metabolic stability. Our results indicated that MPro has a flexible S2 pocket that accommodates dipeptidyl inhibitors with a large P2 residue and revealed that dipeptidyl inhibitors with a large P2 spiro residue such as (S)-2-azaspiro[4,4]nonane-3-carboxylate and (S)-2-azaspiro[4,5]decane-3-carboxylate have optimal characteristics. One compound MPI60 containing a P2 (S)-2-azaspiro[4,4]nonane-3-carboxylate displayed high antiviral potency, low cellular cytotoxicity, and high in vitro metabolic stability and can be potentially advanced to further preclinical tests.",

    "abstract": "The unprecedented pandemic of COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has led to massive human suffering, death, and economic devastation worldwide. The virus is mutating fast to more transmissible and infectious variants. The Delta variant (B.1.617.2), initially identified in India, and the omicron variant (BA.4 and BA.5) have spread worldwide. In addition, recently alarming antibody evasive SARS-CoV-2 subvariants, BQ and XBB, have been reported. These new variants may pose a substantial challenge to controlling the spread of this virus. Therefore, the continued development of novel drugs having pan-coronavirus inhibition to treat and prevent infection of COVID-19 is urgently needed. These drugs will be critically important in dealing with new pandemics that will emerge in the future. We report the discovery of several highly potent small molecule pan-coronavirus inhibitors. One of which, NBCoV63, showed low nM potency against SARS-CoV-2 (IC50: 55 nM), SARS-CoV (IC50: 59 nM), and MERS-CoV (IC50: 75 nM) in pseudovirus-based assays with excellent selectivity indices (SI: as high as > 900) demonstrating its pan-coronavirus inhibition. NBCoV63 showed equally effective antiviral potency against SARS-CoV-2 mutant (D614G) and several variants of concerns (VOCs) such as B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.1.529/BA.1 and BA.4/BA.5 (Omicron) and K417T/E484K/N501Y (Gamma). NBCoV63 also showed similar efficacy profiles to Remdesivir against authentic SARS-CoV-2 (Hong Kong strain) and two of its variants (Delta and Omicron) by plaque reduction in Calu3 cells. Additionally, we show that NBCoV63 inhibits virus-mediated cell-to-cell fusion in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) data of NBCoV63 demonstrated drug-like properties.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a robust ability to adapt in response to environmental pressures--increasing viral transmission and evading immune surveillance by mutating its molecular machinery. While viral sequencing has allowed for the early detection of emerging variants, methods to predict mutations before they occur remain limited. This work presents SpikeGPT2, a deep generative model based on ProtGPT2 and fine-tuned on SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein sequences deposited in the NIH Data Hub before May 2021. SpikeGPT2 achieved 88.8% next-residue prediction accuracy and successfully predicted amino acid substitutions found only in a held-out set of spike sequences deposited on or after May 2021, to which SpikeGPT2 was never exposed. When compared to several other methods, SpikeGPT2 achieved the best performance in predicting such future mutations. SpikeGPT2 also predicted several novel variants not present in the NIH SARS-CoV-2 Data Hub. A binding affinity analysis of all 54 generated substitutions identified 5 (N439A, N440G, K458T, L492I, and N501Y) as predicted to simultaneously increase S/ACE2 affinity, and decrease S/tixagevimab+cilgavimab affinity. Of these, N501Y has already been well-described to increase transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. These findings indicate that SpikeGPT2 and other similar models may be employed to identify high-risk future variants before viral spread has occurred.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variants conferring risk for Parkinsons disease have been highlighted through genome-wide association studies, yet exploration of their specific disease mechanisms is lacking. Two Parkinsons disease candidate genes, KAT8 and KANSL1, identified through genome-wide studies and a PINK1-mitophagy screen, encode part of the histone acetylating non-specific lethal complex. This complex localises to the nucleus, where it has a role in transcriptional activation, and to mitochondria, where it has been suggested to have a role in mitochondrial transcription. In this study, we sought to identify whether the non-specific lethal complex has potential regulatory relationships with other genes associated with Parkinsons disease in human brain.\n\nCorrelation in the expression of non-specific lethal genes and Parkinsons disease-associated genes was investigated in primary gene co-expression networks utilising publicly available transcriptomic data from multiple brain regions (provided by the Genotype-Tissue Expression Consortium and UK Brain Expression Consortium), whilst secondary networks were used to examine cell-type specificity. Reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks generated regulons of the complex, which were tested for heritability using stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression and then validated in vitro using the QuantiGene multiplex assay.\n\nSignificant clustering of non-specific lethal genes was revealed alongside Parkinsons disease-associated genes in frontal cortex primary co-expression modules. Both primary and secondary co-expression modules containing these genes were enriched for mainly neuronal cell types. Regulons of the complex contained Parkinsons disease-associated genes and were enriched for biological pathways genetically linked to disease. When examined in a neuroblastoma cell line, 41% of prioritised gene targets showed significant changes in mRNA expression following KANSL1 or KAT8 perturbation.\n\nIn conclusion, genes encoding the non-specific lethal complex are highly correlated with and regulate genes associated with Parkinsons disease. Overall, these findings reveal a potentially wider role for this protein complex in regulating genes and pathways implicated in Parkinsons disease.",

    "abstract": "The impact of large-scale chromosomal rearrangements, such as fusions and fissions, on speciation is a long-standing conundrum. We assessed whether bursts of change in chromosome numbers resulting from chromosomal fusion and fission are related to increased speciation rates in Erebia, one of the most species-rich and karyotypically variable butterfly groups. We established a genome-based phylogeny and employed state-dependent birth-death models to infer trajectories of karyotype evolution across this genus. We demonstrated that rates of anagenetic chromosomal changes (i.e. along phylogenetic branches) exceed cladogenetic changes (i. e. at speciation events), but when cladogenetic changes occur, they are mostly associated with chromosomal fissions rather than fusions. Moreover, we found that the relative importance of fusion and fission differs among Erebia clades of different ages, where especially in younger, more karyotypically diverse clades, speciation is more frequently associated with chromosomal changes. Overall, our results imply that chromosomal fusions and fissions have contrasting macroevolutionary roles and that large-scale chromosomal rearrangements are associated with bursts of species diversification.",

    "abstract": "The standard evolutionary theory of ageing predicts a negative relationship (trade-off) between fecundity and longevity. However, this relationship can become positive: (i) under the influence of longevity-enhancing mutations; (ii) when individuals have unequal resources; and (iii) in eusocial insects, in which reproductive queens outlive less- or non-reproductive workers. Developmental diet is likely to be central to determining trade-offs as it affects key fitness traits such as adult body size, but its exact role remains uncertain. For example, in Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies, changes in adult diet can affect fecundity, longevity, and gene expression throughout life, but it is unknown how changes in developmental (larval) diet affect fecundity-longevity relationships or gene expression in adults. Using D. melanogaster, we therefore tested the hypothesis that variation in developmental diet alters the directionality of fecundity-longevity relationships in adults, and characterised associated gene expression changes. We reared D. melanogaster larvae on low (20%), medium (100%), and high (120%) SYA (Sugar Yeast Agar) diets, and transferred adult females developing from these larvae to a common (110% SYA) adult diet. We measured life-time fertility (realised fecundity) and longevity of individual adult females and, using mRNA-seq, profiled gene expression changes across two time-points. Adult females raised on the different larval diets exhibited fecundity-longevity relationships that were significantly different in directionality, i.e., varied from positive to negative, despite minimal differences in mean life-time fertility or longevity. Treatments also differed in age-related gene expression, including expression of genes known to be associated with ageing. Hence, this study shows that the sign of fecundity-longevity relationships in adult insects can be altered and even reversed by variation in larval diet quality. Furthermore, larval diet quality may be a key mechanistic factor underpinning positive fecundity-longevity relationships observed in species such as eusocial insects.",

    "abstract": "Strategies to target specific protein cysteines are critical to covalent probe and drug discovery. 3-bromo-4,5-dihy-droxazole is a natural product-inspired, synthetically accessible electrophilic moiety that has previously been shown to react with nucleophilic cysteines in the active site of purified enzymes. Here we define the global cysteine reactivity and selectivity of a set of 3-bromo-4,5-dihydroxazole-functionalized chemical fragments using competitive chemoproteomic profiling methods. Our study demonstrates that 3-bromo-4,5-dihydroxazoles capably engage reactive cysteine residues in the human proteome and the selectivity landscape of cysteines liganded by 3-bromo-4,5-dihydroxazoles is distinct from that of haloacetamide electrophiles. Given its tem-pered reactivity, 3-bromo-4,5-dihydroxazoles showed restricted, selective engagement with proteins driven by interactions between a tunable binding element and the complementary protein sites. We further validate that 3-bromo-4,5-dihydroxazoles form covalent conjugates with glutathione S-transferase Pi (GSTP1) and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (PIN1), emerging anti-cancer targets. Together, this study expands the spectrum of optimizable chemical tools for covalent ligand discovery and high-lights the utility of 3-bromo-4,5-dihydroxazole as a cysteine-reactive electrophile.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=57 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/524242v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (15K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13b987eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1987ae1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ab4fb9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ff1f71_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "A burning concern among researchers studying enzyme kinetics has been ways of improving the accuracy of initial rates (v) with much greater precision. The goal of this study was to establish a formal (mathematical) way of achieving more accurate v values in enzyme assay. By adopting Bernfeld method of assay, the v values generated and other values in the literature were explored with two main objectives:1) to derive equations for a correctional calculation of initial rates and for the calculation of Michaelis-Menten (MM) parameters and 2) to evaluate the derived equations. The results of study showed that the maximum velocity (Vmax) and the MM constant (KM) obtained from a robust nonlinear regression (RNR) using v values in the literature were respectively between 21 and 26-fold and 6.56 to 61.2-fold greater than values generated from other method such as double reciprocal plot (drp), reciprocal variant of direct linear plot (RVDLP), and new method (z-model) derived based on MM equation; the Vmax and KM values (for alpha-amylase) calculated based on the RVDLP using the uncorrected v values were respectively 1.26- and 1.264-fold greater than the values using corrected v values; based on the z method, the Vmax and KM values using the uncorrected v values were 179.8- and 9.35-fold greater than the values using their corrected counterparts. In conclusion, the erroneous initial rates can be corrected using new equations before fitting RNR, RVDLP, drp, and any other equation to the corrected v values for the determination of MM parameters.\n\nGraphical Abstract figure\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=122 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/524223v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2d6dcborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@833f08org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9f4648org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bf2e9f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG The implication of the result in b (i) is that the Vmax and KM should either be a negative value or infinite value according to the equations unlike b (ii).",

Unprocessed and mainly non-glycosylated IGF2 proforms are found at abnormally high levels in certain diseases, but their mode of action is still unclear. Here, we found that pro-IGF2(156) has the lowest ability to form its inactivating complexes with IGF-Binding Proteins and has higher proliferative properties in cells than IGF2 and other IGF prohormones. We also showed that big-IGF2(104) has a seven-fold higher binding affinity for the IGF2 receptor than IGF2, and that pro-IGF2(87) binds and activates specific receptors and stimulates cell growth similarly to the mature IGF2. The properties of these pro-IGF2 forms, especially of pro-IGF2(156) and big-IGF2(104), indicate them as hormones that may be associated with human diseases related to the accumulation of IGF-2 proforms in the circulation.",

This makes it difficult to identify whether the authors have identified true biological signal and how robust these models would be in use as clinical biomarkers.

    "abstract": "Ductal and acinar pancreatic organoids generated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are promising models to study pancreatic diseases, including precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer. Genome sequencing studies have revealed that mutations in a G-protein (GNASR201C) are exclusively observed in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), one of the most common cystic pancreatic precancerous lesions. GNASR201C cooperates with oncogenic KRASG12V/D to produce IPMN lesions in mice; however, the biological mechanisms by which oncogenic GNAS affects the ductal and acinar exocrine pancreas are not understood. In this study, we use pancreatic ductal and acinar organoids generated from human embryonic stem cells to investigate mechanisms by which GNASR201C functions. As expected, GNASR201C-induced cell proliferation in acinar organoids was PKA-dependent. Surprisingly, GNASR201C-induced cell proliferation independent of the canonical PKA signaling in short-term and stable, long-term cultures of GNAS-expressing ductal organoids and in an immortalized ductal epithelial cell line, demonstrating that GNASR201C uses PKA-dependent and independent mechanisms to induce cell proliferation in the exocrine pancreas. Co-expression of oncogenic KRASG12V and GNASR201C induced cell proliferation in ductal and acini organoids in a PKA-independent and dependent manner, respectively. Thus, we identify cell lineage-specific roles for PKA signaling driving pre-cancerous lesions and report the development of a human pancreatic ductal organoid model system to investigate mechanisms regulating GNASR201C-induced IPMNs.",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) remains the main reason of drug development attritions largely due to poor mechanistic understanding. Toxicogenomics to interrogate the mechanism of DILI has been broadly performed. Gene network-based transcriptome analysis is a bioinformatics approach that potentially contributes to improving mechanistic interpretation of toxicogenomics data. In this current study, we performed an extensive concentration time course response-toxicogenomics study in the HepG2 cell line exposed to various DILI compounds, reference compounds for stress response pathways, cytokine receptors, and growth factor receptors. We established > 500 conditions subjected to whole transcriptome targeted RNA sequences and applied weighted gene co-regulated network analysis (WGCNA) to the transcriptomics data followed by identification of gene networks (modules) that were strongly modulated upon the exposure of DILI compounds. Preservation analysis on the module responses of HepG2 and PHH demonstrated highly preserved adaptive stress responses gene networks. We correlated gene network with cell death as the progressive cellular outcomes. Causality of the target genes of these modules was evaluated using RNA interference validation experiments. We identified that GTPBP2, HSPA1B, IRF1, SIRT1 and TSC22D3 exhibited strong causality towards cell death. Altogether, we demonstrate the application of large transcriptome datasets combined with network-based analysis and biological validation to uncover the candidate determinants of DILI.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal fragility is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here, in a mouse model for youth-onset T2D, we show that both trabecular and cortical bone mass are reduced due to diminished osteoblast activity. Stable isotope tracing in vivo with 13C-glucose demonstrates that both glycolysis and glucose fueling of the TCA cycle are impaired in diabetic bones. Similarly, Seahorse assays show suppression of both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation by diabetes in bone marrow mesenchymal cells as a whole, whereas single-cell RNA sequencing reveals distinct modes of metabolic dysregulation among the subpopulations. Metformin not only promotes glycolysis and osteoblast differentiation in vitro, but also improves bone mass in diabetic mice. Finally, targeted overexpression of Hif1a or Pfkfb3 in osteoblasts of T2D mice averts bone loss. The study identifies osteoblast-intrinsic defects in glucose metabolism as an underlying cause of diabetic osteopenia, which may be targeted therapeutically.",

Such proteoforms can have altered localizations, stabilities and functions. While proteoforms generated from splice variants can be engaged in different protein complexes, it remained to be studied to what extent this applies to N-terminal proteoforms. To address this, we mapped the interactomes of several pairs of N-terminal proteoforms and their canonical counterparts. First, we generated a catalogue of N-terminal proteoforms found in the HEK293T cellular cytosol from which 22 pairs were selected for interactome profiling. Additionally, we provide evidence for the expression of several N-terminal proteoforms, identified in our catalogue, across different human tissues as well as tissue-specific expression, highlighting their biological relevance. Protein-protein interaction profiling revealed that the overlap of the interactomes for both proteoforms is generally high, showing their functional relation. We also showed that N-terminal proteoforms can be engaged in new interactions and/or lose several interactions compared to their canonical counterpart, thus further expanding the functional diversity of proteomes.",

    "abstract": "The giant clam Tridacna crocea inhabits shallow tropical seas with poorly nourished water and severe sun irradiation. They harbor symbiotic algae \"zooxanthellae\" (dinoflagellate family Symbiodiniaceae) in the mantle tissue and are thought to thrive in this extreme environment by utilizing photosynthetic products from the algae. However, there is no measure of the detailed metabolic flow between the host and symbiont to evaluate one of the most successful symbiotic relationships in nature. Here, we employed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based lipidomics and Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance MS imaging on T. crocea tissues, revealing a unique lipid composition and localization with their symbiont algae. We discovered that the non-phosphorous microalgal betaine lipid diacylglycerylcarboxy-hydroxymethylcholine (DGCC) was present in all tissues and organs of T. crocea to approximately the same degree as phosphatidylcholine (PC). The fatty acid composition of DGCC was similar to that of PC, which is thought to have physiological roles similar to that of DGCC. MS imaging showed co-localization of these lipids throughout the clam tissues. Glycerylcarboxy-hydroxymethylcholine (GCC), the deacylated derivative of DGCC, was found to be a free form of DGCC in the clams and was isolated and characterized from cultured Symbiodiniaceae strains that were isolated from giant clams. These results strongly suggest that giant clams have evolved to smartly utilize DGCCs, phosphorus-free polar lipids of symbiont algae, as essential membrane components to enable them to thrive in oligotrophic coral reef milieu.",

Many neurons exhibit mixed selectivity, that is, they show selectivity for multiple variables. A fundamental question is whether neurons are functionally specialized for particular variables and how selectivity for different variables intersects across the population. Here, we analyzed neural correlates of space and time in rats performing a navigational task with two behaviorally important categories - starts and goals. Using simultaneous recordings of many medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons during behavior, we found that population codes for elapsed time were invariant to different locations within categories, and subsets of neurons had functional preferences for time or space across categories. Thus, mPFC exhibits structured selectivity, which may facilitate complex behaviors by efficiently generating informative representations of multiple variables.",

    "abstract": "1Alzheimers disease (AD) accounts for 60-70% of dementia cases. Current treatments are inadequate and there is a need to develop new approaches to AD drug discovery. We chose to develop a cell phenotype-based drug screen centred on the AD-risk gene, SORL1, which encodes the protein SORLA. Increased AD risk has been repeatedly linked to variants in SORL1, particularly those that confer loss of, or decreased, SORLA. This is consistent with the lower SORL1 levels observed in post-mortem brain samples from individuals with AD. Consistent with its role in the endolysosomal pathway, deletion of SORL1 is associated with enlarged endosomes in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons. We, therefore, hypothesised that multiparametric, image-based phenotyping would identify features characteristic of SORL1 deletion. An automated morphological profiling assay (known as Cell Painting) was adapted to wild-type and SORL1-/- NPCs. This methodology was used to determine the phenotypic response of SORL1-/- NPCs to treatment with compounds from a small FDA/internationally-approved drug library (TargetMol, 330 compounds). We detected distinct phenotypic signatures for SORL1-/- NPCs compared to isogenic wild-type controls. Furthermore, we identified 16 approved drugs that reversed the mutant morphological signatures in NPCs derived from 3 SORL1-/- subclonal iPSC lines. Network pharmacology analysis revealed the 16 compounds belonged to five mechanistic groups: 20S proteasome, aldehyde dehydrogenase, topoisomerase I and II, and DNA synthesis inhibitors. Enrichment analysis confirmed targeting to gene sets associated with these annotated targets, and to pathways/biological processes associated with DNA synthesis/damage/repair, Proteases/proteasome and metabolism._Prediction of novel targets for some compounds revealed enrichment in pathways associated with neural cell function and AD. The findings suggest that image-based phenotyping by morphological profiling distinguishes SORL1-/- NPCs from isogenic wild-type lines, and predicts treatment responses that rescue SORL1-/--associated cellular signatures that are relevant to both SORLA function and AD. Overall, this work suggests that i) a quantitative phenotypic metric can distinguish iPSC-derived SORL1-/- NPCs from isogenic wild-type control and ii) phenotypic screening combined with multiparametric high-content image analysis is a viable option for drug repurposing and discovery in this human neural cell model of Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the master mammalian circadian clock. Its cell-autonomous timing mechanism, a transcriptional/translational feedback loop (TTFL), drives daily peaks of neuronal electrical activity. Intercellular signals synchronize and amplify TTFL and electrical rhythms across the circuit. SCN neurons are GABAergic, but the role of GABA in circuit-level time-keeping is unclear. SCN slices expressing the GABA sensor iGABASnFR demonstrate a circadian oscillation of extracellular GABA ([GABA]e) that, counter-intuitively, runs in antiphase to neuronal activity, peaking in circadian night. Resolving this paradox, we found that [GABA]e is regulated by GABA transporters (GATs), uptake peaking during circadian day. This is mediated by the circadian-regulated, astrocytically expressed GAT3 (Slc6a11). Clearance of [GABA]e in circadian day facilitates neuronal firing, neuropeptide release and TTFL rhythmicity. Moreover, genetic complementation demonstrated that the astrocytic TTFL can alone drive [GABA]e rhythms. Thus, astrocytic clocks maintain SCN circadian time-keeping by temporally controlling GABAergic inhibition of SCN neurons.",

    "abstract": "The brainstem locus coeruleus (LC) influences a broad range of brain processes, including cognition. The so-called LC contrast is an accepted marker of the integrity of the LC that consists of a local hyperintensity on specific Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) structural images. The small size of the LC has, however, rendered its functional characterization difficult in humans, including in aging. A full characterization of the structural and functional characteristics of the LC in healthy young and late middle-aged individuals is needed to determine to potential roles of the LC in different medical conditions. Here, we wanted to determine whether the activation of the LC in a mismatch negativity task changes in aging and whether the LC functional response was associated to the LC contrast. We used Ultra-High Field (UHF) 7-Tesla functional MRI (fMRI) to record brain response during an auditory oddball task in 53 healthy volunteers, including 34 younger (age: 22.15y {+/-} 3.27; 29 women) and 19 late middle-aged (age: 61.05y {+/-} 5.3; 14 women) individuals. Whole-brain analyses confirmed brain responses in the typical cortical and subcortical regions previously associated with mismatch negativity. When focusing on the brainstem, we found a significant response in the rostral part of the LC probability mask generated based on individual LC images. Although bilateral, the activation was more extensive in the left LC. Individual LC activity was not significantly different between young and late middle-aged individuals. Critically, while the LC contrast was higher in older individuals, the functional response of the LC was not associated with its contrast. These findings show that the age-related alterations of the LC structural integrity may not necessarily be related to changes in its functional response. The results further indicate that LC responses could remain stable in healthy individuals aged 20 to 70.",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposePain management is a major health burden. Pain results from the integration of the nociceptive message and neuronal communication relying on neurotransmitters such as glutamate, {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin in brain regions including the periaqueductal gray (PAG), the nucleus accumbens (Nac), the caudate-putamen (Cpu) and the amygdala. Morphine remains the gold standard painkiller for severe pain via the activation of the mu opioid receptors. However, among side effects, morphine chronic treatment lead to antinociceptive tolerance. As antinociceptive tolerance might be linked to neurotransmission dysregulation, we have compared various neurotransmitter concentrations in acute vs chronic morphine conditions in the amygdala, PAG, Cpu, and the Nac of male and female mice.\n\nExperimental approachSex differences in morphine antinociception and tolerance were assessed using the tail-immersion test. The behavioural effects of acute and chronic morphine treatments, as well as sex differences in the levels of dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, glutamate and GABA in the amygdala, PAG, Cpu, and the Nac were determined by an absolute quantification LC-MS/MS approach using the isotopic dilution method.\n\nKey resultsThis study indicates, as previously reported, that female mice are less sensitive to morphine and develop morphine antinociceptive tolerance earlier than males (ED50 of 5.5{+/-}0.24 days vs 1.54{+/-}0.11 days, respectively). However, the rate at which the tolerance developed did not differ between both sex. We have found major differences in dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, glutamate and GABA levels between female and male mice in the amygdala, PAG, Cpu, and the Nac. Finally, no major effect of anti-nociceptive tolerance induced by chronic morphine was observed compared to acute administration of morphine.\n\nConclusionNeurotransmitter differences are attributable mainly to sex differences in pain-related CNS regions. However, the impacts of morphine anti-nociceptive tolerance on dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, glutamate and GABA contents appeared to be limited.",

    "abstract": "Activation of CD40-mediated signaling in antigen-presenting cells is a promising therapeutic strategy to promote immune responses against tumors. Agonistic anti-CD40 antibodies currently in development require Fc{gamma}-receptor-mediated crosslinking of CD40 molecules for meaningful activation of CD40 signaling but have limitations due to dose-limiting toxicities. Here we describe the identification of CD40 antibodies which strongly stimulate antigen-presenting cells in an entirely Fc-independent manner. These novel Fc-silenced anti-CD40 antibodies induce upregulation of costimulatory receptors CD80 and CD86 and cytokine release by dendritic cells with an efficacy exceeding that of existing antibodies. Binding to the CD40L interaction region on CD40 appears to be a prerequisite to achieving such strong activities. Finally, the most active identified anti-CD40 antibody shows evidence of activity in terms of the expected markers of canonical CD40 signaling when injected in humanized mice. There are no signs of obvious toxicities whereas the clinical-stage anti-CD40 antibody CP-870,893 induced severe signs of toxicity in these animals despite a lower dose compared with the novel Fc-silenced canonical agonist. These studies thus demonstrate potent activation of antigen-presenting cells with anti-CD40 antibodies lacking Fc{gamma}-receptor-binding activity and open the possibility of an efficacious and safe combination therapy for cancer patients.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryTreatment of antigen-presenting cells and humanized mice with novel Fc-silenced CD40 antibodies demonstrates an Fc{gamma}-receptor-independent canonical agonistic mode of action for therapeutic use.",

    "abstract": "Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), an essential cofactor in cellular metabolism, catalyses a wide range of redox reactions. The organic synthesis of FAD is typically conducted by coupling flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and adenosine monophosphate. The reported synthesis routes have certain limitations such as multiple reaction steps, low yields, and/or difficult-to-obtain starting materials. In this study, we report the synthesis of FAD nucleobase analogues using chemical and enzymatic methods with readily available starting materials achieved in 1-3 steps with moderate yields (10-51%). Further, we demonstrate that Escherichia coli glutathione reductase can use these analogues to catalyse the reduction of glutathione. Finally, we show that FAD nucleobase analogues can also be synthesized inside a cell from cellular substrates FMN and nucleoside triphosphates. This lays the foundation for their use in studying the molecular role of FAD in cellular metabolism and as biorthogonal reagents in biotechnology and synthetic biology applications.",

    "abstract": "Clarifying the mechanisms of shape alteration by insect metamorphosis is important for comprehending exoskeletal morphogenesis. The large horn of the Japanese rhinoceros beetle Trypoxylus dichotomus is the result of drastic metamorphosis, wherein it appears as a rounded shape via pupation and then undergoes remodeling into an angular adult shape. However, the mechanical mechanisms of this remodeling process remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the remodeling mechanisms of the Japanese rhinoceros beetle horn by developing a physical simulation. We identified three factors contributing to remodeling by biological experiments--ventral adhesion, uneven shrinkage, and volume reduction--which were demonstrated to be crucial to the transformation by a physical simulation. We also corroborated our findings by applying the simulation to the stag beetles mandibular remodeling. These results indicate that the physical simulation is applicable to pupal remodeling in other beetles, and the morphogenic mechanisms could explain various exoskeletal shapes.\n\nSignificance statementThe metamorphosis in insects is a mysterious process. By metamorphosis, insects sometimes change their shape dramatically. The head horn of the Japanese rhinoceros beetle is one of the most famous examples of metamorphosis. In larva-to-pupa molting, the horn appears suddenly, caused by the \"furrow formation and unfolding\" mechanism. The unfolding process makes the pupal horn rounded. However, pupa-to-adult molting transforms the rounded shape into an angular shape. In this paper, we investigated the mechanisms of the transformation. We extracted factors contributing to it through observations and experiments and developed a physical simulation. It could reproduce the adult shape from the pupal shape and could be a general model for the pupa-adult transformation of beetles.",

    "abstract": "Sterile alpha motif and histidine-aspartic acid domain containing protein-1 (SAMHD1) is a deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) triphosphohydrolase central to cellular nucleotide pool homeostasis. Recent literature has also demonstrated how SAMHD1 can detoxify chemotherapy metabolites thereby controlling their clinical responses. To further understand SAMHD1 biology and to investigate the potential of targeting this enzyme as a neoadjuvant to existing chemotherapies we set out to discover selective small molecule-based inhibitors of SAMHD1. Here we report a discovery pipeline encompassing a biochemical screening campaign and a set of complementary biochemical, biophysical, and cell-based readouts for further characterisation of the screen output. The identified hit compound TH6342 and its analogues, accompanied by their inactive negative control analogue TH7126, demonstrated specific, low M potency in inhibiting the hydrolysis of both natural substrates and nucleotide analogue therapeutics, shown using complementary enzyme-coupled and direct enzymatic activity assays. Their mode of inhibition was subsequently detailed by coupling kinetic studies with thermal shift assays, where TH6342 and analogues were shown to engage with pre-tetrameric SAMHD1 and deter the oligomerisation and allosteric activation of SAMHD1 without occupying nucleotide binding pockets. We further outline the development and application of multiple cellular assays for assessing cellular target engagement and associated functional effects, including CETSA and an in-cell dNTP hydrolase activity assay, which highlighted future optimisation strategies of this chemotype. In summary, with a novel mode of inhibition, TH6342 and analogues broaden the set of tool compounds available in deciphering SAMHD1 enzymology and functions, and furthermore, the discovery pipeline reported herein represents a thorough framework for future SAMHD1 inhibitor development.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=96 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/524275v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dc706forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@59a9b4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9473e2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4427dc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects nearly one third of the population worldwide. Understanding metabolic pathways involved can provide insights into disease progression. Untargeted metabolomics of livers from mice with early-stage steatosis indicated a decrease in methylated metabolites suggesting altered one carbon metabolism. The levels of glycine, a central component of one carbon metabolism, were lower in steatotic mice, in line with clinical evidence. Isotope tracing studies demonstrated that increased synthesis of serine from glycine is the underlying cause for glycine limitation in fatty livers. Consequently, the low glycine availability in steatotic livers impaired glutathione (GSH) synthesis under oxidative stress induced by acetaminophen (APAP), enhancing hepatic toxicity. Glycine supplementation mitigated acute liver damage and overall toxicity caused by APAP in fatty livers by supporting de novo GSH synthesis. Thus, early metabolic changes in NAFLD that lead to glycine depletion sensitize mice to xenobiotic toxicity even at a reversible stage of NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "Medical imaging represents the primary tool for investigating and monitoring several diseases, including cancer. The advances in quantitative image analysis have developed towards the extraction of biomarkers able to support clinical decisions. To produce robust results, multi-center studies are often set up. However, the imaging information must be denoised from confounding factors - known as batch-effect - like scanner-specific and center-specific influences. Moreover, in non-solid cancers, like lymphomas, effective biomarkers require an imaging-based representation of the disease that accounts for its multi-site spreading over the patients body. In this work, we address the dual-factor deconfusion problem and we propose a deconfusion algorithm to harmonize the imaging information of patients affected by Hodgkin Lymphoma in a multi-center setting. We show that the proposed model successfully denoises data from domain-specific variability while it coherently preserves the spatial relationship between imaging descriptions of peer lesions, which is a strong prognostic biomarker for tumor heterogeneity assessment. This harmonization step allows to significantly improve the performance in prognostic models, enabling building exhaustive patient representations and delivering more accurate analyses. This work lays the groundwork for performing large-scale and reproducible analyses on multi-center data that are urgently needed to convey the translation of imaging-based biomarkers into the clinical practice as effective prognostic tools.

    "abstract": "Detecting protein complexes is critical for studying cellular organizations and functions. The accumulation of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data enables the identification of protein complexes computationally. Although various computational approaches have been proposed to detect protein complexes from PPI networks, most of them ignore the signs of PPIs that reflect the ways proteins interact (activation or inhibition). As not all PPIs imply cocomplex relationships, taking into account the signs of PPIs can benefit the detection of protein complexes. Moreover, PPI networks are not static, but vary with the change of cell states or environments. However, existing protein complex identification algorithms are primarily designed for single-network clustering, and rarely consider joint clustering of multiple PPI networks. In this study, we propose a novel partially shared signed network clustering model (PS-SNC) for detecting protein complexes from multiple state-specific signed PPI networks jointly. PS-SNC can not only consider the signs of PPIs, but also identify the common and unique protein complexes in different states. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that PS-SNC outperforms other state-of-the-art protein complex detection methods. Extensive analysis on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PS-SNC in revealing novel insights about the underlying patterns of different cell lines.",

The aberrant and imbalanced signaling dynamics primarily cause a dysfunctional innate immune response, exacerbating pathogen invasion of injured tissue and further stalling the healing process. To design biological controllers that regulate the critical divergence of the immune response during septicemia, we need to understand the intricate differences in immune cell dynamics and coordinated molecular signals of healthy and sepsis injury. Here, we deployed an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based model to capture the hyper and hypo-inflammatory phases of sepsis wound healing. Our results indicate that impaired macrophage polarization leads to a high abundance of monocytes, M1, and M2 macrophage phenotypes, resulting in immune paralysis. Using a model-based analysis framework, we designed a biological controller which successfully regulates macrophage dysregulation observed in septic wounds. Our model describes a systems biology approach to predict and explore critical parameters as potential therapeutic targets capable of transitioning septic wound inflammation toward a healthy, wound-healing state.",

In the nervous system, activation of Panx1 channels have been extensively shown to contribute to distinct neurological disorders (epilepsy, chronic pain, migraine, neuroAIDS, etc.) but knowledge of extent to which these channels have a physiological role remains restricted to three studies supporting their involvement in hippocampus dependent learning. Given that Panx1 channels may provide an important mechanism for activity-dependent neuron-glia interaction, we used Panx1 transgenic mice with global and cell-type specific deletions of Panx1 to interrogate their participation in working and reference memory. Using the 8-arm radial maze, we show that long-term spatial reference memory, but not spatial working memory, is deficient in Panx1-null mice and that both astrocyte and neuronal Panx1 contribute to the consolidation of long-term spatial memory. Field potential recordings in hippocampal slices of Panx1-null mice revealed an attenuation of both long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength and long-term depression (LTD) at Schaffer collateral - CA1 synapses without alterations basal synaptic transmission or pre-synaptic paired-pulse facilitation. Our results implicate both neuronal and astrocyte Panx1 channels as critical players for the development and maintenance of long-term spatial reference memory in mice.",

Currently, there is no evidence that nonhuman primates attribute mental states to moving abstract shapes. Here we investigated whether highly social marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) process ToM and Random Frith-Happe animations differently. Our results show that marmosets and humans (1) follow more closely one of the triangles during the observation of ToM compared to Random animations, and (2) activate large and comparable brain networks when viewing ToM compared to Random animations.

    "abstract": "Levodopa has remained the mainstay of medical therapy for Parkinsons disease since its development in the 1980s. However, long-term medication use is associated with declining clinical efficacy and the emergence of motor complications. Unveiling the effects of levodopa on brain functional reorganisation at a relatively early treatment phase is therefore imperative to inform the optimisation of Parkinsons therapeutics. In this study, we comprehensively investigated levodopas modulation on the resting-state functional connectivity in the cortico- basal ganglia-cerebellum system at regional and network levels, with dual cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. The data was extracted from the Parkinsons Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The cross-sectional patient groups comprised 17 Parkinsons patients on stable levodopa medication and 15 drug-naive patients, while the longitudinal set included 14 Parkinsons patients measured at both drug-naive and levodopa-medicated conditions. With nodes defined across cortical, basal ganglia, and cerebellar networks, we conducted univariate comparisons of the internodal connectivity strength between the medication conditions using nonparametric permutation. At the network level, we computed multivariate combinations of individual connections within and between the networks, followed by an assessment of their discriminative capabilities on patients medication classes using supervised machine learning. The univariate seed-based approach showed no statistically significant effect of levodopa in either dataset. However, the network connectivity pattern between basal ganglia and the cerebellum displayed a robust classification power in the longitudinal dataset and a similar trend was observed in the cross-sectional. The role of the cerebellum is often overlooked in previous functional integration investigations of Parkinsons disease and levodopa effects. Considering the recent evidence suggesting the bidirectional communications between the cerebellum and basal ganglia networks, our study provides further insight into the importance of inter-network functional connectivity in Parkinsons, as well as in the functional and plastic processes following levodopa medication.",

    "abstract": "Synapses are pivotal sites of memory formation and undergo plasticity in response to external inputs. Consequently, synapses are hotspots of energy consumption and are susceptible to dysfunction when their energy supplies are perturbed. Mitochondria are stabilized near synapses via cytoskeletal tethering and serve as local energy supplies to fuel synaptic plasticity. However, the mechanisms that tether and stabilize neuronal mitochondria for long durations and determine the spatial dendritic segment supported during synaptic plasticity are unknown. We identified a list of novel mitochondrial-cytoskeletal interactors in neurons using APEX-based proximity labeling. We narrowed down the protein candidates that exclusively tether mitochondria to actin near postsynaptic spines using high-resolution Airyscan confocal imaging. We find that VAP, the vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum, stabilizes mitochondria via actin near the spines. To test if the VAP-dependent stable mitochondrial compartments can locally support synaptic plasticity, we investigated individual spines stimulated by two-photon glutamate uncaging for spine plasticity induction and their adjacent spines. We find that, along with actin, VAP functions as a spatial stabilizer of mitochondrial compartments to sustain synaptic plasticity for up to ~60 min and as a spatial ruler that determines the ~30 m length of the dendritic segment supporting synaptic plasticity.",

Such competitive exclusion mechanisms potentially underly microbiome dynamics, causing breakdowns of communities composed of species with similar genetic backgrounds of resource utilization. Although genes responsible for competitive exclusion among a small number of species have been investigated in pioneering studies, it remains a major challenge to integrate genomics and ecology for understanding stable coexistence in species-rich communities. Here, we show that community-scale analyses of functional gene redundancy can provide a useful platform for interpreting and predicting collapse of bacterial communities. Through 110-day time-series of experimental microbiome dynamics, we analyzed the metagenome-assembled genomes of co-occurring bacterial species. We then inferred ecological niche space based on the multivariate analysis of the genome compositions. The analysis allowed us to evaluate potential shifts in the level of niche overlap between species through time. We hypothesized that community-scale pressure of competitive exclusion could be evaluated by quantifying overlap of genetically determined resource-use profiles (metabolic pathway profiles) among coexisting species. We found that the degree of community compositional changes observed in the experimental microbiome was explained by the magnitude of gene-repertoire overlaps among bacterial species. The metagenome-based analysis of genetic potential for competitive exclusion will help us forecast major events in microbiome dynamics such as sudden community collapse (i.e., dysbiosis).",

    "abstract": "Parvovirus B19 (B19V) is transmitted primarily via the respiratory route, however, the mechanism involved remains unknown. B19V targets a restricted receptor expressed in erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow. However, B19V shifts the receptor under acidic conditions and targets the widely expressed globoside. The pH-dependent interaction with globoside may allow virus entry through the naturally acidic nasal mucosa. To test this hypothesis, MDCK II cells and well-differentiated human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) cultures were grown on porous membranes and used as models to study the interaction of B19V with the epithelial barrier. Globoside expression was detected in polarized MDCK II cells and the ciliated cell population of well-differentiated hAEC cultures. Under the acidic conditions of the nasal mucosa, virus attachment and transcytosis occurred without productive infection. Neither virus attachment nor transcytosis was observed under neutral pH conditions or in globoside knockout cells, demonstrating the concerted role of globoside and acidic pH in the transcellular transport of B19V. Globoside-dependent virus uptake involved VP2 and occurred by a clathrin-independent pathway that is cholesterol and dynamin-dependent. This study provides mechanistic insight into the transmission of B19V through the respiratory route and reveals novel vulnerability factors of the epithelial barrier to viruses.\n\nAuthor summaryThe mechanism of entry of parvovirus B19 through the respiratory epithelium remains elusive. By using polarized MDCK II and well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial cell cultures, we revealed that the virus exploits the natural acidic environment of the nasal mucosa and the expression of globoside in the ciliated cell population of the airway to breach the respiratory epithelium by transcytosis. Mechanistically, virus entry and intracellular trafficking in the epithelial cells differ substantially from that in the permissive erythroid progenitor cells.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe TprK protein of the syphilis agent, Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum (T. pallidum), undergoes antigenic variation in seven discrete variable (V) regions via non-reciprocal segmental gene conversion. These recombination events transfer information from a repertoire of 53 silent chromosomal donor cassettes (DCs) into the single tprK expression site to continually generate TprK variants. Several lines of research developed over the last two decades support the theory that this mechanism is central to T. pallidums ability for immune avoidance and persistence in the host. Structural and modeling data, for example, identify TprK as an integral outer membrane porin with the V regions exposed on the pathogens surface. Furthermore, infection-induced antibodies preferentially target the V regions rather than the predicted {beta}-barrel scaffolding, and sequence variation abrogates the binding of antibodies elicited by antigenically different V regions. Here, we engineered a T. pallidum strain to impair its ability to vary TprK and assessed its virulence in the rabbit model of syphilis.\n\nPrincipal findingsA suicide vector was transformed into the wild-type (WT) SS14 T. pallidum isolate to eliminate 96% of its tprK DCs. The resulting SS14-DCKO strain exhibited an in vitro growth rate identical to the untransformed strain, supporting that the elimination of the DCs did not affect strain viability in absence of immune pressure. In rabbits injected intradermally with the SS14-DCKO strain, generation of new TprK sequences was impaired, and the animals developed attenuated lesions with a significantly reduced treponemal burden compared to control animals. During infection, clearance of V region variants originally in the inoculum mirrored the generation of antibodies to these variants, although no new variants were generated in the SS14-DCKO strain to overcome immune pressure. Naive rabbits that received lymph node extracts from animals infected with the SS14-DCKO strain remained uninfected.\n\nConclusionThese data further support the critical role of TprK in T. pallidum virulence and persistence during infection.\n\nAuthor SummarySyphilis is still endemic in low- and middle-income countries, and it has been resurgent in high-income nations, including the U.S., for years. In endemic areas, there is still significant morbidity and mortality associated with this disease, particularly when its causative agent, the spirochete Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum (T. pallidum) infects the fetus during pregnancy. Improving our understanding of syphilis pathogenesis and T. pallidum biology could help investigators devise better control strategies for this serious infection. Now that tools to genetically manipulate this pathogen are available, we can engineer T. pallidum strains lacking specific genes or genomic regions known (or believed) to be associated with virulence. This approach can shed light on the role of the ablated genes or sequences in disease development using loss-of-function strains. Here, we derived a knockout (KO) T. pallidum mutant (SS14-DCKO) impaired in its ability to undergo antigenic variation of TprK, a protein that has long been hypothesized to be central in evasion of the host immune response and pathogen persistence during infection. When compared to the WT isolate, which is still capable of antigenic variation, the SS14-DCKO strain is significantly attenuated in its ability to proliferate and to induce early disease manifestations in infected rabbits. Our results further support the importance of TprK antigenic variation in syphilis pathogenesis and pathogen persistence.",

    "abstract": "The effector complex of RNA interference (RNAi) contains at its core an ARGONAUTE (AGO) protein bound to a small guide RNA. AGO proteins adopt a two-lobed structure in which the N-terminal (N) and Piwi-Argonaute-Zwille (PAZ) domains make up one lobe, while the middle (MID) and Piwi domains make up the other. Specific biochemical functions of PAZ, MID and Piwi domains of eukaryotic AGO proteins have been described, but the functions of the N-terminal domain remain less clear. Here, we use yeast two-hybrid screening with the N-terminal domain of the founding member of the AGO protein family, arabidopsis AGO1, to reveal that it interacts with many factors involved in regulated proteolysis. Interaction with a large group of proteins, including the autophagy cargo receptors ATI1 and ATI2, requires residues in a short, linear region, the N-coil, that joins the MID-Piwi lobe in the three-dimensional structure of AGO. In contrast, the F-box protein AUF1 interacts with AGO1 independently of the N-coil and requires distinct residues in the globular N domain itself. Mutation of AGO1 residues necessary for interaction with protein degradation factors in yeast stabilizes reporters fused to the AGO1 N-terminal domain in plants, supporting their in vivo relevance. Our results define distinct regions of the N domain implicated in protein-protein interaction, and point to a particular importance of the AGO1 N-coil as a site of interaction with regulatory factors.",

Despite the discovery of a growing number of genes associated with this disease, the molecular mechanisms of photoreceptor cell degeneration of most LCA subtypes remain poorly understood. Here, using retina-specific affinity proteomics combined with Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (U-ExM), we revealed the structural and molecular defects underlying LCA type 5 (LCA5) with unprecedented resolution. We showed that LCA5-encoded lebercilin, together with Retinitis Pigmentosa 1 protein (RP1) and the intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins IFT81 and IFT88, localize at the bulge region of the photoreceptor outer segment (OS), a region crucial for OS membrane disc formation. Next, we demonstrated that mutant mice deficient for lebercilin exhibit early axonemal defects at the bulge region and the distal OS, accompanied by reduced level of RP1 and IFT proteins, affecting membrane disc formation and presumably leading to photoreceptor death. Finally, we probed the LCA5 gene augmentation therapy strategy using U-ExM by monitoring its subcellular outcome. We found that, expression of LCA5 partially restores the bulge region, preserves OS axoneme structure and membrane disc formation, as well as photoreceptor survival.",

    "abstract": "DYRK1A, a ubiquitously expressed kinase, is linked to the dominant intellectual developmental disorder, microcephaly and Down syndrome in humans. It regulates numerous cellular processes such cell cycle, vesicle trafficking and microtubule assembly. DYRK1A is a critical regulator of organ growth, however, how it regulates organ growth is not fully understood. Here we show that knockdown of DYRK1A results in reduced cell size, which is dependent on mTORC1. Using proteomic approaches, we found that DYRK1A interacts with the Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) proteins, namely TSC1 and TSC2, which negatively regulate mTORC1 activation. Further, we show that DYRK1A phosphorylates TSC2 at T1462, a modification that is known to inhibit TSC activity and promote mTORC1 activity. We also found that the reduced cell growth upon knockdown of DYRK1A can be rescued by overexpression of RHEB, an activator of mTORC1. Our findings suggest that DYRK1A inhibits TSC complex activity through an inhibitory phosphorylation on TSC2 and thereby promotes mTORC1 activity. Further, using Drosophila neuromuscular junction as model, we show that the mnb, the fly homologues of DYRK1A, is rescued by RHEB overexpression suggesting a conserved role of DYRK1A in TORC1 regulation.",

Since ET-1, the first endothelin, was identified in 1988 as one of the most potent endothelial cell-derived vasoconstrictor peptides with long-lasting actions, the endothelin system has attracted extensive attention due to its critical role in vasoregulation and close relevance in cardiovascular-related diseases. Here we present three cryo-electron microscopy structures of ETAR and ETBR bound to ET-1 and ETBR bound to the selective peptide IRL1620. These structures reveal a highly conserved recognition mode of ET-1 and characterize the ligand selectivity by ETRs. They also present several conformation features of the active ETRs, thus revealing a specific activation mechanism.

In contrast, veiled chameleon (Chamaeleo calyptratus) embryos are pre-gastrula at oviposition, making them an excellent organism for studying L-R patterning evolution. Here we show that veiled chameleon embryos lack motile cilia in their L-R organizer, consistent with the loss of motile cilia being a synapomorphy of all reptiles. Furthermore, in contrast to avians, geckos and turtles, which have one Nodal gene, veiled chameleon exhibits expression of two paralogs of Nodal in the left lateral plate mesoderm, albeit in non-identical patterns. Using live imaging, we observed asymmetric morphological changes that precede, and likely trigger, asymmetric expression of the Nodal cascade. Thus, veiled chameleons are a new and unique model for studying the evolution of L-R patterning.",

Separately we estimated the population level changes in fitness of strains that are (vaccine type, VT) and are not (non-vaccine type, NVT) included in the vaccine, first implemented in 2009, as well as differences in strain fitness between those that are and are not resistant to penicillin. We estimated that pneumococci only become homogenously mixed across South Africa after about 50 years of transmission, with the slow spread driven by the focal nature of human mobility.

Despite a range of clinical manifestations and a high prevalence of treatment failure, L. aethiopica is the most neglected species of the Leishmania genus in terms of scientific attention. Here, we explored the genome diversity of L. aethiopica by analyzing the genomes of twenty isolates from Ethiopia. Phylogenomic analyses identified two strains as interspecific hybrids involving L. aethiopica as one parent and L. donovani and L. tropica respectively as the other parent. High levels of genome-wide heterozygosity suggest that these two hybrids are equivalent to F1 progeny that propagated mitotically since the initial hybridization event. Analyses of allelic read depths further revealed that the L. aethiopica - L. tropica hybrid was diploid and the L. aethiopica - L. donovani hybrid was triploid, as has been described for other interspecific Leishmania hybrids. When focusing on L. aethiopica, we show that this species is genetically highly diverse and consists of both asexually evolving strains and groups of recombining parasites. A remarkable observation is that some L. aethiopica strains showed an extensive loss of heterozygosity across large regions of the chromosomal genome, which likely arose from gene conversion/mitotic recombination. Hence, our prospection of L. aethiopica genomics revealed new insights into the genomic consequences of both meiotic and mitotic recombination in Leishmania.",

Because the spatiotemporal expression profiles and dynamics of neurotransmitter receptors involved in many functions are delicately governed in the brain, in vivo research tools with high spatiotemporal resolution for receptors in intact brains are highly desirable. Covalent chemical labelling of proteins without genetic manipulation is now a powerful method for analyzing receptors in vitro. However, selective target receptor labelling in the brain has not yet been achieved. This study shows that ligand-directed alkoxyacylimidazole (LDAI) chemistry can be used to selectively tether synthetic probes to target endogenous receptors in living mouse brains. The reactive LDAI reagents with negative charges were found to diffuse well over the whole brain and could selectively label target endogenous receptors, including AMPAR, NMDAR, mGlu1, and GABAAR. This simple and robust labelling protocol was then used for various applications: three-dimensional spatial mapping of endogenous receptors in the brains of healthy and disease-model mice; multi-colour receptor imaging; and pulse-chase analysis of the receptor dynamics in postnatal mouse brains. Here, results demonstrated that bioorthogonal receptor modification in living animal brains may provide innovative molecular tools that contribute to the in-depth understanding of complicated brain functions.",

    "abstract": "Chemical cross-linking of proteins coupled with mass spectrometry (CXMS) has enjoyed growing popularity in biomedical research. Most CXMS experiments utilize cross-linkers based on N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester, which react selectively with the amine groups found on the free N-termini of proteins and on the side chain of lysine (K) residues. It is also reported that under certain conditions they can react with the hydroxyl groups of serine (S), threonine (T), and tyrosine (Y). Some of the popular cross-link search engines including MeroX and xiSearch set STY, in addition to K, as cross-linkable sites by default. However, to what extent NHS ester cross-linkers react with STY under the typical CXMS experimental conditions remains unclear, nor has the reliability of STY-cross-link identifications. Here, by setting amino acids with chemically inert side chains such as glycine (G), valine (V), and leucine (L) as cross-linkable sites, which serves as a negative control, we show that software-identified STY-cross-links are only as reliable as GVL-cross-links. This is true across different NHS ester cross-linkers including DSS, DSSO, and DSBU, and across different search engines including MeroX, xiSearch, and pLink. Using a published dataset originated from synthetic peptides, we demonstrate that STY-cross-links indeed have a high false discovery rate. Further analysis revealed that depending on the data and the CXMS search engine used to analyze the data, up to 65% of the STY-cross-links identified are actually K-K cross-links of the same peptide pairs, up to 61% are actually K-mono-links, and the rest tend to contain short peptides at high risk of false identification.",

    "abstract": "The DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination are formed by an evolutionarily conserved suite of factors that includes Rec114 and Mei4 (RM), which regulate DSB formation both spatially and temporally. In vivo, these proteins form large immunostaining foci that are integrated with higher order chromosome structures. In vitro, they form a 2:1 heterotrimeric complex that binds cooperatively to DNA to form large, dynamic condensates. However, understanding of the atomic structures and dynamic DNA binding properties of RM complexes is lacking. Here, we report a structural model of a heterotrimeric complex of the C-terminus of Rec114 with the N-terminus of Mei4, supported by nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. This minimal complex, which lacks the predicted intrinsically disordered region of Rec114, is sufficient to bind DNA and form condensates. Single-molecule experiments reveal that the minimal complex can bridge two or more DNA duplexes and can generate force to condense DNA through long-range interactions. AlphaFold2 predicts similar structural models for RM orthologs across diverse taxa despite their low degree of sequence similarity. These findings provide insight into the conserved networks of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that enable condensate formation and promote formation of meiotic DSBs.",

    "abstract": "Well-characterized and scalable downstream process for purification of biologics is extremely demanding for delivering quality therapeutics to patients at a reasonable price. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a blockbuster biologic with diverse clinical applications but its application is limited to financially well-off societies due to high price. The high price of EPO is associated with the technical difficulties related to the purification challenge to obtain qualified product with a cost-effective defined process. Though there are reports for purification of EPO but there is no report of well-characterized downstream process with critical process parameters (CPPs) that can deliver EPO consistently satisfying the quality target product profile (QTPP), which is a critical regulatory requirement. To advance the field, we applied quality by design (QbD) principle and design of experiment (DoE) protocol to establish an effective process, which is scalable up to 100x batch size satisfying QTPP. We have successfully transformed the process from static mode to dynamic mode and validated. Insignificant variation (p> 0.05) within and between 1x, 10x and 100x batches showed that the process is reproducible and seamlessly scalable. The biochemical analysis along with the biofunctionality data ensures that the products from different-scale batches were indifferent and comparable to a reference product. Our study thereby established a robust and scalable downstream process of EPO biosimilar satisfying QTPP. The technological scheme presented here can speed-up the production of not only EPO but many other life-saving biologics and make them available to mass population at a reduced cost.",

    "abstract": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) accounts for 75% of kidney cancers. Due to the high recurrence rate, and treatment options that come with high costs and potential side effects correct prognosis of patient survival is essential for the successful and effective treatment of patients. Novel biomarkers could play an important role in the assessment of the overall survival of patients. COL7A1 encodes for collagen type VII, a constituent of the basal membrane. COL7A1 is associated with survival in many cancers; however, the prognostic value of COL7A1 expression as a standalone biomarker in ccRCC has not been investigated. We used Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards model to investigate the prognostic value of COL7A1, as well as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to investigate genes that are co-expressed with COL7A1. COL7A1 expression was used to stratify patients into four groups of expression, where the 5-year survival probability of each group was 72.4%, 59.1%, 34.15%, and 8.6% in order of increasing expression. Additionally, COL7A1 expression was successfully used to further divide patients of each stage and histological grade into groups of high and low risk. Similar results were obtained in independent cohorts. In-vitro knockdown of COL7A1 expression significantly impacted ccRCC cells ability to migrate and proliferate. To conclude, we identified COL7A1 as a new prognosis marker that can stratify ccRCC patients.",

    "abstract": "Prokaryotes, known as carbon monoxide (CO) oxidizers, use CO as the carbon or energy source with CO dehydrogenases (CODHs), which are divided into nickel-containing CODH (Ni-CODH) that are sensitive to O2 and molybdenum-containing CODH (Mo-CODH) that are capable of aerobic functioning. The oxygen conditions for CO oxidizers to oxidize CO may be limited because CO oxidizers isolated and characterized so far have either Ni- or Mo-CODH. Here, we report a novel CO oxidizer capable of CO oxidation with both types of CODH based on genomic and physiological characterization of the isolate Parageobacillus sp. G301. This thermophilic facultative anaerobic Bacillota bacterium was isolated from the sediment of a freshwater lake. Genomic analyses showed that G301 was the only isolate possessing both Ni-CODH and Mo-CODH. Genome-based reconstruction of the respiratory machinery and physiological investigation indicated that CO oxidation by Ni-CODH was coupled with H2 production (proton reduction), and CO oxidation by Mo-CODH was coupled with O2 reduction under aerobic conditions and nitrate reduction under anaerobic conditions. G301 would thus be able to thrive via CO oxidation under a wide range of conditions, from aerobic environments to anaerobic environments even without terminal electron acceptors other than protons. As comparative genome analyses revealed no significant differences in genome structures and encoded cellular functions, except for CO oxidation between CO oxidizers and non-CO oxidizers in the genus Parageobacillus, CO oxidation genes would be retained exclusively for CO metabolism and related respiration.\n\nImportanceMicrobial CO oxidation has received a lot of attention because it contributes to global carbon cycling in addition to functioning as a remover of CO, which is toxic to many organisms. Microbial CO oxidizers have a punctate phylogenetic distribution throughout bacteria and archaea, even in genus-level monophyletic groups. In this study, we demonstrated that the new isolate Parageobacillus sp. G301 is capable of both anaerobic (hydrogenogenic) and aerobic CO oxidation, which had not been previously reported. The discovery of this new isolate, which is versatile in CO metabolism, would accelerate research into such CO oxidizers with diverse CO metabolisms, expanding our understanding of microbial diversity. Through comparative genomic analyses, we propose that CO oxidation genes are optional but not essential genetic elements in the genus Parageobacillus, providing insight into a factor that shapes the mosaic phylogenetic distribution of CO oxidizers, even in genus-level monophyletic groups.",

The relative expression of the gene cluster involved in nisin production was evaluated using qPCR analysis. Additionally, a series of re-transformations of the strain introducing multi copies of the nisA and nisRK genes involved in nisin biosynthesis were developed. The simultaneous expression of nisA and nisZ genes was used to potentiate the effective inhibition of foodborne pathogens. Further, qPCR analysis revealed a low expression of the nisA and nisRK genes in wild-type L. lactis subsp. lactis. After several re-transformations of the strain with the nisA and nisRK genes, a high expression of these genes was obtained, contributing to improved nisin production.

    "abstract": "ObjectivesEpithelial colonisation is a critical first step in bacterial pathogenesis. Staphylococcus aureus can utilise several host factors to associate with cells, including 5{beta}l integrin and heparan sulphate proteoglycans, such as the syndecans. Here, we demonstrate that a partner protein of both integrins and syndecans, the host membrane adapter protein tetraspanin CD9, is essential for syndecan-mediated staphylococcal adhesion. Fibronectin is also essential in this process while integrins are only critical for post-adhesion entry into human epithelial cells.\n\nMethods and ResultsTreatment of epithelial cells with CD9-derived peptide or heparin caused significant reductions in staphylococcal adherence, dependent on both CD9 and syndecan-1. Exogenous fibronectin caused a CD9-dependent increase in staphylococcal adhesion whereas blockade of {beta}1 integrins did not affect adhesion but did reduce the subsequent internalisation of adhered bacteria. CD9 disruption or deletion increased {beta}1 integrin-mediated internalisation, suggesting that CD9 coordinates sequential staphylococcal adhesion and internalisation.\n\nConclusionsCD9 controls staphylococcal adhesion through syndecan-1, using a mechanism that likely requires CD9-mediated syndecan organisation to correctly display fibronectin at the host cell surface. We propose that CD9-derived peptides or heparin analogues could be developed as anti-adhesion treatments to inhibit the initial stages of staphylococcal pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) is the most prevalent mosquito-borne virus in the United States with approximately 2,000 cases each year. There are currently no approved human vaccines and a lack of prophylactic and therapeutic treatments. Understanding host responses to infection may reveal potential intervention targets to reduce virus replication and disease progression. The use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to understand innate immunity and host antiviral responses is well established. Previous studies revealed that insulin-mediated signaling regulates WNV infection in invertebrates by regulating canonical antiviral pathways. Because insulin signaling is well-conserved across insect and mammalian species, we sought to determine if results using D. melanogaster can be extrapolated for the analysis of orthologous pathways in humans. Here, we identify insulin-mediated endothelin signaling using the D. melanogaster model and evaluate an orthologous pathway in human cells during WNV infection. We demonstrate that endothelin signaling reduces WNV replication through the activation of canonical antiviral signaling. Taken together, our findings show that endothelin-mediated antiviral immunity is broadly conserved across species and reduces replication of viruses that can cause severe human disease.\n\nIMPORTANCEArboviruses, particularly those transmitted by mosquitoes, pose a significant threat to humans and are an increasing concern because of climate change, human activity, and expanding vector-competent populations. West Nile virus is of significant concern as the most frequent mosquito-borne disease transmitted annually within the continental United States. Here, we identify a previously uncharacterized signaling pathway that impacts West Nile virus infection, namely endothelin signaling. Additionally, we demonstrate that we can successfully translate results obtained from D. melanogaster into the more relevant human system. Our results add to the growing field of insulin-mediated antiviral immunity and identifies potential biomarkers or intervention targets to better address West Nile virus infection and severe disease.",

However, the full complement of proteins enriched in BR-bodies has not been defined. Here we define the protein components of BR-bodies through enrichment of the bodies followed by mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. We found 111 BR-body enriched proteins, including several RNA binding proteins, many of which are also recruited directly to in vitro reconstituted RNase E droplets, showing BR-bodies are more complex than previously assumed. While most BR-body enriched proteins that were tested cannot phase separate, we identified five that undergo RNA-dependent phase separation in vitro, showing other RNP condensates interface with BR-bodies. RNA degradosome protein clients are recruited more strongly to RNase E droplets than droplets of other RNP condensates, implying that client specificity is largely achieved through direct protein-protein interactions. We observe that some RNP condensates assemble with preferred directionally, suggesting that RNA may be trafficked through RNP condensates in an ordered manner to facilitate mRNA processing/decay, and that some BR-body associated proteins have the capacity to dissolve the condensate. Finally, we find that RNA dramatically stimulates the rate of RNase E phase separation in vitro, explaining the dissolution of BR-bodies after cellular mRNA depletion observed previously. Altogether, these results suggest that a complex network of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions controls BR-body phase separation and RNA processing.\n\nHighlightsO_LIBR-body proteomics identified 111 proteins enriched in BR-bodies.\nC_LIO_LIBR-bodies associate with an interconnected network of RNP condensates.\nC_LIO_LIBR-body condensation is modulated by its interaction network.\nC_LIO_LIRNA is required for rapid BR-body condensation.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical AbstractSummary of the BR-body protein interactome.

    "abstract": "The CTLH complex is a multi-subunit ubiquitin ligase complex that recognizes substrates with Pro/N-degrons via the substrate receptor GID4. Recently, focus has turned to this complex as a potential mediator of targeted protein degradation, but the role GID4-mediated substrate ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation plays in humans has thus far remained unclear. Here, we report PFI-7, a potent, selective, and cell-active chemical probe that antagonizes Pro/N-degron binding to human GID4. Use of PFI-7 in proximity-dependent biotinylation enabled the identification of dozens of endogenous GID4-interacting proteins that bind via the GID4 substrate binding pocket, only a subset of which possess canonical Pro/N-degron sequences. GID4 interactors are enriched for nuclear and nucleolar proteins including RNA helicases. GID4 antagonism by PFI-7 altered protein levels of several proteins including RNA helicases as measured by label-free quantitative proteomics, defining proteins that are regulated by GID4 and the CTLH complex in humans. Interactions with GID4 via Pro/N-degron pathway did not result in proteasomal degradation, demonstrating that CTLH interactors are regulated through a combination of degradative and non-degradative functions. The lack of degradation of GID4 interactors highlights potential challenges in utilizing GID4-recruiting bifunctional molecules for targeted protein degradation. Going forward, PFI-7 will be a valuable research tool for defining CTLH complex biology and honing targeted protein degradation strategies.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and the resulting cardiac remodeling is a common cause of heart failure. The RNA binding protein Human Antigen R (HuR) has been previously shown to reduce cardiac remodeling following both I/R and cardiac pressure overload, but the full extent of the HuR-dependent mechanisms within cells of the myocardium have yet to be elucidated. In this study, we applied a novel small molecule inhibitor of HuR to define the functional role of HuR in the acute response to I/R injury and gain a better understanding of the HuR-dependent mechanisms during post-ischemic myocardial remodeling. Our results show an early (two hours post-I/R) increase in HuR activity that is necessary for early inflammatory gene expression by cardiomyocytes in response to I/R. Surprisingly, despite the reductions in early inflammatory gene expression at two hours post-I/R, HuR inhibition has no effect on initial infarct size at 24-hours post-I/R. However, in agreement with previously published work, we do see a reduction in pathological remodeling and preserved cardiac function at two weeks post-I/R upon HuR inhibition. RNA-sequencing analysis of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) at two hours post-LPS treatment to model damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP)-mediated activation of toll like receptors (TLRs) demonstrates a broad HuR-dependent regulation of pro-inflammatory chemokine and cytokine gene expression in cardiomyocytes. We show that conditioned media from NRVMs pre-treated with HuR inhibitor loses the ability to induce inflammatory gene expression in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) compared to NRVMs treated with LPS alone. Functionally, HuR inhibition in NRVMs also reduces their ability to induce endocrine migration of peripheral blood monocytes in vitro and reduces post-ischemic macrophage infiltration to the heart in vivo. In summary, these results suggest a HuR-dependent expression of pro-inflammatory gene expression by cardiomyocytes that leads to subsequent monocyte recruitment and macrophage activation in the post-ischemic myocardium.",

    "abstract": "Cell autonomous responses to intracellular bacteria largely depend on gene expression reorganization. To gain isoform-level resolution into these regulations, we combined long- and short- read transcriptomic analysis of the response of intestinal epithelial cells to infection by the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). Expression of the cellular stress response regulator CIRBP (cold-inducible RNA-binding protein) switched from a canonical transcript to a nonsense-mediated decay-sensitive isoform. Permeation of host cell membranes by bacterial pore-forming toxins such as Lm-secreted listeriolysin O drove CIRBP alternative splicing via CLK1 inhibition and dephosphorylation of serine/arginine-rich (SR) splicing factors, similarly to a previously reported pathway upon heat stress. Selective repression of canonical CIRBP dampened infection while that of the alternative isoform exacerbated it. Consistently, CIRBP-bound RNA targets were shifted towards stress-relevant transcripts upon infection. CIRBP alternative splicing can thus be generalized as a common response to biotic or abiotic stresses also relevant in the context of bacterial infection.",

    "abstract": "DNA-targeting drugs may damage DNA or chromatin. Many anti-cancer drugs damage both, making it difficult to understand their mechanisms of action. Using molecules causing DNA breaks without altering nucleosome structure (bleomycin) or destabilizing nucleosomes without damaging DNA (curaxin), we investigated the consequences of DNA or chromatin damage in normal and tumor cells. As expected, DNA damage caused p53-dependent growth arrest followed by senescence. Chromatin damage caused higher p53 accumulation than DNA damage; however, growth arrest was p53-independent and did not result in senescence. Chromatin damage activated the transcription of multiple genes, including classical p53 targets, in a p53-independent manner. Although these genes were not highly expressed in basal conditions, they had chromatin organization around the transcription start sites (TSS) characteristic of most highly expressed genes and the highest level of paused RNA polymerase. We hypothesized that nucleosomes around the TSS of these genes were the most sensitive to chromatin damage. Therefore, nucleosome loss upon curaxin treatment would enable transcription without the assistance of sequence-specific transcription factors. We confirmed this hypothesis by showing greater nucleosome loss around the TSS of these genes upon curaxin treatment and activation of a p53-specific reporter in p53-null cells by chromatin-damaging agents but not DNA-damaging agents.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) removes damaged and unwanted proteins by attaching ubiquitin to lysines in a process termed ubiquitination. Little is known how functional components of the UPS, often exposed to erroneous labeling by ubiquitin during functioning, avoid premature proteolysis. An extensive lysine-less region (lysine desert) in the yeast E3 ligase Slx5 was shown to counteract its ubiquitin-dependent turnover. We conducted bioinformatic screens among prokaryotes and eukaryotes to describe the scope and conservation of this phenomenon. We found that lysine deserts are widespread among bacteria using pupylation-dependent proteasomal degradation, an analog of the UPS. In eukaryotes, lysine deserts appear with increasing organismal complexity, and the most evolutionarily conserved are enriched in the UPS members. Using VHL and SOCS1 E3 ligases, which elongate their lysine desert in the course of evolution, we established that they are non-lysine ubiquitinated, which does not influence their stability, and can be subject to proteasome turnover irrespective of ubiquitination. Our data suggest that a combination of non-lysine ubiquitination and ubiquitin-independent degradation may control the function and fate of the lysine-deficient proteome, as the presence of lysine deserts does not correlate with the half-life.",

    "abstract": "Sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) is an economically important coniferous tree in Japan. However, abundant sugi pollen grains are dispersed and transported by the wind each spring and cause a severe pollen allergy syndrome (Japanese cedar pollinosis). The use of pollen-free sugi that cannot produce pollen has been thought as a countermeasure to Japanese cedar pollinosis. The sugi CjACOS5 gene is an ortholog of Arabidopsis ACOS5 and rice OsACOS12, which encode an acyl-CoA synthetase that is involved in the synthesis of sporopollenin in pollen walls. To generate pollen-free sugi, we mutated CjACOS5 using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. As a result of sugi transformation mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens harboring the CjACOS5-targeted CRISPR/Cas9 vector, 1 bp-deleted homo biallelic mutant lines were obtained. Chimeric mutant lines harboring both mutant and wild-type CjACOS5 genes were also generated. The homo biallelic mutant lines had no-pollen in male strobili, whereas chimeric mutant lines had male strobili with or without pollen grains. Our results suggest that CjACOS5 is essential for the production of pollen in sugi and that its disruption is useful for the generation of pollen-free sugi. In addition to conventional transgenic technology, genome editing technology, including CRISPR/Cas9, can confer new traits on sugi.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) peptides in intra- and extracellular deposits. How A{beta} aggregates perturb the proteome in brains of patients and AD transgenic mouse models, however, remains largely unclear. State-of-the-art mass spectrometry (MS) methods can comprehensively detect proteomic alterations in neurodegenerative disorders, providing relevant insights unobtainable with transcriptomics investigations. Analyses of the relationship between progressive A{beta} aggregation and protein abundance changes in brains of 5xFAD transgenic mice have not been reported previously.\n\nMethodsWe quantified progressive A{beta} aggregation in hippocampus and cortex of 5xFAD mice and controls with immunohistochemistry and biochemical membrane filter assays. Protein changes in different mouse tissues were analysed by MS-based proteomics using label-free quantification (LFQ); resulting MS data were processed using an established pipeline. Results were contrasted with existing proteomic data sets from postmortem AD patient brains. Finally, abundance changes in the candidate marker Arl8b were validated in CSF from AD patients and controls using ELISAs.\n\nResultsExperiments revealed a more rapid accumulation of A{beta}42 peptides in hippocampus than in cortex of 5xFAD mice, accompanied by many more protein abundance changes in hippocampus than in cortex, indicating that A{beta}42 aggregate deposition is associated with brain region-specific proteome perturbations. Generating time-resolved data sets, we defined A{beta} aggregate-correlated and anticorrelated proteome changes, a fraction of which was conserved in postmortem AD patient brain tissue, suggesting that proteome changes in 5xFAD mice mimic disease relevant changes in human AD. We detected a positive correlation between A{beta}42 aggregate deposition in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice and the abundance of the lysosome-associated small GTPase Arl8b, which accumulated together with axonal lysosomal membranes in close proximity of extracellular A{beta} plaques in 5xFAD brains. Abnormal aggregation of Arl8b was observed in AD brain tissue. Arl8b protein levels were significantly increased in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients, a clinically accessible body fluid.\n\nConclusionsWe report a comprehensive biochemical and proteomic investigation of hippocampal and cortical brain tissue derived from 5xFAD transgenic mice, providing a valuable resource to the neuroscientific community. We identified Arl8b, with significant abundance changes in 5xFAD and AD patient brains. Arl8b might enable the measurement of progressive lysosome accumulation in AD patients and have clinical utility as a candidate biomarker.\n\nData are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD030348.",

    "abstract": "Williams Syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder exhibiting cognitive and behavioral abnormalities, including increased social motivation, risk of anxiety and specific phobias along with perturbed motor function. Williams Syndrome is caused by a microdeletion of 26-28 genes on chromosome 7, including GTF2IRD1, which encodes a transcription factor suggested to play a role in the behavioral profile of Williams Syndrome. Duplications of the full region also lead to frequent autism diagnosis, social phobias, and language delay. Thus, genes in the region appear to regulate social motivation in a dose-sensitive manner. A  Complete Deletion mouse, heterozygously eliminating the syntenic Williams Syndrome region, has been deeply characterized for cardiac phenotypes, but direct measures of social motivation have not been assessed. Furthermore, the role of Gtf2ird1 in these behaviors has not been addressed in a relevant genetic context. Here, we have generated a mouse overexpressing Gtf2ird1, which can be used both to model duplication of this gene alone and to rescue Gtf2ird1 expression in the Complete Deletion mice. Using a comprehensive behavioral pipeline and direct measures of social motivation, we provide evidence that the Williams Syndrome Critical Region regulates social motivation along with motor and anxiety phenotypes, but that Gtf2ird1 complementation is not sufficient to rescue most of these traits, and duplication does not decrease social motivation. However, Gtf2ird1 complementation does rescue light-aversive behavior and performance on select sensorimotor tasks, perhaps indicating a role for this gene in sensory processing or integration.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) differentiation protocols, different methods to create in-vitro human-derived neuronal networks have been proposed. Although monolayer cultures represent a valid model, adding three-dimensionality would make them more representative of an in-vivo environment. Thus, human-derived neurospheroids and brain-organoids are becoming increasingly used for in-vitro disease modeling. Achieving control over the final cell composition and investigating the exhibited electrophysiological activity is still a challenge. Thence, platforms capable of measuring and characterizing the functional aspects of these samples are needed. Here, we propose a method to rapid generate neurospheroids of human origin with control over cell composition that can be used for functional investigations. We show a characterization of the electrophysiological activity exhibited by the neurospheroids by presenting for the first-time results from the main micro-electrodes arrays (MEAs) types available on the market (passive electrode, C-MOS electrodes, 3D electrodes). Neurospheroids grown in free culture and transferred on MEA exhibited functional activity that can be chemically and electrically modulated. Our results indicates that this model holds great potential for in-depth study of signal transmission to drug screening, disease modeling and offers a reproducible and stable platform for in-vitro functional testing.",

    "abstract": "In order to survive and adapt in a dynamic environment, animals must perceive and remember the temporal structure of events and actions across a wide range of timescales. Prior research to investigate the neurobiological basis underlying so-called interval timing (i.e. timing on the scale of second to minutes) has focused largely on simple timing tasks that require animals to discriminate and/or reproduce stimuli presented at single, fixed durations over thousands of trials. Perhaps not surprisingly, this work has uncovered circuits involved in procedural memory systems, such as the basal ganglia, that play a key role in learning and driving timing behavior. Episodic memory (i.e. the ability to remember specific, personal events that occur in spatial and temporal context) also requires accurate temporal processing and is known to require neural circuits in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), including entorhinal cortex. However, a clear role for medial temporal lobe structures in interval timing has been conspicuously lacking. In order to determine the specific role that MTL structures play in timing behavior, we developed a novel behavioral paradigm that requires learning complex temporal contingencies. Applying this novel interval timing task in mice, in concert with methods for manipulating neural activity and methods for large-scale cellular resolution neurophysiological recording, we have uncovered a specific role for medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) in flexible, context-dependent learning of interval timing behavior. We find neurons in MEC, termed time cells, fire in regular time-locked sequences during timing. Remarkably, over the course of learning, these neural dynamics become context-dependent with specific sub-populations of neurons becoming selectively active within particular trial contexts. We also find that this neural activity is disrupted when animals make errors in their timing behavior and that animals are completely unable to learn this timing behavior without MEC activity. Further, we find that MEC activity is not necessary for very rigid forms of timing behavior and that nearby structures, such as the hippocampus, are not necessary for learning this flexible timing task. Finally, the results identify the particular cognitive strategy employed by the animal to discriminate contexts that contain more complex temporal structure, that often exist in nature. Together these results establish a precise role of MEC in learning flexible timing behavior and demonstrate that learning is driven by context-dependent sequential neural dynamics of MEC time cells.",

    "abstract": "Subthreshold depolarization enhances neurotransmitter release evoked by action potentials and plays a key role in modulating synaptic transmission by combining analog and digital signals. This process is known to be Ca2+-dependent. However, the underlying mechanism of how small changes in basal Ca2+ caused by subthreshold depolarization can regulate transmitter release triggered by a large increase in local Ca2+ is not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the source and signaling mechanisms of Ca2+ that couple subthreshold depolarization with the enhancement of glutamate release in hippocampal cultures and CA3 pyramidal neurons. Subthreshold depolarization increased presynaptic Ca2+ levels, the frequency of spontaneous release, and the amplitude of evoked release, all of which were abolished by blocking L-type Ca2+ channels. A high concentration of intracellular Ca2+ buffer or blockade of calmodulin and phospholipase C abolished depolarization induced increases in transmitter release. Estimation of the readily releasable pool size using hypertonic sucrose showed depolarization induced increases in readily releasable pool size, and this increase was abolished by blockade of calmodulin or phospholipase C. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the modulation of transmitter release by subthreshold potential change and highlight the role of L-type Ca2+ channels in coupling subthreshold depolarization to the activation of Ca2+-dependent signaling molecules that regulate transmitter release.\n\nSIGNIFICANCENeuronal activities are encoded by action potentials, but subthreshold changes in resting membrane potentials also play important roles in regulating neuronal functions including synaptic transmission. It is, however, poorly understood how small changes in basal Ca2+ induced by subthreshold depolarization regulate transmitter release triggered by a large increase in local Ca2+ in presynaptic terminals. We demonstrate that L-type Ca2+ channels are the major source of presynaptic Ca2+ influx at basal state and during subthreshold depolarization, resulting in the activation of signaling molecules such as calmodulin and phospholipase C, which facilitate transmitter release by increasing both release probability and the readily releasable pool size. Our results provide mechanistic insight into how subthreshold potential changes contribute to regulating transmitter release.",

While in other brain areas FFI underlies a precise excitation vs inhibition temporal correlation, recent findings in the cerebellum highlighted more complex behaviors at the granule cell (GC) - molecular layer interneuron (MLI) - Purkinje cell (PC) FFI pathway. To dissect the temporal organization of the cerebellar FFI pathway, we combined ex vivo patch clamp recordings of PCs with a viral-based strategy to express Channelrhodopsin2 in a subset of mossy fibers (MFs), a major excitatory input to GCs. We show that light-mediated MF activation elicits excitatory and inhibitory currents in PCs with a wide range of temporal delays. Furthermore, in many recordings, excitation and inhibition were initiated by different groups of GCs, expanding PCs synaptic temporal integration. Using a computational model of the FFI pathway we demonstrated that this temporal expansion could strongly influence how PCs integrate MF inputs. Our findings suggest that MF inputs are also encoded by specific delays between excitation and inhibition in PCs.",

    "abstract": "ImportanceThe lack of robust neuroanatomical markers of psychosis risk has been traditionally attributed to heterogeneity. A complementary hypothesis is that variation in neuroanatomical measures in the majority of individuals at psychosis risk may be nested within the range observed in healthy individuals.\n\nObjectiveTo quantify deviations from the normative range of neuroanatomical variation in individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P) and evaluate their overlap with healthy variation and their association with positive symptoms, cognition, and conversion to a psychotic disorder.\n\nDesign, Setting, and ParticipantsClinical, IQ and FreeSurfer-derived regional measures of cortical thickness (CT), cortical surface area (SA), and subcortical volume (SV) from 1,340 CHR-P individuals [47.09% female; mean age: 20.75 (4.74) years] and 1,237 healthy individuals [44.70% female; mean age: 22.32 (4.95) years] from 29 international sites participating in the ENIGMA Clinical High Risk for Psychosis Working Group.\n\nMain Outcomes and MeasuresFor each regional morphometric measure, z-scores were computed that index the degree of deviation from the normative means of that measure in a healthy reference population (N=37,407). Average deviation scores (ADS) for CT, SA, SV, and globally across all measures (G) were generated by averaging the respective regional z-scores. Regression analyses were used to quantify the association of deviation scores with clinical severity and cognition and two-proportion z-tests to identify case-control differences in the proportion of individuals with infranormal (z<-1.96) or supranormal (z>1.96) scores.\n\nResultsCHR-P and healthy individuals overlapped in the distributions of the observed values, regional z-scores, and all ADS vales. The proportion of CHR-P individuals with infranormal or supranormal values in any metric was low (<12%) and similar to that of healthy individuals. CHR-P individuals who converted to psychosis compared to those who did not convert had a higher percentage of infranormal values in temporal regions (5-7% vs 0.9-1.4%). In the CHR-P group, only the ADSSA showed significant but weak associations (|{beta}|<0.09; PFDR<0.05) with positive symptoms and IQ.\n\nConclusions and RelevanceThe study findings challenge the usefulness of macroscale neuromorphometric measures as diagnostic biomarkers of psychosis risk and suggest that such measures do not provide an adequate explanation for psychosis risk.\n\nKey pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs the risk of psychosis associated with brain morphometric changes that deviate significantly from healthy variation?\n\nFindingsIn this study of 1340 individuals high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P) and 1237 healthy participants, individual-level variation in macroscale neuromorphometric measures of the CHR-P group was largely nested within healthy variation and was not associated with the severity of positive psychotic symptoms or conversion to a psychotic disorder.\n\nMeaningThe findings suggest the macroscale neuromorphometric measures have limited utility as diagnostic biomarkers of psychosis risk.",

    "abstract": "The basolateral amygdala (BLA) projects widely across the macaque frontal cortex1-4, and amygdalo-frontal projections are critical for optimal emotional responding5 and decision- making6. Yet, little is known about the single-neuron architecture of these projections: namely, whether single BLA neurons project to multiple parts of the frontal cortex. Here, we use MAPseq7 to determine the projection patterns of over 3000 macaque BLA neurons. We found that one-third of BLA neurons have two or more distinct targets in parts of frontal cortex and of subcortical structures. Further, we reveal non-random structure within these branching patterns such that neurons with four targets are more frequently observed than those with two or three, indicative of widespread networks. Consequently, these multi-target single neurons form distinct networks within medial and ventral frontal cortex consistent with their known functions in regulating mood and decision-making. Additionally, we show that branching patterns of single neurons shape functional networks in the brain as assessed by fMRI-based functional connectivity. These results provide a neuroanatomical basis for the role of the BLA in coordinating brain-wide responses to valent stimuli8 and highlight the importance of high- resolution neuroanatomical data for understanding functional networks in the brain.",
