    "abstract": "Perineuronal nets (PNNs) surround specific neurons in the brain and are involved in various forms of plasticity and clinical conditions. However, our understanding of the PNN role in these phenomena is limited by the lack of highly quantitative maps of PNN distribution and association with specific cell types. Here, we present the first comprehensive atlas of PNN distribution (in Allen Brain Atlas coordinates) and colocalization with parvalbumin (PV) cells for over 600 regions of the adult mouse brain. Data analysis showed that PV expression is a good predictor of PNN aggregation. In the cortex, PNNs are dramatically enriched in layer 4 of all primary sensory areas in correlation with thalamocortical input density, and their distribution mirrors intracortical connectivity patterns. Gene expression analysis identified many PNN correlated genes. Strikingly, PNN anticorrelated transcripts were enriched in synaptic plasticity genes, generalizing PNN role as circuit stability factors. Overall, this atlas offers novel resources for understanding the organizational principles of the brain extracellular matrix.",

    "abstract": "Animals improve fitness by choosing when and where to disperse in the environment using sensory cues. In freshwater habitats subject to flood and drought, dispersal can urgently challenge newly hatched fish. Here we manipulated rearing environment and sensory systems to reveal an adaptive sensorimotor strategy for dispersal. If we constrained hatchlings or blocked feedback about motion by simultaneously impairing the lateral line and vision, they gulped air and elevated their buoyancy to passively sail on faster surface waters. In stagnant water, hatchlings then covered more ground with hyperstable swimming, tightly steering based on graviception. In hydrodynamic simulations, these adaptations nearly tripled diffusivity and made dispersal robust to local conditions. Through combined use of three senses, hatchlings adapt their behavior to flexibly and efficiently disperse.",

    "abstract": "Context for and purposeRetrieval of modern and ancient environmental DNA (eDNA) from sediments has revolutionized our ability to reconstruct present and past ecosystems. Little emphasis has been placed, however, on the fundamentals of the DNA-sediment associations and, consequently, our understanding of taphonomy and provenance of eDNA in sediments remains extremely limited. If we are to be able to accurately infer community dynamics across time and space from eDNA data, we need to understand how depositional processes and sedimentary associations of DNA molecules in different settings influence our interpretation.\n\nApproach and methodsHere, we introduce interfacial geochemical principles to the field of eDNA and discuss current interpretational biases. We outline a way to increase the scope and resolution of ecological interpretations from eDNA by combining mineralogic composition with experimental adsorption data. We apply distribution coefficients to assess the relationship between the DNA fraction in water columns and DNA fraction sequestered by suspended sediment particles. We further evaluate the challenges with drawing ecological inference using eDNA from sedimentary systems that receive input from different ecosystem types as a consequence of sedimentary processes.\n\nMain results: We show thatO_LIThe retention of DNA in aqueous environments depends on the mineralogy of sediment particles and on the number of particles loaded in the water column.\nC_LIO_LIDNA attached to sediment particles from distal systems can be deposited in proximal systems and skew the interpretation of the proximal sediment samples.\nC_LIO_LIHigh particle loading in the water column can deplete suspended DNA and cause inaccurate interpretation of aqueous DNA samples.\nC_LIO_LIHigh particle loading in surface sediment pore waters enhances sequestration of DNA from benthic communities relative to that of water column communities, resulting in skewed estimates of species richness and abundance from sedimentary DNA.\nC_LI\n\nWe discuss how to integrate taphonomy and provenance knowledge into the reconstruction of modern and past ecosystems, and ecosystem monitoring from eDNA data.\n\nConclusions and the wider implicationsOur findings demonstrate that integrating information about eDNA taphonomy and provenance into modern and past ecosystem reconstruction from eDNA data can enhance the scope, resolution and accuracy of our interpretations.",

Therefore, in this study, we have first generated MSCs and endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) from mice bone marrow by in house optimized protocol and then 3-D co-cultured them with mice islets. Secretion of in the culture supernatant suggested the pro-angiogenic nature of 3D cultured mice islets. After 5 days post-tx of these pro-angiogenic islets in the omental pouch of syngeneic mice led to: 1) restoration of normoglycemia, 2) secretion of mouse C-peptide and 3) induction of angiogenic factors after 3 days of post-tx. The induction of angiogenic factors was done by RT-qPCR of omental biopsies. Importantly, pro-angiogenic islet recipient mice also demonstrated the clearance of glucose within 75 min, reflecting their efficient function and engraftment. Our results highlights needs of 3-D co-culture islets for superior quality post-tx islet vasculature and better engraftment - crux to improvise the challenges associated with post-tx islet vascularization and functions.",

    "abstract": "Faithful mimics of tuberculosis (TB) infection are needed to provide mechanistic insights into the complex host-pathogen interactions and accelerate drug discovery. Current in vitro models only allow short investigation durations, present divergent transcriptional signatures to human infections, and are unreliable drug discovery platforms. We developed a 3D collagen culture system mimicking the lung microenvironment (collagen fibres, pore size and stiffness), where we incorporated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infected human THP-1 or primary monocytes. Dual RNA-sequencing revealed high mammalian gene expression similarity with patient samples compared to 2D macrophage infections. Similarly, gene expression of bacteria was much more representative to in vivo gene expression compared to bacteria in 2D cultures (114 genes in 3D vs 21 genes in 2D). Key phenotypes observed in humans, such as foamy macrophages and mycobacterial cords (never seen in any other in vitro culture system), were reproduced in our model. Our system overcomes many challenges associated with the traditional platforms, including showing remarkable efficacy with clinically relevant concentrations of first-line anti-TB drug pyrazinamide, not seen in any other in vitro model, making it reliable, readily adoptable for tuberculosis studies and drug screening.\n\nSignificance statementMtb is a slow-growing pathogen which modulates host response over time. The current in vitro platforms offer a very short study duration to study, are unreliable as drug discovery platforms, and the phenotypic and genotypic traits of the host and pathogen differ. The collagen-I hydrogel culture system developed in this study addresses these challenges by successfully recapitulating several key phenotypes observed in human infections. Dual RNA sequence also showed excellent gene expression similarities for both the host and the bacteria. Furthermore, remarkable efficacy with the antibiotic Pyrazinamide was demonstrated, a first for in vitro cultures despite over 50 years of clinical use of the drug. We expect our platform to be exploited widely for drug discovery and understanding host-pathogen interactions.",

    "abstract": "The growth and proliferation of mutant astrocyte cells are widely known characteristics in high grade glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) neurological cancers. The infiltrative tumor processes during glioblastoma development follow predefined routes and patterns dictated by biochemical and physiological environments in the brain. Specifically, at the cellular-level the glioblastoma-related astrocytes cells typically are occluded along neural fissures, neurophysiological interfaces as well as along available blood vessel routes for sources of nutrients to drive overall tumor tissue growth and development. Additionally, each individual astrocyte cell maintains a predisposition to aggregate into a supracellular aggregate with organioid-like properties. Here in this work, we attempt to understand the physical processes involved at the single cell level in forming these pre-tumor states and investigate the environmental forces that may perturb the formation of intermediate cellular assemblies in order to ultimately perturb overall tumor growth and development processes.",

Gene co-expression estimation is an essential step in this direction. It can annotate functionalities of unknown genes or construct the basis of gene regulatory network inference. This study thoroughly tests the existing gene co-expression estimation methods on simulation datasets with known ground truth co-expression networks. We generate these novel datasets using two simulation processes that use the parameters learned from the experimental data. We demonstrate that these simulations better capture the underlying properties of the real-world single-cell datasets than previously tested simulations for the task. Our performance results on tens of simulated and eight experimental datasets show that all methods produce estimations with a high false discovery rate potentially caused by high-sparsity levels in the data. Finally, we find that commonly used pre-processing approaches, such as normalization and imputation, do not improve the co-expression estimation. Overall, our benchmark setup contributes to the co-expression estimator development, and our study provides valuable insights for the community of single-cell data analyses.",

However, methods for inferring and aligning such sequences in annotated genomes have not kept pace with the increasing scale and complexity of the available data. Thus, in this work we implemented several improvements to the traditional methodology that more fully leverage the redundancy of closely related genomes and the organization of their annotations. Two highlights include the application of the more flexible k-clique percolation algorithm for identifying clusters of orthologous proteins and the development of a novel technique for removing poorly supported regions of alignments with a phylogenetic HMM. In making the latter, we also wrote a fully documented Python package Homomorph that implements standard HMM algorithms and created a set of tutorials to promote its use by a wide audience. We applied the resulting pipeline to a set of 33 annotated Drosophila genomes, generating 22,813 orthologous groups and 8,566 high-quality alignments.",

    "abstract": "The ability to evaluate drug solubility in milk and milk-related products has relevance both to human and veterinary medicine. Model compounds explored in a previous investigation focused on drug solubility assessments when delivered in milk-associated vehicles for administration to human patients. In the current investigation, we focus on the solubility of drugs intended for delivery via intramammary infusion to cattle. Because there are logistic challenges typically associated with obtaining raw milk samples for these tests, there is a need to determine potential alternative media as a substitute for raw bovine milk. Given the complexity of the milk matrix, aqueous media do not reflect the range of factors that could impact these solubility assessments. This led to the current effort to explore the magnitude of differences that might occur when substituting raw bovine milk with off-the-shelf milk products such as whole milk, skim milk, or reconstituted whole milk powder. We considered conclusions based upon the solubility assessments derived from the use of the model compounds studied in our previous report and compared them to conclusions obtained when testing two drugs with differing physicochemical characteristics that are approved for administration via bovine intramammary infusion: cephapirin benzathine and cephapirin sodium. Based upon these results, we recommend that whole milk or reconstituted whole milk can substitute for bovine raw milk for the solubility assessment of compounds intended for administration via intramammary infusion.

    "abstract": "It has previously been shown that chronic systemic administration of the GABAB agonist, baclofen, reduces body weight in free feeding rats but has no effect on long-term food intake. The present study was conducted to extend these observations by investigating the effects of baclofen on body weight, food intake and water consumption in rats maintained on a restricted feeding schedule. The rats were allowed free access to food for 3 hours each day and injected intraperitoneally (i.p) once daily over a period of 11 days with baclofen (4 mg / kg; n=8) or saline (Control Group; n=8) immediately after each feeding session. Baclofen treatment produced small decreases in food intake on Days 2, 4 and 5 (P<0.05) compared with control animals but there were no differences between the 2 groups on Days 6 to 11. Baclofen did not affect prandial water intake. However, baclofen significantly decreased body weight gain of the animals (F(1,14) = 22.0, P < 0.01) starting 3 days after the initiation of treatment. During the subsequent 9 days both groups received no treatments. However, the \"Baclofen Group\" continued displaying significant reductions in body weight gain (F(1,14) = 8.47 p<0.01) but there were no significant differences in food and water consumption between the 2 groups of animals. The results of this study indicate that repeated administration of baclofen to food-restricted rats for 11 days reduces body weight and that the effects persist when the drug is withdrawn. While it is possible that the decrease in food intake during the early period of the experiment may have been partly responsible for the reduction in body weight in the baclofen-treated animals, the observation that these rats displayed reduction in body weight during the latter part of the study when there was no significant differences in food intake between the 2 groups, suggests that the drug decreases body weight independently of its effects on food consumption.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveImpaired clock genes expression has been observed in biopsy samples from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Disruption of circadian rhythms, which occurs in shift workers, has been linked to an increased risk of gastrointestinal diseases, including IBD. The intestinal clock balances gastrointestinal homeostasis by regulating the microbiome. Here we characterize intestinal immune functions in mice lacking the intestinal clock and IBD-relevant mouse model under different feeding conditions to describe the functional impact of the intestinal clock in the development of gastrointestinal inflammation.\n\nDesignTissues and fecal samples from intestinal clock-deficient mice (Bmal1IEC-/-) and mouse models for colitis (IL-10-/-, Bmal1IEC-/-xIL-10-/-, dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) administration) under ad libitum and restricted feeding (RF) conditions were used to determine the causal role of the intestinal clock for colitis.\n\nResultsIn IL-10-/- mice, inflammation correlated with disrupted colon clock genes expression. Genetic loss of intestinal clock functions promoted DSS and IBD inflammatory phenotypes and dramatically reduces survival, and colonization with disease-associated microbiota in germ- free Bmal1IEC-/- hosts increased their inflammatory responses, demonstrating the causal role of colonic clock disruption and the severity of IBD. RF in IL-10-/- mice restored the colon clock and related immune functions, improved the inflammatory responses and rescued the histopathological phenotype.

Enhancing intestinal clock function by RF modulates the pathogenesis of IBD and thus could become a novel strategy to ameliorate the symptoms in IBD patients.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a debilitating disorder characterized by mechanical allodynia and sensory loss. It has traditionally been considered a small-fiber neuropathy, defined by the loss of free nerve endings in the epidermis. Free nerve endings, however, are nociceptors which may not be the only sensor for mechanical pain. To investigate the role of mechanoreceptors, specifically Meissner corpuscles, in the development of diabetic mechanical allodynia, our study focused on the keratinocyte-secreted brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its transcriptional regulator sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). Wild-type DN mice demonstrated decreased SIRT1 deacetylase activity, leading to a decrease in BDNF expression and Meissner corpuscle densities in foot skin. Epidermal SIRT1 knockout (KO) mice developed exacerbated DN phenotypes including severe mechanical allodynia, markedly reduced Meissner corpuscles, and subcutaneous A{beta} axon degeneration. Among the major skin-derived neurotrophic factors, only BDNF was down-regulated in epidermal SIRT1 KO mice. With similar KO phenotypes, epidermal BDNF appeared to belong to the same pathway as SIRT1 in modulating diabetic mechanical allodynia. Furthermore, mice overexpressing epidermal SIRT1 showed BDNF up-regulation and improved DN phenotypes, supporting an important role of epidermal SIRT1 and BDNF in skin sensory apparatus regeneration and functional recovery in the setting of diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Exosomes contain various intracellular biomarkers reflecting the condition of cells, organs, and subjects. Under neurodegenerative conditions, they contrive in detrimental neuronal communications leading to the initiation and propagation of neurodegenerative symptoms. Since the exosomes in olfactory fluid are readily accessible to collect in ample amount noninvasively and highly enriched in neural biomarkers, they can be a primary biomarker if we can verify precise pathophysiological information from them. Here we show that exosomes from nasal lavage fluid (NLF) of the neurodegeneration model animal, 5XFAD mice, induce the pathological network activity in neuronal cultures. We separated intact NLF exosomes from the 5XFAD and wild-type mice via a high-efficacy microfluidic system and applied them to the primary cortical neurons and organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSC), whose neuronal activities were monitored by a high-density microelectrode array system. We found that NLF exosomes from 5XFAD mice increased the firing rate of neuronal spikes with augmentation of neuronal connectivity similar to the effect of pathological amyloid beta oligomer treatment. Furthermore, the current source densities, computed from the local field potentials, were elevated in OHSCs incubated with the exosomes, suggesting a pathological shift in synaptic and membrane currents. Those results demonstrate that NLF exosomes from neurodegeneration model can effectively modify neuronal networks and suggest that this property can serve as a functional biomarker for Alzheimers disease.",

In this work, we generated cardiomyocytes derived from isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells to model the heterozygous pathogenic MYH7 missense variant, E848G, which is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and adultonset systolic dysfunction. MYH7E848G/+ increased cardiomyocyte size and reduced the maximum twitch forces of engineered heart tissue, consistent with the systolic dysfunction in MYH7 E848G HCM patients. Interestingly, MYH7E848G/+ cardiomyocytes more frequently underwent apoptosis that was associated with increased p53 activity relative to controls. However, genetic ablation of TP53 did not rescue cardiomyocyte survival or restore engineered heart tissue twitch force, indicating MYH7E848G/+ cardiomyocyte apoptosis and contractile dysfunction are p53-independent. Overall, our findings suggest that cardiomyocyte apoptosis plays an important role in the MYH7E848G/+ HCM phenotype in vitro and that future efforts to target p53-independent cell death pathways may be beneficial for the treatment of HCM patients with systolic dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance inevitably emerges during the treatment of cancer by targeted therapy. Adaptive resistance is a major form of drug resistance, wherein the rewiring of protein signalling networks in response to drug perturbation allows the drug-targeted proteins activity to recover, despite the continuous presence of the drug, enabling the cells to survive/grow. Simultaneously, molecular heterogeneity enables the selection of drug-resistant cancer clones that can survive an initial drug insult, proliferate, and eventually cause disease relapse. Despite their importance, the link between heterogeneity and adaptive resistance, specifically how heterogeneity influences protein signalling dynamics to drive adaptive resistance, remains poorly understood. Here, we have explored the relationship between heterogeneity, protein signalling dynamics and adaptive resistance through the development of a novel modelling technique coined Meta Dynamic Network (MDN) modelling. We use MDN modelling to characterise how heterogeneity influences the drug-response signalling dynamics of the proteins that regulate early cell cycle progression and demonstrate that heterogeneity can robustly facilitate adaptive resistance associated dynamics for key cell cycle regulators. We determined the influence of heterogeneity at the level of both protein interactions and protein expression and show that protein interactions are a much stronger driver of adaptive resistance. Owing to the mechanistic nature of the underpinning ODE framework, we then identified a full spectrum of subnetworks that drive adaptive resistance dynamics in the key early cell cycle regulators. Finally, we show that single-cell dynamic data supports the validity of our MDN modelling technique and a comparison between our predicted resistance mechanisms and known CDK4/6 and Estrogen Receptor inhibitor resistance mechanisms suggests MDN can be deployed to robustly predict network-level resistance mechanisms for novel drugs and additional protein signalling networks.",

Together with stromal cells, Paneth cells form a major element of the niche microenvironment that provides various growth factors to orchestrate intestinal stem cell homeostasis, such as Wnt33. With 19 family members, different Wnt ligands can selectively activate {beta}-catenin dependent (canonical) or independent (non-canonical) signaling4,5. Here, we report that Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis 1 (Daam1) and its paralogue Daam2 asymmetrically regulate canonical and non-canonical Wnt (Wnt/PCP) signaling, and their function is required for Paneth cell progenitor differentiation. We found that Daam1/2 interacts with the Wnt antagonist Rnf43, and Daam1/2 double knockout stimulates canonical Wnt signaling by preventing Rnf43-dependent endo-lysosomal degradation of the ubiquitinated Wnt receptor, Frizzled (Fzd). Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that Paneth cell differentiation is impaired by Daam1/2 depletion, as a result of defective Wnt/PCP signaling. Taken together, we identified Daam1/2 as an unexpected hub molecule coordinating both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling, the regulation of which is fundamental for specifying an adequate number of Paneth cells while maintaining intestinal stem cell homeostasis.",

While taxonomic and phylogenetic information were generally poor predictors of bacterial pH preferences, we identified genes consistently associated with pH preference across environments. We then developed and validated a machine learning model to estimate bacterial pH preferences from genomic information alone, a model which could aid in the selection of microbial inoculants, improve species distribution models, or help design effective cultivation strategies.

    "abstract": "Multilevel societies (MLS), which are characterized by two or more levels of social organization, are among the most complex primate social systems. MLS have only been recorded in a limited number of primates, including humans. The aim of this study was to identify a possible MLS of proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus) in Sabah, Malaysia, and to characterize their dispersal patterns. Association data were obtained through direct observation (35 months) and kinship data through genetic analysis, based on feces collected from [~]200 individuals. The results strongly suggest that proboscis monkeys exhibit a form of MLS, with several core reproductive units and a bachelor group woven together into a higher-level band. Genetic analysis revealed that the females migrated randomly over short and long distances; however, the males tended to migrate relatively shorter distances than females. Combined with the results of direct observations, we conclude that proboscis monkeys form a MLS with at least two layers and a patrilineal basis. Since patrilineal MLS have been identified as an important step in the evolution of human societies, their convergent appearance in proboscis monkeys may provide a useful correlate to understand the drivers of human social evolution.\n\nSignificance StatementThe aim of this study was to determine the social organization of proboscis monkeys by direct observation and genetic analysis. The results revealed that their social system exhibited a form of multilevel society with a possible patrilineal basis. Since humans exhibit a similar constellation of social features, proboscis monkeys may offer insightful clues about human social evolution.",

    "abstract": "Major challenges in biofabrication revolve around capturing the complex, hierarchical composition of native tissues. However, individual 3D printing techniques have limited capacity to produce composite biomaterials with multi-scale resolution. Volumetric bioprinting recently emerged as a paradigm-shift in biofabrication. This ultra-fast, light-based technique sculpts cell-laden hydrogel bioresins into three-dimensional structures in a layerless fashion, providing unparalleled design freedom over conventional bioprinting. However, it yields prints with low mechanical stability, since soft, cell-friendly hydrogels are used. Herein, for the first time, the possibility to converge volumetric bioprinting with melt electrowriting, which excels at patterning microfibers, is shown for the fabrication of tubular hydrogel-based composites with enhanced mechanical behavior. Despite including non-transparent melt electrowritten scaffolds into the volumetric printing process, high-resolution bioprinted structures were successfully achieved. Tensile, burst and bending mechanical properties of printed tubes were tuned altering the electrowritten mesh design, resulting in complex, multi-material tubular constructs with customizable, anisotropic geometries that better mimic intricate biological tubular structures. As a proof-of-concept, engineered vessel-like structures were obtained by building tri-layered cell-laden vessels, and features (valves, branches, fenestrations) that could be resolved only by synergizing these printing methods. This multi-technology convergence offers a new toolbox for manufacturing hierarchical and mechanically tunable multi-material living structures.",

    "abstract": "In human walking, the left and right legs move alternately, half a stride out of phase with each other. Although various parameters, such as stride frequency, stride length, and duty factor, vary with walking speed, the antiphase relationship of the leg motion remains unchanged. This is the case even during running. However, during walking in left-right asymmetric situations, such as walking with unilateral leg loading, walking along a curved path, and walking on a split-belt treadmill, the relative phase between left and right leg motion shifts from the antiphase condition to compensate for the asymmetry. In addition, the phase relationship fluctuates significantly during walking of elderly people and patients with neurological disabilities, such as those caused by stroke or Parkinsons disease. These observations suggest that appropriate interleg coordination is important for adaptive walking and that interleg coordination is strictly controlled during walking of healthy young people. However, the control mechanism of interleg coordination remains unclear. In the present study, we derive a quantity that models the control of interleg coordination during walking of healthy young people by taking advantage of a state-of-the-art method that combines big data science with nonlinear dynamics. This is done by modeling this control as the interaction between two coupled oscillators through the phase reduction theory and Bayesian inference method. However, the results were not what we expected. Specifically, we found that the relative phase between the motion of the legs is not actively controlled until the deviation from the antiphase condition exceeds a certain threshold. In other words, the control of interleg coordination has a dead zone like that in the case of the steering wheel of an automobile. Such forgoing of control presumably enhances energy efficiency and maneuverability during walking. Furthermore, the forgoing of control in specific situations, where we expect strict control, also appears in quiet standing. This suggests that interleg coordination in walking and quiet standing have a common characteristic strategy. Our discovery of the dead zone in the control of interleg coordination not only provides useful insight for understanding gait control in humans, but also should lead to the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in gait adaptation and disorders through further investigation of the dead zone.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic clocks, DNA methylation based predictive models of chronological age, are often utilized to study aging associated biology. Despite their widespread use, these methods do not account for other factors that also contribute to the variability of DNA methylation data. For example, many CpG sites show strong sex-specific or cell type specific patterns that likely impact the predictions of epigenetic age. To overcome these limitations, we developed a multidimensional extension of the Epigenetic Pacemaker, the Multi-State Epigenetic Pacemaker (MSEPM). We show that the MSEPM is capable of accurately modeling multiple methylation associated factors simultaneously, while also providing site specific models that describe the per site relationship between methylation and these factors. We utilized the MSEPM with a large aggregate cohort of blood methylation data to construct models of the effects of age, sex and cell type heterogeneity on DNA methylation. We found that these models capture a large faction of the variability at thousands of DNA methylation sites. Moreover, we found modeled sites that are primarily affected by aging and no other factors. Among these, those that lose methylation over time are enriched for CTCF transcription factor chip peaks, while those that gain methylation over time are enriched for REST transcription factor chip peaks. Both transcription factors are associated with transcriptional maintenance and suggest a general dysregulation of transcription with age that is not impacted by sex or cell type heterogeneity. In conclusion, the MSEPM is capable of accurately modeling multiple methylation associated factors and the models produced can illuminate site specific combinations of factors that affect methylation dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) microscopy is used in numerous biophysical and biomedical applications to monitor inter- and intramolecular interactions and conformational changes in the 2-10 nm range. FRET is currently being extended to in vivo optical imaging, its main application being in quantifying drug-target engagement or drug release in animal models of cancer using organic dye or nanoparticle-labeled probes. Herein, we compared FRET quantification using intensity-based FRET (sensitized emission FRET analysis with the 3-cube approach using an IVIS imager) and macroscopic fluorescence lifetime (MFLI) FRET using a custom system using a time-gated ICCD, for small animal optical in vivo imaging. The analytical expressions and experimental protocols required to quantify the product fD E of the FRET efficiency E and the fraction of donor molecules involved in FRET, fD, are described in detail for both methodologies. Dynamic in vivo FRET quantification of transferrin receptor-transferrin binding was acquired in live intact nude mice upon intravenous injection of near infrared-labeled transferrin FRET pair and benchmarked against in vitro FRET using hybridized oligonucleotides. Even though both in vivo imaging techniques provided similar dynamic trends for receptor-ligand engagement, we demonstrate that MFLI FRET has significant advantages. Whereas the sensitized emission FRET approach using the IVIS imager required 9 measurements (6 of which are used for calibration) acquired from three mice, MFLI FRET needed only one measurement collected from a single mouse, although a control mouse might be needed in a more general situation. Based on our study, MFLI therefore represents the method of choice for longitudinal preclinical FRET studies such as that of targeted drug delivery in intact, live mice.\n\nWHY IT MATTERSFRET measurements in live animals open a unique window into drug-target interaction monitoring, by sensing the close proximity between a donor and acceptor-labeled molecular probes. To perform these measurements, a 3-cube fluorescent intensity measurement strategy can be adopted, as is common for in vitro FRET microscopy studies. However, it is challenging to translate this already cumbersome approach to in vivo small animal imaging. Here, we compare this standard approach, for which we provide a revised analytical framework, to a conceptually much simpler and more powerful one based on fluorescence lifetime measurements. Our results demonstrate that the technical challenge of in vivo fluorescence lifetime macroscopic imaging is well worth surmounting to obtain quantitative, whole-animal information regarding molecular drug-target engagement.",

    "abstract": "Cell morphology is a fundamental feature used to evaluate patient specimens in pathological analysis. However, traditional cytopathology analysis of patient effusion samples is limited by low tumor cell abundance coupled with high background of non-malignant cells, restricting the ability for downstream molecular and functional analyses to identify actionable therapeutic targets. We applied the Deepcell platform that combines microfluidic sorting, brightfield imaging, and real-time deep learning interpretations based on multi-dimensional morphology to enrich carcinoma cells from malignant effusions without cell staining or labels. Carcinoma cell enrichment was validated with whole genome sequencing and targeted mutation analysis, which showed higher sensitivity for detection of tumor fractions and critical somatic variant mutations that were initially at low-levels or undetectable in pre-sort patient samples. Combined, our study demonstrates the feasibility and added value of supplementing traditional morphology-based cytology with deep learning, multi-dimensional morphology analysis, and microfluidic sorting.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsThe liver ensures organismal homeostasis through modulation of physiological functions over the course of the day. How liver diseases such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) affects daily transcriptome rhythms in the liver remains elusive. To start closing this gap, we evaluated the impact of NASH on the diurnal regulation of the liver transcriptome in mice. Along this, we investigated how stringent consideration of circadian rhythmicity affects the outcomes of NASH transcriptome analyses.\n\nApproach & ResultsComparative rhythm analysis of the liver transcriptome from diet-induced NASH and control mice revealed an almost 3h phase advance in global gene expression rhythms. Rhythmically expressed genes associated with DNA repair and cell cycle regulation showed increased overall expression and circadian amplitude. In contrast, lipid and glucose metabolism associated genes showed loss of circadian amplitude, reduced overall expression, and phase advances in NASH livers. Comparison of NASH-induced liver transcriptome responses between published studies revealed little overlap (12%) in differentially expressed genes (DEGs). However, by controlling for sampling time and using circadian analytical tools, a 7-fold increase in DEG detection was achieved compared to methods without time control.\n\nConclusionsNASH had a strong effect on circadian liver transcriptome rhythms with phase- and amplitude-specific effects for key metabolic and cell repair pathways, respectively. Accounting for circadian rhythms in NASH transcriptome studies markedly improves DEGs detection and enhances reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory cytokines released by the synovium after trauma disturb the gene regulatory network and have been implicated in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis. A mechanistic understanding of how aging perturbs this process can help identify novel interventions. Here, we introduced network paradigms to simulate cytokine-mediated pathological communication between the synovium and cartilage. Cartilage-specific network analysis of injured young and aged murine knees revealed aberrant matrix remodeling as a transcriptomic response unique to aged knees displaying accelerated cartilage degradation. Next, network-based cytokine inference with pharmacological manipulation uncovered IL6 family member, Oncostatin M, as a driver for the aberrant matrix remodeling. By implementing a phenotypic drug discovery approach, we identified that the activation of Oncostatin M recapitulated \"inflammation\" phenotype of knee osteoarthritis and highlighted high-value targets for drug development and repurposing. These findings offer translational opportunities targeting the inflammation-driven osteoarthritis phenotype.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/525463v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (67K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@21b702org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1761dd1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19f9fc2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b1a993_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes long-term disability and death in young adults. White matter is vulnerable to TBI damage. Demyelination is a major pathological change of white matter injury after TBI. Demyelination which is characterized by myelin sheath disruption and oligodendrocyte cell death leads to long-term neurological function deficits. Stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatments have shown neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects in the subacute and chronic phases of experimental TBI. Our previous study has revealed that combined SCF and G-CSF treatment (SCF+G-CSF) enhances myelin repair in the chronic phase of TBI. However, the long-term effect and mechanism of SCF+G-CSF-enhanced myelin repair remain unclear. In this study, we uncovered persistent and progressive myelin loss in the chronic phase of severe TBI. SCF+G-CSF treatment in the chronic phase of severe TBI enhanced remyelination in the ipsilateral external capsule and striatum. The SCF+G-CSF-enhanced myelin repair is positively correlated with the proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the subventricular zone. These findings reveal the therapeutic potential of SCF+G-CSF in myelin repair in the chronic phase of severe TBI and shed light on the mechanism underlying SCF+G-CSF-enhanced remyelination in chronic TBI.",

It has been suggested that trimeric S proteins preferably bind to plasma membrane areas with high concentrations of preferably multimeric ACE2 receptors to achieve a higher binding and infection efficiency1,3. However, our current knowledge about the influence of ACE2 expression and organization in the plasma membrane on SARS-CoV-2 infection efficiency remains elusive. Here we used direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) in combination with different labeling approaches to visualize the distribution and quantify the expression of ACE2 on different cells. Our results reveal that endogenous ACE2 receptors are present as monomers in the plasma membrane with densities of only 1-2 receptors m-2. In addition, binding of trimeric S proteins does not induce clustering of ACE2 receptors in the plasma membrane. Supported by infection studies using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles bearing S proteins our data demonstrate that a single S protein interaction per virus particle with a monomeric ACE2 receptor is sufficient for infection which attests SARS-CoV-2 a high infectivity.",

    "abstract": "Sirtuins (SIRT) exhibit deacetylation or ADP-ribosyltransferase activity and regulate a wide range of cellular processes in the nucleus, mitochondria and cytoplasm. The role of the only sirtuin that resides in the cytoplasm, SIRT2, in the development of heart failure (HF) and cardiac hypertrophy is not known. In this paper, we show that the hearts of mice with deletion of Sirt2 (Sirt2-/-) display improved cardiac function after ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) and pressure overload (PO), suggesting that SIRT2 exerts maladaptive effects in the heart in response to stress. Similar results were obtained in mice with cardiomyocyte-specific Sirt2 deletion. Mechanistic studies suggest that SIRT2 modulates cellular levels and activity of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2), which results in reduced expression of antioxidant proteins. Deletion of Nrf2 in the hearts of Sirt2-/- mice reversed protection after PO. Finally, treatment of mouse hearts with a specific SIRT2 inhibitors reduces cardiac size and attenuates cardiac hypertrophy in response to PO. These data indicate that SIRT2 has detrimental effects in the heart and plays a role in the progression of HF and cardiac hypertrophy, which makes this protein a unique member of the SIRT family. Additionally, our studies provide a novel approach for treatment of cardiac hypertrophy by targeting SIRT2 pharmacologically, providing a novel avenue for the treatment of this disorder.",

    "abstract": "The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic caused catastrophic socioeconomic consequences and fundamentally reshaped the lives of billions across the globe. Our current understanding of the relationships between clinical variables (demographics, symptoms, follow-up symptoms, comorbidities, treatments, lab results, complications, and other clinical measurements) and COVID-19 outcomes remains obscure. Various computational approaches have been employed to elucidate the relationships between different COVID-19 clinical variables and their contributions to the disease outcomes. However, it is often challenging to capture the indirect relationships, as well as the direction of those relationships, with the conventional pairwise correlation methods. Graphical models (e.g., Bayesian networks) can address these limitations but are computationally expensive, which substantially limits their applications in reconstructing relationship networks of umpteen clinical variables. In this study, we have developed a method named RAMEN, which employs Genetic Algorithm and random walks to infer the Bayesian relationship network between clinical variables. We applied RAMEN to a comprehensive COVID-19 dataset, Biobanque Quebecoise de la COVID-19 (BQC19). Most of the clinical variables in our reconstructed Bayesian network associated with COVID-19 severity, or long COVID, are supported by existing literature. We further computationally verified the effectiveness of the RAMEN method with statistical examinations of the multi-omics measurements (Clinical variables, RNA-seq, and Somascan) of the BQC19 data and simulations. The accurate inference of the relationships between clinical variables and disease outcomes powered by RAMEN will significantly advance the development of effective and early diagnostics of severe COVID-19 and long COVID, which can help save millions of lives.",

    "abstract": "ATRX is a chromatin remodelling ATPase that is involved in transcriptional regulation, DNA damage repair and heterochromatin maintenance. It has been widely studied for its role in ALT-positive cancers, but its role in neurological function remains elusive. Hypomorphic mutations in the X-linked ATRX gene cause a rare form of intellectual disability combined with alpha-thalassemia called ATR-X syndrome in hemizygous males. Patients also have facial dysmorphism, microcephaly, musculoskeletal defects and genital abnormalities. Since complete deletion of ATRX in mice results in early embryonic lethality, the field has largely relied on conditional knockout models to assess the role of ATRX in multiple tissues. Given that null alleles are not found in patients, a more patient-relevant model was needed. Here, we have produced and characterised the first patient mutation knock-in model of ATR-X syndrome, carrying the most common patient mutation, R246C. This is one of a cluster of missense mutations located in the chromatin interaction domain that disrupts its function. The knock-in mice recapitulate several aspects of the patient disorder, including craniofacial defects, microcephaly and impaired neurological function. They provide a powerful model for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ATR-X syndrome and for testing potential therapeutic strategies.",

In humans, SARS-CoV-2 immunity has been studied extensively in blood. However, the capacity of peripheral vaccination to generate sustained humoral and cellular immunity in the lung mucosa, and how this is influenced by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, is unknown. Bronchoalveolar lavage samples obtained from vaccinated donors with or without prior infection revealed enrichment of spike-specific antibodies, class-switched memory B cells and T cells in the lung mucosa compared to the periphery in the setting of hybrid immunity, whereas in the context of vaccination alone, local anti-viral immunity was limited to antibody responses. Spike-specific T cells persisted in the lung mucosa for up to 5 months post-vaccination and multi-specific T cell responses were detected at least up to 11 months post-infection. Thus, durable lung mucosal immunity against SARS-CoV-2 seen after hybrid exposure cannot be achieved by peripheral vaccination alone, supporting the need for vaccines targeting the airways.",

We hypothesized that endothelial TLR3 insufficiency contributes to lung vascular remodeling induced by SARS-CoV-2. In the lungs of COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters, we discovered thickening of the pulmonary artery media and microvascular rarefaction, which were associated with decreased TLR3 expression in lung tissue and pulmonary artery endothelial cells (ECs). In vitro, SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced endothelial TLR3 expression. Following infection with mouse-adapted (MA) SARS-CoV-2, TLR3 knockout mice displayed heightened pulmonary artery remodeling and endothelial apoptosis. Treatment with the TLR3 agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid reduced lung tissue damage, lung vascular remodeling, and endothelial apoptosis associated with MA SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, repression of endothelial TLR3 is a potential mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated lung vascular remodeling and enhancing TLR3 signaling is a potential strategy for treatment.",

Here, we explore a quiescence-inducing 3D-engineered matrix based on ultraviolet light-initiated thiol-ene-crosslinked alginate hydrogels, which generate mechanical confinement and induce growth arrest and survival against chemotherapy in cancer cells. As underlying mechanism, we identified stiffness-dependent nuclear localization of the four-and-a-half LIM domains 2 (FHL2) protein, leading to p53-independent high p21Cip1/Waf1 nuclear expression, validated in murine and human tissue. Suggestive of a resistance-causing role, cells in the quiescence-inducing matrix became sensitive against chemotherapy upon FHL2 downregulation.

The R programming language was utilized in this endeavor. A total of 50 slides were collected from various types of tissue, and were stained using an anti-cytokeratin antibody and the DAB detection method. These slides were then scanned using a high-resolution scanner, and the resulting images were analyzed using R, a custom script was specifically developed to segment the tissue and DAB-positive areas, and calculate the percentage of DAB staining on the slide. The results were then compared to manual measurements of DAB staining performed by a trained technician. The R-based method was found to be highly accurate, with a mean absolute error of only 0.76 % compared to manual measurements, this study provides evidence that the use of R for DAB quantification is a fast and reliable alternative to manual methods, enabling the analysis of large numbers of slides in a short period of time. It offers a valuable tool for researchers and technicians in the field of histopathology, enabling them to quickly and accurately analyze DAB staining on immunohistochemical slides, which is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases.",

Only between Chls, effects are found to be small (about only 0.1 EET efficiency change when introducing TDC instead of FRET). Effects of structural sampling were found to be small, illustrated by a small average standard deviation for the Qy state coupling elements (FRET/TDC: 0.97/0.94 cm-1). Due to the higher flexibility of the Bx state, the corresponding deviations are larger (FRET/TDC between Chl-Chl pairs: 17.58/22.67 cm-1, between Crt-Chl pairs: 62.58/31.63 cm-1). In summary, it was found for the Q band that the coupling between Chls varies only slightly depending on FRET or TDC, resulting in a minute effect on EET acceptor preference. In contrast, the coupling in the B band spectral region is found to be more affected. Here, the S2 (1Bu) states of the spatially challenging Crts may act as acceptors in addition to the Chl B states. Depending on FRET or TDC, several Chls show different Chl-to-Crt couplings. Interestingly, the EET between Chls or Crts in the B band is found to often outcompete the corresponding decay processes. The individual efficiencies for B band EET to Crts vary however strongly with the chosen coupling scheme (e.g., up to 0.29/0.99 FRET/TDC efficiency for the Chl a604/neoxanthin pair). Thus, the choice of coupling scheme must involve a consideration of the state of interest.",

    "abstract": "Decisions in Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) about impacts of chemical compounds on different species are based on critical effect indicators such as the 50% lethal concentration (LC50). Regulatory documents recommend concentration-response (or concentration-effect) model fitting on standard toxicity test data to get LC50 values. However, toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) models proved their efficiency to better exploit toxicity test data, at Tier-2 but also at Tier-1, delivering time-independent indicators. In particular, LC50 values can be obtained from the reduced General Unified Threshold model of Survival (GUTS-RED) with both variants, Stochastic Death and Individual Tolerance, that include parameter hb, the background mortality. Estimating hb during the fitting process or not depends on studies and fitting habits, while it may strongly influence the other GUTS-RED parameters, and consequently the LC50 estimate. We hypothesized that estimating hb from all data in all replicates over time should provide more precise LC50 estimates. We then explored how estimating hb impacted: (i) GUTS-RED model parameters; (ii) goodness-of-fit criteria (fitting plot, posterior predictive check, parameter correlation); (iii) LC50 accuracy and precision. We finally show that estimating hb does not impact the LC50 precision while providing more accurate and precise GUTS parameter estimates. Hence, estimating hb would lead to a more protective ERA.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=197 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/525496v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3ee285org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@89931eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19c70forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5bb72c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Specifications table\n\nO_TBL View this table:\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@156b31eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@109991borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@122f597org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@29a3a7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b75315_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL C_TBL",

The specific rubric was shown to improve quality of iNaturalist observations.

N1-methyladenosine (m1A) is an RNA modification that can affect gene expression and RNA stability. The m1A landscape and potential functions of m1A modification in neurons remain poorly understood. We explored RNA (mRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA) m1A modification in normal and OGD/R-treated neurons and the effect of m1A on diverse RNAs. We investigated the m1A landscape in primary neurons, identified m1A-modified RNAs, and found that OGD/R increased the number of m1A RNAs. m1A modification might also affect the regulatory mechanisms of noncoding RNAs, e.g., lncRNA-RBP interactions and circRNA translation. We showed that m1A modification mediates the circRNA/lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA mechanism and that 3UTR methylation of mRNAs can hinder miRNA-mRNA binding. Three methylation patterns were identified, and genes with different patterns had intrinsic mechanisms with potential m1A-regulatory specificity. Systematic analysis of the m1A landscape in normal and OGD/R neurons lays a critical foundation for understanding RNA methylation and provides new perspectives and a theoretical basis for treating and developing drugs for OGD/R pathology-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNeurorehabilitation approaches are frequently predicated on motor learning principles. However, much is left to be understood of how different kinds of motor learning are affected by stroke causing hemiparesis. Here we asked if two kinds of motor learning often employed in rehabilitation, (1) reinforcement learning and (2) error-based adaptation, are altered at different times after stroke.\n\nMethodsIn a cross-sectional design, we compared learning in two groups of patients with stroke, matched for their baseline motor execution deficit on the paretic side. The early group was tested within 3 months following stroke (N = 35) and the late group was tested more than 6 months after stroke (N = 30). Two types of task were studied: one based on reinforcement learning and the other on error-based learning.\n\nResultsWe found that reinforcement learning was impaired in the early but not the late group, whereas error-based learning was unaffected compared to controls. These findings could not be attributed to differences in baseline execution, cognitive impairment, gender, age, or lesion volume and location.\n\nConclusionsThe presence of a specific impairment in reinforcement learning in the first 3 months after stroke has important implications for rehabilitation. It might be necessary to either increase the amount of reinforcement feedback given early or even delay onset of certain forms of rehabilitation training, e.g., like constraint-induced movement therapy, and instead emphasize others forms of motor learning in this early time period. A deeper understanding of stroke-related changes in motor learning capacity has the potential to facilitate the development of new, more precise treatment interventions.",

    "abstract": "In mouse primary visual cortex (V1), familiar stimuli evoke significantly altered responses when compared to novel stimuli. This stimulus-selective response plasticity (SRP) was described originally as an increase in the magnitude of visual evoked potentials (VEPs) elicited in layer (L) 4 by familiar phase-reversing grating stimuli. SRP is dependent on NMDA receptors (NMDAR) and has been hypothesized to reflect potentiation of thalamocortical synapses in L4. However, recent evidence indicates that the synaptic modifications that manifest as SRP do not occur on L4 principal cells. To shed light on where and how SRP is induced and expressed, the present study had three related aims: (1) to confirm that NMDAR are required specifically in glutamatergic principal neurons of V1, (2) to investigate the consequences of deleting NMDAR specifically in L6, and (3) to use translaminar electrophysiological recordings to characterize SRP expression in different layers of V1. We find that knockout of NMDAR in L6 principal neurons disrupts SRP. Current-source density analysis of the VEP depth profile shows augmentation of short latency current sinks in layers 3, 4 and 6 in response to phase reversals of familiar stimuli. Multiunit recordings demonstrate that increased peak firing occurs to in response to phase reversals of familiar stimuli across all layers, but that activity between phase reversals is suppressed. Together, these data reveal important aspects of the underlying phenomenology of SRP and generate new hypotheses for the expression of experience-dependent plasticity in V1.\n\nSignificance StatementRepeated exposure to stimuli that portend neither reward nor punishment leads to behavioral habituation, enabling organisms to dedicate attention to novel or otherwise significant features of the environment. The neural basis of this process, which is so often dysregulated in neurological and psychiatric disorders, remains poorly understood. Learning and memory of stimulus familiarity can be studied in mouse visual cortex by measuring electrophysiological responses to simple phase-reversing grating stimuli. The current study advances knowledge of this process by documenting changes in visual evoked potentials, neuronal spiking activity, and oscillations in the local field potentials across all layers of mouse visual cortex. In addition, we identify a key contribution of a specific population of neurons in layer 6 of visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "The heterogeneity of the older population suggests the existence of subsets of individuals which share certain brain molecular features and respond differently to risk factors for Alzheimers disease, but this population structure remains poorly defined. Here, we performed an unsupervised clustering of individuals with multi-region brain transcriptomes to assess whether a broader approach, simultaneously considering data from multiple regions involved in cognition would uncover such subsets. We implemented a canonical correlation-based analysis in a Discovery cohort of 459 participants from two longitudinal studies of cognitive aging that have RNA sequence profiles in three brain regions. 690 additional participants that have data in only one or two of these regions were used in the Replication effort. These clustering analyses identified two meta-clusters, MC-1 and MC-2. The two sets of participants differ primarily in their trajectories of cognitive decline, with MC-2 having a delay of 3 years to the median age of incident dementia. This is due, in part, to a greater impact of tau pathology on neuronal chromatin architecture and to broader brain changes including greater loss of white matter integrity in MC-1. Further evidence of biological differences includes a significantly larger impact of APOE{varepsilon}4 risk on cognitive decline in MC-1. These findings suggest that our proposed population structure captures an aspect of the more distributed molecular state of the aging brain that either enhances the effect of risk factors in MC-1 or of protective effects in MC-2. These observations may inform the design of therapeutic development efforts and of trials as both become increasingly more targeted molecularly.\n\nOne Sentence Summary: There are two types of aging brains, with one being more vulnerable to APOE{varepsilon}4 and subsequent neuronal dysfunction and cognitive loss.",

    "abstract": "Studying the neural components regulating movement in human locomotion is obstructed by the inability to perform invasive experimental recording. Neuromechanical simulations can provide insights by modeling the locomotor circuits. Past neuromechanical models proposed control of locomotion either driven by central pattern generators (CPGs) with simple sensory commands or by a purely reflex-based network regulated by state-machine mechanisms. However, the physiological interpretation of these state-machines remains unclear. Here, we present a physiologically plausible model to investigate spinal control and modulation of human locomotion. We propose a bio-inspired controller composed of two coupled central pattern generators (CPGs) that produce the rhythm and pattern and a reflex-based network simulating low-level reflex pathways and Renshaw cells. This reflex network is based on leaky-integration neurons, and the whole system does not rely on changing reflex gains according to the gait cycle state. The only component of the controller that maintains a state-machine mechanism is the balance controller of the trunk. The musculoskeletal model is composed of a skeletal structure and 9 muscles per leg generating movement in sagittal plane. After optimizing the open parameters, human locomotion replicating kinematics and muscle activation naturally emerged. Furthermore, when CPGs were not activated, no stable and physiologically plausible gaits could be achieved through optimization, suggesting the necessity of this component to generate rhythmic behavior without a state machine mechanism regulating reflex activation. The controller could reproduce a wide range of speeds from 0.3 to 1.9 m/s. The results also showed that the net influence of feedback on motoneurons during perturbed locomotion is predominantly inhibitory and that the CPG network provides the timing of motoneurons activation by exciting or inhibiting muscles in specific gait phases. The proposed bio-inspired controller could contribute to our understanding of locomotor circuits of the intact spinal cord and could be used to study neuromotor disorders.",

    "abstract": "During subarachnoid haemorrhage, a blood clot forms in the subarachnoid space releasing extracellular haemoglobin (Hb), which causes oxidative damage and cell death in surrounding tissues. High rates of disability and cognitive decline in SAH survivors is attributed to loss of neurons and functional connections during secondary brain injury. Haptoglobin sequesters Hb for clearance, but this scavenging system is overwhelmed after a haemorrhage. Whilst exogenous haptoglobin application can attenuate cytotoxicity of Hb and in vivo, and in vivo the functional effects of sub-lethal Hb concentrations on surviving neurons and whether cellular function can be protected with haptoglobin treatment remain unclear. Here we use cultured neurons to investigate neuronal health and function across a range of Hb concentrations to establish the thresholds for cellular damage and investigate synaptic function. Hb impairs ATP concentrations and cytoskeletal structure. At clinically relevant but sublethal Hb concentrations, synaptic AMPAR-driven currents are reduced, accompanied by a reduction in GluA1 subunit expression. Haptoglobin co-application can prevent these deficits by scavenging free Hb to reduce it to sub-threshold concentrations and does not need to be present at stoichiometric amounts to achieve efficacy. Haptoglobin itself does not impair measures of neuronal health and function at any concentration tested. Our data highlight a role for Hb in modifying synaptic function after SAH, which may link to impaired cognition or plasticity, and support the development of haptoglobin as a therapy for subarachnoid haemorrhage.",

A panel of chilli accessions for varying fruit colour intensity revealed the correlation of carotenoid content with PSY and DXS transcript levels. The PSY and DXS genes were sequenced from high and low carotenoid genotypes to deduce potential allelic variation. PSY-1 and -2 showed tissue specific expression, with PSY-1and 2 expressed in chromoplast and chloroplast containing tissues, respectively. Protein modelling, phylogenetic analysis and transcription factor analysis was conducted to understand how the allelic variation identified could affect carotenoid biosynthesis and regulation, and subsequently colour intensity phenotype. A candidate mutation located in the transit peptide of the PSY-1 protein sequence was identified in the low colour intensity genotype. Within the promoter region of the DXS gene present in the high colour intensity genotype sequence variation was determined in the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate binding motif (GAPF) of the promoter region. These data can be exploited to develop tools and resources for the breeding of high colour intensity chilli pepper fruit.\n\nKey policy highlightsUsing the molecular findings disclosed in this article the potential exists to develop molecular markers for the breeding varieties of chilli peppers with improved aesthetic consumer preference and nutritional attributes.",

In this report, increased expression of TKS5, a scaffold protein essential for the formation of podosomes, was detected in the lung tissue of IPF patients and bleomycin (BLM)-treated mice, correlating with increased collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1) expression. The profibrotic milieu, TGF{beta}, as well as a stiff Col1a1-rich acellular fibrotic ECM, were found to induce TKS5 expression and the formation of prominent podosome rosettes in LFs, culminating in increased ECM invasion. Podosomes were retained ex vivo in the absence of any stimulation, indicating that the formation of TKS5-enabled podosomes is an inherent property of IPF LFs. Remarkably, haploinsufficient Tks5+/- mice were relatively resistant to BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Disease protection was largely attributable to diminished podosome formation in LFs and decreased ECM invasion, thus indicating TKS5-enabled and podosome-mediated ECM invasion as a major pathogenic mechanism in pulmonary fibrosis. Expression profiling revealed an ECM-podosome cross talk, and pharmacologic connectivity map analysis suggested several inhibitors that could prevent podosome formation and thus pulmonary fibrosis. Among them, inhibition of src kinase was shown to potently attenuate podosome formation in LFs, ECM invasion, as well as pulmonary fibrosis in post BLM precision cut lung slices, suggesting that pharmacological targeting of TKS5-enabled podosome formation is a very promising therapeutic option in pulmonary fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of premature mortality in the US and the world. CVD comprises of several complex and mostly heritable conditions, which range from myocardial infarction to congenital heart disease. Here, we report our findings from an integrative analysis of gene expression, disease-causing gene variants, and associated phenotypes among CVD populations, with a focus on high-risk Heart Failure (HF) patients. We built a cohort using electronic health records (EHR) of consented patients with available samples, and then performed high-throughput whole-genome and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of key genes responsible for HF and other CVD pathologies. We also incorporated a translational aspect to our study by integrating genomics findings with patient medical records. This involved linking ICD-10 codes with our gene expression and variant data to identify associations with HF and other CVDs. Our in-depth gene expression analysis revealed differentially expressed genes associated with HF (41 genes) and other CVDs (23 genes). Furthermore, a variant analysis of whole-genome sequence data of CVD patients identified genes with altered gene expression (FLNA, CST3, LGALS3, and HBA1) with functional and nonfunctional mutations in these genes. Our study highlights the importance of an integrative approach that leverages gene expression, genetic mutations, and clinical data that will allow the prioritization of key driver genes for complex diseases to improve personalized healthcare.",

    "abstract": "N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine hydrolyzing phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) is a zinc metallohydrolase that hydrolyzes N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPEs) to form N-acyl-ethanolamides (NAEs) and phosphatidic acid. Several lines of evidence suggest that reduced NAPE-PLD activity could contribute to cardiometabolic diseases. For instance, NAPEPLD expression is reduced in human coronary arteries with unstable atherosclerotic lesions, defective efferocytosis is implicated in the enlargement of necrotic cores of these lesions, and NAPE-PLD products such as palmitoylethanolamide and oleoylethanolamide have been shown to enhance efferocytosis. Thus, enzyme activation mediated by a small molecule may serve as a therapeutic treatment for cardiometabolic diseases. As a proof-of-concept study, we sought to identify small molecule activators of NAPE-PLD. High-throughput screening followed by hit validation and primary lead optimization studies identified a series of benzothiazole phenylsulfonyl-piperidine carboxamides that variably increased activity of both mouse and human NAPE-PLD. From this set of small molecules, two NAPE-PLD activators (VU534 and VU533) were shown to increase efferocytosis by bone-marrow derived macrophages isolated from wild-type mice, while efferocytosis was significantly reduced in Napepld-/- BMDM or after Nape-pld inhibition. Together these studies demonstrate an essential role for NAPE-PLD in the regulation of efferocytosis and the potential value of NAPE-PLD activators as a strategy to treat cardiometabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Collagen, the most abundant organic compound of vertebrate organisms, is a supramolecular, protein-made polymer. Details of its post-translational maturation largely determine the mechanical properties of connective tissues. Its assembly requires massive, heterogeneous prolyl-4-hydroxylation (P4H), catalyzed by Prolyl-4-hydroxylases (P4HA1-3), providing thermostability to its elemental, triple helical building block. So far, there was no evidence of tissue-specific regulation of P4H, nor of a differential substrate repertoire of P4HAs. Here, the post-translational modifications of collagen extracted from bone, skin, and tendon were compared, revealing lower hydroxylation of most GEP/GDP triplets, together with fewer other residue positions along collagen  chains, in the tendon. This regulation is mostly conserved in two distant homeotherm species, mouse and chicken. The comparison of detailed P4H patterns in both species suggests a dual mechanism of specificity. P4ha2 expression is low in tendon and its genetic invalidation in the ATDC5 cellular model of collagen assembly specifically mimics the tendon-related P4H profile. Therefore, P4HA2 has a better ability than other P4HAs to hydroxylate the corresponding residue positions. Its local expression participates in determining the P4H profile, a novel aspect of the tissue specificities of collagen assembly.\n\nData availabilityProteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD039221.

    "abstract": "With the development of deep learning, almost all single-domain proteins can be predicted at experimental resolution. However, the structure prediction of multi-domain proteins remains a challenge. Achieving end-to-end protein domain assembly and further improving the accuracy of the full-chain modelling by accurately predicting inter-domain orientation while improving the assembly efficiency will provide significant insights into structure-based drug discovery. In addition, the available GPU memory limits the size of a full-chain protein which can be predicted. Based on the divide-and-conquer strategy, the single-domain structure is predicted by the state-of-the-art prediction method, such as AlphaFold2, and then assembled into a full-chain model through the domain assembly method, which can effectively reduce the demand for hardware resources. In this work, we propose an End-To-End Domain Assembly method based on deep learning, named E2EDA. We first develop an EffificientNetV2-based deep learning model (RMNet), which is specialised for predicting inter-domain orientations. The RMNet uses an attention mechanism to predict inter-domain rigid motion by fusing sequence features, multiple template features and single-domain features. Then, the predicted rigid motions are converted into inter-domain spatial transformations to assemble full-chain models of multi-domain proteins directly without time-consuming simulation processes. Finally, a scoring strategy, RMscore, is designed to select the best model from multiple assembled models to improve assembly accuracy. The experimental results show that the average TM-score of the model assembled by E2EDA on the benchmark set (356) is 0.84, which is better than other domain assembly methods SADA (0.80), DEMO (0.74) and AIDA (0.63). Meanwhile, on our constructed human protein dataset from AlphaFold DB, the model reassembled by E2EDA is 6.8% higher than the full-chain model predicted by AlphaFold2, indicating that E2EDA can capture more accurate inter-domain orientations to improve the quality of the model predicted by AlphaFold2. Furthermore, the average running time of E2EDA on the benchmark is reduced by 74.6% compared with the domain assembly simulation method SADA, which indicates that E2EDA can effectively improve assembly efficiency through an end-to-end manner.The online server is at http://zhanglab-bioinf.com/E2EDA/.",

Coating of PDMS walls with SiO2 virtually eliminates non-specific sample adsorption and ensures maintenance of the stoichiometry of the reaction, rendering it highly reproducible. In an operating range from 10 to 1000 ms, the device allows us to follow in vitro reactions of biological molecules at resolution levels in the range of 3 [A].

    "abstract": "NMR chemical shifts provide a sensitive probe of protein structure and dynamics. Prediction of shifts, and therefore interpretation of shifts, particularly for the frequently measured amidic 15N sites, remains a tall challenge. We demonstrate that protein 15N chemical shift prediction from QM/MM predictions can be improved if conformational variation is included via MD sampling, focusing on the antibiotic target, E. coli Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Variations of up to 25 ppm in predicted 15N chemical shifts are observed over the trajectory. For solution shifts the average of fluctuations on the low picosecond timescale results in a superior prediction to a single optimal conformation. For low temperature solid state measurements, the histogram of predicted shifts for locally minimized snapshots with specific solvent arrangements sampled from the trajectory explains the heterogeneous linewidths; in other words, the conformations and associated solvent are  frozen out at low temperatures and result in inhomogeneously broadened NMR peaks. We identified conformational degrees of freedom that contribute to chemical shift variation. Backbone torsion angles show high amplitude fluctuations during the trajectory on the low picosecond timescale. For a number of residues, including I60, {psi} varies by up to 60{o} within a conformational basin during the MD simulations, despite the fact that I60 (and other sites studied) are in a secondary structure element and remain well folded during the trajectory. Fluctuations in {psi} appear to be compensated by other degrees of freedom in the protein, including {varphi} of the succeeding residue, resulting in \"rocking\" of the amide plane with changes in hydrogen bonding interactions. Good agreement for both room temperature and low temperature NMR spectra provides strong support for the specific approach to conformational averaging of computed chemical shifts.",

    "abstract": "HOP2 is a conserved protein that plays a positive role in homologous chromosome pairing and a separable role in preventing illegitimate connections between nonhomologous chromosome regions during meiosis. We employed ChIP-seq to discover that Arabidopsis HOP2 binds along the length of all chromosomes, except for centromeric and nucleolar organizer regions, and no binding sites were detected in the organelle genomes. A large number of reads were assigned to the HOP2 locus itself, yet TAIL-PCR and SNP analysis of the aligned sequences indicate that many of these reads originate from the transforming T-DNA, supporting the role of HOP2 in preventing nonhomologous exchanges. The 292 ChIP-seq peaks are largely found in promoter regions and downstream from genes, paralleling the distribution of recombination hotspots, and motif analysis revealed that there are several conserved sequences that are also enriched at crossover sites. We conducted coimmunoprecipitation of HOP2 followed by LC-MS/MS and found enrichment for several proteins, including some histone variants and modifications that are also known to be associated with recombination hotspots. We propose that HOP2 may be directed to chromatin motifs near double strand breaks, where homology checks are proposed to occur.",

Nevertheless, the impact of TF dynamics on reprogramming efficiency remains uncharted.

By combining a genetic circuit that generates a wide range of OCT4 trajectories with live-cell imaging, we track OCT4 trajectories with clonal resolution and find that a distinct constant OCT4 trajectory is required for colony formation. We then develop a synthetic genetic circuit that yields a tight OCT4 distribution around the identified trajectory and outperforms in terms of reprogramming efficiency other circuits that less accurately regulate OCT4. Our synthetic biology approach is generalizable for identifying and enforcing TF dynamics for cell fate programming applications.\n\nOne-sentence summaryGenetic controllers and live-cell imaging offer a versatile strategy for probing the role of transcription factor dynamics in cell fate transitions.",

Previous studies focusing on its genetic structure suggested the existence of cryptic genetic variation in this species. Yet, these studies used different genetic markers, focused on different geographical areas, and did not include Europe. Our first goal was to determine the worldwide genetic structure of this species based on both mitochondrial and genomic markers. Our second goal was to study X. crassiusculus invasion history on a global level and identify the origins of the invasion in Europe. We used a COI and RAD sequencing design to characterize 188 and 206 specimens worldwide, building the most comprehensive genetic dataset for any ambrosia beetle to date. The results were largely consistent between markers. Two differentiated genetic clusters were invasive, albeit in different regions of the world. The two markers were inconsistent only for a few specimens found exclusively in Japan. Mainland USA could have acted as a source for further expansion to Canada and Argentina through stepping-stone expansion and bridgehead events. We showed that Europe was only colonized by Cluster 2 through a complex invasion history including several arrivals from multiple origins in the native area, and possibly including bridgehead from the USA. Our results also suggested that Spain was colonized directly from Italy through intracontinental dispersion. It is unclear whether the mutually exclusive allopatric distribution of the two Clusters is due to neutral effects or due to different ecological requirements.",

Most imagery studies to date have focused on cue-induced imagery, namely the to-be-imagined contents were triggered by external cues. It has remained unclear how internal experience derives volitionally in the absence of any external cues, and whether this kind of self-generated imagery relies on an analogous cortical network as cue-induced imagery. Here, leveraging a novel self-generated imagery paradigm, we systematically examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of self-generated imagery, by having participants volitionally imagining one of the orientations from a learned pool; and of cue-induced imagery, by having participants imagining line orientations based on associative cues acquired previously. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in combination with multivariate encoding and decoding approaches, our results revealed largely overlapping neural signatures of cue-induced and self-generated imagery in both EEG and fMRI; yet, these neural signatures displayed substantially differential sensitivities to the two types of imagery: self-generated imagery was supported by an enhanced involvement of anterior cortex in generating and maintaining imagined contents, as evidenced by enhanced neural representations of orientations in sustained potentials in central channels in EEG, and in posterior frontal cortex in fMRI. By contrast, cue-induced imagery was supported by enhanced neural representations of orientations in alpha-band activity in posterior channels in EEG, and in early visual cortex in fMRI. These results jointly support a reverse cortical hierarchy in generating and maintaining imagery contents in self-generated versus externally-cued imagery.",

    "abstract": "Aluminium (Al3+) has long been related to neurotoxicity and neurological diseases. This study aims to describe the specific actions of this metal on cellular excitability and neurotransmitter release. Al3+ reduced intracellular calcium concentrations around 25% and decreased catecholamine secretion in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 89.1 M. Al3+ blocked calcium currents in a time- and concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 560 M. This blockade was irreversible, since it did not recover after wash-out. Moreover, Al3+ produced a bigger blockade on N-, P- and Q-type calcium channels subtypes (69.5%) than on L-type channels subtypes (50.5%). Sodium currents were also inhibited by Al3+ in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, 24.3% blockade at the closest concentration to the IC50 (419 M). This inhibition was reversible. Voltage-dependent potassium currents were non-significantly affected by Al3+. Nonetheless, calcium/voltage-dependent potassium currents were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 447 M. This inhibition was related to the depression of calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels subtypes coupled to BK channels. In summary, the blockade of these ionic conductances altered cellular excitability that reduced the action potentials firing and so, the neurotransmitter release and the synaptic transmission. These findings prove that aluminium has neurotoxic properties because it alters neuronal excitability by inhibiting the sodium currents responsible for the generation and propagation of impulse nerve, the potassium current responsible for the termination of action potentials, and the calcium current responsible for the neurotransmitters release.",

However, the precise conditions for rescuing normal excitability in KO-Lgi1 neurons have still not been reported. Here we show that the selective expression of LGI1 in KO-Lgi1 neurons with the use of single-cell electroporation reduces intrinsic excitability, and restores both the Kv1.1 mediated D-type current and Kv1.1 immunostaining at the AIS. In addition, we show that the homeostatic shortening of the AIS length observed in KO-Lgi1 neurons is prevented in neurons electroporated with the Lgi1 gene. Furthermore, we reveal a spatial gradient of both intrinsic excitability and Kv1.1 immunostaining that is centred on the electroporated neuron. We conclude that expression of LGI1 restores normal excitability through the expression of functional Kv1 channels at the AIS.",

    "abstract": "In most cultures infant directed speech (IDS) is used to communicate with young children. The main role IDS plays in parent-child interactions appears to change over time from conveying emotion to facilitating language acquisition. There is EEG evidence for the discrimination of IDS form adult directed speech (ADS) at birth, however, less is known about the development of brain networks responsible for differentially processing IDS and ADS. The current study compared topological characteristics of functional brain networks obtained from 49 healthy infants at the age of 0, 6, and 9 months listening to the same fairy tale presented by the same speaker in IDS and ADS speech. Brain connectivity was assessed by the phase lag synchronization index in 6 frequency bands (delta, theta, low alpha, high alpha, beta, gamma). The topology of the large scale network organization was quantified using minimum spanning tree graphs, separately for each band. The delta band cortical networks organization was found to be significantly more hierarchical and had a more cost-efficient organization during listening to ID compared to listening to AD.

    "abstract": "The injectable progestin depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is a popular contraceptive choice in sub-Saharan Africa although mouse models indicate it weakens genital epithelial integrity and barrier function and increases susceptibility to genital infection. The intravaginal ring NuvaRing(R) is another contraceptive option that like DMPA suppresses hypothalamic pituitary ovarian (HPO) axis function with local release of progestin (etonogestrel) and estrogen (ethinyl estradiol). As we previously reported that treating mice with DMPA and estrogen averts the loss of genital epithelial integrity and barrier function induced by DMPA alone, in the current investigation we compared genital levels of the cell-cell adhesion molecule desmoglein-1 (DSG1) and genital epithelial permeability in rhesus macaques (RM) treated with DMPA or a NuvaRing(R)re-sized for RM (N-IVR). While these studies demonstrated comparable inhibition of the HPO axis with DMPA or N-IVR, DMPA induced significantly lower genital DSG1 levels and greater tissue permeability to intravaginally administered low molecular mass molecules. By identifying greater compromise of genital epithelial integrity and barrier function in RM administered DMPA vs. N-IVR, our results add to the growing body of evidence that indicate DMPA weakens a fundamental mechanism of anti-pathogen host defense in the female genital tract.",

    "abstract": "Although red blood cell (RBC) transfusions save lives, some patients develop clinically-significant alloantibodies against donor blood group antigens, which then have adverse effects in multiple clinical settings. Few effective measures exist to prevent RBC alloimmunization and/or eliminate alloantibodies in sensitized patients. Donor-related factors may influence alloimmunization; thus, there is an unmet clinical need to identify which RBC units are immunogenic. Repeat volunteer blood donors and donors on iron supplements have elevated reticulocyte counts compared to healthy non-donors. Early reticulocytes retain mitochondria and other components, which may act as danger signals in immune responses. Herein, we tested whether reticulocytes in donor RBC units could enhance RBC alloimmunization. Using a murine model, we demonstrate that transfusing donor RBC units with increased reticulocyte frequencies dose-dependently increase RBC alloimmunization rates and alloantibody levels. Transfusing reticulocyte-rich RBC units was associated with increased RBC clearance from the circulation and a robust proinflammatory cytokine response. As compared to previously reported post-transfusion RBC consumption patterns, erythrophagocytosis from reticulocyte-rich units was increasingly performed by splenic B cells. These data suggest that reticulocytes in a donated RBC unit impact the quality of blood transfused, are targeted to a distinct compartment, and may be an underappreciated risk factor for RBC alloimmunization.",

Recently, we characterized T7SSb in group B Streptococcus (GBS), a leading cause of infection in newborns and immunocompromised adults. GBS T7SS comprises four subtypes based on variation in the C-terminus of EssC and the repertoire of downstream effectors; however, the intra-species diversity of GBS T7SS and impact on GBS-host interactions remains unknown. Bioinformatic analysis indicates that GBS T7SS loci encode subtype-specific putative effectors, which have low inter-species and inter-subtype homology but contain similar domains/motifs and therefore may serve similar functions. We further identify orphaned GBS WXG100 proteins. Functionally, we show that GBS T7SS subtype I and III strains secrete EsxA in vitro and that in subtype I strain CJB111, esxA1 appears to be differentially transcribed from the T7SS operon. Further, we observe subtype-specific effects of GBS T7SS on host colonization, as subtype I but not subtype III T7SS promotes GBS vaginal persistence. Finally, we observe that T7SS subtypes I and II are the predominant subtypes in clinical GBS isolates. This study highlights the potential impact of T7SS heterogeneity on host-GBS interactions.",

    "abstract": "A universal feature of ecological systems is that species do not interact with others with the same sign and strength. Yet, the consequences of this asymmetry in biotic interactions for the short- and long-term persistence of individual species and entire communities remains unclear. Here, we develop a set of metrics to evaluate how asymmetric interactions among species translate to asymmetries in their individual vulnerability to extinction under changing environmental conditions. These metrics, which solve previous limitations of how to independently quantify the size from the shape of the so-called feasibility domain, provide rigorous advances to understand simultaneously why some species and communities present more opportunities to persist than others. We further demonstrate that our shape-related metrics are useful to predict short-term changes in species relative abundances during seven years in a Mediterranean grassland. Our approach is designed to be applied to any ecological system regardless of the number of species and type of interactions. With it, we show that is possible to obtain both mechanistic and predictive information on ecological persistence for individual species and entire communities, paving the way for a stronger integration of theoretical and empirical research.",

    "abstract": "Natural ecological communities exhibit complex mixtures of interspecific biological interactions, which makes finding optimal yet sustainable exploitation rates challenging. Most fisheries management advice is at present based on applying the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) target to each species in a community by modelling it as if it was a monoculture. Such application of single-species MSY policies to strongly interacting populations can result in tragic overexploitation. However, the idea of \"maximising the yield from each species separately\" can be extended to take into account species interactions using a multispecies or ecosystem model and determining a Nash Equilibrium (NE), where the yields of each species taken in isolation are simultaneously maximised. Here we present  nash, an R package that streamlines the computation of NE reference points for fisheries and other systems represented by a user-defined multispecies or ecosystem model. We present two real-world fisheries management applications alongside performance benchmarks. Satisfactorily search results are shown across models with an approximate factor 15 increase in performance when compared to the expensive round-robbing sequential optimisation algorithms used by other authors in the literature. We believe that the nash package can play an instrumental role in fully implementing ecosystem-based management policies worldwide.\n\nOpen Research statementThis submission uses novel code, which is provided, per our requirements, in an external repository to be evaluated during the peer review process via the following link https://github.com/ThomasDelSantoONeill/nash",

Long read nanopore sequencers enable simultaneous reading of both DNA sequence and methylation and can multiplex samples for low-cost genome skimming. Here I present nanopore sequencing as a highly precise platform for global DNA methylation and transposon assessment. At coverage of just 0.001X, or 30 Mb of reads, accuracy is sub-1%. Biological and technical replicates validate high precision. Skimming 40 vertebrate species reveals conserved patterns of global methylation consistent with whole genome bisulfite sequencing and an average mapping rate above 97%. Genome size directly correlates to global DNA methylation, explaining 44% of its variance. Accurate SINE and LINE transposon methylation in both mouse and primates can be obtained with just 0.0001X coverage, or 3 Mb of reads. Sample multiplexing, field portability, and the low price of this instrument combine to make genome skimming for DNA methylation an accessible method for epigenetic assessment from ecology to epidemiology, and by low resource groups.",

    "abstract": "3-Phosphoinositides are ubiquitous cellular lipids that play pivotal regulatory roles in health and disease. Generation of 3-phosphoinositides are driven by three families of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) but the mechanisms underlying their regulation and cross-talk are not fully understood. Among 3-phosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) remains the least understood species in terms of its spatiotemporal dynamics and physiological function due to the lack of specific probes. By means of spatiotemporally resolved in situ quantitative imaging of PI(3,5)P2 using a newly developed ratiometric PI(3,5)P2 sensor we demonstrate that a special pool of PI(3,5)P2 is generated on lysosomes and late endosomes in response to growth factor stimulation. This PI(3,5)P2 pool, the formation of which is mediated by Class II PI3KC2{beta} and PIKFyve, plays a crucial role in terminating the activity of growth factor-stimulated Class I PI3K, one of the most frequently mutated proteins in cancer, via specific interaction with its regulatory p85 subunit. Cancer-causing mutations of Class I PI3K inhibit the p85-PI(3,5)P2 interaction and thereby induce sustained activation of Class I PI3K. Our results unravel a hitherto unknown tight regulatory interplay between Class I and II PI3Ks mediated by PI(3,5)P2, which may be important for controlling the strength of PI3K-mediated growth factor signaling. These results also suggest a new therapeutic possibility of treating cancer patients with p85 mutations.",

In this study, Streptomyces bacterium was used for biological production of silver nanoparticles, due to its resistance to the antimicrobial properties of silver. The synthesis and the size range of nanoparticles were confirmed using validation methods. For preparing biocomposite that entraps biological agents, microencapsulation of bacteria was adopted using gellan gum and alginate. In order to validate the final product, the viscosity and porosity of the biocomposite were determined. These tests aimed to investigate the mechanical properties affecting the behaviour and the response time of the final detector. In the end, the detector was exposed to hydrogen sulfide gas, and the color changes of the detector were recorded by time. According to the results, the control sample remained unchanged in all concentrations. However, the color of the test sample, changed faster with the increase in the input gas concentration. Moreover, no color change was observed in concentrations less than 20 mg/l. Therefore, the designed biodetector can be used for qualitative and semi-quantitative measurement of Hydrogen sulfide, in concentrations higher than 20 mg/l.",

    "abstract": "T-Cell Intracellular Antigen-1 (TIA1) is a 43 kDa multi-domain RNA-binding protein involved in stress granule formation during eukaryotic stress response, and has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases including Welander distal myopathy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. TIA1 contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are capable of binding nucleic acids and a C-terminal Q/N-rich prion-related domain (PRD) which has been variously described as intrinsically disordered or prion inducing and is believed to play a role in promoting liquid-liquid phase separation connected with the assembly of stress granule formation. Motivated by the fact that our prior work shows RRMs 2 and 3 are well-ordered in an oligomeric full-length form, while RRM1 and the PRD appear to phase separate, the present work addresses whether the oligomeric form is functional and competent for binding, and probes the consequences of nucleic acid binding for oligomerization and protein conformation change. New SSNMR data show that ssDNA binds to full-length oligomeric TIA1 primarily at the RRM2 domain, but also weakly at the RRM3 domain, and Zn2+ binds primarily to RRM3. Binding of Zn2+ and DNA was reversible for the full-length wild type oligomeric form, and did not lead to formation of amyloid fibrils, despite the presence of the C-terminal prion-related domain. While TIA1:DNA complexes appear as long \"daisy chained\" structures, the addition of Zn2+ caused the structures to collapse. We surmise that this points to a regulatory role for Zn2+. By occupying various \"half\" binding sites on RRM3 Zn2+ may shift the nucleic acid binding off RRM3 and onto RRM2. More importantly, the use of different half sites on different monomers may introduce a mesh of crosslinks in the supramolecular complex rendering it compact and markedly reducing the access to the nucleic acids (including transcripts) from solution.",

    "abstract": "Advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provide an unprecedented window into cellular identity. The increasing abundance of data requires new theoretical and computational frameworks for understanding cell fate determination, accurately classifying cell fates from expression data, and integrating knowledge from cell atlases. Here, we present single-cell Type Order Parameters (scTOP): a statistical-physics-inspired approach for constructing \"order parameters\" for cell fate given a reference basis of cell types. scTOP can quickly and accurately classify cells at a single-cell resolution, generate interpretable visualizations of developmental trajectories, and assess the fidelity of engineered cells. Importantly, scTOP does this without using feature selection, statistical fitting, or dimensional reduction (e.g., UMAP, PCA, etc.). We illustrate the power of scTOP utilizing a wide variety of human and mouse datasets (both in vivo and in vitro). By reanalyzing mouse lung alveolar development data, we characterize a transient perinatal hybrid alveolar type 1/alveolar type 2 (AT1/AT2) cell population that disappears by 15 days post-birth and show that it is transcriptionally distinct from previously identified adult AT2-to-AT1 transitional cell types. Visualizations of lineage tracing data on hematopoiesis using scTOP confirm that a single clone can give rise to as many as three distinct differentiated cell types. We also show how scTOP can quantitatively assess the transcriptional similarity between endogenous and transplanted cells in the context of murine pulmonary cell transplantation. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use Python implementation of scTOP. Our results suggest that physics-inspired order parameters can be an important tool for understanding development and characterizing engineered cells.",

    "abstract": "Improved biomarkers are needed for early cancer detection, risk stratification, treatment selection, and monitoring treatment response. While proteins can be useful blood-based biomarkers, many have limited sensitivity or specificity for these applications. Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1, L1) open reading frame 1 protein (ORF1p) is a transposable element protein overexpressed in carcinomas and high-risk precursors during carcinogenesis with negligible detectable expression in corresponding normal tissues, suggesting ORF1p could be a highly specific cancer biomarker. To explore the potential of ORF1p as a blood-based biomarker, we engineered ultrasensitive digital immunoassays that detect mid-attomolar (10-17 M) ORF1p concentrations in patient plasma samples across multiple cancers with high specificity. Plasma ORF1p shows promise for early detection of ovarian cancer, improves diagnostic performance in a multi-analyte panel, and provides early therapeutic response monitoring in gastric and esophageal cancers. Together, these observations nominate ORF1p as a multi-cancer biomarker with potential utility for disease detection and monitoring.\n\nStatement of SignificanceLINE-1 ORF1p transposon protein is pervasively expressed in many cancers and a highly specific biomarker of multiple common, lethal carcinomas and their high-risk precursors in tissue and blood.

    "abstract": "Vision is critical for the regulation of mating behaviors in many species. Here, we discovered that the Drosophila ortholog of human GABAA-receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) is required to fine-tune male courtship by modulating the activity of visual feedback neurons, lamina tangential cells (Lat). GABARAP is a ubiquitin-like protein that regulates cell-surface levels of GABAA receptors. Knocking down GABARAP or GABAA receptors in Lat neurons or hyperactivating them induces male courtship toward other males. Inhibiting Lat neurons, on the other hand, delays copulation by impairing the ability of males to follow females. Remarkably, the human ortholog of Drosophila GABARAP restores function in Lat neurons. Using in vivo two-photon imaging and optogenetics, we show that Lat neurons are functionally connected to neural circuits that mediate visually-guided courtship pursuits in males. Our work reveals a novel physiological role for GABARAP in fine-tuning the activity of a visual circuit that tracks a mating partner during courtship.",

    "abstract": "Myelin regeneration (remyelination) is essential to prevent neurodegeneration in demyelinating diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis but its efficiency declines with age. Regulatory T cells (Treg) recently emerged as critical players in tissue regeneration, including remyelination. However, the effect of ageing on Treg-mediated regenerative processes is poorly understood. Here, we show that expansion of aged Treg does not rescue age-associated remyelination impairment due to an intrinsically diminished capacity of aged Treg to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. This decline in regenerative Treg functions can be rescued by a young environment. We identified Melanoma Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (MCAM1) and Integrin alpha 2 (ITGA2) as novel candidates of Treg-mediated oligodendrocyte differentiation that decrease with age. Our findings demonstrate that ageing limits the neuroregenerative capacity of Treg, likely limiting their remyelinating therapeutic potential in aged patients and describe two novel mechanisms implicated in Treg-driven remyelination that may be targetable to overcome this limitation.",

We used ultraviolet radiation to induce SCC in SKH1 hairless mice. We then treated the mice with broad-band antibiotics to deplete the microbiome, followed by colonization by candidate skin and gut bacteria or persistent antibiotic treatment, all in parallel with ICI treatment. We longitudinally monitored skin and gut microbiome dynamics by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and tumor burden by periodic tumor measurements and histologic assessment.

    "abstract": "Whole-genome duplications (WGDs) have been at the heart of the diversification of {beta}-adrenergic receptors ({beta}-ARs) in vertebrates. Non-teleost jawed vertebrates typically possess three {beta}-AR genes: adrb1 ({beta}1-AR), adrb2 ({beta}2-AR), and adrb3 ({beta}3-AR), originating from the ancient 2R (two rounds) WGDs. Teleost fishes, owing to the teleost-specific WGD, have five ancestral adrb paralogs (adrb1, adrb2a, adrb2b, adrb3a and adrb3b). Salmonids are particularly intriguing from an evolutionary perspective as they experienced an additional WGD after separating from other teleosts. Moreover, adrenergic regulation in salmonids, especially rainbow trout, has been intensively studied for decades. However, the repertoire of adrb genes in salmonids has not been yet characterized. An exhaustive genome survey of diverse salmonids, spanning five genera, complemented by phylogenetic sequence analysis, revealed each species has seven adrb paralogs: two adrb2a, two adrb2b, two adrb3a and one adrb3b. Surprisingly, salmonids emerge as the first known jawed vertebrate lineage to lack adrb1. adrb1 is nevertheless highly expressed in the hearts of non-salmonid teleosts, indicating that the wealth of data on adrenergic regulation in salmonids should be generalised to other teleost fishes with caution. It is hypothesised that the loss of adrb1 could have been viable because of the evolutionary radiation of adrb2 and adrb3 genes attributable to the salmonid WGD.",

    "abstract": "Dynein is the primary minus-end-directed microtubule motor [1]. To achieve activation, dynein binds to the dynactin complex and an adaptor to form the \"activated dynein complex\" [2, 3]. The protein Lis1 aids activation by binding to dynein and promoting its association with dynactin and adaptor [4, 5]. Ndel1 and its orthologue Nde1 are dynein and Lis1 binding proteins that help control where dynein localizes within the cell [6]. Cell-based assays suggest that Ndel1/Nde1 also work with Lis1 to promote dynein activation, although the underlying mechanism is unclear [6]. Using purified proteins and quantitative binding assays, we found that Ndel1s C-terminal region contributes to binding to dynein and negatively regulates binding to Lis1. Using single-molecule imaging and protein biochemistry, we observed that Ndel1 inhibits dynein activation in two distinct ways. First, Ndel1 disfavors the formation of the activated dynein complex. We found that phosphomimetic mutations in Ndel1s C-terminal domain increase its ability to inhibit dynein-dynactin-adaptor complex formation. Second, we observed that Ndel1 interacts with dynein and Lis1 simultaneously and sequesters Lis1 away from its dynein binding site. In doing this, Ndel1 prevents Lis1-mediated dynein activation. Our work suggests that in vitro, Ndel1 is a negative regulator of dynein activation, which contrasts with cellular studies where Ndel1 promotes dynein activity. To reconcile our findings with previous work, we posit that Ndel1 functions to scaffold dynein and Lis1 together while keeping dynein in an inhibited state. We speculate that Ndel1 release can be triggered in cellular settings to allow for timed dynein activation.",

    "abstract": "Lipid-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have garnered significant interest for their potential use in a wide range of biomedical applications. In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations to study the equilibrium properties of SWNTs surrounded by the phosphatidylcholine (POPC) corona phase, and their interactions with three cell membrane disruptor peptides: colistin, TAT peptide, and crotamine-derived peptide. Our results show that SWNTs favor asymmetrical positioning within the POPC corona, so that one side of the SWNT, covered by the thinnest part of the corona, comes in contact with charged and polar functional groups of POPC and water. We also observed that colistin and TAT insert deeply into POPC corona, while crotamine-derived peptide only adsorbs to the corona surface. Compared to crotamine-derived peptide, colistin and TAT also induce larger perturbations in the thinnest region of the corona, by allowing more water molecules to directly contact the SWNT surface. In separate simulations, we show that three examined peptides exhibit similar insertion and adsorption behaviors when interacting with POPC bilayers, confirming that peptide-induced perturbations to POPC in conjugates and bilayers are similar in nature and magnitude. Furthermore, we observed correlations between the peptide-induced structural perturbations and the near-infrared emission of the lipid-functionalized SWNTs, which suggest that the optical signal of the conjugates transduces the morphological changes in the lipid corona. Overall, our findings indicate that lipid-functionalized SWNTs could serve as simplified cell membrane model systems for pre-screening of new antimicrobial compounds that disrupt cell membranes.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/525557v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (53K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4c5645org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b3cd30org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1643c6corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bb096e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Furthermore, to prove the modularity of the system, we engineered this mipCop to tune the expression of DTA (diphtheria toxin A) gene, and showed the powerful capacity of killing cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest based on miRNA response.

    "abstract": "Past reward associations may be signaled by stimuli from different sensory modalities, however it remains unclear how different types of reward-associated stimuli modulate perception. In this human fMRI study, we employed a paradigm involving a visual discrimination task, where a visual target was simultaneously presented with either an intra-(visual) or a cross-modal (auditory) cue that was previously associated with rewards. We hypothesized that depending on the sensory modality of the cues distinct neural pathways underlie the value-driven modulation of visual areas. Two steps of analyses were conducted: first, using a multivariate approach, we confirmed that previously reward-associated cues enhanced the target representation in the early visual areas. Then, using effective connectivity analysis, we tested three possible patterns of communication across the brain regions that could underlie the modulation of visual cortex: a direct pathway from the frontal valuation areas to the visual areas, a mediated pathway through the attention-related areas, and a mediated pathway that additionally involved distinct sensory association areas for auditory and visual rewards. We found evidence for the third model and demonstrate that reward-related information is communicated across the valuation and attention-related brain regions such as the intraparietal sulcus across for both visual and auditory cues. Additionally, the long-range communication of reward information also involved the superior temporal areas in case of auditory reward-associated stimuli. These results suggest that in the presence of previously rewarded stimuli from different sensory modalities, a combination of domain-general and domain-specific mechanisms are recruited across the brain to adjust visual processing.",

    "abstract": "Pro-inflammatory T cells co-express multiple chemokine receptors, but the distinct functions of individual receptors on these cells are largely unknown. Human Th17 cells uniformly express the chemokine receptor CCR6, and we discovered that the subgroup of CD4+CCR6+ cells that co-express CCR2 possess a pathogenic Th17 signature, can produce inflammatory cytokines independent of TCR activation, and are unusually efficient at transendothelial migration (TEM). The ligand for CCR6, CCL20, was capable of binding to activated endothelial cells (ECs) and inducing firm arrest of CCR6+CCR2+ cells under conditions of flow - but CCR6 could not mediate TEM. By contrast, CCL2 and other ligands for CCR2, despite being secreted from both luminal and basal sides of ECs, failed to bind to the EC surfaces - and CCR2 could not mediate arrest. Nonetheless, CCR2 was required for TEM. To understand if CCR2s inability to mediate arrest was due solely to an absence of EC-bound ligands, we generated a CCL2-CXCL9 chimeric chemokine that could bind to the EC surface. Although display of CCL2 on the ECs did indeed lead to CCR2-mediated arrest of CCR6+CCR2+ cells, activating CCR2 with surface-bound CCL2 blocked TEM. We conclude that mediating arrest and TEM are mutually exclusive activities of chemokine receptors and/or their ligands that depend, respectively, on chemokines that bind to the EC luminal surfaces versus non-binding chemokines that form transendothelial gradients under conditions of flow. Our findings provide fundamental insights into mechanisms of lymphocyte extravasation and may lead to novel strategies to block or enhance their migration into tissue.",

Whereas many studies have focused on cellular responses to acute and severe stresses, little is known about how cellular systems adapt to sublethal chronic stresses. Using mammalian cells in culture, we discovered that they adapt to chronic mild stresses, notably proteotoxic stresses such as heat, by increasing their size and translation, thereby scaling the amount of total protein. These adaptations render them more resilient to persistent and subsequent stresses. We demonstrate that Hsf1, well known for its role in acute stress responses, is required for the cell size increase, and that the molecular chaperone Hsp90 is essential for coupling the cell size increase to augmented translation. We term this translational reprogramming the \"rewiring stress response\", and propose that this protective process of chronic stress adaptation contributes to the increase in size as cells get older, and that its failure promotes aging.",
