    "abstract": "The visual cortex receives non-sensory inputs containing behavioral and brain state information. Here we propose a parallel between optogenetic and behavioral modulations of activity and characterize their impact on cell-type-specific V1 processing under a common theoretical framework. We infer cell-type-specific circuitry from large-scale V1 recordings and demonstrate that, given strong recurrent excitation, the cell-type-specific responses imply key aspects of the known connectivity. In the inferred models, parvalbumin-expressing (PV), but not other, interneurons have responses to perturbations that we show theoretically imply that their activity stabilizes the circuit. We infer inputs that explain locomotion-induced changes in firing rates and find that, contrary to hypotheses of simple disinhibition, locomotory drive to VIP cells and to SOM cells largely cancel, with enhancement of excitatory-cell visual responses likely due to direct locomotory drive to them. We show that this SOM/VIP cancellation is a property emerging from V1 connectivity structure.",

    "abstract": "Living in dynamic environments such as the social domain, where interaction with others determines the reproductive success of individuals, requires the ability to recognize opportunities to obtain natural rewards and cope with challenges that are associated with achieving them. As such, actions that promote survival and reproduction are reinforced by the brain reward system, whereas coping with the challenges associated with obtaining these rewards is mediated by stress-response pathways, the activation of which can impair health and shorten lifespan. While much research has been devoted to understanding mechanisms underlying the way by which natural rewards are processed by the reward system, less attention has been given to the consequences of failure to obtain a desirable reward. As a model system to study the impact of failure to obtain a natural reward, we used the well-established courtship suppression paradigm in Drosophila melanogaster as means to induce repeated failures to obtain sexual reward in male flies. We discovered that beyond the known reduction in courtship actions caused by interaction with non-receptive females, repeated failures to mate induce a stress response characterized by persistent motivation to obtain the sexual reward, reduced male-male social interaction, and enhanced aggression. This frustrative-like state caused by the conflict between high motivation to obtain sexual reward and the inability to fulfill their mating drive impairs the capacity of rejected males to tolerate stressors such as starvation and oxidative stress. We further show that sensitivity to starvation and enhanced social arousal is mediated by the disinhibition of a small population of neurons that express receptors for the fly homologue of neuropeptide Y. Our findings demonstrate for the first time the existence of social stress in flies and offers a framework to study mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between reward, stress, and reproduction in a simple nervous system that is highly amenable to genetic manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Spinally-projecting serotonergic neurons play a key role in controlling pain sensitivity and can either increase or decrease nociception depending on physiological context. It is currently unknown how serotonergic neurons mediate these opposing effects. Utilizing virus-based strategies, we identified two anatomically separated populations of serotonergic hindbrain neurons located in the lateral paragigantocellularis (LPGi) and the medial hindbrain, which respectively innervate the superficial and deep spinal dorsal horn and have contrasting effects on sensory perception. Our tracing experiments revealed that serotonergic neurons of the LPGi were much more susceptible to transduction with spinally injected AAV2retro vectors than medial hindbrain serotonergic neurons. Taking advantage of this difference, we employed intersectional chemogenetic approaches to demonstrate that activation of the LPGi serotonergic projections decreases thermal sensitivity, whereas activation of medial serotonergic neurons increases sensitivity to mechanical von Frey stimulation. Together these results suggest that there are functionally distinct classes of serotonergic hindbrain neurons that differ in their anatomical location in the hindbrain, their postsynaptic targets in the spinal cord, and their impact on nociceptive sensitivity. The LPGi neurons that give rise to rather global and bilateral projections throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the spinal cord appear to be ideally posed to contribute to widespread systemic pain control.",

    "abstract": "Methylation is a widely occurring modification that requires the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and acts in regulation of gene expression and other processes. SAM is synthesized from methionine, which is imported or generated through the 1-carbon cycle (1CC). Alterations in 1CC function have clear effects on lifespan and stress responses, but the wide distribution of this modification has made identification of specific mechanistic links difficult. Exploiting a dynamic stress-induced transcription model, we find that two SAM synthases in Caenorhabditis elegans, SAMS-1 and SAMS-4, contribute differently to modification of H3K4me3, gene expression and survival. We find that sams-4 enhances H3K4me3 in heat shocked animals lacking sams-1, however, sams-1 cannot compensate for sams-4, which is required to survive heat stress. This suggests that the regulatory functions of SAM depend on its enzymatic source and that provisioning of SAM may be an important regulatory step linking 1CC function to phenotypes in aging and stress.",

There is however accumulating evidence that transcriptional divergence might have a prominent role. Here, we show that yeast paralogous genes are more divergent in transcription than in translation. We explore two causal mechanisms for this predominance of transcriptional divergence: an evolutionary trade-off between the precision and economy of gene expression and a larger mutational target size for transcription. Performing simulations within a minimal model of post-duplication evolution, we find that both mechanisms are consistent with the observed divergence patterns. We also investigate how additional properties of the effects of mutations on gene expression, such as their asymmetry and correlation across levels of regulation, can shape the evolution of duplicates. Our results highlight the importance of fully characterizing the distributions of mutational effects on transcription and translation. They also show how general trade-offs in cellular processes and mutation bias can have far-reaching evolutionary impacts.",

Due to this close-knit association, there is considerable interest to engineer them for healthcare applications in both humans and animals, for which high-performance and versatile genetic parts are greatly desired. For the first time, we describe two genetic modules in Lactiplantibacillus plantarum that achieve high-level gene expression using plasmids that can be retained without antibiotics, bacteriocins or genomic manipulations. These include (i) a promoter, PtlpA, from a phylogenetically distant bacterium, Salmonella typhimurium, that drives up to 5-fold higher level of gene expression compared to previously reported promoters and (ii) multiple toxin-antitoxin systems as a self-contained and easy-to-implement plasmid retention strategy that facilitates the engineering of tunable transient Genetically Modified Organisms. These modules and the fundamental factors underlying their functionality that are described in this work will greatly contribute to expanding the genetic programmability of lactobacilli for healthcare applications.",

The origin of bat flight is still not fully understood due to an uninformative fossil record, but it is widely hypothesized that bats evolved from gliding ancestors. Here, we test predictions of the gliding-to-flying hypothesis of the origin of bat flight by using phylogenetic comparative methods to model the evolution of forelimb and hind limb traits on a dataset spanning four extinct bats and 231 extant mammals with diverse locomotor regimes. Our results reveal gliders elongate forelimb adaptive optima to be intermediate between those of bats and non-gliding arborealists. Our results also show that gliders and bats share an adaptive zone characterized by elongate and narrow hind limb bones. We propose a hypothetical adaptive landscape based on skeletal length and width optima trends, which we interpret within our robust mammal limb dataset. Our results support the potential for glider-like postcranial morphology to evolve into bat-like morphology prior to powered-flight behavior, setting a foundation for future developmental, biomechanical, and evolutionary research to test this idea.",

Moreover, cognitive control mechanisms, including memory and attention, exert top-down influences on the perceptual system during mental images generation. However, it is unclear whether such top-down processing is content-specific or not. Feature integration and top-down processing involve short-range connectivity within visual areas, and long-range connectivity between control and visual areas, respectively. Here, we used a minimally constrained experimental paradigm wherein imagery categories were prompted using visual word cues only, and we decoded face versus place imagery based on their underlying connectivity patterns. Our results show that face and place imagery can be decoded from both short-range and long-range connections. These findings suggest that feature integration does not require an external stimulus but occurs also for purely internally generated images. Furthermore, control and visual areas exchange information specifically tailored to imagery content.\n\nTeaserDecoding visual imagery from brain connectivity reveals a content-specific interconnected neural code for internal image generation.",

To answer this question, museum objects varying in material and size from two museums, the Museum fur Naturkunde and the Pergamonmuseum in Berlin, Germany, which forms part of UNESCO World Heritage since 1999, were defined. In total 126 samples of natural and cultural heritage objects were taken with sterile nylon flocked swabs and subsequently subjected to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. By comparing the microbial composition of touched and untouched mollusc and fossil natural heritage objects we derived a robust microbial touch signature characterized by increased abundance of microbes known to be present in human skin. Application of this touch signature to cultural heritage objects from the Pergamonmuseum revealed areas of differential exposure to human contact on the Ishtar gate and Samal gate lions. Moreover, we were able to distinguish museum objects and personal office items touched by two different individuals with high sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that the microbial composition of museum objects gives insight into the degree of exposure to human contact, which is an important parameter for conservation and heritage science, and possibly provenance research.",

We demonstrate that at least one of these sarbecoviruses can bind and use the human ACE2 receptor for infecting human cells, albeit suboptimally. Additionally, the spike proteins of these sarbecoviruses possess an R-A-K-Q motif, which lies only one nucleotide mutation away from a furin cleavage site (FCS) that enhances infectivity in other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. However, mutating this motif to an FCS does not enable spike cleavage. Overall, while UK sarbecoviruses would require further molecular adaptations to infect humans, their zoonotic risk is unknown and warrants closer surveillance.",

Here, we examine how the seasonal patterns of ant activity--key drivers of terrestrial ecosystem functioning--vary with human-induced land cover change on a subtropical island landscape. Using trap captures sampled biweekly from a biodiversity monitoring network covering Okinawa Island, Japan, we processed 1.2 million individuals and reconstructed activity patterns within and across habitat types. Forest communities exhibited greater variability than those in more developed areas. Using time-series decomposition to deconstruct this pattern, we found that ant communities at sites with greater human development exhibited diminished seasonality, reduced synchrony, and higher stochasticity compared to those at sites with greater forest cover. Our results cannot be explained by variation in either regional or in situ temperature patterns, or by differences in species richness or composition among sites. We conclude that the breakdown of natural seasonal patterns of functionally key insect communities may comprise an important and underappreciated consequence of global environmental change that must be better understood across Earths biomes.",

Here we demonstrate that history biases and apparent lapses can both arise from a common cognitive process that is normative under misbeliefs about non-stationarity in the world. This corresponds to an accumulation- to-bound model with history-dependent updates to the initial state of the accumulator. We test our models predictions about the relative prevalence of history biases and lapses, and show that they are robustly borne out in two distinct rat decision-making datasets, including data from a novel reaction time task. Our model improves the ability to precisely predict decision-making dynamics within and across trials, by positing a process through which agents can generate quasi-stochastic choices.",

Moreover, heterozygous reeler mice exhibit features reminiscent of these disorders, while overexpression of Reelin protects against its manifestation. However, how Reelin influences the structure and circuits of the striatal complex, a key region for the above-mentioned disorders, is far from being understood, especially when altered Reelin expression levels are found at adult stages. In the present study, we took advantage of complementary conditional gain- and loss-of-function mouse models to investigate how Reelin levels may modify adult brains striatal structure and neuronal composition. Using immunohistochemical techniques, we determined that Reelin does not seem to influence the striatal patch and matrix organization (studied by -opioid receptor immunohistochemistry) nor the density of medium spiny neurons (MSNs, studied with DARPP-32). We show that overexpression of Reelin leads to increased numbers of striatal Parvalbumin- and Cholinergic-interneurons, and to a slight increase in the tyrosine hydroxylase-positive projections. We conclude that increased Reelin levels might modulate the numbers of striatal interneurons and the density of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic projections, suggesting that these changes may be involved in the protection of Reelin against neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Majority (n=54) of the isolates were carbapenem-resistant, particularly the IC7 (100%) and IC9 (>91.7%) strains. blaOXA-23 (34.9%) and blaNDM-1 (27.9%) were the most common carbapenem resistance genes detected. All blaOXA-23 genes were carried on Tn2006 or Tn2006-like transposons. Our findings suggest that the mobilisation of a 10kb Tn125 composite transposon is the primary means of blaNDM-1 dissemination.\n\nConclusionOur findings highlight an increase in blaNDM-1 prevalence and the widespread transposon-facilitated dissemination of carbapenemase genes in diverse A. baumannii lineages in southwestern Nigeria. We make the case for improving surveillance of these pathogens in Nigeria and other understudied settings.\n\nImportanceAcinetobacter baumannii are increasingly clinically relevant due to their propensity to harbour genes conferring resistance to multiple antimicrobials, as well as their ability to persist and disseminate in hospital environments and cause difficult-to-treat nosocomial infections. Little is known about the molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance profiles of these organisms in Nigeria, largely due to limited capacity for their isolation, identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Our study characterised the diversity and antimicrobial resistance profiles of clinical A. baumannii in southwestern Nigeria using whole-genome sequencing. We also identified the key genetic elements facilitating the dissemination of carbapenem resistance genes within this species. This study provides key insights into the clinical burden and population dynamics of A. baumannii in hospitals in Nigeria and highlights the importance of routine whole-genome sequencing-based surveillance of this and other previously understudied pathogens in Nigeria and other similar settings.",

    "abstract": "Primary motor cortex (M1) exhibits a protracted period of development that includes the establishment of a somatosensory map long before motor outflow emerges. In rats, the sensory representation is established by postnatal day (P) 8 when cortical activity is still \"discontinuous.\" Here, we ask how the representation survives the sudden transition to noisy \"continuous\" activity at P12. Using neural decoding to predict forelimb movements based solely on M1 activity, we show that a linear decoder is sufficient to predict limb movements at P8, but not at P12; in contrast, a nonlinear decoder effectively predicts limb movements at P12. The change in decoder performance at P12 reflects an increase in both the complexity and uniqueness of kinematic information available in M1. We next show that the representation at P12 is more susceptible to the deleterious effects of \"lesioning\" inputs and to \"transplanting\" M1s encoding scheme from one pup to another. We conclude that the emergence of continuous cortical activity signals the developmental onset in M1 of more complex, informationally sparse, and individualized sensory representations.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis is the most used illicit drug in the United States. With many states passing legislation to permit its recreational use, there is concern that cannabis use among adolescents could increase dramatically in the coming years. Historically, it has been difficult to model real-world cannabis use to investigate the causal relationship between cannabis use in adolescence and behavioral and neurobiological effects in adulthood. To this end, we used a novel volitional vapor administration model to investigate long-term effects of cannabis use during adolescence on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and mPFC-dependent behaviors in male and female rats. Adolescent (35-55 day old) female rats had significantly higher rates of responding for vaporized {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-dominant cannabis extract (CANTHC) compared to adolescent males. In adulthood (70-110 day old), female, but not male, CANTHC rats also took more trials to reach criterion and made more regressive errors in an automated attentional set-shifting task compared to vehicle rats. Similar set-shifting deficits were observed in males when they were exposed to a non-contingent CANTHC vapor dosing regimen that approximated CANTHC self-administration rates in females. No differences were observed in effort-based decision making in either sex. In the mPFC, female (but not male) CANTHC rats displayed more reactive microglia with no significant changes in myelin basic protein expression or dendritic spine density. Together, these data reveal important sex differences in rates of cannabis vapor self-administration in adolescence that confer enduring alterations to mPFC structure and function. Importantly, female-specific deficits in behavioral flexibility appear to be driven by elevated rates of CANTHC self-administration as opposed to a sex difference in the effects of CANTHC vapor per se.",

    "abstract": "In humans, early life stress (ELS) is associated with an increased risk for developing both alcohol use disorder (AUD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We have previously used an infant footshock model to explore this shared predisposition. Infant footshock produces stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL) in rats and mice and increases aversion-resistant alcohol drinking in rats. The goal of the current study was to extend this model of comorbid PTSD and AUD to male and female C57BL/6J mice. Acute ELS was induced using 15 foot-shocks on postnatal day 17. In adulthood, after PND 90, ethanol drinking behavior was tested in one of three two-bottle choice drinking paradigms: continuous access, limited access drinking in the dark, or intermittent access. In continuous access, mice were given 24 h access to 5% or 10% ethanol and water. Each ethanol concentration was provided for five consecutive drinking sessions. In limited access drinking in the dark, mice were given 2 h of access to 15% ethanol and water across 15 sessions. Ethanol was provided 3 h into the dark cycle to maximize task engagement when mice are most active. In intermittent access, mice were presented with 20% ethanol and water Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, for four consecutive weeks. In a fifth week of intermittent access drinking, increasing concentrations of quinine (10 mg/L, 100 mg/L, and 200 mg/L) were added to the ethanol to test aversion-resistant drinking. Our results indicate that infant footshock does not influence adult ethanol consumption in mice. Infant footshock did not affect ethanol-only consumption or preference in any of the three drinking paradigms. Further, and in contrast to our previous results in rats, infant footshock did not appear to influence consumption of quinine-adulterated ethanol. The biological sex of the mice did affect ethanol-only consumption in all three drinking paradigms, with females consuming more ethanol than males. Preference for ethanol vs. water was higher in females only under continuous access conditions. Our results suggest that infant footshock alone may not be sufficient to increase drinking levels in mice. We hypothesize that infant footshock may require a secondary, adolescent stress exposure to influence ethanol drinking behavior. Further research is needed to create a valid model of PTSD-AUD comorbidity in male and female mice.",

MS is a primary demyelinating, chronic, inmune and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that normally debuts in young adults. The currently available therapeutic arsenal to treat MS is composed of immunomodulators but, to date, there are no (re)myelinating drugs available in clinics. Our present study shows cells expressing TLR4 in demyelinating lesions of MS patients (postmortem samples from cerebral cortex) and, as a derivative, we studied the effect of TLR4 inhibition with ApTOLL in animal models of MS (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis -EAE- and the cuprizone). The treatment with ApTOLL positively impacted the clinical symptomatology, and this was associated with better preservation plus restoration of myelin and oligodendrocytes in the demyelinated lesions of these animals, which suggests not only an immunomodulatory but also a remyelinating effect of the treatment with ApTOLL. This latter was corroborated on purified cultures of rodent and adult human oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), confirming the expression of TLR4 in this cell type. Altogether, the molecular nature of ApTOLL and its mechanism/s of action strongly supports this compound as a novel candidate to treat MS and other demyelinating scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is an evolving ability that significantly impacts human learning and cognition. Early development of ToM ability allow one to comprehend other peoples aims and ambitions, as well as thinking that differs from ones own. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is the prevalent pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder in which participants brains appeared to be marked by diffuse variations throughout large-scale brain systems made up of functionally connected but physically separated brain areas that got abnormalities in willed action, self-monitoring and monitoring the intents of others, often known as ToM. Although functional neuroimaging techniques have been widely used to establish the neural correlates implicated in ToM, the specific mechanisms still need to be clarified. The availability of current Big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) frameworks paves the way for systematically identifying Autistics from typically developing by identifying neural correlates and connectome-based features to generate accurate classifications and predictions of socio-cognitive impairment. In this work, we develop an Ex-AI model that quantifies the common sources of variability in ToM brain regions between typically developing and ASD individuals. Our results identify a feature set on which the classification model can be trained to learn characteristics differences and classify ASD and TD ToM development more distinctly. This approach can also estimate heterogeneity within ASD ToM subtypes and their association with the symptom severity scores based on socio-cognitive impairments. Based on our proposed framework, we obtain an average accuracy of more than 90 % using Explainable ML (Ex-Ml) models and an average of 96 % classification accuracy using Explainable Deep Neural Network (Ex-DNN) models. Our findings identify three important sub-groups within ASD samples based on the key differences and heterogeneity in resting state ToM regions functional connectivity patterns and predictive of mild to severe atypical social cognition and communication deficits through early developmental stages.",

    "abstract": "Selecting suitable grasps on three-dimensional objects is a challenging visuomotor computation, which involves combining information about an object (e.g., its shape, size, and mass) with information about the actors body (e.g., the optimal grasp aperture and hand posture for comfortable manipulation). Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate brain networks associated with these distinct aspects during grasp planning and execution. Human participants viewed and then executed preselected grasps on L-shaped objects made of wood and/or brass. By leveraging a computational approach that accurately predicts human grasp locations, we selected grasp points that disentangled the role of multiple grasp-relevant factors: grasp axis, grasp size, and object mass. Representational Similarity Analysis revealed that grasp axis was encoded along dorsal-stream regions during grasp planning. Grasp size was first encoded in ventral-stream areas during grasp planning, then in premotor regions during grasp execution. Object mass was encoded in ventral-stream and (pre)motor regions only during grasp execution. Premotor regions further encoded visual predictions of grasp comfort, whereas the ventral stream encoded grasp comfort during execution, suggesting its involvement in haptic evaluation. These shifts in neural representations thus capture the sensorimotor transformations that allow humans to grasp objects.\n\nSignificance StatementGrasping requires integrating object properties with constraints on hand and arm postures. Using a computational approach that accurately predicts human grasp locations by combining such constraints, we selected grasps on objects that disentangled the relative contributions of object mass, grasp size, and grasp axis during grasp planning and execution in a neuroimaging study. Our findings reveal a greater role of dorsal-stream visuomotor areas during grasp planning, and surprisingly, increasing ventral stream engagement during execution. We propose that during planning, visuomotor representations initially encode grasp axis and size. Perceptual representations of object material properties become more relevant instead as the hand approaches the object and motor programs are refined with estimates of the grip forces required to successfully lift the object.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a painless non-invasive method that allows focal activation or deactivation of a human brain region in order to assess effects on other brain regions. As such, it has a unique role in elucidating brain connectivity during behavior and at rest. Information regarding brain connectivity derived from TMS experiments has been published in hundreds of papers but is not accessible in aggregate.\n\nObjectiveOur objective was to identify, extract, and represent TMS-connectivity data in a graph database. This approach uses nodes connected by edges to capture the directed nature of interregional communication in the brain while also being flexible enough to contain other information about the connections, such as the source of information and details about the experiments that produced them.\n\nMethodsData related to interregional brain connectivity is first extracted from full-text publications, with creation of a table-like structure that list data of multiple types, principally the source and target brain regions, sign (excitatory/inhibitory) and latency. While machine-reading methods were explored, so far human experts have had to extract and verify data. These data are used to populate a neo4j graph database. A graphical user interface coupled with a query system allows users to search for networks and display information about connections between any two brain regions of interest.\n\nResultsExperiments involving two TMS stimulating coils, in which one is over a putative source region and the other is over another region with a measurable effect in the body (such as the primary motor cortex) are the most straightforward to represent in the database. Even in those experiments, differing conventions for naming regions, and differing experimental parameters such as stimulation intensity and coil position, create issues for representing data from multiple studies in the same database. Other types of experiments, such a neuromodulatory stimulation such as rTMS, can provide information regarding connectivity, but are harder to represent. But we have, thus far, stored information about 100 connections in the database and demonstrated its utility in exploring direct and indirect connections between brain regions. We have also explored adding a causal inference method to those connections, allowing information about latency to shape the connections retrieved given latency limits.\n\nConclusionA graph database can flexibly store information about interregional brain connectivity and is particularly useful for exploring the temporal aspects of brain networks.",

    "abstract": "Microbial pathogens use proteases for their infections, such as digestion of proteins for nutrients and activation of their virulence factors. As an obligate intracellular parasite, Toxoplasma gondii must invade host cells to establish its intracellular propagation. To facilitate invasion, the parasites secrete invasion effectors from microneme and rhoptry, two unique organelles in apicomplexans. Previous work has shown that some micronemal invasion effectors experience a series of proteolytic cleavages within the parasites secretion pathway for maturation, such as the aspartyl protease (TgASP3) and the cathepsin L-like protease (TgCPL), localized within the post-Golgi compartment (1) and the endolysosomal system (2), respectively. Furthermore, it has been shown that the precise maturation of micronemal effectors is critical for Toxoplasma invasion and egress (1). Here, we show that an endosome-like compartment (ELC)-residing cathepsin C-like protease (TgCPC1) mediates the final trimming of some micronemal effectors, and its loss further results in defects in the steps of invasion, egress, and migration throughout the parasites lytic cycle. Notably, the deletion of TgCPC1 completely blocks the activation of subtilisin-like protease 1 (TgSUB1) in the parasites, which globally impairs the surface-trimming of many key micronemal invasion and egress effectors. Additionally, we found that TgCPC1 was not efficiently inhibited by the chemical inhibitor targeting its malarial ortholog, suggesting that these cathepsin C-like orthologs are structurally different within the apicomplexan phylum. Taken together, our findings identify a novel function of TgCPC1 in the processing of micronemal proteins within the secretory pathway of Toxoplasma parasites and expand the understanding of the roles of cathepsin C protease.\n\nIMPORTANCEToxoplasma gondii is a microbial pathogen that is well adapted for disseminating infections. It can infect virtually all warm-blooded animals. Approximately one-third of the human population carries toxoplasmosis. During infection, the parasites sequentially secrete protein effectors from the microneme, rhoptry, and dense granule, three organelles exclusively found in apicomplexan parasites, to help establish their lytic cycle. Proteolytic cleavage of these secretory proteins is required for the parasites optimal function. Previous work has revealed that two proteases residing within the parasites secretory pathway cleave micronemal and rhoptry proteins, which mediate parasite invasion and egress. Here, we demonstrate that a cathepsin C-like protease (TgCPC1) is involved in processing several invasion and egress effectors. The genetic deletion of TgCPC1 prevented the complete maturation of some effectors in the parasites. Strikingly, the deletion led to a full inactivation of one surface-anchored protease, which globally impaired the trimming of some key micronemal proteins before secretion. Therefore, this finding represents a novel post-translational mechanism for the processing of virulence factors within microbial pathogens.",

The canonical member, DUX4, is involved in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) and cancer, when misexpressed in other contexts. We evaluate the 3 human DUX genes and the ancestral single homeobox gene sDUX from the non-eutherian mammal, platypus, and find that DUX4 activities are not shared with DUXA or DUXB, which lack transcriptional activation potential, but surprisingly are shared with platypus sDUX. In human myoblasts, platypus sDUX drives cytotoxicity, inhibits myogenesis, and induces DUX4 target genes, particularly those associated with zygotic genome activation (ZGA), by binding DNA as a homodimer in a way that overlaps the DUX4 homeodomain crystal structure. DUXA lacks transcriptional activity but has DNA-binding and chromatin accessibility overlap with DUX4 and sDUX, including on ZGA genes and LTR elements, and can actually be converted into a DUX4-like cytotoxic factor by fusion to a synthetic transactivation domain. DUXA competition antagonizes the activity of DUX4 on its target genes, including in FSHD patient cells. Since DUXA is an early DUX4 target gene, this activity potentiates feedback inhibition, constraining the window of DUX4 activity. The DUX gene family therefore comprises cross-regulating members of opposing function, with implications for their roles in ZGA, FSHD, and cancer.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIPlatypus sDUX is toxic and inhibits myogenic differentiation.\nC_LIO_LIDUXA targets overlap substantially with those of DUX4.\nC_LIO_LIDUXA fused to a synthetic transactivation domain acquires DUX4-like toxicity.\nC_LIO_LIDUXA behaves as a competitive inhibitor of DUX4.\nC_LI",

Several cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) have been implicated; however, their regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, the Phytophthora infestans RXLR effector AVRblb2 family targeted NbCNGC18-20 at the plasma membrane, inhibiting Ca2+ influx and PTI. AVRblb2 required calmodulin (CaM) and calmodulin-like (CML) proteins as co-factors to interact with N. benthamiana CNGCs (NbCNGCs), forming the AVRblb2-CaM/CML-NbCNGCs complex. After recognizing PAMPs, NbCNGC18 formed active heteromeric channels with other CNGCs, potentially providing selectivity for diverse signals to fine-tune cytosolic Ca2+ levels and responses. AVRblb2 suppressed the Ca2+ influx and oxidative burst induced by NbCNGC18 heteromeric complexes. Silencing CNGC18, CNGC20, and CNGC25 compromised the effect of AVRblb2 on P. infestans virulence, confirming that AVRblb2 contributed to virulence by targeting CNGCs.

In vision, this can be achieved by attending to a spatial location or a defining feature (e.g. colour). Spatial attention can be conceived as a spotlight in 2D space, whose focus can differ in breadth and concentration. Could attention to colour also function as a spotlight that highlights an area of colour space? We examined this in an experiment that used multicoloured displays with four overlapping random dot kinematograms (RDKs) that differed only in hue. We manipulated (1) requirement to focus attention to a single colour (red or green) or divide it between two colours (red and green); (2) distances of distractor hues from target hues. This resulted in three different colour contexts, which differed in proximity between targets and distractors. We conducted a behavioural and an electroencephalographic experiment, in which each colour was tagged by a specific flicker frequency and driving its own steady-state visual evoked potential. Behavioural and neural indices of attention showed several major consistencies. Concurrent selection of red and green reduced the efficiency of target enhancement and produced context-dependent distractor interference, consistent with a combination of two hue-selective spotlights of unchanged breadth but reduced concentration. This conceptual similarity in implementation of spatial and feature-based selection implies that attentional modulation of signals in biological systems is likely to be implemented using the same domain-general selective mechanisms, which are well-described with a spotlight metaphor.\n\nSignificance statementAttention selection of spatial locations and visual features (e.g. colour) is implemented through different neural mechanisms - spatial attention selects all features in the attended location, while feature-based attention selects attended features across the visual field. However, these selection mechanisms also share similarities. Our study on colour-based attention demonstrates that the spotlight metaphor applied in hue-space can adequately explain obtained patterns of behavioural and neurophysiological data. This hints at universal, domain-general mechanisms of selection, determining its efficiency relative to the number of to-be-selected targets and their proximity to other elements in the scene, be it by spatial location or distance (i.e. similarity) in featural space.",

    "abstract": "Visual images perceived by humans can be reconstructed from their brain activity. However, the visualization (externalization) of mental imagery remains a challenge. In this study, we demonstrated that the visual image reconstruction method proposed in the seminal study by Shen et al. (2019) heavily relied on low-level visual information decoded from the brain and could not efficiently utilize semantic information that would be recruited during mental imagery. To address this limitation, we extended the previous method to a Bayesian estimation framework and introduced the assistance of semantic information into it. Our proposed framework successfully reconstructed both seen (i.e., directly captured by the human eye) and imagined images from the brain activity. These results suggest that our framework would provide a technology for directly investigating the subjective contents of the brain.",

Here, we describe the molecular profile of a thermosensory neuron pair in C. elegans experiencing different temperature stimuli.

Expression changes are driven by broadly expressed activity-dependent transcription factors and corresponding cis-regulatory elements that nevertheless direct neuron- and stimulus-specific gene expression programs.

    "abstract": "Humans effortlessly make quick and accurate perceptual decisions about the nature of their immediate visual environment, such as the category of the scene they face. Previous research has revealed a rich set of cortical representations potentially underlying this feat. However, it remains unknown which of these representations are suitably formatted for decision-making. Here, we approached this question empirically and computationally, using neuroimaging and computational modelling. For the empirical part, we collected electroencephalography (EEG) data and reaction times from human participants during a scene categorization task (natural vs. man-made). We then related neural representations to behaviour using a multivariate extension of signal detection theory. We observed a correlation specifically between [~]100 ms and [~]200 ms after stimulus onset, suggesting that the neural scene representations in this time period are suitably formatted for decision-making. For the computational part, we evaluated a recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) as a model of brain and behaviour. Unifying our previous observations in an image-computable model, the RCNN predicted well the neural representations, the behavioural scene categorization data, as well as the relationship between them. Our results identify and computationally characterize the neural and behavioural correlates of scene categorization in humans.\n\nSignificance statementCategorizing scene information is a ubiquitous and crucial task. Here we provide an empirical and computational account of scene categorization. Previous research has identified when scenes are represented in the visual processing hierarchy, but it remains unclear which of these representations are relevant for behaviour. We identified such representations between [~]100 ms and [~]200 ms after stimulus onset. We then showed that scene categorization in humans can be modelled via a recurrent convolutional neural network in a unified manner, i.e., in terms of neural and behavioural correlates, and their relationship. Together this reveals which representations underlie scene categorization behaviour and proposes a computational mechanism that implements such representations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLongitudinal analysis of multivariate individual-specific microbiome profiles over time or across conditions remains a daunting task. The vast majority of statistical tools and methods available to study the microbiota are based upon cross-sectional data. Over the past few years, several attempts have been made to model the dynamics of bacterial species over time or across conditions. However, the field needs novel views on how to incorporate individual-specific microbial associations in temporal analyses when the focus lies on microbial interactions.\n\nResultsHere, we propose a novel data analysis framework, called MNDA, to uncover taxon neighbourhood dynamics that combines representation learning and individual-specific microbiome co-occurrence networks. We show that tracking local neighbourhood dynamics in microbiome interaction or co-occurrence networks can yield complementary information to standard approaches that only use microbial abundances or pairwise microbial interactions. We use cohort data on infants for whom microbiome data was available at 6 and 9 months after birth, as well as information on mode of delivery and diet changes over time. In particular, MNDA-based prediction models outperform traditional prediction models based on individual-specific abundances, and enable the detection of microbes whose neighbourhood dynamics are informative of clinical variables. We further show that similarity analyses of individuals based on microbial neighbourhood dynamics can be used to find subpopulations of individuals with potential relevance to clinical practice. The annotated source code for the MNDA framework can be downloaded from: https://github.com/H2020TranSYS/microbiome_dynamics\n\nConclusionsMNDA extracts information from matched microbiome profiles and opens new avenues to personalized prediction or stratified medicine with temporal microbiome data.",

    "abstract": "Genetic polymorphisms in nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1), a key transcriptional regulator of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, have been linked to diabetes. Homozygous deletion of NRF-1 is embryonic lethal. Our goal was to generate mice with {beta}-cell-specific reduction in NRF-1 function to investigate the relationship between NRF-1 and diabetes. We report the generation of mice expressing a dominant-negative allele of NRF-1 (DNNRF-1) in pancreatic {beta}-cells. Heterozygous transgenic mice had high fed blood glucose levels detected at 3 wks of age, which persisted through adulthood. Plasma insulin levels in DNNRF-1 transgenic mice were reduced, while insulin sensitivity remained intact in young animals. Islet size was reduced with increased numbers of apoptotic cells, and insulin content in islets by immunohistochemistry was low. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in isolated islets was reduced in DNNRF-1-mice, but partially rescued by KCl, suggesting that decreased mitochondrial function contributed to the insulin secretory defect. Electron micrographs demonstrated abnormal mitochondrial morphology in {beta}-cells. Expression of NRF-1 target genes Tfam, Tfb1m and Tfb2m, and islet cytochrome c oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase activities were reduced in DNNRF-1-mice. Rescue of mitochondrial function with low level activation of transgenic c-Myc in {beta}-cells was sufficient to restore {beta}-cell mass and prevent diabetes. This study demonstrates that reduced NRF-1 function can lead to loss of {beta}-cell function and establishes a model to study the interplay between regulators of bi-genomic gene transcription in diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria make a living oxidizing ammonium with nitrite as electron acceptor, intermediates nitric oxide and hydrazine, and end product dinitrogen gas. Hydrazine is a biologically unique free intermediate in this metabolism, and is produced by the enzyme hydrazine synthase. Crystallization of  Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis hydrazine synthase allowed for an initial hypothesis of its reaction mechanism. In this hypothesis, nitric oxide is first reduced to hydroxylamine after which hydroxylamine is condensed with ammonium to form hydrazine. Hydrazine synthase is a tetraheme cytochrome c, containing two proposed active site hemes ({gamma}I & I) in the {gamma}- and -subunit, respectively, connected by an intra-enzymatic tunnel. Here we combined the data from electrochemistry-induced Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, EPR and optical spectroscopy to shed light on the redox properties and protein dynamics of hydrazine synthase in the context of its reaction mechanism. Redox titrations revealed two low potential low spin hemes with midpoint potentials of [~]-360 mV and [~]-310 mV for heme II and {gamma}II, respectively. Heme {gamma}I showed redox transitions in the range of 0 mV, consisting of both low spin and high spin characteristics in optical and EPR spectroscopy. Electrochemistry-induced FTIR spectroscopy indicated an aspartic acid ligating a OH-/H2O at the heme {gamma}I axial site as a possible candidate for involvement in this mixed spin characteristic. Furthermore, EPR spectroscopy confirmed the ability of heme {gamma}I to bind NO in the reduced state. Heme I exhibited a rhombic high spin signal, in line with its ligation by a proximal tyrosine observed in the crystal structure. Redox titrations down to -610 mV nor addition of dithionite resulted in the reduction of heme I, indicating a very low midpoint potential for this heme. In vivo chemistry at this heme I, the candidate for the comproportionation of hydroxylamine and ammonium, is thus likely to be initiated solely on the oxidized heme, in contrast to previously reported DFT calculations. The reduction potentials of the {gamma}-subunit hemes were in line with the proposed electron transfer of heme {gamma}II to heme {gamma}I for the reduction of NO to hydroxylamine (E0 = - 30 mV).",

    "abstract": "MotivationEvolutionary inferences depend crucially on the quality of multiple sequence alignments (MSA), which is problematic for distantly related proteins. Since protein structure is more conserved than protein sequence, it seems natural to use structure alignments for distant homologs. However, structure alignments may not be suitable for inferring evolutionary relationships at the sequence level.\n\nResultsHere we investigate the mutual relationships between four protein similarity measures that depend on sequence and structure (fraction of aligned residues, sequence similarity, fraction of superimposed backbones and contact overlap) and the corresponding alignments. Changes in protein sequences and structures are intimately correlated, but our results suggest that no individual measure can provide a complete and unbiased picture of changes in protein sequences and structure. Therefore, we propose a new hybrid measure of protein sequence and structure similarity based on Principal Components (PC_sim). Starting from an MSA, we obtain modified pairwise alignments (PA) based on PC_sim, and from them we construct a new MSA based on the maximal cliques of the PA graph. These alignments yield larger protein similarities and agree better with the Balibase \"reference\" MSA and with consensus MSA than alignments that target individual similarity measures. Moreover, PC_sim is associated with a divergence measure that correlates strongest with divergences obtained from individual similarities, which suggests that it can infer more accurate evolutionary divergences for the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees with distance methods.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/ugobas/Evol_div\n\nContactubastolla@cbm.csic.es",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in molecular modeling of protein structures are changing the field of structural biology. AlphaFold-2 (AF2), an AI system developed by DeepMind, Inc., utilizes attention-based deep learning to predict models of protein structures with high accuracy relative to structures determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM). Comparing AF2 models to structures determined using solution NMR data, both high similarities and distinct differences have been observed. Since AF2 was trained on X-ray crystal and cryoEM structures, we assessed how accurately AF2 can model small, monomeric, solution protein NMR structures which (i) were not used in the AF2 training data set, and (ii) did not have homologous structures in the Protein Data Bank at the time of AF2 training. We identified nine open source protein NMR data sets for such \"blind\" targets, including chemical shift, raw NMR FID data, NOESY peak lists, and (for 1 case) 15N-1H residual dipolar coupling data. For these nine small (70 - 108 residues) monomeric proteins, we generated AF2 prediction models and assessed how well these models fit to these experimental NMR data, using several well-established NMR structure validation tools. In most of these cases, the AF2 models fit the NMR data nearly as well, or sometimes better than, the corresponding NMR structure models previously deposited in the Protein Data Bank. These results provide benchmark NMR data for assessing new NMR data analysis and protein structure prediction methods. They also document the potential for using AF2 as a guiding tool in protein NMR data analysis, and more generally for hypothesis generation in structural biology research.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAF2 models assessed against NMR data for 9 monomeric proteins not used in training.\nC_LIO_LIAF2 models fit NMR data almost as well as the experimentally-determined structures.\nC_LIO_LIRPF-DP, PSVS, and PDBStat software provide structure quality and RDC assessment.\nC_LIO_LIRPF-DP analysis using AF2 models suggests multiple conformational states.\nC_LI\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=63 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/525096v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@be0a41org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9336e9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fa1d24org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8f4efe_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Helical homopolymers of multiheme cytochromes catalyze biogeochemically significant electron transfers with a reported 103-fold variation in conductivity. Herein, classical molecular dynamics and hybrid quantum/classical molecular mechanics are used to elucidate the structural determinants of the redox potentials and conductivities of the tetra-, hexa-, and octaheme outer-membrane cytochromes E, S, and Z, respectively, from Geobacter sulfurreducens. Second-sphere electrostatic interactions acting on minimally polarized heme centers are found to regulate redox potentials over a computed 0.5-V range. However, the energetics of redox conduction are largely robust to the structural diversity: Single-step electronic couplings ([&lt;]Hmn[&gt;]), reaction free energies [Formula], and reorganization energies ({lambda}mn) are always respectively <|0.026|, <|0.26|, and between 0.5 - 1.0 eV. With these conserved parameter ranges, redox conductivity differed by less than a factor of 10 among the  nanowires and is sufficient to meet the demands of cellular respiration if 102 - 103  nanowires are expressed. The  nanowires are proposed to be differentiated by the protein packaging to interface with a great variety of environments, and not by conductivity, because the rate-limiting electron transfers are elsewhere in the respiratory process. Conducting-probe atomic force microscopy measurements that find conductivities 103-106-fold more than cellular demands are suggested to report on functionality that is either not used or not accessible under physiological conditions. The experimentally measured difference in conductivity between Omc- S and Z is suggested to not be an intrinsic feature of the CryoEM-resolved structures.",

    "abstract": "Transactive response element DNA/RNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) is the causative protein of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); several ALS-associated mutants of TDP-43 have been identified. TDP-43 has several domains: an N-terminal domain, two RNA/DNA-recognition motifs, and a C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Its structures have been partially determined, but the whole structure remains elusive. In this study, we investigate the possible end-to-end distance between the N- and C-termini of TDP-43, its alterations due to ALS-associated mutations in the IDR, and its apparent molecular shape in live cells using Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). Further-more, the interaction between ALS-associated TDP-43 and heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is slightly stronger than that of wild-type TDP-43. Our findings provide insights into the structure of wild-type and ALS-associated mutants of TDP-43 in a cell.",

    "abstract": "Androgen has long been recognized for its pivotal role in the sexual dimorphism of cardiovascular diseases, including aortic aneurysms, a devastating vascular disease with a higher prevalence and mortality rate in men than women. However, the molecular mechanism by which androgen mediates aortic aneurysms is largely unknown. Here, we report that male but not female mice develop aortic aneurysms in response to aldosterone and high salt (Aldo-salt). We demonstrate that both androgen and androgen receptors (AR) are crucial for the sexually dimorphic response to Aldo-salt. We identify T cells expressing programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), an immune checkpoint molecule important in immunity and cancer immunotherapy, as a key link between androgen and aortic aneurysms. We show that intraperitoneal injection of anti-PD-1 antibody reinstates Aldo-salt-induced aortic aneurysms in orchiectomized mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that AR binds to the PD-1 promoter to suppress its expression in the spleen. Hence, our study reveals an important but unexplored mechanism by which androgen contributes to aortic aneurysms by suppressing PD-1 expression in T cells. Our study also suggests that cancer patients predisposed to the risk factors of aortic aneurysms may be advised to screen for aortic aneurysms during immune checkpoint therapy.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=134 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/525073v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2e8406org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dde495org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c9f42eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@be2799_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Understanding how plants adapt to specific environmental changes and identifying genetic markers associated with phenotypic plasticity can help breeders develop plant varieties adapted to a rapidly changing climate. Here, we propose the use of marker effect networks as a novel method to identify markers associated with environmental adaptability. These marker effect networks are built by adapting commonly used software for building gene co-expression networks with marker effects across growth environments as the input data into the networks. To demonstrate the utility of these networks, we built networks from the marker effects of [~]10,000 non-redundant markers from 400 maize hybrids across nine environments. We demonstrate that networks can be generated using this approach, and that the markers that are co-varying are rarely in linkage disequilibrium, thus representing higher biological relevance. Multiple covarying marker modules associated with different weather factors throughout the growing season were identified within the marker effect networks. Finally, a factorial test of analysis parameters demonstrated marker effect networks are relatively robust to these options, with high overlap in modules associated with the same weather factors across analysis parameters. This novel application of network analysis provides unique insights into phenotypic plasticity, and specific environmental factors that modulate the genome.",

However, functionality of CD70-specific CARs is only modest. Here, we optimized a CD70-specific VHH based CAR (nanoCAR). We evaluated the nanoCARs in clinically relevant models in vitro, using co-cultures of CD70-specific nanoCAR T cells with malignant rhabdoid tumor organoids, and in vivo by using a diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. Whereas the nanoCAR T cells were highly efficient in organoid co-cultures, they showed only modest efficacy in the PDX model. Knocking out CD70 expression by the nanoCAR T cells resulted in dramatically enhanced functionality in the PDX model, suggesting that endogenous CD70 interaction with the nanoCAR induces exhaustion. Through single-cell transcriptomics, we obtained evidence that CD70KO CD70-specific nanoCAR T cells are protected from antigen induced exhaustion. Our data shows that CARs targeted to endogenous T cell antigens, negatively affect CAR T cell functionality by inducing an exhausted state which can be overcome by knocking out the specific target, in this case CD70.",

We identified mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) as a primary target of VDZ, with comparatively modest effects on lymphocytes.

    "abstract": "Translation is an essential attribute of all living cells. At the heart of cellular operation, it is a chemical information decoding process that begins with an input string of nucleotides and ends with the synthesis of a specific output string of peptides. The translation process is interconnected with gene expression, physiological regulation, transcription, and responses to signaling molecules, among other cellular functions. Foundational efforts have uncovered a wealth of knowledge about the mechanistic functions of and many interactions between components of translation, but the broader biochemical connections between translation, metabolism and polymer biosynthesis that enable translation to occur have not been comprehensively mapped. Here we present a multilayer graph of biochemical reactions describing the translation, polymer biosynthesis and metabolism networks of an Escherichia coli cell. Intriguingly, the compounds that compose these three layers are distinctly aggregated into three modes regardless of their layer categorization. Multimodal mass distributions are well-known in ecosystems, but this is the first such distribution reported at the biochemical level. The degree distributions of the translation and metabolic networks are each likely to be heavy-tailed, but the polymer biosynthesis network is not. A multimodal mass-degree distribution indicates that the translation and metabolism networks are each distinct, adaptive biochemical modules, and that the gaps between the modes reflect evolved responses to the functional use of metabolite, polypeptide and polynucleotide compounds. The chemical reaction network of cellular translation opens new avenues for exploring complex adaptive phenomena such as percolation and phase changes in biochemical contexts.",

    "abstract": "Three dimensional (3D) geometrical models are not only a powerful tool for quantitatively characterizing complex tissues but also useful for probing structure-function relationships in a tissue. However, these models are generally incomplete due to experimental limitations in acquiring multiple (>4) fluorescent channels simultaneously. Indeed, predictive geometrical and functional models of the liver have been restricted to few tissue and cellular components, excluding important cellular populations such as hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and Kupffer cells (KCs). Here, we performed deep-tissue immunostaining, multiphoton microscopy, deeplearning techniques, and 3D image processing to computationally expand the number of simultaneously reconstructed tissue structures. We then generated a spatio-temporal singlecell atlas of hepatic architecture (Hep3D), including all main tissue and cellular components at different stages of post-natal development in mice. We used Hep3D to quantitatively study 1) hepatic morphodynamics from early post-natal development to adulthood, and 2) the structural role of KCs in the murine liver homeostasis. In addition to a complete description of bile canaliculi and sinusoidal network remodeling, our analysis uncovered unexpected spatiotemporal patterns of non-parenchymal cells and hepatocytes differing in size, number of nuclei, and DNA content. Surprisingly, we found that the specific depletion of KCs alters the number and morphology of the HSCs. These findings reveal novel characteristics of liver heterogeneity and have important implications for both the structural organization of liver tissue and its function. Our next-gen 3D single-cell atlas is a powerful tool to understand liver tissue architecture, under both physiological and pathological conditions.",

Mutations in its components or its regulators cause genetic syndromes (known as cohesinopathies) and several types of cancer. It has been shown in a number of organisms that only a small fraction of each subunit is assembled into complexes. Therefore, the presence of an excess of soluble components hinders dynamic chromatin loading/unloading studies using fluorescent fusions in vivo.

    "abstract": "Keratins are the most diverse family of intermediate filaments and are expressed in most epithelial tissues and malignancies. They form highly stable polymers that need to be cut through during cytokinesis. Previous work suggested a role of phosphorylation, but keratin regulation during cell division is not understood in detail. Depletion of Keratin 8 in an epithelial cancer cell line (HeLa) caused chromosome segregation and cytokinesis defects. Aurora B kinase localization to midzones and cleavage furrows was reduced in Keratin 8 knockouts, suggesting that Keratin 8 helps scaffold Aurora B during cytokinesis. We mapped eleven Aurora B kinase sites in Keratin 8 that were associated with cell division. Keratin 8 S34 phosphorylation occurred specifically at the cleavage furrow and persisted at the midzone until the end of cytokinesis. Inhibition of Aurora B kinase or non-phosphorylatable Keratin 8 mutant prevented the disassembly of keratin bundles at the cleavage furrow, which blocked furrow ingression. Our data reveal a functional inter-dependency between Keratin 8 and Aurora B kinase in epithelial cells. Keratin 8 promotes the translocation of Aurora B to the midzone. Aurora B kinase then generates a local zone of Keratin phosphorylation which promotes keratin filament disassembly and allows the cleavage furrow to cut through the keratin network.",

During cytotrophoblast to syncytiotrophoblast differentiation, cells undergo regulated metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming. Mitochondria play a critical role in differentiation events in cellular systems, thus we hypothesized that mitochondrial metabolism played a central role in trophoblast differentiation. In this work, we employed static and stable isotope tracing untargeted metabolomics methods along with gene expression and histone acetylation studies in an established cell culture model of trophoblast differentiation. Trophoblast differentiation was associated with increased abundance of the TCA cycle intermediates citrate and -ketoglutarate. Citrate was preferentially exported from mitochondria in the undifferentiated state but was retained to a larger extent within mitochondria upon differentiation. Correspondingly, differentiation was associated with decreased expression of the mitochondrial citrate transporter (CIC). CRISPR/Cas9 disruption of the mitochondrial citrate carrier showed that CIC is required for biochemical differentiation of trophoblasts. Loss of CIC resulted in broad alterations in gene expression and histone acetylation. These gene expression changes were partially rescued through acetate supplementation. Taken together, these results highlight a central role for mitochondrial citrate metabolism in orchestrating histone acetylation and gene expression during trophoblast differentiation.",

Among the many sewage-associated pollutants, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are useful indicators of sewage in ecosystems and can also cause potent ecological consequences even at minute concentrations (e.g., ng/L). Despite increased study over the past three decades, PPCPs in terrestrial systems have been less studied than those in aquatic ecosystems. To evaluate PPCP prevalence and drivers in a terrestrial ecosystem, we analyzed managed and native bees collected from agroecosystems in Washington State (USA) for PPCPs. Caffeine, paraxanthine, cotinine, and acetaminophen were detected in all three evaluated taxa (Bombus vosnesenskii, Agapostemon texanus, and Apis mellifera), with B. vosnesenskii and A. texanus having a higher probability of PPCP detection relative to A. mellifera. The probability for PPCP presence in all three taxa increased in landscapes with more human development or greater plant abundance, with significant but negative interactions among these factors. These results suggest that human activity, availability of resources, and species-specific traits affect the introduction and mobilization of PPCPs in terrestrial ecosystems. Consequently, monitoring PPCPs and their ecological responses in terrestrial ecosystems creates opportunities to synthesize consequences of sewage pollution across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and organism types.",

    "abstract": "Humans are unique among mammals in having a functionally naked body with a hair-covered scalp. Scalp hair is exceptionally variable across populations within Homo sapiens. Neither the function of human scalp hair nor the consequences of variation in its morphology have been studied within an evolutionary framework. A thermoregulatory role for human scalp hair has been previously suggested. Here, we present experimental evidence on the potential evolutionary function of human scalp hair and variation in its morphology. Using a thermal manikin and human hair wigs at different wind speeds in a temperature and humidity-controlled environment, with and without simulated solar radiation, we collected data on the convective, radiative, and evaporative heat fluxes to and from the scalp in relation to properties of a range of hair morphologies, as well as a naked scalp. We find evidence for a significant reduction in solar radiation influx to the scalp in the presence of hair. Maximal evaporative heat loss potential from the scalp is reduced by the presence of hair, but the amount of sweat required on the scalp to balance the incoming solar heat (i.e. zero heat gain) is reduced in the presence of hair. Particularly, we find that hair that is more tightly curled offers increased protection against heat gain from solar radiation.\n\nSignificanceThe evolution of human scalp hair might be explained by thermoregulation pressures experienced in hot and arid environments. Bipedal posture and a hairless body may have necessitated the development of scalp hair to minimize heat gain from solar radiation, particularly in hominins with large brains. We used a thermal manikin and human-hair wigs to examine this thermoregulatory hypothesis. We found that scalp hair reduces heat gain from solar radiation; tightly curled hair is most protective. Specifically, our results show that hair protects the scalp from solar radiation while minimizing the amount of sweat required to offset heat gain, with tightly curled hair providing the most protection.",

    "abstract": "The current knowledge about how protein structures influence sequence evolution is rarely incorporated into substitution models adopted for phylogenetic inference, which are commonly based on independent with the same substitution process and ignore the known variation of the evolutionary rates across sites with different structural properties. In previous works, we presented site-specific substitution models of protein evolution based on selection on the folding stability of the native state (Stab-CPE), which predict more realistically the evolutionary variability across protein sites. However, those Stab-CPE present qualitative differences from observed data, probably because they ignore changes in the native structure, despite empirical studies suggest that conservation of the native structure is a strong selective force.\n\nHere we present novel structurally constrained substitution models (Str-CPE) based on Julian Echaves model of the structural change due to a mutation as the linear response of the protein to a perturbation and on the explicit model of the perturbation generated by a specific amino-acid mutation. Compared to our previous Stab-CPE models, the novel Str-CPE models are more stringent (they predict lower sequence entropy and substitution rate), provide higher likelihood to multiple sequence alignments (MSA) of the wild-type protein, and better predict the observed substitution rates. Next, we combine Str-CPE and Stab-CPE models to obtain structure and stability constrained substitution models (SSCPE) that fit the empirical MSAs even better. Importantly, these SSCPE models present a relevant improvement of the phylogenetic likelihood for all ten protein families that we analyzed with the program RAxML-NG.

    "abstract": "Zoosporic fungi produce unicellular motile reproductive spores with swimming tails (zoospores). These fungi are key components of aquatic food webs, acting as parasites, saprotrophs and prey, with some species representing ecologically important infectious diseases (e.g., of amphibian hosts). However, little is known about the swimming behaviour of fungal zoospores, a crucial factor governing dispersal in aquatic environments and therefore the ecological function of these fungi. Here, we track the swimming patterns of zoospores representing six species from two different phyla: Chytridiomycota and Blastocladiomycota. We report phylum-specific patterns in which Chytridiomycota species swim in a circular fashion, while Blastocladiomycota species swim in a pattern more akin to a random walk (move-stop-redirect-move). Additionally, we performed fluorescence confocal analyses of zoospores for all six species confirming they possess variant phylum-specific zoospore ultrastructures, specifically the distribution of the main cytoskeletal proteins and the number and arrangement of lipid droplet organelles within the cell. Lastly, we hypothesize a possible link between cytology, sensing of environment and swimming behaviour for these zoosporic fungi. We suggest that comparative study of these two groups will enable new understanding of the relationship between ultrastructure, cellular proteome, and how single celled eukaryotes direct flagellum-based movement.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how selective pressures drive morphological change is a central question in evolutionary biology. Feather lice have repeatedly diversified into convergent ecomorphs, based on how they escape from host defenses in different microhabitats. Here, we used nano-computed tomography scan data of 89 specimens of feather lice, belonging to four ecomorph groups to quantify variation of functional traits, including mandibular muscle volume, limb length, and three-dimensional head shape data in these tiny insects. The results suggest that the shape of the head, the proportional volume of the chewing muscles, and the length of the leg segments in feather lice are all strongly associated with specific host-habitats. Further, species that co-occur on hosts have increased rates of morphological evolution, suggesting competition for host space is one of the drivers of morphology. This supports previous work indicating that the phenotypic diversity of feather lice is the result of repeated convergence resulting from resource partitioning, microhabitat specialization, and selection pressures imposed by host defense.",

    "abstract": "Evolution in fluctuating environments is predicted to select for phenotypic plasticity or bet-hedging, depending on the accuracy of environmental cues and type of fluctuations. While these two alternatives are often contrasted in theoretical studies, their evolution are seldom studied together in empirical work.\n\nWe used experimental evolution in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis remanei to simultaneously study the evolution of plasticity and bet-hedging in environments differing only in their temperature variability. We exposed worms for 30 generations to either fast fluctuating or slowly increasing temperature, these two environments had the same average temperature over evolutionary time. After experimental evolution, we scored size at sexual maturity and fitness in full siblings reared in two different temperatures, optimal 20{degrees}C and mildly stressful 25{degrees}C.\n\nExperimental evolution in the fluctuating environment resulted in the evolution of increased body size plasticity but not increased bet-hedging, compared to evolution in the slowly changing environment. Plasticity followed the temperature size rule as size decreased with increasing temperature and this plastic response was adaptive. In addition, we discovered substantial standing genetic variation in body size, which represents a potential for further evolutionary change.",

We used a panel of 19 taxa of 18 Brassiceae species with different photosynthesis characteristics (C3 and C3-C4) with the following objectives: (i) create draft genome assemblies and annotations, (ii) quantify the level of orthology using synteny maps between all pairs of taxa, (iii) describe the phylogenetic relatedness across all the species, and (iv) track the evolution of C3-C4 intermediate photosynthesis in the Brassiceae tribe.\n\nOur results indicate that the draft de novo genome assemblies are of high quality and cover at least 90% of the gene space. Therewith we more than doubled the sampling depth of genomes of the Brassiceae tribe that comprises commercially important as well as biologically interesting species. The gene annotation generated high-quality gene models, and for most genes extensive upstream sequences are available for all taxa, yielding potential to explore variants in regulatory sequences. The genome-based phylogenetic tree of the Brassiceae contained two main clades and indicated that the C3-C4 intermediate photosynthesis has evolved five times independently. Furthermore, our study provides the first genomic support of the hypothesis that Diplotaxis muralis is a natural hybrid of D. tenuifolia and D. viminea. Altogether, the de novo genome assemblies and the annotations reported in this study are a valuable resource for research on the evolution of C3-C4 intermediate photosynthesis.",

To obviate requirements for laborious biochemical fractionation, here, we develop and apply an unprecedented two step cysteine capture method to establish the Local Cysteine Capture (Cys-LoC), and Local Cysteine Oxidation (Cys-LOx) methods, which together yield compartment-specific cysteine capture and quantitation of cysteine oxidation state. Benchmarking of the Cys-LoC method across a panel of subcellular compartments revealed more than 3,500 cysteines not previously captured by whole cell proteomic analysis. Application of the Cys-LOx method to LPS stimulated murine immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDM), revealed previously unidentified mitochondria-specific inflammation-induced cysteine oxidative modifications including those associated with oxidative phosphorylation. These findings shed light on post-translational mechanisms regulating mitochondrial function during the cellular innate immune response.",

    "abstract": "Recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) has been saving millions of lives worldwide as a potent and safe treatment for the lack of erythrocyte, which is caused by chronic kidney disease (CKD) and other issues. Several biosimilars of rhEPO have been approved since the expiry of the relevant patents to provide cost-effective options but the price of rhEPO is still high for the affordability of global community. Therefore, development of biosimilar of rhEPO at a lower price is highly necessary. Here we report the development and characterization of a biosimilar of rhEPO with high-yield satisfying regulatory requirements. The hEPO-expressing cDNA was stably expressed in CHO cells with successive transfection. The master cell bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB) were established from the best selected clone and characterized for 50 passages. The rhEPO was expressed from the WCB in single-use suspension culture system with a high-titer (1.24{+/-}0.16 g/L). To the best of our knowledge this is the highest reported rhEPO titer to date. The rhEPO was purified using a series of validated chromatography unit processes including virus inactivation and filtration. The purified EPO was formulated in serum-free buffer, sterile filtered, and analyzed as the biosimilar of reference product Eprex(R). Physicochemical analysis strongly suggested similarities between the developed rhEPO (GBPD002) and the reference. The in vitro and in vivo functional assays confirmed the similar biofunctionality of the GBPD002 and Eprex(R). GBPD002 could provide a less-expensive solution to the needful communities as an effective and safe biosimilar where rhEPO treatment is necessary.",

    "abstract": "Unintended effects of medications on diverse diseases are widespread, resulting in not only harmful drug side effects, but also beneficial drug repurposing. This implies that drugs can unexpectedly influence disease networks. Then, discovering how biological effects of drugs relate to disease biology can both provide insight into the biological basis for latent drug effects, and can help predict new effects. Rich data now comprehensively profile both drug impacts on biological processes, and known drug associations with human phenotypes. At the same time, systematic phenome-wide genetic studies have linked each common phenotype with putative disease driver genes. Here, we develop Draphnet, a supervised linear model that integrates in vitro data on 429 drugs and gene associations of nearly 200 common phenotypes to learn a network connecting these molecular signals to explain drug effects on disease. The approach uses the -omics level similarity among drugs, and among phenotypes, to extrapolate impacts of drug on disease. Our predicted drug-phenotype relationships outperform a baseline predictive model. But more importantly, by projecting each drug to the space of its influence on disease driver genes, we propose the biological mechanism of unexpected effects of drugs on disease phenotypes. We show that drugs sharing downstream predicted biological effects share known biology (i.e., gene targets), supporting the potential of our method to provide insights into the biology of unexpected drug effects on disease. Using Draphnet to map a drugs known molecular effects to their downstream effect on the disease genome, we put forward disease genes impacted by drug targets, and we suggest new grouping of drugs based on shared effects on the disease genome. Our approach has multiple applications, including predicting drug uses and learning about drug biology, with potential implications for personalized medicine.\n\nAuthor summaryMedications can impact a number of cellular processes, resulting in both their intended treatment of a health condition, and also unintended harmful or beneficial effects on other diseases. We aim to understand and predict these drug effects by learning the network connecting the biological processes altered by drugs to the genes driving disease. Our model, called Draphnet, can predict drug side effects and indications, but beyond prediction we show that it is also able to learn a drugs expected effect on the disease genome. Using Draphnet to summarize the biological impact of each drug, we put forward the disease genes impacted by drugs or drug targets. For instance, both anti-inflammatories and some PPAR-agonists share downstream effect on the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), a gene previously experimentally supported as an effector of fenofibrate. Our approach provides a biological basis for drug repurposing, potentially accelerating clinical advances.",

Unsupervised network integration methods are critical to learn informative representations for each gene, which are later used as features for downstream applications. However, these network integration methods must be scalable to account for the increasing number of networks and robust to an uneven distribution of network types within hundreds of gene networks.\n\nResultsTo address these needs, we present Gemini, a novel network integration method that uses memory-efficient high-order pooling to represent and weight each network according to its uniqueness. Gemini then mitigates the uneven distribution through mixing up existing networks to create many new networks. We find that Gemini leads to more than a 10% improvement in F1 score, 14% improvement in micro-AUPRC, and 71% improvement in macro-AURPC for protein function prediction by integrating hundreds of networks from BioGRID, and that Geminis performance significantly improves when more networks are added to the input network collection, while the comparison approachs performance deteriorates. Gemini thereby enables memory-efficient and informative network integration for large gene networks, and can be used to massively integrate and analyze networks in other domains.\n\nAvailabilityGemini can be accessed at: https://github.com/MinxZ/Gemini.\n\nContactaddiewc@cs.washington.edu, swang@cs.washington.edu",

Individual cell types have distinct roles within the embryo, so must therefore have cell-type specific gene expression and gene regulatory networks. We can better understand how the functions of different cell types are established and contribute to the embryo by determining how cell-type specific transcription begins and changes through germination. Here we describe a temporal analysis of the germinating Arabidopsis embryo at single-cell resolution. We define the highly dynamic cell-type specific patterns of gene expression and how these relate to changing cellular function as germination progresses. Underlying these are unique gene regulatory networks and transcription factor activity. We unexpectedly discover that most embryo cells transition through the same initial transcriptional state early in germination, after which cell-type specific gene expression is established. Furthermore, our analyses support previous findings that the earliest events leading to the induction of embryo growth take place in the vasculature.

Analyses of exudates with LC-MS/MS, biomass, medium pH, and nitrogen uptake showed EcoFAB 2.0s low intra-treatment data variability.

    "abstract": "BackgroundDuring domestication and subsequent improvement plants were subjected to intensive positive selection for desirable traits. Identification of selection targets is important with respect to the future targeted broadening of diversity in breeding programmes. Rye (Secale cereale L.) is a cereal that is closely related to wheat, and it is an important crop in Central, Eastern and Northern Europe. The aim of the study was (i) to identify diverse groups of rye accessions based on high-density, genome-wide analysis of genetic diversity within a set of 478 rye accessions, covering a full spectrum of diversity within the genus, from wild accession to inbred lines used in hybrid breeding, and (ii) to identify selective sweeps in the established groups of cultivated rye germplasm and putative candidate genes targeted by selection.\n\nResultsPopulation structure and genetic diversity analyses based on high-quality SNP (DArTseq) markers revealed the presence of three complexes in the Secale genus: S. sylvestre, S. strictum and S. cereale/vavilovii, a relatively narrow diversity of S. sylvestre, very high diversity of S. strictum, and signatures of strong positive selection in S. vavilovii. Within cultivated ryes we detected the presence of genetic clusters and the influence of improvement status on the clustering. Rye landraces represent a reservoir of variation for breeding, and especially a distinct group of landraces from Turkey should be of special interest as a source of untapped variation. Selective sweep detection in cultivated accessions identified 133 outlier positions within 13 sweep regions and 170 putative candidate genes related, among others, to response to various environmental stimuli (such as pathogens, drought, cold), plant fertility and reproduction (pollen sperm cell differentiation, pollen maturation, pollen tube growth),and plant growth and biomass production.\n\nConclusionsOur study provides valuable information for efficient management of rye germplasm collections, which can help to ensure proper safeguarding of their genetic potential and provides numerous novel candidate genes targeted by selection in cultivated rye for further functional characterisation and allelic diversity studies.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pulmonary bacterial infections and associated inflammation remain a cause of morbidity and mortality in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) despite new modulator therapies. Therapies targeting host factors that dampen detrimental inflammation without suppressing immune responses critical for controlling infections remain limited, while the acquisition of antibiotic resistance bacterial infections is an increasing global problem, and a significant challenge in CF. Pharmacological compounds targeting the mammalian MAPK proteins MEK1 and MEK2, referred to as MEK1/2 inhibitor compounds, have potential combined anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory effects. Here we examined the immunomodulatory properties of MEK1/2 inhibitor compounds PD0325901, trametinib, and CI-1040 on CF innate immune cells. Human CF macrophage and neutrophil phagocytic functions were assessed by quantifying phagocytosis of serum opsonized pHrodo red E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and zymosan bioparticles. MEK1/2 inhibitor compounds reduced CF macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokine production without impairing CF macrophage or neutrophil phagocytic abilities. Wild-type C57BL6/J and Cftrtm1kth (F508del homozygous) mice were used to evaluate the in vivo therapeutic potential of PD0325901 compared to vehicle treatment in an intranasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection with the community-acquired MRSA strain USA300. In both wild-type and CF mice, PD0325901 reduced infection related weight loss compared to vehicle treatment groups but did not impair clearance of bacteria in lung, liver, or spleen 1 day after infection. In summary, this study provides the first data evaluating the therapeutic potential of MEK1/2 inhibitor to modulate CF immune cells, and demonstrates that MEK1/2 inhibitors dampen pro-inflammatory responses without impairing host defense mechanisms mediating pathogen clearance.",

    "abstract": "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (N-AChRs) mediate fast synaptic signalling and are members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) family. They rely on a network of accessory proteins in vivo for correct formation and transport to the cell surface. RIC-3 is an endoplasmic reticulum protein that physically interacts with nascent pLGIC subunits and promotes their oligomerization. It is not known why some N-AChRs require RIC-3 in heterologous expression systems, while others do not. Previously we reported that the ACR-16 N-AChR from the parasitic nematode Dracunculus medinensis does not require RIC-3 in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This is unusual because all other nematode ACR-16, like the closely related Ascaris suum ACR-16, require RIC-3. Their high sequence similarity limits the number of amino acids that may be responsible, and the goal of this study was to identify them. A series of chimeras and point mutations between A. suum and D. medinensis ACR-16, followed by functional characterization with electrophysiology, identified two residues that account for a majority of the receptor requirement for RIC-3. ACR-16 with R/K159 in the cys-loop and I504 in the C-terminal tail did not require RIC-3 for functional expression. Mutating either of these to R/K159E or I504T, residues found in other nematode ACR-16, conferred a RIC-3 requirement. Our results agree with previous studies showing that these regions interact and are involved in receptor synthesis. Although it is currently unclear what precise mechanism they regulate, these residues may be critical during specific subunit folding and/or assembly cascades that RIC-3 may promote.",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of genomic stability is essential for cellular and organismal survival and fitness. Thus, when DNA gets damaged, is essential to repair it in the most accurate fashion. Among different DNA lesions, DNA double strand breaks are specially challenging. An exquisite regulatory network reacts to local and global cues to control the choice between different DNA double strand break repair mechanisms to maximize genomic integrity. Such regulation relies mostly at the level of DNA end resection, the initial steps of the homologous recombination repair pathway. On the other hand, most cellular and organismal activities follow a 24 h oscillation known as the circadian cycle. Such repetitive changes are controlled by an intrinsic, molecular clock built-in at the cellular level which core components are the heterodimers BMAL1-CLOCK and CRY-PER. These inherent rhythms control many different aspects of the cellular metabolism, including the fate of many different DNA transactions. Here we have explored the regulation of the choice between different DNA double strand break repair pathways along the circadian cycle. We observed that DNA end resection shows a circadian oscillation, with a peak at dawn followed by a progressive reduction until dusk. Such regulations depend on the cellular levels of the circadian clock core component CRY1. Consequently, repair by homologous recombination mirrors CRY1 expression levels. Such modulation is controlled through the circadian regulation of the anti-resection activity, but not the protein levels, of CCAR2, that limits CtIP-mediated resection preferentially at nightfall. Additionally, such regulation requires a crosstalk between the DNA damage-dependent phosphorylation of CRY1 by the kinase DNA-PK. Finally, such regulation has an impact in cancer progression and response to radiation therapy of specific tumors.\n\nOne sentence summaryCCAR2-dependent inhibition of DNA end resection and homologous recombination is controlled by the intrinsic cellular circadian clock",

    "abstract": "f-statistics have emerged as a first line of analysis for making inferences about demographic history from genome-wide data. These statistics can provide strong evidence for either admixture or cladality, which can be robust to substantial rates of errors or missing data. f-statistics are guaranteed to be unbiased under \"SNP ascertainment\" (analyzing non-randomly chosen subsets of single nucleotide polymorphisms) only if it relies on a population that is an outgroup for all groups analyzed. However, ascertainment on a true outgroup that is not co-analyzed with other populations is often impractical and uncommon in the literature. In this study focused on practical rather than theoretical aspects of SNP ascertainment, we show that many non-outgroup ascertainment schemes lead to false rejection of true demographic histories, as well as to failure to reject incorrect models. But the bias introduced by common ascertainments such as the 1240K panel is mostly limited to situations when more than one sub-Saharan African and/or archaic human groups (Neanderthals and Denisovans) or non-human outgroups are co-modelled, for example, f4-statistics involving one non-African group, two African groups, and one archaic group. Analyzing panels of SNPs polymorphic in archaic humans, which has been suggested as a solution for the ascertainment problem, cannot fix all these problems since for some classes of f-statistics it is not a clean outgroup ascertainment, and in other cases it demonstrates relatively low power to reject incorrect demographic models since it provides a relatively small number of variants common in anatomically modern humans. And due to the paucity of high-coverage archaic genomes, archaic individuals used for ascertainment often act as sole representatives of the respective groups in an analysis, and we show that this approach is highly problematic. By carrying out large numbers of simulations of diverse demographic histories, we find that bias in inferences based on f-statistics introduced by non-outgroup ascertainment can be minimized if the derived allele frequency spectrum in the population used for ascertainment approaches the spectrum that existed at the root of all groups being co-analyzed. Ascertaining on sites with variants common in a diverse group of African individuals provides a good approximation to such a set of SNPs, addressing the great majority of biases and also retaining high statistical power for studying population history. Such a \"pan-African\" ascertainment, although not completely problem-free, allows unbiased exploration of demographic models for the widest set of archaic and modern human populations, as compared to the other ascertainment schemes we explored.",

    "abstract": "Metazoans guard their germlines against transposons and other foreign transcripts with PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Due to the robust heritability of the silencing initiated by piRNAs in C.elegans, previous screens using Caenorhabditis elegans were strongly biased to uncover members of this pathway in the maintenance process but not in the initiation process. To identify novel piRNA pathway members, we have utilized a sensitized reporter strain which detects defects in initiation, amplification, or regulation of piRNA silencing. Using our reporter, we have identified Integrator complex subunits, nuclear pore components, protein import components, and pre-mRNA splicing factors as essential for piRNA-mediated gene silencing. We found the snRNA processing cellular machine termed the Integrator complex is required for both type I and type II piRNA production. Notably, we identified a role for nuclear pore and nucleolar components in promoting the perinuclear localization of anti-silencing CSR-1 Argonaute, as well as a role for Importin factor IMA-3 in nuclear localization of silencing Argonaute HRDE-1. Together, we have shown that piRNA silencing is dependent on evolutionarily ancient RNA processing machinery that has been co-opted to function in the piRNA mediated genome surveillance pathway.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin accessibility is a hallmark of active transcription and requires ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling by Brahma-Associated Factor (BAF). However, the mechanistic link between transcription, nucleosome remodeling, and chromatin accessibility is unclear. Here, we used a chemical-genetic approach to dissect the interplay between RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII), BAF, and DNA-sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) in mouse embryonic stem cells. By time-resolved chromatin profiling with acute transcription block at distinct stages, we show that RNAPII promoter-proximal pausing stabilizes BAF chromatin occupancy and enhances nucleosome eviction by BAF. We find that RNAPII and BAF probe both transcriptionally active and Polycomb-repressed genomic regions and provide evidence that TFs capture transient site exposure due to nucleosome unwrapping by BAF to confer locus specificity for persistent chromatin remodeling. Our study reveals the mechanistic basis of cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility. We propose a new paradigm for how functional synergy between dynamically acting chromatin factors regulates nucleosome organization.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disorder and currently affects > 500 million patients worldwide, with ~60% of them also suffering from obesity. There is no drug approved for human use that changes the course of OA progression. OA is one of the most common comorbidities of obesity, and obesity-related OA (ObOA) is a serious health concern because it shows heightened severity of tissue damage and also predominantly affects the working population. Unresolved inflammation is a major driver of ObOA, thus, resolving disease-associated inflammation is a viable strategy to treat ObOA. Resolvins are highly potent molecules that play a role in the resolution of inflammation and promote tissue healing. However, small molecules (like Resolvin D1; RvD1) have to be administered frequently or prior to injury because they lose their in vivo activity rapidly either by lymphatic clearance, or oxidation-mediated deactivation. In this study, we have encapsulated RvD1 in liposomes and established its efficacy in the mouse model of ObOA at much lower dosages than freely administered RvD1. Liposomal RvD1 (lipo-RvD1) acted as a source of the RvD1 molecules for ~11 days in vitro in synovial fluid derived from patients. When administered prophylactically or therapeutically, lipo-RvD1 suppressed cartilage damage in male C57BL/6 mice compared to untreated and free RvD1 treatments. This efficacy was achieved by increasing the proportion of the proresolution M2 macrophages over proinflammatory M1 macrophages in the synovial membrane. These results show the potential of lipo-RvD1 as an anti-OA agent.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=141 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/525015v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@141d889org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ef1753org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e463c1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15138c6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphical abstract:C_FLOATNO Mechanism of working of lipo-RvD1 in ObOA joint.\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Activated Notch signaling is highly prevalent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) but pan-Notch inhibitors were toxic in clinical trials. To find alternative ways to target Notch signals, we investigated Cell division cycle 73 (Cdc73), which is a Notch cofactor and component of transcriptional machinery, a potential target in T-ALL. While we confirmed previous work that CDC73 interacts with NOTCH1, we also found that the interaction in T-ALL was context-dependent and facilitated by the lymphoid transcription factor ETS1. Using mouse models, we showed that Cdc73 is important for Notch-induced T-cell development and T-ALL maintenance. Mechanistically, Cdc73, Ets1, and Notch intersect chromatin at promoters and enhancers to activate oncogenes and genes that are important for DNA repair and oxidative phosphorylation. Consistently, Cdc73 deletion in T-ALL cells induced DNA damage and impaired mitochondrial function. Our data suggests that Cdc73 might promote a gene expression program that was eventually intersected by Notch to mitigate the genotoxic and metabolic stresses of elevated Notch signaling. We also provide mechanistic support for testing inhibitors of DNA repair, oxidative phosphorylation, and transcriptional machinery. Inhibiting pathways like Cdc73 that intersect with Notch at chromatin might constitute a strategy to weaken Notch signals without directly targeting the Notch complex.",

    "abstract": "Animals have evolved two defense strategies to survive infections. Antagonistic strategies include mechanisms of immune resistance that operate to sense and kill invading pathogens. Cooperative or physiological defenses mediate host adaptation to the infected state, limiting physiological damage and disease, without killing the pathogen, and have been shown to cause asymptomatic carriage and transmission of lethal pathogens. Here we demonstrate that physiological defenses cooperate with the adaptive immune response to generate long-term asymptomatic carriage of the lethal enteric murine pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. Asymptomatic carriage of genetically virulent C. rodentium provided immune resistance against subsequent infections. Host immune protection was dependent on systemic antibody responses and pathogen virulence behavior, rather than the recognition of specific virulent factor antigens. Finally, we demonstrate that an avirulent strain of C. rodentium in the field has background mutations in two genes that are important for LPS structure. Our work reveals novel insight into how asymptomatic infections can arise mechanistically with immune resistance, mediating exclusion of phenotypically virulent enteric pathogen to promote asymptomatic carriage.",
