    "abstract": "Despite increasing success in determining genetic diagnosis for patients with inherited retinal diseases (IRDs), mutations in about 30% of the IRD cases remain unclear or unsettled after targeted gene panel or whole exome sequencing. In this study, we aimed to investigate the contributions of structural variants (SVs) to settling the molecular diagnosis of IRD with whole-genome sequencing (WGS). A cohort of 755 IRD patients whose pathogenic mutations remain undefined was subjected to WGS. Four SV calling algorithms including include MANTA, DELLY, LUMPY, and CNVnator were used to detect SVs throughout the genome. All SVs identified by any one of these four algorithms were included for further analysis. AnnotSV was used to annotate these SVs. SVs that overlap with known IRD-associated genes were examined with sequencing coverage, junction reads, and discordant read pairs. PCR followed by Sanger sequencing was used to further confirm the SVs and identify the breakpoints. Segregation of the candidate pathogenic alleles with the disease was performed when possible. In total, sixteen candidate pathogenic SVs were identified in sixteen families, including deletions and inversions, representing 2.1% of patients with previously unsolved IRDs. Autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked inheritance of disease-causing SVs were observed in 12 different genes. Among these, SVs in CLN3, EYS, PRPF31 were found in multiple families. Our study suggests that the contribution of SVs detected by short-read WGS is about 0.25% of our IRD patient cohort and is significantly lower than that of single nucleotide changes and small insertions and deletions.",

    "abstract": "Long interspersed element-1 (L1) retrotransposons play important roles in human disease and evolution. Their global activity is repressed by DNA methylation, but studying the regulation of individual copies has been difficult. Here, we combine short- and long-read sequencing to resolve the DNA methylation profiles of these repeated sequences in a panel of normal and cancer cells genome-wide at single-locus resolution. We unveil key principles underpinning L1 methylation heterogeneity among cell-types, families and integration sites. First, intronic L1 methylation is intimately associated with gene transcription. Conversely, L1s can influence the methylation status of the upstream region over short distances (300 bp). This phenomenon is accompanied by the binding of specific transcription factors, which drive the expression of L1 and chimeric transcripts. Finally, L1 hypomethylation alone is generally insufficient to trigger L1 expression due to redundant silencing pathways. Our results illuminate the epigenetic and transcriptional interplay between retrotransposons and their host genome.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/522582v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (52K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c78bbcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a7112dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@58abf2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@180d055_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LIBs-ATLAS-seq profiles L1 position and methylation genome-wide\nC_LIO_LIL1 has a frequent but short-range (300 bp) influence on the DNA methylation status of the upstream sequence\nC_LIO_LIHypomethylated L1s are bound by tissue-specific transcription factors which drive L1 and chimeric transcripts synthesis\nC_LIO_LIL1 hypomethylation alone is insufficient to enable its transcription at most loci\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are distinct genetic diseases of the pancreas which are defined by the abnormal level of blood glucose. Understanding the initial molecular perturbations that occur during the pathogenesis of diabetes is of critical importance in understanding these disorders. The inability to biopsy the human pancreas of living donors hampers insights into early detection, as the majority of diabetes studies have been performed on peripheral leukocytes from the blood, which is not the site of pathogenesis. Therefore, efforts have been made by various teams including the Human Pancreas Analysis Program (HPAP) to collect pancreatic tissues from deceased organ donors with different clinical phenotypes. HPAP is designed to define the molecular pathogenesis of islet dysfunction by generating detailed datasets of functional, cellular, and molecular information in pancreatic tissues of clinically well-defined organ donors with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Moreover, data generated by HPAP continously become available through a centralized database, PANC-DB, thus enabling the diabetes research community to access these multi-dimensional data prepublication. Here, we present the computational workflow for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis of 258,379 high-quality cells from the pancreatic islets of 67 human donors generated by HPAP, the largest existing scRNA-seq dataset of human pancreatic tissues. We report various computational steps including preprocessing, doublet removal, clustering and cell type annotation across single-cell RNA-seq data from islets of four distintct classes of organ donors, i.e. non-diabetic control, autoantibody positive but normoglycemic, Type 1 diabetic, and Type 2 diabetic individuals. Moreover, we present an interactive tool, called CellxGene developed by the Chan Zuckerberg initiative, to navigate these high-dimensional datasets. Our data and interactive tools provide a reliable reference for singlecell pancreatic islet biology studies, especially diabetes-related conditions.",

    "abstract": "Electron microscopy (EM) images of axons and their ensheathing myelin from both the central and peripheral nervous system are used for assessing myelin formation, degeneration (demyelination) and regeneration (remyelination). The g-ratio is the gold standard measure of assessing myelin thickness and quality, and traditionally is determined from measurements done manually from EM images - a time-consuming endeavour with limited reproducibility. These measurements have also historically neglected the innermost uncompacted myelin sheath, known as the inner myelin tongue. Nonetheless, the inner tongue has been shown to be important for myelin growth and some studies have reported that certain conditions can elicit its enlargement. Ignoring this fact may bias the standard g-ratio analysis, whereas quantifying the uncompacted myelin has the potential to provide novel insights in the myelin field. In this regard, we have developed AimSeg, a bioimage analysis tool for axon, inner tongue and myelin segmentation. Aided by machine learning classifiers trained on tissue undergoing remyelination, AimSeg can be used either as an automated workflow or as a user-assisted segmentation tool. Validation results show good performance segmenting all three fibre components, with the assisted segmentation showing the potential for further improvement with minimal user intervention. This results in a considerable reduction in time for analysis compared with manual annotation. AimSeg could also be used to build larger, high quality ground truth datasets to train novel deep learning models. Implemented in Fiji, AimSeg can use machine learning classifiers trained in ilastik. This, combined with a user-friendly interface and the ability to quantify uncompacted myelin, makes AimSeg a unique tool to assess myelin growth.\n\nAuthor SummaryMyelin is formed by specialised cells that wrap themselves around axons and has a major role in the function, protection, and maintenance of nerves. These functions are disturbed by demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. In this work we present AimSeg, a new tool based on artificial intelligence algorithms (machine learning) to assess myelin growth on electron microscopy images. Whereas standard metrics and previous computational methods focus on quantifying compact myelin, AimSeg also quantifies the inner myelin tongue (uncompacted myelin). This structure has been largely overlooked despite the fact that it has an important role in the process of myelin growth (both during development and in the adult brain) and recent studies have reported morphological changes associated with some diseases. We report the performance of AimSeg, both as a fully automated approach and in an assisted segmentation workflow that enables the user to curate the results on-the-fly while reducing human intervention to the minimum. Therefore, AimSeg stands as a novel bioimage analysis tool that meets the challenges of assessing myelin growth by supporting both standard metrics for myelin evaluation and the quantification of the uncompacted myelin in different conditions.",

    "abstract": "Light can effectively interrogate biological systems in a reversible and physiologically compatible manner with high spatiotemporal precision. Understanding the biophysics of photo-induced processes in bio-systems is crucial for achieving relevant clinical applications. Employing membranes doped with the photolipid azobenzene-phosphatidylcholine (azo-PC), we provide a holistic picture of light-triggered changes in membrane kinetics, morphology and material properties obtained from correlative studies on cell-sized vesicles, Langmuir monolayers, supported lipid bilayers and molecular dynamics simulations. Light-induced membrane area increase as high as [~]25% and a 10-fold decrease in the membrane bending rigidity is observed upon trans-to-cis azo-PC isomerization associated with membrane leaflet coupling and molecular curvature changes. Vesicle electrodeformation measurements and atomic force microscopy reveal that trans azo-PC bilayers are thicker than POPC bilayer but have higher specific membrane capacitance and dielectric constant suggesting an increased ability to store electric charges across the membrane. Lastly, incubating POPC vesicles with azo-PC solutions resulted in the insertion of azo-PC in the membrane enabling them to become photoresponsive. All these results demonstrate that light can be used to finely manipulate the shape, mechanical and electric properties of photolipid-doped minimal cell models and liposomal drug carriers, thus, presenting a promising therapeutic alternative for the repair of cellular disorders.",

    "abstract": "Loss of function screens using shRNA and CRISPR are routinely used to identify genes that modulate responses of tumor cells to anti-cancer drugs. Here, by integrating GSEA and CMAP analyses of multiple published shRNA screens, we identified a core set of pathways that affect responses to multiple drugs with diverse mechanisms of action. This suggests that these pathways represent \"weak points\" or \"Achilles heels\", whose mild disturbance should make cancer cells vulnerable to a variety of treatments. These \"weak points\" include proteasome, protein synthesis, RNA splicing, RNA synthesis, cell cycle, Akt-mTOR, and tight junction-related pathways. Therefore, inhibitors of these pathways are expected to sensitize cancer cells to a variety of drugs. This hypothesis was tested by analyzing the diversity of drugs that synergize with FDA-approved inhibitors of the proteasome, RNA synthesis, and Akt-mTOR pathways. Indeed, the quantitative evaluation indicates that inhibitors of any of these signaling pathways can synergize with a more diverse set of pharmaceuticals, compared to compounds inhibiting targets distinct from the \"weak points\" pathways. Our findings described here imply that inhibitors of the \"weak points\" pathways should be considered as primary candidates in a search for synergistic drug combinations.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients (NDMM) has shown recurrent structural variant (SV) involvement in distinct regions of the genome (i.e. hotspots) and causing recurrent copy number alterations. Together with canonical immunoglobulin translocations, these SVs are recognized as \"recurrent SVs\". More than half SVs were not involved in recurrent events. The significance of these \"rare SVs\" has not been previously examined. In this study, we utilize 752 WGS and 591 RNA-seq data from NDMM patients to determine the role of rare SVs in myeloma pathogenesis. 94% of patients harbored at least one rare SV event. Rare SVs showed an SV-class specific enrichment within genes and superenhancers associated with outlier gene expression. Furthermore, known myeloma driver genes recurrently impacted by point mutations were dysregulated by rare SVs. Overall, we demonstrate the association of rare SVs with aberrant gene expression supporting a driver role in myeloma pathogenesis.\n\nSIGNIFICANCECharacterization of multiple myeloma genome revealed that more than half structural variants are not involved in recurrent events.

These malignant cells have acquired the amazing capacity to spread from host to host. They have been described only in dogs, Tasmanian devils and marine bivalves. The Mytilus trossulus Bivalve Transmissible Neoplasia 2 (MtrBTN2) lineage has even acquired the capacity to spread inter-specifically between marine mussels of the Mytilus edulis complex worldwide. To identify the oncogenic processes underpinning the biology of these atypical cancers we performed transcriptomics of MtrBTN2 cells. Differential expression, enrichment, protein-protein interaction network, and targeted analyses were used. Overall, our results suggest the accumulation of multiple cancerous traits that way be linked to the long-term evolution of MtrBTN2. We also highlight that vertebrate and lophotrochozoan cancers could share a large panel of common drivers, which supports the hypothesis of an ancient origin of oncogenic processes in bilaterians.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how Androgen-dependent PCa cells progress to independence and modify accordingly their transcriptional repertoire is the key to preventing mCRPC progression. We recently identified a novel axis of the Hippo pathway characterized by the sequential kinase cascade induced by androgen deprivation: AR->TLK1B>NEK1>pYAP1-Y407 leading to CRPC adaptation. Phosphorylation of YAP-Y407 increases upon ADT or induction of DNA damage, correlated with the known increase in NEK1 expression/activity, and this is suppressed in the Y407F mutant. Dominant expression of YAP1-Y407F in Hek293 cells reprograms the YAP1-mediated transcriptome to reduced TEAD- and P73-regulated gene expression and mediates sensitivity to MMC. NEK1 haploinsufficient TRAMP mice display reduced YAP1 expression and if castrated fail to progress to overt prostate carcinomas, even while displaying reduced E-CAD expression in hyperplastic ductules. YAP1 overexpression, but not the Y407F mutant, transforms LNCaP cells to androgen independent growth and a mesenchymal morphology. Immunohistochemical examination of Prostate Cancer biopsies revealed that pYAP1-Y407 nuclear signal is low in samples of low-grade cancer but elevated in high GS specimens. We also found that J54, pharmacological inhibitor of the TLK1>NEK1>YAP1 nexus, leading to degradation of YAP1 can suppress the transcriptional reprogramming of LNCaP cells to Androgen-Independent growth and EMT progression even when YAP1-WT is overexpressed.",

Here, we explored the effect of EFNB1 on drug response. Analysis of IC50 data showed that high level of EFNB1 was associated with resistance to most targeted drugs targeting BCR in human DLBCL cell lines. Drug response assay showed that Efnb1 could enhance SRC phosphorylation and increased the sensitivity of cells to SRC inhibitors. Meanwhile, Efnb1 could sensitize cells to most cytotoxic drugs, especially DOX and VCR. Efnb1 could confer cells sensitivity to VCR by enhancing the phosphorylation of Stmn1 at serine 28. Survival analysis revealed that the expression level of genes phosphorylated in Efnb1 cells were associated with poor prognosis of human DLBC. Together, this study revealed that EFNB1 level, as a non-genetic mechanism, greatly affected drug response of targeted drugs and cytotoxic drugs through the phosphorylation network.

Distinct cellular transcriptional programs regulate the time-dependent tissue injury and regeneration responses.

Here, we used laser capture microdissection of formalin- fixed paraffin embedded sections followed by whole genome targeted RNA-sequencing-TempO-Seq and co-expression gene-network (module) analysis to determine the spatial-temporal responses in rat kidney glomeruli (GM), cortical proximal tubules (CPT) and outer-medulla proximal tubules (OMPT) comparison with whole kidney, after a single dose of the nephrotoxicant cisplatin. We demonstrate that cisplatin induced early onset of DNA damage in both CPT and OMPT, but not GM. Sustained DNA damage response was strongest in OMPT coinciding with OMPT specific inflammatory signaling, actin cytoskeletal remodeling and increased glycolytic metabolism coincident with suppression of mitochondrial activity. Later responses reflected regeneration-related cell cycle pathway activation and ribosomal biogenesis in the injured OMPT regions. Activation of modules containing kidney injury biomarkers was strongest in the OMPT, with OMPT Clu expression best correlating with urinary clusterin biomarker measurements compared the correlation of Kim1. Our findings also showed that whole kidney responses were less sensitive than OMPT. In conclusion, our LCM-TempO-Seq method reveals a detailed spatial mechanistic understanding of renal injury/regeneration after nephrotoxicant exposure and identifies the most representative mechanism-based nephron segment specific renal injury biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Plant genetic transformation strategies serve as essential tools for the genetic engineering and advanced molecular breeding of plants. However, the complicated operational protocol and low efficiency of the current transformation strategies restrict the genetic modification of most plant species. This paper describes the development of a Regenerative Activity-dependent in Planta Injection Delivery (RAPID) method based on the active regeneration capacity of plants. In this method, Agrobacterium tumefaciens was delivered to plant meristems via injection for inducing transfected renascent tissues. Stable transgenic plants were obtained by subsequent vegetative propagation of the positive renascent tissues. The method was successfully applied for the transformation of plants with strong regeneration capacity, including different genotypes of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), potato (Solanum tuberosum), and bayhops (I. pes-caprae). Compared to the traditional transformation methods, RAPID has a markedly high transformation efficiency (up to ~ 40%), shorter duration (less than 4 weeks), and does not require tissue culture procedures. The RAPID method therefore overcomes the limitations of traditional methods for achieving rapid in planta transformation, and can be potentially applied to a wide range of plant species that are capable of active regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, which can contain hundreds of proteins, affect human health and disease through dynamic molecular interactions with cell surface proteins. How HDL mediates its long-range signaling functions and interactions with various cell types is largely unknown. Due to the complexity of HDL, we hypothesize that multiple receptors engage with HDL particles resulting in condition-dependent receptor-HDL interaction clusters at the cell surface. Here we used the mass spectrometry-based and light-controlled proximity labeling strategy LUX-MS in a discovery-driven manner to decode HDL-receptor interactions. Surfaceome nanoscale organization analysis of hepatocytes and endothelial cells using LUX-MS revealed that the previously known HDL-binding protein scavenger receptor SCRB1 is embedded in a cell surface protein community, which we term HDL synapse. Modulating the endothelial HDL synapse, composed of 60 proteins, by silencing individual members showed that the HDL synapse can be assembled in the absence of SCRB1 and that the members are interlinked. The aminopeptidase AMPN (also known as CD13) was identified as an HDL synapse member that directly influences HDL uptake into the primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Our data indicate that preformed cell surface residing protein complexes modulate HDL function and suggest new theragnostic opportunities.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHybrids are expected to show greater phenotypic variation than their parental species, yet how hybrid phenotype expression varies with genetic distances in closely-related parental species remains surprisingly understudied. Here we study pelage and morphometric trait variation in anthropogenic hybrids between four species of Brazilian Callithrix marmosets, a relatively recent primate radiation. Marmoset species are distinguishable by pelage phenotype and level of morphological specialization for eating tree exudates. Here, we (1) describe qualitative phenotypic pelage differences between parental species and hybrids; (2) test whether significant quantitative differences exist between parental and hybrid morphometric phenotypes; and (3) determine which hybrid morphometic traits show heterosis, dysgenesis, trangression, or intermediacy relative to the parental trait. For morphometric traits, we investigated both cranial and post-cranial traits, particularly as most hybrid morphological studies focus on the former instead of the latter. Finally, we estimate mitogenomic distances between marmoset species from previously published data.\n\nResultsHybrid facial and overall body pelage variation reflected coloration and patterns seen in parental species. In morphometric traits, C. jacchus and C. penicillata were the most similar to each other, while C. aurita was the most distinct, and C. geoffroyi trait measures fell between these other species. Most traits in C. jacchus x C. penicillata hybrids showed either heterosis or were intermediate relative to the parental trait values. We observed heterosis and dygenesis in traits of C. penicillata x C. geoffroyi hybrids. Trangressive segregation was observed in hybrids of C. aurita and the other species. These hybrids were also C. aurita-like for a number of traits. Genetic distance was closest between C. jacchus and C. penicillata and farthest between C. aurita and the other species.\n\nConclusionWe attributed significant phenotypic differences between marmoset species to differences in morphological exudivory specialization in these species. Our results suggest that intermediate hybrid traits relative to the parental trait values are more likely in crosses between species with relatively lesser genetic distance. More extreme phenotypic variation is more likely in parental species with greater genetic distance, with transgressive traits appearing in hybrids of the most genetically distant parental species. We further suggest that that less developmental disturbances can be expected in hybrids of more recently diverged parental species.",

    "abstract": "During cortico-basal ganglia dependent learning, relevant environmental information is associated with certain outcomes; such learning is essential to generate adaptive behaviour in a continuously changing environment. Through repetitive trial-and-error experiences, actions are optimized and cognitive associative load can be relieved through consolidation and automatization. Although the molecular basis of learning is well studied, region-specific genome-wide expression profiles of the striatum, the major input region of cortico-basal ganglia circuits, during learning are lacking. Here we combined an automated operant conditioning paradigm with an efficient RNA-sequencing protocol to compare expression profiles among three learning stages in three striatal regions per hemisphere in a total of 240 striatal biopsies. Notably, the inclusion of matched yoked controls allowed reliably identifying learning-related expression changes. With 593 differently expressed genes (3.3% of all detected genes), we find the strongest effect of learning at an early, goal-directed stage across all three striatal region and identify a total of 921 learning-related expression changes. Our dataset provides a unique resource to study molecular markers of striatal learning.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesMapping the neurobiology of meditation using 3 Tesla functional MRI (fMRI) has burgeoned recently. However, limitations in signal quality and neuroanatomical resolution have impacted reliability and precision of extant findings. Although ultra-high strength 7 Tesla MRI overcomes these limitations, investigation of meditation using 7 Tesla fMRI is still in its infancy.\n\nMethodsIn this feasibility study, we scanned 10 individuals who were beginner meditators using 7 Tesla fMRI while they performed focused attention meditation and non-focused rest. We also measured and adjusted the fMRI signal for key physiological differences between meditation and rest. Finally, we explored the 2-week impact of the single fMRI meditation session on mindfulness, anxiety and focused attention attributes.\n\nResultsGroup-level task fMRI analyses revealed significant reductions in activity during meditation relative to rest in Default-mode network hubs, i.e., antero-medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices, precuneus, as well as visual and thalamic regions. These findings survived stringent statistical corrections for fluctuations in physiological responses which demonstrated significant differences (p < 0.05/n, Bonferroni controlled) between meditation and rest. Compared to baseline, State Mindfulness Scale (SMS) scores were significantly elevated (F = 8.16, p<0.05/n, Bonferroni controlled) following the fMRI meditation session, and were closely maintained at 2-week follow up.\n\nConclusionsThis pilot study establishes the feasibility and utility of investigating focused attention meditation using ultra-high strength (7 Tesla) fMRI, by supporting widespread evidence that focused attention meditation attenuates Default-mode activity responsible for self-referential processing. Future functional neuroimaging studies of meditation should control for physiological confounds and include behavioural assessments.",

    "abstract": "Event-related potential (ERP) sensitivity to faces is predominantly characterized by an N170 peak that has greater amplitude and shorter latency when elicited by human faces than images of other objects. We developed a computational model of visual ERP generation to study this phenomenon which consisted of a convolutional neural network (CNN) connected to a recurrent neural network (RNN). We used open-access data to develop the model, generated synthetic images for simulating experiments, then collected additional data to validate predictions of these simulations. For modeling, visual stimuli presented during ERP experiments were represented as sequences of images (time x pixels). These were provided as inputs to the model. The CNN transformed these inputs into sequences of vectors that were passed to the RNN. The ERP waveforms evoked by visual stimuli were provided to the RNN as labels for supervised learning. The whole model was trained end-to-end using data from the open-access dataset to reproduce ERP waveforms evoked by visual events. Cross-validation model outputs strongly correlated with open-access (r = 0.98) and validation study data (r = 0.78). Open-access and validation study data correlated similarly (r = 0.81). Some aspects of model behavior were consistent with neural recordings while others were not, suggesting promising albeit limited capacity for modeling the neurophysiology of face-sensitive ERP generation.",

    "abstract": "The 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a potential drug target for treating cognitive disorders, mediates communication between neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Although many competitive antagonists, agonists, and partial-agonists have been found and synthesized, they have not led to effective therapeutic treatments. In this context, small molecules acting as positive allosteric modulators binding outside the orthosteric, acetylcholine, site have attracted considerable interest. Two single-domain antibody fragments, C4 and E3, against the extracellular domain of the human 7-nAChR were generated through alpaca immunization with cells expressing a human 7-nAChR/mouse 5-HT3A chimera, and are herein described. They bind to the 7-nAChR but not to the other major nAChR subtypes, 4{beta}2 and 3{beta}4. E3 acts as a slowly associating positive allosteric modulator, strongly potentiating the acetylcholine-elicited currents, while not precluding the desensitization of the receptor. An E3-E3 bivalent construct shows similar potentiating properties but displays very slow dissociation kinetics conferring quasi-irreversible properties. Whereas, C4 does not alter the receptor function, but fully inhibits the E3-evoked potentiation, showing it is a silent allosteric modulator competing with E3 binding. Both nanobodies do not compete with -bungarotoxin, localizing at an allosteric extracellular binding site away from the orthosteric site. The functional differences of each nanobody, as well as the alteration of functional properties through nanobody modifications indicate the importance of this extracellular site. The nanobodies will be useful for pharmacological and structural investigations; moreover, they, along with the extracellular site, have a direct potential for clinical applications.",

TCVs offer better protection than Vi-PS in infants and may offer better protection in adults. Potential reasons for why TCV may be superior in adults are not fully understood. Here, we immunized wild-type (WT) mice and mice deficient in IgG or IgM with Vi-PS or TCVs (Vi conjugated to tetanus toxoid or CRM197) for up to seven months, with and without subsequent challenge with Vi-expressing Salmonella Typhimurium. Unexpectedly, IgM or IgG alone were similarly able to reduce bacterial burdens in tissues, and this was observed in response to conjugated or unconjugated Vi vaccines and was independent of antibody being of high affinity. Only in the longer-term after immunization (>5 months) were differences observed in tissue bacterial burdens of mice immunized with Vi-PS or TCV. These differences related to the maintenance of antibody responses at higher levels in mice boosted with TCV, with the rate of fall in IgG titres induced to Vi-PS being greater than for TCV. Therefore, Vi-specific IgM or IgG are independently capable of protecting from infection and any superior protection from vaccination with TCV in adults may relate to responses being able to persist better rather than from differences in the antibody isotypes induced. These findings suggest that enhancing our understanding of how responses to vaccines are maintained may inform on how to maximize protection afforded by conjugate vaccines against encapsulated pathogens such as S.

    "abstract": "A history of infection has been linked with increased risk of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and related myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Furthermore, AML and MDS patients suffer frequent infections because of disease-related impaired immunity. However, the role of infections in the development and progression of AML and MDS remains poorly understood. We and others previously demonstrated that the human nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) NM23-H1 protein promotes AML blast cell survival by inducing secretion of IL-1{beta} from accessory cells. NDPKs are an evolutionary highly conserved protein family and pathogenic bacteria secrete NDPKs that regulate virulence and host-pathogen interactions. Here, we demonstrate the presence of IgM antibodies against a broad range of pathogen NDPKs and more selective IgG antibody activity against pathogen NDPKs in the blood of AML patients and normal donors, demonstrating that in vivo exposure to NDPKs likely occurs. We also show that pathogen derived NDPK-proteins faithfully mimic the catalytically independent pro-survival activity of NM23-H1 against primary AML cells. Flow cytometry identified that pathogen and human NDPKs selectively bind to monocytes in peripheral blood. We therefore used vitamin D3 differentiated monocytes from wild type and genetically modified THP1 cells as a model to demonstrate that NDPK-mediated IL-1{beta} secretion by monocytes is NLRP3-inflammasome and caspase 1 dependent, but independent of TLR4 signaling. Monocyte stimulation by NDPKs also resulted in activation of NF-{kappa}B and IRF pathways but did not include the formation of pyroptosomes or result in pyroptotic cell death which are pivotal features of canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In the context of the growing importance of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1{beta} in AML and MDS, our findings now implicate pathogen NDPKs in the pathogenesis of these diseases.\n\nAuthor SummaryAcute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes MDS) are related blood cancers that are associated with frequent infections because the cancers suppress normal immunity. These infections are therefore generally considered as medical complications arising as a result of but separate to the cancer. However, we provide evidence here that infections may promote or drive cancer progression. We and others previously demonstrated that a human protein called NM23-H1 promotes the survival of AML cells by eliciting survival signals from other cells. NM23-H1 belongs to a highly conserved family of proteins that also occur in bacteria and fungi that cause infections in AML and MDS patients. Here we demonstrate that these bacterial and fungal proteins recapitulate the pro-survival effect of NM23-H1 on AML cells. We also determine that these effects are mediated via mechanisms already known to be important in the development and progression of AML and MDS. This study is the first to identify NM23-H1 like proteins from pathogenic microorganisms as novel activators of these pathways. These findings have important implications for how we understand infections in AML and MDS patients and suggest that in addition to being the consequence of these diseases, infections may also drive the cancer process.",

    "abstract": "Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) is a Gram-positive beneficial bacterium that resides in the human intestinal tract and belongs to the family of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). This bacterium is a widely used probiotic and was suggested to provide numerous benefits for human health. However, as in most LAB strains, the molecular mechanisms that mediate the competitiveness of probiotics under different diets remain unknown. Fermentation is a fundamental process in LAB, allowing the oxidation of simple carbohydrates (e.g., glucose, mannose) for energy production under conditions of oxygen limitation, as in the human gut. Our results indicate that fermentation reshapes the metabolome, volatilome, and proteome architecture in LGG. Furthermore, fermentation alters cell envelope remodeling and peptidoglycan biosynthesis, which leads to altered cell wall thickness, aggregation properties, and cell wall composition. In addition, fermentable sugars induced secretion of known and novel metabolites and proteins targeting the enteric pathogens Enterococcus faecalis and Salmonella Enterica serovar Typhimurium. Overall, our results link the common metabolic regulation of cell wall remodeling, aggregation to host tissues, biofilm formation in probiotic strains, and connect the production of antimicrobial effectors with metabolome reprogramming.

Although risk factors for severe illness have been identified, definitive determinants remain elusive. Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), the expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells bearing acquired somatic mutations, is associated with advanced age and hyperinflammation. Given the similar age range and hyperinflammatory phenotype between frequent CH and severe COVID-19, CH could impact the risk of severe COVID-19. Human cohort studies have attempted to prove this relationship, but conclusions are conflicting. Rhesus macaques (RMs) are being utilized to test vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19. However, RMs, even other species, have not yet been reported to develop late inflammatory COVID-19 disease. Here, RMs with either spontaneous DNMT3A or engineered TET2 CH along with similarly transplanted and conditioned controls were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and monitored until 12 days post-inoculation (dpi). Although no significant differences in clinical symptoms and blood counts were noted, an aged animal with natural DNMT3A CH died on 10 dpi. CH macaques showed evidence of sustained local inflammatory responses compared to controls. Interestingly, viral loads in respiratory tracts were higher at every timepoint in the CH group. Lung sections from euthanasia showed evidence of mild inflammation in all animals, while viral antigen was more frequently detected in the lung tissues of CH macaques even at the time of autopsy.

    "abstract": "The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is critical to viral infection of host cells which ultimately results in COVID-19. In this study we analyze the behavior of dihedral (phi and psi) angles of the spike protein over time from molecular dynamics and identify that the oscillations of these dihedral angles are dominated by a few discrete, relatively low frequencies in the 23-63 MHz range with 42.96875 MHz being the most prevalent frequency sampled by the oscillations. We further observe that upon tallying the populations of each individual frequency for all residues along the frequency spectrum, there is a regular alternation between high and low population counts along the increasing frequency values in the spectrum. This alternation of the counts becomes less pronounced and ultimately stabilizes as the frequency values increase. These observations thus suggest a regularity and propensity in the spike proteins dihedral angles to avoid similar oscillation population counts between vicinal frequencies. We also observe that for amino acids that are least abundant in the S protein, there are certain frequencies at which the dihedral angles never oscillate, in contrast to relatively abundant amino acids that ultimately cover the entire spectrum. This suggests that the frequency components of dihedral angle oscillations may also be a function of position in the primary structure: the more positions an amino acid is found in, the more frequencies it can sample. Lastly, certain residues identified in the literature as constituting the inside of a druggable pocket of the spike protein, as well as other residues identified as allosteric sites, are observed in our data to have distinctive time domain profiles. This motivates us to propose residues from our dynamic data, with similar time domain profiles, which may be of potential interest to the vaccine and drug design communities, for further investigation. Thus our findings indicate that there is a particular frequency domain profile for the spike protein, hidden within the time domain data, and this information, perhaps with the suggested residues, might provide additional insight into therapeutic development strategies for COVID-19 and beyond.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic continues with the emergence of successive new variants of concern (VOC). One strategy to prevent breakthrough infections is developing safe and effective broad-spectrum vaccines. Here, we present preclinical studies of a RBD recombinant vaccine candidate derived from the Gamma SARS-CoV-2 variant adjuvanted with alum. Gamma RBD-derived antigen elicited better neutralizing antibody and T cell responses than formulation containing ancestral RBD antigen. The Gamma-adapted subunit vaccine elicited a long-lasting antibody response with cross-neutralizing activity against different VOC including the Omicron variant. Additionally, Gamma variant RBD-adapted vaccine elicited robust T cells responses with induction of Th1 and CD8+ T cell responses in spleen and lung. Vaccine-induced immunity protected K18-hACE2 mice from intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 increasing survival, reducing body weight loss and viral burden in the lungs and brain. Importantly, the subunit vaccine demonstrated a potent effect as heterologous booster of different vaccine platforms including the non-replicating adenovirus vaccine ChAdOx1-S, the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 and the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BBIBP-CorV, increasing cross-reactive antibody responses. Our study indicates that the adjuvanted Gamma RBD vaccine is highly immunogenic and a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate to combat SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron.",

    "abstract": "Multiple variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been plaguing the world through successive waves of infection over the past three years. Studies by independent research groups across geographies have shown that the microbiome composition in COVID-19 patients (CP) differ from that of healthy individuals (CN). However, such observations were based on limited-sized sample-sets collected primarily from the early days of the pandemic. Here, we study the nasopharyngeal microbiota in COVID-19 patients, wherein the samples have been collected across the three COVID-19 waves witnessed in India, which were driven by different variants of concern. We also present the variations in microbiota of symptomatic vs asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. The nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 589 subjects providing samples for diagnostics purposes at Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CSIR-CCMB), Hyderabad, India. CP showed a marked shift in the microbial diversity and composition compared to CN, in a wave-dependent manner. Rickettsiaceae was the only family that was noted to be consistently depleted in CP samples across the waves. The genera Staphylococcus, Anhydrobacter, Thermus, and Aerococcus were observed to be highly abundant in the symptomatic CP patients when compared to the asymptomatic group. In general, we observed a decrease in the burden of opportunistic pathogens in the host microbiota during the later waves of infection. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study which was designed to understand the relation between the evolving nature of the virus and the changes in the human nasopharyngeal microbiota. Such studies not only pave way for better understanding of the disease pathophysiology but also help gather preliminary evidence on whether interventions to the host microbiota can help in better protection or faster recovery.",

    "abstract": "White matter abnormalities are an emerging feature of schizophrenia, yet the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are largely unknown. Disruption of ErbB signaling that is essential for peripheral myelination has been genetically associated with schizophrenia and white matter lesions in schizophrenic patients. However, the roles of ErbB signaling in oligodendrocytes remain elusive. Here, we used a pan-ErbB inhibition strategy and demonstrated the synergistic functions of endogenous ErbB receptors in oligodendrocytes. Through analyses of the cellular, histological, biochemical, behavioral, and electrophysiological differences in mice with manipulation of ErbB activities in oligodendrocytes at different differentiation stages, we found that ErbB signaling regulates myelination and aerobic glycolysis in oligodendrocytes, and both functions are required for working memory. ErbB inhibition in oligodendrocytes at early differentiation stages induces hypomyelination by suppressing the differentiation of newly-formed oligodendrocytes. In contrast, ErbB inhibition in mature oligodendrocytes alters neither myelination nor oligodendrocyte numbers, but accelerates axonal conduction decline under energy stress. Mechanistically, mature oligodendrocytes with ErbB inhibition reduce the expression of lactate dehydrogenase A, failing to provide lactate to electrically active axons. Supplementation of L-lactate restores axonal conduction and working memory capacity that are suppressed by ErbB inhibition in mature oligodendrocytes. These findings reveal the indispensable roles of ErbB signaling in white matter integrity and function, and provide insights into the multifaceted contributions of white matter abnormalities to cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) inhibit mRNA translation initiation by recruiting the GIGYF2/4EHP translation repressor complex to the mRNA 5 cap structure. Viruses utilise miRNAs to impair the host antiviral immune system and facilitate viral infection by expressing their own miRNAs or co-opting cellular miRNAs. We recently reported that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) encoded non-structural protein 2 (NSP2) interacts with GIGYF2. This interaction is critical for blocking translation of the Ifn1-b mRNA that encodes the cytokine Interferon-{beta}, and thereby impairs the host antiviral immune response. However, it is not known whether NSP2 also affects miRNA-mediated silencing. Here, we demonstrate the pervasive augmentation of the miRNA-mediated translational repression of cellular mRNAs by NSP2. We show that NSP2 interacts with Argonaute 2, the core component of the miRNA-Induced Silencing Complex (miRISC) and enhances the translational repression mediated by natural miRNA binding sites in the 3 UTR of cellular mRNAs. Our data reveal an additional layer of the complex mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 and likely other coronaviruses manipulate the host gene expression program through co-opting the host miRNA-mediated silencing machinery.",

    "abstract": "Patient symptom relief is often heavily influenced by the residence time of the inhibitor-target complex. For the human muscarinic receptor 3 (hMR3), tiotropium is a long-acting bronchodylator used in conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The mechanistic insights of this inhibitor remain unclear, specifically, elucidation of the main factors determining the unbinding rates could help develop the next generation of antimuscarinic agents. Using our novel unbinding algorithm, we were able to investigate ligand dissociation from hMR3. The unbinding paths of tiotropium and two of its analogues, N-methylscopolamin and homatropine methylbromide show a consistent qualitative mechanism and allowed us to identify the structural bottleneck of the process. Furthermore, our machine learning-based analysis identified key roles of the ECL2/TM5 junction involved at the transition state. Additionally, our results point at relevant changes at the intracellular end of the TM6 helix leading to the ICL3 kinase domain, highlighting the closest residue L482. This residue is located right between two main protein binding sites involved in signal transduction for hMR3s activation and regulation. We also highlight key pharmacophores of tiotropium that play determining roles in the unbinding kinetics and could aid towards drug design and lead optimization.\n\nDescription\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/522558v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2598b2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4bf425org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@89dfa8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ba9f48_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Graphical abstract of the work, showing the unbinding for ligands 1 (tiotropium, TTP), 2 (N-methylscopolamin, NMS) and 3 (homatropine methylbromide, CPD2).

However, more and more evidence indicates that the origin of life concerned the photo-chemical dissipative structuring of the fundamental molecules under UV-C light. In this paper, we analyze the Mie UV scattering properties of such a vesicle made from long chain fatty acids. We find that the vesicle could have provided early life with a shield from the faint, but dangerous, hard UV-C ionizing light (180-210 nm) that probably bathed Earths surface from before the origin of life and until perhaps 1,500 million years after, until the formation of a protective ozone layer as a result of the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Extranodal dissemination was an important feature of aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Due to the lack of available animal model, the causes of extranodal dissemination of lymphoma were largely unknown. Here, we identified a novel cell line, named MA-K, which originated from the E-Myc;Cdkn2a-/- cell line, named MA-LN in this study. Compared to MA-LN, MA-K tended to disseminate in the kidney rather than lymph nodes in lymphoma transplantation model, resembling human primary renal lymphoma. The transcriptome analysis revealed that MA-K had undergone the transcriptional evolution during the culture. Specialized transcriptional pattern analysis, we proposed in this study, identified that FOXO1-BTG1-MYD88 pattern was formed in MA-K. Further analysis found that translation pathway was the most enriched pathway in specially expressed genes (SEGs) in MA-K. Among the SEGs, 3 up-regulated genes, RPLP2, RPS16 and MRPS16, and 5 down-regulated genes, SSPN, CD52, ANKRD37, CCDC82 and VPREB3, in MA-K were identified as promising biomarkers to predict the clinical outcomes of human DLBCL. Moreover, the joint expression of the 5-gene signature could effectively predict clinical outcomes of human DLBCL in triple groups. These findings suggested that the MA-K cell line had strong clinical relevance with human aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Moreover, the MA-K primary renal lymphoma model, as a novel syngenetic mouse model, would be greatly useful for both the basic research on lymphoma dissemination and preclinical efficacy evaluation of chemotherapy and immunotherapy.",

A total of 17 students completed 10-week summer projects in plant biology. The program (PlantREU2) had a strong record of success. Over 40% of plantREU2 students co-authored a journal publication and received travel awards to attend Maize Genetics Conference. Furthermore, plantREU2 participants were significantly graduated within six years. The underrepresentation of minorities in STEM is a critical challenge. The findings of this study can be adapted similarly for underrepresented undergraduates.

Here, we examined the mechanisms that underlie macrophage-driven retinal cell death. Monocytes were extracted from patients with AMD and differentiated into macrophages (hMd{phi}s), which were characterized based on proteomics, gene expression, and ex vivo and in vivo properties. Using bioinformatics, we identified the signaling pathway involved in macrophage-driven retinal cell death, and we assessed the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway. We found that M2a hMd{phi}s were associated with retinal cell death in retinal explants and following adoptive transfer in a photic injury model. Moreover, M2a hMd{phi}s express several CCRI (C-C chemokine receptor type 1) ligands. Importantly, CCR1 was upregulated in Muller cells in models of retinal injury and aging, and CCR1 expression was correlated with retinal damage. Lastly, inhibiting CCR1 reduced photic-induced retinal damage, photoreceptor cell apoptosis, and retinal inflammation. These data suggest that hMd{phi}s, CCR1, and Muller cells work together to drive retinal and macular degeneration, suggesting that CCR1 may serve as a target for treating these sight-threatening conditions.",

However, it is not always clear to what extent each omics data type contributes to our understanding of the community dynamics and whether they are concordant with each other. Here we map the molecular response of a synthetic community of 32 human gut bacteria to three non-antibiotic drugs by using five omics layers, namely 16S rRNA gene profiling, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics. Using this controlled setting, we find that all omics methods with species resolution in their readouts are highly consistent in estimating relative species abundances across conditions. Furthermore, different omics methods complement each other in their ability to capture functional changes in response to the drug perturbations. For example, while nearly all omics data types captured that the antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine selectively inhibits Bacteroidota representatives in the community, the metatranscriptome and metaproteome suggested that the drug induces stress responses related to protein quality control and metabolomics revealed a decrease in polysaccharide uptake, likely caused by Bacteroidota depletion. Taken together, our study provides insights into how multi-omics datasets can be utilised to reveal complex molecular responses to external perturbations in microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "The Golgi apparatus is a critical intracellular organelle that is responsible for modifying, packaging, and transporting proteins to their destinations. Golgi homeostasis involving the acidic pH, ion concentration, and membrane potential, is critical for proper functions and morphology of the Golgi. Although transporters and anion channels that contribute to Golgi homeostasis have been identified, the molecular identity of cation channels remains unknown. Here we identify TMEM87A as a novel Golgi-resident cation channel that contributes to pH homeostasis and rename it as GolpHCat (Golgi pH-sensitive Cation channel). The genetic ablation of GolpHCat exhibits an impaired resting pH in the Golgi. Heterologously expressed GolpHCat displays voltage- and pH-dependent, non-selective cationic, and inwardly rectifying currents, with potent inhibition by gluconate. Furthermore, reconstitution of purified GolpHCat in liposomes generates functional channel activities with unique voltage-dependent gating and ion permeation. GolpHCat is expressed in various cell types such as neurons and astrocytes in the brain. In the hippocampus, GolpHCat-knockout mice show dilated Golgi morphology and altered glycosylation and protein trafficking, leading to impaired spatial memory with significantly reduced long-term potentiation. We elucidate that GolpHCat, by maintaining Golgi membrane potential, regulates ionic and osmotic homeostasis, protein glycosylation/trafficking, and brain functions. Our results propose a new molecular target for Golgi-related diseases and cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Camellia nitidissima is a prized woody flower with golden-yellow flowers, and has high ornamental, medicinal and economic value. Previous works indicated that the content of flavonol accumulated greatly during golden petal formation. However, the molecular mechanism of golden flower formation in C. nitidissima remains largely unknown. In this study, we performed an integrative anlysis of transcriptome, proteome and metablome of petals at five developmental stages to construct the regulatory network during golden flower formation in C. nitidissima. Metablome anlysis showed that two flavonols, the quercetin and kaempferol glycosides, were highly accumulated in the golden petals. Furthermore, transcriptome and proteome sequencing suggested that the expression of flavonol biosynthesis genes or proteins was increased in golden petal stage, whereas expression of anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin genes or proteins were decreased. Six MYB and 20 bHLH genes were identified as potentially involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, and the brassinosteroid (BR) and jasmonate (JA) pathways were positively and negatively corretated with flavonol biosynthesis, respectively. Network correlation analysis suggested close relationships among BR and JA, MYB and bHLH, and the flavonoid pathway and flavonoid metabolites. Overall, this study shows a potential regulatory mechanism of flavonol biosynthesis duing golden petal formation in C. nitidissima.\n\nHighlightThe BR and JA pathway may positively and negatively regulate flavonol synthesis in Camellia nitidissima, respectively.",

Although stem cell specific biological networks of transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers are well established, how the ES cell specific transcriptional and alternative splicing (AS) machinery regulate their expression has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we show that the lncRNA associated protein TOBF1 regulates the co-transcriptional alternative splicing of transcripts necessary for maintaining stem cell identity in mouse ES cells.

Do microbial taxa covary in abundance over millions of years? Multivariate phylogenetic models of trait evolution are key to answering similar questions for complex host phenotypes, yet they are not directly applicable to relative abundances, which usually characterize microbiota. Here, we extend these models in this context, thereby providing a powerful approach for estimating phylosymbiosis (the extent to which closely related host species harbor similar microbiota), ancestral microbiota composition, and integration (evolutionary covariations in bacterial abundances). We apply our model to the gut microbiota of mammals and birds. We find significant phylosymbiosis that is not entirely explained by diet and geographic location, indicating that other evolutionary-conserved traits shape microbiota composition. We identify main shifts in microbiota composition during the evolution of the two groups and infer an ancestral mammalian microbiota consistent with an insectivorous diet. We also find remarkably consistent evolutionary covariations among bacterial orders in mammals and birds. Surprisingly, despite the substantial variability of present-day gut microbiota, some aspects of their composition are conserved over millions of years of host evolutionary history.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe etiology of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is unclear but involves both genetics and environmental factors, including the gut microbiota. Indeed, exacerbated activation of the gastrointestinal immune system toward the gut microbiota occurs in genetically susceptible hosts and under the influence of the environment. For instance, a majority of IBD susceptibility loci lie within genes involved in immune responses, such as caspase recruitment domain member 9 (Card9). However, the relative impacts of genotype versus microbiota on colitis susceptibility in the context of CARD9 deficiency remain unknown.\n\nResultsCard9 gene directly contributes to recovery from dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis by inducing the colonic expression of the cytokine IL-22 and the antimicrobial peptides Reg3{beta} and Reg3{gamma} independently of the microbiota. On the other hand, Card9 is required for regulating the microbiota capacity to produce AhR ligands, which leads to the production of IL-22 in the colon, promoting recovery after colitis. In addition, cross-fostering experiments showed that five weeks after weaning, the microbiota transmitted from the nursing mother before weaning had a stronger impact on the tryptophan metabolism of the pups than the pups own genotype.\n\nConclusionsThese results show the role of CARD9 and its effector IL-22 in mediating recovery from DSS-induced colitis in both microbiota-independent and microbiota-dependent manners. Card9 genotype modulates the microbiota metabolic capacity to produce AhR ligands, but this effect can be overridden by the implantation of a WT or \"healthy\" microbiota before weaning. It highlights the importance of the weaning reaction occurring between the immune system and microbiota for host metabolism and immune functions throughout life. A better understanding of the impact of genetics on microbiota metabolism is key to developing efficient therapeutic strategies for patients suffering from complex inflammatory disorders.",

    "abstract": "Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of catecholamines. Substrates of the enzyme include neurotransmitters such as dopamine and epinephrine, and therefore, COMT plays a central role in neurobiology. Since COMT also metabolises catecholamine drugs such as L-DOPA, variation in COMT activity could affect pharmacokinetics and drug availability. Certain COMT missense variants have been shown to display decreased enzymatic activity. Additionally, studies have shown that such missense variants may lead to loss-of-function induced by impaired structural stability, which results in activation of the protein quality control system and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Here, we demonstrate that two rare missense variants of COMT are ubiquitylated and targeted for proteasomal degradation as a result of structural destabilisation and misfolding. This results in strongly reduced intracellular steady-state levels of the enzyme, which for the L135P variant is rescued upon binding to the COMT inhibitors entacapone and tolcapone. Our results reveal that the degradation is independent of the COMT isoform, as both soluble (S-COMT) and ER membrane-bound (MB-COMT) variants are degraded. In silico structural stability predictions identify regions within the protein that are critical for stability overlapping with evolutionarily conserved residues, pointing towards other variants that are likely destabilised and degraded.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA severe threat to human health is septic cardiomyopathy (SCM), a condition with high morbidity and fatality rates throughout the world. However, effective treatment targets are still lacking. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to find new therapeutic targets of SCM.\n\nMethodsWe obtained gene chip datasets GSE79962, GSE53007 and GSE13205 from the GEO database. After data normalization, GSE79962 was used as the training set and screened for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Then, the module genes most related to SCM were identified via weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The potential target genes of SCM were obtained by intersection of DEGs and WGCNA module genes. We further performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) function and pathway enrichment analyses on these genes. In addition, potential biomarkers were screened using machine learning algorithms and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was then used to explore the mechanisms underlying the involvement of potential biomarkers. Finally, we validated the obtained potential biomarkers in test sets (GSE53007 and GSE13205).\n\nResultsA total of 879 DEGs were obtained by differential expression analysis. WGCNA generated 2939 module genes significantly associated with SCM. The intersection of the two results produced 479 potential target genes. Enrichment analysis showed that these genes were involved in the positive regulation of protein kinase A signaling, histone deacetylase activity and T cell receptor signaling pathway, etc. Then, the results of machine learning algorithm and ROC analysis revealed that NEIL3, APEX1, KCNJ14 and TKTL1 had good diagnostic efficacy. GSEA results showed that these genes involved in signaling pathways mainly enriched in base excision repair and glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis pathways, etc. Notably, APEX1 was significantly up-regulated in the SCM groups of the two test sets and the AUC (area under curve) > 0.85.\n\nConclusionsOur study identified NEIL3, APEX1, KCNJ14 and TKTL1 may play important roles in the pathogenesis of SCM through integrated bioinformatics analysis, and APEX1 may be a novel biomarker with great potential in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of SCM in the future.",

    "abstract": "TMEM87 family is evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic transmembrane proteins residing in the Golgi1. TMEM87 members play a role in retrograde transport in Golgi and are also proposed mechanosensitive ion channel implicated in cancer and heart disease2-7. In an accompanying study, TMEM87A is described as a voltage-gated, pH-sensitive, non-selective cation channel whose genetic ablation in mice disrupts Golgi morphology, alters glycosylation and protein trafficking, and impairs hippocampal memory. Despite the pivotal functions of TMEM87s in Golgi, underlying molecular mechanisms of channel gating and ion conduction have remained unknown. Here, we present a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of human TMEM87A (hTMEM87A). Compared with typical ion channels, the architecture of hTMEM87A is unique: a monomeric cation channel consisting of a globular extracellular/luminal domain and a seven-transmembrane domain (TMD) with close structural homology to channelrhodopsin. The central cavity within TMD is occupied by endogenous phosphatidylethanolamine, which seals a lateral gap between two TMs exposed to the lipid bilayer. By combining electrophysiology and molecular dynamics analysis, we identify a funnel-shaped electro-negative luminal vestibule that effectively attracts cations, and phosphatidylethanolamine occludes ion conduction. Our findings suggest that a conformational switch of highly conserved positively-charged residues on TM3 and displacement of phosphatidylethanolamine are opening mechanisms for hTMEM87A, providing an unprecedented insight into the molecular basis for voltage-gated ion conduction in Golgi.",

    "abstract": "The narrow escape theory (NET) predicts the escape time distribution of Brownian particles confined to a domain with reflecting borders except for one small window. Applications include molecular activation events in cell biology and biophysics. Specifically, the mean first passage time [Formula] can be analytically calculated from the size of the domain, the escape window, and the diffusion coefficient of the particles. In this study, we systematically tested the NET in a disc by variation of the escape opening. Our model system consisted of micro-patterned lipid bilayers. For the measurement of [Formula], we imaged diffusing fluorescently-labeled lipids using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. We overcame the lifetime limitation of fluorescent probes by re-scaling the measured time with the fraction of escaped particles. Experiments were complemented by matching stochastic numerical simulations. To conclude, we confirmed the NET prediction in vitro and in silico for the disc geometry in the limit of small escape openings.\n\nSignificance StatementIn the biological context of a cell, a multitude of reactions are facilitated by diffusion. It is astonishing how Brownian motion as a cost-efficient but random process is mediating especially fast reactions. The formalism of the narrow escape theory is a tool to determine the average timescale of such processes to be completed (mean first passage time, MFPT) from the reaction space and diffusion coefficient. We present the systematic proof of this formalism experimentally in a bio-mimetic model system and by random walk simulations. Further, we demonstrate a straightforward solution to determine the MFPT from incomplete experimental traces. This will be beneficial for measurements of the MFPT, reliant on fluorescent probes, that have prior been inaccessible.",

Here, by using a novel reporter mouse strain expressing SATB1-Venus and genome editing, we have identified a cis-regulatory enhancer, essential for maintaining Satb1 expression specifically in TH2 cells. This enhancer is occupied by STAT6 and interacts with Satb1 promoters through chromatin looping in TH2 cells. Reduction of Satb1 expression, by the lack of this enhancer, resulted in elevated IL-5 expression in TH2 cells. In addition, we found that Satb1 is induced in activated group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) through this enhancer.

    "abstract": "Development of effective vaccines for infectious diseases has been one of the most successful global health interventions in history. Though, while ideal subunit vaccines strongly rely on antigen and adjuvant(s) selection, the mode and timescale of exposure to the immune system has often been overlooked. Unfortunately, poor control over the delivery of many adjuvants, which play a key role in enhancing the quality and potency of immune responses, can limit their efficacy and cause off-target toxicities. There is critical need for new adjuvant delivery technologies to enhance their efficacy and boost vaccine performance. Nanoparticles (NPs) have been shown to be ideal carriers for improving antigen delivery due to their shape and size, which mimic viral structures, but have been generally less explored for adjuvant delivery. Here, we describe the design of self-assembled poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactic acid) nanoparticles decorated with CpG, a potent TLR9 agonist, to increase adjuvanticity in COVID-19 vaccines. By controlling the surface density of CpG, we show that intermediate valency is a key factor for TLR9 activation of immune cells. When delivered with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, CpG NP adjuvants greatly improve the magnitude and duration of antibody responses when compared to free CpG, and result in overall greater breadth of immunity against variants of concern. Moreover, encapsulation of CpG NPs into injectable polymeric-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogels enhance the spatiotemporal control over co-delivery of CpG NP adjuvant and spike protein antigen such that a single immunization of hydrogel-based vaccines generates comparable humoral responses as a typical prime-boost regimen of soluble vaccines. These delivery technologies can potentially reduce the costs and burden of clinical vaccination, both of which are key elements in fighting a pandemic.",

The fact that XBB.1 and XBB.1.5 showed comparable antibody evasion but distinct transmissibility suggests enhanced receptor-binding affinity would indeed lead to higher growth advantages. The strong hACE2 binding of XBB.1.5 could also enable its tolerance of further immune escape mutations, which should be closely monitored.",

    "abstract": "Coordinated cell movement is a fundamental process in organ formation. During heart development, bilateral myocardial precursors collectively move towards the midline (cardiac fusion) to form the primitive heart tube. Along with extrinsic influences such as the adjacent anterior endoderm which are known to be required for cardiac fusion, we previously showed that the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra) is also required. However, an intrinsic mechanism that regulates myocardial movement remains to be elucidated. Here, we uncover an essential intrinsic role in the myocardium for the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) intracellular signaling pathway in directing myocardial movement towards the midline. In vivo imaging reveals that in PI3K-inhibited zebrafish embryos myocardial movements are misdirected and slower, while midline-oriented dynamic myocardial membrane protrusions become unpolarized. Moreover, PI3K activity is dependent on and genetically interacts with Pdgfra to regulate myocardial movement. Together our findings reveal an intrinsic myocardial steering mechanism that responds to extrinsic cues during the initiation of cardiac development.",

    "abstract": "Despite mounting evidence on the ecological impacts of damming for biodiversity, little is known regarding its consequences in the hyper-diverse Southeast Asian tropical forests. Here we assess the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on the diversity and activity of insectivorous bats within the hydroelectric Kenyir Lake in peninsular Malaysia. We surveyed bat assemblages on 26 islands and two mainland continuous forest sites using passive acoustic monitoring. Echolocation calls were classified into sonotypes, each corresponding to either one or multiple species, and grouped into foraging guilds. We then examined bat overall assemblage (sonotype richness, activity, and composition), guild- and sonotype-specific activity. From 9360 hours of recordings, we identified 16 bat sonotypes, including 10 forest (2854 bat passes), three edge (13 703) and three open-space foragers (3651). Sonotype richness increased towards denser forest structures (higher Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI), while species composition varied across the gradient of forest area. Forest foragers were positively affected by NDVI and negatively affected by distance to the closest neighbour, whereas edge foragers activity increased in smaller islands. Of the six sonotypes analysed, the activity of one forest sonotype increased with forest area, while that of one edge sonotype decreased. Ensuring habitat quality within insular forest remnants, in addition to their functional connectivity, maximises bat diversity, including the persistence of forest foraging species. Future hydropower development should therefore avoid the creation of a myriad of small, isolated, and habitat-degraded islands further characterised by altered levels of bat diversity and guild-level activity.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe assessed the diversity of insectivorous bats in dam-induced islands in Malaysia\nC_LIO_LISpecies persistence was modulated by island size and habitat quality\nC_LIO_LIForest foragers were negatively affected by island isolation and degradation\nC_LIO_LIEdge foragers benefited from fragmentation, increasing in activity on smaller islands\nC_LIO_LIBy creating multiple small, isolated, degraded islands, damming erodes bat diversity\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The \"paradox of sex\" refers to the question of why sexual reproduction is maintained in the wild, despite how costly it is compared to asexual reproduction. Because of these costs, one would suspect nature would select for asexual reproduction, yet sex seems to be continually selected for. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain this incongruence, including the niche differentiation hypothesis, the Red Queen hypothesis, and accumulation of harmful mutations in asexual species due to inefficient purifying selection. This study focuses on the accumulation of mutations in the closely related terrestrial isopod species Trichoniscus pusillus, which has sexual diploid and parthenogenic triploid forms, and Hyloniscus riparius, an obligately sexual relative. We surveyed sex ratios of both species in an upstate New York population and obtained RNA-seq data from wild-caught individuals of both species to examine within- and between-species patterns of molecular evolution in protein-coding genes. The sex ratio and RNA-seq data together provide strong evidence that this T. pusillus population is entirely asexual and triploid, while the H. riparius population is sexual and diploid. Although all wild-caught T. pusillus individuals used for sequencing shared identical genotypes at nearly all SNPs, supporting a clonal origin for this population, heterozygosity and SNP density were much higher in T. pusillus than in the sexually reproducing H. riparius, suggesting this parthenogenic lineage may have arisen via mating between two divergent diploid lineages. Between-species sequence comparisons showed no evidence of ineffective purifying selection in the asexual T. pusillus lineage, as measured by the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS ratios). Likewise, there was no difference between T. pusillus and H. riparius in the ratios of nonsynonyous to synonymous SNPs overall (pN/pS). However, pN/pS ratios in T. pusillus were significantly higher when considering only SNPs that may have arisen via recent mutation after the transition to parthenogenesis. Thus, these recent SNPs support the hypothesis that purifying selection is less effective against new mutations in asexual lineages, but that this only becomes apparent over long time scales. This system provides a useful model for future studies on the evolutionary tradeoffs between sexual and asexual reproduction in nature.\n\nSignificanceAsexual organisms are expected to have several key evolutionary advantages, most multicellular organisms reproduce sexually. One hypothesis to explain why sex is so common despite its costs proposes that recombination allows selection to remove harmful mutations from sexual populations more efficiently. We tested this hypothesis by looking at sequence variants in expressed genes in a novel study system, an asexual terrestrial isopod crustacean and a close sexual relative. Our results support the hypothesis that selection is less effective at filtering out harmful mutations in asexual organisms, but that longer time scales may be needed for this cost of asexual reproduction to become substantial.",

    "abstract": "The genomic substitution rate (GSR) of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a molecular clock feature and does not change under fluctuating environmental factors such as the infected human population (100-107), vaccination etc.. The molecular clock feature is believed to be inconsistent with the selectionist theory (ST). The GSR shows lack of dependence on the effective population size, suggesting Ohtas nearly neutral theory (ONNT) is not applicable to this virus. Big variation of the substitution rate within its genome is also inconsistent with Kimuras neutral theory (KNT). Thus, all three existing evolution theories fail to explain the evolutionary nature of this virus. In this paper, we proposed a Segment Substitution Rate Model (SSRM) under non-neutral selections and pointed out that a balanced mechanism between negative and positive selection of some segments that could also lead to the molecular clock feature. We named this hybrid mechanism as near-neutral balanced selection theory (NNBST) and examined if it was followed by SARS-CoV-2 using the three independent sets of SARS-CoV-2 genomes selected by the Nextstrain team. Intriguingly, the relative substitution rate of this virus exhibited an L-shaped probability distribution consisting with NNBST rather than Poisson distribution predicted by KNT or an asymmetric distribution predicted by ONNT in which nearly neutral sites are believed to be slightly deleterious only, or the distribution that is lack of nearly neutral sites predicted by ST. The time-dependence of the substitution rates for some segments and their correlation with the vaccination were observed, supporting NNBST. Our relative substitution rate method provides a tool to resolve the long standing \"neutralist-selectionist\" controversy. Implications of NNBST in resolving Lewontins Paradox is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "The human skeletal form underlies our ability to walk on two legs, but unlike standing height, the genetic basis of limb lengths and skeletal proportions is less well understood. Here we applied a deep learning model to 31,221 whole body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) images from the UK Biobank (UKB) to extract 23 different image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) that include all long bone lengths as well as hip and shoulder width, which we analyzed while controlling for height. All skeletal proportions are highly heritable ([~]40-50%), and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these traits identified 179 independent loci, of which 102 loci were not associated with height. These loci are enriched in genes regulating skeletal development as well as associated with rare human skeletal diseases and abnormal mouse skeletal phenotypes. Genetic correlation and genomic structural equation modeling indicated that limb proportions exhibited strong genetic sharing but were genetically independent of width and torso proportions. Phenotypic and polygenic risk score analyses identified specific associations between osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and knee, the leading causes of adult disability in the United States, and skeletal proportions of the corresponding regions. We also found genomic evidence of evolutionary change in arm-to-leg and hip-width proportions in humans consistent with striking anatomical changes in these skeletal proportions in the hominin fossil record. In contrast to cardiovascular, auto-immune, metabolic, and other categories of traits, loci associated with these skeletal proportions are significantly enriched in human accelerated regions (HARs), and regulatory elements of genes differentially expressed through development between humans and the great apes. Taken together, our work validates the use of deep learning models on DXA images to identify novel and specific genetic variants affecting the human skeletal form and ties a major evolutionary facet of human anatomical change to pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Consistent gene annotation in crops is becoming harder as genomes for new cultivars are frequently published. Gene sets from recently sequenced accessions have different gene identifiers to those on the reference accession, and might be of higher quality due to technical advances. For these reasons there is a need to define pangenes, which represent all known syntenic orthologues for a gene model and can be linked back to the original annotation sources. A pangene set effectively summarizes our current understanding of the coding potential of a crop and can be used to inform gene model annotation in new cultivars. Here we present an approach (get_pangenes) to identify and analyze pangenes that is not biased towards the reference annotation. The method involves computing Whole Genome Alignments (WGA), which are used to estimate gene model overlaps. After a benchmark on Arabidopsis, rice, wheat and barley datasets, we find that minimap2 performs better than the GSAlign WGA algorithm. Our results show that pangenes recapitulate known phylogeny-based orthologies while adding extra core gene models in rice. More importantly, get_pangenes can also produce clusters of genome segments (gDNA) that overlap with gene models annotated in other cultivars. By lifting-over CDS sequences, gDNA clusters can help refine gene models across individuals and confirm or reject observed gene Presence-Absence Variation. A collection of flowering-related genes from the barley pangenome are discussed in detail. Documentation and source code are available at https://github.com/Ensembl/plant-scripts.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor Shavenbaby (Svb), the only member of the OvoL family in Drosophila, controls intestinal stem cell differentiation. Post-translational modification of Svb produces two protein isoforms, Svb-ACT and Svb-REP, which promote intestinal stem cell renewal or differentiation, respectively. Using engineered cell lines, we express either isoform to define their mode of action, and develop an unbiased method to identify Svb target genes in intestinal cells. Within a given cell type, Svb-ACT and Svb-REP antagonistically regulate the expression of a set of target genes, binding specific enhancers whose accessibility is constrained by. During intestinal differentiation, the set of target genes progressively changes, together with chromatin accessibility. Moreover, Svb-REP binding stabilizes three-dimensional enhancer-promoter loops, while influencing the local chromatin landscape to repress target genes. We propose that SvbACT-to-REP switch promotes enterocyte differentiation of intestinal stem cells through direct gene regulation and chromatin remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Atypical PKCs are cell polarity kinases that operate at the plasma membrane where they function within multiple molecular complexes to contribute to the establishment and maintenance of polarity. In contrast to the classical and novel PKCs, atypical PKCs do not respond to diacylglycerol cues to bind the membrane compartment. Until recently it was not clear how aPKCs are recruited; whether aPKCs can directly interact with membranes or whether they are dependent on other protein interactors to do so. Two recent studies identified the pseudo-substrate region and the C1 domain as direct membrane interaction modules, however their relative importance and coupling are unknown. We combined molecular modelling and functional assays to show that the regulatory module of aPKC{iota}, comprising the PB1 pseudo-substrate and C1 domains, forms a cooperative and spatially continuous invariant membrane interaction platform. Furthermore, we show the coordinated orientation of membrane-binding elements within the regulatory module requires a key PB1-C1 interfacial {beta}-strand (BSL). We show this element contains a highly conserved Tyr residue that can be phosphorylated and that negatively regulates the integrity of the regulatory module, leading to membrane release. We thus expose a novel regulatory mechanism of aPKC{iota} membrane binding and release during cell polarization.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge for any mass spectrometry-based proteomics experiment is the identification of the peptide that generated each acquired tandem mass spectrum. Although approaches that leverage known peptide sequence databases are widely used and effective for well-characterized model organisms, such methods cannot detect unexpected peptides and can be impractical or impossible to apply in some settings. Thus, the ability to assign peptide sequences to the acquired tandem mass spectra without prior information--de novo peptide sequencing--is valuable for gaining biological insights for tasks including antibody sequencing, immunopeptidomics, and metaproteomics. Although many methods have been developed to address this de novo sequencing problem, it remains an outstanding challenge, in part due to the difficulty of modeling the irregular data structure of tandem mass spectra. Here, we describe Casanovo, a machine learning model that uses a transformer neural network architecture to translate the sequence of peaks in a tandem mass spectrum into the sequence of amino acids that comprise the generating peptide. We train a Casanovo model from 30 million labeled spectra and demonstrate that the model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on a cross-species benchmark dataset. We also develop a version of Casanovo that is fine-tuned for non-enzymatic peptides. Finally, we demonstrate that Casanovos superior performance improves the analysis of immunopeptideomics and metaproteomics experiments and allows us to delve deeper into the dark proteome.",

Three OCT4s bind the pre-positioned nucleosome by recognizing non-canonical DNA motifs. Two use their POUS domains by forming extensive hydrogen bonds. The other uses the POUS-loop-POUHD region; POUHD serves as a wedge to unwrap [~]25 base pair DNA. Biochemical studies suggest that multiple OCT4s cooperatively open the H1-condensed nucleosome array containing the LIN28B nucleosome.

    "abstract": "As an essential post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression, microRNA (miR) levels must be strictly maintained. The biogenesis of many, but not all, miRs is mediated by trans-acting protein partners through a variety of mechanisms, including remodeling of the RNA structure. miR-31 functions as an oncogene in numerous cancers and interestingly, its biogenesis is not known to be regulated by protein binding partners. Therefore, the intrinsic structural properties of pre-miR-31 can provide a mechanism by which its biogenesis is regulated. We determined the solution structure of the precursor element of miR-31 (pre-miR-31) to investigate the role of distinct structural elements in regulating Dicer processing. We found that the presence or absence of mismatches within the helical stem do not strongly influence Dicer processing of the pre-miR. However, both the apical loop size and structure at the Dicing site are key elements for discrimination by Dicer. Interestingly, our NMR-derived structure reveals the presence of a triplet of base pairs that link the Dicer cleavage site and the apical loop. Mutational analysis in this region suggests that the stability of the junction region strongly influence both Dicer binding and processing. Our results enrich our understanding of the active role that RNA structure plays in regulating Dicer processing which has direct implications for control of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The molecular circadian clock, which controls rhythmic 24-hour oscillation of genes, proteins, and metabolites in healthy tissues, is disrupted across many human cancers. Deregulated expression of the MYC oncoprotein has been shown to alter expression of molecular clock genes, leading to a disruption of molecular clock oscillation across cancer types. It remains unclear what benefit cancer cells gain from suppressing clock oscillation, and how this loss of molecular clock oscillation impacts global gene expression and metabolism in cancer. We hypothesized that MYC or its paralog N-MYC (collectively termed MYC herein) suppress oscillation of gene expression and metabolism to upregulate pathways involved in biosynthesis in a static, non-oscillatory fashion. To test this, cells from distinct cancer types with inducible MYC were examined, using time-series RNA-sequencing and metabolomics, to determine the extent to which MYC activation disrupts global oscillation of genes, gene expression pathways, and metabolites. We focused our analyses on genes, pathways, and metabolites that changed in common across multiple cancer cell line models. We report here that MYC disrupted over 85% of oscillating genes, while instead promoting enhanced ribosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis and suppressed cell attachment pathways. Notably, when MYC is activated, biosynthetic programs that were formerly circadian flipped to being upregulated in an oscillation-free manner. Further, activation of MYC ablates the oscillation of nutrient transporter proteins while greatly upregulating transporter expression, cell surface localization, and intracellular amino acid pools. Finally, we report that MYC disrupts metabolite oscillations and the temporal segregation of amino acid metabolism from nucleotide metabolism. Our results demonstrate that MYC disruption of the molecular circadian clock releases metabolic and biosynthetic processes from circadian control, which may provide a distinct advantage to cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis is a multistep process that leads to the formation of clinically detectable tumor foci at distant organs and frequently patient demise. Only a subpopulation of breast cancer cells within the primary tumor can disseminate systemically and cause metastasis. To disseminate, cancer cells must express MenaINV, an isoform of the actin-regulatory protein Mena encoded by the ENAH gene that endows tumor cells with transendothelial migration activity allowing them to enter and exit the blood circulation. We have previously demonstrated that MenaINV mRNA and protein expression is induced in cancer cells by macrophage contact. In this study, we discovered the precise mechanism by which macrophages induce MenaINV expression in tumor cells. We examined the promoter of the human and mouse ENAH gene and discovered a conserved NF-{kappa}B transcription factor binding site. Using live imaging of an NF-{kappa}B activity reporter and staining of fixed tissues from mouse and human breast cancer we further determined that for maximal induction of MenaINV in cancer cell NF-{kappa}B needs to cooperate with the Notch1 signaling pathway. Mechanistically, Notch1 signaling does not directly increase MenaINV expression, but it enhances and sustains NF-{kappa}B signaling through retention of p65, an NF-{kappa}B transcription factor, in the nucleus of tumor cells, leading to increased MenaINV expression. In mice, these signals are augmented following chemotherapy treatment and abrogated upon macrophage depletion. Targeting Notch1 signaling in vivo decreased NF-{kappa}B signaling and MenaINV expression in the primary tumor and decreased metastasis. Altogether, these data uncover mechanistic targets for blocking MenaINV induction that should be explored clinically to decrease cancer cell dissemination and improve survival of patients with metastatic disease.",

    "abstract": "GATA3 is somatically mutated in approximately 15% of estrogen receptor positive human breast tumors, however the mechanism(s) by which these alterations contribute to tumorigenesis are unclear. The observed patterns of mutations suggest a strong selective pressure to mutate a single allele of GATA3 in a manner favoring retention of the first of two zinc finger domains. The non-mutated GATA3 allele is maintained and expressed. We and others have hypothesized that expression of the mutant GATA3 protein may actively contribute to breast tumorigenesis, however the aging of several independently generated mouse models with mammary-specific mutant GATA3 expression did not result in tumorigenesis. In this study, we evaluated whether a mammary tumor-promoting dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate could synergize with mammary specific mutant GATA3 (G335fs) expression and accelerate the kinetics of tumor formation. We report that the tumor incidence rate in these animals did not differ from that observed in wild-type littermate controls.",

    "abstract": "In the fibrotic kidneys, the extent of a formed deleterious microenvironment is determined by cellular mechanical forces. This process requires metabolism for energy; however, how cellular mechanics and metabolism are connected remains unclear. Our proteomics revealed that actin filament binding and cell metabolism are the two most dysregulated events in the fibrotic kidneys. As a prominent actin stabilizer, Calponin 2 (CNN2) is predominantly expressed in fibroblasts and pericytes. CNN2 knockdown preserves kidney function and alleviates fibrosis. Global proteomics profiled that CNN2 knockdown enhanced the activities of the key rate-limiting enzymes and regulators of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in diseased kidneys. Inhibiting carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 in the FAO pathway results in lipid accumulation and extracellular matrix deposition in the fibrotic kidneys, which were restored after CNN2 knockdown. In patients, increased serum CNN2 levels are correlated with lipid content. Bioinformatics and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that CNN2 interactor, estrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) binds peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR) to transcriptionally regulate FAO downstream target genes expression amid kidney fibrosis. In vitro, ESR2 knockdown repressed the mRNA levels of PPAR and the key genes in the FAO pathway. Conversely, activation of PPAR reduced CNN2-induced matrix inductions. Our results suggest that balancing cell mechanics and metabolism is crucial to develop therapeutic strategies to halt kidney fibrosis.",

We suspected methodological issues and systematically investigated the concentration-dependency of RA. RA treatment increased IKur concentration-dependently from 1.1{+/-}0.54 pA/pF (0 RA) to 3.8{+/-}1.1, 5.8{+/-}2.5 and 12.2{+/-}4.3 at 0.01, 0.1 and 1 {micro}M, respectively. Only 1 {micro}M RA induced enough IKur to fully reproduce human atrial AP shape and a robust shortening of action potentials (AP) upon carbachol. We found that sterile filtration caused substantial loss of RA. We conclude that 1 {micro}M RA appears necessary and sufficient to induce a full atrial AP shape in hiPSC-CM in EHT format. RA concentrations are prone to methodological issues and may profoundly impact success of atrial differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Engineering microbes to synthesize molecules of societal value has historically been a time consuming and artisanal process, with the synthesis of each new non-native molecule typically warranting its own separate publication. Because most microbial strain engineering efforts leverage a finite number of common metabolic engineering design tactics, we reasoned that automating these design steps would help create a pipeline that can quickly, cheaply, and reliably generate so-called microbial factories. In this work we describe the design and implementation of a computational system, an Automated Scientist we call Lila, which handles all metabolic engineering design and optimization through the design-build-test-learn (DBTL) paradigm. Lila generates metabolic routes, identifies relevant genetic elements for perturbation, and specifies the design and re-design of microbial strains in a matter of seconds to minutes. Strains specified by Lila are then built and subsequently phenotyped as part of a largely automated in-house pipeline. Humans remain in-the-loop to curate choices made by the system, helping for example to refine the metabolic model or suggest custom protein modifications. Lila attempted to build strains that could produce 454 biochemically diverse molecules with precursors located broadly throughout the metabolism of two microbial hosts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. Notably, we observed the highest published titers for the molecule naringenin, the metabolic precursor to flavonoids. In total we created hundreds of thousands of microbial strains capable of overproducing 242 molecules, of which 180 are not native to S. cerevisiae or E. coli.",

Defective mitochondrial function has been hypothesized to contribute to 22q11.2DS pathogenesis; however, which of the six mitochondrial genes contribute to neurodevelopmental phenotypes and their underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. To systematically test 22q11.2DS genes for functional roles in neurodevelopment and behavior, we generated genetic mutants for each of the 37 conserved zebrafish orthologs and performed high throughput behavioral phenotyping using seven behavioral assays. Through this unbiased approach, we identified five single-gene mutants with partially overlapping behavioral phenotypes. Two of these genes, mrpl40 and prodha, encode for mitochondrial proteins and, similar to what we observed in mrpl40 and prodha mutants, pharmacologic inhibition of mitochondrial function during development results in microcephaly. Finally, we show that both mrpl40 and prodha mutants display neural stem and progenitor cell phenotypes, with each gene regulating different neural stem cell populations. Combined, our results demonstrate a critical role for mitochondrial function in neural stem and progenitor cell populations in the developing vertebrate brain and provide compelling evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction during neurodevelopment is linked to brain volume and behavioral phenotypes observed in models of 22q11.2DS.",

    "abstract": "The same types of cells can assume diverse states with varying functionalities. Effective cell therapy can be achieved by specifically driving a desirable cell state, which requires the elucidation of key transcription factors (TFs). Here, we integrated epigenomic and transcriptomic data at the systems level to identify TFs that define different CD8+ T cell states in an unbiased manner. These TF profiles can be used for cell state programming that aims to maximize the therapeutic potential of T cells. For example, T cells can be programmed to avoid a terminal exhaustion state (TexTerm), a dysfunctional T cell state that is often found in tumors or chronic infections. However, TexTerm exhibits high similarity with the beneficial tissue-resident memory T states (TRM) in terms of their locations and transcription profiles. Our bioinformatic analysis predicted Zscan20, a novel TF, to be uniquely active in TexTerm. Consistently, Zscan20 knock-out thwarted the differentiation of TexTerm in vivo, but not that of TRM. Furthermore, perturbation of Zscan20 programs T cells into an effector-like state that confers superior tumor and virus control and synergizes with immune checkpoint therapy. We also identified Jdp2 and Nfil3 as powerful TexTerm drivers. In short, our multiomics-based approach discovered novel TFs that enhance anti-tumor immunity, and enable highly effective cell state programming.\n\nOne sentence summaryMultiomics atlas enables the systematic identification of cell-state specifying transcription factors for therapeutic cell state programming.",

To explore NIR resistance we designed mutations to impair binding of NIR over substrate. Using 12 Omicron (BA.1) and WA.1 SARS-CoV-2 replicons, cell-based complementation and enzymatic assays, we showed that in both strains, E166V imparted high NIR resistance ([~]55-fold), with major decrease in WA1 replicon fitness ([~]20-fold), but not BA.1 ([~]2-fold). WA1 replicon fitness was restored by L50F. These differences may contribute to a potentially lower barrier to resistance in Omicron than WA1. E166V is rare in untreated patients, albeit more prevalent in paxlovid-treated EPIC-HR clinical trial patients. Importantly, NIR-resistant replicons with E166V or E166V/L50F remained susceptible to a) the flexible GC376, and b) PF-00835231, which forms additional interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations show steric clashes between the rigid and bulky NIR t-butyl and {beta}-branched V166 distancing the NIR warhead from its Cys145 target.

    "abstract": "Culture based detection remains to be one of the most reliable and acceptable techniques to detect extremely low quantity pathogens present in a sample. The process typically involves inoculating the sample on an agar plate to allow growth of the microorganisms to form colonies, followed by the identification of the individual colonies, commonly by DNA sequencing of a PCR-amplified targeted gene. Sanger method is often the default choice of sequencing as it offers affordable and accurate results for a single species. However, the technique could pose limitations in certain situations such as identification of multi-species microbial colonies. In this work, we compared the performance of Sanger sequencing with MinION nanopore sequencing in identifying bacterial colonies derived from bioaerosol samples. We conducted Sanger and nanopore sequencing of full-length 16S rRNA genes from seven bacterial colonies derived from bioaerosol samples and compared the outcome by alignment against NCBI 16S reference database. We found that for five out of seven colonies both techniques indicated the presence of the same bacterial genus. For one of the remaining colonies, a noisy Sanger electropherogram failed to generate a meaningful sequence, but nanopore sequencing identified it to be a mix of two bacterial genera Alkalihalobacillus and Kocuria. For the other remaining colony, the Sanger sequencing suggested Micrococcus with a clean electropherogram, however, the nanopore sequencing suggested the presence of an additional genus Paraburkholderia. Further corroborating these findings with mock multispecies colonies from pure bacterial DNA samples, we confirm that nanopore sequencing is comparable to the Sanger method in identifying colonies with single bacterial species but is the superior method in classifying individual bacterial components with their relative abundances in multispecies colonies. Our results suggest that nanopore sequencing could be advantageous over Sanger sequencing for colony identification in culture-based analysis of environmental samples such as bioaerosol where direct inoculation of the sample to culture plate might lead to formation of multispecies colonies.",

    "abstract": "Burkholderia multivorans is the dominant Burkholderia pathogen recovered from lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis. However, as an understudied pathogen there are knowledge gaps in relation to its population biology, phenotypic traits and useful model strains. A phylogenomic study of B. multivorans was undertaken using a total of 283 genomes, of which 73 were sequenced and 49 phenotypically characterized as part of this study. Average nucleotide identity analysis (ANI) and phylogenetic alignment of core genes demonstrated that the B. multivorans population separated into two distinct evolutionary clades, defined as lineage 1 (n = 58 genomes) and lineage 2 (n = 221 genomes). To examine the population biology of B. multivorans, a representative subgroup of 77 B. multivorans genomes (28 from the reference databases and the 49-novel short-read genome sequences) were selected based on multilocus sequence typing (MLST), isolation source and phylogenetic placement criteria. Comparative genomics was used to identify B. multivorans lineage-specific genes: ghrB_1 in lineage 1, and glnM_2 in lineage 2, and diagnostic PCRs targeting them successfully developed. Phenotypic analysis of 49 representative B. multivorans strains showed considerable variance with the majority of isolates tested being motile and capable of biofilm formation. A striking absence of B. multivorans protease activity in vitro was observed, but no lineage-specific phenotypic differences demonstrated. Using phylogenomic and phenotypic criteria, three model B. multivorans CF strains were identified, BCC0084 (lineage 1), BCC1272 (lineage 2a) and BCC0033 lineage 2b, and their complete genome sequences determined. B. multivorans CF strains BCC0033 and BCC0084, and the environmental reference strain, ATCC 17616, were all capable of short-term survival within a murine lung infection model. By mapping the population biology, identifying lineage-specific PCRs and model strains, we provide much needed baseline resources for future studies of B. multivorans.",

    "abstract": "A novel multidrug efflux pump, AadT from the Drug:H+ antiporter 2 family, was discovered in Acinetobacter multidrug resistance plasmids. Here, we profiled the antimicrobial resistance potential and examined the distribution of this gene. Putative homologs of this efflux pump were encoded in many Acinetobacter species and other Gram-negative species, and were genetically associated with novel variants of adeAB(C), which encodes a major tripartite efflux pump in Acinetobacter. The AadT pump conferred decreased susceptibility to at least eight diverse antimicrobials, including antibiotics erythromycin, tetracycline; biocides chlorhexidine; and dyes ethidium bromide and DAPI. These results show that AadT is a new determinant in the Acinetobacter resistance arsenal and may cooperate with variants of AdeAB(C).",

    "abstract": "Transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) can enhance insect resistance to insecticides by regulating the detoxification metabolic network. Our previous studies have confirmed that overexpression of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are both involved in lambda-cyhalothrin resistance in Cydia pomonella. In this study, we report that AhR regulates GSTs thus conferring lambda-cyhalothrin resistance in C. pomonella. Spatiotemporal expression patterns indicated that AhR gene of C. pomonella (CpAhR) was highly expressed in the Malpighian tubules of larvae. Moreover, the expression of CpAhR was induced by lambda-cyhalothrin exposure and was up-regulated in a lambda-cyhalothrin-resistant population. RNA interference (RNAi) of the expression of CpAhR could effectively decrease the relative expression level of CpGSTe3 and enzyme activity of GSTs, but not P450s, further reducing the tolerance of larvae to lambda-cyhalothrin. Furthermore, {beta}-naphthoflavone (BNF), a novel agonist of AhR, can effectively increase the expression of CpAhR and the activity of the GSTs enzyme, resulting in the enhancement of larvae tolerance to lambda-cyhalothrin. These results demonstrate that lambda-cyhalothrin exposure can effectively activate the expression of CpAhR and increase GSTs enzyme thus leading to the development of resistance to lambda-cyhalothrin, which enriches the theory of insecticide resistance regulation in C. pomonella.",

We show the microtubules in the tip are highly cross-linked with each other and stabilised by luminal proteins, plugs and cap proteins at the plus ends. In the tip region, the central pair lacks the typical projections and twists significantly. By analysing cells lacking a ciliary tip-enriched protein CEP104/FAP256 by cryo-electron tomography and proteomics, we discovered candidates for the central pair cap complex and explain potential functions of CEP104/FAP256.

    "abstract": "The transition from a lytic to lysogenic life cycle is the most important feature of the life history of temperate viruses. To develop an evolutionary explanation for this transition, a new model of phage/bacteria population dynamics is introduced and analyzed. The original delay-differential equation model of Campbell (1961) for the population dynamics of virulent phage and bacteria is critiqued, revealing the need for a new model. The new model features infection of bacteria by Poisson sampling of virions from the environment and is developed in discrete time with a time step equal to the viral latency time.\n\nAccording to the new model, density-dependent burst size does not lead to virus/bacteria coexistence whereas density-dependent viral absorption onto the bacterial surface is sufficient to produce virulent virus/bacteria coexistence.\n\nThe condition for transition from a lytic to lysogenic phase is derived from the new model as a formula termed the \"fitness switch\". The virus switches from lytic to lysogenic when its population grows faster as prophage than as virions produced by lysis of the infected cells. A prophage that happens to benefit the bacterium it infects automatically incurs lower fitness upon leaving the bacterial genome, resulting in its becoming locked into the bacterial genome in what is termed as a \"prophage lock\".\n\nThe fitness switch predicts that environmental enrichment leads to microbialization, fluctuating environmental conditions promote horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and prophage-containing bacteria can integrate into the microbiome of a eukaryotic host forming a functionally integrated tripartite holobiont. Predictions from the fitness switch accord more with the \"Piggyback-the-Winner\" hypothesis than with the \"Kill-the-Winner\" hypothesis in virus ecology.",

Recent focus on paralog synthetic lethality in cancer cells offers an opportunity to evaluate different CRISPR/Cas multiplexing technologies and improve on the state of the art. Here we report a meta-analysis of CRISPR genetic interactions screens, identifying a candidate set of background-independent paralog synthetic lethals, and find that the CRISPR/enCas12a platform provides superior sensitivity and assay replicability. We demonstrate that enCas12a can independently target up to four genes from a single guide array, and build on this knowledge by constructing a one-component library that expresses arrays of four guides per clone, a platform we call  in4mer. Our genome-scale human library, with only 44k clones, is substantially smaller than a typical CRISPR/Cas9 monogenic library while also targeting more than two thousand paralog pairs, triples, and quads. Proof of concept screens in two cell lines demonstrate discrimination of core and context-dependent essential genes similar to that of state of the art CRISPR/Cas9 libraries, as well as detection of synthetic lethal and masking (also known as buffering) genetic interactions between paralogs of various family sizes, a capability not offered by any extant library. Importantly, the in4mer platform offers a fivefold reduction in the number of clones required to assay genetic interactions, dramatically improving the cost and effort required for these studies.",

It has attracted considerable interest to design ligands for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. To develop a novel class of 7 ligands, we recently generated two nanobodies named E3 and C4 acting as positive and silent allosteric modulators respectively. Here, we solved the cryo-EM structures of the nanobody-receptor complexes. E3 and C4 bind to a common epitope involving two subunits at the apex of the receptor. They form by themselves a symmetric pentameric assembly that extends the extracellular domain. Unlike C4, the binding of E3 drives an active or desensitized conformation in the absence of orthosteric agonist, and mutational analysis shows a key contribution of a N-linked sugar moiety in mediating E3 potentiation. The nanobody E3, by remotely controlling the global allosteric conformation of the receptor, implements an original mechanism of regulation which opens new avenues for drug design.",

    "abstract": "Neurons ubiquitously display heterogeneities in spiking activity even within a given cell type. To date, the relative contributions of extrinsic mechanisms (e.g., synaptic bombardment) and intrinsic mechanisms (e.g., conductances, cell morphology) towards determining spiking activity remain poorly understood. Here we address this important question using a novel approach that combines biophysical techniques, in which extracellular in vivo recordings of electrosensory pyramidal cells within weakly electric fish, are combined with computational modeling. Specifically, by varying parameters, a conductance-based computational model successfully reproduced the highly heterogeneous spiking activities seen experimentally. Model parameters that varied the most were then used to gauge the relative contributions of extrinsic vs. intrinsic mechanisms. Overall, extrinsic synaptic input was predicted to be the main factor accounting for spiking heterogeneities. We tested this prediction experimentally by performing two different manipulations: i) pharmacologically inactivating feedback; ii) applying the neuromodulator serotonin. Our model predicted that feedback inactivation should reduce while serotonin application should increase spiking heterogeneities. Experiments corroborated these predictions. Importantly, for serotonin application, increased heterogeneity occurred despite a strong reduction in intrinsic membrane conductance, further demonstrating that extrinsic synaptic input is the primary determinant of spiking heterogeneities in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate that devising a computational model to capture spiking heterogeneities in vivo and assessing which parameters are responsible can successfully determine the relative contributions of extrinsic vs. intrinsic inputs. We expect this approach to be generalizable to other systems and species.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular complications are seen among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals who can now survive longer due to successful antiretroviral therapies. Among them, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a fatal disease characterized by increased blood pressure in the lung circulation due to vasoconstriction and vascular wall remodeling, resulting in the overworking of the heart. The prevalence of PAH in the HIVpositive population is dramatically higher than that in the general population. While HIV-1 Group M Subtype B is the most prevalent subtype in western countries, the majority of HIV-1 infections in eastern Africa and former Soviet Union countries are caused by Subtype A. Research on the mechanism of vascular complications in the HIV-positive population, especially in the context of subtype differences, however, has not been rigorous. Much of the research on HIV has focused on Subtype B and information on the molecular mechanisms of Subtype A is non-existent. The lack of such knowledge results in health disparities in the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent/treat HIV complications. The present study examined the effects of HIV-1 viral fusion protein gp120 of Subtypes A and B on cultured human pulmonary artery endothelial cells by performing protein arrays. We found that the gene expression changes caused by the gp120s of Subtypes A and B are different. Specifically, Subtype A is a more potent downregulator of perostasin, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and ErbB/Her3 than Subtype B, while Subtype B is more effective in downregulating monocyte chemotactic protein-2 (MCP-2/CCL8), MCP-3 (CCL7), and thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17) proteins. This is the first report of gp120 proteins affecting host cells in an HIV subtype-specific manner, opening up the possibility that vascular complications may occur differently in HIV patients throughout the world.",

We find that auditory or visual distractors selectively impair visual discrimination performance in both humans and mice with FXS, but not their typically developing controls. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) neurons were significantly modulated by incorrect responses in the post-stimulus period during early distractor trials in WT mice, consistent with their known role as  error signals. Strikingly, however, VIP cells from Fmr1-/- mice showed little modulation in error trials, and this correlated with their poor performance on the distractor task. Thus, VIP interneurons and their reduced modulatory influence on pyramidal cells, could be a potential therapeutic target for attentional difficulties in FXS.",

    "abstract": "The plasma membrane is widely regarded as the hub of the signal transduction network activities that drives numerous physiological responses, including cell polarity and migration. Yet, the symmetry breaking process in the membrane, that leads to dynamic compartmentalization of different proteins, remains poorly understood. Using multimodal live-cell imaging, here we first show that multiple endogenous and synthetic lipid-anchored proteins, despite maintaining stable tight association with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, were unexpectedly depleted from the membrane domains where the signaling network was spontaneously activated such as in the new protrusions as well as within the propagating ventral waves. Although their asymmetric patterns resembled those of standard peripheral \"back\" proteins such as PTEN, unlike the latter, these lipidated proteins did not dissociate from the membrane upon global receptor activation. Our experiments not only discounted the possibility of recurrent reversible translocation from membrane to cytosol as it occurs for weakly bound peripheral membrane proteins, but also ruled out the necessity of directed vesicular trafficking and cytoskeletal supramolecular structure-based restrictions in driving these dynamic symmetry breaking events. Selective photoconversion-based protein tracking assays suggested that these asymmetric patterns instead originate from the inherent ability of these membrane proteins to \"dynamically partition\" into distinct domains within the plane of the membrane. Consistently, single-molecule measurements showed that these lipid-anchored molecules have substantially dissimilar diffusion profiles in different regions of the membrane. When these profiles were incorporated into an excitable network-based stochastic reaction-diffusion model of the system, simulations revealed that our proposed \"dynamic partitioning\" mechanism is sufficient to give rise to familiar asymmetric propagating wave patterns. Moreover, we demonstrated that normally uniform integral and lipid-anchored membrane proteins in Dictyostelium and mammalian neutrophil cells can be induced to partition spatiotemporally to form polarized patterns, by optogenetically recruiting membrane domain-specific peptides to these proteins. Together, our results indicate \"dynamic partitioning\" as a new mechanism of plasma membrane organization, that can account for large-scale compartmentalization of a wide array of lipid-anchored and integral membrane proteins in different physiological processes.",

    "abstract": "Over the last several years, a method has emerged which endows adult hepatocytes with in vitro proliferative capacity, producing chemically-induced liver progenitors (CLiPs). However, a recent study questioned the origin of these cells, suggesting that resident liver progenitor cells, but not hepatocytes, proliferate. Here, we provide lineage tracing-based evidence that adult hepatocytes acquire proliferative capacity in vitro. Unexpectedly, we also found that the CLiP method allows biliary epithelial cells to acquire extensive proliferative capacity. Interestingly, after long-term culture, hepatocyte-derived cells (hepCLiPs) and biliary-derived cells (bilCLiPs) become similar in their gene expression patterns, and they both exhibit differentiation capacity to form hepatocyte-like cells. Finally, we provide evidence that hepCLiPs can repopulate chronically injured mouse livers, reinforcing our earlier argument that CLiPs can be a cell source for liver regenerative medicine. Moreover, this study offers bilCLiPs as a potential cell source for liver regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary theories of foraging hypothesize that individual foraging strategies evolved to maximize search efficiency. Many studies have investigated the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation and how individual foragers manage them. However, for groups of foragers, these trade-offs can change and individual search strategies may evolve in response to their social environments. For instance, foragers may use social information to collectively find and harvest resources, which might increase competition and decrease the benefits of exploring new resources. Previous work has shown that when learning socially, it is optimal for groups to be composed of highly explorative strategies. However, individual and collective search efficiencies may not align if individual search strategies beneficial for the group are disadvantageous for the individuals. In the present study, we use an agent-based model to investigate the effect of collective foraging on the evolution of individual search strategies and how they relate to group search efficiency. We use a genetic algorithm to evolve Levy walk exponents ({micro}) that govern the balance of explorative versus exploitative foraging. We show that groups can evolve with social learning whose collective performance is more optimal than without social learning. The model shows that exploiters have a selective advantage in scrounging off findings by other agents, but too many exploiters diminished group search efficiencies. We also show that social learning in large groups can increase the payoffs of exploration and lead to the selection of more exploratory groups. Finally, we show that area-restricted search can help explorers exploit found resources and lead to more efficient collective search. Our results demonstrate how exploration and exploitation must be balanced at both individual and collective levels, and how individual search strategies can evolve to the benefit of collective search efficiency.",

    "abstract": "In order to better understand the relationship between normal and neoplastic brain, we combined five publicly available large-scale datasets, correcting for batch effects and applying Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to RNA-seq data. We assembled a reference Brain-UMAP including 702 adult gliomas, 802 pediatric tumors and 1409 healthy normal brain samples, which can be utilized to investigate the wealth of information obtained from combining several publicly available datasets to study a single organ site. Normal brain regions and tumor types create distinct clusters and because the landscape is generated by RNA seq, comparative gene expression profiles and gene ontology patterns are readily evident. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis that allows for comparison of gene expression and pathways of interest across adult gliomas, pediatric brain tumors, and normal brain regions. We provide access to this resource via the open source, interactive online tool Oncoscape, where the scientific community can readily visualize clinical metadata, gene expression patterns, gene fusions, mutations, and copy number patterns for individual genes and pathway over this reference landscape.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells, both within a developing tumor and during metastatic spread, encounter many stresses that require adaptive mechanisms to survive and maintain malignant progression. Here we describe a signaling complex involving the small GTPase Cdc42 and Dock7, a Cdc42/Rac GEF and unique Cdc42-effector, that has a previously unappreciated role in regulating AKT, mTOR, and other mTOR signaling and regulatory partners including the TSC1/TCS2 complex and S6K during serum starvation. Dock7 is highly expressed in triple-negative breast cancers and is essential for the malignant properties in nutrient-deprived growth conditions of several cancer cell lines. We find that Dock7 interacts with phosphorylated AKT to maintain a low, but critical activation of a rapamycin-sensitive and Raptor-independent mTORC1-like activity required for survival during nutrient stress. Following the knock-out of Dock7 from cancer cells, interactions between AKT and the phosphatase PHLPP increased while phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 decreased, suggesting Dock7 protects AKT from dephosphorylation. The DHR1 domain of Dock7, previously of unknown function, is responsible for maintaining AKT Ser473 phosphorylation during serum starvation through an interaction requiring its C2-like motif. Together, these findings indicate that Dock7 protects and maintains the phosphorylation of AKT to sustain a tonic mTOR/S6K activity in cancer cells necessary for their resistance to anoikis and to prevent them from undergoing apoptosis during stressful conditions.",

    "abstract": "Coral reefs are being degraded at unprecedented rates and decisive intervention actions are urgently needed to help them. One such intervention in aid of reefs is coral cryopreservation. Although the cryopreservation of coral sperm and larvae has been achieved, preservation of coral fragments including both its tissue and skeleton, has not. The goal of this paper was to understand and assess the physiological stressors that might underlie coral fragment cryopreservation and the long-term consequences of these physiological exposures to continued growth. Therefore, we assessed small fragments ([~]0.5 x0.5 mm2) from the Hawaiian coral, Porites compressa, examining: 1) the sensitivity of the fragments and their algal symbionts to chilling temperatures; 2) the sensitivity of the coral to complex cryoprotectants; 3) methods to safely remove the algal symbionts from the coral fragment for cryopreservation, given the two symbiotic partners may require different cryopreservation protocols; 4) continued growth over time of coral fragments once returned to running seawater after treatment exposures; and, 5) assessment of health and viability of microfragments after treatments examining the distribution of green fluorescent protein and fluorescent symbionts. Technological advances in cryo-technology promise to support successful coral fragment cryopreservation soon, and its success could help secure much of the genetic and biodiversity of reefs in the next decade.",
