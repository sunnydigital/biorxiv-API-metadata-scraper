    "abstract": "RNA is a remarkably versatile molecule that has been engineered for applications in therapeutics, diagnostics, and in vivo information-processing systems. However, the complex relationship between the sequence and structural properties of an RNA molecule and its ability to perform specific functions often necessitates extensive experimental screening of candidate sequences. Here we present a generalized neural network architecture that utilizes the sequence and structure of RNA molecules (SANDSTORM) to inform functional predictions. We demonstrate that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across several distinct RNA prediction tasks, while learning interpretable abstractions of RNA secondary structure. We paired these predictive models with generative adversarial RNA design networks (GARDN), allowing the generative modelling of novel mRNA 5 untranslated regions and toehold switch riboregulators exhibiting a predetermined fitness. This approach enabled the design of novel toehold switches with a 43-fold increase in experimentally characterized dynamic range compared to those designed using classic thermodynamic algorithms. SANDSTORM and GARDN thus represent powerful new predictive and generative tools for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic RNA molecules with improved function.",

    "abstract": "For a profound understanding of the mechanisms of antagonistic coevolution, it is necessary to identify the coevolving genes. The spore-forming bacterium Pasteuria ramosa and its host, the microcrustacean Daphnia, are a well-characterized paradigm for co-evolution, but the underlying genes remain largely unknown. A genome-wide association study identified a polymorphic carboxy-terminal globular domain of Pasteuria collagen-like protein 7 (Pcl7) as a candidate mediating parasite attachment and driving its coevolution with the host. Since P. ramosa cannot currently be genetically manipulated, we used Bacillus thuringiensis as a surrogate parasite to express a fusion protein of a Pcl7 carboxy-terminus from P. ramosa and the amino-terminal domain of a B. thuringiensis collagen-like protein. Mutant B. thuringiensis (Pcl7-Bt) spores but not wild-type B. thuringiensis (WT-Bt) spores, attached to the same site of susceptible hosts as P. ramosa. Furthermore, Pcl7-Bt spores attached readily to host genotypes that were susceptible to the P. ramosa clone that was the origin of the Pcl7 C-terminus, but only slightly to resistant host genotypes. These findings indicated that the fusion protein was properly expressed and folded and demonstrated that indeed the C-terminus of Pcl7 mediates attachment in a host genotype-specific manner. These results provide strong evidence for the involvement of a CLP in the coevolution of Daphnia and P. ramosa and opens new avenues for genetic epidemiological studies of host-parasite interactions.\n\n150-word \"Importance\" paragraphDuring host-parasite coevolution, hosts evolve to evade the damaging effect of the parasite, while parasites evolve to maximize their benefits by exploiting the host. The genes underlying this coevolution remain largely unknown. For the prime model-system for coevolutionary research, the crustacean Daphnia and the parasite Pasteuria ramosa, collagen-like proteins (CLPs) in Pasteuria were suggested to play a crucial role for host-parasite interactions. Here we report that transferring part of a CLP coding gene from the unculturable P. ramosa to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), confirmed the function of this protein as a genotype-specific adhesin to the hosts cuticle. Our finding highlights the importance of a CLP in host-parasite interactions and will enable us to explore the population genetic dynamics of coevolution in this system.",

The bacterium shows genomic flexibility and ability to colonise diverse ecological niches, with recent genomic studies proposing the existence of hospital-associated lineages. In this study, we investigated the genetic and ecological drivers underlying the species evolution. Comparative genomic analyses revealed a population composed of five deeply-demarcated genetic clusters, with independent adaptive trajectories emphasised by profound genetic differences and diverse isolation sources. The clusters also show limited inter-cluster gene flow, partially explained by Restriction-Modification (R-M) systems incompatibility. The clusters emergence dates back to thousands years ago, suggesting that major adaptation events long pre-dated the origin of modern hospitals. Furthermore, metagenomic investigation revealed that the hospital-associated cluster is not enriched in the human gut, possibly having a fresh/marine water reservoir. Overall, this study revisits the diversity of Serratia marcescens in light of ecological and genetic barriers.",

    "abstract": "Proteins are evolved molecular machines whose diverse biochemical functions are (also) dynamically regulated by allostery, through which even faraway protein residues can conformationally communicate. Allostery can express itself in different ways, akin to different \"languages\": allosteric control pathways predominating in an unperturbed protein are superseded by others as soon as a perturbation arises--e.g, mutation--that alters its function (pathologically or not). Accurately modeling these often-unintuitive phenomena could therefore help explain functional changes in a specific protein whenever they are unclear. Unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a possibility; however, since allostery can operate at longer timescales than those accessible by MD, simulations require integration with a reliable method able to, e.g., detect regions of incipient allosteric change, or likely perturbation pathways. Several such (valid) methods exist, but are typically applied singularly, only yielding a partial (\"monolinguistic\") picture of allostery: we argue their joint application could significantly enrich this picture. To prove this, we perform unbiased MD simulations ([~]100 {micro}s) of the widely studied, allosterically active oncotarget K-Ras4B, solvated and embedded in a phospholipid membrane, proceeding to decrypt its allostery using four showcase \"languages\": Distance Fluctuation analysis and the Shortest Path Map capture allosteric communication hotspots at equilibrium; Anisotropic Thermal Diffusion and Dynamic Non-Equilibrium MD assess them once the GTP that oncogenically activates K-Ras4B is, respectively, either superheated or hydrolyzed. \"Languages\" provide a uniquely articulate, mutually coherent, experimentally consistent picture of allostery in K-Ras4B. At equilibrium, pathways stretch from the membrane-embedded hypervariable region all the way to the active site, touching known flexible allosteric \"switches\" and proposed pockets. Upon GTP cleavage/perturbation, known to inactivate K-Ras4B, allosteric signals most reverberate on switches and interfaces that recruit effector proteins. Our work highlights the benefits of integrating different allostery detection methods, even in conjunction with unbiased MD.",

    "abstract": "Transcription, a critical process in molecular biology, has found many applications in RNA synthesis, including mRNA vaccines and RNA therapeutics. However, current RNA characterization technologies suffer from amplification and enzymatic biases that lead to loss of native information. Here, we introduce a strategy to quantitatively study both transcription and RNA polymerase behaviour by sizing RNA with RNA nanotechnology and nanopores. To begin, we utilized T7 RNA polymerase to transcribe linear DNA lacking termination sequences. Surprisingly, we discovered alternative transcription termination in the origin of replication sequence. Next, we employed circular DNA without transcription terminators to perform rolling circle transcription. This allowed us to gain valuable insights into the processivity and transcription behaviour of RNA polymerase at the single-molecule level. Our work demonstrates how RNA nanotechnology and nanopores may be used in tandem for the direct and quantitative analysis of RNA transcripts. This methodology provides a promising pathway for accurate RNA structural mapping by enabling the study of full-length RNA transcripts at the single-molecule level.",

However, their relationship to synaptic structure and functional activity is unknown. We examined a correlative dataset from ferret visual cortex with in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of dendritic spines during visual stimulation and electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions of spine ultrastructure, investigating mitochondrial abundance near functionally- and structurally-characterized spines. Surprisingly, we found no correlation to structural measures of synaptic strength. Instead, we found that mitochondria are positioned near spines with orientation preferences that are dissimilar to the somatic preference. Additionally, we found that mitochondria are positioned near groups of spines with heterogeneous orientation preferences. For a subset of spines with a mitochondrion in the head or neck, synapses were larger and exhibited greater selectivity to visual stimuli than those without a mitochondrion. Our data suggest mitochondria are not necessarily positioned to support the energy needs of strong spines, but rather support the structurally and functionally diverse inputs innervating the basal dendrites of cortical neurons.",

In songbirds, this process continues throughout life, but how these newborn neurons disperse through the adult brain is unclear. We addressed this question using in vivo two-photon imaging in transgenic songbirds that express GFP in young neurons. In juvenile and adult birds, migratory cells were present at a high density, traveled in all directions, and made frequent course changes. Notably, these dynamic migration patterns were well fit by a superdiffusive model. Simulations revealed that these diffusion-like dynamics were sufficient to disperse new neurons throughout the song nucleus HVC. These results suggest that diffusion-like migration may underlie the formation and maintenance of nuclear brain structures in the postnatal brain and indicate that transgenic songbirds are a useful resource for future studies into the mechanisms of adult neurogenesis.\n\nHighlightsO_LITransgenic songbirds express GFP in a neurogenic lineage\nC_LIO_LIGFP expression is strong and sparse enough to track single cells in vivo\nC_LIO_LIAdult neuron migration is well fit by a superdiffusive model\nC_LIO_LISuperdiffusive migration is sufficient to populate HVC in simulation\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Approximately seven per cent of children have developmental language disorder (DLD), a neurodevelopmental condition associated with persistent language learning difficulties without a known cause. Our understanding of the neurobiological basis of DLD is limited. Here, we used FreeSurfer to investigate cortical surface area and thickness in 54 children and adolescents with DLD and 74 age-matched controls aged 10-16 years. We also examined cortical asymmetries in DLD using an automated surface-based technique. Those with DLD showed smaller surface area bilaterally in the inferior frontal gyrus extending to the anterior insula, in the posterior temporal and ventral occipito-temporal cortex, and in portions of the anterior cingulate and superior frontal cortex. There were no differences in cortical thickness, nor in asymmetry of these cortical metrics. Post-hoc exploratory analyses revealed that surface area in the left fusiform and inferior frontal cortex related to childrens reading and non-word repetition scores, respectively. This study highlights the importance of distinguishing between surface area and cortical thickness in investigating the brain basis of neurodevelopmental disorders and suggests the development of cortical surface area to be of importance to DLD. Future longitudinal studies are required to understand the developmental trajectory of these cortical differences in DLD and how they relate to language maturation.",

    "abstract": "Self-control underlies goal-directed behaviour in humans and other animals. Delayed gratification - a measure of self-control - requires the ability to tolerate a delay and/or invest more effort to obtain a reward of higher value over one of lower value, such as food or mates. Social context, in particular, the presence of competitors, may influence delayed gratification. We adapted the  rotating-tray paradigm, where subjects need to forgo an immediate, lower-quality (i.e. less preferred) reward for a delayed, higher-quality (i.e. more preferred) one, to test social influences on delayed gratification in two corvid species: New Caledonian crows and Eurasian jays. We compared choices for immediate vs. delayed rewards while alone, in the presence of a competitive conspecific and in the presence of a non-competitive conspecific. We found that species differed: jays were more likely to select the immediate, less preferred reward than the crows. We also found that jays were more likely to select the immediate, less preferred reward when a competitor or non-competitor was present than when alone, or when a competitor was present compared to a non- competitor, while the crows selected the delayed, highly preferred reward irrespective of social presence. We discuss our findings in relation to species differences in socio-ecological factors (adult sociality and food caching) and wider implications of social influences on self-control.",

Despite numerous studies on neural correlates of reward prediction errors, the question of how large-scale brain networks reconfigure in response to reward prediction error signalling remains open. Here we ask how functional networks change in response to reward prediction errors depending on the context. In our study participants performed the probabilistic reversal learning task in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner in two experimental contexts: a reward-seeking setting and a punishment-avoiding. We found that the participants learning speed depended on the sign of the prediction error but not on the experimental context. Whole-brain network analysis revealed a multi-scale community structure with a separate striatal reward network emerging at a finer topological scale and a ventromedial prefrontal network emerging at a coarser scale. We also found that the integration between large-scale networks increased when switching from positive to negative prediction error events. This pattern of large-scale network reconfiguration aligns with the broad range of research showing increased network integration with increased cognitive demands. Our findings offer a first sketch of how processing reward prediction error affects the functional connectivity of brain-wide networks.",

The identity of synaptic lncRNAs and their functional role associated with synapse development and memory are poorly understood. We employed RNA-seq analysis of synaptoneurosomes to identify 94 synapse-enriched lncRNAs from the mouse hippocampus. We find Pvt1 to be a specific regulator of excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapse development in vivo. RNA-Seq from Pvt1 knockdown neurons identified down-regulated transcripts encoding pre- and post-synaptic proteins influencing synapse formation. This observation is congruent with reduction in mEPSC amplitude and frequency. We find a synapse-centric role for SynLAMP which is specifically transported to the synaptic compartment upon contextual fear conditioning (CFC) and regulate activity-dependent dendritic translation. CFC led to enhancement of interaction between SynLAMP and the translation repressor FUS, indicating SynLAMP to be a molecular decoy. SynLAMP RNAi partially occludes fear memory, suggesting an input-specific role of lncRNAs at the synapse.",

    "abstract": "The human visual system is equipped to rapidly and implicitly learn and exploit the statistical regularities in our environment. Within visual search, contextual cueing demonstrates how implicit knowledge of scenes can improve search performance. This is commonly interpreted as spatial context in the scenes becoming predictive of the target location, which leads to a more efficient guidance of attention during search. However, what drives this enhanced guidance is unknown. First, it is unclear whether improved attentional guidance is enabled by target enhancement or distractor suppression. Second, it is unknown whether the entire scene (global context) or more local drives this phenomenon. In the present MEG experiment, we leveraged Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT) to answer these two outstanding questions. We found that the improved performance when searching implicitly familiar scenes was accompanied by a stronger neural representation of the target stimulus, at the cost specifically of those distractors directly surrounding the target. Crucially, this biasing of local attentional competition was behaviorally relevant when searching familiar scenes, indicating that it is the local, and not global, spatial context that is modulated, culminating in a search advantage for familiar scenes. Taken together, we conclude that implicitly learned spatial predictive context improves how we search our environment by sharpening the attentional field.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are recognized as neural disconnectivity syndromes. Here, we establish a whole-brain immunostaining and quantification platform to investigate structural and functional connectivity in a Tbr1+/- autism mouse model, which shares a defect in the anterior commissure that is evolutionarily conserved with human patients. Since the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is particularly susceptible to Tbr1 haploinsufficiency and it projects to the contralateral brain hemisphere via the anterior commissure, we express a channelrhodopsin variant oChIEF fused with Citrine at the BLA to outline axonal projections of BLA neurons and to activate the BLA under blue light theta-burst stimulation (TBS). Next, we evaluate C-FOS expression to represent neural activity. We show that Tbr1 haploinsufficiency almost completely disrupts contralateral BLA axonal projections and results in ipsilateral mistargeting, thereby globally altering BLA functional connectivity. Based on correlated C-FOS expression among brain regions, we further report that Tbr1 deficiency severely disrupts whole-brain synchronization in the absence of salient stimulation. Tbr1+/- and wild-type mice exhibit opposing responses to TBS-induced amygdalar activation, with it reducing synchronization in wild-type mice but enhancing it in Tbr1+/- mice. Whole-brain modular organization and inter-module connectivity are also affected by Tbr1 deficiency and amygdalar activation. In fact, the synchronization and intra- and inter-modular connectivities of TBS-treated Tbr1+/- mice are more comparable to those of non-treated wild-type mice, suggesting a potential ameliorating effect of amygdalar stimulation on brain function. Moreover, Tbr1+/- mice exhibit attenuated connectivity between the amygdala and default mode network, a subnetwork highly relevant to social behaviors, strengthening the link between the impaired connectivity and social behavior deficits displayed by Tbr1+/- mice. Our high-resolution analytical platform reveals the inter- and intra-hemispheric connectopathies arising from an ASD condition and emphasizes the defective synchronization at a whole-brain scale caused by Tbr1 deficiency.",
