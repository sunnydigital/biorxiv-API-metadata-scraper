    "abstract": "The locus coeruleus (LC), a small subcortical structure in the brainstem, is the brains principal source of norepinephrine. It plays a primary role in regulating stress, the sleep-wake cycle, and attention, and its degradation is associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases associated with cognitive deficits (e.g., Parkinsons, Alzheimers). Yet precisely how norepinephrine drives brain networks to support healthy cognitive function remains poorly understood - partly because LCs small size makes it difficult to study noninvasively in humans. Here, we characterized LCs influence on brain dynamics using a hidden Markov model fitted to functional neuroimaging data from healthy young adults across four attention-related brain networks and LC. We modulated LC activity using a behavioral paradigm and measured individual differences in LC magnetization transfer contrast. The model revealed five hidden states, including a stable state dominated by salience-network activity that occurred when subjects actively engaged with the task. LC magnetization transfer contrast correlated with this states stability across experimental manipulations and with subjects propensity to enter into and remain in this state. These results provide new insight into LCs role in driving spatiotemporal neural patterns associated with attention, and demonstrate that variation in LC integrity can explain individual differences in these patterns even in healthy young adults.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development and open-source release of highly performant computer vision models offers new potential for examining how different inductive biases impact representation learning and emergent alignment with the high-level human ventral visual system. Here, we assess a diverse set of 224 models, curated to enable controlled comparison of different model properties, testing their brain predictivity using large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging data. We find that models with qualitatively different architectures (e.g. CNNs versus Transformers) and markedly different task objectives (e.g. purely visual contrastive learning versus vision-language alignment) achieve near equivalent degrees of brain predictivity, when other factors are held constant. Instead, variation across model visual training diets yields the largest, most consistent effect on emergent brain predictivity. Overarching model properties commonly suspected to increase brain predictivity (e.g. greater effective dimensionality; learnable parameter count) were not robust indicators across this more extensive survey. We highlight that standard model-to-brain linear re-weighting methods may be too flexible, as most performant models have very similar brain-predictivity scores, despite significant variation in their underlying representations. Broadly, our findings point to the importance of visual diet, challenge common assumptions about the methods used to link models to brains, and more concretely outline future directions for leveraging the full diversity of existing open-source models as tools to probe the common computational principles underlying biological and artificial visual systems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNon-enhancing (NE) infiltrating tumor cells beyond the contrast-enhancing (CE) bulk of tumor are potential propagators of recurrence after gross total resection of high-grade glioma.\n\nMethodsWe leveraged single-nucleus RNA-sequencing on 15 specimens from 5 high grade gliomas to compare prospectively identified biopsy specimens acquired from CE and NE regions. Additionally, 24 CE and 22 NE biopsies had immunohistochemical staining for Ki67 to identify proliferative cell burden.\n\nResultsTumor cells in NE regions are enriched in neural progenitor cell-like cellular states, while CE regions are enriched for mesenchymal-like states. These NE glioma cells have similar proportions of proliferative and putative glioma stem cells relative to CE regions, without significant differences in % Ki67 staining. Tumor cells in NE regions exhibit upregulation of genes previously associated with lower grade gliomas. Cell-, gene-, and pathway-level analyses of the tumor microenvironment in the NE region reveal relative downregulation of tumor-mediated neovascularization and presence of cell-mediated immune response, but increased glioma-to-non-pathological cellular interactions.\n\nConclusionsThis comprehensive analysis illustrates differing tumor and non-tumor landscapes of CE and NE regions in high-grade gliomas, highlighting the NE region as an area harboring likely initiators of recurrence in a pro-tumor microenvironment and identifying possible targets for future design of NE-specific adjuvant therapy.\n\nKey PointsSignificant proliferating tumor burden exist in non-enhancing regions of glioma; non-enhancing regions have unique tumor and non-tumor expression properties\n\nImportance of StudyStandard of care treatment for glioblastoma relies on visualization of tumor via contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. However, non-enhancing regions harbor tumor cells that should be targets for adjuvant therapy given these regions are not resected in surgery. To begin addressing these infiltrating non-enhancing tumor cells, we thoroughly characterize the tumor and non-tumor microenvironment of non-enhancing regions in high grade gliomas. Understanding the total tumor burden, proliferating tumor ratio, and presence of putative glioma stem cells may help design adjuvant therapies for these unique population of tumor cells. Understanding the non-tumor immune and vascular microenvironment may help target these areas in regards to drug delivery and immunotherapy. Overall, in a disease marked by significant intratumoral heterogeneity, we focus identifying therapeutic strategies for areas not addressed at surgery.",

    "abstract": "Assessment of the genetic similarity between two phenotypes can provide insight into a common genetic aetiology and inform the use of pleiotropy-informed, cross-phenotype analytical methods to identify novel genetic associations. The genetic correlation is a well-known means of quantifying and testing for genetic similarity between traits, but its estimates are subject to comparatively large sampling error. This makes it unsuitable for use in a small-sample context. We discuss the use of a nonparametric test of genetic similarity first introduced by Li et al. for application to GWAS summary statistics. We establish that the null distribution of the test statistic is modelled better by an extreme value distribution than a transformation of the standard exponential distribution as originally recommended by Li and colleagues. We show with simulation studies and real data from GWAS of 18 phenotypes from the UK Biobank that the test is to be preferred for use with small sample sizes, particularly when genetic effects are few and large, outperforming the genetic correlation and another nonparametric statistical test of independence. We find the test suitable for the detection of genetic similarity in the rare disease context.\n\nAuthor summaryThe genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a method used to identify genetic variants which contribute to the risk of developing disease. These genetic variants are frequently shared between conditions, such that the study of the genetic basis of one disease can be informed by knowledge of another, similar disease. This approach can be productive where the disease in question is rare such that a GWAS has less power to associate variants with the disease, but there exist larger GWAS of similar diseases. Existing methods do not measure genetic similarity precisely when patients are few. Here we assess a previously published method of testing for genetic similarity between pairs of diseases using GWAS data, the  GPS test, against three other methods with the use of real and simulated data. We present a new computational procedure for carrying out the test and show that the GPS test is superior to its comparators in identifying genetic similarity when the sample size is small and when the genetic similarity signal is less strong. Use of the test will enable accurate detection of genetic similarity and the study of rarer conditions using data from better-characterised diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLack of trust in artificial intelligence (AI) models in medicine is still the key blockage for the use of AI in clinical decision support systems (CDSS). Although AI models are already performing excellently in systems medicine, their black-box nature entails that patient-specific decisions are incomprehensible for the physician. This is especially true for very complex models such as graph neural networks (GNNs), a common state-of-the-art approach to model biological networks such as protein-protein-interaction graphs (PPIs) to predict clinical outcomes. The aim of explainable AI (XAI) algorithms is to \"explain\" to a human domain expert, which input features, such as genes, influenced a specific recommendation. However, in the clinical domain, it is essential that these explanations lead to some degree of causal understanding by a clinician in the context of a specific application.\n\nResultsWe developed the CLARUS platform, aiming to promote human understanding of GNN predictions by allowing the domain expert to validate and improve the decision-making process. CLARUS enables the visualisation of the patient-specific biological networks used to train and test the GNN model, where nodes and edges correspond to gene products and their interactions, for instance. XAI methods, such as GNNExplainer, compute relevance values for genes and interactions. The CLARUS graph visualisation highlights gene and interaction relevances by color intensity and line thickness, respectively. This enables domain experts to gain deeper insights into the biological network by identifying the most influential sub-graphs and molecular pathways crucial for the decision-making process. More importantly, the expert can interactively alter the patient-specific PPI network based on the acquired understanding and initiate re-prediction or retraining. This interactivity allows to ask manual counterfactual questions and analyse the resulting effects on the GNN prediction.\n\nConclusionTo the best of our knowledge, we present the first interactive XAI platform prototype, CLARUS, that allows not only the evaluation of specific human counterfactual questions based on user-defined alterations of patient PPI networks and a re-prediction of the clinical outcome but also a retraining of the entire GNN after changing the underlying graph structures. The platform is currently hosted by the GWDG on https://rshiny.gwdg.de/apps/clarus/.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive immune system employs an array of receptors designed to respond with high specificity to pathogens or molecular aberrations faced by the host organism. Binding of these receptors to molecular fragments - collectively referred to as antigens - initiates immune responses. These antigenic targets are recognized in their native state on the surfaces of pathogens by antibodies, whereas T cell receptors (TCR) recognize processed antigens as short peptides, presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Recent research has led to a wealth of immune repertoire data that are key to interrogating the nature of these molecular interactions. However, existing tools for the analysis of these large datasets typically focus on molecular sets of a single type, forcing researchers to separately analyze strongly coupled sequences of interacting molecules. Here, we introduce a software package for the integrated analysis of immune repertoire data, capable of identifying distinct biophysical differences in isolated TCR, MHC, peptide, antibody, and antigen sequence data. This integrated analytical approach allows for direct comparisons across immune repertoire subsets and provides a starting point for the identification of key interaction hotspots in complementary receptor-antigen pairs. The software (AIMS - Automated Immune Molecule Separator) is freely available as an open access package in GUI or command-line form.",

Integrating multimodal data from different sequencing technologies, i.e. mosaic data, permits larger-scale investigation with more modalities and can help to better reveal cellular heterogeneity. However, mosaic integration involves major challenges, particularly regarding modality alignment and batch effect removal. Here we present a deep probabilistic framework for the mosaic integration and knowledge transfer (MIDAS) of single-cell multimodal data. MIDAS simultaneously achieves dimensionality reduction, imputation, and batch correction of mosaic data by employing self-supervised modality alignment and information-theoretic latent disentanglement. We demonstrate its superiority to other methods and reliability by evaluating its performance in full trimodal integration and various mosaic tasks. We also constructed a single-cell trimodal atlas of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and tailored transfer learning and reciprocal reference mapping schemes to enable flexible and accurate knowledge transfer from the atlas to new data. Applications in mosaic integration, pseudotime analysis, and cross-tissue knowledge transfer on bone marrow mosaic datasets demonstrate the versatility and superiority of MIDAS.",

    "abstract": "The inescapable link between sensing and movement generates a conflict between producing costly movements for gathering information (\"explore\") versus using previously acquired information to achieve a goal (\"exploit\"). Determining the optimal balance between explore and exploit is a computationally intractable problem, necessitating the use of heuristics. We looked to nature to measure and model the solutions used by organisms. Here we show that the electric fish Eigenmannia virescens uses a salience-dependent mode-switching strategy to solve the explore-exploit conflict during a refuge tracking task. The fish produced distinctive non-Gaussian (i.e., non-normal) distributions of movement velocities characterized by sharp peaks for slower, task-oriented \"exploit\" movements and broad shoulders for faster, \"explore\" movements. The measures of non-normality increased in relation to increased sensory salience. Data from ten phylogenetically diverse organisms, from amoebae to humans, revealed the same distinctive distribution of movement velocities that were also modulated in relation to sensory salience. We propose a state-uncertainty based mode-switching heuristic that (1) reproduces the distinctive velocity distribution, (2) rationalizes modulation by sensory salience, and (3) outperforms the classic persistent excitation approach while using less energy. This mode-switching heuristic provides insights to purposeful exploratory behaviors in organisms as well as a framework for more efficient state estimation and control of robots.",

In epithelial tissues that are patterned by morphogen gradients, the emerging patterns achieve levels of precision that have recently been explained by a simple one-dimensional reaction-diffusion model with kinetic noise. Here, we show that patterning precision is even greater if transverse diffusion effects are at play in such tissues. The positional error, a measure for spatial patterning accuracy, decreases in wider tissues but then saturates beyond a width of about ten cells. This demonstrates that the precision of gradient-based patterning in two- or higher-dimensional systems can be even greater than predicted by 1D models, and further attests to the potential of noisy morphogen gradients for high-precision tissue patterning.",

Specifically, recombinant kinases were added to the cell-extracted proteomes to phosphorylate the substrates in vitro. After trypsin digestion, the phosphopeptides were enriched and subjected to nanoLC/MS/MS analysis to identify their phosphorylation sites on a large scale. By analyzing the obtained phosphorylation sites and their surrounding sequences, phosphorylation motifs were extracted for each kinase-substrate proteome pair. We found that each kinase exhibited the same set of phosphorylation motifs, independently of the substrate pool proteome. Furthermore, the identified motifs were also consistent with those found using a completely randomized peptide library. These results indicate that cell-extracted proteomes can provide kinase phosphorylation motifs with sufficient accuracy, even though their sequences are not completely random, supporting the robustness of phosphorylation motif identification based on phosphoproteome analysis of cell extracts as a substrate pool for a kinase of interest.",

Here we show that GPCR kinase 2 (GRK2) orchestrates this process during endogenous Hh pathway activation in the primary cilium. Upon SMO activation, GRK2 rapidly relocalizes from the ciliary base to the shaft, triggering SMO phosphorylation and PKA-C interaction. Reconstitution studies reveal that GRK2 phosphorylation enables active SMO to bind PKA-C directly. Lastly, the SMO-GRK2-PKA pathway underlies Hh signal transduction in a range of cellular and in vivo models. Thus, GRK2 phosphorylation of ciliary SMO, and the ensuing PKA-C binding and inactivation, are critical initiating events for the intracellular steps in Hh signaling. More broadly, our study suggests an expanded role for GRKs in enabling direct GPCR interactions with diverse intracellular effectors.",

To this end, we present Oryza CLIMtools (https://gramene.org/CLIMtools/oryza_v1.0/), the first resource for pan-genome prediction of climate-associated genetic variants in a crop species. Oryza CLIMtools consists of interactive web-based databases that allow the user to: i) explore the local environments of traditional rice varieties (landraces) in South-Eastern Asia, and; ii) investigate the environment x genome associations for 658 Indica and 283 Japonica rice landrace accessions collected from geo-referenced local environments and included in the 3K Rice Genomes Project. We exemplify the value of these resources, identifying an interplay between flowering time and temperature in the local environment that is facilitated by adaptive natural variation in OsHD2 and disrupted by maladaptive variation in OsSOC1. Prior QTL analysis has suggested the importance of heterotrimeric G proteins in the control of agronomic traits. Accordingly, we analyzed the climate associations of natural variants in the different heterotrimeric G protein subunits. We identified a coordinated role of G proteins in adaptation to the prevailing Potential Evapotranspiration gradient and their regulation of key agronomic traits including plant height and seed and panicle length. We conclude by highlighting the prospect of targeting heterotrimeric G proteins to produce crops that are climate-change-ready.",

    "abstract": "The emerging field of Genome-NLP (Natural Language Processing) aims to analyse biological sequence data using machine learning (ML), offering significant advancements in data-driven diagnostics. Three key challenges exist in Genome-NLP. First, long biomolecular sequences require \"tokenisation\" into smaller subunits, which is non-trivial since many biological \"words\" remain unknown. Second, ML methods are highly nuanced, reducing interoperability and usability. Third, comparing models and reproducing results are difficult due to the large volume and poor quality of biological data.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, we developed the first automated Genome-NLP workflow that integrates feature engineering and ML techniques. The workflow is designed to be species and sequence agnostic. In this workflow: a) We introduce a new transformer-based model for genomes called genomicBERT, which empirically tokenises sequences while retaining biological context. This approach minimises manual preprocessing, reduces vocabulary sizes, and effectively handles out-of-vocabulary \"words\". (b) We enable the comparison of ML model performance even in the absence of raw data.\n\nTo facilitate widespread adoption and collaboration, we have made genomicBERT available as part of the publicly accessible conda package called genomeNLP. We have successfully demonstrated the application of genomeNLP on multiple case studies, showcasing its effectiveness in the field of Genome-NLP.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe provide a comprehensive classification of genomic data tokenisation and representation approaches for ML applications along with their pros and cons.\nC_LIO_LIWe infer k-mers directly from the data and handle out-of-vocabulary words. At the same time, we achieve a significantly reduced vocabulary size compared to the conventional k-mer approach reducing the computational complexity drastically.\nC_LIO_LIOur method is agnostic to species or biomolecule type as it is data-driven.\nC_LIO_LIWe enable comparison of trained model performance without requiring original input data, metadata or hyperparameter settings.\nC_LIO_LIWe present the first publicly available, high-level toolkit that infers the grammar of genomic data directly through artificial neural networks.\nC_LIO_LIPreprocessing, hyperparameter sweeps, cross validations, metrics and interactive visualisations are automated but can be adjusted by the user as needed.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate nearly every physiological process but our understanding of exactly how they function remains incomplete, particularly in the context of viral infection. Target prediction models are built on canonical miRNA interactions with 3untranslated regions (3UTRs) and post-transcriptional gene suppression, leaving a gap in knowledge on other types of targets and capacity for direct interactions with viral genomes. Here we adapt a biochemical method to globally identify targets of human miRNAs in lung cells including scope for direct interactions with Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). We show that RSV binds miR-26, miR-27, and let-7, leading to de-repression of miRNA targets associated with cell cycle regulation and immune signalling. Using our bioinformatics pipeline to determine high confidence targets in the human genome we further discover that pseudogenes which overlap transcriptional regulatory regions are functional miRNA targets. We identify and validate an interaction between miR-27 and a pseudogene-derived lncRNA that regulates transcription of Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1). This work demonstrates that RSV directly interacts with host miRNAs to de-regulate host gene expression and provides biochemical support for the ability of miRNAs to directly regulate gene transcription linked to immune signalling.",

    "abstract": "Adipogenesis is a multi-step process, with epigenetic mechanisms and dynamic 3D chromatin folding thought to play important regulatory roles. However, the kinetics and functional roles of promoter contacts during late-stage adipogenesis are unknown. Here, using multi-omics approaches, we found evidence for promoter switching and widespread 3D rewiring of promoter contacts, as well as changes in the transcriptome and epigenome in late-stage adipogenesis. We identified several clusters of promoter contacts with unique temporal profiles suggesting crucial roles for distal enhancers. By integrating transcriptomics, promoter-capture Hi-C and a siRNA screen of druggable genes, we identified 19 novel regulators of late-stage adipogenesis, over half of which have peptidase or ubiquitin-protein ligase activities. Population-based genetic analyses showed that three of the 19 genes (LAP3, CELA1 and GPR157) are involved in regulation of adiposity in humans. These findings shed new light on the epigenetic regulation of late-stage adipogenesis, advancing our understanding of the mechanisms that underpin the formation of functional adipocytes and identifying potential targets for preventing/treating obesity and related disorders.",

This has contributed to kappa dominance amongst clinical-stage therapeutics. However, the identification of increasing numbers of epitopes preferentially engaged by{lambda} -antibodies shows there is a functional cost to neglecting them as potential lead candidates during discovery campaigns. Here, we update our Therapeutic Antibody Profiler (TAP) tool to use the latest data and machine learning-based structure prediction methods, and apply this new protocol to evaluate developability risk profiles for{kappa} -antibodies and{lambda} -antibodies based on their surface physicochemical properties. We find that{lambda} -antibodies are on average at a higher risk of poor developability -- as an indication, over 40% of single-cell sequenced human{lambda} -antibodies are flagged by TAP for risk-prone patches of surface hydrophobicity (PSH), compared to around 11% of human{kappa} -antibodies. Nonetheless, a substantial proportion of natural{lambda} -antibodies are assigned more moderate risk profiles by TAP and should therefore represent more tractable candidates for therapeutic development. We also analyse the populations of high and low risk antibodies, highlighting opportunities for strategic design that TAP suggests would enrich for more developable{lambda} -based candidates.

    "abstract": "Humans have the ability to craft abstract, temporally extended and hierarchically organized plans. For instance, when considering how to make spaghetti for dinner, we typically concern ourselves with useful \"subgoals\" in the task, such as cutting onions, boiling pasta, and cooking a sauce, rather than particulars such as how many cuts to make to the onion, or exactly which muscles to contract. A core question is how such decomposition of a more abstract task into logical subtasks happens in the first place. Previous research has shown that humans are sensitive to a form of hierarchical statistical learning named \"community structure\". Community structure is a common feature of abstract tasks characterized by a logical ordering of subtasks. This structure can be captured by a model where humans learn predictions of upcoming events multiple steps into the future, discounting predictions of events further away in time. One such model is the \"successor representation\", which has been argued to be useful for hierarchical abstraction. As of yet, no study has convincingly shown that this hierarchical abstraction can be put to use for goal-directed behavior. Here, we investigate whether participants utilize learned community structure to craft hierarchically informed action plans for goal-directed behavior. Participants were asked to search for paintings in a virtual museum, where the paintings were grouped together in \"wings\" representing community structure in the museum. We find that participants choices accord with the hierarchical structure of the museum and that their response times are best predicted by a successor representation. The degree to which the response times reflect the community structure of the museum correlates with several measures of performance, including the ability to craft temporally abstract action plans. These results suggest that successor representation learning subserves hierarchical abstractions relevant for goal-directed behavior.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYHumans have the ability to achieve a diverse range of goals in a highly complex world. Classic theories of decision making focus on simple tasks involving single goals. In the current study, we test a recent theoretical proposal that aims to address the flexibility of human decision making. By learning to predict the upcoming events, humans can acquire a  model of the world which they can then leverage to plan their behavior. However, given the complexity of the world, planning directly over all possible events can be overwhelming. We show that, by leveraging this predictive model, humans group similar events together into simpler \"hierarchical\" representations, which makes planning over these hierarchical representations markedly more efficient. Interestingly, humans seem to learn and remember both the complex predictive model and the simplified hierarchical model, using them for distinct purposes.",

    "abstract": "A protein sequence encodes its energy landscape - all the accessible conformations, energetics, and dynamics. The evolutionary relationship between sequence and landscape can be probed phylogenetically by compiling a multiple sequence alignment of homologous sequences and generating common ancestors via Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction or a consensus protein containing the most common amino acid at each position. Both ancestral and consensus proteins are often more stable than their extant homologs - questioning the differences and suggesting that both approaches serve as general methods to engineer thermostability. We used the Ribonuclease H family to compare these approaches and evaluate how the evolutionary relationship of the input sequences affects the properties of the resulting consensus protein. While the overall consensus protein is structured and active, it neither shows properties of a well-folded protein nor has enhanced stability. In contrast, the consensus protein derived from a phylogenetically-restricted region is significantly more stable and cooperatively folded, suggesting that cooperativity may be encoded by different mechanisms in separate clades and lost when too many diverse clades are combined to generate a consensus protein. To explore this, we compared pairwise covariance scores using a Potts formalism as well as higher-order couplings using singular value decomposition (SVD). We find the SVD coordinates of a stable consensus sequence are close to coordinates of the analogous ancestor sequence and its descendants, whereas the unstable consensus sequences are outliers in SVD space.",

Recent investigation of visual processes has led to important insights into the nature of the neural representations of familiarity for human faces. Still, little is known about how familiarity affects the neural dynamics of non-face stimulus processing. Here we report the results of an EEG study, examining the representational dynamics of personally familiar scenes. Participants viewed highly variable images of their own apartments and unfamiliar ones, as well as personally familiar and unfamiliar faces. Multivariate pattern analyses were used to examine the time course of differential processing of familiar and unfamiliar stimuli. Time-resolved classification revealed that familiarity is decodable from the EEG data similarly for scenes and faces. The temporal dynamics showed delayed onsets and peaks for scenes as compared to faces. Familiarity information, starting at 200 ms, generalized across stimulus categories and led to a robust familiarity effect. In addition, familiarity enhanced category representations in early (250 - 300 ms) and later (>400 ms) processing stages. Our results extend previous face familiarity results to another stimulus category and suggest that familiarity as a construct can be understood as a general, stimulus-independent processing step during recognition.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWhether a face or scene is familiar can be decoded from the EEG signal with very similar temporal dynamics, starting at 200 ms and peaking around 400 ms after stimulus onset.\nC_LIO_LIThe neural dynamics of this familiarity information generalizes across stimulus categories.\nC_LIO_LIFamiliarity modulates stimulus category representations from 200 ms after stimulus onset, indicating deeper processing of familiar as compared to unfamiliar stimuli already during early processing stages.\nC_LI",

Immunotoxicity data for ENM safety assessment are collected in dose-response format. At different states, multiparametric readouts for cytotoxicity, and innate immunity are conducted in a combinatorial method, avoiding ENM-induced bias by endotoxin contamination. Integrating this high-dimensional data, allows (i) holistic safety assessment of immunotoxicity effects caused by ENM, classifying safe and toxic ENM phenotypes, and (ii) to deconvolve mode of action of the ENM effect on the PBMCs. As added value the data obtained can be used to troubleshoot ENM or for a safe-by-design approach in product development.",

We show here that the translocating pathobiont Enterococcus gallinarum induces human IFN{gamma}+ Th17 differentiation and IgG3 subclass switch of anti-E. gallinarum RNA and correlating anti-human RNA autoantibody responses in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and autoimmune hepatitis. Human Th17 induction by E. gallinarum is cell-contact dependent and involves TLR8-mediated human monocyte activation. In murine gnotobiotic lupus models, E. gallinarum translocation triggers IgG3 anti-RNA autoantibody titers that correlate with renal autoimmune pathophysiology and with disease activity in patients. Overall, we define cellular mechanisms of how a translocating pathobiont induces human T- and B-cell-dependent autoimmune responses, providing a framework for developing host- and microbiota-derived biomarkers and targeted therapies in extraintestinal autoimmune diseases.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryTranslocating pathobiont Enterococcus gallinarum promotes human Th17 and IgG3 autoantibody responses linked to disease activity in autoimmune patients.",

    "abstract": "Thermal soaring conditions above the sea have long been assumed absent or too weak for terrestrial migrating birds, forcing large obligate soarers to take long detours and avoid sea crossing, and facultative soarers to cross exclusively by costly flapping flight. Thus, while atmospheric convection does develop at sea and is utilized by some seabirds, it has been largely ignored in avian migration research. Here we provide direct evidence for routine thermal soaring over open sea in the common crane, the heaviest facultative soarer known among terrestrial migrating birds. Using high-resolution biologging from 44 cranes tracked across their transcontinental migration over 4 years, we show that soaring characteristics and performance were no different over sea than over land in mid-latitudes. Sea-soaring occurred predominantly in autumn when large water-air temperature difference followed mid-latitude cyclones. Our findings challenge a fundamental paradigm in avian migration research and suggest that large soaring migrants avoid sea crossing not due to absence or weakness of thermals but due to their uncertainty and the costs of prolonged flapping. Marine cold air outbreaks, imperative to the global energy budget and climate system, may also be important for bird migration, calling for more multidisciplinary research across biological and atmospheric sciences.",

    "abstract": "MKT1, a pleiotropic stress response gene identified by several quantitative trait studies, regulates HO endonuclease via the Pbp1-Pab1 complex post-transcriptionally. In addition, MKT1A89G polymorphism was identified to contribute differentially to stress resistance. MKT189G, as a causal variant, determined growth advantage in multiple environments and was hypothesised to regulate differential expression during stress conditions. RNA-binding protein Puf3 modulates a set of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial transcripts whose expression was found to be affected by MKT1 alleles. This study attempts to relate the MKT1 allele-derived growth advantage with the stability of Puf3 targets during stress and elucidate the roles of Pbp1 and Puf3 in this mechanism. We compared the mRNA decay kinetics of a set of Puf3 targets in multiple environments to understand the allele-specific regulation by MKT1. Our results indicate that variation in post-transcriptional regulation between MKT1 alleles causes this differential expression of Puf3 targets in a stress-specific manner. Additionally, MKT1 allelic interactions with Pbp1 and Puf3 were necessary for stabilising Puf3 targets, and this regulation was specific to the MKT189G allele. Phenotypic analysis of these stress-specific Puf3 targets - COX17, IVY1, and RDL2 showed that they selectively affect growth in MKT189G background in oxidative stress.\n\nTAKE AWAYMKT1 alleles vary stress responses by post-transcriptional modulation of Puf3 targets.\n\nBoth PBP1 and PUF3 contribute to the regulation of Puf3 target stability under stress.\n\nIndividual genes within the Puf3 targets have stress-specific roles in MKT1-mediated stress responses.",

OMERO is a popular open-source client-server application that provides a unified interface for managing and working with bioimages and their associated measurements and metadata. Integrating OMERO into analysis pipelines, such as those developed around the scientific Python ecosystem, will thus be a common pattern across the field of bioimaging. While OMERO has a powerful Python API, it provides minimal abstraction from the underlying OMERO object model and associated methods, which represent more complexity than most users are interested in for the context of an analysis script. We introduce ezomero, which was designed to provide a convenience layer on top of existing OMERO APIs and return data types that are either Python primitive or commonly used in scientific Python. Ezomero has minimal dependencies in addition to the OMERO Python library itself and is installable directly from PyPI.

Our method, saseR, is several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art methods and dramatically outperforms these in terms of sensitivity and specificity for aberrant splicing, while being on par with these inferring differential usage and aberrant expression.

    "abstract": "Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are essential for vision perception. In glaucoma and other optic neuropathies, RGCs and their optic axons undergo degenerative change and cell death; this can result in irreversible vision loss. Here we developed a rapid protocol for directly inducing RGC differentiation from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by the overexpression of ATOH7, BRN3B and SOX4. The hiPSC-derived RGC-like cells (iRGCs) show robust expression of various RGC-specific markers by whole transcriptome profiling. A functional assessment was also carried out and this demonstrated that these iRGCs display stimulus-induced neuronal activity, as well as spontaneous neuronal activity. Ethambutol (EMB), an effective first-line anti-tuberculosis agent, is known to cause serious visual impairment and irreversible vision loss due to the RGC degeneration in a significant number of treated patients. Using our iRGCs, EMB was found to induce significant dose-dependent and time-dependent increases in cell death and neurite degeneration. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression levels of p62 and LC3-II were upregulated, and further investigations revealed that EMB caused a blockade of lysosome-autophagosome fusion; this indicates that impairment of autophagic flux is one of the adverse effects of that EMB has on iRGCs. In addition, EMB was found to elevate intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels increasing apoptotic cell death. This could be partially rescued by the co-treatment with the ROS scavenger NAC. Taken together, our findings suggest that this iRGC model, which achieves both high yield and high purity, is suitable for investigating optic neuropathies, as well as being useful when searching for potential drugs for therapeutic treatment and/or disease prevention.",

    "abstract": "Asymmetric transport of cargo across axonal branches is a field of active research. Mechanisms contributing to preferential cargo transport along specific branches in vivo in wild type neurons are poorly understood. We find that anterograde synaptic vesicles preferentially enter the synaptic branch or pause at the branch point in C. elegans PLM neurons. The anterograde motor UNC-104/KIF1A regulates this vesicle behaviour at the branch point. Reduced levels of functional UNC-104 cause vesicles to predominantly pause at the branch point and lose their preference for turning into the synaptic branch. SAM- 4/Myrlysin, which aids in recruitment/activation of UNC-104 on synaptic vesicles, regulates vesicle behaviour at the branch point similar to UNC-104. Increasing the levels of UNC-104 increases the preference of vesicles to go straight towards the asynaptic end. This suggests that the neuron optimises UNC-104 levels on the cargo surface to maximise the fraction of vesicles entering the branch and minimise the fraction going to the asynaptic end.",

    "abstract": "Tissue interactions are essential to guide organogenesis. The development of hair follicles is regulated by inductive signalling between the embryonic surface epithelium and the adjacent mesenchyme. Previous studies have established that the mesenchymal component of the hair follicle, the dermal papilla and its precursor dermal condensate, has the capacity for de novo hair follicle induction. However, studies prior to dermal condensate formation have been inconclusive, and therefore the source and the identity of the primary inductive signal have remained unknown. Here, we performed epithelial-mesenchymal tissue recombination experiments using hair-forming back skin and glabrous plantar skin from mouse embryos to unveil that the back skin mesenchyme is inductive even prior to dermal condensate formation. Moreover, the naive, unpatterned mesenchyme was sufficient to trigger hair follicle formation even in the oral epithelium. Considering the recognized role of Wnt signalling and Bmp activity inhibition in initiation of hair follicle development, we explored the hair-inductive ability of the Wnt agonist R-spondin-1 and a Bmp receptor inhibitor in embryonic skin explants. Although R-spondin-1 instigated precocious placode-specific transcriptional responses, it alone or in combination with the Bmp receptor inhibitor was insufficient for hair follicle induction. Our findings pave the way for identifying the hair follicle-inducing cue.",

    "abstract": "During homeostasis, a critical balance is maintained between myeloid-like progenitors and their differentiated progeny, which function to mitigate stress and innate immune challenges. The molecular mechanisms that help achieve this balance are not fully understood. Using genetic dissection in Drosophila, we show that a Wnt6/EGFR-signaling network simultaneously controls progenitor growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Unlike G1-quiescence of stem cells, hematopoietic progenitors are blocked in the G2 phase by a {beta}-catenin-independent Wnt6 pathway that restricts Cdc25 nuclear entry and promotes cell growth. Canonical {beta}-catenin-dependent Wnt6 signaling is spatially confined to mature progenitors through localized activation of the tyrosine-kinases EGFR and Abl, which promote nuclear entry of {beta}-catenin and facilitate exit from G2. This strategy combines transcription-dependent and - independent forms of both Wnt6 and EGFR pathways to create a direct link between cell-cycle control and differentiation. This unique combinatorial strategy employing conserved components may underlie homeostatic balance and stress response in mammalian hematopoiesis.",

This study aimed to determine when daily rhythms begin in the fetus and synchronize to the mother. We developed methods to monitor the expression of fetal PERIOD2 (PER2), a core circadian clock protein, in mice longitudinally from embryonic day (E)8.5 to E17.5 through in utero bioluminescence imaging. We found that embryonic PER2 expression increased rapidly throughout pregnancy and exhibited day-night rhythms from the start of our recordings at E8.5. The daily peak time of PER2 varied between pregnancies until it reliably peaked at night and synchronized to the mother starting around E15.5. Loss of fetal circadian rhythms associated with pregnancies that ultimately failed. Because maternal glucocorticoids have been implicated in fetal development and synchronizing circadian tissues, we tested their sufficiency to shift fetal daily rhythms in utero. Daily glucocorticoids injections over five days of late pregnancy advanced fetal PER2 rhythms in utero and blocking glucocorticoid signaling in vitro reduced PER2 synchrony between the maternal and fetal placenta by [~]40%. We conclude that fetal daily rhythms arise early in pregnancy and then synchronize with the maternal rhythm prior to birth depending, in part, on glucocorticoid signaling.",

    "abstract": "While physiologic stress has long been known to impair mammalian reproductive capacity through hormonal dysregulation, mounting evidence now suggests that stress experienced prior to or during gestation may also negatively impact the health of future offspring. Rodent models of gestational physiologic stress can induce neurologic and behavioral phenotypes that persist for up to three generations, suggesting that stress signals can induce lasting epigenetic changes in the germline. Treatment with glucocorticoid stress hormones is sufficient to recapitulate the transgenerational phenotypes seen in physiologic stress models. These hormones are known to bind and activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-inducible transcription factor, thus implicating GR-mediated signaling as a potential contributor to the transgenerational inheritance of stress-induced phenotypes. Here we demonstrate dynamic spatiotemporal regulation of GR expression in the mouse germline, showing expression in the fetal oocyte as well as the perinatal and adult spermatogonia. Functionally, we find that fetal oocytes are intrinsically buffered against changes in GR signaling, as neither genetic deletion of GR nor GR agonism with dexamethasone altered the transcriptional landscape or the progression of fetal oocytes through meiosis. In contrast, our studies revealed that the male germline is susceptible to glucocorticoid-mediated signaling, specifically by regulating RNA splicing within the spermatogonia, although this does not abrogate fertility. Together, our work suggests a sexually dimorphic function for GR in the germline, and represents an important step towards understanding the mechanisms by which stress can modulate the transmission of genetic information through the germline.",

REN also drives expression in uninjured cardiac tissue surrounding valves viewed from the reporter and phenotypes arising from a REN-deletion mutant. Activity of the REN reporter peaks just before and during the peak of regeneration. During this time, REN activity in myocardium adjacent to the valves goes away. The expression dynamics of the REN reporter, motifs embedded within REN and the fact that REN activates not just during injury but generally during cardiomyocyte proliferation all suggest that REN is an enhancer promoting regeneration. Unexpectedly, deletion of REN results in improved cardiomyocyte proliferation suggesting activation of anti-proliferative factors is part of the normal course of regeneration. REN is also active in the newly formed regenerated muscle during the conclusion of regeneration.

    "abstract": "CK1 kinases participate in many signaling pathways; how these enzymes are regulated is therefore of significant biological consequence. CK1s autophosphorylate their C-terminal non-catalytic tails, and eliminating these modifications increases substrate phosphorylation in vitro, suggesting that the autophosphorylated C-termini act as inhibitory pseudosubstrates. To test this prediction, we comprehensively identified the autophosphorylation sites on Schizosaccharomyces pombe Hhp1 and human CK1{varepsilon}. Peptides corresponding to the C-termini interacted with the kinase domains only when phosphorylated, and phosphoablating mutations increased Hhp1 and CK1{varepsilon} activity towards substrates. Interestingly, substrates competitively inhibited binding of the autophosphorylated tails to the substrate binding grooves. The presence or absence of tail autophosphorylation influenced the catalytic efficiency with which CK1s targeted different substrates, indicating that tails contribute to substrate specificity. Combining this mechanism with autophosphorylation of the T220 site in the catalytic domain, we propose a displacement specificity model to describe how autophosphorylation regulates substrate specificity for the CK1 family.",

    "abstract": "In the phototrophic alphaproteobacteria, photosynthesis is performed by pigment-protein complexes, including the light-harvesting complexes known as LH1 and LH2. The photosystem also encompasses carotenoids to assist in well-functioning of photosynthesis. Most photosynthetic bacteria are exposed to various abiotic stresses, and here, the Rhodobacter (R.) alkalitolerans were extracted from the alkaline pond. We report the comparative study of the photosynthetic apparatus of R. alkalitolerans in various light intensities in relation to this bacteriums high pH tolerance ability. We found that as the light intensity increased, the stability of photosystem complexes decreased in normal pH (npH pH 6.8{+/-}0.05) conditions, whereas in high pH (hpH pH 8.6{+/-}0.05) acclimation was observed to high light. The content of bacteriochlorophyll a, absorbance spectra, and circular dichroism data shows that the integrity of photosystem complexes is less affected in hpH compared to npH conditions. LP-BN of photosystem complexes also shows that LH2 is more affected in npH than hpH, whereas RC-LH1 monomer or dimer has shown interplay between monomer and dimer in hpH although the dimer and monomer both increased in npH. The sucrose density gradient of {beta}-DM solubilized intracytoplasmic membranes, further evidences the pattern of monomer-dimer conversion. Additionally, thin layer chromatographic separation of isolated membrane lipids shows that phosphatidylcholine (PC) levels have increased in hpH conditions which further confirms the integrity of photosystem complexes in hpH conditions. Moreover, qPCR data showed that the subunit -c of ATPase levels was overexpressed in hpH. Consequently, the P515 measurement shows that more ATP production is required in hpH, which dissipates the protons from the chromatophore lumen. This could be the reason the photosystem protein complex destabilized due to more lumen acidification. To maintain homeostasis in hpH, the antiporter NhaD expressed more than in the npH condition.\n\nIMPORTANCER. alkalitolerans is an alkaline tolerant species discovered from an alkaline pond in Gujrat India. Being a photoautotrophic photosynthetic organism, it serves as a good model organism to study the photosynthetic apparatus among phototrophic alphaproteobacteria. In nature organisms not only tackle a single abiotic stress but many including temperature, light, salinity, and many other abiotic stresses. Here we investigate how two different abiotic factors light and alkaline conditions modulate the growth and photosynthetic apparatus in a phototrophic alphaproteobacterium, R. alkalitolerans. Our results of this study will give leads in developing alkali-tolerant algae and higher plants.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent progress, the complex roles played by the extracellular matrix in development and disease are still far from being fully understood. Here, we took advantage of the zebrafish sly mutation which affects Laminin {gamma}1, a major component of basement membranes, to explore its role in the development of the olfactory system. Following a detailed characterisation of Laminin distribution in the developing olfactory circuit, we analysed basement membrane integrity, olfactory placode and brain morphogenesis, and olfactory axon development in sly mutants, using a combination of immunochemistry, electron microscopy and quantitative live imaging of cell movements and axon behaviours. Our results point to an original and dual contribution of Laminin {gamma}1-dependent basement membranes in organising the border between the olfactory placode and the adjacent brain: they maintain placode shape and position in the face of major brain morphogenetic movements, they establish a robust physical barrier between the two tissues while at the same time allowing the local entry of the sensory axons into the brain and their navigation towards the olfactory bulb. This work thus identifies key roles of Laminin {gamma}1-dependent basement membranes in neuronal tissue morphogenesis and axon development in vivo.",

    "abstract": "While dysfunction and death of light-detecting photoreceptor cells underlie most inherited retinal dystrophies, knowledge of the species-specific details of human rod and cone photoreceptor cell development remains limited. Here, we generate retinal organoids using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from a patient with genetic photoreceptor disease due to mutations in NR2E3, an isogenic control, and an unrelated control. Organoids were sampled using single-cell RNA sequencing across the developmental window encompassing photoreceptor specification, emergence, and maturation, up to 260 days of in vitro differentiation. Using single-cell transcriptomics data, we reconstruct the rod photoreceptor developmental lineage and identify a branchpoint in development unique to the disease state that gives rise to a divergent rod photoreceptor cell population. We show that the rod-specific transcription factor NR2E3 is required for the proper expression of genes involved in phototransduction, including expression of the light-sensitive protein rhodopsin, which is absent in divergent rods. NR2E3-null rods additionally misexpress several cone-specific phototransduction genes at both the transcript and protein level. Using joint multimodal single-cell sequencing on late-stage retinal organoids, we further identify specific putative regulatory sites where rod-specific factors act to steer rod and cone photoreceptor cell development. Importantly, these findings are strikingly different than those observed in rodent models of disease. Together, these data provide a roadmap of human photoreceptor development and leverage patient iPSCs to define the specific roles of rod transcription factors in photoreceptor cell emergence and maturation.",

The pathophysiology of excess adiposity and its accompanying immunometabolic dysregulation are associated with impaired intestinal barrier function in both non-pregnant and pregnant contexts. Using a mouse model, we investigated effects of diet-induced excess adiposity on maternal physiological adaptations during lactation. We report that in lactation, excess adiposity altered maternal intestinal morphology, influenced local immune cell composition and phenotype, increased intestinal permeability, and altered whole-body glucose metabolism as well as peripheral inflammation and immune cell composition. Many of these effects persisted two months post-lactation in mice with excess adiposity. Our findings have important implications for the development of interventions for periconceptual/perinatal excess adiposity and emphasize that further studies are needed to better understand effects of excess adiposity on maternal postpartum health.",

    "abstract": "Plant cell growth depends on turgor pressure, the cell hydrodynamic pressure, which drives expansion of the extracellular matrix (the cell wall). Turgor pressure regulation depends on several physical, chemical and biological factors, including: vacuolar invertases, which modulate osmotic pressure of the cell, aquaporins, which determine the permeability of the plasma membrane, cell wall remodeling factors, which determine cell wall extensibility (inverse of effective viscosity), and plasmodesmata, which are membrane-lined channels that allow free movement of water and solutes between cytoplasms of neighbouring cells, like gap junctions in animals. Plasmodesmata permeability varies during plant development and experimental studies have correlated changes in the permeability of plasmodesmal channels to turgor pressure variations. Here we study the role of plasmodesmal permeability in cotton fiber growth, a type of cell that increase in length by at least 3 orders of magnitude in a few weeks. We incorporated plasmodesma-dependent movement of water and solutes into a classical model of plant cell expansion. We performed a sensitivity analysis to changes in values of model parameters and found that plasmodesmal permeability is among the most important factors for building up turgor pressure and expanding cotton fibers. Moreover, we found that non-monotonic behaviors of turgor pressure that have been reported previously in cotton fibers cannot be recovered without accounting for dynamic changes of the parameters used in the model. Altogether, our results suggest an important role for plasmodesmal permeability in the regulation of turgor pressure.\n\nSignificance StatementThe cotton fiber is among the plant cells with the highest growth rates. In cultivars, a single fiber cell generally reaches a few centimeters in length. How such size is achieved is still poorly understood. In order to tackle this question, we built a comprehensive mathematical model of fiber elongation, considering cell mechanics and water entry into the cell. Model predictions agree with experimental observations, provided that we take into account active opening and closure of plasmodesmata, the sub-micrometric channels that connect the fiber with neighboring cells. Because cotton fiber length is a key factor for yarn quality, our work may help understanding the mechanisms behind an important agronomic trait.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila lymph gland houses blood progenitors that give rise to myeloid-like blood cells. Initially, blood progenitors proliferate, but later become quiescent to maintain multipotency before differentiation. Despite the identification of various factors involved in multipotency maintenance, the cellular mechanism regulating blood progenitor quiescence remains elusive. Here, we reveal the expression of nitric oxide synthase in blood progenitors, generating nitric oxide for post-translational S-nitrosylation of protein cysteine residues. S-nitrosylation activates the Ire1-Xbp1-mediated unfolded protein response, leading to G2 cell cycle arrest. Specifically, we identify the epidermal growth factor receptor as a target of S-nitrosylation, resulting in its retention within the endoplasmic reticulum and blockade of its receptor function. Collectively, our findings highlight developmentally programmed S-nitrosylation as a critical mechanism that induces protein quality control in blood progenitors, maintaining their undifferentiated state by inhibiting cell cycle progression and rendering them unresponsive to paracrine factors.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveCantu Syndrome (CS), a multisystem disease with a complex cardiovascular phenotype, is caused by GoF variants in the Kir6.1/SUR2 subunits of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, and is characterized by low systemic vascular resistance, as well as tortuous, dilated vessels, and decreased pulse-wave velocity. Thus, CS vascular dysfunction is multifactorial, with distinct hypomyotonic and hyperelastic components. To dissect whether such complexities arise cell-autonomously within vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), or as secondary responses to the pathophysiological milieu, we assessed electrical properties and gene expression in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived VSMCs (hiPSC-VSMCs), differentiated from control and CS patient-derived hiPSCs, and in native mouse control and CS VSMCs.\n\nApproach and ResultsWhole-cell voltage-clamp of isolated aortic and mesenteric VSMCs isolated from wild type (WT) and Kir6.1[V65M] (CS) mice revealed no difference in voltage-gated K+ (Kv) or Ca2+ currents. Kv and Ca2+ currents were also not different between validated hiPSC-VSMCs differentiated from control and CS patient-derived hiPSCs. Pinacidil-sensitive KATP currents in control hiPSC-VSMCs were consistent with those in WT mouse VSMCs, and were considerably larger in CS hiPSC-VSMCs. Consistent with lack of any compensatory modulation of other currents, this resulted in membrane hyperpolarization, explaining the hypomyotonic basis of CS vasculopathy. Increased compliance and dilation in isolated CS mouse aortae, was associated with increased elastin mRNA expression. This was consistent with higher levels of elastin mRNA in CS hiPSC-VSMCs, suggesting that the hyperelastic component of CS vasculopathy is a cell-autonomous consequence of vascular KATP GoF.\n\nConclusionsThe results show that hiPSC-VSMCs reiterate expression of the same major ion currents as primary VSMCs, validating the use of these cells to study vascular disease. The results further indicate that both the hypomyotonic and hyperelastic components of CS vasculopathy are cell-autonomous phenomena driven by KATP overactivity within VSMCs.",

Hypersialylation can, for example, enhance immune evasion via interaction with sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) receptors on tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Here, we tested the role of sialic acid on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and their interaction with Siglec receptors. We found that MDSCs derived from the blood of lung cancer patients and tumor-bearing mice strongly express inhibitory Siglec receptors. In murine cancer models of emergency myelopoiesis, Siglec-E knockout on myeloid cells resulted in prolonged survival and increased infiltration of activated T cells. Targeting suppressive myeloid cells by blocking Siglec receptors or desialylation led to strong reduction of their suppressive potential. We further identified CCL2 as mediator involved in T cell suppression upon interaction of sialoglycans and Siglec receptors on MDSCs. Our results provide mechanistic insights how sialylated glycans inhibit anti-cancer immunity by facilitating CCL2 expression.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=142 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/547025v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e7664forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1edd220org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7e630dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@198ff40_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

One of the A2AR/A2BR dual antagonist, AB928, has progressed to phase II clinic trial for the treatment of rectal cancer. However, the precise mechanism underlying its dual-antagonistic properties remains elusive. Herein, we report crystal structures of A2AR in complex with AB928 and a selective A2AR antagonist, 2-118. The structures reveal a common binding mode on A2AR, wherein the ligands establish extensive interactions with residues from both the orthosteric pocket and the secondary pocket. Conversely, the cAMP assay together with molecular dynamics simulations conducted on both A2AR and A2BR indicate that the ligands adopt distinct binding modes on A2BR. Detailed analysis of their chemical structures suggests that AB928 can readily adapt to the A2BR pocket, while 2-118 cannot due to its intrinsic differences. This disparity potentially accounts for their divergent inhibitory efficacies between A2BR and A2AR. The findings from this study can serve as valuable structural templates for future development of selective or dual inhibitors targeting A2AR/A2BR in the context of cancer therapy.",

We employed ICEBERG to map the full set of H3K4me3-marked regulatory regions and {beta}-catenin targets in human colorectal cancer cells. The ICE-BERG datasets allow benchmarking of individual replicates, comparison of the performance of peak calling and replication approaches and expose the arbitrary nature of other strategies to identify reproducible peaks. Instead of a static view of genomic targets, ICEBERG established a spectrum of detection probabilities across the genome for a given factor, underlying the intrinsic dynamicity of its mechanism of action, and permitting to distinguish frequent from rare regulation events. Finally, ICEBERG discovered instances, undetectable with other approaches, that might underlie novel mechanisms of colorectal cancer progression.",

Isolation during critical periods of maturation has been shown to impact behavior, gene expression, and brain development in vertebrate and invertebrate clades, yet remarkable resilience to social deprivation, senescence, and loss of sensory input have been demonstrated in some ant species. We reared workers of Camponotus floridanus under conditions of social isolation for increasing time periods up to 45 days and evaluated their behavioral performance, quantified brain development and biogenic amine levels, and compared results of isolated workers with control workers that had natural social contact during development. We found that brood care and foraging performance by isolated workers were unaffected by a lack of social contact. Antennal lobe volume loss occurred in ants experiencing longer isolation periods, while the size of the mushroom bodies, which function in higher-order sensory processing, increased over time after eclosion and were not different from mature controls. Titers of the neuromodulators serotonin, dopamine, and octopamine remained stable in isolated workers. Our results indicate that workers of C. floridanus are largely robust to the deprivation of social contact early in life.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression has great potential to be used as a clinical diagnostic tool. Researchers have discovered a wealth of patterns in gene expression that are predictive of a wide range of conditions, from liver disease to infectious disease, oncological relapse risk to stratifying autoimmune patients. Despite the progress in identifying these gene expression signatures, clinical translation has been hampered by a lack of purpose-built, readily deployable testing platforms. Deploying these tests to the clinic has relied on expensive, specialized machines, like sequencers, or laborious PCR protocols that require running a dozen or more reactions in parallel. We have developed Competitive Amplification Networks (CANs) to enable analysis of an entire gene expression signature in a single PCR reaction. CANs consist of natural and synthetic amplicons that compete for shared primers during amplification, forming a reaction network that leverages the molecular machinery of PCR. These reaction components are tuned such that the final fluorescent signal from the assay is exactly calibrated to the conclusion of a statistical model. In essence, the reaction acts as a biological computer, simultaneously detecting the RNA targets, interpreting their level in the context of the gene expression signature, and aggregating their contributions to the final diagnosis. We demonstrate the clinical validity of this technique by designing a CAN around a gene expression signature for discriminating between fevers of viral origin and bacterial origin. When tested against twenty patient blood samples, our assay achieved perfect diagnostic agreement with the gold-standard approach of measuring each gene independently. At the same time, the CAN assay was faster and easier to use. Crucially, CAN assays are compatible with existing qPCR instruments and workflows. CANs hold the potential to enable rapid deployment and massive scalability of gene expression analysis to clinical laboratories around the world, in highly developed and low-resourcew settings alike.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=172 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/546934v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a20829org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c5c1b6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@130b1dforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1edae3c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Formaldehyde is a key metabolite in natural and synthetic one-carbon metabolism as well as an important environmental toxin with high toxicity at low concentrations. To engineer efficient formaldehyde producing enzymes and to detect formaldehyde in industrial or environmental samples, it is important to establish highly sensitive, easy to use and affordable formaldehyde detection methods. Here, we transformed the workhorse bacterium Escherichia coli into biosensors that can detect a broad range of formaldehyde concentrations. Based on natural and promiscuous formaldehyde assimilation enzymes, we designed and engineered three different E. coli strains that depend on formaldehyde assimilation for cellular growth. After in depth characterization of these biosensors, we show that the formaldehyde sensitivity can be improved through adaptive laboratory evolution or modification of metabolic branch points. The metabolic engineering strategy presented in this work allowed the creation of E. coli biosensors that can detect formaldehyde in a concentration range from [~]30 M to [~]13 mM. Using the most sensitive strain, we benchmarked the in vivo activities of different, widely used NAD-dependent methanol dehydrogenases, the rate-limiting enzyme in synthetic methylotrophy. We also show that the strains can grow upon external addition of formaldehyde indicating their potential use for applications beyond enzyme engineering. The formaldehyde biosensors developed in this study are fully genomic and can be used as plug and play devices for screening large enzyme libraries. Thus, they have the potential to greatly advance enzyme engineering and might even be used for environmental monitoring or analysis of industrial probes.\n\nHighlights- Conversion of E. coli into three different formaldehyde growth biosensors\n- Biosensors are fully genomic and grow robustly when formaldehyde is present\n- Biosensors can detect formaldehyde concentrations ranging from [~]30 M to [~]13 mM\n- Benchmarking of biotechnological relevant methanol dehydrogenases reveals potential of biosensors for enzyme engineering\n- Biosensors grow upon direct addition of formaldehyde indicating potential use in environmental or industrial settings",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBinding kinetics has become a popular discipline in pharmacology. Yet, it was recommended a decade ago to look on ligand-target binding in terms of fluxes instead of rate constants. Like product formation in enzymology, these binding fluxes stand for the rate/velocity by which the target converts form one state into another. Several thereon-based approaches can be used for studying the functioning binding mechanisms.\n\nObjectivesAlthough the relative contribution/importance of the induced fit and conformational selection binding pathways within a thermodynamic cycle is still hotly debated, only a single flux-based approach is customarily addressed for such calculations. There is a need to better understand the relevance of this peculiar approach.\n\nMethodsThe present findings relied on differential equation-based simulations, using the provided forward- and reverse rate constants for four reported cases as input.\n\nResultsBoth pathways may act in unison and even in tandem rather than being mutually exclusive. Also, calculating their relative contribution by distinct flux-based approaches may yield different outcomes for some of the cases under pre-equilibrium as well as equilibrium conditions. Additional flux-based approaches offer a rationale for the occurrence of those disparities.\n\nConclusionsThe interplay between the induced fit- and conformational selection pathways is even more intricate than hitherto expected. It may me preferable to quantitate their relative contribution in terms of target occupancies instead of binding fluxes when genuine equilibrium can be reached.\n\nPerspectivesCompared to the often-used elaborate algebraic equations, combining different binding flux-based approaches may offer better intuitive and visual insight into the functioning of complex binding mechanisms. More attention should also be paid to physiologically more relevant non-equilibrium situations.",

    "abstract": "This research article quantitatively investigates neuro-microvascular network remodeling dynamics following stroke using a novel in vivo two-photon angiography (cubic millimeter volume, weekly snapshots) and high throughput (thousands of connected capillaries) vascular vectorization method. The results suggest distinct temporal patterns of cere-brovascular plasticity, with acute remodeling peaking at one week post-stroke. The network architecture then gradually stabilizes, returning to a new steady state after four weeks. These findings align with previous literature on neuronal plasticity, highlighting the correlation between neuronal and neurovascular remodeling. Quantitative analysis of neurovascular networks using length- and strand-based statistical measures reveals intri-cate changes in network anatomy and topology. The distance and strand-length statistics show significant alterations, with a peak of plasticity observed at one week post-stroke, followed by a gradual return to baseline. The orientation statistic plasticity peaks at two weeks, gradually approaching the (conserved across subjects) stroke signature. The underlying mechanism of the vascular response (angiogenesis vs. tissue deformation), however, is yet unelucidated, requiring network registration advancements. Overall, the combination of two-photon angiography, vectorization, reconstruction/visualization, and statistical analysis enables both qualitative and quantitative assessments of neu-rovascular remodeling dynamics, demonstrating an impactful method for investigating neuro-microvascular network disorders and the therapeutic modes of action thereof. Understanding the timing and nature of neurovascular remodeling allows for optimized interventions, including personalized medicine for stroke rehabilitation. Additionally, the evaluation of pharmaceutical interventions using these tools may facilitate targeted drug development. Furthermore, neurovascular coupling dynamics have implications for neurodegenerative diseases, brain aging, and the field of brain-computer interfaces.",

While these approaches have concentrated on functional states defined as local EEG characteristics, it is acknowledged that the brain exhibits an intrinsic long-range dynamic organization in brain networks. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that EEG-derived long-range resting-state connectivity of the primary motor cortex (M1) in the pre-stimulation period is largely congruent with the motor network (MN) and that the state of this network modulates the responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of M1.\n\nOne thousand suprathreshold TMS pulses were delivered to left M1 in 8 subjects at rest, while simultaneously recording EEG, and measuring motor evoked potentials (MEP) from the right hand to estimate corticospinal excitability.

Vagal sensory afferents monitor the internal milieu and maintain homeostasis by engaging brain circuits that alter physiology and behavior. While the importance of the body-to-brain communication that underlies interoception is implicit, the vagal afferents and corresponding brain circuits that shape perception of the viscera are largely unknown. Here, we use mice to parse neural circuits subserving interoception of the heart and gut. We determine vagal sensory afferents expressing the oxytocin receptor, hereafter referred to as NDGOxtr, send projections to the aortic arch or stomach and duodenum with molecular and structural features indicative of mechanosensation. Chemogenetic excitation of NDGOxtr significantly decreases food and water consumption, and remarkably, produces a torpor-like phenotype characterized by reductions in cardiac output, body temperature, and energy expenditure. Chemogenetic excitation of NDGOxtr also creates patterns of brain activity associated with augmented hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and behavioral indices of vigilance. Recurrent excitation of NDGOxtr suppresses food intake and lowers body mass, indicating that mechanosensation of the heart and gut can exert enduring effects on energy balance.

    "abstract": "Trophic interaction networks are notoriously difficult to understand and to diagnose. Such ecological networks welcome numerous feedbacks between species and populations and are not frozen at all, as soon as we observe them over a long enough term. These topological changes may be triggered by natural forcings (e.g. seasons) and/or by human influences (e.g. nutrient or pollution inputs). Aquatic trophic networks are especially dynamics and versatile, thus supporting new approaches for diagnosing network dynamics in a comprehensive way.\n\nIn this study, we build a possibilistic model for this purpose. Borrowing discrete event models to theoretical computer sciences, we developed a mechanistic and qualitative model allowing computing exhaustive dynamics of a given trophic network. Once the model definition assumed, it provides all possible pathways of the trophic network from a chosen initial state. In a rigorous and analytical approach, we validated the model on one theoretical and two observed trajectories recorded at freshwater stations in La Rochelle region (Western France). The model appears easy to build and intuitive, and it provided other relevant pathways to the expert community. We hope such mathematical approach to open a new avenue in diagnosing and predicting trophic (and non-trophic) ecological networks.",

    "abstract": "In the field of evolutionary biology, researchers have long been interested in comprehending the patterns of diversification and elucidating the mechanisms responsible for the impressive variety of lifeforms observed within taxonomic groups. Based on the fossil records of Felidae, and using a Bayesian framework, we assess here how speciation and extinction rates vary across the last 25 Myr, and how it can potentially be associated with changes in two major ecomorphological traits of Felidae, body mass and carnassial teeth, over such time span. We found two coupled independent increases in both traits along Felidae evolution, one in Machairodontinae, which gradually increases over the last 15 Myr, and the second in Panthera, which rapidly increases within 5 million years. Furthermore, gradual reductions in body mass and carnassial teeth were also observed for some genera such as Leopardus, Lynx, and Felis. Diversification rates showed a gradual reduction throughout the Miocene and Pliocene, with significant rate shifts occurring around 9 and 2 Myr. We suggest that felids were influenced by major environmental changes over the last 17 Myr that probably shaped both traits studied here in order to hunt larger herbivores, but also to explore new niches that became available.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale genetic circuits are rapidly becoming critical components for the next generation of biotechnologies and living therapeutics. However, the relationship between synthetic and host gene expression is poorly understood. To reveal the impact of genetic circuits on their host, we measure the transcriptional response of wild-type and engineered E. coli MG1655 subject to seven genomically integrated circuits and two plasmid-based circuits across 4 growth time points and 4 circuit input states resulting in 1007 transcriptional profiles. We train a classifier to distinguish profiles from wild-type or engineered strains and use the classifier to identify synthetic construct burdened genes, i.e., genes whose dysregulation is dependent on the presence of a genetic circuit and not what is encoded on the circuit. We develop a deep learning architecture, capable of disentangling influence of combinations of perturbations, to model the impact that synthetic genes have on their host. We use the model to hypothesize a generalizable, synthetic cell state phenotype and validate the phenotype through antibiotic challenge experiments. The synthetic cell state results in increased resistance to {beta}-lactam antibiotics in gram-negative bacteria. This work enhances our understanding of circuit impact by quantifying the disruption of host biological processes and can guide the design of robust genetic circuits with minimal burden or uncover novel biological circuits and phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "The accelerated rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant global health risk, necessitating the exploration of alternative strategies for combating pathogenic infections. Biofilm-related infections, which are unresponsive to standard antibiotics, often require the use of higher-order antimicrobials with toxic side effects and a potential for disrupting the microbiome. Probiotic therapy, with its diverse benefits and inherent safety, is emerging as a promising approach for preventing and treating various infections and as an alternative to antibiotic therapy. In this study, we isolated novel probiotic bacteria from the gut of domestic goats (Capra hircus) and evaluated their antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities against the  ESKAPE group of pathogens. We performed comprehensive microbiological, biochemical, and molecular characterizations, including analysis of the 16S-rRNA gene V1-V3 region and the 16S-23S ISR region, on 20 caprine gut-derived lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Among these, six selected LABs demonstrated substantial biofilm formation in anaerobic conditions, and exhibited robust cell surface hydrophobicity and autoaggregation properties highlighting their superior enteric colonization capability. Notably, these LAB isolates exhibited broad-spectrum growth inhibitory and anti-biofilm properties against  ESKAPE pathogens. Additionally, the LAB isolates were susceptible to antibiotics listed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), within the prescribed Minimum Inhibitory Concentration limits, suggesting their safety as feed additives. The remarkable probiotic characteristics exhibited by the caprine gut-derived LAB isolates in this study strongly endorse their potential as compelling alternatives to antibiotics and as direct-fed microbial (DFM) feed supplements in the livestock industry, addressing the escalating need for antibiotic-free animal products.",

    "abstract": "Major portion of wheat grain consist of carbohydrate, mainly starch. The proportion of amylose and amylopectin in starch greatly influence the end product quality. Advancement in understanding starch biosynthesis pathway and modulating key genes has enabled the genetic modification of crops resulting in enhanced starch quality. However, the regulation of starch biosynthesis genes still remains unexplored. So, to expand the limited knowledge, here, we characterized a Ser/Thr kinase, SnRK1 in wheat and determined its role in regulating starch biosynthesis. SnRK1 is an evolutionary conserved protein kinase and share homology to yeast SNF1. Yeast complementation assay suggest TaSnRK1 restore growth defect and promotes glycogen accumulation. Domain analysis and complementation assay with truncated proteins suggest the importance of ATP-binding and UBA domain in TaSnRK1 activity. Sub-cellular localization identified nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of TaSnRK1 in tobacco leaves. Further, heterologous over-expression (O/E) of TaSnRK1 in Arabidopsis not only led to increase in starch content but also enlarges the starch granules. TaSnRK1 was found to restore starch accumulation in Arabidopsis kin10. Remarkably, TaSnRK1 O/E increase the AGPase activity suggesting the direct regulation of rate limiting enzyme AGPase involved in starch biosynthesis. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo interaction assay reveal that TaSnRK1 interacts with AGPase large sub-unit. Overall, our findings indicate that TaSnRK1 plays role in starch biosynthesis by regulating AGPase activity.\n\nHighlightsO_LITaSnRK1 is Ser/Thr kinase in wheat and show dual localization in nucleus and cytoplasm.\nC_LIO_LIOverexpression of TaSnRK1 increases starch content and enlarges starch granules in Arabidopsis.\nC_LIO_LITaSnRK1 enhances AGPase activity thereby regulating starch biosynthesis.\nC_LIO_LITaSnRK1 directly interact with AGPase large subunit in vivo and in vitro.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic and its lock-down measures have resulted in periods of reduced human activity, known as anthropause. While this period was expected to be favorable for the marine ecosystem, due to a probable reduction of pollution, shipping traffic, industrial activity and fishing pressure, negative counterparts such as the increased use of disposable plastic and reduced fisheries surveillance and enforcement could counterbalance these positive effects. Simultaneously, on-land pressure due to human disturbance and tourism should have drastically decreased, potentially benefiting land-based marine breeders such as seabirds. Thus, long-term datasets became crucial to differentiate between historical trends and any evident changes resulting from the anthropause. We analyzed 11 years of data on several biological parameters of little penguins (Eudyptula minor) from the Penguin Parade (R), a popular tourist attraction at Phillip Island, Australia. We investigated the impact of anthropogenic activities on penguin behavior during the breeding season measured by (1) distribution at sea, (2) colony attendance, (3) isotopic niche (4) chick meal mass, and (5) offspring investment against shipping traffic and number of tourists. The 2020 lock-downs resulted in a near absence of tourists visiting the Penguin Parade (R), which was otherwise visited by 800,000+ visitors on average per year. However, our long-term analysis showed no effect of the presence of visitors on little penguins activities. Surprisingly, the anthropause did not triggered any changes in maritime traffic intensity and distribution in the region. While we found significant inter- and intra-annual variations for most parameters, we detected a negative effect of marine traffic on the foraging efficiency. Our results suggest that environmental variations have a greater influence on the breeding behavior of little penguins compared to short-term anthropause events. Our long-term dataset was key to test whether changes in anthropogenic activities affected the wildlife during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nImpact statementWe found that marine traffic, but not tourist presence, negatively impact the foraging and provisioning behavior of little penguins.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSESystematic repurposing of approved medicine for another indication represents an attractive strategy to accelerating drug development in oncology. Herein we present a strategy of combining biomarker testing with drug repurposing to identify new treatments for patients with advanced cancer.\n\nMETHODSTumours were sequenced with Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 (TSO-500) platform or the FoundationOne(R) CDx panel. Mutations were manually screened by two medical oncology clinicians and pathogenic mutations were categorised with reference to the literature. Variants of unknown significance were classified as potentially pathogenic if a plausible mechanism and computational prediction of pathogenicity existed. Gain of function mutations were evaluated through the repurposing databases Probe Miner, the Broad Institute Drug Repurposing Hub (Broad Institute DRH) and TOPOGRAPH. Gain of function mutations were classified as repurposing events if they were identified in Probe Miner, were not indexed in TOPOGRAPH which captures active clinical trial biomarkers and excluding mutations for which a known FDA-approved biomarker label exists. The performance of the computational repurposing approach was validated by evaluating its ability to identify known FDA-approved biomarkers. Exploratory functional analyses were performed with gene expression data and CRISPR-dependency data sourced from the DepMap portal. The total repurposable genome was identified by evaluating all possible gene-FDA drug approved combinations in the Probe Miner dataset.\n\nRESULTSThe computational repurposing approach was highly accurate at identifying FDA therapies with known biomarkers (94%). Using a real-world dataset of next-generation sequencing molecular reports (n = 94) and excluding the identification of mutations that would render patients eligible for FDA-licensed therapies or local clinical trials, it was found that a meaningful percentage of patients (14%) would have an off-label therapeutic identified through this approach. Exploratory analyses were performed, including the identification of drug-target interactions that have been previously described in the medicinal chemistry literature but are not well known, and the evaluation of the frequency of theoretical drug repurposing events in the TCGA pan-cancer dataset (73% of samples in the cohort).\n\nCONCLUSIONOverall, a computational drug repurposing approach may assist in identifying novel repurposing events in cancer patients with advanced tumours and no access to standard therapies. Further validation is needed to confirm the utility of a precision oncology approach using drug repurposing.",

    "abstract": "Entropic forces have been argued to allow bacteria to segregate their chromosomes during replication. In many bacterial species, however, specifically evolved mechanisms, such as loop-extruding SMC complexes and the ParABS origin segregation system, are required for chromosome segregation, suggesting that entropic forces alone may be insufficient. The interplay between and the relative contributions of these segregation mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we develop a biophysical model showing that purely entropic forces actually inhibit bacterial chromosome segregation until late stages of the replication cycle. By contrast, we find that loop-extruders loaded at the origins of replication, as found in many bacterial species, alter the effective topology of the chromosome, thereby redirecting and enhancing entropic forces to enable accurate chromosome segregation concurrent with replication. In addition, our model indicates that locally acting origin separation mechanisms, such as the ParABS system, cannot redirect segregation-inhibiting entropic forces. We confirm our predictions with 3D simulations of a replicating polymer: purely entropic forces do not allow for concurrent replication and segregation; entropic forces steered by loop-extruders loaded at the origin lead to robust, global chromosome segregation; and origin separation alone is effective at early replication stages, but does not fully segregate terminal regions. Together, our results illustrate how entropic forces and loop-extrusion play synergistic roles during bacterial chromosome segregation, whereas locally acting mechanisms serve a complementary function.",

However, the removal of Lepr from neither alpha nor beta cells mimics these results. Because Lepr is enriched in the delta cells of human islets, we used a mouse model to test whether delta cells mediate the diminished glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in response to leptin.

More specifically, we identified a compartment-specific regulation of protein levels and localization changes of metabolic enzymes to reprogram branched chain amino acid and one-carbon metabolism to provide building blocks and reduction equivalents for lipid synthesis.

    "abstract": "The cellular imbalance between high concentrations of ribonucleotides (NTPs) and low concentrations of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs), is challenging for DNA polymerases when building DNA from dNTPs. It is currently believed that DNA polymerases discriminate against NTPs through a steric gate model involving a clash between a tyrosine and the 2-hydroxyl of the ribonucleotide in the polymerase active site in B-family DNA polymerases. With the help of crystal structures of a B-family polymerase with a UTP or CTP in the active site, molecular dynamics simulations, biochemical assays and yeast genetics, we have identified a mechanism by which the finger domain of the polymerase sense NTPs in the polymerase active site. In contrast to the previously proposed polar filter, our experiments suggest that the amino acid residue in the finger domain senses ribonucleotides by steric hindrance. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the steric gate in the palm domain and the sensor in the finger domain are both important when discriminating NTPs. Structural comparisons reveal that the sensor residue is conserved among B-family polymerases and we hypothesize that a sensor in the finger domain should be considered in all types of DNA polymerases.",

    "abstract": "DNA stores our genetic information and is ubiquitous in biological and biotechnological applications, where it interacts with binding partners ranging from small molecules to large macromolecular complexes. Binding is modulated by mechanical strains in the molecule and, in turn, can change the local DNA structure. Frequently, DNA occurs in closed topological forms where topology and supercoiling add a global constraint to the interplay of binding-induced deformations and strain-modulated binding. Here, we present a quantitative model of how the global constraints introduced by DNA topology modulate binding and create a complex interplay between topology and affinity. We focus on fluorescent intercalators, which unwind DNA and enable direct quantification via fluorescence detection. Using bulk measurements, we show that DNA supercoiling can increase or decrease intercalation relative to an open topology depending on ligand concentration and the initial topology. Our model quantitatively accounts for observations obtained using psoralen for UV-induced DNA crosslinking, which is frequently used to quantify supercoiling in vivo. Finally, we observe topology-dependent binding in a single-molecule assay, which provides direct access to binding kinetics and DNA supercoil dynamics. Our results have broad implications for the detection and quantification of DNA and for the modulation of DNA binding in cellular contexts.",

    "abstract": "Cranial irradiation is used for prophylactic brain radiotherapy as well as treatment of primary brain tumors. Despite its high efficiency, it often induces unexpected side effects, including cognitive dysfunction. Herein, we observed that mice exposed to cranial irradiation exhibited cognitive dysfunction, including altered spontaneous behavior, decreased spatial memory, and reduced novel object recognition. Analysis of actin cytoskeleton revealed that ionizing radiation (IR) disrupted the filamentous/globular actin (F/G-actin) ratio and downregulated the actin turnover signaling pathway p21-activated kinase 3 (PAK3)-LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1)-cofilin. Furthermore, we found that IR could upregulate microRNA-206-3p (miR-206-3p) targeting PAK3. As the inhibition of miR-206-3p through antagonist (antagomiR), IR-induced disruption of PAK3 signaling is restored. In addition, intranasal administration of antagomiR-206-3p recovered IR-induced cognitive impairment in mice. Our results suggest that cranial irradiation-induced cognitive impairment could be ameliorated by regulating PAK3 through antagomiR-206-3p, thereby affording a promising strategy for protecting cognitive function during cranial irradiation, and promoting quality of life in patients with radiation therapy.",

    "abstract": "Wnt, an evolutionarily conserved morphogen, is vital for various cell fates specification during early development. However, a concrete mechanistic understanding of the precise and fine-tuned regulation of Wnt underlying these processes is yet to be uncovered. Using the murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) model, we have identified USP3, a histone deubiquitinase (DUB), displaying bimodal action, serving both as a downstream Wnt target and a regulator of canonical Wnt signalling. Using both loss- and gain-of-function approaches, we could identify USP3 as essential for mesoderm specification, exerting a differential influence during further differentiation. While cardiogenic mesoderm was negatively regulated and so also cardiomyogenesis, USP3 positively regulated hemangioblasts differentiation. Interestingly, however, these induced hemangioblasts promoted the haematopoietic program at the expense of endothelial differentiation. The mechanistic underpinning revealed USP3 localizing to chromatin and differentially modulating these fate choices by precise and contextual deposition of H2AUb/H2BUb in the promoters of mesoderm genes. Collectively our study underscored the Wnt-USP3 link underlying differential mesodermal fate modulation.",

    "abstract": "The colony level of eusocial insects is considered the reproductive unit on which natural selection operates. Therefore, seasonal demographic movements and estimations of colony size are crucial variables. Excavating colonies of ants to extract their size is daunting, unhealthy to the surrounding environment, and it may prevent long-term research, including testing seasonal effects on colony size. Previous capture-recapture methods that avoid excavating colonies have been proven inefficient when sampling mostly underground dwellers as ants. To address this issue, we offer a simple method to estimate the colony size of desert ants (Cataglyphis niger) in a field setting- based on a field experiment, a literature review, and four laboratory experiments. First, we find that between 10-15% of the colony size are outgoing foragers. Second, we find seasonal effects on colony size and foraging activity: colony size varies and is larger in winter than in summer, and in contrast - the proportion of foragers out of colony size is higher in summer than in winter. This suggests that the energetic requirements of the colonies are higher in summer than in winter. Based on uniquely large sample size, our proposed field method may be useful for other co-occurring Cataglyphis species. Moreover, extracting ant colony sizes and evaluating ant biomass is advantageous for future studies to evaluate the carrying capacity of semi sand-dunes habitats.",

    "abstract": "Across internally fertilising species, males transfer proteins in their ejaculate that trigger wide-ranging changes in female behaviour and physiology. Much theory has been developed to explore the drivers of ejaculate protein evolution. The accelerating availability of high-quality genomes now allows us to test how these proteins are evolving at fine taxonomic scales. Here, we use genomes from 199, mostly drosophilid, species to chart the evolutionary history of Sex Peptide (SP), a potent regulator of female post-mating responses. We infer that SP has followed markedly different evolutionary trajectories in different lineages. Outside of the Sophophora-Lordiphosa radiation, SP exists largely as a single copy gene that has been independently lost in several lineages. In contrast, within the Sophophora-Lordiphosa radiation SP has repeatedly and independently duplicated. Up to seven copies, collectively displaying extensive variation in sequence, are present in some species. We use cross-species RNA-seq data to provide evidence that this lineage-specific burst in evolutionary activity did not follow a significant shift in the sex- or tissue-specificity of SPs expression. We also document considerable interspecific variation in accessory gland microcarriers that appears to be independent of SP presence or sequence. We end by showing that the mode of SPs evolution is decoupled from that of its receptor, SPR, in which we detect no evidence of correlated diversifying selection in its coding sequence. Collectively, our work describes the divergent evolutionary trajectories that an apparently novel drosophilid gene has followed in different branches of the phylogeny and finds a surprisingly weak coevolutionary signal between a supposedly sexually antagonistic protein and its receptor.",

Prostate tumor patient data analysis revealed a negative correlation between RNF185 expression and prostate cancer progression and metastasis. Likewise, several prostate cancer cell lines exhibited greater migration and invasion capabilities in culture upon RNF185 depletion. Subcutaneous inoculation of mouse prostate cancer MPC3 cells stably expressing shRNA against RNF185 into mice resulted in larger tumors and more frequent lung metastases. RNA-sequencing and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified wound healing and cellular movement among the most significant pathways upregulated in RNF185-depleted, compared to control prostate cancer cells. Gene Set Enrichment Analyses performed in samples from patients harboring low RNF185 expression and in RNF185-depleted lines confirmed the deregulation of genes implicated in EMT. Among those, COL3A1 was identified as the primary mediator of RNF185s ability to impact migration phenotypes. Correspondingly, enhanced migration and metastasis of RNF185 KD prostate cancer cells were attenuated upon co-inhibition of COL3A1.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDInsecticides are critical for controlling mosquito populations and mitigating the spread of vector-borne disease, but their overuse has selected for resistant populations. A promising alternative to classical chemical insecticides is photosensitive molecules--here called photosensitive insecticides or PSIs--that when ingested and activated by light, generate broadly toxic reactive oxygen species. This mechanism of indiscriminate oxidative damage decreases the likelihood that target site modification-based resistance evolves. Here, we tested whether the PSIs, methylene blue (MB) and rose bengal (RB), are viable insecticides across the mosquito lineage.\n\nRESULTSMB and RB are phototoxic to both Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae at micromolar concentrations, with greatest toxicity when larvae are incubated in the dark with the PSIs for 2 hr prior to photoactivation. MB is ten times more toxic than RB, and microscopy-based imaging suggests that this is because ingested MB escapes the larval gut and disperses throughout the hemocoel whereas RB remains confined to the gut. Adding food to the PSI-containing water has a bidirectional, concentration-dependent effect on PSI toxicity; toxicity increases at high concentrations but decreases at low concentrations. Finally, adding sand to the water increases the phototoxicity of RB to Aedes aegypti.\n\nCONCLUSIONMB and RB are larvicidal via a light activated mechanism, and therefore, should be further investigated as an option for mosquito control.",

    "abstract": "Sensitivity and plasticity of insulin signaling and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle depends on determinants such as genetic variation and obesity. We collected muscle biopsies and isolated myoblasts from a multi-ethnic cohort of lean South Asians (N=10), lean Chinese (N=10), and obese Chinese (N=10), and analysed the proteome and phosphoproteome dynamics in terminally differentiated myotubes after a low-dose insulin stimulation (10nM at 0, 5, 30 min). The myotubes initially responded with increased abundance and phosphorylation level changes along the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, decreased abundance of translation initiation factors, and increased phosphorylation levels on proteins involved in mRNA processing at 5 min. After the acute response, protein abundance returned to baseline at 30 min, while phosphorylation changes persisted in proteins including AKT, RPS6 and AS160 (TBC1D4). A joint kinase-substrate statistical analysis revealed that protein abundance changes of AKT, PAK1 and CDK1 showed concordant phosphorylation changes in their respective substrates upon insulin stimulation. We also observed increased phosphorylation of some substrates uniquely in each group, particularly the substrates of CDKs showing stronger changes in South Asians than in Chinese. Pharmacological inhibition and siRNA knockdown of CDK1, a non-myogenic kinase, in terminally differentiated myotubes reduced glucose uptake and desensitized several phosphorylation-mediated signaling on protein translation initiation factors, IRS1, and AS160. Our data suggest that basal extramitotic activity of CDK1 is required for PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signaling cascade and glucose uptake in insulin-stimulated myotubes. The data also provide a rich resource for studying the role of other kinases in the mechanism of insulin resistance in human myotubes.",

    "abstract": "Plants have the ability to perceive a slight upsurge in ambient temperature and respond by undergoing morphological changes, such as elongated hypocotyls and early flowering. The dynamic functioning of PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) in thermomorphogenesis has been well established, although the regulatory pathway involved in thermosensing is not deciphered completely. In our study, we demonstrate that an increase in temperature from 22 to 28 induces the phosphorylation of PIF4 by MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 4 (MPK4) which shows high expression and activation at 28. Apparently, phosphorylated PIF4 represses the expression of ACTIN-RELATED PROTEIN 6 (ARP6) that is required for mediating histone variant H2A.Z deposition at its target gene loci. We demonstrate that variation of ARP6 expression in PIF4 phosphor -null and phosphor-mimetic seedlings affects hypocotyl growth and flowering at 22 and 28. Further, we show that change in ARP6 expression affects H2A.Z deposition at the loci of genes involved in hypocotyl elongation using PIF4 phosphor -null and phosphor-mimetic seedlings. Interestingly, the expression of MPK4 is also controlled by H2A.Z deposition in temperature dependent manner. Taken together, our findings highlight the cumulative molecular interplay between MPK4, PIF4, and chromatin modification by ARP6-mediated H2A.Z deposition as a regulatory mechanism of thermosensing.",

    "abstract": "Treatment-refractory severe asthma manifests a neutrophilic phenotype associated with TH17 responses. Heightened unfolded protein responses (UPRs) are associated with the risk of asthma, including severe asthma. However, how UPRs participate in the deregulation of TH17 cells leading to this type of asthma remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the role of the UPR sensor IRE1 in TH17 cell function and neutrophilic airway inflammation. We found that IRE1 is induced in fungal asthma and is highly expressed in TH17 cells relative to naive CD4+ T cells. Cytokine (e.g. IL-23) signals induce the IRE1-XBP1s axis in a JAK2-dependent manner. This noncanonical activation of the IRE1-XBP1s pathway promotes UPRs and cytokine secretion by TH17 cells. Ern1 (encoding IRE1)-deficiency decreases the expression of ER stress factors and impairs the differentiation and cytokine secretion of TH17 cells. Genetic ablation of Ern1 leads to alleviated TH17 responses and airway neutrophilia in a Candida albicans asthma model. Consistently, IL-23 activates the JAK2-IRE1-XBP1s pathway in vivo and enhances TH17 responses and neutrophilic infiltration into the airway. Taken together, our data indicate that IRE1, noncanonically activated by cytokine signals, promotes neutrophilic airway inflammation through the UPR- mediated secretory function of TH17 cells. The findings provide a novel insight into the fundamental understanding of IRE1 in TH17-biased TH2-low asthma.",

    "abstract": "Allergic disorders are common diseases marked by the abnormal immune response towards foreign antigens that are not pathogens. Often patients with food allergy also suffer from asthma and eczema. Given the similarities of these diseases and a shortage of effective treatments, developing novel therapeutics against common targets of multiple allergies would offer an efficient and cost-effective treatment for patients. Herein, we employed the artificial intelligence-driven target discovery platform, PandaOmics, to identify common targets for treating asthma, eczema, and food allergy. Thirty-two case-control comparisons were generated from 15, 11, and 6 transcriptomics datasets related to asthma (558 cases, 315 controls), eczema (441 cases, 371 controls), and food allergy (208 cases, 106 controls) respectively, and allocated into three meta-analyses for target identification. Top-100 high-confidence targets and Top-100 novel targets were prioritized by PandaOmics for each allergic disease. Six common high-confidence targets (i.e., IL4R, IL5, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and NR3C1) across all three allergic diseases have approved drugs for treating asthma and eczema. Based on the targets' dysregulated expression profiles and their mechanism of action in allergic diseases, three potential therapeutic targets were proposed. IL5 was selected as a high-confidence target due to its strong involvement in allergies. PTAFR was identified for drug repurposing, while RNF19B was selected as a novel target for therapeutic innovation. Analysis of the dysregulated pathways commonly identified across asthma, eczema, and food allergy revealed the well-characterized disease signature and novel biological processes that may underlie the pathophysiology of allergies. Altogether, our study dissects the shared pathophysiology of allergic disorders and reveals the power of artificial intelligence in the exploration of novel therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary dynamics of large gene families can offer important insights into the functions of their individual members. While the ecdysteroid kinase-like (EcKL) gene family has previously been linked to the metabolism of both steroid moulting hormones and xenobiotic toxins, the functions of nearly all EcKL genes are unknown and there is little information on their evolution across all insects. Here, we perform comprehensive phylogenetic analyses on a manually annotated set of EcKL genes from 140 insect genomes, revealing the gene family is comprised of at least 13 subfamilies that differ in retention and stability. Our results show the only two genes known to encode ecdysteroid kinases belong to different subfamilies and therefore ecdysteroid metabolism functions must be spread throughout the EcKL family. We also provide comparative phylogenomic evidence that EcKLs are involved in detoxification across insects, with positive associations between family size and dietary chemical complexity, and also find similar evidence for the cytochrome P450 and glutathione S-transferase gene families. Unexpectedly, we find that the size of the clade containing a known ecdysteroid kinase is positively associated with host plant taxonomic diversity in Lepidoptera, possibly suggesting multiple functional shifts between hormone and xenobiotic metabolism. This work provides a robust framework for future functional studies into the EcKL gene family and opens promising new avenues for exploring the genomic basis of dietary adaptation in insects, including the classically studied co-evolution of butterflies with their host plants.\n\nSignificance statementThe ecdysteroid kinase-like (EcKL) gene family has been linked to both steroid inactivation and detoxification in insects, but the functions of most of its members are unknown. Here, we study the evolutionary history of the EcKLs and showcase how phylogenetics can inform the functional characterisation of enzyme families. EcKL family size varies over an order of magnitude and is associated with chemically complex diets, implicating numerous genes in detoxification. We also find a surprising link between a steroid-metabolising clade and host plant diversity in butterflies and moths, suggesting new detoxification functions may evolve through an insect-plant  chemical arms-race. This work advances numerous functional hypotheses for multiple EcKL clades and proposes a new classification system for this poorly characterised gene family.",

    "abstract": "Conventional protein-protein docking algorithms usually rely on heavy candidate sampling and re-ranking, but these steps are time-consuming and hinder applications that require high-throughput complex structure prediction, e.g., structure-based virtual screening. Existing deep learning methods for protein-protein docking, despite being much faster, suffer from low docking success rates. In addition, they simplify the problem to assume no conformational changes within any protein upon binding (rigid docking). This assumption precludes applications when binding-induced conformational changes play a role, such as allosteric inhibition or docking from uncertain unbound model structures. To address these limitations, we present GeoDock, a multi-track iterative transformer network to predict a docked structure from separate docking partners. Unlike deep learning models for protein structure prediction that input multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), GeoDock inputs just the sequences and structures of the docking partners, which suits the tasks when the individual structures are given. GeoDock is flexible at the protein residue level, allowing the prediction of conformational changes upon binding. For a benchmark set of rigid targets, GeoDock obtains a 41% success rate, outperforming all the other tested methods. For a more challenging benchmark set of flexible targets, GeoDock achieves a similar number of top-model successes as the traditional method ClusPro [1], but fewer than ReplicaDock2 [2]. GeoDock attains an average inference speed of under one second on a single GPU, enabling its application in large-scale structure screening. Although binding-induced conformational changes are still a challenge owing to limited training and evaluation data, our architecture sets up the foundation to capture this backbone flexibility. Code and a demonstration Jupyter notebook are available at https://github.com/Graylab/GeoDock.",

    "abstract": "AbstractsSpline interpolants are commonly used for discretizing and estimating functions in mathematical models. While splines can be encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) using piecewise functions, the resulting formulas are very complex and difficult to derive by hand. Tools to create such formulas exist but only deal with numeric data and thus cannot be used for function estimation. Similarly, simulation tools suffer from several limitations when handling splines. For example, in the AMICI library splines with large numbers of nodes lead to long model import times.\n\nWe have developed a set of SBML annotations to mark assignment rules as spline formulas. These compact representations are human-readable and easy to edit, in contrast to the piecewise representation. Different boundary conditions and extrapolation methods can also be specified. By extending AMICI to create and recognize these annotations, model import can be sped up significantly. This allows practitioners to increase the expressivity of their models.\n\nWhile the performance improvement is limited to AMICI, our tools for creating spline formulas can be used for other tools as well and our syntax for compact spline representation may be a starting point for an SBML-native way to represent spline interpolants.",

    "abstract": "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) neutralizes treatment with platinum (Pt)-based chemotherapy by removing Pt lesions from DNA. Previous study has identified that missense mutation or loss of either of the NER genes Excision Repair Cross Complementation Group 1 and 2 (ERCC1 and ERCC2) leads to improved patient outcomes after treatment with Pt-based chemotherapies. Although most NER gene alterations found in patient tumors are missense mutations, the impact of such mutations in the remaining nearly 20 NER genes is unknown. Towards this goal, we previously developed a machine learning strategy to predict genetic variants in an essential NER scaffold protein, Xeroderma Pigmentosum Complementation Group A (XPA), that disrupt repair activity on a UV-damaged substrate. In this study, we report in-depth analyses of a subset of the predicted NER-deficient XPA variants, including in vitro analyses of purified recombinant protein and cell-based assays to test Pt agent sensitivity in cells and determine mechanisms of NER dysfunction. The most NER deficient variant Y148D had reduced protein stability, weaker DNA binding, disrupted recruitment to damage, and degradation resulting from tumor missense mutation. Our findings demonstrate that tumor mutations in XPA impact cell survival after cisplatin treatment and provide valuable mechanistic insights to further improve variant effect prediction efforts. More broadly, these findings suggest XPA tumor variants should be considered when predicting patient response to Pt-based chemotherapy.\n\nSignificanceA destabilized, readily degraded tumor variant identified in the NER scaffold protein XPA sensitizes cells to cisplatin, suggesting that XPA variants can be used to predict response to chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIsocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant gliomas exhibit unique metabolic and biological features that may make them vulnerable to specific treatment. In this study, we investigated the selective vulnerability of IDH-mutant gliomas to zotiraciclib (ZTR).\n\nMethodsWe examined ZTR-induced cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction, and biogenesis defect at RNA, protein, and cellular levels. The survival benefit and pharmacodynamics of ZTR were evaluated using mouse models bearing mutant or wildtype IDH.\n\nResultsThe IC50 of ZTR in IDH-mutant patient-derived glioma cells was more than 50% lower than in IDH-wildtype cells. A high-throughput drug screen, utilizing a library of 2,481 approved and investigational drugs, provided independent evidence that ZTR was one of the most effective agents against IDH-mutant gliomas. ZTR-induced suppression of CDK9 and RNA Pol II phosphorylation was more pronounced in IDH-mutant cells. Low-dose ZTR (15 nM) suppressed mitochondrial respiration complexes and NAD+ production, leading to oxidative stress in IDH-mutant but not in IDH-wildtype cells. Furthermore, ZTR exposure resulted in a decrease in glycolysis, exacerbating bioenergetic failure. Finally, ZTR significantly prolonged the survival of mice bearing intracranial IDH-mutant gliomas but not in the IDH-wildtype counterpart. The combination of mitochondrial dysfunction and the inability to adapt to oxidative stress leads to potent ZTR-induced cell death and thereby an increased therapeutic vulnerability in IDH-mutant gliomas.\n\nConclusionsThe findings led to the launch of a clinical trial of ZTR in IDH-mutant gliomas towards precision medicine (NCT 05588141).",

    "abstract": "Agent-based models are commonly used in biology to study tissue-scale phenomena by reproducing the individual behavior of the cells. They offer the possibility to study cellular biology at the individual cell scale to explore the basic behavior of cells which are responsible of the emergence of more complex phenomena at the tissue scale. Additionally, they can produce a predictive tool that will help taking decisions for biologic experiments based on in silico simulations. However these models require a good intercomprehension between the biologists and the modelers and thus it may take weeks or months to end up providing a usable prototype.\n\nTo address this limitation, we propose a new methodology to facilitate the dialog between biologists and modelers and improve biologists involvement in the design of the model. For this purpose, UML diagrams, in particular, state-transition and activity diagrams, are used. They allow a better comprehension of the model for the biologists and offer a general frame for structuring models. Visualization of simulations is also used to have qualitative feedbacks from the biologist on the model. They are instrumental to validate or refine the prototype before exploring it.\n\nAlongside this methodology, we propose a web platform that enables to build state-transition and activity diagrams to describe a model and translate them into code. The generated code is then compiled on-the-fly and simulations are ready to visualize and explore. The platform also disposes of tools to directly visualize and manually explore the model. These tools allow for qualitative validation of the model and additional interaction with the biologists.\n\nFinally in this article, we show the capacity of our platform to reproduce models from the literature and to build new models starting from workshops with biologists. Its range of application is wide and includes immunology, oncology or cell biology.\n\nAuthor summaryWe developed a methodology based on diagrams to facilitate the dialog between computer scientists and biologists when building in silico models. The main idea is to limit misunderstandings and improve the involvement of the biologists in the prototyping process. For this purpose, we use visual methods to simplify the modeling phase. Alongside this methodology, we propose a web platform, called ISiCell, which enables to visually code thanks to diagrams that will be translated into code. The platform allows for compiling the generated code on the fly and to visualize and explore the model directly with the platform. The strong advantage of the platform is that one day workshop biologist/modeler allows to build new models. Additionally, we were able to reproduce models from the literature within the modeling platform showing the versatility of the tool.\n\nOur long-term objective is to use our methodology and platform in new contexts to develop new models. We intend the make the platform more user friendly in order to expand the community of users. Involving biologists in the conception of in silico models might improve their acceptability in the community.",

    "abstract": "Long-term biodiversity monitoring is necessary for the conservation and management of water resources. Notably, aquatic insects have been used as an indicator of water quality because they provide important basic information about freshwater ecosystems and water resources. Although environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys can enable easy and effective biomonitoring of aquatic insects, previous studies have not successfully detected all insect species, and there has been frequent amplification of nontarget taxa (e.g., algae and diatoms). Therefore, we developed a universal primers set, MtInsects-16S, for eDNA analyses of insects in the mtDNA 16SrRNA region. Furthermore, a well-established database of aquatic insects, especially the MtInsects-16S DNA region of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera in Kanagawa Prefecture, which was the target area in this study, was constructed. Therefore, in this study, we conducted eDNA analyses using a universal primers set and using a well-established database. We conducted and compared capture surveys at the same sites to examine the detection capability of eDNA for Insecta. As a result, eDNA analyses using MtInsects- 16S not only detected almost all of the captured species but also detected many more species without amplifying nontarget taxa. This study demonstrated the application of eDNA analyses with unprecedented accuracy and reliability. It was also shown that community structure by eDNA reflected a relatively narrow range at the water sampling point. Although the data accumulation for constructing locally specific databases is an urgent issue, using the MtInsects-16S region is expected to be a breakthrough in the metabarcoding of insects.",

    "abstract": "The massive COVID-19 vaccine roll-out campaign illuminated a range of rare side effects, the most dangerous of which - vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) - is caused by adenoviral (Ad)-vectored vaccines. VITT occurrence had been linked to production of pathogenic antibodies that recognize an endogenous chemokine, platelet factor 4 (PF4). Mass spectrometry (MS)-based evaluation of the ensemble of anti-PF4 antibodies obtained from a VITT patients blood indicates that its major component is a monoclonal antibody. Structural characterization of this antibody reveals several unusual characteristics, such as the presence of an N-glycan in the Fab segment and high density of acidic amino acid residues in the CDR regions. A recombinant version of this antibody (RVT1) was generated by transient expression in mammalian cells based on the newly determined sequence. It captures the key properties of VITT antibodies, such as their ability to activate platelets in a PF4-dependent fashion. Homology modeling of the Fab segment reveals a well-defined polyanionic paratope, and the docking studies indicate that the polycationic segment of PF4 readily accommodates two Fab segments, cross-linking the antibodies to yield polymerized immune complexes. Their existence was verified with native MS by detecting assemblies as large as (RVT1)3(PF4)2, pointing out at Fc{gamma}RIIa-mediated platelet activation as the molecular mechanism underlying VITT clinical manifestations. In addition to high PF4 affinity, RVT1 readily binds other polycationic targets, indicating a polyreactive nature of this antibody. This surprising polyspecificity not only sheds light on VITT etiology, but also opens up a range of opportunities to manage this pathology.\n\nSignificance StatementVaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a dangerous side effect of adenoviral-vectored vaccines that is linked to the emergence of autoantibodies recognizing platelet factor 4 (PF4). We have engineered a recombinant VITT antibody by sequencing a VITT patient-derived anti-PF4 monoclonal antibody that causes platelet activation and triggers thrombosis. This antibody was used to characterize architecture of the pathogenic immune complexes with a combination of biophysical and computational approaches, revealing the molecular mechanism of VITT. The results of this work demonstrate the critical role of electrostatics in PF4 recognition by the pathogenic antibody and the polyspecificity of the latter. Availability of the engineered VITT antibody will be invaluable for future studies aiming at understanding the general mechanistic features of autoimmune pathologies.",
