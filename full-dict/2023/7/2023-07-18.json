    "abstract": "BackgroundCultivated spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is a highly nutritional crop species of great economical value that belongs to a genus of dioecious plant species with both homomorphic and heteromorphic sex chromosomes. The wild spinach species Spinacia turkestanica and Spinacia tetrandra are important genetic sources for improving cultivated spinach and excellent material for studying sex chromosome evolution in plants. However, until now there were no publicly available genome assemblies for these species.\n\nResultsHere we sequenced and assembled the genomes of S. turkestanica and S. tetrandra and performed a tri-way comparative analysis with S. oleracea. We show that many abiotic- and biotic stress related gene clusters have expanded through tandem duplication in S. tetrandra after it diverged from the S. turkestanica - S. oleracea lineage. Focussing on the sex chromosomes we found that the previously identified inversion distinguishing the S. oleracea male- and female-SEX DETERMINING REGIONs (SDRs) is conserved in S. turkestanica. Although, the SDRs of these two species coincides with the PSEUDO AUTOSOMAL REGION of S. tetrandra the gene content is only partially conserved and the genetic factors determining sex in these species might differ. Finally, we show that recombination suppression between the S. tetrandra X- and Y-chromosomes resulted in a highly degenerated Y-chromosome and started before the species diverged from S. turkestanica and S. oleracea.\n\nConclusionsWe expect that the novel wild spinach species genomes are of great value to the breeding community and evolutionary biologist especially focussing on the evolution of sex chromosomes in plants.",

    "abstract": "The creation-selection-mutation model makes predictions regarding the fitness of asexual and sexual populations in an environment that incorporates both positive and negative selection. The model predicts the optimal spontaneous mutation rate for a sexual population as one in which the fitness losses associated with positive and negative selection are equal. The model depends upon three mutation related rates: the rate of adaptive mutational opportunities, the rate of negative mutational site creation, and the spontaneous mutation rate. These three mutation related rates are estimated based on a comparison of substitution rates at nonsynonymous and synonymous sites in the genomes of related eukaryotic species. For eukaryotes, the rate of adaptive mutation opportunities is found to typically be in the range 10-3 to 10-2 population wide adaptive mutational opportunity sites per sexual generation. Negative sites are typically created at the rate 10-1 to 101 sites per haploid genome per sexual generation. And the spontaneous mutation rate is typically in the range 10-9 to 10-8 spontaneous mutations per creation-mutation-selection model site per sexual generation. Effective population sizes are also computed based on the assumption of optimal mutation rates. That effective population sizes appear reasonable, adds some evidence to the claim that evolution tunes the mutation rate towards a near optimal value.",

    "abstract": "How perennial organisms adapt to environments is a key question in biology. To address this question, we investigated ten natural black poplar (Populus nigra) populations from Western Europe, a keystone forest tree of riparian ecosystems. We assessed the role of (epi)genetic regulation in driving tree species evolution and adaptation over several millions of years (macro-evolution) up to a few generations (micro-evolution). At the macro-evolution scale, polar experienced differential structural (gene loss) and regulation (expression and methylation) reprogramming between sister genomic compartments inherited from polyploidization events. More interestingly, at the micro-evolution scale, both genetic and epigenetic variations differentiate populations from different geographic origins, targeting specifically genes involved in disease resistance, immune response, hormonal and stress response that can be considered as key functions of local adaptation of long lifespan species. Moreover, genes involved in cambium formation, an important functional trait for forest trees, as well as basal functions for cell survival are constitutively expressed though methylation control. These results highlight DNA methylation as a marker of population differentiation, evolutionary adaptation to diverse ecological environments and ultimately opening the need to take epigenetic marks into account in breeding strategies, especially for woody plants.",

The inherent similarities between natural language and biological sequences have prompted a new wave of inferring the grammatical rules underneath the biological sequences. In genomic study, it is worth noting that DNA sequences alone cannot explain all the gene activities due to epigenetic mechanism. To investigate this problem, we propose EpiGePT, a new transformer-based language pretrained model in epigenomics, for predicting genome-wide epigenomic signals by considering the mechanistic modeling of transcriptional regulation. Specifically, EpiGePT takes the context-specific activities of transcription factors (TFs) into consideration, which could offer deeper biological insights comparing to models trained on DNA sequence only. In a series of experiments, EpiGePT demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in a diverse epigenomic signals prediction tasks as well as new prediction tasks by fine-tuning. Furthermore, EpiGePT is capable of learning the cell-type-specific long-range interactions through the self-attention mechanism and interpreting the genetic variants that associated with human diseases. We expect that the advances of EpiGePT can shed light on understanding the complex regulatory mechanisms in gene regulation.

    "abstract": "Protein misfolding diseases, such as prion diseases, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons, share a common molecular mechanism involving the misfolding and aggregation of specific proteins. There is an urgent need for point-of-care (POC) diagnostic technologies that can accurately detect these misfolded proteins, facilitating early diagnosis and intervention. Here, we introduce the Microfluidic Quaking Induced Conversion (Micro-QuIC), a novel acoustofluidic platform for the rapid and sensitive detection of protein misfolding diseases. We demonstrate the utility of our technology using chronic wasting disease (CWD) as a model system, as samples from wild white-tailed deer are readily accessible, and CWD shares similarities with human protein misfolding diseases. Acoustofluidic mixing enables homogeneous mixing of reagents in a high-Reynolds-number regime, significantly accelerating the turnaround time for CWD diagnosis. Our Micro-QuIC assay amplifies prions by an order of magnitude faster than the current gold standard, real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC). Furthermore, we integrated Micro-QuIC with a gold nanoparticle-based, naked-eye detection method, which enables visual discrimination between CWD positive and negative samples without the need for a bulky fluorescence detection module. This integration creates a rapid, POC testing platform capable of detecting misfolded proteins associated with a variety of protein misfolding diseases.\n\nTOC graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/549283v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@885eeaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10f820eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12396eaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@188fe0f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Itaconic acid is an emerging platform chemical with extensive applications. It is currently produced by Aspergillus terreus through biological fermentation. However, A. terreus is a fungal pathogen and needs additional morphology controls, and therefore the production remains problematic. Here, we reprogrammed the GRAS yeast Yarrowia lipolytica metabolism for competitive itaconic acid production. After redirecting the flux of lipid accumulation as carbon sink, we evaluated itaconic acid production both inside and outside the mitochondria, and fine modulated its synthetic pathway. We then mimicked the regulation of nitrogen limitation in nitrogen replete conditions through down regulation of IDH by weak promoter changing, RNAi, or CRISPRi. Ultimately, we optimized fermentation parameters for fed-batch cultivations, and produced itaconic acid with titres of 130.1 g/L in 1L bioreactors and 94.8 g/L in a 50L bioreactor on semi-pilot scale. Our finds provide effective approaches for harnessing GRAS microorganism for competitive industrial itaconic acid production.",

    "abstract": "Encapsulins, self-assembling protein nanocages derived from prokaryotes, are promising nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems (NDDS). However, the in vivo behavior and fate of encapsulins are poorly understood. In this pre-clinical study, we probe the interactions between the model encapsulin from Thermotoga maritima (TmEnc) and key biological barriers encountered by NDDS. Here, a purified TmEnc formulation that exhibited colloidal stability, storability, and blood compatibility was intravenously injected into BALB/c mice. TmEnc had an excellent nanosafety profile, with no abnormal weight loss or gross pathology observed, and only temporary alterations in toxicity biomarkers detected. Notably, TmEnc demonstrated immunogenic properties, inducing the generation of nanocage-specific IgM and IgG antibodies, but without any prolonged pro-inflammatory effects. An absence of antibody cross-reactivity also suggested immune-orthogonality among encapsulins systems. Moreover, TmEnc formed a serum-derived protein corona on its surface which changed dynamically and appeared to play a role in immune recognition. TmEncs biodistribution profile further revealed its sequestration from the blood circulation by the liver and then biodegraded within Kupffer cells, thus indicating clearance via the mononuclear phagocyte system. Collectively, these findings provide critical insights into how encapsulins behave in vivo, thereby informing their future design, modification, and application in targeted drug delivery.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=187 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/549228v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1691ecaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@647c31org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@115a146org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10f2b6f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Biology-inspired deep learning, where the architecture of the computational graph is based on biological knowledge, enables unique interpretability where real-world concepts are encoded in hidden nodes, which can be ranked by importance and thereby interpreted. In such models trained on single-cell transcriptomes, we previously demonstrated that node-level interpretations lack robustness upon repeated training and are influenced by biases in biological knowledge. Similar studies are missing for related models. Here, we test and extend our methodology for reliable interpretability in P-NET, a biology-inspired model trained on patient mutation data. We observe variability of interpretations and susceptibility to knowledge biases, and identify the network properties that drive interpretation biases. We further present an approach to control the robustness and biases of interpretations, which leads to more specific interpretations. In summary, our study reveals the broad importance of methods to ensure robust and bias-aware interpretability in biology-inspired deep learning.",

    "abstract": "The stoichiometry of molecular components within supramolecular biological complexes is often an important property to understand their biological functioning, particularly within their native environment. While there are well established methods to determine stoichiometry in vitro, it is presently challenging to precisely quantify this property in vivo, especially with single molecule resolution that is needed for the characterization stoichiometry heterogeneity. Previous work has shown that optical microscopy can provide some information to this end, but it can be challenging to obtain highly precise measurements at higher densities of fluorophores. Here we provide a simple approach using already established procedures in single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) to enable precise quantification of stoichiometry within individual complexes regardless of the density of fluorophores. We show that by focusing on the number of fluorophore detections accumulated during the quasi equilibrium-state of this process, this method yields a 50-fold improvement in precision over values obtained from images with higher densities of active fluorophores. Further, we show that our method yields more correct estimates of stoichiometry with nuclear pore complexes and is easily adaptable to quantify the DNA content with nanodomains of chromatin within individual chromosomes inside cells. Thus, we envision that this straightforward method may become a common approach by which SMLM can be routinely employed for the accurate quantification of subunit stoichiometry within individual complexes within cells.",

In this paper, we apply a machine learning method to predict the path of fixation in several complex graphs and two regular graphs.

Rather, we focus on predicting the probability of progression forward (referred to as{lambda} in the literature) using the machine learning model. By using previous achievements in determining the fixation path for the Moran process, obtaining the path of fixation becomes straightforward. Due to the time and computational resources required for simulating an evolutionary process in a large population, utilizing a machine learning method can help us save both of these valuable resources. This approach can provide insights to researchers studying evolutionary processes in the context of meta-population problems.",

Given that reduced CAF abundance in tumors correlates with improved outcomes in various cancers, we set out to identify epigenetic targets involved in CAF activation in the tumor-stromal margin to reduce overall tumor aggressiveness. Using the GLAnCE (Gels for Live Analysis of Compartmentalized Environments) co-culture platform, we performed an image-based, phenotypic screen and identified EHMT2 (also known as G9a), an epigenetic enzyme that targets the methylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9), as the most potent modulator of CAF abundance and CAF-mediated tumor cell invasion. Transcriptomic and functional analysis of EHMT2-inhibited CAFs revealed the involvement of EHMT2 in driving CAFs towards a pro-invasive phenotype. Further, EHMT2 signaling mediated CAF hyperproliferation, a feature that is typically associated with activated fibroblasts present in tumors, but the molecular basis for which has not thus far been identified. This study suggests a role for EHMT2 as a regulator of CAF hyperproliferation within the tumor mass, which in turn magnifies CAF-induced pro-invasive effects on tumor cells.",

Here, using cryogenic fluorescence microscopy (cryoFM)-targeted cryo-sectioning, cryo-focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (cryoFIB-SEM) liftout and cryo-electron tomography (cryoET), we determined the in-tissue structure of {beta}-amyloid and tau pathology in fresh post-mortem AD donor brain. {beta}-amyloid plaques contained a mixture of fibrils and protofilaments arranged in parallel arrays and lattice-like structures, some of which were branched. Extracellular vesicles, extracellular droplets and open lipid bilayer sheets defined non-amyloid constituents of amyloid plaques. In contrast, tau inclusions were characterised by clusters of unbranched filaments. Subtomogram averaging of filaments within each cluster revealed distinct structures including variably twisted paired helical filaments (PHF) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)-like tau filaments that were situated [~]1 m apart within two microscopic regions of pathology. Filaments within a cluster were similar to each other, but different between clusters, showing that fibril heterogeneity is spatially organised and influenced by the subcellular tissue environment. The in situ structural approaches outlined here for targeting specific proteins within human donor tissues have applications to a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The combination of subcortical Local Field Potential (LFP) recordings and stimulation with Magnetoencephalography (MEG) in Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) patients enables the investigation of cortico-subcortical communication patterns and provides insights into DBS mechanisms. Until now, these recordings have been carried out in post-surgical patients with externalised leads. However, a new generation of telemetric stimulators makes it possible to record and stream LFP data in chronically implanted patients. Nevertheless, whether such streaming can be combined with MEG has not been tested.\n\nIn the present study, we tested the most commonly implanted telemetric stimulator - Medtronic Percept PC with a phantom in three different MEG systems: two cryogenic scanners (CTF and MEGIN) and an experimental Optically Pumped Magnetometry (OPM)-based system.\n\nWe found that when used in combination with the new SenSight segmented leads, Percept PC telemetric streaming only generates band-limited interference in the MEG at 123Hz and harmonics. However, the  legacy streaming mode used with older lead models generates multiple, dense artefact peaks in the physiological range of interest (below 50Hz).\n\nThe effect of stimulation on MEG critically depends on whether it is done in bipolar (between two contacts on the lead) or monopolar (between a lead contact and the stimulator case) mode. Monopolar DBS creates severe interference in the MEG as previously reported. However, we found that the OPM system is more resilient to this interference and could provide artefact-free measurements at least for limited frequency ranges.\n\nA resting measurement in the MEGIN system from a Parkinsons patient implanted with Percept PC and subthalamic SenSight leads revealed artefact patterns consistent with our phantom recordings. Moreover, analysis of LFP-MEG coherence in this patient showed oscillatory coherent networks consistent in their frequency and topography with those described in published group studies done with externalised leads.\n\nIn conclusion, Percept PC telemetric streaming with SenSight leads is compatible with MEG. Furthermore, OPM sensors could provide additional new opportunities for studying DBS effects.",

    "abstract": "Brain structural integrity has been suggested to contribute to the variability in human sleep quality and composition. The associations between sleep parameters and the regional integrity of subcortical structures implicated in sleep-wake regulation remain, however, largely unexplored. The present study aimed at assessing association between quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (qMRI)-derived marker of the myelin content of the brainstem with the variability in the sleep electrophysiology in a large sample of healthy young men (N=321;[~]22y). Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) was used to seek associations between sleep metrics and Magnetisation Transfer saturation (MTsat) qMRI values, proxy for myelin content. Separate GAMLSS revealed that sleep onset latency and slow wave sleep intensity were significantly associated with MTsat-derived myelin estimates in the brainstem (pcorrected[&le;].03), with overall higher MTsat value associated with values reflecting better sleep quality. The association changed with age, however (MTsat-by-age interaction - pcorrected[&le;].03), with higher MTsat value linked to better values in the two sleep metrics in the individuals of our sample aged [~]18 to 20y. Similar associations were detected across different parts of the brainstem (pcorrected[&le;].03), suggesting that the overall maturation and integrity of the brainstem was associated with both sleep metrics. Our results suggest that myelination of the many reticular nuclei of the brainstem essential to regulation of sleep is associated with inter-individual differences in sleep characteristics during early adulthood. They may have implications for sleep disorders or neurological diseases related to myelin.",

    "abstract": "Whilst previous research has linked attenuation of the mu rhythm to the observation of specific visual categories, and even to a potential role in action observation via a putative mirror neuron system, much of this work has not considered what specific type of information might be coded in this oscillatory response when triggered via vision. Here, we sought to determine whether the mu rhythm contains content-specific information about the identity of familiar (and also unfamiliar) graspable objects. In the present study, right-handed participants (N=27) viewed images of both familiar (apple, wine glass) and unfamiliar (cubie, smoothie) graspable objects, whilst performing an orthogonal task at fixation. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed significant decoding of familiar, but not unfamiliar, visual object categories in the mu rhythm response. Thus, simply viewing familiar graspable objects may automatically trigger activation of associated tactile and/or motor properties in sensorimotor areas, reflected in the mu rhythm. In addition, we report significant attenuation in the central beta band for both familiar and unfamiliar visual objects, but not in the mu rhythm. Our findings highlight how analysing two different aspects of the oscillatory response - either attenuation or the representation of information content - provide complementary views on the role of the mu rhythm in response to viewing graspable object categories.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe Mu Rhythm oscillation contains fine-grained information about the identity of familiar, graspable objects (but not unfamiliar)\nC_LIO_LIThis study offers evidence of a possible oscillatory marker for cross-sensory effects involving sensorimotor and visual cortices\nC_LIO_LIDifferent analysis techniques (univariate vs multivariate) imply different conclusions about the role of specific oscillations in the perception of graspable objects\nC_LIO_LIThe alpha rhythm at occipital sites shows greater attenuation for unfamiliar objects but better representation for familiar objects consistent with sharpening accounts of Predictive Processing\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is accurately defining brain states and predicting how and where to perturb the brain to force a transition. The ability to promote a transition from one brain state to another by externally driven stimulation could significantly impact rehabilitation and treatments for patients suffering from complex brain injury cases. Thus, it is crucial to find therapeutic interventions able to re-balance the dynamics of brain disorders towards more healthy regimes. Here, we investigated resting-state fMRI data of patients suffering from disorders of consciousness (DoC) after coma (minimally conscious and unresponsive wakefulness states) and healthy controls. We applied model-free and model-based approaches to help elucidate the underlying brain mechanisms of patients with DoC. The model-free approach allowed us to characterize brain states in DoC and healthy controls as a probabilistic metastable substate (PMS) space. The PMS of each group was characterized by a repertoire of unique patterns (i.e., metastable substates) with different probabilities of occurrence. In the model-based approach, we adjusted the PMS of each DoC group to a causal whole-brain model. This allowed us to explore optimal strategies for promoting a transition to the PMS of the control group by applying off-line in silico probing. Furthermore, this approach enabled us to evaluate the impact of all possible local perturbations in terms of their global effects and sensitivity to stimulation, which is a biomarker providing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying DoC. Our results show that transitions from DoC to more healthy regimes were obtained in a synchronous protocol, in which areas from the motor and subcortical networks were the most sensitive to perturbation. This motivates further work to continue understanding brain function and treatments of disorders of consciousness by external stimulation.\n\nAuthor summaryWe studied disorders of consciousness by defining a brain state as a repertoire of metastable substates with different probabilities of occurrence. We created whole-brain computational models of DoC to uncover the causal mechanisms underlying recovery. These models allowed us to transition from DoC to a control healthy state by studying the effects of artificial individual local perturbations under different protocol regimes. We demonstrated successful transitions in the synchronization protocol and showed that the most sensitive areas were located in the motor network and subcortical regions. We believe this could be very valuable for developing clinical treatments and has a great deal for future therapies.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionsFunctional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) is a non-invasive technique for measuring dynamic changes in neurometabolites. While previous studies have observed concentration changes in metabolites during neural activation, the relationship between neurometabolite response and stimulus intensity and timing requires further investigation. To address this, we conducted an interleaved fMRS and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment using a visual stimulus with varying contrast levels.\n\nMethodsA total of 20 datasets were acquired on a 7T MRI scanner. The visual task consisted of two STIM blocks (30s/20s ON/OFF, four minutes), with 10% or 100% contrast, interleaved with a four minutes REST block. A dynamic fitting approach was used for fMRS data analysis. For metabolite level changes, the STIM conditions were modeled in two different ways: either considering the full STIM block as active condition (full-block model) or only modeling the ON blocks as active condition (sub-block model). For linewidth changes due to the BOLD effect, STIM conditions were modeled using the sub-block model.\n\nResultsFor both models, we observed significant increases in glutamate levels for both the 10% and 100% visual contrasts, but no significant difference between the contrasts. Decreases in aspartate, and glucose, and increases in total N-acetylaspartate and total creatine were also detected, although less consistently across both 10% and 100% visual contrasts. BOLD-driven linewidth decreases and fMRI-derived BOLD increases within the MRS voxel were observed at both 10% and 100% contrasts, with larger changes at 100% compared to 10% in the fMRI-derived BOLD only. We observed a non-linear relation between visual contrast, the BOLD response, and the glutamate response.\n\nConclusionOur study highlights the potential of fMRS as a complementary technique to BOLD fMRI for investigating the complex interplay between visual contrast, neural activity, and neurometabolism. Future studies should further explore the temporal response profiles of different neurometabolites and refine the statistical models used for fMRS analysis.",

Using an approach to image the 3- D deformation of the skin surface while in contact with transparent elastic objects, we evaluate a cohort of 40 young participants, who present a diverse range of finger size, skin stiffness, and fingerprint ridge breadth. The results indicate that skin stiffness generally correlates with finger size, although individuals with relatively softer skin can better discriminate compliant objects. Analysis of contact at the skin surface reveals that softer skin generates more prominent patterns of deformation, in particular greater rates of change in contact area, which correlate with higher rates of perceptual discrimination, regardless of finger size. Moreover, upon applying hyaluronic acid to soften individuals skin, we observe immediate, marked and systematic changes in skin deformation and consequent improvements in perceptual acuity. Together, the combination of 3- D imaging of the skin surface, biomechanics measurements, multivariate regression and clustering, and psychophysical experiments show that subtle distinctions in skin stiffness modulate the mechanical signaling of touch and shape individual differences in perceptual acuity.\n\nKey points described in the manuscriptO_LIWhile declines in tactile acuity with aging are a function of multiple factors, for younger people the current working hypothesis has been that smaller fingers are better at informing perceptual discrimination due to a higher density of neural afferents.\nC_LIO_LITo decouple relative impacts on tactile acuity of skin properties of finger size, skin stiffness, and fingerprint ridge breadth, we combined 3D imaging of skin surface deformation, biomechanical measurements, multivariate regression and clustering, and psychophysics.\nC_LIO_LIThe results indicate skin stiffness generally correlates with finger size, although more robustly correlates with and predicts an individuals perceptual acuity.\nC_LIO_LIIn particular, more elastic skin generates higher rates of deformation, which correlate with perceptual discrimination, shown most dramatically by softening each participants skin with hyaluronic acid.\nC_LIO_LIIn refining the current working hypothesis, we show the skins stiffness strongly shapes the signaling of touch and modulates individual differences in perceptual acuity.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "It is widely believed that memory storage depends on activity-dependent synaptic modifications. Classical studies of learning and memory in neural networks describe synaptic efficacy either as continuous [1, 2] or discrete [2-4]. However, recent results suggest an intermediate scenario in which synaptic efficacy can be described by a continuous variable, but whose distribution is peaked around a small set of discrete values [5, 6]. Motivated by these results, we explored a model in which each synapse is described by a continuous variable that evolves in a potential with multiple minima. External inputs to the network can switch synapses from one potential well to another. Our analytical and numerical results show that this model can interpolate between models with discrete synapses which correspond to the deep potential limit [7], and models in which synapses evolve in a single quadratic potential [8]. We find that the storage capacity of the network with double-well synapses exhibits a power law dependence on the network size, rather than the logarithmic dependence observed in models with single well synapses [9]. In addition, synapses with deeper potential wells lead to more robust information storage in the presence of noise. When memories are sparsely encoded, the scaling of the capacity with network size is similar to previously studied network models in the sparse coding limit [2, 10-13].",

    "abstract": "Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) lining the lymphatic vessels of the lymph node (LN) parenchyma orchestrate leukocyte trafficking and peripheral T cell dynamics. T cell responses to immunotherapy largely rely on peripheral T cell recruitment in tumors. Yet, a systematic and molecular understanding of how LECs within the LNs control T cell dynamics under steady state and tumor-bearing conditions is lacking. Using intravital and high-resolution imaging combined with immune phenotyping, we show that LEC-specific deletion of the essential autophagy gene Atg5 alters intranodal positioning of lymphocytes and accrues their persistence in the LNs, by increasing the availability of the main egress signal S1P. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of tumor-draining LNs from WT and ATG5LEC-KO mice unveils that loss of ATG5 remodels niche-specific LEC phenotypes, involved in molecular pathways regulating lymphocyte trafficking and LEC-T cell interactions. Functionally, loss of LEC-autophagy prevents recruitment of tumor-infiltrating T cells and NK cells and abrogates tumor regression in response to anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA4-based immunotherapy. Thus, a unique LEC-autophagy program boosts immune-checkpoint responses by guiding systemic T cell dynamics.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=143 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/549282v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a4bfe1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1317fe2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c2fa20org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b35dba_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

To this end, various systems immunology studies have been established.

MI used immunophenotyping of a 1000 healthy donor cohort by flow cytometry as a principal outcome for immune variance at steady state. For the 10-year longitudinal MI study, we have developed two high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry panels that allow deep characterization of innate and adaptive whole blood immune cells (35 and 34 fluorescent markers, respectively) and standardized the protocol for sample handling, staining, acquisition, and data analysis. This permits the reproducible quantification of over 182 immune cell phenotypes through robust immunophenotyping at a single site. This highly standardized protocol was applied to samples from patients with autoimmune/inflammatory diseases.

    "abstract": "Evolutionary transitions in individuality introduce new levels of selection and thus enable discordant selection, threatening the stability of the transition. Cancer is such a problem for multicellularity. So why have so many transitions to multicellularity persisted? One possibility is that the unicellular propagule maintains cooperation among cells by purging cheaters. The evolution of propagule size has been modeled previously, but in the absence of competition between individuals, which may often select for larger propagules. How does the nature of competition between individuals affect the optimal propagule size in the presence of cancer? Here we take a model of early multicellularity, add cancer, and simulate size-dependent competition on a lattice, which allows us to tune the strength of interspecific vs. intraspecific competition via dispersal. As expected, cancer favours strategies with unicellular propagules while size-dependent competition favours strategies with few large propagules (binary fragmentation). How these opposing forces resolve depends on dispersal. Local dispersal, which intensifies intraspecific competition, favours binary fragmentation, which reduces intraspecific competition for space, with one unicellular propagule. Global dispersal instead favours multiple fission when cancer is common. Our results shed light on the evolution of multicellular life cycles and the prevalence of unicellular propagules across the tree of life.\n\nAuthor summaryA multicellular organism is a group of cooperating cells. But wherever there is cooperation there is the temptation to cheat. Cancer cells are cheating cells. Having offspring that start as a single cell (the unicellular propagule) has been hypothesized as an adaptation to deal with these cheating cells by increasing kinship among cells in the organism and purging lineages of cancer cells. We model the evolution of offspring size but add competition between individuals, which may select against small unicellular offspring. We find that having some unicellular offspring is a successful strategy, but how many depends on the nature of competition.",

    "abstract": "Childhood appetitive traits are consistently associated with obesity risk, and yet their etiology is poorly understood. Appetitive traits are complex phenotypes which are hypothesized to be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, as well as their interactions. Early-life epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), may be involved in the developmental programming of appetite regulation in childhood. In the current study, we meta-analyzed epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) of cord blood DNAm and early-childhood appetitive traits. Data were from two independent cohorts: the Generation R Study (n=1,086, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) and the Healthy Start study (n=236, Colorado, USA). DNAm at autosomal methylation sites in cord blood was measured using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Parents reported on their childs food responsiveness, emotional undereating, satiety responsiveness and food fussiness using the Childrens Eating Behaviour Questionnaire at age 4-5 years. Multiple regression models were used to examine the association of DNAm (predictor) at the individual site- and regional-level (using DMRff) with each appetitive trait (outcome), adjusting for covariates. Bonferroni-correction was applied to adjust for multiple testing. There were no associations of DNAm and any appetitive trait at the individual site-level. However, at the regional level, we identified 45 associations of DNAm with food responsiveness, 7 associations of DNAm with emotional undereating, 13 associations of DNAm with satiety responsiveness, and 9 associations of DNAm with food fussiness. This study shows that DNAm in the newborn may partially explain variation in appetitive traits expressed in early childhood and provides preliminary support for early programming of child appetitive traits through DNAm. Investigating differential DNAm associated with appetitive traits could be an important first step in identifying biological pathways underlying the development of these behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Alternative Splicing (AS) is a post-transcriptional process by which a single RNA can lead to different mRNA and, in some cases, several proteins. Various processes (probably many of them yet to be discovered) are involved in the regulation of alternative splicing. This work focuses on the regulation by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). In addition to splicing regulation, these proteins are related to cancer prognosis and are emerging therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. CLIP-seq experiments target selected RBPs and result in uncovering the loci of the nascent transcriptome to where the RBP binds to. The presence of changes in the splicing status surrounding these loci is a good starting point to establishing a causal relationship. The selection of the specific RBP(s) to target in the CLIP-seq experiment is not straightforward; in many cases, this selection is driven by apriori hypotheses.\n\nIn this work, we have developed an algorithm to detect RBPs that are likely related to the splicing changes between conditions. To do this we have integrated several databases of CLIP-seq experiments with an algorithm that detects differential splicing events to discover RBPs that are especially enriched in these events. This is a follow-up of a previous work that is refined by 1) improving the algorithm to predict the splicing events and 2) testing different enrichment statistics, and 3) performing additional validation experiments. As a result, the new method provides more accurate predictions, and it is also included in the Bioconductor package EventPointer.\n\nWe tested the algorithm in four different experiments where seven different RBPs were knocked down. The algorithm accurately states the statistical significance of these RBPs using only the alterations in splicing. We also applied the algorithm to study sixteen cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found relationships between RBPs and several cancer types like CREBBP and MBNL2 alterations in adenocarcinomas of the lung, liver, prostate, rectum, stomach, and colon cancer. Some of these relationships have been validated in the literature but other ones are novel.\n\nAvailabilityThis method is integrated EventPointer, an available Bioconductor R package.",

    "abstract": "Epitope vaccines are a promising approach for precision treatment of pathogens, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and allergies. Effectively designing such vaccines requires accurate proteasomal cleavage prediction to ensure that the epitopes included in the vaccine trigger an immune response. The performance of proteasomal cleavage predictors has been steadily improving over the past decades owing to increasing data availability and methodological advances. In this review, we summarize the current proteasomal cleavage prediction landscape and, in light of recent progress in the field of deep learning, develop and compare a wide range of recent architectures and techniques, including long short-term memory (LSTM), transformers, and convolutional neural networks (CNN), as well as four different denoising techniques. All opensource cleavage predictors re-trained on our dataset performed within two AUC percentage points. Our comprehensive deep learning architecture benchmark improved performance by 0.4 AUC percentage points, while closed-source predictors performed considerably worse. We found that a wide range of architectures and training regimes all result in very similar performance, suggesting that the specific modeling approach employed has a limited impact on predictive performance compared to the specifics of the dataset employed. We speculate that the noise and implicit nature of data acquisition techniques used for training proteasomal cleavage prediction models and the complexity of biological processes of the antigen processing pathway are the major limiting factors. While biological complexity can be tackled by more data and, to a lesser extent, better models, noise and randomness inherently limit the maximum achievable predictive performance.\n\nKey pointsO_LIWe benchmark a wide range of neural architectures and learning methods for proteasomal cleavage prediction.\nC_LIO_LIPredictors re-trained on our dataset performed similarly and better than closed source, pretrained predictors.\nC_LIO_LIWe show clear performance plateaus with little variation among methods.\nC_LIO_LIWe argue that collecting more data or using different learning methods is unlikely to yield significant performance gains.\nC_LI",

This requires highly polarised axonal surface expression of CB1R, but how this is achieved remains unclear. We previously reported that the H9 domain in the intracellular C-terminus of CB1R contributes to polarised surface expression by an unknown mechanism. Here we show the H9 domain binds to the endocytic adaptor protein SGIP1 to promote CB1R expression in the axonal membrane. Overexpression of SGIP1 increases CB1R axonal surface localisation but has no effect on CB1R lacking the H9 domain (CB1R{Delta}H9). Conversely, SGIP1 knockdown reduces axonal surface expression of CB1R but does not affect CB1R{Delta}H9. Furthermore, SGIP1 knockdown diminishes CB1R-mediated inhibition of presynaptic Ca2+ influx in response to neuronal activity. Together, these data advance mechanistic understanding of endocannabinoid signalling by demonstrating that SGIP1 interaction with H9 underpins axonal CB1R surface expression to regulate presynaptic responsiveness.",

    "abstract": "The development and homeostasis of organisms rely on the correct replication, maintenance and segregation of their genetic blueprints. How these intracellular processes are monitored across generations of different human cellular lineages, and why the spatio-temporal distribution of mosaicism varies during development remain unknown. Here, we identify several lineage specification signals that regulate chromosome segregation fidelity in both human and mouse pluripotent stem cells. Through epistatic analyses, we find that that WNT, BMP and FGF form a signalling \"rheostat\" upstream of ATM that monitors replication fork velocity, origin firing and DNA damage during S-phase in pluripotency, which in turn controls spindle polymerisation dynamics and faithful chromosome segregation in the following mitosis. Cell signalling control of chromosome segregation fidelity declines together with ATM activity after pluripotency exit and specification into the three human germ layers, or further differentiation into meso- and endoderm lineages, but re-emerges during neuronal lineage specification. In particular, we reveal that a tug-of-war between FGF and WNT signalling in neural progenitor cells results in DNA damage and chromosome missegregation during cortical neurogenesis, which could provide a rationale for the high levels of mosaicism in the human brain. Our results highlight a moonlighting role of morphogens, patterning signals and growth factors in genome maintenance during pluripotency and lineage specification, which could have important implications for our understanding on how mutations and aneuploidy arise during human development and disease.\n\nOne sentence summaryDevelopmental signals link genome maintenance to cell fate",

    "abstract": "S100A11 is a small Ca2+-activatable protein with an established role in different cellular processes involving actin cytoskeleton remodeling, such as cell migration, membrane protrusion formation, and plasma membrane repair. It also displays Ca2+-dependent F-actin binding activity and localizes to actin stress fibers (SFs), but its precise role in regulating these structures remains unclear. Analyzing endogenous S100A11 localization in HeLa and U2OS osteosarcoma cells confirmed SF association but in addition revealed steady localization to stable focal adhesions (FAs), typically at the end of dorsal stress fibers. In contrast, S100A11 levels at FAs increased sharply, but transiently, at the onset of peripheral FA disassembly. Elevating intracellular Ca2+ levels using the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin reliably stimulated both S100A11 recruitment and subsequent FA disassembly. However, pre-incubation with the non-muscle myosin II (NM II) inhibitor blebbistatin, or with an inhibitor to the stretch-activatable Ca2+ channel Piezo1 effectively suppressed S100A11 recruitment, implicating S100A11 in an actomyosin contractility-driven FA disassembly mechanism involving Piezo1-dependent Ca2+ influx. Applying external mechanical forces on peripheral FAs via a micropipette likewise recruited S100A11 to FAs, even when NM II was inhibited by blebbistatin or in NM IIA knockout cells, corroborating the mechanosensitive recruitment mechanism of S100A11. However, extracellular Ca2+ and Piezo1 function was still indispensable, indicating that NM II-dependent contraction forces act upstream of Piezo1-mediated Ca2+ influx, in turn leading to S100A11 activation and FA recruitment. Moreover, S100A11 knockout cells feature enlarged FAs and display delayed FA disassembly during cell membrane retraction, consistent with impaired FA turnover in these cells. Our results thus demonstrate a novel mechano-sensitive function for S100A11 in promoting actomyosin contractility-driven FA disassembly.",

Polarized hepatic epithelia organize their apical membrane domain into bile canaliculi and ducts, which are not accessible to circulating immune cells but that nevertheless confine most of ICAM-1. Here, by analyzing ICAM-1_KO human hepatic cells, liver organoids from ICAM-1_KO mice and rescue-of-function experiments, we show that ICAM-1 regulates epithelial apicobasal polarity in a leukocyte adhesion-independent manner. ICAM-1 signals to an actomyosin network at the base of canalicular microvilli, thereby controlling the dynamics and size of bile canalicular-like structures (BCs). We identified the scaffolding protein EBP50/NHERF1/SLC9A3R1, which connects membrane proteins with the underlying actin cytoskeleton, in the proximity interactome of ICAM-1. EBP50 and ICAM-1 form nano-scale domains that overlap in microvilli, from which ICAM-1 regulates EBP50 nano-organization. Indeed, EBP50 expression is required for ICAM-1-mediated control of BC morphogenesis and actomyosin. Our findings indicate that ICAM-1 regulates the dynamics of epithelial apical membrane domains beyond its role as a heterotypic cell-cell adhesion molecule and reveal potential therapeutic strategies for preserving epithelial architecture during inflammatory stress.",

Loss-of-function truncating variants of LMNA, the coding gene for Lamin-A/C, are one of the primary causes of inherited dilate cardiomyopathy (DCM). Here we aim to study whether AAV-based LMNA supplementation could treat LMNA deficiency-triggered cardiac defects.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe compared whole-body, cardiomyocyte-specific and genetic-mosaic mouse models that carry Lmna truncating variants at the same genetic loci and uncovered primarily a non-cell autonomous impact of Lmna on cardiomyocyte maturation. Whole-body lamin-A supplementation by rAAVs moderately rescued the cardiac defects in Lmna germline mutants. By contrast, cardiomyocyte-specific lamin-A addback failed to restore the cardiomyocyte growth defects. A Cre-loxP-based AAV vector that expresses lamin-A throughout the body but excluding the heart was able to restore cardiomyocyte growth in Lmna germline mutants.\n\nConclusionsLmna regulates cardiomyocyte growth non-cell autonomously. Non-myocytes are the key cell targets for a successful gene therapy for LMNA-associated cardiac defects.\n\nTranslational perspectiveLMNA truncating mutations are among the major causes of inherited DCM. AAV gene supplementation therapy is emerging as a promising strategy to treat genetic cardiomyopathy, but whether this strategy is suitable for LMNA cardiomyopathy remained unclear. Our study counterintuitively showed that the cardiomyocytes are not necessarily the correct therapeutic cell targets for AAV-based treatment of LMNA cardiomyopathy. By contrast, careful elucidation of cell-autonomous versus non-cell-autonomous gene functions is essential for the proper design of a gene supplementation therapy for cardiomyopathy.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=189 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/549413v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@37cfdaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2f2cd1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1278d08org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19c4869_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Tepsin is an established accessory protein found in Adaptor Protein 4 (AP-4) coated vesicles, but the biological role of tepsin remains unknown. AP-4 vesicles originate at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and target the delivery of ATG9A, a scramblase required for autophagosome biogenesis, to the cell periphery. Using in silico methods, we identified a putative LC3-Interacting Region (LIR) motif in tepsin. Biochemical experiments using purified recombinant proteins indicate tepsin directly binds LC3B, but not other members, of the mammalian ATG8 family. Calorimetry and structural modeling data indicate this interaction occurs with micromolar affinity using the established LC3B LIR docking site. Loss of tepsin in cultured cells dysregulates ATG9A export from the TGN as well as ATG9A distribution at the cell periphery. Tepsin depletion in a mRFP-GFP-LC3B HeLa reporter cell line using siRNA knockdown increases autophagosome volume and number, but does not appear to affect flux through the autophagic pathway. Re-introduction of wild-type tepsin partially rescues ATG9A cargo trafficking defects. In contrast, re-introducing tepsin with a mutated LIR motif or missing N-terminus does not fully rescue altered ATG9A subcellular distribution. Together, these data suggest roles for tepsin in cargo export from the TGN; delivery of ATG9A-positive vesicles at the cell periphery; and in overall maintenance of autophagosome structure.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation is an innate immune response triggered by harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, tissue injury, or toxins. The purpose is to eliminate the source of infection and initiate the healing process. However, an excessive acute inflammatory response can lead to severe and life-threatening complications, as seen during recent pandemics. In the context of viral infections, the activation of the TLR7/8 signaling pathway has been implicated in excessive cytokine secretion. In this study, we aimed to replicate the perturbed inflammatory environment resulting from the activation of the TLR7/8 specific agonists, imiquimod, and resiquimod.\n\nWe utilized macrophage-like cells, as macrophages are the first responders during infections and secrete key pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1{beta}) to recruit immune cells to the site of infection. Herbal medicines have been traditionally used for centuries to enhance respiratory immune function. In the present study, we employed a prophylactic approach, where macrophage-like THP1 cells, differentiated with PMA, were pre-treated with select herbal extracts/formulations prior to TLR7/8 activation in the presence of agonists.\n\nSeveral medicinal plants and formulations known for their therapeutic potential in respiratory ailments were investigated, including Withania somnifera, Tinospora cordifolia, Glycyrrhiza glabra, and AYUSH-64, an herbal formulation. The gene expression and corresponding secreted levels of various inflammatory mediators were measured using RT-PCR and ELISA methods, respectively, in treated and untreated differentiated THP1 cells induced with TLR7/8 agonists. Comparatively, the gene expression of inflammatory markers was significantly higher in resiquimod-induced cells than in imiquimod-treated cells. Notably, Withania somnifera demonstrated pronounced prophylactic efficacy compared to other herbs/formulations, as evidenced by reduction in expression of majority of investigated inflammatory marker genes.",

Among 50 spike-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) cloned from their B cells, the top 6 neutralizing mAbs (KXD01-06) belong to previously defined IGHV3-53/3-66 public antibodies. Although most antibodies in this class are dramatically escaped by VOCs, KXD01-06 exhibit broad neutralizing capacity with the IC50s of KXD01 ranging from 0.011[~]0.059g/ml. Deep mutational scanning reveals that KXD01-06 target highly conserved sites on RBD including D420, Y421, L455, F456, A475 and N487.

Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that spike protein expression, rather than ACE2 affinity, is the primary factor affecting viral infectivity and correlated with SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Notably, within the N-terminal domain (NTD), spike expression and infectivity-enhancing mutations are concentrated in flexible loops. We also observed that Omicron variants BA.1 and BA.2 exhibit immune evasion through receptor binding domain (RBD) mutations, although these mutations reduce structural stability. Interestingly, the NTD has evolved to increase stability, compensating for the RBD instability and resulting in heightened overall infectivity. Our findings, available in SpikeScanDB, emphasize the importance of spike expression levels and compensatory mutations in both the NTD and RBD domains for shaping Omicron variant infectivity.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to variants with improved transmission efficiency and reduced sensitivity to vaccine-induced humoral immunity has abolished the protective effect of licensed therapeutic human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). To fill this unmet medical need and protect vulnerable patient populations, we isolated the P4J15 mAb from a previously infected, vaccinated donor, with <20 ng/ml neutralizing activity against all Omicron variants including the latest XBB.2.3 and EG.1 sub-lineages. Structural studies of P4J15 in complex with Omicron XBB.1 Spike show that the P4J15 epitope shares [~]93% of its buried surface area with the ACE2 contact region, consistent with an ACE2 mimetic antibody. Although SARS-CoV-2 mutants escaping neutralization by P4J15 were selected in vitro, these displayed lower infectivity, poor binding to ACE2, and the corresponding  escape mutations are accordingly rare in public sequence databases. Using a SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5 monkey challenge model, we show that P4J15 confers complete prophylactic protection. We conclude that the P4J15 mAb has potential as a broad-spectrum anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug.",

    "abstract": "Constantly evolving viral populations affect the specificity of primers and quality of genomic surveillance. This study presents a framework for continuous optimisation of sequencing efficiency for public health surveillance based on the ongoing evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 genomic clustering capacity based on three amplification based whole genome sequencing schemes was assessed using decreasing thresholds of genome coverage and measured against epidemiologically linked cases. Overall genome coverage depth and individual amplicon depth were used to calculate an amplification efficiency metric. Significant loss of genome coverage over time was documented which was recovered by optimisation of primer pooling or implementation of new primer sets. A minimum of 95% genome coverage was required to cluster 94% of epidemiologically defined SARS-CoV-2 transmission events. Clustering resolution fell to 70% when only 85% of genome coverage was achieved. The framework presented in this study can provide public health genomic surveillance programs a systematic process to ensure an agile and effective laboratory response during rapidly evolving viral outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "The reality that volumes of published research are not reproducible has been increasingly recognised in recent years, notably in biomedical science. In many fields, spurious results are common, reducing trustworthiness of reported results. While this increases research waste, a common response is that science is ultimately self-correcting, and trustworthy science will eventually triumph. While this is likely true from a philosophy of science perspective, it does not yield information on how much effort is required to nullify suspect findings, nor factors that shape how quickly science may be correcting in the publish-or-perish environment scientists operate. There is also a paucity of information on how perverse incentives of the publishing ecosystem, which reward novel positive findings over null results, shaping the ability of published science to self-correct. Precisely what factors shape self-correction of science remain obscure, limiting our ability to mitigate harms. This modelling study illuminates these questions, introducing a simple model to capture dynamics of the publication ecosystem, exploring factors influencing research waste, trustworthiness, corrective effort, and time to correction. Results from this work indicate that research waste and corrective effort are highly dependent on field-specific false positive rates and the time delay before corrective results to spurious findings are propagated. The model also suggests conditions under which biomedical science is self-correcting, and those under which publication of correctives alone cannot stem the propagation of untrustworthy results. Finally, this work models a variety of potential mitigation strategies, including researcher and publication driven interventions.\n\nSignificance statementIn biomedical science, there is increasing recognition that many results fail to replicate, impeding both scientific advances and trust in science. While science is self-correcting over long time-scales, there has been little work done on the factors that shape time to correction, the scale of corrective efforts, and the research waste generated in these endeavours. Similarly, there has been little work done on quantifying factors that might reduce negative impacts of spurious science. This work takes a modeling approach to illuminate these questions, uncovering new strategies for mitigating the impact of untrustworthy research.",

    "abstract": "Thermal sensitivity is not uniform across the skin, and is particularly high in small ([~]1mm2) regions termed  thermosensitive spots. These spots are thought to reflect the anatomical location of specialised thermosensitive nerve endings from single primary afferents. Thermosensitive spots provide foundational support for \"labelled line\" or specificity theory of sensory perception, which state that different sensory qualities are transmitted by separate and specific neural pathways. This theory predicts a highly stable relation between repetitions of a thermal stimulus and the resulting sensory quality, yet these predictions have rarely been tested systematically. Here we present the qualitative, spatial and repeatability properties of 334 thermosensitive spots on the dorsal forearm sampled across 4 separate sessions. In line with previous literature, we found that spots associated with cold sensations (112 cold spots, 34%) were more frequent than spots associated with warm sensations (41 warm spots, 12%). Still more frequent (165 spots, 49%) were spots that elicited inconsistent sensations when repeatedly stimulated by the same temperature. Remarkably, only 13 spots (4%) conserved their position between sessions. Overall, we show unexpected inconsistency of both the perceptual responses elicited by spot stimulation and of spot locations across time. These observations challenge the traditional view that thermosensitive spots reflect the location of individual thermosensitive primary afferents serving as specific labelled lines for corresponding sensory qualities.\n\nNew & NoteworthyThermosensitive spots are clustered rather than randomly distributed, and have highest density near the wrist. Surprisingly, we found that thermosensitive spots elicit inconsistent sensory qualities and are unstable over time. Our results question the widely believed notion that thermosensitive spots reflect the location of individual thermoreceptive primary afferents, that serve as labelled lines for corresponding sensory qualities.",

    "abstract": "The role of gamma rhythm (30-80 Hz) in visual processing is debated; stimuli like gratings and hue patches generate strong gamma, but many natural images do not. Could image gamma responses be predicted by approximating images as gratings or hue patches? Surprisingly, this question remains unanswered, since the joint dependance of gamma on multiple features is poorly understood. We recorded local field potentials and electrocorticogram from two monkeys while presenting natural images and parametric stimuli varying along several feature dimensions. Gamma responses to different grating/hue features were separable, allowing for a multiplicative model based on individual features. By fitting a hue patch to the image around the receptive field, this simple model could predict gamma responses to chromatic images across scales with reasonably high accuracy. Our results provide a simple \"baseline\" model to predict gamma from local image properties, against which more complex models of natural vision can be tested.",

    "abstract": "The global rise of antibiotic resistance calls for new drugs against bacterial pathogens. A common approach is to search for natural compounds deployed by microbes to inhibit competitors. Here we show that the iron chelating pyoverdines, siderophores produced by environmental Pseudomonas spp., have strong antibacterial properties by inducing iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens. A screen of 320 natural Pseudomonas isolates used against 12 human pathogens uncovered five pyoverdines with particularly high antibacterial properties and distinct chemical characteristics. The most potent pyoverdine effectively reduced growth of the pathogens Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus in a concentration- and iron-dependent manner. Pyoverdine increased survival of infected Galleria mellonella host larvae, and showed low toxicity for the host, mammalian cell lines, and erythrocytes. Furthermore, experimental evolution combined with whole-genome sequencing revealed reduced potentials for resistance evolution compared to an antibiotic. Thus, pyoverdines from environmental strains could become new sustainable antibacterials against human pathogens.",

Significant differences in the structural composition of the two groups were observed. In both Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum in majority of the samples. B/F ratio was consistently <1 in all diarrheal samples. Significant difference in mean B/F ratio of the two groups was found. Proteobacteria was significantly more abundant in the diarrheal group. Prevotellaceae was the most abundant family in non-diarrheal samples and was suppressed significantly in diarrheal samples. Streptococcaceae was the most abundant family in 60% diarrheal samples and where Streptococcaceae was suppressed, Bacteroideaceae and Nocardeaceae were the most abundant. In non-diarrheal samples where Streptococcaceae was almost completely suppressed Bifidobacteriaceae was the most abundant and suppressed other families significantly. A negative correlation was observed between Prevotellaceae and Bacteroideaceae in the non-diarrheal group. Prevotella copri was the most abundant species in 70% non-diarrheal samples and was significantly suppressed in diarrheal samples. Proteus mirabilis was identified in all the non-diarrheal samples while they were absent in diarrheal samples. The OTUs associated with diarrheal dysbiosis can serve as prognostic markers. This is the first report on the comparative analysis of diarrheal and non-diarrheal microbiome, to our knowledge, and distinctly addressing the gut microbiome dysbiosis from the context that can lead to the development of prognostic markers and probiotics for protecting the endemic population from diarrhea.",

    "abstract": "The development of the infant gut microbiome is primarily influenced by the infant feeding type, with breast milk serving as the optimal source of nutrition. Breast milk contains human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) that act as nourishment for the developing gut microbiome, potentially conferring advantages to specific bacterial species. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of certain Bifidobacterium species to utilize individual HMOs, however a longitudinal study examining the evolving microbial community at a high resolution in the context of mothers milk HMO composition is lacking. Here, we explored the relationship between the HMO composition in mothers milk and the abundance of Bifidobacterium species in the infant gut throughout the course of early life. To enable subspecies taxonomic classification, we developed a high-throughput method for quantifying the abundance of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis (BL. infantis; the best known HMO-utilizer) from metagenomic sequencing. We applied this method to a longitudinal cohort consisting of 21 mother-infant dyads, from whom we collected matched breast milk and infant stool samples at multiple time points during the first year of life. We observed substantial changes in the infant gut microbiome over the course of several months, while the HMO composition in mothers milk remained relatively stable. Bifidobacterium species were a prominent factor contributing to the variation observed among samples; however, no significant associations were found between specific HMOs in mothers milk and the abundance of Bifidobacterium species. Finally, the longitudinal nature of our cohort enabled us to characterize the dynamic colonization of BL. infantis in the infant gut, which surprisingly began late in the breastfeeding period. Applying our BL. infantis quantification method to additional datasets from various geographical locations, we found similar, late-colonization by BL. infantis, highlighting the importance of quantifying BL. infantis in the infant gut.",

    "abstract": "Massive sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene has become a standard first step to describe and compare microbial communities from various samples. Parallel analysis of high numbers of samples makes it relevant to the statistical testing of the influence of natural or experimental factors and variables. However, these descriptions fail to document changes in community or ecosystem functioning. Non-targeted metabolomics are a suitable tool to bridge this gap, yet extractions protocols are different. In this study, prokaryotic community compositions are documented by 16S rRNA sequencing after direct DNA extraction, or after metabolites extraction followed by DNA extraction. Results obtained using the V3-V4 region on non-axenic cultures of cyanobacteria, lake water column, biofilm, gut of wild and lab-reared fish, indicate that prior extraction of metabolites does not influence the obtained image of prokaryotic communities. This validates sequential extraction of metabolites followed by DNA as a way to combine 16S rRNA sequencing with metabolome characterization from a single sample. This approach has the potential to complement community structure characterization with a proxy of their functioning, without the uncertainties associated with the use of separate samples.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is a leading global cause of death from infectious disease. Biofilms are increasingly recognized as a relevant growth form during M. tb infection and may impede treatment by enabling bacterial drug and immune tolerance. M. tb has a complicated regulatory network that has been well-characterized for many relevant disease states, including dormancy and hypoxia. However, despite its importance, our knowledge of the genes and pathways involved in biofilm formation is limited. Here we characterize the biofilm transcriptomes of fully virulent clinical isolates and find that the regulatory systems underlying biofilm growth vary widely between strains and are also distinct from regulatory programs associated with other environmental cues. We used experimental evolution to investigate changes to the transcriptome during adaptation to biofilm growth and found that the application of a uniform selection pressure resulted in loss of strain-to-strain variation in gene expression, resulting in a more uniform biofilm transcriptome. The adaptive trajectories of transcriptomes were shaped by the genetic background of the M. tb population leading to convergence on a sub-lineage specific transcriptome. We identified widespread upregulation of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) as a common feature of the biofilm transcriptome and hypothesize that ncRNA function in genome-wide modulation of gene expression, thereby facilitating rapid regulatory responses to new environments. These results reveal a new facet of the M. tb regulatory system and provide valuable insight into how M. tb adapts to new environments.\n\nImportanceUnderstanding mechanisms of resistance and tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) can help us develop new treatments that capitalize on M. tbs vulnerabilities. Here we used transcriptomics to study both the regulation of biofilm formation in clinical isolates as well as how those regulatory systems adapt to new environments. We find that closely related clinical populations have diverse strategies for growth under biofilm conditions, and that genetic background plays a large role in determining the trajectory of evolution. These results have implications for future treatment strategies that may be informed by our knowledge of the evolutionary constraints on strain(s) from an individual infection. This work provides new information about the mechanisms of biofilm formation in M. tb and outlines a framework for population level approaches for studying bacterial adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Insights into single cell expression data are generally collected through well conserved biological markers that separate cells into known and unknown populations. Unfortunately for non-model organisms that lack known markers, it is often impossible to partition cells into biologically relevant clusters which hinders analysis into the species. Tribolium castaneum, the red flour beetle, lacks known markers for spermatogenesis found in insect species like Drosophila melanogaster. Using single cell sequencing data collected from adult beetle testes, we implement a strategy for elucidating biologically meaningful cell populations by using transient expression stage identification markers, weighted principal component leiden clustering. We identify populations that correspond to observable points in sperm differentiation and find species specific markers for each stage. We also develop an innovative method to differentiate diploid from haploid cells based on scRNA-Seq reads and use it to corroborate our predicted demarcation of meiotic cell stages. Our results demonstrate that molecular pathways underlying spermatogenesis in Coleoptera are highly diverged from those in Diptera, relying on several genes with female meiotic pathway annotations. We find that the X chromosome is almost completely silenced throughout pre-meiotic and meiotic cells. Further evidence suggests that machinery homologous to the Drosophila dosage compensation complex (DCC) may mediate escape from meiotic sex chromosome inactivation and postmeiotic reactivation of the X chromosome.",

This study covers the development and validation of two duplex taqman qPCR assays used to target four markers on the chromosome of genospecies of B. burgdorferi s. l..\n\nAnalytical specificity was determined with a panel of spirochete strains. qPCR characteristics were specified using water or tick DNA spiked with controlled quantities of the targeted DNA sequences of B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto or B. bavariensis. The effectiveness of detection results was finally evaluated using DNA extracted from ticks and biopsies from mammals whose infectious status had been determined by other detection assays.\n\nThe developed qPCR assays allow exclusive detection of B. burgdorferi s. l. with the exception of the M16 marker which also detect relapsing fever Borrelia species. The limit of detection is between 10 and 40 copies per qPCR reaction depending on the sample type, the B. burgdorferi genospecies and the targeted marker. Detection tests performed on various kind of samples illustrated the accuracy and robustness of our qPCR assays.\n\nWithin the defined limits, this multi-target qPCR method allows a versatile detection of B. burgdorferi s. l., regardless of the genospecies and the sample material analyzed, with a sensitivity that would be compatible with most applications and a reproducibility of 100% under measurement conditions and limits of detection, thereby limiting result ambiguities.\n\nHighlightsFour qPCR assays used in duplex were developed to detect Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato.

    "abstract": "RationaleEndothelial cells can differentiate into mesenchymal-like cells via endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). In murine models, cell transitions of EndoMT have been assessed with lineage tracing techniques. Knowledge on molecular mechanisms of EndoMT in human vascular lesions is scarce as studies in human atherosclerosis are limited by observational study designs such as histo-pathological studies.\n\nObjectiveWe aim to identify a human EndoMT gene expression signature by combining experimentally induced in vitro EndoMT with lineage-traced pathways from atherosclerotic mice and extrapolate this to human plaque scRNA-seq data.\n\nMethods and resultsFirst, we stimulated human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) with TNF and TFG{beta} to trigger EndoMT. We executed transcriptomic analyses and defined multiple temporal patterns of gene expression changes during EndoMT. We used Cdh5-CreERT2 Rosa-eYFP apoE-/- lineage traced mouse scRNA-seq data to demonstrate that the temporal in vitro gene expression changes are reflected in EndoMT trajectories in mice plaque tissue. Finally, we constructed three candidate EndoMT lineages across multiple subpopulations of ECs and SMCs in human carotid scRNA-seq data (n=46). We examined gene expression over the course of these lineages and identified 73 markers for the presence of EndoMT such as NRG1 and DEPP1.\n\nConclusionThis study reveals the gene expression profile of EndoMT trajectories in human atherosclerotic plaques by combining RNA-seq data from in vitro models with single-cell transcriptomic datasets. Our gene expression atlas of EndoMT in atherosclerosis could serve as a reference for future studies, providing novel inroads to study atherosclerotic mechanisms for the development of novel therapies.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms enabling genetically identical cells to differentially regulate gene expression are complex and central to organismal development and evolution. While gene silencing pathways involving sequence-specific recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes are prevalent in nature, examples of sequence-independent heritable gene silencing are scarce. Studies of Schizosaccharomyces pombe indicate that sequence-independent propagation of heterochromatin can occur but requires numerous multisubunit protein complexes and their various activities. Such complexity has precluded a coherent articulation of the minimal requirements for heritable gene silencing by conventional approaches. Here, we take an unconventional approach to defining these requirements by engineering sequence-independent silent chromatin inheritance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The memory-conferring mechanism is remarkably simple and requires only two proteins, one that recognizes histone H3 methylation and deacetylates histone H4, and another that recognizes unmodified H4 and catalyzes H3 methylation. These bilingual \"read-write\" proteins form an interdependent positive feedback loop capable of transmitting sequence-independent silent information over multiple generations.",

    "abstract": "A key goal of evolutionary genomics is to harness molecular data to draw inferences about selective forces that have acted on genomes. The field progresses in large part through the development and benchmarking of advanced molecular-evolution analysis methods. Here we evaluated the rigor and performance of a test of directional, cis-regulatory evolution across genes in pathways, using stem cells from Mus musculus subspecies as a model. We discovered a unique program of induction of ribosomal large-subunit genes in stem cells of the Southeast Asian mouse M. m. castaneus relative to its sister taxa, driven in part by cis-regulatory variation. As a complement, we used sequence analyses to find population- and comparative-genomic signatures of selection in M. m. castaneus, at the upstream regions of the ribosomal gene cohort. The unique high-expression program for these loci in M. m. castaneus was recapitulated in stem cell-derived neurons. We interpret our data under a model of changes in lineage-specific pressures across Mus musculus in stem cells with high translational capacity. Together, our findings underscore the rigor of integrating expression and sequence-based methods to generate hypotheses about evolutionary events from long ago.",

    "abstract": "Planctomycetes bacteria are ubiquitously distributed across various biospheres and play key roles in global element cycles. However, few deep-sea Planctomycetes members have been cultivated, limiting our understanding of Planctomycetes in the deep biosphere. Here, we have successfully cultured a novel strain of Planctomycetes (strain ZRK32) from a cold seep sediment, by using an enriched medium supplemented with rifampicin and different nitrogen sources. Our genomic, physiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate that strain ZRK32 is a novel species, which we propose be named: Poriferisphaera heterotrophicis. We show that strain ZRK32 replicates using a budding mode of division. Based on the combined results from growth assays and transcriptomic analyses, we found that rich nutrients, or supplementation with NO3- or NH4+ promoted the growth of strain ZRK32 by facilitating energy production through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) glycolysis pathway. Moreover, supplementation with NO3- or NH4+ induced strain ZRK32 to release a bacteriophage in a chronic manner, without host cell lysis. This bacteriophage then enabled strain ZRK32, and another marine bacterium that we studied, to metabolize nitrogen through the function of auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs). Overall, these findings expand our understanding of deep-sea Planctomycetes bacteria, while highlighting their ability to metabolize nitrogen when reprogrammed by chronic viruses.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a facultative intracellular pathogen that utilizes its type III secretion systems (T3SSs) to inject virulence factors into the host cell and colonize the host. In turn, a subset of cytosolic immune receptors respond to T3SS ligands by forming multimeric signaling complexes called inflammasomes, which activate caspases that induce interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokine release and an inflammatory form of cell death called pyroptosis. Human macrophages mount a multifaceted inflammasome response to Salmonella infection that ultimately restricts intracellular bacterial replication. However, how inflammasomes restrict Salmonella replication remains unknown. We find that caspase-1 is essential for mediating inflammasome responses to Salmonella and subsequent restriction of bacterial replication within human macrophages, with caspase-4 contributing as well. We also demonstrate that the downstream pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) and ninjurin-1 (NINJ1), a mediator of terminal cell lysis, play a role in controlling Salmonella replication in human macrophages. Notably, in the absence of inflammasome responses, we observed hyperreplication of Salmonella within the cytosol of infected cells, and we also observed increased bacterial replication within vacuoles, suggesting that inflammasomes control Salmonella replication primarily within the cytosol and also within vacuoles. These findings reveal that inflammatory caspases and pyroptotic factors mediate inflammasome responses that restrict the subcellular localization of intracellular Salmonella replication within human macrophages.",

    "abstract": "Multidrug efflux pumps are the frontline defense mechanisms of Gram-negative bacteria, yet little is known of their relative fitness tradeoffs under gut conditions such as low pH and the presence of antimicrobial food molecules. Low pH is important as it contributes to the proton-motive force (PMF) that drives most efflux pumps. We show how the PMF-dependent pumps AcrAB-TolC, MdtEF-TolC, and EmrAB-TolC undergo selection at low pH and in the presence of membrane-permeant phytochemicals. Competition assays were performed by flow cytometry of co-cultured Escherichia coli K-12 strains possessing or lacking a given pump complex. All three pumps showed negative selection under conditions that deplete PMF (pH 5.5 with CCCP, or at pH 8.0). At pH 5.5, selection against AcrAB-TolC was increased by aromatic acids, alcohols, and related phytochemicals such as methyl salicylate. The degree of fitness cost for AcrA was correlated with the phytochemicals lipophilicity (logP). MdtEF-TolC and EmrAB-TolC each conferred a fitness cost at pH 5.5, but salicylate and benzoate conferred a net positive fitness contribution for the pump. Expression of pump genes was measured by digital PCR. Between pH 5.5 - 8.0, acrA and emrA were upregulated in log phase, whereas mdtE expression was upregulated in transition-to-stationary phase and at pH 5.5 in log phase. Methyl salicylate did not affect pump gene expression, despite selecting against AcrAB-TolC. Our results suggest that lipophilic non-acidic molecules select against a major efflux pump without positive section for others.\n\nIMPORTANCEFor drugs that are administered orally, we need to understand how ingested phytochemicals modulate intrinsic drug resistance in our gut microbiome. Intrinsic drug resistance of bacteria is mediated by PMF-driven pumps that efflux many different antibiotics and cell waste products. These pumps play a key role in bacterial defense by conferring low-level resistance to antimicrobial agents at first exposure, while providing time for a pathogen to evolve resistance to higher levels of the antibiotic exposed. Nevertheless, efflux pumps confer energetic costs due to gene expression and pump energy expense. The bacterial PMF includes the transmembrane pH difference ({Delta}pH) which may be depleted by permeant acids and membrane disruptors. Understanding the fitness costs of efflux pumps may enable us to develop resistance breakers, that is, molecules that work together with antibiotics to potentiate their effect. We show that different pumps have distinct selection criteria, and we identified non-acidic aromatic molecules as promising candidates for drug resistance breakers.",

Here, we screened 720 fluorescent soil isolates for their effects on Bacillus subtilis pellicle formation in two types of media and found a predictor for interaction outcome in Pseudomonas taxonomy. Interactions were context-dependent and both medium composition and culture conditions strongly influenced interactions. Negative interactions were associated with Pseudomonas capeferrum, Pseudomonas entomophila and Pseudomonas protegens, and 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol was confirmed as a strong (but not exclusive) inhibitor of B. subtilis. Non-inhibiting strains were closely related to Pseudomonas trivialis and Pseudomonas lini, but in this case, cocultures with increased B. subtilis pellicle formation were spatially segregated. Our study is the first to propose an overall negative outcome from pairwise interactions between B. subtilis and fluorescent pseudomonads, hence cocultures comprising members from these groups are likely to require additional microorganisms for coexistence.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) alleviation warrants antimicrobial stewardship (AS) entailing indispensability of epidemiological surveillance. We undertook a small-scale surveillance in Kolkata to detect the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the healthy gut microbiome. We found that it was a reservoir of ARGs against common antibiotics. A targeted PCR and sequencing-based ARGs detection against tetracyclines, macrolides, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, aminoglycosides, amphenicol and mobile genetic element (MGE) markers was deployed in twenty-five fecal samples. Relative abundance and frequency of ARGs was calculated. We detected markers against all these classes of antibiotics. 100% samples carried aminoglycoside resistance marker and int1U. A comparison with our previously published diarrheal resistome from the same spatial and temporal frame revealed that a higher diversity of ARGs were detected in the community and a higher rate of isolation of tetC, msrA, tmp and sul-2 was found. The presence of common markers in the two cohorts proves that the gut microbiome has been contaminated with ARGs and which are being disseminated among different ecosystems. This is an issue of discerning concern for public health. The study raises an alarming picture of the AMR crisis in low-middle and emergent economies. It emphasizes the strict enforcement of AS in the community.",

Our study unveiled a unique mechanical force-based strategy, employed by VCP/p97, an AAA-ATPase, which by extracting ubiquitinated bacterial surface proteins, eliminates pathogens. Using molecular dynamic simulation along with in-vitro and ex-vivo experiments, we demonstrated that p97s segregase activity is central to its bactericidal effect. Assisted by cofactors NPLOC4 and UFD1, p97 causes extensive lysis of phylogenetically diverse microbes and triggers leaching of bacterial cytosolic contents. In-vivo, p97 abrogated bacterial proliferation in host tissues and protected animals from lethal infections. Overall, we unravelled a distinct innate immune function of p97, which is critical for host protection against bacterial infections.",

However, only few phage satellites have been characterized, and mechanisms by which they influence microbial evolution in nature are unclear. Here we identify a new family of satellites, the Phage Inducible Chromosomal Minimalist Island (PICMI), which is broadly distributed in the marine bacteria Vibrionaceae. PICMI is characterized by reduced gene content, does not encode genes for capsid remodeling and packages its DNA as a concatemer. PICMI is integrated in the bacterial host genome at the end of the fis regulator and encodes three core proteins necessary for excision and replication. PICMI is dependent on virulent phage particles to spread to other bacteria and confers host protection from other competitive phages, without interfering with its helper phage. The discovery of PICMI strongly suggests that phages, including virulent ones, play important roles for mobility of phage defense elements.",

However, it was recently proposed that latent virus is also present in immune cells recovered from ganglia in a mouse model used for studying latency. Here, we reanalyzed the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data that formed the basis for this conclusion. Unexpectedly, off-target priming in 3 scRNA-Seq experiments enabled the detection of non-polyadenylated HSV-1 latency-associated transcript (LAT) intronic RNAs. However, LAT reads were near-exclusively detected in a mixed population of cells undergoing cell death. Specific loss of HSV-1 LAT and neuronal transcripts during quality control filtering indicated widespread destruction of neurons, supporting the presence of contaminating cell-free RNA in other cells following tissue processing. In conclusion, the reported detection of latent HSV-1 in non-neuronal cells is best explained by inaccuracies in the data analyses.",

    "abstract": "The hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A protein is comprised of three domains (D1-3). Previously, we observed that two alanine substitutions in D1 (V67A, P145A) abrogated replication of a genotype 2a (JFH-1 isolate) sub-genomic replicon (SGR) in Huh7 cells, but this phenotype was partially restored in Huh7.5 cells. To investigate the mechanism of this difference we extended this analysis to demonstrate that 5 additional residues, surface exposed and proximal to either V67 or P145, exhibited the same phenotype. In contrast, these mutants in a genotype 3a (DBN3a isolate) SGR retained their phenotype in each cell line.\n\nThe difference between Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells was reminiscent of the observation that cyclophilin (Cyp) inhibitors are more potent against HCV replication in the former and suggested a role for D1 in Cyp dependence. Consistent with this, all JFH-1 and DBN3a mutants exhibited increased sensitivity to cyclosporin A treatment compared to wildtype. Silencing of CypA in Huh7 cells inhibited replication of both JFH-1 and DBN3a. However, in Huh7.5 cells CypA silencing did not inhibit JFH-1 wildtype, but abrogated replication of all the JFH-1 mutants, and both DBN3a wildtype and all mutants. CypB silencing in Huh7 cells had no effect on DBN3a, but abrogated replication of JFH-1. CypB silencing in Huh7.5 cells had no effect on either SGR. These data demonstrate both a direct involvement of NS5A D1 in Cyp-dependent genome replication and functional differences between genotype 2 and 3 NS5A. Lastly, we confirmed that JFH-1 NS5A D1 interacted with CypA in vitro.",

Our analysis also revealed that alternative TSS usage regulation in response to environmental cues is widespread in Cryptococcus, altering gene expression and protein targeting. Importantly, we performed a forward genetic screen to identify a unique transcription factor (TF) named Tur1, which regulates alternative TSS (altTSS) usage genome-wide when cells switch from exponential phase to stationary phase. Tur1 has been previously shown to be essential for virulence in C. neoformans.

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) is a highly conserved mechanism that allows to expand the coding capacity of the genome by modifying how multiple isoforms are expressed or used to generate different phenotypes. Despite its importance in physiology and disease, genome-wide studies of AS are lacking in most insects, including mosquitoes. And, even for model organisms, chromatin associated processes involved in the regulation AS are poorly known. In this study, we investigated AS in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae in the context tissue-specific gene expression and mosquito responses to a Plasmodium falciparum infection, as well as the relationship between patterns of differential isoform expression and usage with chromatin accessibility changes. For this, we combined RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data from A. gambiae midguts and salivary glands, and from infected and non-infected midguts. We report differences between tissues in the expression of 456 isoforms and in the use of 211 isoforms, highlighting the role of AS in tissue-specific gene expression regulation. Secondly, we find a clear and significant association between chromatin accessibility states and tissue-specific patterns of AS. The analysis of differential accessible regions located at splicing sites permitted the identification of several motifs resembling the binding sites of Drosophila TFs potentially involved in mosquito AS regulation. Finally, the genome-wide analysis of tissue-dependent enhancer activity revealed that approximately 20% of A. gambiae transcriptional enhancers annotate to a differentially expressed or used isoform and that their activation status is linked to AS differences between tissues. This research illuminates the role of AS in gene expression in vector mosquitoes, and identifies regulatory regions potentially involved in AS regulation, which could reveal novel strategies for vector control.",

    "abstract": "Bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) proteins and histone deacetylases (HDACs) are prime targets in cancer therapy. Recent research has particularly focused on the development of dual BET/HDAC inhibitors for hard-to-treat tumors such as pancreatic cancer. Here, we have developed a new series of potent dual BET/HDAC inhibitors by choosing starting scaffolds that enabled us to optimally merge the two functionalities into a single compound. Systematic structure-guided modification of both warheads then led to optimized binders that were superior in potency to both parent compounds, with the best molecules of this series binding to both BRD4 bromodomains as well as HDAC1/2 with EC50 values in the 100-nanomolar range in cellular NanoBRET target engagement assays. Importantly, this on-target activity also translated into promising efficacy in pancreatic cancer and NUT midline carcinoma cells. Our lead molecules effectively blocked histone H3 deacetylation in pancreatic cancer cells and upregulated the tumor suppressor HEXIM1 and proapoptotic p57, both markers of BET inhibition. In addition, they have the potential to downregulate oncogenic drivers of NUT midline carcinoma, as demonstrated for MYC and TP63 mRNA levels. Overall, this study expands the portfolio of available dual BET/class I HDAC inhibitors for future translational studies in different cancer models.",

    "abstract": "Here, we construct genome-scale maps for R-loops, three-stranded nucleic acid structures comprised of a DNA/RNA hybrid and a displaced single strand of DNA, in the proliferative and differentiated zones of the human prenatal brain. We show that R-loops are abundant in the progenitor-rich germinal matrix, with preferential formation at promoters slated for upregulated expression at later stages of differentiation, including numerous neurodevelopmental risk genes. RNase H1-mediated contraction of the genomic R-loop space in neural progenitors shifted differentiation toward the neuronal lineage and was associated with transcriptomic alterations and defective functional and structural neuronal connectivity in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, R- loops are important for fine-tuning differentiation-sensitive gene expression programs of neural progenitor cells.",

    "abstract": "Systemic toxicity is a major challenge to therapeutic development, consequently, cell-type specific targeting is highly desirable to improve on-target cell efficacy while reducing off-target toxicity. Here, we describe a cell targeting system we called BRAID (BRidged Activation by Intra/intermolecular Division) where an active molecule is divided into two inactive or less active parts that are subsequently brought together via a bridging receptor on target cell. We tested this hypothesis using WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling system and demonstrated that a multivalent WNT agonist molecule divided into two inactive components induced signaling specifically on hepatocytes assembled via two different epitopes on a hepatocyte receptor, {beta}Klotho. These data provided proof-of-concept for a cell specific targeting approach and also demonstrated the feasibility of combining different signaling pathways where desirable. This approach has broad applications to other receptor systems.",
