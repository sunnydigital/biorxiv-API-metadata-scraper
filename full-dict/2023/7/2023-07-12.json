    "abstract": "Unicellular green algae of the genus Coccomyxa are recognized for their worldwide distribution and ecological versatility. Most species described to date live in close association with various host species, such as in lichen associations. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that drive such symbiotic lifestyles. We generated a high-quality genome assembly for the lichen photobiont Coccomyxa viridis SAG 216-4 (formerly C. mucigena). Using long-read PacBio HiFi and Oxford Nanopore Technologies in combination with chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) sequencing, we assembled the genome into 21 scaffolds with a total length of 50.9 Mb, an N50 of 2.7 Mb and a BUSCO score of 98.6%. While nineteen scaffolds represent full-length nuclear chromosomes, two additional scaffolds represent the mitochondrial and plastid genomes. Transcriptome-guided gene annotation resulted in the identification of 13,557 protein-coding genes, of which 68% have annotated PFAM domains and 962 are predicted to be secreted.",

    "abstract": "Reduction oxidation (redox) reactions are central in life and altered redox state is associated with a spectrum of human diseases. Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant antioxidant in eukaryotic cells and plays critical roles in maintaining redox homeostasis. Thus, measuring intracellular GSH level is an important method to assess the redox state of organism. The currently available GSH probes are based on irreversible chemical reactions with glutathione and cant monitor the real-time glutathione dynamics. Our group developed the first reversible reaction based fluorescent probe for glutathione, which can measure glutathione levels at high resolution using a confocal microscope and in the bulk scale with a flow cytometry. Most importantly it can quantitatively monitor the real-time GSH dynamics in living cells. Using the 2nd generation of GSH probe, RealThiol (RT), this study measured the GSH level in living Hela cells after treatment with varying concentrations of DL-Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) which inhibits GSH synthesis, using a high throughput imaging system, Cytation 5 cell imaging reader. The results revealed that GSH probe RT at the concentration of 2.0 {micro}M accurately monitored the BSO treatment effect on GSH level in the Hela cells. The present results demonstrated that the GSH probe RT is sensitive and precise in GSH measurement in living cells at a high throughput imaging platform and has the potential to be applied to any cell lines.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the most common metabolic disorders worldwide without effective treatments. Lysosomal acidification impairment, autophagy defect, and mitochondrial dysfunction all associate with T2D, although the exact pathogenic mechanisms remain under investigation. Here, we report a series of biodegradable poly(butylene tetrafluorosuccinate-co-succinate) (PBFSU) polyesters consisting of an 1,4-butanediol linker and varying ratios of tetrafluorosuccinic acid (TFSA) and succinic acid (SA) as component acids to engineer new lysosome acidifying nanoparticles (NPs). The TFSA component significantly modulates the degradation rate and acidification capability of the PBFSU NPs, where NPs consisting entirely of TFSA, which we termed TFSA NPs, re-acidify impaired lysosomes with the strongest reduction in luminal pH. Further, we show that in both mRNA expression of human T2D pancreatic islets and protein expression in INS-1 {beta}-cells under lipotoxic condition that there is a significant downregulation of genes associated with lysosomal vacuolar (H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) subunits responsible for maintaining lysosomal acidification. Treatment of TFSA NPs mediates palmitate-induced lipotoxicity in INS-1 {beta}-cells by restoring lysosomal acidification, autophagic function, and mitochondria functions, as well as promoting glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Administration of TFSA NPs to high-fat diet T2D mice improves glucose clearance and reduces insulin resistance. Together, the data document the therapeutic potential of lysosome acidifying TFSA NPs for T2D.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=168 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/548395v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@72862org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ec7884org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dc5976org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1758c60_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Cancers result from aberrations in cellular signaling systems, typically resulting from driver somatic genome alterations (SGAs) in individual tumors. Precision oncology requires understanding the cellular state and selecting medications that induce vulnerability in cancer cells under such conditions. To this end, we developed a computational framework consisting of two components: 1) A representation-learning component, which learns a representation of the cellular signaling systems when perturbed by SGAs, using a biologically-motivated and interpretable deep learning model. 2) A drug-response-prediction component, which predicts the response to drugs by leveraging the information of the cellular state of the cancer cells derived by the first component. Our cell-state-oriented framework significantly enhances the accuracy of genome-informed prediction of drug responses in comparison to models that directly use SGAs as inputs. Importantly, our framework enables the prediction of response to chemotherapy agents based on SGAs, thus expanding genome-informed precision oncology beyond molecularly targeted drugs.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSimulating sequence evolution plays an important role in the development and evaluation of phylogenetic inference tools. Naturally, the simulated data needs to be as realistic as possible to be indicative of the performance of the developed tools on empirical data. Over the years, numerous phylogenetic sequence simulators, employing various models of evolution, have been published with the goal to simulate such empirical-like data. In this study, we simulated DNA and protein Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) under increasingly complex models of evolution with and without insertion/deletion (indel) events using a state-of-the-art sequence simulator. We assessed their realism by quantifying how well supervised learning methods are able to predict whether a given MSA is simulated or empirical.\n\nResultsOur results show that we can distinguish between empirical and simulated MSAs with high accuracy using two distinct and independently developed classification approaches across all tested models of sequence evolution. Our findings suggest that the current state-of-the-art models fail to accurately replicate the process of evolution.\n\nData and Code AvailabilityAll simulated and empirical MSAs, as well as all analysis results, are available at https://cme.h-its.org/exelixis/material/simulation_study.tar.gz.

    "abstract": "The intracellular liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of biomolecules gives rise to condensates that act as membrane-less organelles with vital functions. FUS, an RNA-binding protein, natively forms condensates through LLPS and further provides a model system for the often disease-linked liquid-to-solid transition of biomolecular condensates during aging. However, the mechanism of such maturation processes, as well as the structural and physical properties of the system, remain unclear, partly attributable to difficulties in resolving the internal structures of the micrometer-sized condensates with diffraction-limited optical microscopy. Harnessing a set of multidimensional super-resolution microscopy tools that uniquely map out local physicochemical parameters through single-molecule spectroscopy, here we uncover nanoscale heterogeneities in the aging process of FUS condensates. Through spectrally resolved single-molecule localization microscopy (SR-SMLM) with a solvatochromic dye, we unveil distinct hydrophobic nanodomains at the condensate surface. Through SMLM with a fluorogenic amyloid probe, we identify these nanodomains as amyloid aggregates. Through single-molecule displacement/diffusivity mapping (SMdM), we show that such nanoaggregates drastically impede local diffusion. Notably, upon aging or mechanical shears, these nanoaggregates progressively expand on the condensate surface, thus leading to a growing low-diffusivity shell while leaving the condensate interior diffusion-permitting. Together, beyond uncovering fascinating nanoscale structural arrangements and aging mechanisms in the single-component FUS condensates, the demonstrated synergy of multidimensional super-resolution approaches in this study opens new paths for understanding LLPS systems.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDOncolytic adenoviruses, such as Delta-24-RGD, show promise as a potential breakthrough in treating patients with high-grade gliomas. However, their effectiveness against gliomas can be hindered by the presence of neutralizing antibodies.\n\nMETHODSProduction of human neutralizing antibodies against adenoviruses was assessed in two cohorts of patients with malignant gliomas treated with Delta-24-RGD in a phase 1 clinical trial. Sera containing neutralizing antibodies were also obtained from mice immunized with intramuscular injections of wild-type Ad5. Chimeric adenovirus was constructed using molecular cloning, and its activity was assessed in vitro using quantitative PCR, western blot, and transmission electron microscopy. The therapeutic efficacy of the chimeric virus was tested in vivo using sera from patients previously treated with Delta-24-RGD and immunocompetent murine models of glioma.\n\nRESULTSExamination of sera from patients with malignant gliomas treated with Delta-24-RGD revealed that in the cohort treated with multiple injections of this oncolytic adenovirus, a higher percentage of patients developed neutralizing antibodies when compared to the patients treated with a single injection of Delta-24-RGD. Of note, long-term survival was only observed in patients who received a single injection. Delta-24-RGD-H43m, a chimeric oncolytic adenovirus engineered to overcome virus neutralization, demonstrated a potent anti-glioma effect both in vitro and in vivo. This chimeric virus showed resilience against anti-Ad5 neutralizing antibodies and conferred better therapeutic efficacy compared to Delta-24-RGD in mice with immunity against Ad5. Of further clinical relevance, Delta-24-RGD-H43m also evaded the inhibitory effects of sera from human patients treated with Delta-24-RGD.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThe development of neutralizing antibodies due to multiple virus injections was associated with lower frequency of long-term survivors in a clinical trial. The new chimeric virus shows increased resilience to inactivation by the sera of human patients compared to the parental virus. These findings lay the foundation for a novel oncolytic virus treatment approach targeting a significant percentage of glioma patients with prior exposure to adenovirus.",

Here we report that the Ca2+-sensitive luminescent protein aequorin does not reconstitute with its cofactor at highly acidic pH but that a significant fraction of the probe is functional within a mildly acidic compartment when targeted to the endo-lysosomal system. We leveraged this probe (ELGA) to report Ca2+ dynamics in this compartment. We show that Ca2+ uptake is ATP-dependent and sensitive to blockers of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pumps. We find that the Ca2+ mobilizing messenger IP3 which typically targets the endoplasmic reticulum evokes robust luminal responses in wild type cells, but not in IP3 receptor knock-out cells. Responses were comparable to those evoked by activation of the endo-lysosomal ion channel TRPML1. Stimulation with IP3-forming agonists also mobilized the store in intact cells. Our data reveal a physiologically-relevant, IP3-sensitive store of Ca2+ within the endo-lysosomal system.",

This study aims to explore the efficacy of in vitro initiation and cryopreservation of shoot tips as a potential strategy for eradicating strawberry viruses. We tested plants for four important strawberry viruses namely: SMoV, SCV, SMEY and SVBV. The plants, which tested positive were either cultivated as in vitro cultures then returned to a green house or field collection cultivation, or treated by cryopreservation. After cryopreservation, the plants were cultivated again in vitro and then in the green house or field. The viruses were detected within each propagation step. Significant eradication effects were found for SMoV and SCV when plants were treated by in vitro initiation or with cryotherapy, but not for SMEY or SVBV. The results of this study show that cryotherapy or in vitro initiation can lead to the elimination of strawberry viruses, but the kind of therapy appears to depend on the type of virus.",

    "abstract": "Over the last years, several developments of remote webcam-based eye tracking (ET) prototypes have emerged, testing their feasibility and potential for web-based experiments. This growing interest is mainly explained by the possibility to perform tasks remotely, which allows the study of larger and hard-to-reach populations and potential applications in telemedicine. Nevertheless, a decrease in the quality of the camera and a noisier environment bring new implementation challenges. In this study, we present a new prototype of remote webcam-based ET. First, we introduced improvements to the state-of-the-art remote ET prototypes for cognitive and clinical tasks, e.g. without the necessity of constant mouse interactions. Second, we assessed its spatiotemporal resolution and its reliability within an experiment. Third, we ran a classical experiment, the anti-saccade task, to assess its functionality and limitations. This cognitive test compares horizontal eye movements toward (pro-saccades) or away from (anti-saccades) a target, as a measure of inhibitory control. Our results replicated previous findings obtained with high-quality laboratory ETs. Briefly, higher error rates in anti-saccades compared to pro-saccades were observed, and incorrect responses presented faster reaction times. Our web-ET prototype showed a stable calibration over time and performed well in a classic cognitive experiment. Finally, we discussed the potential of this prototype for clinical applications and its limitations for experimental use.",

    "abstract": "The primate visual cortex contains various regions that exhibit specialization for different stimulus properties, such as motion, shape, and color. Within each region there is often further specialization, such that particular stimulus features, such as horizontal and vertical orientations, are overrepresented. These asymmetries are associated with well-known perceptual biases, but little is known about how they influence visual learning. Most theories would predict that learning is optimal, in the sense that it is unaffected by these asymmetries. But other approaches to learning would result in specific patterns of perceptual biases. To distinguish between these possibilities, we trained human observers to discriminate between expanding and contracting motion patterns, which have a highly asymmetrical representation in visual cortex. Observers exhibited biased percepts of these stimuli, and these biases were affected by training in ways that were often suboptimal. We simulated different neural network models and found that a learning rule that involved only adjustments to decision criteria, rather than connection weights, could account for our data. These results suggest that cortical asymmetries influence visual perception and that human observers often rely on suboptimal strategies for learning.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDysregulated reward processing and mood instability are core features of bipolar disorder that have largely been considered separately, and with contradictory findings. We sought to test a mechanistic account that proposes that, in bipolar disorder, there is an excessive tendency to enter recursive cycles in which reward perception is biased by signals that the environment might be changing for the better or worse.\n\nMethodsParticipants completed a probabilistic reward task with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Using an influential computational model, we ascertained whether participants with bipolar disorder (n = 21) show greater striatal tracking of momentum-biased reward prediction errors (RPEs) than healthy controls (n = 21). We conducted psychophysiological interaction analyses to quantify the degree to which each group modulated functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and left anterior insula in response to fluctuations in momentum.\n\nResultsIn the bipolar disorder group, but not controls, the momentum-biased RPE model accounted for significant additional variance in ventral striatal activity beyond a standard mode of veridical RPEs. Compared to controls, the bipolar disorder group exhibited lower ventral striatal-left insular functional connectivity modulated by momentum-biased RPE. Moreover, this reduction in connectivity was more pronounced as a function of current manic symptoms.\n\nConclusionsConsistent with an existing theory, we found evidence that bipolar disorder is associated with a tendency for momentum to excessively bias striatal tracking of RPE signals. We identify impaired striatal-insular connectivity as a possible locus for this propensity. We argue that computational psychiatric approaches that examine momentary shifts in reward and mood dynamics have strong potential for new mechanistic insights and targets for intervention.",

We also evaluated if serum levels of neurofilament light (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), blood-based biomarkers of disease severity in human PD, were affected.\n\nMethodsWe used a 6-OHDA hemiparkinson rat model featuring progressive nigrostriatal neuron loss over 28 days, with impaired forelimb use 7 days post-lesion, and hypokinesia onset 21 days post-lesion. After establishing forelimb use deficits, moderate intensity AE began 1-3 days later, 3x per week, for 40 min/session.

Despite severe DA loss, recovery of forelimb use deficits and alleviation of hypokinesia progression began after 2 weeks of AE and was maintained. Increased NfLand GFAP levels from lesion were reduced by AE. Despite these AE-driven changes, striatal DA tissue and TH protein levels were unaffected.\n\nConclusionsThis proof-of-concept study shows AE, using exercise parameters within the capabilities most PD patients, promotes recovery of established motor deficits in a rodent PD model, concomitant with reduced levels of blood-based biomarkers associated with PD severity, without commensurate increase in striatal DA or TH protein.",

    "abstract": "Predictive processing frameworks of cortical functioning propose that neural populations in different cortical layers serve distinct roles in representing the world. There are distinct testable theories within this framework that we examined with a 7T fMRI study, where we contrasted responses in primary visual cortex (V1) to expected (75% likely) and unexpected (25%) Gabor orientations. Multivariate decoding analyses revealed an interaction between expectation and layer, such that expected events could be decoded with comparable accuracy across layers, while unexpected events could only be decoded in superficial laminae. These results are in line with predictive processing accounts where expected virtual input is injected into deep layers, while superficial layers process the  error with respect to expected signals. While this account of cortical processing has been popular for decades, such distinctions have not previously been demonstrated in the human sensory brain. We discuss how both prediction and error processes may operate together to shape our unitary perceptual experiences.",

    "abstract": "Tau is a microtubule associated protein that plays important roles in regulating the properties of microtubules and axonal transport, as well as tauopathies associated with toxic aggregates leading to neurodegenerative diseases. It is encoded by the MAPT gene forming multiple isoforms by alternative splicing of exons 2/3 at the N-terminal and exon 10 which determines the numbers of microtubule binding repeats (3R or 4R). The high molecular weight (MW) tau isoform termed Big tau contains an additional large exon 4a generating a long projecting domain and expressed as a 110 kDa protein. Big tau was originally discovered in the peripheral nervous system but later found in selective CNS areas that project to the periphery as well as in the cerebellum and the visual system. However, there is a gap of knowledge in understanding the expression patterns and the role of Big tau during normal neuronal development and pathological conditions relative to the common low MW isoforms. Here we investigated the properties of Big tau in the retina and optic nerve and in particular its unique isoform structure as a middle MW of 90kDa and its distribution in retinal ganglion cells and axons of the optic nerve. We discovered that Big tau expresses the 4a exon as well as exons 6 and 10 (4R), lacking exons 2/3 but sharing the extensive phosphorylation characteristic of other tau isoforms. Importantly, early in development the visual system expresses only the low MW isoform (3R) switching to both the low and middle MW isoforms (4R) in adult retinal ganglion neurons and their corresponding axons. This is a unique structure and expression pattern of Big tau likely associated with different properties than what has been previously described, requiring more research to elucidate the detailed roles of Big tau in the visual system.",

    "abstract": "Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a betaherpesvirus that causes severe disease in immunocompromised transplant recipients. Immunotherapy with CD8 T cells specific for HCMV antigens presented on HLA class-I molecules is explored as strategy for long-term relief to such patients, but the antiviral effectiveness of T cell preparations cannot be efficiently predicted by available methods. Therefore, we developed an Assay for Rapid Measurement of Antiviral T-cell Activity (ARMATA) by real-time automated fluorescent microscopy and used it to study the ability of CD8 T cells to neutralize HCMV and control its spread. As a proof of principle, we used TCR-transgenic T cells specific for the immunodominant HLA-A02-restricted tegumental phosphoprotein pp65. pp65 expression follows an early/late kinetic, but it is not clear at which stage of the virus cycle it acts as an antigen. We measured control of HCMV infection by T cells as early as 6 hours post infection (hpi). The timing of the antigen recognition indicated that it occurred before the late phase of the virus cycle, but also that virion-associated pp65 was not recognized during virus entry into cells. Monitoring of pp65 gene expression dynamics by reporter fluorescent genes revealed that pp65 was detectable as early as 6 hpi, and that a second and much larger bout of expression occurs in the late phase of the virus cycle by 48 hpi. Since transgenic (Tg)-pp65 specific CD8 T cells were activated even when DNA replication was blocked, our data argue that pp65 acts as an early virus gene for immunological purposes. Therefore, ARMATA does not only allow same-day identification of antiviral T-cell activity, but also provides a method to define the timing of antigen recognition in the context of HCMV infection.",

    "abstract": "Enveloped viruses deliver their genomes into the cell cytoplasm by membrane fusion; in contrast, membrane penetration by non-enveloped viruses is more diverse and less well understood. Enteroviruses, one of the largest groups of non-enveloped viruses, cause diseases ranging from the common cold to life-threatening encephalitis. To initiate infection, most enteroviruses enter cells by endocytosis. However, how enterovirus particles or RNA genomes cross the endosome membrane into the cytoplasm remains unknown. Here we used cryo-electron tomography of infected cells to show that endosomes containing rhinovirus 2, echovirus 18, echovirus 30, or enterovirus 71 deform, rupture, and release their content into the cytoplasm. Blocking endosome acidification with bafilomycin A1 reduced the number of enterovirus particles that released their genomes in endosomes, but did not prevent them from reaching the cytoplasm. Inhibiting N-WASP-mediated post-endocytic membrane remodeling with wiskostatin promoted abortive enterovirus genome release in endosomes. We show that the rupture of endosomes also occurs in uninfected cells. In summary, our results indicate that cellular membrane remodeling disrupts enterovirus-containing endosomes and thus releases the virus genomes and particles into the cytoplasm. Since the studied enteroviruses employ different receptors for cell entry but are all delivered into the cytoplasm by cell-mediated endosome disruption, it is possible that many other enteroviruses utilize endosome rupture to infect cells.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterial pathogen that poses a major threat to human health. The ability of this bacterium to adapt to stresses encountered in the host is essential for disease. The stringent response is a signalling pathway utilised by all bacteria to alarm cells when stressed, and has been linked to the virulence of a number of species. This signalling pathway is controlled by the nucleotide alarmones guanosine tetra-(ppGpp) and pentaphosphate (pppGpp: collectively termed (p)ppGpp), produced in S. aureus by three synthetase enzymes: Rel, RelP and RelQ. Here, we used a triple (p)ppGpp synthetase mutant ((p)ppGpp0) to examine the importance of this signalling network for the survival and virulence of S. aureus in vivo. Using an established zebrafish larval infection model, we observed that infection with (p)ppGpp0 resulted in attenuated virulence, which was not due to a reduced ability of the mutant to replicate in vivo. Of the three (p)ppGpp synthetases, Rel was established as key during infection, but roles for RelP and RelQ were also observed. Zebrafish myeloid cell depletion restored the virulence of (p)ppGpp0 during systemic infection, indicating that (p)ppGpp is important for survival within host phagocytes. Primary macrophages infection studies, followed by in vitro tolerance assays to key innate immune effectors, demonstrated that (p)ppGpp0 was more susceptible to stressors found within the intracellular macrophage environment, with roles for all three synthetases implicated. Lastly, the absence of CodY, a transcription factor linked to the stringent response, significantly increased the tolerance of S. aureus to phagolysosomal-like stressors in vitro, but had no impact in vivo. Taken together, these results define the importance of the stringent response for S. aureus infection, revealing that (p)ppGpp produced by all three synthetases is required for bacterial survival within the host environment by mediating adaptation to the phagolysosome.",

    "abstract": "ATF4 is a master transcriptional regulator of the integrated stress response leading cells towards adaptation or death. Since its discovery, the delayed translation reinitiation mechanism, with reinitiation-permissive uORF1 playing a key role, was thought to underlie the ATF4 stress-induced upregulation. However, mounting evidence challenging this mechanism as the sole source of ATF4 translation control prompted us to investigate additional means of its regulation. Contrasting the original model, we show that inhibitory uORF2 is inducible and translated even under stress; that it encompasses two post-transcriptionally modified adenines performing antagonistic roles; and that the canonical ATF4 translation start site is robustly leaky-scanned. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the presence of a stable stem-loop in the uORF2/ATF4 overlap, immediately preceded by near-cognate CUG, introduces another layer of regulation in the form of ribosome queuing. Thus, ATF4 translational control is much more complex than originally described underpinning its key role in diverse biological processes.",

    "abstract": "The pericentromeric heterochromatin of eukaryotic chromosomes primarily consists of abundant non-coding repeats known as satellite DNA, which promote accurate chromosome segregation and genome stability. During interphase, sequence-specific satellite DNA-binding proteins cluster repeats from multiple chromosomes into foci known as chromocenters, which function to encapsulate the entire genome in a single nucleus. Despite the pivotal role of satellite DNA-binding proteins and chromocenters in cellular function, the proteins associated with these repetitive sequences remains incompletely characterized. Here, we use quantitative mass spectrometry to characterize the chromocenter-associated proteome in Drosophila embryos, ovaries and testes using two satellite DNA-binding proteins, D1 and Prod, as baits. We identify nearly 500 interactions, including known heterochromatin-associated proteins as well as proteins previously unlinked to satellite DNA or chromocenters. Among these interactions, we find that multiple components of the transposon-silencing piRNA pathway are associated with chromocenters. Strikingly, we reveal that proper satellite DNA clustering plays a role in transgenerational transposon repression, such that mothers with disrupted chromocenters give rise to progeny that exhibit transposon de-repression, germ cell loss and gonadal atrophy. Overall, our study highlights a novel link between satellite DNA repeats and transposon repression and lays the foundation for a more comprehensive understanding of satellite DNA function across tissues.",

    "abstract": "Cell competition is a process that compares the relative fitness of progenitor cells, resulting in  winners, which contribute further to development, and  losers, which are excluded, and is likely a universal quality control process that contributes to the fitness of an individual. Cell competition also has pathological consequences, and can create super-competitor cells responsible for tumor progression. We are studying cell competition during germline regeneration in the colonial ascidian, Botryllus schlosseri. Germline regeneration is due to the presence of germline stem cells (GSCs) which have a unique property: a competitive phenotype. When GSCs from one individual are transplanted into another, the donor and recipient cells compete for germline development. Often the donor GSCs win, and completely replace the gametes of the recipient-a process called germ cell parasitism (gcp). gcp is a heritable trait, and winner and loser genotypes can be found in nature and reared in the lab. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying gcp are unknown. Using an ex vivo migration assay, we show that GSCs isolated from winner genotypes migrate faster and in larger clusters than losers, and that cluster size correlates with expression of the Notch ligand, Jagged. Both cluster size and jagged expression can be manipulated simultaneously in a genotype dependent manner: treatment of loser GSCs with hepatocyte growth factor increases both jagged expression and cluster size, while inhibitors of the MAPK pathway decrease jagged expression and cluster size in winner GSCs. Live imaging in individuals transplanted with labeled winner and loser GSCs reveal that they migrate to the niche, some as small clusters, with the winners having a slight advantage in niche occupancy. Together, this suggests that the basis of GSC competition resides in a combination in homing ability and niche occupancy, and may be controlled by differential utilization of the Notch pathway.",

    "abstract": "The increase in the density of woody plants threatens the integrity of grassy ecosystems. It remains unclear if such encroachment can be explained mostly by direct effects of soil conditions and hydrology on woody plant growth or by indirect effects on fire regime and herbivory imposing tree recruitment limitation. Here, we investigate whether woody plant functional traits provide a mechanistic understanding of the complex relationships between these direct and indirect effects. We first assess the role of rainfall, soil fertility, texture, and geomorphology to explain variation in woody plant encroachment following anthropogenically-induced fire suppression across the Serengeti ecosystem. Second, we explore trait-environment relationships and how these mediate vegetation response to fire suppression. We find that woody plant encroachment is strongest in areas with high soil fertility, high rainfall, intermediate catenae positions, and fine soil textures. These conditions promote woody plant communities associated with small stature, small seed sizes, and high recruit densities (linked to a recruitment-stature trade-off). The positioning of species along this  recruitment-stature axis was found to be the most important predictor of recruitment limitation. Areas that support such plant communities - e.g. mid-catena position - were most sensitive to woody plant encroachment. These findings demonstrate the importance of trait-environment relationships in predicting the impact of human alterations on local vegetation change. Understanding how environmental factors directly (resources) and indirectly (legacy effects and plant traits) determine woody plant encroachment supports the development of process-based ecosystem structure and function models.",

    "abstract": "In a multi-host system, understanding host-species contribution to transmission is key to appropriately targeting control and preventive measures. Outbreak reconstruction methods aiming to identify who-infected-whom by combining epidemiological and genetic data could contribute to achieving this goal. However, the majority of these methods remain untested on realistic simulated multi-host data. Mycobacterium bovis is a slowly evolving multi-host pathogen and previous studies on outbreaks involving both cattle and wildlife have identified observation biases. Indeed, contrary to cattle, sampling wildlife is difficult. The aim of our study was to evaluate and compare the performances of three existing outbreak reconstruction methods (seqTrack, outbreaker2 and TransPhylo) on M. bovis multi-host data simulated with and without biases.\n\nExtending an existing transmission model, we simulated 30 bTB outbreaks involving cattle, badgers and wild boars and defined six sampling schemes mimicking observation biases. We estimated general and specific to multi-host systems epidemiological indicators. We tested four alternative transmission scenarios changing the mutation rate or the composition of the epidemiological system. The reconstruction of who-infected-whom was sensitive to the mutation rate and seqTrack reconstructed prolific super-spreaders. TransPhylo and outbreaker2 poorly estimated the contribution of each host-species and could not reconstruct the presence of a dead-end epidemiological host. However, the host-species of cattle (but not badger) index cases was correctly reconstructed by seqTrack and outbreaker2. These two specific indicators improved when considering an observation bias.\n\nWe found an overall poor performance for the three methods on simulated biased and unbiased bTB data. This seemed partly attributable to the low evolutionary rate characteristic of M. bovis leading to insufficient genetic information, but also to the complexity of the simulated multi-host system. This study highlights the importance of an integrated approach and the need to develop new outbreak reconstruction methods adapted to complex epidemiological systems and tested on realistic multi-host data.\n\nAuthor summarySome pathogens like the one responsible for bovine tuberculosis can infect multiple species. Identifying which species transmitted and to which other species in such an outbreak presents a unique challenge, especially when difficult to observe wildlife species are concerned. One way to tackle this issue would be to reconstruct who-infected-whom in an outbreak and then identify the role each species played. However, methods that enable this type of reconstruction have not been tested in the context of transmission between unevenly observed species. Moreover, the pathogen responsible for bovine tuberculosis evolves slowly, which further complicates the reconstruction of who-infected-whom. We thus simulated realistic and complex bovine tuberculosis outbreaks on which we tested three widely used methods. We found poor performances for all three tested methods, which highlights the need to develop new methods adapted to outbreaks involving multiple species. Our results also underline the need to combine multiple types of methods and data sources in addition to the reconstruction of who-infected-whom, such as the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees or identifying possible infectious contacts through investigations, when studying an outbreak.",

    "abstract": "Bet hedging is a ubiquitous strategy for risk reduction in the face of unpredictable environmental change where a lineage lowers its variance in fitness across environments at the expense of also lowering its arithmetic mean fitness. Previously, deterministic research has quantified this trade-off using geometric mean fitness (GMF), and has found that bet hedging is expected to evolve if and only if it has a higher GMF than the wild-type. We introduce a novel stochastic framework that leverages both individual-based simulations and Markov chain numerics to capture the effects of stochasticity in the phenotypic distribution of diversified bet hedger offspring, in environmental regime, and in reproductive output. We find that modeling stochasticity can alter the sign of selection for the bet hedger compared to the deterministic predictions. We show that stochasticity in phenotype and in environment drive the sign of selection to differ from the deterministic prediction in opposing ways: phenotypic stochasticity causes bet hedging to be less beneficial than predicted, while environmental stochasticity causes bet hedging to be more beneficial than predicted. We conclude that existing, deterministic methods may not be sufficient to predict when bet hedging traits are adaptive.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe liver is the sixth most common site of primary cancer in humans and is frequently colonized by metastases from cancers of other organs. Few studies have investigated the transcriptomic profiles of matched primary tumor and hepatic metastases of patients. Moreover, the read length of 100-200 bases in conventional short-read RNA sequencing is too short, which makes it difficult to directly infer the full-length transcript structure. To help develop effective treatments and improve survival, it is crucial to understand the complex and diverse molecular mechanisms of primary and metastatic liver cancers.\n\nMethodsNinety-five primary and secondary liver cancer patients who underwent hepatic resection were included with long-read sequencing isoform-sequencing and short-read RNA sequencing. We compared the transcriptome landscapes of primary and metastatic liver cancers and systematically investigated HCC, paired primary tumors and liver metastases, and matched non-tumor liver tissues.\n\nResultsWe defined the full-length isoform-level transcriptome of human primary and metastatic liver cancers and identified isoform-level diversity in HCC and metastasis-associated transcriptome variations in metastatic liver cancers. Specific RNA transcripts and isoform switching events with clinical implications were profoundly discovered in liver cancer. Metastasis-specific transcripts that can predict the metastatic risk and identify the primary sites of cancers of unknown primary liver metastasis patients were defined. Additionally, we found that adjacent paracancerous liver tissues are abnormal and characterized the premetastatic immunological and metabolic alterations in the liver that favor the spread of cancer metastases.\n\nConclusionsOur findings strongly highlight the powerfulness of full-length transcriptome profiling to yield novel biological insights into understanding the molecular basis of tumorigenesis and will further benefit the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancers.",

Our results reveal a set of strategically placed selectivity filters along the ligand entry pathway of MopR. These filters act as checkpoints, screening diverse aromatic ligands at the protein surface based on their chemical features and sizes. Ligands meeting specific criteria are allowed to enter the sensing site in an orientation-dependent manner. Sequence and structural analyses demonstrate the conservation of this ligand entry mechanism across the sensor class, with individual amino acids along the selectivity filter path playing a critical role in ligand selection. Together, this investigation highlights the importance of interactions with the ligand entry pathway, in addition to interactions within the binding pocket, for achieving ligand selectivity in biological sensing. The findings enhance our understanding of ligand selectivity in bacterial phenol biosensors and provide insights for the rational expansion of the biosensor repertoire, particularly for the biotechnologically relevant class of aromatic pollutants.",

    "abstract": "Conventional trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) setups are invasive and cannot directly measure monolayer integrity in co-culture. These limitations are addressed by porous membrane electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (PM-ECIS), which measures barrier integrity in cell monolayers grown directly on permeable membranes patterned with electrodes. Here we advance the design and utility of PM-ECIS by investigating its sensitivity to working electrode size and correlation to TEER. Gold electrodes were fabricated on porous membrane inserts using hot embossing and UV lithography, with working electrode diameters of 250, 500, and 750 {micro}m within the same insert. Frequency scans of confluent primary endothelial monolayers showed normalized resistance peaking at 4 kHz, consistent with traditional solid substrate ECIS. Sensitivity to resistance changes (4 kHz) during endothelial barrier formation was inversely proportional to electrode size, with the smallest electrodes being the most sensitive (p<0.001). Similarly, smaller electrodes were most sensitive to changes in impedance (40 kHz) corresponding to cell spreading and proliferation (p<0.001). Barrier disruption with EGTA was detectable by 250 and 750 {micro}m (p<0.01), and 500 {micro}m electrodes (p=0.058). Resistances measured by PM-ECIS vs. TEER for sodium chloride solutions were positively and significantly correlated for all electrode sizes (r>0.9; p<0.0001), but only with 750 {micro}m electrodes for endothelial monolayers (r=0.71; p=0.058). These data inform design and selection of PM-ECIS electrodes for specific applications, and support PM-ECIS as a promising alternative to conventional TEER due to its capacity for direct, non-invasive, and real-time assessment of cells cultured on porous membranes.",

    "abstract": "Assigning cell identity to clusters of single cells is an essential step towards extracting biological insights from many genomics datasets. Although annotation workflows for datasets built with a single modality are well established, limitations exist in annotating cell types in datasets with multiple modalities due to the need for a framework to exploit them jointly. While, in principle, different modalities could convey complementary information about cell identity, it is unclear to what extent they can be combined to improve the accuracy and resolution of cell type annotations.\n\nHere, we present a conceptual framework to examine and jointly interrogate distinct modalities to identify cell types. We integrated our framework into a series of vignettes, using immune cells as a well-studied example, and demonstrate cell type annotation workflows ranging from using single-cell RNA-seq datasets alone, to using multiple modalities such as single-cell Multiome (RNA and chromatin accessibility), CITE-seq (RNA and surface proteins). In some cases, one or other single modality is superior to the other for identification of specific cell types, in others combining the two modalities improves resolution and the ability to identify finer subpopulations.

    "abstract": "DNA molecules, as natural information carriers, have several benefits over conventional digital storage mediums, including high information density and long-term durability. It is expected to be a promising candidate for information storage. However, despite significant research in this field, the pace of development has been slow due to the lack of complete encoding-decoding platform and simulaton-evaluation system. And the mutation in DNA sequences during synthesis and sequencing requires multiple experiments, and wet experiments can be costly. Thus, a silicon-based simulation platform is urgently needed for promoting research. Therefore, we proposed DNA Storage Designer, the first online platform to simulate the whole process of DNA storage experiments. Our platform offers classical and novel technologies and experimental settings that simulate three key processes: encoding, error simulation, and decoding for DNA storage system. Fisrt, 8 mainstream encoding methods were embedded in the encoding process to convert files to DNA sequences. Secondly, to uncover potential mutations and sequence distribution changes in actual experiments we integrate the simulation setting for five typical experiment sub-processes (synthesis, decay, PCR, sampling, and sequencing) in the error simulation stage. Finally, the corresponding decoding process realizes the conversion of DNA sequence to binary sequence. All the above simulation processes correspond to an analysis report will provide guides for better experiment design for researchers convenience. In short, DNA Storage Designer is an easy-to-use and automatic web-server for simulating DNA storage experiments, which could advance the development of DNA storage-related research. And it is freely available for all users at: https://dmci.xmu.edu.cn/dna/.\n\nAuthor summaryDNA storage technology is an emerging and promising storage technology. At the same time, DNA storage is an interdisciplinary technology that requires researchers to know both computer cryptography and biological experiments knowledge. However, DNA storage experiments are costly and lengthy, many studies have been prevented by the lack of a comprehensive design and evaluation platform to guide DNA storage experiments. Herein, we introduce DNA Storage Designer, the first integrated and practical web server for providing the simulation of the whole process of DNA storage application, from encoding, error simulation during preservation, to decoding. In the encoding process, we not only provided the coding DNA sequences but also analyzed the sequence stability. In the error simulation process, we simulated as many experimental situations as possible, such as different mutation probabilities of DNA sequences due to being stored in different bacteria hosts or different sequencing platforms. The platform provides high freedom in that users could not only encode their files and conduct the entire operation but also could upload FASTA files and only simulate the sustaining process of sequences and imitate the mutation errors together with distribution changes of sequences.",

    "abstract": "This study presents TooT-PLM-ionCT, a composite framework consisting of three distinct systems, each with different architectures and trained on unique datasets. Each system within TooT-PLM-ionCT is dedicated to a specific task: segregating ion channels (ICs) and ion transporters (ITs) from other membrane proteins and differentiating ICs from ITs. These systems exploit the capabilities of six diverse Protein Language Models (PLMs) - ProtBERT, ProtBERT-BFD, ESM-1b, ESM-2 (650M parameters), and ESM-2 (15B parameters). As these proteins play a pivotal role in the regulation of ion movement across cellular membranes, they are integral to numerous biological processes and overall cellular vitality. To circumvent the costly and time-consuming nature of wet lab experiments, we harness the predictive prowess of PLMs, drawing parallels with techniques in natural language processing. Our strategy engages six classifiers, embracing both conventional methodologies and a deep learning model, for each of our defined tasks. Furthermore, we delve into critical factors influencing our tasks, including the implications of dataset balancing, the effect of frozen versus fine-tuned PLM representations, and the potential variance between half and full precision floating-point computations. Our empirical results showcase superior performance in distinguishing ITs from other membrane proteins and differentiating ICs from ITs, while the task of discriminating ICs from other membrane proteins exhibits results commensurate with the current state-of-the-art.\n\nAuthor summaryIn our research, we have designed TooT-PLM-ionCT, a composite framework composed of three unique systems, each tailored to a specific protein classification task and trained on different datasets. This framework is our tool for categorizing integral membrane proteins, specifically ion channels and ion transporters. These proteins are essential to the health of cells, as they manage ion movement across cell membranes. To bypass the high costs and long timelines of conventional lab experiments, we have turned to advanced computation methods akin to how computers process human language. Our three-pronged approach harnesses six top-tier Protein Language Models and a range of classifiers to discern between these key proteins. In doing so, we also evaluated the effects of various conditions, like dataset balance, representation methods, and levels of computation precision, on the accuracy of our classification tasks. The outcomes show our framework effectively identifies ion transporters, sets them apart from ion channels, and distinguishes ion channels on par with existing top-notch techniques. The performance, however, can vary based on the task, suggesting that customizing the approach for each task could be beneficial. In the future, we plan to expand the depth and breadth of our protein study by incorporating additional knowledge sources, utilizing more refined representation methods, and testing our framework on larger and diverse protein datasets. This progress sets us on a path to better understand proteins and their roles in cellular health.",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are very suited for biological sequence data, because the structure of protein and nucleic acid sequences show many analogies to natural language. Complex relationships in biological sequence can be learned, although there may not be a clear concept of words, because they can be generated through tokenization. Training is subsequently performed for masked token prediction. With this strategy, the models learn both the token sequence identity and a larger sequence context. We developed a framework to interrogate what a model learns, which is both relevant for the interpretability of the model and to evaluate its potential for specific tasks.\n\nWe used a DNA language model, which is trained on the human reference genome with a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model. In this model, tokens are defined with overlapping k-mers. To gain insight into the models learning, we interrogated how the model performs predictions, extracted token embeddings, and defined a fine-tuning benchmarking task to predict the next tokens of different sizes without overlaps. This task is very suited to evaluate different pretrained DNA language models, also called foundation models, since it does not interrogate specific genome biology, does not depend on the tokenization strategy, the size of the vocabulary, the dictionary, or the number of parameters used to train the model. Lastly, the task performs without leakage of information from token identity into the prediction task, which makes it particularly useful to evaluate the learning of sequence context.\n\nThrough this assessment we discovered that the model with overlapping k-mers struggles to learn larger sequence context. Instead, the learned embeddings largely represent token sequence. Still, good performance is achieved for genome biology inspired fine-tuning tasks. Models with overlapping tokens may be used for tasks where a larger sequence context is of less relevance, but the token sequence directly represents the desired learning feature. This emphasizes the need to interrogate knowledge representation in biological large language models. Transparency is particularly important for biomedical use cases and an understanding of what the models are learning can be used to match the model to the desired task.",

    "abstract": "Acridine Orange (AO) has rich photophysics that has been exploited to study its interaction with RNA and DNA. Traditionally AO was used to stain cells differentiating nucleus and cytoplasm due to the differences in DNA and RNA differential composition. AO cell labeling shows complex behavior depending on several parameters, such as concentration, pH, etc. Such complex photophysics will benefit from a model-free analysis such as the spectral phasor (SP) for hyperspectral imaging. The SP linear combination and reciprocity principles allow us to understand better the AO spectral shift associated with its exploration of the different molecular environments in cells. Using this approach, we identified the SP fingerprints for RNA and DNA for in vitro experiments, which remain invariant for fixed and live cells. However, the SP analysis of the AO fluorescence from live cells shows the occurrence of a third spectral component at 640 nm. The linear properties of the SP analysis enable quantification of the AO bound to RNA, DNA, and a third component. By co-labeling with AO and LysoTracker, we associated part of these subcellular structures with acidic compartments. Nonetheless, we could differentiate AO self-interactions from its binding to RNA within cytoplasmic compartments by use of the SP analysis. This work establishes the use of SP for hyperspectral imaging of AO for the first time, expanding our knowledge of its complex photophysics and promoting further application for in vivo cell imaging.",

    "abstract": "MYCN activates canonical MYC targets involved in ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis and represses neuronal differentiation genes to drive oncogenesis in neuroblastoma (NB). How MYCN orchestrates global gene expression remains incompletely understood. Our study finds that MYCN binds promoters to up-regulate canonical MYC targets but binds to both enhancers and promoters to repress differentiation genes. MYCN-binding also increases H3K4me3 and H3K27ac on canonical MYC target promoters and decreases H3K27ac on neuronal differentiation gene enhancers and promoters. WDR5 is needed to facilitate MYCN promoter binding to activate canonical MYC target genes, whereas MYCN recruits G9a to enhancers to repress neuronal differentiation genes. Targeting both MYCNs active and repressive transcriptional activities using both WDR5 and G9a inhibitors synergistically suppresses NB growth. We demonstrate that MYCN cooperates with WDR5 and G9a to orchestrate global gene transcription. The targeting of both these cofactors is a novel therapeutic strategy to indirectly target the oncogenic activity of MYCN.",

One example of organizing and evaluating mechanistic evidence is the Key Characteristics approach of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs on the Identification of Carcinogenic Hazards to Humans. The Key Characteristics of Human Carcinogens were proposed almost 10 years ago and have been used in every IARC Monograph since 2015. We investigated the patterns and associations in the use of Key Characteristics by the independent expert Working Groups. We examined 19 Monographs (2015-2022) that evaluated 73 agents. We extracted information on the conclusions by each Working Group on the strength of evidence for agent-Key Characteristic combinations, data types that were available for decisions, and the role mechanistic data played in the final cancer hazard classification. We conducted both descriptive and association analyses within and across data types. We found that IARC Working Groups were cautious when evaluating mechanistic evidence: for only [~]13% of the agents was strong evidence assigned for any Key Characteristic. Genotoxicity and cell proliferation were most data-rich, while little evidence was available for DNA repair and immortalization Key Characteristics. Analysis of the associations among Key Characteristics revealed that only chemicals metabolic activation was significantly co-occurring with genotoxicity and cell proliferation/death. Evidence from exposed humans was limited, while mechanistic evidence from rodent studies in vivo was often available. Only genotoxicity and cell proliferation/death were strongly associated with decisions on whether mechanistic data was impactful on the final cancer hazard classification. The practice of using the Key Characteristics approach is now well-established at IARC Monographs and other government agencies and the analyses presented herein will inform the future use of mechanistic evidence in regulatory decision-making.",

However, the role of the IKK2-NF{kappa}B pathway in medial calcification remains to be elucidated. In this study, we found that CKD induces inflammatory pathways through the local activation of the IKK2-NF{kappa}B pathway in VMSCs associated with calcified vascular stiffness. Despite reducing the expression of inflammatory mediators, complete inhibition of the IKK2-NF{kappa}B pathway in vitro and in vivo unexpectedly exacerbated vascular mineralization and stiffness. In contrast, activation of NF{kappa}B by SMC-specific I{kappa}B deficiency attenuated calcified vascular stiffness in CKD. Inhibition of the IKK2-NF{kappa}B pathway induced apoptosis of VSMCs by reducing anti-apoptotic gene expression, whereas activation of NF{kappa}B reduced CKD-dependent vascular cell death. In addition, increased calcifying extracellular vesicles through the inhibition of the IKK2-NF{kappa}B pathway induced mineralization of VSMCs, which was significantly reduced by blocking cell death.

Somei-Yoshino is thought to be an interspecific hybrid derived from C. spachiana and C. speciosa; however, its origin is unclear. Since somatic mutations are randomly induced in genomes and stably transmitted through generations, we aimed to identify somatic mutations in the genome of  Somei-Yoshino to trace its propagation path. A total of 46  Somei-Yoshino clones were collected from all over Japan and subjected to whole-genome sequencing. The results revealed 684 single nucleotide variants, of which 71 were found in more than two clones. Clustering analysis of the 46 clones using these 71 variants revealed six groups, four of which contained 40 of the 46 clones. In addition, because each of the four clones closely planted in Ueno Park, Tokyo, Japan, clustered into the four different groups, we considered that these four clones could be the ancestors of the  Somei-Yoshino clones found in Japan. Furthermore, based on the comparison of mutant alleles with the genomes of Cerasus species, one of the four trees was concluded as the closest to the origin. Here, we propose that the origin of  Somei-Yoshino is a chimera derived from at least four somatic mutants.",

Dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 is one of the key translational control events that is required to increase de novo protein synthesis that underlies long-lasting plasticity and memory consolidation. Here, we interrogate the molecular pathways of translational control that are triggered by stimulation of neurons with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which results in eIF2 dephosphorylation and de novo protein synthesis. Primary rodent neurons exposed to BDNF displayed elevated translation, but not transcription, of GADD34, which facilitates eIF2 dephosphorylation and subsequent de novo protein synthesis. Furthermore, GADD34 requires G-actin generated by cofilin to dephosphorylate eIF2 and enhance protein synthesis. Finally, GADD34 is required for the BDNF-induced translation of synaptic plasticity-related proteins. Overall, we provide evidence that neurons repurpose GADD34, an effector of the Integrated Stress Response, as an orchestrator of rapid increases in eIF2-dependent translation in response to plasticity-inducing stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Hostile attribution bias refers to the tendency to interpret social situations as intentionally hostile. While previous research has focused on its developmental origins and behavioral consequences, the underlying neural mechanisms remain underexplored. Here, we employed functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate the neural correlates of hostile attribution bias. While undergoing fNIRS, participants listened to and provided attribution ratings for 21 hypothetical scenarios where a characters actions resulted in a negative outcome for the listener. Ratings of hostile intentions were averaged to obtain a measure of hostile attribution bias. Using intersubject-representational similarity analysis, we found that participants with similar levels of hostile attribution bias exhibited higher levels of neural synchrony during narrative listening, suggesting shared interpretations of the scenarios. This effect was localized to the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), and was particularly prominent in scenarios where the characters intentions were highly ambiguous. We then grouped participants into high and low bias groups based on a median split of their hostile attribution bias scores. A similarity-based classifier trained on the neural data classified participants as having high or low bias with 76% accuracy, indicating that the neural time courses during narrative listening was systematically different between the two groups. Furthermore, hostile attribution bias correlated negatively with attributional complexity, a measure of ones tendency to consider multifaceted causes when explaining behavior. Our study sheds light on the neural mechanisms underlying hostile attribution bias and highlights the potential of using fNIRS to develop non-intrusive and cost-effective neural markers of this socio-cognitive bias.\n\nSignificance StatementInferring the intentions from behavior is crucial for adaptive social functioning. A predisposition towards interpreting intentions as hostile is a significant predictor of interpersonal conflict and aggressive tendencies. Using fNIRS, we found that individual differences in hostile attribution bias shaped neural synchrony in the VMPFC while processing real-world social situations. Additionally, we were able to distinguish between participants with high and low hostile attribution bias from neural activity time courses. These results reveal how subjective interpretations of social situations are influenced by hostile attribution bias and reflected in the temporal dynamics of the VMPFC. Our findings lay the groundwork for future studies aimed at understanding the neurobiological basis of socio-cognitive biases, as well as interventions aimed at mitigating these biases.",

    "abstract": "Insects rely on their highly efficient and precise olfactory systems to find suitable mates, host plants and oviposition sites, and adapt to the changing environment. The odorant receptors (ORs) including pheromone receptors (PRs) play a vital role in this process. While extensive studies have been focusing on deorphanization of lepidopteran PR genes, the information on the ligand profiles of general ORs is still sparse. In the present study, we identified a repertoire of 61 ORs including the co-receptor Orco from antennal and ovipositor transcriptomes of the turnip moth Agrotis segetum, which clustered in all the major lepidopteran OR clades. We characterized the function of eight female-biased expressed ORs in Xenopus oocytes and found three ORs differentially tuned to plant volatile compounds that might be repulsive or attractive to the moths. AsegOR13 was broadly tuned to a number of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) while AsegOR20 was specific to citral; AsegOR17 was narrowly tuned to the alcohols, isoamyl alcohol, pentanol and benzyl alcohol, that are potentially attractive to moths. The orthologues of the three ORs in other moth species seem to share the conserved function. Our results support the hypothesis that insects recognize their host plants mostly by detecting the mixture of ubiquitous compounds, instead of taxonomically characteristic host compounds. The combination of narrowly and broadly tuned ORs will ensure both the accuracy of the most important odor signals and the plasticity of the olfactory system to the changes in the environment.",

Here we used a task requiring bimanual responses to go stimuli, but selective inhibition of only one of those responses following a stop signal. We assessed how proactive cues affect the nature of both the responding and stopping processes, and the well-documented \"stopping delay\" in the continuing action following successful stopping. In this task, estimates of the speed of inhibition based on a simple-stopping model are inappropriate, and have produced inconsistent findings about the effects of proactive control on motor inhibition. We instead used a multi-modal approach, based on improved methods of detecting and interpreting partial electromyographical (EMG) responses and the recently proposed SIS (simultaneously inhibit and start) model of selective stopping behaviour. Our results provide clear and converging evidence that proactive cues reduce the stopping delay effect by slowing bimanual responses and speeding unimanual responses, with a negligible effect on the speed of the stopping process.",

    "abstract": "In the brain, all neurons are driven by the activity of other neurons, some of which maybe simultaneously recorded, but most are not. As such, models of neuronal activity need to account for simultaneously recorded neurons and the influences of unmeasured neurons. This can be done through inclusion of model terms for observed external variables (e.g., tuning to stimuli) as well as terms for latent sources of variability. Determining the influence of groups of neurons on each other relative to other influences is important to understand brain functioning. The parameters of statistical models fit to data are commonly used to gain insight into the relative importance of those influences. Scientific interpretation of models hinge upon unbiased parameter estimates. However, evaluation of biased inference is rarely performed and sources of bias are poorly understood. Through extensive numerical study and analytic calculation, we show that common inference procedures and models are typically biased. We demonstrate that accurate parameter selection before estimation resolves model non-identifiability and mitigates bias. In diverse neurophysiology data sets, we found that contributions of coupling to other neurons are often overestimated while tuning to exogenous variables are underestimated in common methods. We explain heterogeneity in observed biases across data sets in terms of data statistics. Finally, counter to common intuition, we found that model non-identifiability contributes to bias, not variance, making it a particularly insidious form of statistical error. Together, our results identify the causes of statistical biases in common models of neural data, provide inference procedures to mitigate that bias, and reveal and explain the impact of those biases in diverse neural data sets.\n\n1 Author SummaryExperimental data of interacting cells under the influence of external as well as unobserved factors are ubiquitous. Parametric models are often used to gain understanding of the processes that generated such data. As such, biological understanding hinges upon accurate inference of model parameters. Whether and how systemic parameter bias manifests in such models is poorly understood. We study this issue in the specific context of estimating the static and dynamic interactions of simultaneously recorded neurons influenced by stimuli and unobserved neurons. Through extensive numerical study and analytic calculations, we identify and mitigate bias in such models. When applied to diverse neural data sets, we found that common models and inference procedures often overestimate the importance of coupling and underestimate tuning. In contrast to common intuition, we find that model non-identifiability contributes to estimation bias, not variance, making it a particularly insidious form of statistical error. As the experimental and statistical issues examined here are common, the insights and solutions we developed will likely impact many fields of biology.",

    "abstract": "The etiopathology of Parkinsons disease has been associated with mitochondrial defects at genetic, laboratory, epidemiological, and clinical level. These converging lines of evidence suggest that mitochondrial defects are systemic and causative factors in the pathophysiology of PD, rather than being mere correlates. Understanding mitochondrial biology in PD at granular level is therefore crucial from both basic science and translational perspectives.\n\nIn a recent study, we investigated mitochondrial alterations in fibroblasts obtained from PD patients assessing mitochondrial function in relation to clinical measures. Our findings demonstrated that the magnitude of mitochondrial alterations parallels disease severity. In this study, we extend these investigations to blood cells and dopamine neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells reprogrammed from PD patients. To overcome the inherent metabolic heterogeneity of blood cells, we focused our analyses on metabolically homogeneous, accessible, and expandable erythroblasts. Our results confirm the presence of mitochondrial anomalies in erythroblasts and induced dopamine neurons. Consistent with our previous findings in fibroblasts, we observed that mitochondrial alterations are reversible, as evidenced by enhanced mitochondrial respiration when PD erythroblasts were cultured in a galactose medium that restricts glycolysis. This observation indicates that suppression of mitochondrial respiration may constitute a protective, adaptive response in PD pathogenesis. Notably, this effect was not observed in induced dopamine neurons, suggesting their distinct bioenergetic behavior.\n\nIn summary, we provide additional evidence for the involvement of mitochondria in the disease process by demonstrating mitochondrial abnormalities in additional cell types relevant to PD. These findings contribute to our understanding of PD pathophysiology and may have implications for the development of novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies.",

Using single-unit extracellular recordings in awake mice, we found that neural encoding of persistent movement phases is independent of the valuation (i.e., valence) of the external stimuli. Next, using opto-tagging, we identified a group of dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) motor cortex projecting (MP) neurons, which encodes the initial phase of a persistent movement rather than valence. Inactivation of dmPFC MP neurons impairs the initiation of persistence and reduces neuronal activity in the insular and motor cortex. Finally, a computational model suggests that a successive sensory stimulus acts as a triggering signal for the initiation of persistent movements. These results reveal a neural mechanism that switches the brain state from neutral to persistent during movement.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a chronic health condition characterized by excess adiposity leading to a systemic increase in inflammation and dysregulation of metabolic hormones and immune cell populations. Obesity is well established as a risk factor for many noncommunicable diseases; however, its consequences for infectious disease are poorly understood. Influenza A virus (IAV) is a highly infectious pathogen responsible for seasonal and pandemic influenza. Host risk factors, including compromised immunity and pre-existing health conditions, can contribute to increased infection susceptibility and disease severity. During viral replication in a host, the negative sense single stranded RNA genome of IAV accumulates genetic diversity that may have important consequences for viral evolution and transmission. Here, we investigated the impact of host obesity on IAV genetic variation using a diet induced obesity ferret model. We infected obese and lean male ferrets with the A/Hong Kong/1073/1999 (H9N2) IAV strain. Using a co-caging study design, we investigated the maintenance, generation, and transmission of intrahost IAV genetic variation by sequencing viral genomic RNA obtained from nasal wash samples over multiple days of infection. We found evidence for an enhanced role of positive selection acting on de novo mutations in obese hosts that led to nonsynonymous changes that rose to high frequency. In addition, we identified numerous cases of recurrent low-frequency mutations throughout the genome that were specific to obese hosts. Despite these obese-specific variants, overall viral genetic diversity did not differ significantly between obese and lean hosts. This is likely due to the high supply rate of de novo variation and common evolutionary adaptations to the ferret host regardless of obesity status, which we show are mediated by variation in the hemagglutinin (HA) and polymerase genes (PB2 and PB1). As with single nucleotide variants, we identified a class of defective viral genomes (DVGs) that were found uniquely in either obese or lean hosts, but overall DVG diversity and dynamics did not differ between the two groups. Our study provides the first insight into the consequences of host obesity on viral genetic diversity and adaptation, suggesting that host factors associated with obesity alter the selective environment experienced by a viral population, thereby impacting the spectrum of genetic variation.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is an opportunistic pathogen causing diseases ranging from mild skin infections to life-threatening conditions, including endocarditis, pneumonia, and sepsis. To identify host genes modulating this host-pathogen interaction, we infected 25 Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse strains with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA USA300) and monitored disease progression for seven days. We identified eight  susceptible CC strains with high bacterial load, tissue damage, and reduced survival. Among the surviving strains, six with minimal colonization were classified as  resistant, while the remaining six tolerated higher organ colonization ( tolerant). The kidney was the most heavily colonized organ, but liver colonization was better correlated with reduced survival. We identified four CC strains with sex differences: females survived the study period while males met our euthanasia criteria earlier. In these CC strains, males had more baseline circulating monocytes and red blood cells. We identified several CC strains that may be useful as new models for endocarditis, myocarditis, pneumonia, and resistance to MRSA infection. Resistant strains had higher pre-infection circulating neutrophils than susceptible and tolerant strains. GM-CSF, IL-1-alpha, IL-15, IL-28, and IL-31 levels increased significantly in tolerant strains after infection. Using RNA seq, we identified two pathways, IL-1 and ERK1/ERK2, as potentially involved in the mechanism of tolerance. QTL analysis identified two significant loci, on Chromosomes 18 and 3, involved in early and late survival after infection. We prioritized Npc1 and Ifi44l genes as the strongest candidates influencing survival using variant analysis and mRNA expression data within these intervals.\n\nImportanceMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a human opportunistic pathogen that can cause life-threatening diseases. To study the influence of host genetics on the outcome of MRSA infection, we infected a collection of genetically diverse mice. We identified different phenotypes for survival, organ colonization, and tissue damage, and classified CC strains into MRSA susceptible, tolerant, and resistant categories. Four CC strains had strong sex differences in infection outcome: females lived longer, and males had higher baseline circulating monocytes and red blood cells. Several of the CC strains we characterize may represent better animal models for diseases caused by MRSA. Resistant and tolerant strains appear to have different immunologic states both pre-infection and in response to infection. QTL analysis identified two genes, Npc1 and Ifi44l, as strong candidates for involvement in early and late survival after MRSA infection. Our data suggests a strong involvement of host genetics in MRSA infection outcome.",

    "abstract": "Spread of antimicrobial resistances in the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains a public health challenge. Thus, there is a continuous need for new therapeutic options with modes-of-action differing from current antibiotics. Previously, bioactivity-guided isolation identified the callyaerins, a class of hydrophobic cyclopeptides with an unusual (Z)-2,3-di-aminoacrylamide unit, as promising antitubercular agents. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying their antimycobacterial properties. Structure-activity relationship studies enabled the identification of the structural determinants relevant for their antibacterial activity. The antitubercular callyaerins are bacteriostatics selectively active against M. tuberculosis, including extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains, with minimal cytotoxicity against human cells and a promising intracellular activity in a macrophage infection model. Via spontaneous resistance mutant screens and various chemical proteomics approaches, we showed that they act by direct targeting of the non-essential, M. tuberculosis-specific putative membrane protein Rv2113, thereby triggering a complex stress response in M. tuberculosis characterized by global downregulation of lipid biosynthesis, cell division, DNA repair and replication. Our study thus not only identifies Rv2113 as a new M. tuberculosis-specific target for antitubercular drugs, which should result in less harm of the microbiome and weaker resistance development in off-target pathogens. It furthermore demonstrates that also non-essential proteins may represent efficacious targets for antimycobacterial drugs.",

    "abstract": "Peptidoglycan (PG) is the main component of the bacterial cell wall; it maintains cell shape while protecting the cell from internal osmotic pressure and external environmental challenges. PG synthesis is essential for bacterial growth and survival, and a series of PG modifications are required to allow expansion of the sacculus. Endopeptidases (EPs), for example, cleave the crosslinks between adjacent PG strands to allow the incorporation of newly synthesized PG. EPs are collectively essential for bacterial growth and must likely be carefully regulated to prevent sacculus degradation and cell death. However, EP regulation mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we used TnSeq to uncover novel EP regulation factors in Vibrio cholerae. This screen revealed that the carboxypeptidase DacA1 (PBP5) alleviates EP toxicity. dacA1 is essential for viability on LB medium, and this essentiality was suppressed by EP overexpression, revealing that EP toxicity both mitigates, and is mitigated by, a defect in dacA1. A subsequent suppressor screen to restore viability of{Delta} dacA1 in LB medium was answered by hypomorphic mutants in the PG synthesis pathway, as well as mutations that promote PG degradation. Our data thus reveal a key role of DacA1 in maintaining the balance between PG synthesis and degradation.",

In our study, lenvitinib-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells display obviously competitive growth dominance against sensitive cells through reprogramming energy metabolism. Mechanistically, when BCL2 interacting protein3 (BNIP3) overexpression activates mitophagy activity in lenvatinib-resistant HCC cells, energy imbalance signal caused by reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation levels provokes the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) sensor; subsequently, enabled AMPK specifically targets enolase 2 (ENO2) to enhance glycolysis and eventually promots the competitive capacity and dominant growth. Of note, BNIP3 deficiency shows certain inhibition of cell competition outcome. Our findings emphasize a vital role for BNIP3-AMPK-ENO2 signaling in maintaining the competitive outcome of lenvitinib-resistant HCC cells via regulating energy metabolism; meanwhile this work recognaizes BNIP3 as a promising target to overcome HCC drug resistance.",

However, intrinsic trade-offs between imaging speed and quality of EM restrict the attainable imaging area and volume. Isotropic imaging with vEM for large biological volumes remains unachievable. Here we developed EMDiffuse, a suite of algorithms designed to enhance EM and vEM capabilities, leveraging the cutting-edge image generation diffusion model. EMDiffuse demonstrates outstanding denoising and super-resolution performance, generates realistic predictions without unwarranted smoothness, improves predictions resolution by [~]30%, and exhibits excellent transferability by taking only one pair of images to fine-tune. EMDiffuse also pioneers the isotropic vEM reconstruction task, generating isotropic volume similar to that obtained using advanced FIB-SEM even in the absence of isotropic training data. We demonstrated the robustness of EMDiffuse by generating isotropic volumes from six public datasets obtained from different vEM techniques and instruments. The generated isotropic volume enables accurate organelle reconstruction, making 3D nanoscale ultrastructure analysis faster and more accessible and extending such capability to larger volumes. More importantly, EMDiffuse features self-assessment functionalities and guarantees reliable predictions for all tasks. We envision EMDiffuse to pave the way for more in-depth investigations into the intricate subcellular nanoscale structures within large areas and volumes of biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Age-associated clonal hematopoiesis (CH) occurs due to somatic mutations accrued in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that confer a selective advantage in the context of aging. The mechanisms by which CH-mutant HSCs gain this advantage with aging are not comprehensively understood. Using unbiased transcriptomic approaches, we identify Oncostatin M (OSM) signaling as a candidate contributor to aging-driven Dnmt3a-mutant CH. We find that Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs from young mice do not functionally respond to acute OSM stimulation with respect to proliferation, apoptosis, hematopoietic engraftment, or myeloid differentiation. However, young Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs transcriptionally upregulate an inflammatory cytokine network in response to acute OSM stimulation including genes encoding IL-6, IL-1{beta} and TNF. In addition, OSM-stimulated Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs upregulate the anti-inflammatory genes Socs3, Atf3 and Nr4a1, creating a negative feedback loop limiting sustained activation of the inflammatory network. In the context of an aged bone marrow (BM) microenvironment with chronically elevated levels of OSM, Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs upregulate pro-inflammatory genes but do not upregulate Socs3, Atf3 and Nr4a1. Together, our work suggests that chronic inflammation with aging exhausts the regulatory mechanisms in young CH-mutant HSCs that resolve inflammatory states, and that OSM is a master regulator of an inflammatory network that contributes to age-associated CH.",

    "abstract": "The layer of stem cells surrounding developing limbs is essential for bone formation and regeneration. Our work addresses the critical question of how these stem cells and bone template communicate to ensure that limbs form correctly. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a multifunctional endocytic receptor whose mutations are linked to bone and joint pathologies. Here, we show the abundant expression of LRP1 in skeletal progenitor cells, especially in the perichondrium - the dense layer of fibrous connective tissue enveloping the cartilage of the developing limb bud. Our mouse models reveal that LRP1 deficiency in these stem cells (Lrp1flox/flox/Prrx1Cre) but not in chondrocytes (Lrp1flox/flox/AcanCreERT2) causes disrupted articulation and cavitation starting at as early as embryonic stage 16.5. LRP1 deficiency is also associated with aberrant accumulation of LRP1 ligands including tissue-inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 and CCN2. These early abnormalities result in severe defects in multiple joints, plus markedly deformed and low-density long bones leading to dwarfism and impaired mobility. Our in vitro exploration shows unique regulation of non-canonical WNT components by LRP1 that may explain the malformation of long bones. Mechanistically, we found that LRP1 facilitates cell-association, endocytic recycling but not degradation, and graded distribution of Wnt5a in the developing limbs. We propose that LRP1-mediated endocytic regulation of availability and distribution of extracellular signalling molecules play a critical role in limb development. This provides a novel mechanism for crosstalk among skeletal elements.",

    "abstract": "Copper is one of a handful of biologically necessary heavy metals that is also a common environmental pollutant. Under normal conditions, copper ions are required for many key physiological processes. However, in excess, copper quickly results in cell and tissue damage that can range in severity from temporary injury to permanent neurological damage. Because of its biological relevance, and because many conserved copper-responsive genes also respond to other non-essential heavy metal pollutants, copper resistance in Drosophila melanogaster is a useful model system with which to investigate the genetic control of the response to heavy metal stress. Because heavy metal toxicity has the potential to differently impact specific tissues, we genetically characterized the control of the gene expression response to copper stress in a tissue- specific manner in this study. We assessed the copper stress response in head and gut tissue of 96 inbred strains from the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR) using a combination of differential expression analysis and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping. Differential expression analysis revealed clear patterns of tissue-specific expression, primarily driven by a more pronounced gene expression response in gut tissue. eQTL mapping of gene expression under control and copper conditions as well as for the change in gene expression following copper exposure (copper response eQTL) revealed hundreds of genes with tissue- specific local cis-eQTL and many distant trans-eQTL. eQTL associated with MtnA, Mdr49, Mdr50, and Sod3 exhibited genotype by environment effects on gene expression under copper stress, illuminating several tissue- and treatment-specific patterns of gene expression control. Together, our data build a nuanced description of the roles and interactions between allelic and expression variation in copper-responsive genes, provide valuable insight into the genomic architecture of susceptibility to metal toxicity, and highlight many candidate genes for future functional characterization.",

We discovered that 103 non-coding variants and 156 variants of uncertain significance are functional via affecting cell fitness. Collectively, we demonstrate PRIME capable of characterizing genetic variants at base-pair resolution and scale, advancing accurate genome annotation for disease risk prediction, diagnosis, and therapeutic target identification.",

    "abstract": "Short prokaryotic Ago accounts for most prokaryotic Argonaute (pAgo) and is involved in defending bacteria against invading nucleic acids. Short prokaryotic Ago associated with APAZ-TIR (SPARTA) has been shown to oligomerize and deplete NAD+ upon guide-mediated target DNA recognition. However, the molecular basis of SPARTA inhibition and activation remains unknown. Here we determine the cryo-EM structures of Crenotalea thermophila SPARTA in its inhibited, transient, as well as activated states. The SPARTA is auto-inhibited by its acidic tail, which occupies the guide-target binding channel. Guide mediated target binding expels this acidic tail and triggers substantial conformational changes to expose Ago-Ago dimerization interface. As a result, SPARTA assembles into an active TIR-APAZ4/short Ago4 octamer, where the four TIR domains are rearranged and packed to form NADase active sites. Together with biochemical evidence, our results provide a panoramic vision explaining SPARTA auto-inhibition and activation, and expand understanding of pAgo mediated bacterial defense systems.",

    "abstract": "In addition to amide hydrogen bonds and the hydrophobic effect, interactions involving {pi}-bonded sp2 atoms of amides, aromatics and other groups occur in protein self-assembly processes including folding, oligomerization and condensate formation. These interactions also occur in aqueous solutions of amide and aromatic compounds, where they can be quantified. Previous analysis of thermodynamic coefficients quantifying net-favorable interactions of amide compounds with other amides and aromatics revealed that interactions of amide sp2O with amide sp2N unified atoms (presumably C=O{middle dot}{middle dot}{middle dot}H-N hydrogen bonds) and amide/aromatic sp2C (lone pair-{pi}, n-{pi}*) are particularly favorable. Sp3C-sp3C (hydrophobic), sp3C-sp2C (hydrophobic, CH-{pi}), sp2C-sp2C (hydrophobic, {pi}-{pi}) and sp3C-sp2N interactions are favorable, sp2C-sp2N interactions are neutral, while sp2O-sp2O and sp2N-sp2N self-interactions and sp2O-sp3C interactions are unfavorable. Here, from determinations of favorable effects of fourteen amides on naphthalene solubility at 10, 25 and 45 {degrees}C, we dissect amide-aromatic interaction free energies into enthalpic and entropic contributions and find these vary systematically with amide composition. Analysis of these results yields enthalpic and entropic contributions to intrinsic strengths of interactions of amide sp2O, sp2N, sp2C and sp3C unified atoms with aromatic sp2C atoms. For each interaction, enthalpic and entropic contributions have the same sign and are much larger in magnitude than the interaction free energy itself. The amide sp2O-aromatic sp2C interaction is enthalpy-driven and entropically unfavorable, consistent with direct chemical interaction (e.g. lone pair-{pi}) while amide sp3C- and sp2C-aromatic sp2C interactions are entropy-driven and enthalpically unfavorable, consistent with hydrophobic effects. These findings are relevant for interactions involving {pi}-bonded sp2 atoms in protein processes.\n\nTable of Contents Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/548600v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1683bb4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@27db75org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b915ccorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1461b04_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Therefore, we developed a humanized IgG1 antibody targeting CD37, which was tailored to be afucosylated for enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (NNV024). In line with this, NNV024 induced three-fold more potent ADCC activity against patient-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells compared with anti-CD20 obinutuzumab. Moreover, NNV024 showed 2-fold higher ADCC activity than anti-CD20 rituximab and a recombinant version of DuoHexaBody-CD37 against both NHL and CLL cells. Survival was significantly longer after NNV024 treatment than with obinutuzumab in a mouse model. In addition, NNV024 showed a favourable plasma half-life in human FcRn transgenic mice of about 9-days, which was 2-fold longer than that of obinutuzumab and DuoHexaBody-CD37.

Co-expression of MPL with an MPN-linked CRT mutant (CRTDel52) reduces cell surface MPL expression, indicating the involvement of induced protein degradation, a better understanding of which could lead to new therapies. We show that lysosomal degradation is relevant to the turnover of both CRTDel52 and MPL. Drug-mediated activation of lysosomal degradation reduces CRTDel52 and MPL expression, with parallel inhibition of CRTDel52-induced cell proliferation and stem cell colony formation. Thus, reduced surface MPL, a marker of platelets from MPN patients with CRT mutations, results from mutant CRT-induced lysosomal degradation of MPL. Drug-induced activation of lysosomal degradation compromises the pathogenic effects of CRTDel52, which can be further exploited for therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Introduction and main objectivesIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive and irreversible interstitial lung disease (ILD), that increases dramatically in incidence and prevalence with age. While successful alveolar regeneration after injury depends on pulmonary capillary endothelial cells (PCEC) reprogramming, the steps involving PCEC during lung injury and resolution as well as the influence of aging are unknown.\n\nMethodsWe used single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics to compare the transcriptome of bleomycin-induced fibrotic lungs of young (7 weeks) and aged (18 months) mice, at 3 time points corresponding to the peak of fibrosis (14 days), regeneration (28 days) and resolution (60 days).\n\nResultsAmong the 44541 sequenced and annotated cells, we confirmed the transcriptomic dynamics of several cell types including macrophages, in which conversion is conserved between young and aged mice. We also found that lung injury shifts the transcriptomic profiles of recently described PCEC cell types, with 4 prominent signatures. These signatures are characterized by the overexpression of Lrg1 and are associated with pro-angiogenic signaling, potentially supported by adjacent cell types into the alveolar niche. These signatures were not equally maintained through the resolution process and between young and old animals. Moreover, part of this set of resolution-associated markers was also detected in pulmonary endothelial cells (ECs) from IPF samples. Finally, we found that aging also altered the transcriptome of general capillary cells (gCap) which display typical pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory features.\n\nConclusionsWe provide a detailed characterization of the cellular dynamics associated with fibrosis development and resolution in young and aged lungs and propose that age-associated alterations in specific PCEC subpopulations may interfere with the process of lung progenitor differentiation contributing to the persistent fibrotic process typical of human pathology.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPathogenic variants in plakophilin-2 (PKP2) cause arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a disease characterized by life-threatening arrhythmias and progressive cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure. No effective medical therapy is available to prevent and/or arrest the disease. We tested the hypothesis that AAV-mediated delivery of the human PKP2 gene to an adult mammalian heart deficient in PKP2 can arrest disease progression and significantly prolong survival.\n\nMethodsExperiments were carried out using a cardiac-specific, tamoxifen (TAM)-activated PKP2 knockout murine model (PKP2-cKO). The potential therapeutic, AAVrh.74-PKP2a (RP-A601), is a recombinant AAVrh.74 gene therapy viral vector encoding the human PKP2 variant A (PKP2a). AAVrh.74-PKP2a was delivered to adult mice by a single tail vein injection either before or after TAM-activated PKP2-cKO. PKP2 expression was confirmed by molecular and histopathologic analyses. Cardiac function and disease progression were monitored by survival analyses, echocardiography and electrocardiography.\n\nResultsConsistent with prior findings, loss of PKP2 expression caused 100% mortality within 50 days after TAM injection. In contrast, AAVrh.74-PKP2a-mediated PKP2a expression resulted in 100% survival for more than 5 months (at study termination). Echocardiographic analysis revealed that AAVrh.74-PKP2a prevented right ventricle dilation, arrested left ventricle functional decline, and mitigated arrhythmia burden. Molecular and histological analysis showed AAVrh.74-PKP2a- mediated transgene mRNA and protein expression and appropriate PKP2 localization at the cardiomyocyte intercalated disc. Importantly, therapeutic benefit was shown in mice receiving AAVrh.74-PKP2a after disease onset.\n\nConclusionThese preclinical data demonstrate the potential for AAVrh.74-PKP2a (RP-A601) as a therapeutic for PKP2-related ARVC in both early and more advanced stages of disease.",

    "abstract": "Obligate intracellular malaria parasites dramatically remodel their erythrocyte host through effector protein export to create a niche for survival. Most exported proteins contain a pentameric Plasmodium export element (PEXEL)/Host Targeting Motif that is cleaved in the parasite ER by the aspartic protease Plasmepsin V (PMV). This processing event exposes a mature N-terminus required for translocation into the host cell and is not known to occur in non-exported proteins. Here we report that the non-exported parasitophorous vacuole protein UIS2 contains a bona fide PEXEL motif that is processed in the P. falciparum blood-stage. While the N-termini of exported proteins containing the PEXEL and immediately downstream [~]10 residues is sufficient to mediate translocation into the RBC, the equivalent UIS2 N-terminus does not promote export of a reporter. Curiously, the UIS2 PEXEL contains an unusual aspartic acid at the fourth position which constitutes the extreme N-terminal residue following PEXEL cleavage (P1, RIL{tau}DE). Using a series of chimeric reporter fusions, we show that Asp at P1 is permissive for PMV processing but abrogates export. Moreover, mutation of this single UIS2 residue to alanine enables export, reinforcing that the mature N-terminus mediates export, not PEXEL processing per se. Prompted by this observation, we further show that PEXEL sequences in the N-termini of other non-exported rhoptry proteins are also processed, suggesting that PMV may be a more general secretory maturase than previously appreciated, similar to orthologs in related apicomplexans. Our findings provide new insight into the unique N-terminal constraints that mark proteins for export.\n\nImportanceHost erythrocyte remodeling by malaria parasite exported effector proteins is critical to parasite survival and disease pathogenesis. In the deadliest malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, most exported proteins undergo proteolytic maturation via recognition of the pentameric Plasmodium export element (PEXEL)/Host Targeting motif by the aspartic protease Plasmepsin V (PMV) which exposes a mature N-terminus that is conducive for export into the erythrocyte host cell. While PEXEL processing is considered a unique mark of exported proteins, we demonstrate PEXEL motifs are present and processed in non-exported proteins. Importantly, we show that specific residues at the variable fourth position of the PEXEL motif inhibit export despite being permissive for processing by PMV, reinforcing that features of the mature N-terminus, and not PEXEL cleavage, identify cargo for export cargo. This opens the door to further inquiry into the nature and evolution of the PEXEL motif.",

    "abstract": "Nitrification is associated with significant losses of fertilizer-derived ammonium from agroecosystems. The use of biological nitrification inhibitors (BNIs), in place of synthetic nitrification inhibitors (SNIs), holds a great potential to effectively reduce N losses and conforms with the current move towards ecological-intensified agriculture. Knowledge of the activity of BNIs to soil nitrifiers is limited and is mostly based on bioassays with a single Nitrosomonas europaea strain. We determined the in vitro activity of multiple plant-derived compounds as BNIs like (i) root-derived compounds (sakuranetin, MHPP, and zeanone); (ii) other phytochemicals (caffeic acid, quinic acid, chlorogenic acid and shikimic acid), and (iii) analogues of statins (simvastatin), triazoles (1-butyl-4-propyl-triazole, 1,4-dibutyltriazole) and zeanone (2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), on ecophysiologically and phylogenetically distinct soil-derived ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) (Nitrosospira multiformis and N. europaea), ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) (Candidatus Nitrosotalea sinensis and Candidatus Nitrosocosmicus franklandianus), and a nitrite-oxidizing bacterium (NOB) (Nitrobacter sp. NHB1). AOA were more sensitive than AOB to BNIs. Sensitivity within AOA group was BNI-dependent, unlike AOB for which N. multiformis was consistently more sensitive than N. europaea. Interestingly, several compounds were inhibitory to Nitrobacter sp. with MHPP and caffeic acid being more potent to the NOB compared to the AOB and AOA strains, an observation with potentially serious implications for soil quality and agricultural production. Overall, zeanone, MHPP and caffeic acid were the most potent BNIs towards AOB, zeanone and 2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone were the most effective compounds against AOA, while caffeic acid was the most potent BNI on Nitrobacter sp. We provide pioneering evidence for the activity range of multiple BNIs on soil nitrifiers, stress the need for revisiting the biological screening systems currently used for BNI determination and we sought for a more thorough monitoring of the impact of BNI candidates on a range of both target and non-target microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThe bacterial microbiota is well-recognised for its role in Clostridioides difficile colonisation and infection, while fungi and yeasts remain understudied. The aim of this study was to analyse the mycobiota and its interactions with the bacterial microbiota in light of C. difficile colonisation and infection.\n\nMethodsThe mycobiota was profiled by ITS2 sequencing of faecal DNA from infected patients (CDI; n = 29), asymptomatically colonised patients (CDC; n = 38) and hospitalised controls with C. difficile negative stool culture (Controls; n = 38). Previously published 16S rRNA gene sequencing data of the same cohort were used additionally for machine learning and fungal-bacterial network analysis.\n\nResultsCDI patients were characterised by a significantly higher abundance of Candida spp. (MD 0.270 {+/-} 0.089, P = 0.002) and Candida albicans (MD 0.165 {+/-} 0.082, P = 0.023) compared to Controls. Additionally, they were deprived of Aspergillus spp. (MD -0.067 {+/-} 0.026, P = 0.000) and Penicillium spp. (MD -0.118 {+/-} 0.043, P = 0.000) compared to CDC patients. Network analysis revealed a positive association between several fungi and bacteria in CDI and CDC, although the analysis did not reveal a direct association between Clostridioides spp. and fungi. Furthermore, the microbiota machine learning model outperformed the models based on the mycobiota and the joint microbiota-mycobiota model. The microbiota classifier successfully distinguished CDI from CDC (AUROC = 0.884) and CDI from Controls (AUROC = 0.905). Blautia and Bifidobacterium were marker genera associated with CDC patients and Controls.\n\nConclusionsThe gut mycobiota differs between CDI, CDC, and Controls, and may affect Clostridioides spp. through indirect interactions. The identification of bacterial marker genera associated with CDC and Controls warrants further investigation. Although the mycobiotas predictive value of C. difficile status was low, fungal-bacterial interactions might be considered when diagnosing and treating C. difficile infection.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian cells are frequently exposed to mechanical and biochemical stresses resulting in plasma membrane injuries. Repair mechanisms rapidly reseal the plasma membrane to restore homeostasis and prevent cell death. In the present work, a silencing RNA (siRNA) screen was performed to uncover the plasma membrane repair mechanisms of cells injured by the bacterial pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O (LLO). The screen identified a novel role for the septin cytoskeleton in mediating plasma membrane repair. Upon cell injury, the septin cytoskeleton partially dissociates from actin stress fibers and remodels with cortical F-actin and myosin-II to form loop (and ring)-like domains that protrude from the cell surface. These domains strictly colocalize with the calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein, annexin A2 (ANXA2). Importantly, formation of the SEPT/F-actin/ANXA2 domains are dependent on SEPT7 expression and is functionally correlated with the plasma membrane repair efficiency. Our studies open new research avenues by identifying a novel role for the septin cytoskeleton in remodeling the plasma membrane for its repair.\n\nSUMMARYPlasma membrane repair is a fundamental homeostatic process. Excessive damage or defective plasma membrane repair is associated with numerous pathological conditions. This work identifies a novel function of the septin cytoskeleton in remodeling the plasma membrane for its repair.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria transport is crucial for mitochondria distribution in axons and is mediated by kinesin-1-based anterograde and dynein-based retrograde motor complexes. While Miro and Milton/TRAK were identified as key adaptors between mitochondria and kinesin-1, recent studies suggest the presence of additional mechanisms. In C. elegans, ric-7 is the only single gene described so far, other than kinesin-1, that is absolutely required for axonal mitochondria localization. Using CRISPR engineering in C. elegans, we find that Miro is important but is not essential for anterograde traffic, whereas it is required for retrograde traffic. Both the endogenous RIC-7 and kinesin-1 act at the leading end to transport mitochondria anterogradely. RIC-7 recruitment to mitochondria requires its N-terminal domain and partially relies on MIRO-1, whereas RIC-7 accumulation at the leading end depends on its disordered region, kinesin-1 and metaxin2. We conclude that polarized transport complexes containing kinesin-1 and RIC-7 form at the leading edge of mitochondria, and that these complexes are required for anterograde axonal transport.\n\nSummary statementAnterograde transport of axonal mitochondria is critical for maintenance of the mitochondria pool and neuronal health. Wu et al. show that the endogenous kinesin-1 and RIC-7 localize at the leading end of mitochondria to drive axonal anterograde transport in vivo.",

However, the synchronization of these strategies at the entire community level is untested.

Most guilds consistently respond to these drivers through both direct and trophically-mediated effects, resulting in a  slow-fast axis at the level of the entire community.

    "abstract": "FoxP3 is a transcription factor (TF) essential for development of regulatory T cells (Tregs), a branch of T cells that suppress excessive inflammation and autoimmunity1-5. Molecular mechanisms of FoxP3, however, remain elusive. We here show that FoxP3 utilizes the Forkhead domain--a DNA binding domain (DBD) that is commonly thought to function as a monomer or dimer--to form a higher-order multimer upon binding to TnG repeat microsatellites. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of FoxP3 in complex with T3G repeats reveals a ladder-like architecture, where two double-stranded DNA molecules form the two \"side rails\" bridged by five pairs of FoxP3 molecules forming \"rungs\". Each FoxP3 subunit occupies TGTTTGT within the repeats in the manner indistinguishable from that of FoxP3 bound to the Forkhead consensus motif (FKHM; TGTTTAC). Mutations in the \"intra-rung\" interface impair TnG repeat recognition, DNA bridging and cellular functions of FoxP3, all without affecting FKHM binding. FoxP3 can tolerate variable \"inter-rung\" spacings, explaining its broad specificity for TnG repeat-like sequences in vivo and in vitro. Both FoxP3 orthologs and paralogs show similar TnG repeat recognition and DNA bridging. These findings thus reveal a new mode of DNA recognition that involves TF homo-multimerization and DNA bridging, and further implicates microsatellites in transcriptional regulation and diseases.",

    "abstract": "The acclimation of cyanobacteria to iron deficiency is crucial for their survival in natural environments. In response to iron deficiency, many cyanobacterial species induce the production of a pigment-protein complex called IsiA. IsiA proteins associate with photosystem I (PSI) and can function as light-harvesting antennas or dissipate excess energy. They may also serve as Chl storage during iron limitation. In this study we examined the functional role of IsiA in cells of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 grown under iron limitation conditions by measuring the cellular IsiA content and its capability to transfer energy to PSI. We specifically test the effect of the oligomeric state of PSI by comparing wild-type (WT) Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to mutants lacking specific subunits of PSI, namely PsaL/PsaI ({Delta}psaL mutant) and PsaF/PsaJ ({Delta}FIJL). Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that IsiA formed functional PSI3-IsiA18 supercomplexes, wherein IsiA effectively transfers energy to PSI on a timescale of 10 ps at room temperature - measured in isolated complexes and in vivo - confirming the primary role of IsiA as an accessory light-harvesting antenna to PSI. However, a significant fraction (40%) remained unconnected to PSI, supporting the notion of a dual functional role of IsiA. Cells with monomeric PSI under iron deficiency contained only 3-4 IsiA complexes bound to PSI. Together the results show that IsiA is capable of transferring energy to trimeric and monomeric PSI but to varying degrees and that the acclimatory production of IsiA under iron stress is controlled by its ability to perform its light-harvesting function.",

    "abstract": "Wheat blast caused by Pyricularia oryzae Triticum pathotype (MoT) has been transmitted from South America to Bangladesh and Zambia and is now spreading in these countries. To prepare against its further spread to Asian countries, we introduced Rmg8, a gene for resistance to wheat blast, into a Japanese elite cultivar, Chikugoizumi (ChI), through recurrent backcrosses, and established ChI near-isogenic lines, #2-1-10 with the Rmg8/Rmg8 genotype and #4-2-10 with the rmg8/rmg8 genotype. A molecular analysis suggested that at least 96.6% of the #2-1-10 genome was derived from the recurrent parent ChI. The #2-1-10 line was resistant to MoT not only in primary leaves at the seedling stage but also in spikes and flag leaves at the heading stage. The strength of the resistance in spikes of this Rmg8 carrier was comparable to that of a carrier of the 2NS segment which has been the only one genetic resource released to farmers field for wheat blast resistance. On the other hand, the 2NS resistance was not expressed on leaves at the seedling stage nor flag leaves at the heading stage. Considering that leaf blast has been increasingly reported and regarded as an important inoculum source for spike blast, Rmg8 expressed at both the seedling and heading stages, or more strictly in both leaves and spikes, is suggested to be useful to prevent the spread of MoT in Asia and Africa.",

    "abstract": "Atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3), formerly referred to as CXCR7, is considered to be an interesting drug target. In this study we report on the synthesis, pharmacological characterization and radiolabeling of VUF15485, a new ACKR3 small-molecule agonist, that will serve as an important new tool to study this {beta}-arrestin-biased chemokine receptor. VUF15485 binds with nanomolar affinity (pIC50 = 8.3) to human ACKR3, as measured in [125I]CXCL12 competition binding experiments. Moreover, in a BRET-based {beta}-arrestin2 recruitment assay VUF15485 acts as an ACKR3 agonist with high potency (pEC50 = 7.6) and shows a similar extent of receptor activation compared to CXCL12 when using a newly developed, FRET-based ACKR3 conformational sensor. Moreover, the ACKR3 agonist VUF15485 was tested against a (atypical) chemokine receptor panel (agonist and antagonist mode) and proves to be selective for ACKR3. VUF15485 was subsequently labeled with tritium at one of its methoxy groups affording [3H]VUF15485. The small-molecule agonist radioligand binds saturably and with high affinity to human ACKR3 (Kd = 8.2 nM). [3H]VUF15485 shows rapid binding kinetics and consequently a short residence time (RT < 2 min) for its binding to ACKR3. Displacement of [3H]VUF15485 binding to membranes of HEK293T cells, transiently expressing ACKR3, with a number of CXCR3, CXCR4 or ACKR3 small-molecule ligands confirmed the ACKR3 profile of the [3H]VUF15485 binding site. Interestingly, the chemokine ligands CXCL11 and CXCL12 are not able to displace the binding of [3H]VUF15485 to ACKR3. The radiolabeled VUF15485 was subsequently used to evaluate its binding pocket. Site-directed mutagenesis and docking studies using a recently solved cryo-EM structure propose VUF15485 to bind in the major and the minor binding pocket of ACKR3.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen growing interest in characterizing the properties of regional brain dynamics and their relationship to other features of brain structure and function. In particular, multiple studies have observed regional differences in the \"timescale\" over which activity fluctuates during periods of quiet rest. In the cerebral cortex, these timescales have been associated with both local circuit properties as well as patterns of inter-regional connectivity, including the extent to which each region exhibits widespread connectivity to other brain areas. In the current study, we build on prior observations of an association between connectivity and dynamics in the cerebral cortex by investigating the relationship between BOLD fMRI timescales and the modular organization of structural and functional brain networks. We characterize network community structure across multiple scales and find that longer timescales are associated with greater within-community functional connectivity and diverse structural connectivity. We also replicate prior observations of a positive correlation between timescales and structural connectivity degree. Finally, we find evidence for preferential functional connectivity between cortical areas with similar timescales. We replicate these findings in an independent dataset. These results contribute to our understanding of functional brain organization and structure-function relationships in the human brain, and support the notion that regional differences in cortical dynamics may in part reflect the topological role of each region within macroscale brain networks.",

    "abstract": "Bilirubin-induced neurological damage (BIND), which is also known as Kernicterus, occurs as a consequence of defects in the bilirubin conjugation machinery, thus resulting in unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accumulation. Severe hyperbilirubinemia can be caused by a mutation within the UGT1A1 encoding gene. This mutation has a direct contribution towards bilirubin conjugation leading to Kernicterus as a symptom of Crigler Najjar Syndromes (CNS1, CNS2) and Gilbert syndrome, which results in permanent neurological sequelae. In this comparative study, we used human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)-derived 3D-brain organoids to model BIND in vitro and unveil the molecular basis of the detrimental effects of UCB in the developing human brain. hiPSC-derived from healthy and CNS patients were differentiated into day-20 brain organoids, these were then stimulated with 200nM UCB. Analyses at 24- and 72-hrs post-treatment point at UCB-induced neuro-inflammation in both cell lines. Transcriptome and associated KEGG and Gene Ontology analyses unveiled activation of distinct inflammatory pathways such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, MAPK signaling, calcium signaling, NF{kappa}B activation. Furthermore, both mRNA expression and secretome analysis confirmed an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL6 and IL8 upon UCB stimulation. In summary, this novel study has provided insights into how a human iPSC-derived 3D-brain organoid model can serve as a prospective platform for studying the etiology of BIND-Kernicterus.",

Sounds consisted of living (animal and human vocalizations) and manmade objects (e.g. household objects, instruments, and tools). Despite similar recognition behavior, AEPs strikingly differed between full-term and preterm children.

Over the 108-224ms post-stimulus period, full-term children showed stronger AEPs in response to living objects, whereas preterm born children showed the reverse pattern; i.e. stronger AEPs in response to manmade objects. Differential brain activity between semantic categories could reliably classify children according to their preterm status. Moreover, this opposing pattern of differential responses to semantic categories of sounds was also observed in source estimations within a network of occipital, temporal and frontal regions.

    "abstract": "The ocular lens, along with the cornea, focuses light on the retina to generate sharp images. Opacification of the lens, or cataract, is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. Presently, the best approach for cataract treatment is to surgically remove the diseased lens and replace it with an artificial implant. Although effective, this is costly and can have post-surgical complications. Toward identifying alternate treatments, it is imperative to develop organoid models relevant for lens studies and anti-cataract drug screening. Here, we demonstrate that by culturing mouse lens epithelial cells under defined 3-dimensional (3D) culture conditions, it is possible to generate organoids that display optical properties and recapitulate many aspects of lens organization at the tissue, cellular and transcriptomic levels. These 3D cultured lens organoids can be rapidly produced in large amounts. High-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on specific organoid regions isolated by laser capture microdissection (LCM) and immunofluorescence assays demonstrate that these lens organoids display spatiotemporal expression of key lens genes, e.g., Jag1, Pax6, Prox1, Hsf4 and Cryab. Further, these lens organoids are amenable to induction of opacities. Finally, knockdown of a cataract-linked RNA-binding protein encoding gene, Celf1, induces opacities in these organoids, indicating their use in rapidly screening for genes functionally relevant to lens biology and cataract. In sum, this lens organoid model represents a compelling new tool to advance the understanding of lens biology and pathology, and can find future use in the rapid screening of compounds aimed at preventing and/or treating cataract.",

The optimization of in vitro cultivation begins with an understanding of hormonal balance and its implications in production. This work aimed to regenerate shoots from seeds germination of the Phalaenopsis Golden Peoker  BL HCC / AOS under exogenous auxin and cytokinin influence. To do so, naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), 6-benzyladenine (BA), and Kinetin (Kin) were added to the culture medium to induce organogenesis, totaling 17 treatments with eight replications per treatment. The variables number of shoots (NS), shoot length (SL), and presence of root primordia (RP) were evaluated. A non-parametric test (the Friedman test), followed by the Bonferroni procedure, was used to compare the different groups. Hence, the MS medium provided 610 complete plants after 90 days of cultivation. The T6 treatment had the highest median NS (1.5 shoots per plant at 15 days) and SL. At 30 days, the highest NS was for the T16, with 6.15 shoots per plant; for SL, the one that stood out was the T9. Regarding RP in shoots, the best treatments were T2, T3, T9, T10, and T17, with the formation of RP at 15 days, remaining these treatments at 30 days. In conclusion, the T9 is the most suitable for an efficient protocol reproduction, as it showed the best plant development.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS (MANDATORY)O_LIThe auxin and cytokinin balance promoted shoot regeneration.\nC_LIO_LIThe BA and NAA combined promoted the shoot formation of Phalaenopsis Golden Peoker  BL HCC/AOS.\nC_LIO_LIThe use of KIN isolated showed hyperhydricity and malformation in shoots of Phalaenopsis.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) encode movement kinematics in their population firing rates. Firing rate suppression is hypothesized to disinhibit neurons in the cerebellar nuclei, promoting adaptive movement adjustments. Debates persist, however, about whether a second disinhibitory mechanism, PC simple spike synchrony, is a relevant population code. We addressed this question by relating PC rate and synchrony patterns recorded with high density probes, to mouse reach kinematics. We discovered behavioral correlates of PC synchrony that align with a known causal relationship between activity in cerebellar output. Reach deceleration was positively correlated with both Purkinje firing rate decreases and synchrony, consistent with both mechanisms disinhibiting target neurons, which are known to adjust reach velocity. Direct tests of the contribution of each coding scheme to nuclear firing using dynamic clamp, combining physiological rate and synchrony patterns ex vivo, confirmed that physiological levels of PC simple spike synchrony are highly facilitatory for nuclear firing. These findings suggest that PC firing rate and synchrony collaborate to exert fine control of movement.",

    "abstract": "The brain functions as a prediction machine, utilizing an internal model of the world to anticipate sensations and the outcomes of our actions. Discrepancies between expected and actual events, referred to as prediction errors, are leveraged to update the internal model and guide our attention towards unexpected events1-10. Despite the importance of prediction error signals for various neural computations across multiple brain regions, surprisingly little is known about the neural circuit mechanisms responsible for their implementation. Here we describe a thalamocortical disinhibitory circuit required for generating sensory prediction errors in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). Using calcium imaging with optogenetic manipulations as mice traverse a familiar virtual environment, we show that violation of animals predictions by an unexpected visual stimulus preferentially boosts responses of layer 2/3 V1 neurons most selective for that stimulus. Prediction errors specifically amplify the unexpected visual input, rather than representing a non-specific surprise or difference signal about how the visual input deviates from animals predictions. Selective amplification of unexpected visual input is implemented by a cooperative mechanism requiring thalamic input from the pulvinar, and cortical vasoactive-intestinal-peptide-expressing (VIP) inhibitory interneurons. In response to prediction errors, VIP neurons inhibit a specific subpopulation of somatostatin-expressing (SOM) inhibitory interneurons that gate excitatory pulvinar input to V1, resulting in specific pulvinar-driven response-amplification of the most stimulus-selective neurons in V1. Therefore, the brain prioritizes unpredicted sensory information by selectively increasing the salience of unpredicted sensory features through the synergistic interaction of thalamic input and neocortical disinhibitory circuits.",

    "abstract": "In nature, biological systems such as the human brain are characterized by complex and non-linear dynamics. One way of quantifying signal complexity is Multiscale Entropy (MSE), which is suitable for structures with long-range correlation at different time scales. In developmental neuroscience, MSE can be taken as an index of brain maturation, and can differentiate between healthy and pathological development. In our current work, we explored the developmental trends of MSE on the basis of 30 simultaneous EEG - fNIRS recordings in premature infants between 27 and 34 weeks of gestational age (wGA). To explore potential factors impacting MSE, we determined the relation between MSE and the EEG Power Spectrum Density (PSD) and Spontaneous Activity Transients (SATs). As a result, via wGA, the MSE calculated on the EEG increases, thus reflecting the maturational processes in the brain networks, whereas in the fNIRS, MSE decreases, which might indicate a maturation of the brain blood supply. Moreover, we propose that the EEG power in the beta band (13-30 Hz) might be the main contributor to MSE in the EEG. Finally, we highlight the importance of SATs in determining MSE as calculated from the fNIRS recordings.\n\nHighlightsBiological systems show complex and non-linear dynamics. With Multiscale Entropy (MSE) we studied simultaneous EEG-fNIRS in premature infants. MSE in the EEG increases over gestational age, MSE in the fNIRS decreases. EEG power spectrum density and spontaneous activity transients contribute to MSE.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental feature of the cerebral cortex is the ability to rapidly turn on and off maintained activity within ensembles of neurons through recurrent excitation balanced by inhibition. Here we demonstrate that reduction of the h-current, which is especially prominent in pyramidal cell dendrites, strongly increases the ability of local cortical networks to generate maintained recurrent activity. Reduction of the h-current resulted in hyperpolarization and increase in input resistance of both the somata and apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal cells, while strongly increasing the dendrosomatic transfer of low (<20 Hz) frequencies, causing an increased responsiveness to dynamic clamp-induced recurrent network-like activity injected into the dendrites and substantially increasing the duration of spontaneous Up states. We propose that modulation of the h-current may strongly control the ability of cortical networks to generate recurrent persistent activity and the formation and dissolution of neuronal ensembles.",

Yet little is known about the cell-type-specific mechanisms by which VP projections to VTA drive behavior. Here, we found that both VP GABA and Glut neurons were activated during approach to reward or delivery of an aversive stimulus. Stimulation of VP GABA neurons inhibited VTA GABA, but activated dopamine (DA) and glutamate neurons. Remarkably, this cell-type-specific recruitment was behavior-contingent such that VTA recruitment was inhibited when evoked by the subjects own action.

However, VP Glut neurons evoked DA in reward-associated ventromedial nucleus accumbens (NAc), but reduced DA in aversion-associated dorsomedial NAc. These findings show how heterogeneous VP cell types can engage VTA cell types to shape approach and avoidance behaviors.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIVP GABA and Glut neurons are activated by approach to reward and aversive stimuli\nC_LIO_LIVP GABA and Glut neurons oppositely affect VTA GABA, both activate VTA DA and Glut\nC_LIO_LIVP Glut neurons activate DA release in ventral NAc but inhibit DA from dorsal NAc\nC_LIO_LIVTA DA responses to VP GABA activity are inhibited by the subjects own action\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Mutations can alter the short-term fitness of an organism, as well as the rates and benefits of future mutations. While numerous examples of these evolvability modifiers have been observed in rapidly adapting microbial populations, existing theory struggles to predict when they will be favored by natural selection. Here, we develop a mathematical framework for predicting the fates of new mutations that modify the rates and benefits of future mutations in linked genomic regions. We derive analytical expressions showing how the fixation probabilities of these variants depend on the size of the population and the diversity of competing mutations. We find that competition between linked mutations can dramatically enhance selection for modifiers that increase the benefits of future mutations, even when they impose a strong direct cost on fitness. Conversely, we find that relatively modest direct benefits can be sufficient to drive an evolutionary dead-end to fixation. Our results suggest that subtle differences in evolvability could play an important role in shaping the long-term success of genetic variants in rapidly evolving microbial populations.",

In this study, we expand the capabilities of YESS by transferring its functional components to integrative plasmids. The YESS integrative system yields uniform protein expression and protease activities in various configurations, allows one to integrate activity reporters at two independent loci and to split the system between integrative and centromeric plasmids. We characterize these integrative reporters with two viral proteases, Tobacco etch virus (TEVp) and 3-chymotrypsin like protease (3CLpro), in terms of coefficient of variance, signal-to-noise ratio and fold-activation.

    "abstract": "The complexity of the human shoulder girdle enables the large mobility of the upper extremity, but also introduces instability of the glenohumeral (GH) joint. Shoulder movements are generated by coordinating large superficial and deeper stabilizing muscles spanning numerous degrees-of-freedom. How shoulder muscles are coordinated to stabilize the movement of the GH joint remains widely unknown. Musculoskeletal simulations are powerful tools to gain insights into the actions of individual muscles and particularly of those that are difficult to measure. In this study, we analyze how enforcement of GH joint stability in a musculoskeletal model affects the estimates of individual muscle activity during shoulder movements. To estimate both muscle activity and GH stability from recorded shoulder movements, we developed a Rapid Muscle Redundancy (RMR) solver to include constraints on joint reaction forces (JRFs) from a musculoskeletal model. The RMR solver yields muscle activations and joint forces by minimizing the weighted sum of squared-activations, while matching experimental motion. We implemented three new features: first, computed muscle forces include active and passive fiber contributions; second, muscle activation rates are enforced to be physiological, and third, JRFs are efficiently formulated as linear functions of activations. Muscle activity from the RMR solver without GH stability was not different from the computed muscle control (CMC) algorithm and electromyography of superficial muscles. The efficiency of the solver enabled us to test 3600 trials sampled within the uncertainty of the experimental movements to test the differences in muscle activity with and without GH joint stability enforced. We found that enforcing GH stability significantly increases the estimated activity of the rotator cuff muscles but not of most superficial muscles. Therefore, a comparison of shoulder model muscle activity to EMG measurements of superficial muscles alone is insufficient to validate the activity of rotator cuff muscles estimated from musculoskeletal models.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in precision oncology is to identify targetable cancer vulnerabilities in individual patients. Modelling high-throughput omics data in biological networks allows identifying key molecules and processes of tumorigenesis. Traditionally, network inference methods rely on many samples to contain sufficient information for learning and predicting gene interactions for a group of patients. However, to implement patient-tailored approaches in precision oncology, we need to interpret omics data at the level of the individual patient. Several single-sample network inference methods have been developed that infer biological networks for an individual sample from bulk RNA-seq data. However, only a limited comparison of these methods has been made. Moreover, many methods rely on  normal tissue samples as reference point for the tumor samples, which is not always available.\n\nHere, we conducted an evaluation of the single-sample network inference methods SSN, LIONESS, iENA, CSN and SSPGI using expression profiles of lung and brain cancer cell lines from the CCLE database. The methods constructed networks with distinct network topologies, as observed by edge weight distributions and other network characteristics. Further, hub gene analyses revealed different degrees of subtype-specificity across methods. Single-sample networks were able to distinguish between tumor subtypes, as exemplified by edge weight clustering, enrichment of known subtype-specific driver genes among hub gene sets, and differential node importance. Finally, we show that single-sample networks correlate better to other omics data from the same cell line as compared to aggregate networks. Our results point to the important role of single-sample network inference in precision medicine.",
