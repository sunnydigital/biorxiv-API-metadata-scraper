    "abstract": "Speciation and sperm competition have been shown to be the major driving forces for sperm morphology variation, swimming velocity and metabolism. We used light microscopy to measure sperm traits and nLC-MS/MS to detect proteomic variation in three species of rodents - promiscuous Apodemus flavicollis, less promiscuous Microtus arvalis, and the least promiscuous Mus musculus musculus. We show that the length of sperm apical hook containing the acrosome is the most variable trait and that this variation is reflected by proteomes on interspecific and intraspecific levels. Thus, we provide potential markers of selection such as Ldhc (in Mus and Apodemus) for long acrosomes which is a gene coding L-lactate dehydrogenase that is involved in sperm motility and Spaca1, which is important in sperm-oocyte fusion), and e.g. Mup17 for short acrosomes - a gene coding a Major urinary protein that likely chelates lipophilic compounds after spermiogenesis. In short, longer acrosomes are characteristic of proteins involved in fertilisation and gluconeogenesis, while shorter acrosomes contain more cytoskeletal proteins important for spermiogenesis. For the first time, we demonstrate that there is an innate and evolvable variability in sperm morphology and corresponding proteomes within species that can be driven by sperm competition to species-specific reproductive optima.\n\nSummary statementWe show that interspecific and intraspecific variation in sperm morphology traits are detectable on proteomic level thus providing markers of selection due to sperm competition.",

    "abstract": "Blood progenitors are regulated by a variety of signals from their environment. In the Drosophila lymph gland (LG), the Posterior Signalling Center (PSC) acts as a stem cell niche striking a balance between progenitors and differentiated blood cells. While the response of blood progenitors to extrinsic signals is well characterized, their ability to respond to cell intrinsic cues is unexplored. Autophagy is one such intrinsic cellular process that maintains cellular homeostasis by removing unnecessary or dysfunctional cell components through autophagic degradation and recycling. Here, we show that autophagy plays a critical role in regulating blood cell homeostasis in the lymph gland. General control non-derepressible 5 (Gcn5), a histone acetyltransferase is expressed in all the cellular subsets of the LG and modulation of Gcn5 levels in various cellular subsets of the LG perturbs LG homeostasis. Gcn5 through its known non-histone acetylation target, TFEB controls autophagic flux thereby regulating hematopoiesis. Additionally, we demonstrate that modulation of mTORC1 activity can perturb hematopoiesis. We show that Gcn5 acts as a nutrient sensor and mTORC1 activity regulates Gcn5. mTORC1 over-rides the effect exerted by Gcn5 in regulating LG hematopoiesis. Together, our findings indicate that Gcn5 - mTORC1 - TFEB signaling axis mediated control of autophagy is required for maintaining blood cell homeostasis in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal inversions can play an important role in divergence and reproductive isolation by building and maintaining distinct allelic combinations between evolutionary lineages. Alternatively, they can take the form of balanced polymorphisms that segregate within populations over time until one arrangement becomes fixed. Many questions remain about how these different inversion polymorphisms arise, how the mechanisms responsible for their long-term maintenance interact, and ultimately how they contribute to speciation. The long-snouted seahorse (Hippocampus guttulatus) is known to be subdivided into partially isolated lineages and marine-lagoon ecotypes differentiated by structural variation. Here, we aim to characterise these differences along the entire genome, and to reconstruct their history and role in ecotype formation. We generated a near chromosome-level reference genome assembly and described genome-wide patterns of diversity and divergence through the analysis of 112 whole-genome sequences from Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Black Sea populations. Combined with linked-read sequencing data, we found evidence for two megabase-scale chromosomal inversions showing contrasted allele frequency patterns across the species range. We reveal that these inversions represent ancient intraspecific polymorphisms, one being likely maintained by divergent selection, and the other by associative overdominance. Haplotype combinations characterising Mediterranean ecotypes also suggest the existence of potential interactions between the two inversions, possibly driven by environment-dependent fitness effects. Lastly, we detected gene flux eroding divergence between inverted alleles at varying levels between the two inversions, with a likely impact on their long-term dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the CRISPR-RfxCas13d (CasRx) system was proven to induce efficient mRNA knockdown in animal embryos. Here we compared the efficiency of CasRx-based RNA depletion with that of Cas9-mediated DNA targeting under the same conditions, using automated robotic and manual injection methods. As a proof-of-principle target, we used the no tail (tbxta) gene in zebrafish embryos, for which knockdown and knockout embryonic phenotypes were easy to be scored. Both Cas9 and CasRx systems induced loss of function phenotypes of tbxta gene. Higher percentage of severe phenotype was observed using Cas9 protein compared to the mRNA while the efficiency was similar in terms of Cas13d protein and mRNA. In addition, both the robotic and manual injection approaches yielded similar percentages of phenotypes and mortality rates. Therefore, our study not only showcases the potential of RNA-targeting CRISPR effectors for precise and potent gene knockdown, but also emphasizes automated microinjection in zebrafish embryos as an excellent alternative to manual methods for achieving gene knockdown at a high throughput level.",

    "abstract": "The target of most cancer chemotherapeutic agents is to drive cancer cells toward death. A fine balance between anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins is needed to maintain cellular homeostasis. Any shift favoring the pro-apoptotic ones is needed to drive cellular death in cancer chemotherapy. However, anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL bind with pro-apoptotic proteins to hinder apoptosis mechanisms. Overexpression of these anti-apoptotic proteins lead to several cancers by preventing apoptosis. In this study, molecular docking, ADMET predictions, and molecular dynamics simulations were performed for the identification of potent inhibitors of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 with compounds of Morus alba. Our study discovered that Quercetin-3-(6-Malonylglucoside) and Epigallocatechin gallate recorded excellent binding affinity with Bcl-2. Therefore, we conclude that compounds of Morus alba should be subjected to further experimental studies (in vitro and in vivo) in order to confirm the findings that they could be used as better options in cancer chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Structure prediction of protein complexes has improved significantly with AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold-multimer (AFM), but only 60% of dimers are accurately predicted. A way to improve the predictions is to inject noise to generate more diverse predictions. However, thousands of predictions are needed to obtain a few that are accurate in difficult cases. Here, we learn a bias to the MSA representation that improves the predictions by performing gradient descent through the AFM network. We effectively denoise the MSA profile, similar to how a blurry image would be sharpened. We demonstrate the performance on seven difficult targets from CASP15 and increase the average MMscore to 0.76 compared to 0.63 with AFM. We evaluate the procedure on 334 protein complexes where AFM fails and demonstrate an increased success rate (MMscore>0.75) of 8% on these hard targets. Our protocol, AFProfile, provides a way to direct predictions towards a defined target function guided by the MSA. We expect gradient descent over the MSA to be useful for different tasks, such as generating alternative conformations. AFProfile is freely available at: https://github.com/patrickbryant1/AFProfile",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOsteoarthritis (OA) is a multi-factorial disease that is strongly associated with aging. As the molecular mechanisms underpinning the pathogenesis of this disease are partially unclear, there are no disease-modifying drugs to combat OA. The mechanosensitive channel Pannexin 3 (PANX3) has been shown to promote cartilage loss during posttraumatic OA. In contrast, the ablation of Panx3 in male mice results in spontaneous full-thickness cartilage lesions at 24 months of age. Additionally, while protected from traumatic intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, Panx3 knockout (KO) mice show signs of IVD disease with altered disc mechanics. Whether the deleterious effects of ablating Panx3 in aging is the result from accumulated mechanical damage is unknown.\n\nMethodsMale and female wildtype (WT) and global Panx3 KO C57Bl6 mice were aged to 18 months of age. Mice were then randomized to sedentary (SED) or forced treadmill running (FEX) for 6 weeks (N = 5-14). Knee joint tissues including patellar tendon, quadriceps and distal patellar enthesis, and synovium were analyzed histologically, along with lumbar spine IVDs.\n\nResultsApproximately half of male and female Panx3 KO mice developed full-thickness cartilage lesions, severe synovitis, and ectopic fibrocartilage deposition and calcification of the knee joints. Additionally, Panx3 KO mice with severe OA show signs of quadriceps and patellar enthesitis, characterized by bone and marrow formation. Forced treadmill running did not seem to exacerbate these phenotypes in male or female Panx3 KO mice; however, it may have contributed to the development of lateral compartment OA. The IVDs of aged Panx3 KO mice displayed no apparent differences to control mice, and forced treadmill running had no overt effects in either genotype.\n\nConclusionAged Panx3 KO mice show histological features of late-stage primary OA including full-thickness cartilage erosion, subchondral bone thickening, and severe synovitis. This data suggests the deletion of Panx3 is deleterious to synovial joint health in aging.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrevious research has revealed the logical mapping of fascicles in both human somatic and pig vagus nerves, but the organization of fascicles within the human vagus nerve remains largely unknown. Understanding its fascicular arrangement would significantly advance our knowledge of the autonomic nervous system and facilitate studies and application of selective vagus nerve stimulation to avoid off-target effects. The purpose of this study was to trace the thoracic branches of human vagus nerves, investigate their fascicular organization, and analyze the nerves histologically and morphologically.\n\nMethodsBoth left and right vagus nerves were dissected from human cadavers, preserving the cardiac, recurrent laryngeal, and pulmonary branches. The nerves were prepared, scanned using microCT, and the fascicles segmented and traced from their branching points. Histology and immunohistochemistry were performed for morphological analysis and validation of the microCT segmentation. The data was then analyzed and compared between nerves.\n\nResultsThe organization of the cardiac, pulmonary, and recurrent laryngeal fascicles was observed for a short distance from their entry point into the nerves. Initially, left vagus nerves showed merging of cardiac and pulmonary fascicles, while the recurrent laryngeal fascicles remained separate. In right vagus nerves, the cardiac fascicles merged with both pulmonary and recurrent laryngeal fascicles. MicroCT imaging limitations prevented visualization and tracing of fiber organization within merged fascicles. Immunohistochemistry and morphological analysis revealed that right vagus nerves were larger and had more fascicles than the left and fascicle counts varied along the nerve, indicating anastomoses. The superior cardiac branch was separate from other fascicles near the VNS cuff placement.\n\nConclusionsIt is possible that organ-specific fibers may still retain some spatial organization despite most fascicles being merged at cervical level. However, fiber tracing and in vivo studies could provide valuable information beyond microCT to resolve this further. The separate superior cardiac fascicles offer potential for targeted neuromodulation of the heart, benefiting conditions like myocardial infarction, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. Overall, the study provides insights into the morphology and anatomy of human vagus nerves. Our findings thereby contribute to the development of selective vagus nerve stimulation strategies for more precise autonomic regulation.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that dendritic cell (DC) activation and function are underpinned by profound changes in cellular metabolism. Several studies indicate that the ability of DCs to promote tolerance is dependent on catabolic metabolism. The AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) is a central nutrient and energy sensor whose activation promotes catabolism while inhibiting ATP-consuming anabolic pathways. Yet the contribution of AMPK activation to DC tolerogenicity remains unknown. Here, we show that AMPK activation renders human monocyte-derived DCs tolerogenic as evidenced by an enhanced ability to drive differentiation of regulatory T cells, a process dependent on increased RALDH activity. This is accompanied by a number of distinct metabolic changes, in particular increased breakdown of glycerophospholipids, enhanced mitochondrial fission-dependent fatty acid oxidation, and upregulated glucose catabolism. This metabolic rewiring is functionally important as we found interference with these metabolic processes to reduce to various degrees AMPK-induced RALDH activity as well as the tolerogenic capacity of moDCs. Altogether, our findings reveal a key role for AMPK signaling in shaping DC tolerogenicity, and suggest that AMPK may serve as new target to direct DC-driven immune responses in therapeutic settings.",

We show that either Akt1 overexpression or Akt2 chemical inhibition have similar effects on intestinal epithelial cells, enhancing the permeability of the epithelial barrier and affecting the expression and/or intracellular localization of the tight junctions proteins (TJP) whereas Akt1 inhibition or Akt2 overexpression show the opposite results. Akt1 overexpression or Akt2 inhibition also promotes activation of {beta}-Catenin and Lgr5. Moreover, mouse intestinal organoids treated ex vivo with Akt1 inhibitors present dissembled and disorganized structures that mimic IBD histological features. Importantly, in DSS-induced IBD in mice, Akt2 inhibition strongly ameliorates disease with animals presenting healthy-like crypts, having tightened colon epithelial cells expressing TJP, and presenting an anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage phenotype. In contrast, treatment with Akt1 inhibitors enhances histological damage, TJP disorganization reduces Lgr5+ expression and promotes a more proinflammatory milieu further favoring the development of the disease. Those results suggest that a balance between Akt1 and Akt2 regulates the functionality of the intestinal epithelial barrier, cell renewal and inflammation and that Akt2 inhibition can be considered as a new therapy for IBD.\n\nTHE PAPER EXPLAINEDInflammatory bowel disease (IBD), that includes Croh[n]s disease and ulcerative colitis, needs better therapeutic options. Importantly, IBD is a risk factor for the development of colorectal cancer. IBD is associated with epithelial barrier dysfunction, decreasing its permeability, and finally leading to chronic inflammation and disease. We show that the Akt1 and Akt2 protein kinase isoforms play different and opposite roles in the integrity of intestinal epithelial barrier by affecting the expression and/or the intracellular localization of tight junction proteins (TJP) responsible for barrier formation and reducing anti-barrier ones when Akt1 is overexpressed or Akt2 is inhibited. Those results were confirmed in ex vivo organoids, a system that mimics intestinal tissue organization, where Akt1 inhibition resulted in dissembled and disorganized structures that resembled those found in IBD patients. There is a balance between Akt1 and Akt2 activation on the epithelial cells, and when Akt1 is less abundant than Akt2, the barrier is disrupted by the dysregulation of the tightness of the barrier by the TJPs, leading also to an acute phase of inflammation. Epithelial cells are also incapable of renewing themselves by the absence of active Akt1, making the damage more severe, creating a pro-inflammatory niche that derives on chronic inflammation and severe IBD. Interestingly, those in vitro and ex vivo results can be translated to the whole animals. IBD disease and colon inflammation and histological alterations induced in mice by an irritant DSS could be either worsened with an Akt1 inhibitor or much improved with treatment with an Akt2 inhibitor, respectively. The inhibition of Akt2 may be considered as a treatment or co-treatment of IBD by regulating this balance to an Akt1 predominance environment. Thus, the use of Akt2 inhibitors, already developed, could be an alternative way to treat this disease.",

However, microorganisms can also survive lethal drug exposure by entering into temporary quiescence, a phenomenon called drug tolerance (DT), which is rather unexplored in Leishmania.\n\nMethodsWe studied a panel of 9 Leishmania braziliensis strains highly susceptible to potassium antimonyl tartrate (PAT), exposed promastigotes to lethal PAT pressure and compared several cellular and molecular parameters distinguishing DT from DR.\n\nResults and discussionWe demonstrated in vitro that a variable proportion of cells remained viable, showing all the criteria of DT and not of DR: (i) signatures of quiescence, under drug pressure: reduced proliferation and significant decrease of rDNA transcription, (ii) reversibility of the phenotype: return to low IC50 after removal of drug pressure, (iii) absence of significant genetic differences between exposed and unexposed lineages of each strain and absence of reported markers of DR. We found different levels of quiescence and DT among the different L. braziliensis strains. We provide here a new in vitro model of drug-induced quiescence and DT in Leishmania. Research should be extended in vivo, but current model could be further exploited to support R&D, for instance, to guide screening of compounds able to overcome quiescence resilience of the parasite, hereby improving therapy of leishmaniasis.",

    "abstract": "The Protein Phosphatase type 1 catalytic subunit (PP1c) (PF3D7_1414400) operates in combination with various regulatory proteins to specifically direct and control its phosphatase activity. However, little is known about this phosphatase and its regulators in the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into structural and functional characteristics of a conserved Plasmodium-specific regulator called Gametocyte EXported Protein 15, GEXP15 (PF3D7_1031600). Through in silico analysis, we identified three significant regions of interest in GEXP15: an N-terminal region housing a PP1-interacting RVxF motif, a conserved domain whose function is unknown and a GYF-like motif that potentially facilitates specific protein-protein interactions. To further elucidate the role of GEXP15, we conducted in vitro interaction studies, which demonstrated a direct interaction between GEXP15 and PP1 via the RVxF binding motif. This interaction was found to enhance phosphatase activity of PP1. Additionally, utilizing a transgenic GEXP15-tagged line and live microscopy, we observed high expression of GEXP15 in late asexual stages of the parasite, with localization predominantly in the parasite nucleus. Immunoprecipitation assays followed by mass spectrometry analyses revealed GEXP15s interaction with ribosomal and RNA binding proteins. Furthermore, through pulldown analyses of recombinant functional domains of GEXP15 tagged with a His-tag, we confirmed its binding to the ribosomal complex via the GYF domain. Collectively, our study sheds light on the PfGEXP15-PP1-ribosome interaction, which plays a crucial role in protein translation. These findings suggest that PfGEXP15 could serve as a potential target for the development of malaria drugs.",

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent, non-apoptotic form of cell death initiated by oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Recent evidence has linked ferroptosis to the action of the transcription factor Nuclear factor erythroid-2 derived,-like-1 (NFE2L1). NFE2L1 regulates proteasome abundance in an adaptive fashion, maintaining protein quality control to secure cellular homeostasis, but the regulation of NFE2L1 during ferroptosis and the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) herein are still unclear. In the present study, using an unbiased proteomic approach charting the specific ubiquitylation sites, we show that induction of ferroptosis leads to recalibration of the UPS. RSL3-induced ferroptosis inhibits proteasome activity and leads to global hyperubiquitylation, which is linked to NFE2L1 activation. As NFE2L1 resides in the endoplasmic reticulum tethered to the membrane, it undergoes complex posttranslational modification steps to become active and induce the expression of proteasome subunit genes. We show that proteolytic cleavage of NFE2L1 by the aspartyl protease DNA-damage inducible 1 homolog 2 (DDI2) is a critical step for the ferroptosis-induced feed-back loop of proteasome function. Cells lacking DDI2 cannot activate NFE2L1 in response to RSL3 and show global hyperubiquitylation. Genetic or chemical induction of ferroptosis in cells with a disrupted DDI2-NFE2L1 pathway diminishes proteasomal activity and promotes cell death. Also, treating cells with the clinical drug nelfinavir, which inhibits DDI2, sensitized cells to ferroptosis. In conclusion, our results provide new insight into the importance of the UPS in ferroptosis and highlight the role of the DDI2-NFE2L1 as a potential therapeutic target. Manipulating DDI2-NFE2L1 activity through chemical inhibition might help sensitizing cells to ferroptosis, thus enhancing existing cancer therapies.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=141 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/547652v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b3f899org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18625feorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@287bcborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d758d1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The remarkable regenerative abilities observed in planarians and cnidarians are closely linked to the active proliferation of adult stem cells and the precise differentiation of their progeny, both of which typically deteriorate during aging in low regenerative animals. While regeneration-specific genes conserved in highly regenerative organisms may confer regenerative abilities and long-term maintenance of tissue homeostasis, it remains unclear whether introducing these regenerative genes into low regenerative animals can improve their regeneration and aging processes. Here we ectopically express high regenerative species-specific JmjC domain-encoding genes (HRJDs) in Drosophila, a widely used low regenerative model organism. Surprisingly, HRJD expression impedes tissue regeneration in the developing wing disc but extends organismal lifespan when expressed in the intestinal stem cell lineages of the adult midgut under non-regenerative conditions. Notably, HRJDs enhance the proliferative activity of intestinal stem cells while maintaining their differentiation fidelity, ameliorating age-related decline in gut barrier functions. These findings together suggest that the introduction of highly regenerative species-specific genes can improve stem cell functions and promote a healthy lifespan when expressed in aging animals.",

    "abstract": "O_LIModern Coexistence Theory (MCT) offers a conceptually straightforward approach for connecting empirical observations with an elegant theoretical framework, gaining popularity rapidly over the past decade. However, beneath this surface-level simplicity lie various assumptions and subjective choices made during data analysis. These can lead researchers to draw qualitatively different conclusions from the same set of experiments. As the predictions of MCT studies are often treated as outcomes, and many readers and reviewers may not be familiar with the frameworks assumptions, there is a particular risk of \"researcher degrees of freedom\" inflating the confidence in results, thereby affecting reproducibility and predictive power.\nC_LIO_LITo tackle these concerns, we introduce a checklist consisting of statistical best-practices to promote more robust empirical applications of MCT. Our recommendations are organised into four categories: presentation and sharing of raw data, testing model assumptions and fits, managing uncertainty associated with model coefficients, and incorporating this uncertainty into coexistence predictions.\nC_LIO_LIWe surveyed empirical MCT studies published over the past 15 years and discovered a high degree of variation in the level of statistical rigour and adherence to best practices. We present case studies to illustrate the dependence of results on seemingly innocuous choices among competition model structure and error distributions, which in some cases reversed the predicted coexistence outcomes. These results demonstrate how different analytical approaches can profoundly alter the interpretation of experimental results, underscoring the importance of carefully considering and thoroughly justifying each step taken in the analysis pathway.\nC_LIO_LIOur checklist serves as a resource for authors and reviewers alike, providing guidance to strengthen the empirical foundation of empirical coexistence analyses. As the field of empirical MCT shifts from a descriptive, trailblazing phase to a stage of consolidation, we emphasise the need for caution when building upon the findings of earlier studies. To ensure that progress made in the field of ecological coexistence is based on robust and reliable evidence, it is crucial to subject our predictions, conclusions, and generalizability to a more rigorous assessment than is currently the trend.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "To limit transposable element (TE) mobilization, most eukaryotes have evolved small RNAs to silence TE activity via homology-dependent mechanisms. Small RNAs, 20-30 nucleotides in length, bind to PIWI proteins and guide them to nascent transcripts by sequence complementarity, triggering the recruitment of histone methyltransferase enzymes on chromatin to repress the transcriptional activity of TEs and other repeats. In the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia, 25-nt scnRNAs corresponding to TEs recruit Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), and trigger their elimination during the formation of the somatic nucleus. Here, we sequenced sRNAs during the entire sexual cycle with unprecedented precision. Our data confirmed that scnRNAs are produced from the entire germline genome, from TEs and non-TE sequences, during meiosis. Non-TE scnRNAs are selectively degraded, which results in the specific selection of TE-scnRNAs. We provide important mechanistic insight into the scnRNA selection pathway by identifying PRC2 and its cofactors as essential for the selective degradation of non-TE-scnRNAs. Our findings reveal a new mechanism for PRC2 that involves a non-methyltransferase function for regulating small RNA dynamics during development.",

    "abstract": "Iron is a vital element for life. However, after the Great Oxidation Event, the bioavailability of this element became limited. To overcome iron shortage and to scavenge this essential nutrient, microorganisms use siderophores, secondary metabolites that have some of the highest affinities for ferric iron. The crucial step of iron release from these compounds to be subsequently integrated into cellular components is mediated by Siderophore-Interacting Proteins (SIPs) or Ferric-siderophore reductases (FSRs).\n\nIn this work, we report the structure of an FSR for the first time. FhuF from laboratory strain Escherichia coli K-12 is the archetypical FSR, known for its atypical 2Fe-2S cluster with the binding motif C-C-X10-C-X2-C. The 1.9 [A] resolution crystallographic structure of FhuF shows it to be the only 2Fe-2S protein known to date with two consecutive cysteines binding different Fe atoms. This novel coordination provides a rationale for the unusual spectroscopic properties of FhuF. Furthermore, FhuF shows an impressive ability to reduce hydroxamate-type siderophores at very high rates when compared to flavin-based SIPs, but like SIPs it appears to use the redox-Bohr effect to achieve catalytic efficiency.\n\nOverall, this work closes the knowledge gap regarding the structural properties of ferric-siderophore reductases and simultaneously opens the door for further understanding of the diverse mechanistic abilities of these proteins in the siderophore recycling pathway.",

    "abstract": "The spatial organization of ribosomes in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria has been a subject of longstanding intrigue. Previous investigations suggested that ribosomes remain completely excluded from the chromosome-rich nucleoid region in a \"poor solvent\" like cytoplasm. Here, we present an integrated model of the bacterial cytoplasm, informed by experimental data, which updates this prevailing narrative. We demonstrate that ribosomes maintain a delicate balance of both attractive and repulsive interactions with the chromosome, contrary to the conventional notion of it acting as an inert crowder in cytoplasm. The multi-dimensional spatial distribution of free ribosomes (30S and 50S) and bound ribosomes (70S polysome) inside the cytoplasm reveals that the extent of mutual ribosome-chromosome segregation is relatively less pronounced due to the presence of non-negligible amount of ribosomes within the inner core of the cytoplasm. In particular, we identify a central void within the inner-most core of the nucleoid that lacks chromosomal DNA but can accommodate finite proportion of both free (11 %) and bound (18 %) ribosomes. Furthermore, our analysis of the chromosome mesh size and the conformation of bound ribosomes suggests that bound ribosomes remain elongated and would be able to navigate past the chromosome mesh to access the central void. Together by highlighting the dynamic nature of ribosome localization in E. coli, this investigation proposes that this segregation is crucial for maximizing the utilization of synthesized mRNA and facilitating efficient translation into proteins, which are essential for bacterial survival.",

Phytosulfokine (PSK) mediates plant growth and attenuates activation of plant pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). We show that the small cysteine-containing effector VdSCP8 from Verticillium dahliae (Vd) is a virulence-promoting protein that suppresses PTI in Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. Apoplastic SCP8 suppresses immune activation through leucine-rich repeat ectodomain pattern recognition receptors. SCP8 virulence and immunosuppressive activities require PHYTOSULFOKINE RECEPTOR 1 (PSKR1), which binds PSK and forms a complex with co-receptor BAK1 for PTI suppression. We find that PSK, like SCP8, suppresses PTI, SCP8 stimulates PSKR1-BAK1 complex formation, and that Vd requires PSK signaling for host infection. SCP8 interacts with an apoplastic subtilase, and co-expression of SCP8 and subtilase inhibitors reduces PTI suppression. Our findings suggest that a multi-host plant pathogen manipulates PTI by enhancing immunosuppressive PSK signaling, likely through plant subtilase activity.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD), particularly late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD), is a prevalent form of dementia that significantly affects patients cognitive and behavioral capacities and longevity. Although approximately 70 genetic risk factors linked with AD have been identified, their influence on patient longevity remains unclear. Further, recent studies have associated copy number variations (CNVs) with the longevity of healthy individuals and immune-related pathways in AD patients. This study aims to investigate the role of CNVs on the longevity of AD patients by integrating multi-omics data from the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort through causality network inference.\n\nOur comprehensive analysis led to the construction of a CNV-gene-age of death (AOD) causality network. We successfully identified three key CNVs (DEL5006, mCNV14192, and DUP42180) and seven AD-longevity causal genes (PLGRKT, TLR1, PLAU, CALB2, SYTL2, OTOF, and NT5DC1) impacting AD patient longevity, independent of disease severity. This outcome emphasizes the potential role of plasminogen activation and chemotaxis in longevity. We propose several hypotheses regarding the role of identified CNVs and the plasminogen system on patient longevity.\n\nHowever, experimental validation is required to further corroborate these findings and uncover precise mechanisms. Despite these limitations, our study offers promising insights into the genetic influence on AD patient longevity and contributes to paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "In several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimers disease (AD), tau, a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) enriched in the axon, becomes hyperphosphorylated, detaches from microtubules, redistributes to the somato-dendritic compartment and self-aggregates. The mechanisms leading to neuronal dysfunction and death by tau pathology remain to be fully elucidated. C. elegans has been successfully used by several groups including ours to identify mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration. We generated three strains, one overexpressing wild-type human tau (WT Tau), one a tau mutant mimicking hyperphosphorylation (hyperP Tau) and one preventing phosphorylation (hypoP Tau) in GABA motor neurons. A significant reduction of body size and egg laying was noted in these tau strains. Starting at day 1, we found that the worms overexpressing hyperP Tau were smaller than the N2 control strain and the worms either overexpressing WT Tau or hypoP Tau. Starting at day 5, the worms overexpressing WT Tau were smaller than control and the worms overexpressing hypoP Tau. Egg laying was reduced in both hyperP Tau and WT Tau worms. Survival was only decreased in WT Tau worms. Motility deficits were also observed. For age-dependent paralysis, a difference was noted between control and hyperP Tau. Swimming activity and speed were increased in hypoP Tau and decreased in hyperP Tau strains. Axonal integrity was altered in all tau strains. In the case of synaptic activity, at day 1, it was increased in the hypoP Tau strain and decreased in the hyperP Tau one. Collectively, our data revealed that overexpression of tau exerted neuronal and peripheral defects indicating that tau dysfunction could affect cell-cell communication.",

    "abstract": "The center-periphery visual field axis guides early visual system organization with enhanced resources devoted to central vision leading to reduced peripheral performance relative to that of central vision (i.e., behavioral eccentricity effect) for most visual functions. The center-periphery organization extends to high-order visual cortex where for example the well-studied face-sensitive fusiform face area (FFA) shows sensitivity to central vision and place-sensitive parahippocampal place area (PPA) shows sensitivity to peripheral vision. As we have recently found that face perception is more sensitive to eccentricity than place perception, here we examined whether these behavioral findings reflect differences in FFA and PPAs sensitivities to eccentricity. We assumed FFA would show higher sensitivity to eccentricity than PPA would, but that both regions modulation by eccentricity would be invariant to the viewed category. We parametrically investigated (fMRI, n=32) how FFAs and PPAs activations are modulated by eccentricity ([&le;]8{degrees}) and category (upright/inverted faces/houses) while keeping stimulus size constant. As expected, FFA showed an overall higher sensitivity to eccentricity than PPA. However, both regions activation modulations by eccentricity were dependent on the viewed category. In FFA a reduction of activation with growing eccentricity (\"BOLD eccentricity effect\") was found (with different amplitudes) for all categories. In PPA however, there were qualitative modulations of the BOLD eccentricity effect with mild BOLD eccentricity effect for houses but a reverse BOLD eccentricity effect for faces and no modulation for inverted faces. Our results emphasize that peripheral vision investigations are critical to further our understanding of visual processing both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n\nSignificance statementVisual perception significantly deteriorates with growing distance from central vision (behavioral eccentricity effect) with varying degrees according to visual function. For some functions (but not others) deterioration follows the reduction of resources devoted to peripheral vision at early visual processing stages. While early stages of visual processing reflect retinal spatial arrangement, here we found that activations in high-order visual areas that are less sensitive to visual field location show a BOLD fMRI activation eccentricity effect that mirrors the behavioral eccentricity effect. Importantly, the BOLD eccentricity effects we found varied across regions and were modulated quantitatively and qualitatively by the viewed visual categories. Our results emphasize that peripheral vision investigations are critical to further our understanding of visual processing.",

The isolates were identified based on the sequences of the D1/D2 domain of the 26S rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS-5.8S) region. Genetic differences were found between pulque and henequen mezcal isolates and within henequen mezcal isolates, as shown by different branching patterns in the ITS-5.8S phylogenetic tree and (GTG)5 microsatellite profiles, suggesting that sub-strate and process selective conditions may originate different K. marxianus populations. All the isolates fermented and assimilated inulin and lactose and some henequen isolates could also assimilate xylose and cellobiose. Henequen isolates were more thermotolerant than pulque isolates which in contrast presented more tolerance to the cell wall-disturbing agent calcofluor white (CFW) suggesting that they had a different cell wall structure. Additionally, depending on their origin, the isolates presented different maximum specific growth rates ({micro}max) patterns at different temperatures. Concerning tolerance to stress factors relevant for lignocellulosic hydrolysates fermentation, tolerance limits were lower at 42 than 30{degrees}C except for glucose and furfural. Pulque isolates were less tolerant to ethanol, NaCl, and Cd. Finally, all the isolates could produce ethanol by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of a corncob hydrolysate under laboratory conditions at 42{degrees}C.",

The membrane-bound protein was isolated from Desulfitobacterium hafniense strain TCE1 as a PceA2B2 complex catalysing the dechlorination of tetrachloroethene (PCE). Two catalytic PceA subunits are anchored to the membrane by two small integral membrane PceB subunits. The structure reveals two menaquinone molecules bound at the interface of the two different subunits, which are the starting point of a chain of redox cofactors for electron transfer to the active site.

    "abstract": "RationalePulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive and lethal disease that leads to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular failure. The phenotypic switching of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) plays a crucial role in the pathological progression of PAH. However, the underlying mechanism of SMC phenotypic modulation remains unclear.\n\nObjectivesWe aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of SMC phenotypes and regulatory networks by analyzing hypertensive and non-diseased pulmonary arteries.\n\nMethodsWe performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on pulmonary arteries obtained from patients with PAH and healthy donors. This was followed by bioinformatics analyses, mouse models, and in vitro studies to construct a normal pulmonary artery atlas, characterize SMC phenotypes, investigate intercellular communication, and explore the molecular mechanisms underlying SMC phenotypic switching.\n\nMeasurements and Main ResultsOur scRNA-seq analysis identified specific activation of vascular cells, including myofibrocytes, macrophage M2 polarization, endothelial-mesenchymal transition, and chondroid-like SMCs in healthy pulmonary arteries. In PAH pathology, there was an enhanced phenotypic switch of SMCs from contractile to fibroblast-like. Intercellular communication revealed increased M1 macrophage-SMC crosstalk in PAH, which was facilitated by NAMPT. Using a cellular co-culture system, we found that NAMPT-mediated M1 macrophage polarization induced fibroblast-like phenotypic switching in SMCs via the CCR2/CCR5 axis.\n\nConclusionsOur findings provide a comprehensive cell atlas of healthy human pulmonary arteries and demonstrate that NAMPT-driven M1 macrophage polarization plays a critical role in the fibroblast-like phenotypic switching of SMCs through CCR2/CCR5 cellular crosstalk in PAH.",

    "abstract": "In many animals, germ cell segregation occurs during early embryogenesis to protect the genome, but its origin in basal metazoans is controversial. Here, we show in the freshwater polyp Hydra by clonal analysis and transgenic animals that interstitial stem cells comprise two separate stem cell populations, i.e., germline and multipotent somatic stem cells. We isolated genetically labelled stem cells for a global transcriptome study and discovered a broad set of germline-specific/enriched genes including Prdm9, Pax5, Dmrt1. In an alternative splicing analysis, we identified many genes with germline-specific isoforms; among them, male-specific isoforms of Dmrt1 and Snf5. The somatic interstitial stem cell lineage was characterized by numerous neuronal control genes like Neurog. But all stem cells in Hydra also share a core of stemness genes that has its roots in unicellular eukaryotes. This suggests an evolutionary scenario in which, at the emergence of animal multicellularity, there was an early split into a stable germline and different somatic stem cell lineages.",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal organization of transcription is essential for organism development. Most eukaryotic genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). In stem cells, Pol II forms prominent clusters, which gradually disappear during differentiation, such that only smaller clusters remain. Here, we ask whether the formation and loss of large Pol II clusters is a stereotypical process explicable by changes in the Pol II transcriptional state during differentiation. We assess clusters by super-resolution microscopy in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, sperm precursor formation in fruit flies, and germ layer induction in zebrafish. In all cases, Pol II clusters first become larger and rounder, then unfold, and finally disperse into small clusters. These shape changes are accompanied by initial increase in recruited Pol II, subsequent transition into transcript elongation, and finally reduction of active enhancers. We reproduce these observations using a biophysical surface condensation model, where enhancers support Pol II cluster formation, and transcriptional activity unfolds clusters. Our work indicates that changes in enhancer marks and transcriptional activity during differentiation define a stereotyped trajectory through a generally applicable space of cluster shapes.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=189 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/547621v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fb769borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@27f6a0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b0ab7corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ca932d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Affilin proteins (artificial binding proteins based on the ubiquitin scaffold) were generated using directed protein evolution to yield de-novo variants that bind the extra-domain B (EDB) of oncofetal fibronectin, an abundant tumor marker in fetal and neoplastic tissues. Structures of two EDB-specific Affilin molecules reveal striking structural plasticity of the ubiquitin scaffold, characterized by {beta}-strand slippage, leading to diverse register shifts of the {beta}5 strands. This recruits residues from {beta}5 to a loop region, enhancing the target-binding interface. The observed {beta}-strand rearrangements, manifested by pressure of selection for target binding, challenge the accepted paradigm that directed evolution of binding proteins should base on rigid frameworks. Fold plasticity allowing {beta}-strand slippages enhances the evolutionary potential of proteins beyond \"simple\" mutations significantly and provides a general mechanism to generate residue insertions/deletions in proteins. They are however difficult to predict, underlining the need for caution in interpretation of structure-activity relationships of evolved proteins.",

However, approximately 40% retain wild type CDH1 alleles, indicating that modulation of other genes attenuates the AJ during ILC etiology. To identify alternative drivers, we performed targeted sequencing in CDH1 wild type samples, based on a defined set of 100 AJ, tight junction, and desmosome genes we designated as the  Adhesome. In 146 ILC samples, we identified 62 cases (43%) with wild type CDH1 alleles in which we detected a total of 284 mutations in 36 Adhesome genes. After selection based on occurrence and potential loss of function, we identified an inactivating frameshift mutation in Afadin (AFDN; p.Lys630fs).\n\nFunctional studies in E-cadherin-expressing breast cancer cells showed that Afadin knockout leads to immature AJs, and a non-cohesive phenotype accompanied by actomyosin dependent anoikis resistance, which are classical ILC hallmarks. Afadin reconstitutions show that F-actin organization critically depends on the E-catenin binding CC domain. Afadin loss in intraductal xenograft mouse breast cancer models leads to ILC-type morphologies and overt lung metastases. AFDN truncate reconstitutions revealed that deletion of the C-terminal E-catenin binding CC domain is sufficient to drive metastatic ILC. In conclusion, we identified and functionally coupled a somatic frameshift AFDN mutation in breast cancer to destabilization the epithelial AJ and the development of ILC hallmarks such as actomyosin-dependent anoikis resistance and single cell invasion. As such, Afadin represents a candidate tumor suppressor for E-cadherin-positive ILC development and progression.",

    "abstract": "Chronic liver diseases are worldwide on the rise. Due to the rapidly increasing incidence, in particular in Western countries, Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is gaining importance as the disease can develop into hepatocellular carcinoma. Lipid accumulation in hepatocytes has been identified as the characteristic structural change in NAFLD development, but molecular mechanisms responsible for disease progression remained unresolved. Here, we uncover in primary hepatocytes from a preclinical model fed with a Western diet (WD) a strong downregulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway and an upregulation of the MAPK pathway. Dynamic pathway modeling of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signal transduction combined with global proteomics identifies that an elevated basal MET phosphorylation rate is the main driver of altered signaling leading to increased proliferation of WD-hepatocytes. Model-adaptation to patient-derived hepatocytes reveal patient-specific variability in basal MET phosphorylation, which correlates with patient outcome after liver surgery. Thus, dysregulated basal MET phosphorylation could be an indicator for the health status of the liver and thereby inform on the risk of a patient to suffer from liver failure after surgery.",

    "abstract": "Adult humans respond to heart injury by forming a permanent scar, yet other vertebrates are capable of robust and complete cardiac regeneration. Despite progress towards characterizing the mechanisms of cardiac regeneration in fish and amphibians, the large evolutionary gulf between mammals and regenerating vertebrates complicates deciphering which cellular and molecular features truly enable regeneration. To better define these features, we compared cardiac injury responses in zebrafish and medaka, two fish species that share similar heart anatomy and common teleost ancestry but differ in regenerative capability. We used single-cell transcriptional profiling to create a time-resolved comparative cell atlas of injury responses in all major cardiac cell types across both species. With this approach, we identified several key features that distinguish cardiac injury response in the non-regenerating medaka heart. By comparing immune responses to injury, we found altered cell recruitment and a distinct pro-inflammatory gene program in medaka leukocytes, and an absence of the injury-induced interferon response seen in zebrafish. In addition, we found a lack of pro-regenerative signals, including nrg1 and retinoic acid, from medaka endothelial and epicardial cells. Finally, we identified alterations in the myocardial structure in medaka, where they lack embryonic-like primordial layer cardiomyocytes, and fail to employ a cardioprotective gene program shared by regenerating vertebrates. Our findings reveal notable variation in injury response across nearly all major cardiac cell types in zebrafish and medaka, demonstrating how evolutionary divergence influences the hidden cellular features underpinning regenerative potential in these seemingly similar vertebrates.",

It forms an N-terminal {beta}-cap that binds to DNA, and a MEILB2 coiled-coil that bridges to C-terminal ARM domains. Upon BRCA2-binding, MEILB2-BRME1 2:2 complexes dimerize into a V-shaped 2:4:4 complex, with rod-like MEILB2-BRME1 components arranged at right-angles. The {beta}-caps located at the tips of the MEILB2-BRME1 limbs are separated by 25 nm, allowing them to bridge between DNA molecules. Thus, we propose that BRCA2 induces MEILB2-BRME1 to function as a DNA clamp, connecting resected DNA ends or homologous chromosomes to facilitate meiotic recombination.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a popular method used to investigate brain function. Stimulation over the motor cortex evokes muscle contractions known as motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and also high frequency volleys of electrical activity measured in the cervical spinal cord. The physiological mechanisms of these experimentally derived responses remain unclear, but it is thought that the connections between circuits of excitatory and inhibitory neurons play a vital role. Using a spiking neural network model of the motor cortex, we explained the generation of waves of activity, so called  I-waves, following cortical stimulation. The model reproduces a number of experimentally known responses including direction of TMS, increased inhibition and changes in strength. Using populations of thousands of neurons in a model of cortical circuitry we showed that the cortex generated transient oscillatory responses without any tuning, and that neuron parameters such as refractory period and delays influenced the pattern and timing of those oscillations. By comparing our network with simpler, previously proposed circuits, we explored the contributions of specific connections and found that recurrent inhibitory connections are vital in producing later waves which significantly impact the production of motor evoked potentials in downstream muscles (Thickbroom, 2011). This model builds on previous work to increase our understanding of how complex circuitry of the cortex is involved in the generation of I-waves.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the critical cell-types impacted by various diseases is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and developing targeted therapeutics. Recent advances in disease genetic module discovery and single-cell technologies provide a unique opportunity to study critical cell-types based on functional pathways and modules. Disease genetic modules are defined as sets of genes with correlated expression that are part of the same biological pathways and are disrupted in the disease. Critical cell-types for a biological function are defined as clusters of similar cells most \"active\" or \"involved\" in that biological function. In this paper, we provide a formal problem definition for the critical cell discovery problem using the recently introduced local correlation concept, and show that the proposed problem is intractable in theory. We propose a novel method, MoToCC (Module To Critical Cell-types), to find sets of similar cells with local correlated gene expression activity for input modules. We evaluated MoToCC on four neurodevelopmental disorder modules using single-cell expression data from the developing human cortex. Finally, we demonstrate that the objective value returned by MoToCC for the tested modules is an acceptable approximation to the optimal solution. Overall, our work provides a valuable tool for studying critical cell-types and their role in disease mechanisms, which could lead to the development of more effective targeted therapeutics.

A simple model is developed that quantitatively captures the observed relationship between Z and B, based on a Gaussian electron density distribution with a constant electron density at the position of the scatterer. From this analysis, the fractional changes in B and Z are found to be similar. The utility of B-factor refinement to potentially distinguish atom types reflects the Z dependence of X-ray atomic scattering factors; the weaker dependence of electron atomic scattering factors on Z implies that distinctions between refined values of B in an electron scattering structure will be less sensitive to the atomic identity of a scatterer than for the case with X-ray-diffraction. This behavior provides an example of the complementary information that can be extracted from different types of scattering studies.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically-disordered regions (IDRs) promote intracellular phase separation and the formation of biomolecular condensates through interactions encoded in their primary sequence. While these condensates form spatially distinct assemblies in cells, it is unclear whether such specificity can be conferred by IDRs alone. Indeed, IDRs exhibit high conformational flexibility whereas specificity in protein recognition is generally associated with well-defined 3D structures. To characterize IDR-IDR interactions and assess their ability to mediate self-specific partitioning, we developed a synthetic system of Multivalent IDRs forming Constitutive DROPlets (micDROP). We investigated ten natural IDRs that underwent phase separation in micDROP. These IDRs exhibited a wide range of saturation concentrations in vivo, which correlated well with their total sequence stickiness. We then probed IDR-IDR specificity by co-expressing pairs of IDRs fused to homologous scaffolds that did not co-assemble. We observed a high degree of promiscuity, particularly among IDRs from the proteins Ddx4, DYRK3, ER, FUS, hnRNPA1, HspB8, RBM14 and TAF15, whereas TDP43 and UBQ2 formed spatially distinct condensates regardless of their partner. Further investigation revealed the short and conserved -helical segment of TDP43s IDR was governing its specific self-recognition. Our findings imply that IDRs can tune their phase separation propensity through sequence composition, while their formation of discrete condensates likely requires additional cellular or structural determinants.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/547715v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (60K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bc6a1forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@db4325org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1154717org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ee619e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Neurosteroids have been implicated in the pathophysiology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Allopregnanolone is reduced in subsets of individuals with PTSD and has been explored as a novel treatment strategy. Both direct trauma exposure and witnessed trauma are risk factors for PTSD; however, the role of neurosteroids in the behavioral outcomes of these unique experiences has not been explored. Here we investigate whether observational fear is associated with a reduced capacity for endogenous neurosteroidogenesis and the relationship with behavioral outcomes. We demonstrate that both mice directly subjected to the threat (foot shocks) and those witnessing the threat have decreased plasma levels of allopregnanolone. The expression of a key enzyme involved in endogenous neurosteroid synthesis, 5-reductase type 2, is decreased in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), which is a major emotional processing hub implicated in PTSD. We demonstrate that knockdown of 5-reductase type 2 exaggerates the behavioral expression of fear in response to witnessed trauma, whereas treatment with an exogenous, synthetic neuroactive steroid GABAA receptor PAM with molecular pharmacology similar to allopregnanolone (SGE-516 [tool compound]) decreases the behavioral response to observational fear. These data implicate impaired endogenous neurosteroidogenesis in the pathophysiology of threat exposure, both direct and witnessed. Further, these data suggest that treatment with exogenous 5-reduced neurosteroids or targeting endogenous neurosteroidogenesis may be beneficial for the treatment of individuals with PTSD, whether resulting from direct or witnessed trauma.",

Intranasal administration of house dust mite or fungal allergens induced tuft cell expansion, eosinophilia, sneezing, Type 2 responses, and neuropeptide release. Mice lacking tuft cells lost these responses but retained eosinophilia and elevated neuropeptides. Ablation of Transient Receptor Potential Channel Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)+ neurons prevented allergen-evoked tuft cell expansion and eosinophilia without affecting ILC2 and TH2 cell recruitment. Exposure of naive TG neurons to allergen evoked calcium influx and neuropeptide release, but only Substance P (SP) adaptively increased upon repetitive allergen exposure. SP instructed tuft cell lineage commitment and initiated allergic inflammation. Ablation or inhibition of the SP receptor, neurokinin 1, reversed allergen-induced sneezing, tuft cell expansion, and eosinophilia.

    "abstract": "Prenylation is a universal and irreversible post-translational modification that supports membrane interactions of proteins involved in various cellular processes, including migration, proliferation, and survival. Thus, dysregulation of prenylation contributes to multiple disorders, including cancers, vascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. During prenylation, prenyltransferase enzymes tether metabolically produced isoprenoid lipids to proteins via a thioether linkage. Pharmacological inhibition of the lipid synthesis pathway by statins has long been a therapeutic approach to control hyperlipidemia. Building on our previous finding that statins inhibit membrane association of G protein {gamma} (G{gamma}) in a subtype-dependent manner, we investigated the molecular reasoning for this differential. We examined the prenylation efficacy of carboxy terminus (Ct) mutated G{gamma} in cells exposed to Fluvastatin and prenyl transferase inhibitors and monitored the subcellular localization of fluorescently tagged G{gamma} subunits and their mutants using live-cell confocal imaging. Reversible optogenetic unmasking-masking of Ct residues was used to probe their contribution to the prenylation process and membrane interactions of the prenylated proteins. Our findings suggest that specific Ct residues regulate membrane interactions of the G{gamma} polypeptide statin sensitivity, and prenylation efficacy. Our results also show that a few hydrophobic and charged residues at the Ct are crucial determinants of a proteins prenylation ability, especially under suboptimal conditions. Given the cell and tissue-specific expression of different G{gamma} subtypes, our findings explain how and why statins differentially perturb heterotrimeric G protein signaling in specific cells and tissues. Our results may provide molecular reasoning for repurposing statins as Ras oncogene inhibitors and the failure of using prenyltransferase inhibitors in cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Persistence of unrepaired DNA damage in oocytes is detrimental and may cause genetic aberrations, miscarriage, and infertility. RPA, an ssDNA-binding complex, is essential for various DNA-related processes. Here we report that RPA plays a novel role in DNA damage repair during postnatal oocyte development after meiotic recombination. To investigate the role of RPA during oogenesis, we inactivated RPA1 (replication protein A1), the largest subunit of the heterotrimeric RPA complex, specifically in oocytes using two germline-specific Cre drivers (Ddx4-Cre and Zp3-Cre). We find that depletion of RPA1 leads to the disassembly of the RPA complex, as evidenced by the absence of RPA2 and RPA3 in RPA1-deficient oocytes. Strikingly, severe DNA damage occurs in RPA1-deficient GV-stage oocytes. Loss of RPA in oocytes triggered the canonical DNA damage response mechanisms and pathways, such as activation of ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, and p53. In addition, the RPA deficiency causes chromosome misalignment at metaphase I and metaphase II stages of oocytes, which is consistent with altered transcript levels of genes involved in cytoskeleton organization in RPA1-deficient oocytes. Absence of the RPA complex in oocytes severely impairs folliculogenesis and leads to a significant reduction in oocyte number and female infertility. Our results demonstrate that RPA plays an unexpected role in DNA damage repair during mammalian folliculogenesis.",

Beneficial mutations drive evolution, yet selection is also shaped by the frequency of small-effect deleterious mutations, whose combined effect can burden otherwise adaptive lineages and alter evolutionary trajectories and outcomes in clonally evolving organisms such as viruses, microbes, and tumors. The small effect sizes of these important mutations have made accurate measurements of their rates difficult. In microbes, assessing the effect of mutations on growth can be especially instructive, as this complex phenotype is closely linked to fitness in clonally evolving organisms. Here, we perform high-throughput time-lapse microscopy on cells from mutation-accumulation strains to precisely infer the distribution of mutational effects on growth rate in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that mutational effects on growth rate are overwhelmingly negative, highly skewed towards very small effect sizes, and frequent enough to suggest that deleterious hitchhikers may impose a significant burden on evolving lineages. By using lines that accumulated mutations in either wild-type or slippage repair-defective backgrounds, we further disentangle the effects of two common types of mutations, single-nucleotide substitutions and simple sequence repeat indels, and show that they have distinct effects on yeast growth rate. Although the average effect of a simple sequence repeat mutation is very small (~0.3%), many do alter growth rate, implying that this class of frequent mutations has an important evolutionary impact.",

To determine whether Saccharomyces species have diverged in their response to temperature we measured changes in gene expression in response to a 12{degrees}C increase or decrease in temperature for four Saccharomyces species and their six pairwise hybrids. To ensure coverage of subtelomeric gene families we sequenced, assembled and annotated a complete S. uvarum genome. All the strains exhibited a stronger response to heat than cold treatment. In response to heat, the cryophilic species showed a stronger response than the thermophilic species. The hybrids showed a mixture of parental stress responses depending on the time point. After the initial response, hybrids with a thermophilic parent were more similar to S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus, and the S. cerevisiae x S. paradoxus hybrid showed the weakest heat shock response. Within the hybrids a small subset of temperature responsive genes showed species specific responses but most were also hybrid specific. Our results show that divergence in the heat shock response is indicative of a strains thermal tolerance, suggesting that cellular factors that signal heat stress or resolve heat induced changes are relevant to thermal divergence in the Saccharomyces species.",

    "abstract": "Standard ChIP-seq and RNA-seq processing pipelines typically disregard sequencing reads whose origin is ambiguous (\"multimappers\"). This usual practice has potentially important consequences for the functional interpretation of the data: genomic elements belonging to clusters composed of highly similar members are left unexplored. In particular, disregarding multimappers leads to the systematic underrepresentation in epigenetic studies of recently active transposons, such as AluYa5 and L1HS. Furthermore, this common strategy also has implications for transcriptomic analysis: members of repetitive gene families, such the ones including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II genes, are systematically underquantified. Based on these findings, we strongly advocate for the implementation of multimapper-aware bioinformatic genomic analyses.",

    "abstract": "Cellular cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a key method to unravel the spatial and structural complexity of cells in their near-native state at unprecedented molecular resolution. To enable quantitative analysis of the complex shapes and morphologies of lipid membranes, the noisy three-dimensional (3D) volumes must be segmented. Despite recent advances, this task often requires considerable user intervention to curate the resulting seg-mentations. Here, we present ColabSeg, a Python-based tool for processing, visualizing, cleaning, and fitting membrane segmentations from cryo-ET data for downstream analysis. ColabSeg makes many well-established algorithms for point-cloud processing easily available to the broad community of structural biologists for applications in cryo-ET through its graphical user interface (GUI). We demonstrate the usefulness of the tool with a range of use cases and biological examples. Finally, for a large Mycoplasma pneumoniae dataset of 50 tomograms, we show how ColabSeg enables high-throughput membrane segmentation, which can be used as valuable training dataset for fully automated convolutional neural network (CNN)-based segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Microglia play diverse pathophysiological roles in Alzheimers disease (AD), with genetic susceptibility factors skewing microglial cell function to influence AD risk. CD33 is an immunomodulatory receptor associated with AD susceptibility through a single nucleotide polymorphism that modulates mRNA splicing, skewing protein expression from a long protein isoform (CD33M) to a short isoform (CD33m). Understanding how human CD33 isoforms differentially impact microglial cell function in vivo has been challenging due to functional divergence of CD33 between mice and humans. We address this challenge by studying transgenic mice expressing either of the human CD33 isoforms crossed with the 5XFAD mouse model of amyloidosis and find that human CD33 isoforms have opposing effects on the response of microglia to amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) deposition. Mice expressing CD33M have increased A{beta} levels, mo7re diffuse plaques, fewer disease-associated microglia, and more dystrophic neurites compared to control 5XFAD mice. Conversely, CD33m promotes plaque compaction and microglia-plaque contacts, and minimizes neuritic plaque pathology, highlighting an AD protective role for this isoform. Protective phenotypes driven by CD33m are detected at an earlier timepoint compared to the more aggressive pathology in CD33M mice that appears at a later timepoint, suggesting that CD33m has a more prominent impact on microglia cell function at earlier stages of disease progression. In addition to divergent roles in modulating phagocytosis, scRNAseq and proteomics analyses demonstrate that CD33m+ microglia upregulate nestin, an intermediate filament involved in cell migration, at plaque contact sites. Overall, our work provides new functional insights into how CD33, as a top genetic susceptibility factor for AD, modulates microglial cell function.",

    "abstract": "The ability to distinguish a threatening from non-threatening conspecific based on past experience is critical for adaptive social behaviors. Although recent progress has been made in identifying the neural circuits that contribute to different types of positive and negative social interactions, the neural mechanisms that enable the discrimination of individuals based on past aversive experiences remain unknown. Here, we developed a modified social fear conditioning paradigm that induced in both sexes robust behavioral discrimination of a conspecific associated with a footshock (CS+) from a non-reinforced interaction partner (CS-). Strikingly, chemogenetic or optogenetic silencing of hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons, which have been previously implicated in social novelty recognition memory, resulted in generalized avoidance fear behavior towards the equally familiar CS-and CS+. One-photon calcium imaging revealed that the accuracy with which CA2 representations discriminate the CS+ from the CS-animal was enhanced following social fear conditioning and strongly correlated with behavioral discrimination. Moreover the CA2 representations incorporated a generalized or abstract representation of social valence irrespective of conspecific identity and location. Thus, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that the same hippocampal CA2 subregion mediates social memories based on conspecific familiarity and social threat, through the incorporation of a representation of social valence into an initial representation of social identity.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum plays a critical role in sensorimotor learning, using error information to keep the sensorimotor system well-calibrated. Here we present a population-coding model of how the cerebellum compensates for motor errors. The model consists of a two-layer network, with one layer corresponding to the cerebellar cortex and the other to the deep cerebellar nuclei. Units within each layer are tuned to two features: the direction of the movement and the direction of the error. To evaluate the model, we conducted a series of behavioral experiments using a wide range of perturbation schedules. The model successfully accounts for interference from prior learning, the effects of error uncertainties, and learning in response to perturbations that vary across different time scales. Importantly, the model does not require any modulation of the parameters or context-dependent processes during adaptation. Our results provide a novel framework to understand how context and environmental uncertainty modulate learning.",

    "abstract": "A land pattern change represents a globally significant trend with implications for the environment, climate, and societal well-being. While various methods have been developed to predict land change, our understanding of the underlying change processes remains inadequate. To address this issue, we investigate the suitability of the 2D kinetic Ising model (IM), an idealized model from statistical mechanics, for simulating land change dynamics. We test the IM on a variety of diverse thematic contexts. Specifically, we investigate four sites characterized by distinct patterns, presumably driven by different physical processes. Each site is observed on eight occasions between 2001 and 2019. Given the observed pattern at times ti, i = 1, ..., 7, we find two parameters of the IM such that the model-evolved land pattern at ti+1 resembles the observed land pattern at that time. Our findings indicate that the IM produces approximate matches to the observed patterns in terms of layout, composition, texture, and patch size distributions. Notably, the IM simulations even achieve a high degree of cell-scale pattern accuracy in two of the sites. Nevertheless, the IM has certain limitations, including its inability to model linear features, account for the formation of new large patches, and handle pattern shifts.",
