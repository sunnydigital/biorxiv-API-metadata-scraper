    "abstract": "Dental caries is the most common chronic infectious diseases around the world and disproportionately affects the marginalized socioeconomic group. Streptococcus mutans, considered a primary etiological agent of caries, must depend on the coordinated physiological response to tolerate the oxidative stress generated by commensal species within dental plaque, which is a critical aspect of its pathogenicity. Here, we identified and characterized a novel TetR family regulator SMU_1361c, encoded by the TnSmu2 operon, which appears to be acquired by the bacteria via horizontal genes transfer. Surprisingly, smu_1361c functions as a transcriptional repressor to regulate gene expression outside its operon, involved in the oxidative stress response of S. mutans. The smu_1361c overexpression strain UA159/pDL278-1361c was more susceptible to oxidative stress and less competitive against hydrogen peroxide generated by commensal species Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus sanguinis. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that smu_1361c overexpression resulted in the significant downregulation of 22 genes mainly belonging to three gene clusters responsible for the oxidative stress response. The conversed DNA binding motif of SMU_1361c was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift and DNase I footprinting assay with purified SMU_1361c protein, therefore, smu_1361c is directly involved in gene transcription related to the oxidative stress response. Crucially, our finding provides a new understanding of how S. mutans deals with the oxidative stress that is required for pathogenesis and will facilitate the development of new and improved therapeutic approaches for dental caries.",

    "abstract": "All free-living microorganisms homeostatically maintain the fluidity of their membranes by adapting lipid composition to environmental temperatures. A quantitative description of how organisms maintain constant fluidity at all growth temperatures has not been achieved. By quantifying both enzymes and metabolic intermediates of the Escherichia coli fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis pathways, we discover how E. coli measures steady-state temperature and restores optimal membrane fluidity within a single generation after temperature shocks. The first element of the system is a temperature-sensitive metabolic valve that allocates flux between the saturated and unsaturated fatty acid synthesis pathways. The second element is a transcription-based negative feedback loop that counteracts the temperature-sensitive valve. The combination of these elements accelerates membrane adaptation by causing a transient overshoot in the synthesis of saturated or unsaturated fatty acids following temperature shocks. This overshoot strategy accelerates membrane adaptation, and is comparable to increasing the temperature of a water bath by adding water that is excessively hot rather than adding water at the desired temperature. These properties are captured in a quantitative model, which we further use to show how hard-wired parameters calibrate the system to generate membrane compositions that maintain constant fluidity across a wide range of temperatures. We hypothesize that core design features of the E. coli system will prove to be ubiquitous features of homeoviscous adaptation systems.",

    "abstract": "Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bpm) is the causative agent of melioidosis disease. Bpm is a facultative intracellular pathogen with a complex lifecycle inside host cells. Pathogenic success depends on a variety of virulence factors with one of the most critical being the type 6 secretion system (T6SS). Bpm uses the T6SS to move into neighboring cells, resulting in multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs) formation, a strategy used to disseminate from cell-to-cell. Our prior study using a dual RNA-seq analysis to dissect T6SS-mediated virulence on intestinal epithelial cells identified BicA as a factor upregulated in a T6SS mutant (1). BicA regulates both type 3 secretion system (T3SS) and T6SSs; however, the extent of its involvement during disease progression is unclear. To fully dissect the role of BicA during systemic infection, we used two macrophage cell lines paired with a pulmonary in vivo challenge murine model. We found that {Delta}bicA has a distinct intracellular replication defect in both immortalized and primary macrophages that begins as early as 1 h post-infection. This intracellular defect is linked with the lack of cell-to-cell dissemination and MNGC formation, as well as a defect on T3SS expression. The in vitro phenotype translated in vivo as {Delta}bicA was attenuated in a pulmonary model of infection; demonstrating a distinct macrophage activation profile and lack of pathological features present in the wild type. Overall, these results highlight the role of BicA in regulating intracellular virulence and demonstrate that specific regulation of secretion systems has a significant effect on host response and Bpm pathogenesis.\n\nImportanceMelioidosis is an understudied tropical disease that still results in [~]50% fatalities from those infected patients. It is caused by the Gram-negative bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bpm). Bpm is an intracellular pathogen that disseminates from the infected cell to target organs, causing disseminated disease. Regulation of secretion systems involved in entry and cell-to-cell spread is poorly understood. In this work, we characterize the role of BicA as a regulator of secretion systems during infection of macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Understanding how these virulence factors are controlled will help us determine their influence on the host cells and define the macrophage responses associated with bacterial clearance.",

    "abstract": "Fluconazole is the most commonly used antifungal today. A result of this has been the inevitable selection of fluconazole resistant organisms. This is an especially acute problem in the pathogenic yeast Candida glabrata. Elevated minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for fluconazole in C. glabrata are frequently associated with substitution mutations within the Zn2Cys6 zinc cluster-containing transcription factor-encoding gene PDR1. These mutant Pdr1 regulators drive constitutively high expression of target genes like CDR1 that encodes an ATP-binding cassette transporter thought to act as a drug efflux pump. Exposure of C. glabrata to fluconazole induced expression of both Pdr1 and CDR1, although little is known of the molecular basis underlying the upstream signals that trigger Pdr1 activation. Here, we show that the protein phosphatase calcineurin is required for fluconazole-dependent induction of Pdr1 transcriptional regulation. Calcineurin catalytic activity is required for normal Pdr1 regulation and a hyperactive form of this phosphatase can increase resistance to the echinocandin caspofungin but does not show a similar elevation for fluconazole resistance. Loss of calcineurin from strains expressing two different gain-of-function forms of Pdr1 also caused a decrease in CDR1 expression and fluconazole resistance, demonstrating that even these hyperactive Pdr1 regulatory mutants cannot bypass the requirement for calcineurin. Our data implicate calcineurin activity as a link tying azole and echinocandin resistance together via the control of transcription factor activity.\n\nImportanceWhile drug resistant microorganisms are a problem in treatment of all infectious disease, this is an especially acute problem with fungi due to the existence of only 3 classes of antifungal drugs, including the azole drug fluconazole. In the pathogenic yeast Candida glabrata, mutant forms of a transcription factor called Pdr1 are commonly associated with fluconazole resistance and poor clinical outcomes. Here we identify a protein phosphatase called calcineurin that is required for fluconazole-dependent induction of Pdr1 transcriptional activation and associated drug resistance. Gain-of-function mutant forms of Pdr1 still required the presence of calcineurin to confer normally elevated fluconazole resistance. Previous studies showed that calcineurin is required for resistance to the echinocandin class of antifungal drugs and our data demonstrate this protein phosphatase is also required for azole drug resistance. Calcineurin plays a central role in resistance to two of the three major classes of antifungal drugs in C. glabrata.",

    "abstract": "Biogenic methane in subsurface coal seam environments is produced by diverse consortia of microbes. Although this methane is useful for global energy security, it remains unclear which microbes can liberate carbon from the coal. Most of this carbon is relatively resistant to biodegradation, as it is contained within aromatic rings. Thus, to explore for coal-degrading taxa in the subsurface, this study used coal seam metagenomes to reconstruct important metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) using a key genomic marker for the anaerobic degradation of monoaromatic compounds as a guide: the benzoyl-CoA reductase gene (bcrABCD). Three taxa were identified with this genetic potential. The first was a novel taxon from the Krumholzibacteriota phylum, which this study is the first to describe. This Krumholzibacteriota sp. contained a full set of genes for benzoyl-CoA dearomatisation, in addition to other genes for anaerobic catabolism of monoaromatics. Analysis of Krumholzibacteriota MAGs from other environments revealed that this genetic potential may be common within this phylum, and thus they may be important organisms for the liberation of recalcitrant carbon on a global scale. Further, two taxa from the Deltaproteobacteria class were also implicated in monoaromatic degradation; two geographically unrelated Syntrophorhabdus aromaticivorans MAGs, and a Syntrophaceae sp. MAG. Each of these three taxa are potential rate-limiting organisms for subsurface coal-to-methane biodegradation. Their description here provides an understanding of their function within the coal seam microbiome, and will help inform future efforts in coal bed methane stimulation, anoxic bioremediation of organic pollutants, and assessments of anoxic carbon cycling and emissions.\n\nImportanceSubsurface coal seams are highly anoxic and oligotrophic environments, where the main source of carbon is \"locked away\" within aromatic rings. Despite these challenges, biogenic methane accumulates within many of these coal seams, which implies that the coal seam microbiome can \"unlock\" this carbon source in situ. For over two decades, researchers have been working to understand which organisms are responsible for these processes. This study provides the first descriptions of these organisms. Here, we report metagenomic insights into the liberation of carbon from aromatic molecules typically found within coal, the degradation pathways involved, and descriptions of the Krumholzibacteriota sp., Syntrophorhabdus aromaticivorans, and Syntrophaceae sp. that contain this genetic potential. Additionally, this is the first time that the Krumholzibacteriota phylum has been implicated in anaerobic dearomatisation of aromatic hydrocarbons. This potential is identified here in numerous taxa within the phylum from other subsurface environments, implicating Krumholzibacteriota in global-scale carbon-cycling processes.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella variicola is an emergent human pathogen causing diverse infections, including in the urinary tract. However, little is known about the evolution and maintenance of genetic diversity in this species, the molecular mechanisms and their population dynamics. Here, we characterized the emergence of a novel rdar-like morphotype which is contingent both on the genetic background and the environment. We show that mutations in either the nitrogen assimilation control gene (nac) or the type III fimbriae regulator, mrkH, suffice to generate rdar-like colonies. These morphotypes are primarily selected for the reduced inter-cellular aggregation as a result of loss-of-function yielding reduced fimbriae expression. Additionally, these clones also display increased growth rate and reduced biofilm formation. Direct competitions between rdar and wild type clone show that mutations in mrkH provide large fitness advantages. In artificial urine, the morphotype is under strong negative frequency-dependent selection and is able to socially exploit wild type strains. An exhaustive search for mrkH mutants in public databases revealed that ca 8% of natural isolates analysed had truncated MrkH proteins many of which were due to insertions of IS elements, including a reported clinical isolate with rdar morphology. These strains were all isolated from human, mostly from urine. The decreased aggregation of these mutants could have important clinical implications as such clones could better disperse within the host allowing colonisation of other body sites and leading to systemic infections.\n\nOne-sentence SummaryReport of the emergence of a novel non-aggregative colony morphology in K. variicola and the first example of social exploitation in the Klebsiella genus.",

    "abstract": "Quality control of translation is crucial for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. Obstacles in translation elongation induce ribosome collision, which is monitored by multiple sensor mechanisms. The E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNF598 recognizes collided ribosomes, triggering ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) to rescue stalled ribosomes and no-go decay (NGD) to degrade stall-prone mRNAs in eukaryotes. However, the role of RQC and NGD in maintaining the translational homeostasis of endogenous mRNAs has remained largely unclear. In this study, we investigated endogenous substrate mRNAs of NGD using the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) of zebrafish embryos as a model system. Combining RNA-Seq analysis of znf598 mutant embryos with disome profiling and reporter assays, we revealed that mRNAs encoding the C2H2-type zinc finger domain (C2H2-ZF) frequently cause ribosome collisions and induce NGD during the MZT. Furthermore, we showed that mRNAs encoding C2H2-ZF are degraded by ZNF598 in human cells. Our results suggest that NGD maintains the quality of the translatome during protein evolution and animal development by mitigating the risk of ribosome collision at the abundantly present C2H2-ZF mRNA sequences.",

We show that activation of proVWX in response to a hyperosmotic shock involves the destabilization of H-NS-mediated bridges anchored between the proVWX downstream and upstream regulatory elements (DRE and URE), and between the DRE and ygaY that lies immediately downstream of proVWX. The re-establishment of these bridges upon adaptation to hyperosmolarity represses the operon.

Here, we characterize five such mutations that occur within the ligand binding pockets of the regulatory phosphotyrosine-recognition domains of SHP2, using high-throughput biochemical screens, biophysical and biochemical measurements, molecular dynamics simulations, and cellular assays. While many of these mutations impact binding affinity, the T42A mutation is unique in that it also alters ligand binding specificity. As a result, the T42A mutant has biased sensitivity toward a subset of activating phosphoproteins.

    "abstract": "Tryptophan is an essential amino acid that is extensively characterized as a regulator of cellular function through its metabolism by indoleamine 2,3-deoxygenase (IDO) into the kynurenine pathway. However, despite decades of research on tryptophan metabolism, the metabolic regulatory roles of it and its metabolites are not well understood. To address this, we performed an activity metabolomics screen of tryptophan and most of its known metabolites in cell culture. We discovered that treatment of human colon cancer cells (HCT116) with 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), a metabolite of kynurenine, potently disrupted TCA cycle function. Citrate and aconitate levels were increased, while isocitrate and all downstream TCA metabolites were decreased, suggesting decreased aconitase function. We hypothesized that 3HK or one of its metabolites increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibited aconitase activity. Accordingly, we observed almost complete depletion of reduced glutathione and a decrease in total glutathione levels. We observed a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability after 48 hours of 3HK treatment. These data suggest that raising the intracellular levels of 3HK could be sufficient to induce ROS-mediated apoptosis. We modulated the intracellular levels of 3HK by combined induction of IDO and knockdown of kynureninase (KYNU) in HCT116 cells. Cell viability decreased significantly after 48 hours of KYNU knockdown compared to controls, which was accompanied by increased ROS production and Annexin V staining revealing apoptosis. Finally, we identify xanthommatin production from 3-HK as a candidate radical-producing, cytotoxic mechanism. Our work indicates that KYNU may be a target for disrupting tryptophan metabolism. Interestingly, many cancers exhibit overexpression of IDO, providing a cancer-specific metabolic vulnerability that could be exploited by KYNU inhibition.",

    "abstract": "The post-translational regulation of protein function is involved in most cellular processes. As such, synthetic biology tools that operate at this level provide opportunities for manipulating cellular states. Here, we deploy a proximity-triggered protein trans-splicing technology to enable the time-resolved synthesis of target proteins from pre-made parts. The modularity of the strategy allows for the addition or removal of various control elements as a function of the splicing reaction, in the process permitting the cellular location and/or activity state of starting materials and products to be differentiated. The approach is applied to a diverse set of proteins, including the kinase oncofusions BCR/ABL and DNAJB1/PRKACA where dynamic cellular phosphorylation events are dissected, revealing distinct phases of signaling and identifying molecular players connecting the oncofusion to cancer transformation as novel therapeutic targets of cancer cells. We envision that the tools and control strategies developed herein will allow the activity of both naturally occurring and designer proteins to be harnessed for basic and applied research.",

In bacteria, dozens of genes are coordinated at specific times in the cell lifecycle to generate each component of the flagellum. This is the case for Caulobacter crescentus, but little is known about why this species encodes six different flagellin genes. Furthermore, little is known about the benefits multi-flagellin species possess over single flagellin species, if any, or what molecular properties allow for multi-flagellin filaments to assemble. Here we present an in-depth analysis of several single flagellin filaments from C. crescentus, including an extremely well-resolved structure of a bacterial flagellar filament. We highlight key molecular interactions that differ between each bacterial strain and speculate how these interactions may alleviate or impose helical strain on the overall architecture of the filament. We detail conserved residues within the flagellin subunit that allow for the synthesis of multi-flagellin filaments. We further comment on how these molecular differences impact bacterial motility and highlight how no single flagellin filament achieves wild-type levels of motility, suggesting C. crescentus has evolved to produce a filament optimized for motility comprised of six flagellins. Finally, we highlight an ordered arrangement of glycosylation sites on the surface of the filaments and speculate how these sites may protect the {beta}-hairpin located on the surface exposed domain of the flagellin subunit.",

LS is a multi-system disease characterized by severe neurologic and metabolic abnormalities. The defining feature of the disease is the presence of symmetric, bilateral, progressive necrotizing lesions in the brain stem, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying disease initiation and progression in LS have yet to be elucidated. Recent evidence demonstrates that the immune system plays a key role in LS pathogenesis. Treatment with the macrophage-depleting Csf1r inhibitor pexidartinib prevents disease in the Ndufs4(-/-) mouse model of LS, but the mechanisms leading to immune activation and governing disease progression remain to be elucidated. In recent work, the cytokines IFN{gamma} and IFN{gamma}-induced protein 10 (IP10) were found to be significantly elevated in Ndufs4(-/-) brainstem. Given their role as macrophage-activating factors, here we sought to assess the role of IFN{gamma} and IP10 in LS using by generating Ndufs4(-/-)/Ifng(-/-) and Ndufs4(-/-)/IP10(-/-) double knockout lines. We find that IP10 alone does not significantly impact the onset or progression of disease in the Ndufs4(-/-) model, while IFN{gamma} loss significantly, but modestly, improves survival. These data indicate that IFN{gamma} contributes to pathology, but that IFN{gamma} and IP10 are both dispensable for overall disease course of LS. Our findings support some role for IFN{gamma} targeting therapies in the management of mitochondrial disease, but suggest they may provide only modest benefits, at least in LS.",

    "abstract": "Inflammasome-mediated caspase-1 activation facilitates innate immune control of Plasmodium in the liver, thereby limiting the incidence and severity of clinical malaria. However, caspase-1 processing occurs incompletely in the hepatocytes and precludes the generation of mature IL-1{beta} or IL-18, unlike in other cells. Why this is so, or how it impacts Plasmodium control in the liver has remained unknown. We show that an inherently reduced expression of the inflammasome adaptor molecule ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD) is responsible for the incomplete proteolytic processing of caspase-1 in hepatocytes. Transgenically enhancing ASC expression in hepatocytes enabled complete caspase-1 processing, enhanced pyroptotic cell-death, maturation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1{beta} and IL-18 that was otherwise absent, and resulted in better overall control of Plasmodium infection in the liver mice. This however impeded the protection offered by live-attenuated anti-malarial vaccination. Tempering ASC expression in macrophages on the other hand resulted in incomplete processing of caspase-1. Our work shows how caspase-1 activation and function in host cells are fundamentally defined by ASC expression and offers a potential new pathway to create better disease and vaccination outcomes by modifying the latter.",

    "abstract": "The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is widely used as a host cell for recombinant protein production due to its fast growth, cost-effective culturing, and ability to secrete large and complex proteins. However, one major drawback is the relatively low yield of produced proteins compared to other host systems. To address this issue, we developed an overlay assay to screen the yeast knockout collection and identify mutants that enhance recombinant protein production, specifically focusing on the secretion of the Trametes trogii fungal laccase enzyme. Gene ontology analysis of these mutants revealed an enrichment of processes including vacuolar targeting, vesicle trafficking, proteolysis, and glycolipid metabolism. We confirmed that a significant portion of these mutants also showed increased activity of the secreted laccase when grown in liquid culture. Notably, we found that the combination of deletions of OCA6, a tyrosine phosphatase, along with PMT1 or PMT2, two ER membrane protein-O-mannosyltransferases involved in ER quality control, and SKI3, a component of the SKI complex responsible for mRNA degradation, further increased secreted laccase activity. Conversely, we also identified over 200 gene deletions that resulted in decreased secreted laccase activity, including many genes that encode for mitochondrial proteins and components of the ER-associated degradation pathway. Intriguingly, the deletion of the ER DNAJ co-chaperone SCJ1 led to almost no secreted laccase activity. When we expressed SCJ1 from a low-copy plasmid, laccase secretion was restored. However, overexpression of Scj1p had a detrimental effect, indicating that precise dosing of key chaperone proteins is crucial for optimal recombinant protein expression.\n\nImportanceOur study showcases a newly developed high throughput screening technique to identify yeast mutant strains that exhibit an enhanced capacity for recombinant protein production. Using a genome-wide approach, we show that vesicle trafficking plays a crucial role in protein production, as the genes associated with this process are notably enriched in our screen. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a specific set of gene deletions, which were not previously recognized for their impact on recombinant laccase production, can be effectively manipulated in combination to increase the production of heterologous proteins. This study offers potential strategies for enhancing the overall yield of recombinant proteins and provides new avenues for further research in optimizing protein production systems.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomes are complex macromolecules assembled from 4 rRNAs and 79 ribosomal proteins (RPs). Their assembly is organized in a highly hierarchical manner, which is thought to avoid dead-end pathways, thereby enabling efficient assembly of ribosomes in the large quantities needed for healthy cellular growth. Moreover, hierarchical assembly also can help ensure that each RP is included in the mature ribosome. Nonetheless, how this hierarchy is achieved remains unknown, beyond the examples that depend on direct RP-RP interactions, which account for only a fraction of the observed dependencies. Using assembly of the small subunit head and a disease-associated mutation in the assembly factor Ltv1 as a model system, we dissect here how the hierarchy in RP binding is constructed. Our data demonstrate that the LIPHAK-disease-associated Ltv1 mutation leads to global defects in head assembly, which are explained by direct binding of Ltv1 to 5 out of 15 RPs, and indirect effects that affect 4 additional RPs. These indirect effects are mediated by conformational transitions in the nascent subunit that are regulated by Ltv1. Mechanistically, Ltv1 aids the recruitment of some RPs via direct protein-protein interactions, but surprisingly also delays the recruitment of other RPs. Delayed binding of key RPs also delays the acquisition of RNA structure that is stabilized by these proteins. Finally, our data also indicate direct roles for Ltv1 in chaperoning the folding of a key rRNA structural element, the three-helix junction j34-35-38. Thus, Ltv1 plays critical roles in organizing the order of both RP binding to rRNA and rRNA folding, thereby enabling efficient 40S subunit assembly.",

Here, we determined that abortive TC-NER of trabectedin-DNA adducts forms persistent single-strand breaks (SSBs) as the adducts block the second of the two sequential NER incisions. We mapped the 3-hydroxyl groups of SSBs originating from the first NER incision at trabectedin lesions, recording TC-NER on a genome-wide scale. We showed that trabectedin-induced SSBs primarily occur in transcribed strands of active genes and peak near transcription start sites. Frequent SSBs were also found outside gene bodies, connecting TC-NER to divergent transcription from promoters.

Female H. misippus butterflies use two major wing patterning loci (M and A) to imitate the four colour morphs of D. chrysippus found in different regions of Africa. In this study, we examine the evolution of the M locus and identify it as an example of adaptive atavism. This phenomenon involves a morphological reversion to an ancestral character that results in an adaptive phenotype. We show that H. misippus has re-evolved a wing pattern present in other Hypolimnas species for Batesian mimicry of a D. chrysippus morph. Using haplotagging, a linked-read sequencing technology, we discover two large transposable element (TE) insertions located at the M locus and establish that these insertions are present in the dominant allele responsible for producing the ancestral and mimetic phenotype. By conducting a comparative analysis involving additional Hypolimnas species, we demonstrate that the dominant allele is derived. This suggests that the TEs disrupt a cis-regulatory element, leading to the reversion to an ancestral phenotype that is then utilized for Batesian mimicry of a distinct model, a different morph of D. chrysippus. Our findings present a compelling instance of convergent evolution and adaptive atavism, in which the same pattern element has independently evolved multiple times in Hypolimnas butterflies, repeatedly playing a role in Batesian mimicry of diverse model species.",

This study adopts a growth-coupled selection scheme for modular implementation of the Reductive Glycine Pathway (RGP) and subsequent Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE) to enable formate and CO2 assimilation for biomass formation in yeast. We first constructed a serine biosensor strain and then implemented the serine synthesis module of the RGP into yeast, establishing glycine and serine synthesis from formate and CO2. ALE improved the RGP-dependent growth by 8-fold. 13C-labeling experiments reveal glycine, serine, and pyruvate synthesis via the RGP, demonstrating the complete pathway activity. Further, we reestablished formate and CO2-dependent growth in non-evolved biosensor strains via reverse-engineering a mutation in GDH1 identified from ALE. This mutation led to significantly more 13C-formate assimilation than in WT without any selection or overexpression of the RGP. Overall, we demonstrated the activity of the complete RGP, showing evidence for carbon transfer from formate to pyruvate coupled with CO2 assimilation.",

This study examines whether, in what ways, and to what extent this is the case using a sample of 11,538 preprints posted on four preprint servers--bioRxiv, medRxiv, arXiv, and SSRN--that received coverage in 94 English-language media outlets between 2014-2021. We compared mentions of these preprints with mentions of a comparison sample of 397,446 peer reviewed research articles indexed in the Web of Science to identify changes in the share of media coverage that mentioned preprints before and during the pandemic. We found that preprint media coverage increased at a slow but steady rate pre-pandemic, then spiked dramatically. This increase applied only to COVID-19-related preprints, with minimal or no change in coverage of preprints on other topics. In addition, the rise in preprint coverage was most pronounced among health and medicine-focused media outlets, which barely covered preprints before the pandemic but mentioned more COVID-19 preprints than outlets focused on any other topic. These results suggest that the growth in coverage of preprints seen during the pandemic period may imply a shift in journalistic norms, including a changing outlook on reporting preliminary, unvetted research.",

We have previously engineered a liver-targeting adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) that expresses fluorescent protein-tagged albumin to visualize blood plasma in mice.

Mice lacking MMP17 expressed high levels of goblet-cell associated genes, such as CLCA1 and RELM-{beta}, which are normally associated with immune responses to infection. Nevertheless, Mmp17 KO mice did not have altered resistance during a bacterial Citrobacter rodentium infection. However, when challenged with a low dose of the helminth Trichuris muris, Mmp17 KO mice had increased resistance, without a clear role for an altered immune response during infection. Mechanistically, we did not find changes in traditional modulators of goblet cell effectors such as the NOTCH pathway or specific cytokines. Instead, we found elevated BMP signaling in Mmp17 KO mouse large intestinal crypts that we propose to alter the goblet cell maturation state. Together, our data suggests that MMP17 extrinsically alters the goblet cell maturation state via a BMP signaling axis, which is sufficient to alter clearance in a helminth infection model.",

    "abstract": "Interferon-{gamma}-inducible protein of 10 kDa (IP-10/CXCL10) is a dual-function CXC chemokine that coordinates chemotaxis of activated T cells and natural killer (NK) cells via interaction with its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3). As a consequence of natural posttranslational modifications, human CXCL10 exhibits a high degree of structural and functional heterogeneity. However, the biological effect of natural posttranslational processing of CXCL10 at the carboxy (C)-terminus has remained partially elusive. The truncated CXCL10 proteoform CXCL10(1-73), lacking the four endmost C-terminal amino acids, was previously identified in human cell culture supernatant. To further explore the functioning of CXCL10(1-73), we optimized its production in this study through Fmoc-based solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and propose an SPPS strategy to efficiently generate human CXCL10 proteoforms. Compared to intact CXCL10(1-77), CXCL10(1-73) had diminished affinity for glycosaminoglycans including heparin, heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate A. Moreover, CXCL10(1-73) exhibited an attenuated capacity to induce CXCR3A-mediated signaling, as evidenced in calcium mobilization assays and through quantification of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B/Akt. Furthermore, CXCL10(1-73) incited reduced primary human T lymphocyte chemotaxis in vitro and evoked less peritoneal ingress of CXCR3+ T lymphocytes in mice receiving intraperitoneal chemokine injections. In contrast, loss of the four endmost C-terminal residues did not affect the inhibitory properties of CXCL10 on spontaneous and/or FGF-2-induced migration, proliferation, wound healing, phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and sprouting of human microvascular endothelial cells. Thus, C-terminally truncated CXCL10 has attenuated inflammatory properties, but preserved anti-angiogenic capacity.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=135 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/548382v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10c1207org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@173bc5eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@153d6a2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1302a76_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONPrimary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness globally. Characterised by progressive retinal ganglion cell degeneration, the precise pathogenesis remains unknown. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered many genetic variants associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), one of the key risk factors for POAG. This study sought to investigate the morphological and transcriptional consequences of perturbation of key genes at IOP loci in trabecular meshwork cell (TMC); the cellular regulators of IOP. We aimed to identify genetic and morphological variation that can be attributed to TMC dysfunction and raised IOP in POAG.\n\nMETHODS62 genes across 55 loci were knocked-out in a primary human TMC line. Each knockout group, including five non-targeting control groups, underwent single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) for differentially-expressed gene (DEG) analysis. Multiplexed fluorescent staining of key organelles, was coupled with high-throughput microscopy for single-cell morphological analysis using CellProfiler image analysis.\n\nRESULTSAcross many of the individual gene knockouts scRNA-seq highlighted genes relating to matrix metalloproteinases and interferon-induced proteins. Our work has prioritised genes at four loci of interest to identify gene knockouts that may contribute to the pathogenesis of POAG, including ANGPTL2, LMX1B, CAV1, and KREMEN1. Three genetic networks of gene knockouts with similar transcriptomic profiles were identified (ABO / CAV1 / MYOC, ANGPT2 / PKHD1 / TNS1 / TXNRD2, and CAPZA1 / KALRN / LMO7 / PLEKHA7 / GNB1L / TEX41), suggesting a synergistic function in trabecular meshwork cell physiology. TEK knockout caused significant upregulation of nuclear granularity on morphological analysis, whilst knockout of TRIOBP, TMCO1 and PLEKHA7 increased granularity and intensity of actin and the cell-membrane.\n\nCONCLUSIONHigh throughput analysis of cellular structure and function through multiplex fluorescent single-cell analysis and scRNA-seq assays enabled the direct study of genetic perturbations at the single-cell resolution. This work provides a framework for investigating the role of genes in the pathogenesis of glaucoma and heterogenous diseases with a strong genetic basis.",

    "abstract": "Functional genomics techniques, such as transposon insertion sequencing and RNA sequencing, are key to studying relative differences in mutant fitness or gene expression under selective conditions. However, certain stress conditions, mutations, or antibiotics can directly interfere with DNA synthesis, resulting in systematic changes in local DNA copy number along the chromosome. This can lead to artefacts in sequencing-based functional genomics data when comparing antibiotic treatment to an unstressed control, with relative differences in gene-wise read counts being the result of alterations in chromosomal replication dynamics rather than selection or direct gene regulation. We term this artefact  chromosomal location bias and implement a principled statistical approach to correct for it by calculating local normalization factors along the chromosome. These normalization factors are then directly incorporated in statistical analyses using standard RNA-sequencing analysis methods without modifying the read counts themselves, preserving important information about the mean-variance relationship in the data. We illustrate the utility of this approach by generating and analysing a ciprofloxacin-treated transposon insertion sequencing dataset in Escherichia coli as a case study. We show that ciprofloxacin treatment generates chromosomal location bias in the resulting data, and we further demonstrate that failing to correct for this bias leads to false predictions of mutant drug sensitivity as measured by minimum inhibitory concentrations. We have developed an R package and user-friendly graphical Shiny application, ChromoCorrect, that detects and corrects for chromosomal bias in read count data, enabling the application of functional genomics technologies to the study of antibiotic stress.\n\nIMPORTANCEAltered gene dosage due to changes in DNA replication has been observed under a variety of stresses with a variety of experimental techniques. However, the implications of changes in gene dosage for sequencing-based functional genomics assays are rarely considered. We present a statistically principled approach to correcting for the effect of changes in gene dosage, enabling testing for differences in the fitness effects or regulation of individual genes in the presence of confounding differences in DNA copy number. We show that failing to correct for these effects can lead to incorrect predictions of resistance phenotype when applying functional genomics assays to investigate antibiotic stress, and we provide a user-friendly application to detect and correct for changes in DNA copy number.",

    "abstract": "High cathodic overpotential of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in MFC carbon-based cathodes is one of the key barriers to the widespread adoption of the technology. Current Pt-based ORR catalysts are expensive. The use of novel and inexpensive catalysts as replacements for platinum is therefore desirable. In this study, nanomaterials were directly chemically synthesized on carbon microfiber electrodes to improve the performance of lake sediment inoculated MFCs. Nanomaterial of MnO2, MnO2/polyaniline (PANI), ZnO/NiO and ZnO/NiO/PANI attachments were directly chemically synthesized on the carbon material and used as cathode electrodes. The maximum power densities recorded for the different treatments were; MnO2 78.5 mW/m2, MnO2/PANI (Polyaniline) 141.6 mW/m2, ZnO/NiO 67.6 mW/m2, and ZnO/NiO/PANI 129.4 mW/m2. The current and poswer densities were more than six-fold higher in ZnO/NiO/PANI and MnO2/PANI nanoparticle modified cathodes compared to the control MFCs with no catalyst. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and FTIR data and SEM images suggest that the nanoparticle attached carbon material is morphologically, chemically and electrochemically different from the controls with no nanomaterial attachment. The outcome of this study demonstrates that nanomaterials-incorporated carbon microfiber cathodes bring about significant enhancements to power densities and may potentially have applications in cost-effective MFCs.",
