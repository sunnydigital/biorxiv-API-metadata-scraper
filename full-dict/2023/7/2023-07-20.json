    "abstract": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to infect people worldwide, and the virus continues to evolve in significant ways which can pose challenges to the efficiency of available vaccines and therapeutic drugs and cause future pandemic. Therefore, it is important to investigate the binding and interaction of ACE2 with different RBD variants. A comparative study using all-atom MD simulations was conducted on ACE2 binding with 8 different RBD variants, including N501Y, E484K, P479S, T478I, S477N, N439K, K417N and N501Y-E484K-K417N on RBD. Based on the RMSD, RMSF, and DSSP results, the overall binding of RBD variants with ACE2 is stable, and the secondary structures of RBD and ACE2 are consistent after the spot mutation. Besides that, a similar buried surface area, a consistent binding interface and a similar amount of hydrogen bonds formed between RBD with ACE2 although the exact residue pairs on the binding interface were modified. The change of binding free energy from spot mutation was predicted using the free energy perturbation (FEP) method. It is found that N501Y, N439K, and K417N can strengthen the binding of RBD with ACE2, while E484K and P479S weaken the binding, and S477N and T478I have negligible effect on the binding. Spot mutations modified the dynamic correlation of residues in RBD based on the dihedral angle covariance matrix calculation. Doing dynamic network analysis, a common intrinsic network community extending from the tail of RBD to central, then to the binding interface region was found, which could communicate the dynamics in the binding interface region to the tail thus to the other sections of S protein. The result can supply unique methodology and molecular insight on studying the molecular structure and dynamics of possible future pandemics and design novel drugs.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a combination of bioinformatics and molecular dynamics simulations is employed to investigate the partitioning behavior of different classes of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) into model membranes. The main objective is to identify any correlations between the structural characteristics of AMPs and their membrane partitioning mechanisms. The simulation results reveal distinct membrane interactions among the various structural classes of AMPs, particularly in relation to the generation and subsequent interaction with lipid packing defects. Notably, AMPs with a structure-less coil conformation generate a higher number of deep and shallow defects, which are larger in size compared to other classes of AMPs. AMPs with helical component demonstrated the deepest insertion into the membrane. On the other hand, AMPs with a significant percentage of beta sheets tend to adsorb onto the membrane surface, suggesting a potentially distinct partitioning mechanism attributed to their structural rigidity. These findings highlight the diverse membrane interactions and partitioning mechanisms exhibited by different structural classes of AMPs.",

    "abstract": "BRCA1 is a critical tumor suppressor, mutations in which greatly increase risks for many tumors in carriers, most notably breast cancer. Luminal progenitor cells (LPs) are the currently recognized cells origin of BRCA1-deficient breast cancers. However, the reason why LPs are prone to transform with BRCA1 deficiency has not been elucidated. Here, using single-cell sequencing of human BRCA1 mutant breast cancers and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of BRCA1-deficient normal mammary cells, we reveal that replication stress is a feature of LPs and a driving factor during BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, replication stress and BRCA1 deficiency lead to significant upregulation of ELF3 expression. ELF3 can help suppress excessive genomic instability and promote LP transformation with BRCA1 deficiency. Moreover, ELF3 emerged as a core transcription factor regulating LP genes, leading to LP expansion. Our findings suggest that replication stress is a driving factor during BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis in luminal progenitor cells and elucidates the key role of ELF3 during this process.",

    "abstract": "COVID continues to be a major international public health concern, the underlying mechanisms of which are not fully understood. Recent studies suggest that COVID may cause prolonged inflammation within the central nervous system. However, the evidence so far has been limited to few small-scale case studies. To address this, this study leveraged a longitudinal dataset from the UK Biobank that included neuroimaging data prior to and following COVID testing (analytic N=416 including n=224 COVID-positive cases) and applied a novel and non-invasive Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging (DBSI) technique to derive putative indices of neuroinflammation (i.e., restricted fraction; DBSI-RF) for gray matter structures and white matter tracts in the brain. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection would be associated with elevated DBSI markers of putative neuroinflammation and conducted linear regression analyses with adjustment for age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking frequency, and data acquisition interval. After multiple testing correction using false discovery rate, we found no evidence that COVID is associated with variability in neuroinflammation. Several brain regions showed nominally significant differences in DBSI-RF between COVID cases and controls including psychopathology-related regions linked that are either part of (i.e., orbitofrontal cortex) or functionally connected to the olfactory network (e.g., amygdala, caudate). It remains possible that there are acute and transitory neuroinflammatory effects associated with COVID that were not observed in our study due to potential resolution of COVID prior to the scan. Future research is warranted to examine whether neuroinflammation is associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a time- and/or symptom-dependent manner.",

However, many of the host-commensal interactions that likely mediate this protection remain uncharacterised. By screening gnotobiotic mice monocolonised with a range of mouse-derived commensal bacteria we have identified Enterocloster clostridioformis as a protective species against Salmonella Typhimurium infection. Unlike the colonisation resistance induced by some commensal bacteria, E. clostridioformis selectively induces a previously uncharacterised microbe adaptation response at the level of the caecal intestinal epithelium and the underlying mucosal immune system to mediate host-dependent resistance to infection. Triggering this pathway may therefore constitute a novel strategy to enhance protective responses against enteric infections.",

    "abstract": "Emerging variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2 can significantly reduce the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of vaccines and neutralizing antibodies due to mutations in the viral genome. Targeting cell host factors required for infection provides a complementary strategy to overcome this problem since the host genome is less susceptible to variation during the life span of infection. The enzymatic activities of the endosomal PIKfyve phosphoinositide kinase and the serine protease TMPRSS2 are essential to meditate infection in two complementary viral entry pathways. Simultaneous inhibition in cultured cells of their enzymatic activities with the small molecule inhibitors apilimod dimesylate and nafamostat mesylate synergistically prevent viral entry and infection of native SARS-CoV-2 and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-SARS-CoV-2 chimeras expressing the SARS-CoV-2 surface spike (S) protein and of variants of concern. We now report prophylactic prevention of lung infection in mice intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2 beta by combined intranasal delivery of very low doses of apilimod dimesylate and nafamostat mesylate, in a formulation that is stable for over 3 months at room temperature. Administration of these drugs up to 6 hours post infection did not inhibit infection of the lungs but substantially reduced death of infected airway epithelial cells. The efficiency and simplicity of formulation of the drug combination suggests its suitability as prophylactic or therapeutic treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection in households, point of care facilities, and under conditions where refrigeration would not be readily available.",

The role of bacteria as mediators of the 400-million-year-old partnership between the majority of land plants and, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi is still poorly understood. Here we test whether AM hyphae-associated bacteria influence the success of the AM symbiosis. Using partitioned microcosms containing field soil, we discovered that AM hyphae and roots selectively assemble their own microbiome from the surrounding soil. In two independent experiments, we identified several bacterial genera, including Devosia, that are consistently enriched on AM hyphae. Subsequently, we isolated 144 pure bacterial isolates from a mycorrhiza-rich sample of extraradical hyphae and isolated Devosia sp. ZB163 as root and hyphal colonizer. We show that this AM-associated bacterium synergistically acts with mycorrhiza on the plant root to strongly promote plant growth, nitrogen uptake, and mycorrhization. Our results highlight that AM fungi do not function in isolation and that the plant-mycorrhiza symbiont can recruit beneficial bacteria that support the symbiosis.",

    "abstract": "The vertebrate gut microbiota is a critical determinant of organismal function, yet it remains unclear if and how gut microbial communities affect host fitness under natural conditions. Here, we investigate associations between growth rate (a fitness proxy) and gut microbiota diversity and composition in a field experiment with threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We detected on average 63% more bacterial taxa in the guts of high-fitness fish compared to low-fitness fish (i.e., higher -diversity), suggesting that higher diversity promotes host growth. The microbial communities of high-fitness fish had higher similarity (i.e., lower {beta}-diversity) than low-fitness fish, supporting the Anna Karenina principle-- that there are fewer ways to have a functional microbiota than a dysfunctional microbiota. Our findings provide a basis for functional tests of the fitness consequences of host-microbiota interactions.\n\nSignificance statementThe vertebrate gut microbiota is important for many aspects of their hosts biology--such as nutrient metabolism and defense against pathogens--that could ultimately affect host fitness. However, studies investigating the effects of gut microbiota composition on vertebrate host fitness under natural conditions remain exceedingly rare. We tested for associations between gut microbiota diversity and growth rate (a fitness proxy) in threespine stickleback fish reared in large outdoor ponds. We found evidence that a more diverse gut microbiota was predictive of higher growth rate and therefore increased host fitness. Notably, high-fitness fish had higher gut microbiota similarity to one another than did low-fitness fish, providing experimental evidence for the Anna Karenina principle--that there are fewer ways to have a functional microbiota than a dysfunctional microbiota--as it relates to host fitness.",

However, the range of biological functions controlled by hGID remains unexplored. Here, we show that the hGID substrate receptor GID4 regulates cell growth and migration. Biochemical and cellular assays combined with proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID2) revealed that the hGIDGID4 E3-ligase targets the Rho-GAP ARHGAP11A for degradation. Depletion of GID4 or impeding the GID4 substrate binding pocket impairs motility and directed cell movement, whereas knockdown of ARHGAP11A significantly restores the cell migration defect. We found that GID4 controls cell migration by degrading ARHGAP11A thereby preventing its accumulation at the cell periphery where it inactivates RhoA activity. Together, we identified a unique function for GID4, as well as a wide range of substrate profiles beyond Pro/N-degron motifs, which pave the way for deciphering additional pathways regulated by hGID E3 ligase activity through its GID4 substrate receptor.",

The organelle evolved through endosymbiosis with a cyanobacterium, which is exemplified by the outer envelope (OE) membrane that harbors more than 40 proteins in Arabidopsis. Their evolutionary conservation indicates high significance for plant cell function. While a few proteins are well-studied as part of the protein translocon complex the majority of OE protein (OEP) functions is unclear. Gaining a deeper functional understanding has been complicated by the lack of observable loss-of-function mutant phenotypes, which is often rooted in functional genetic redundancy. Therefore, we designed OE-specific artificial micro RNAs (oemiRs) capable of downregulating transcripts from several loci simultaneously. We successfully tested oemiR function by performing a proof-of-concept screen for pale and cold-sensitive mutants. An in-depth analysis of pale mutant alleles deficient in the translocon component TOC75 using proteomics provided new insights into putative compensatory import pathways. The cold stress screen not only recapitulated three previously known phenotypes of cold-sensitive mutants, but also identified four mutants of additional oemiR OE loci. Altogether our study revealed a role of the OE to tolerate cold conditions and showcasts the power of the oemiR collection to research the significance of OEPs.",

    "abstract": "Efferocytosis - the phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells - is a central component of tissue homeostasis, and in many tissues is mediated by the efferocytic receptor MERTK expressed by macrophages. Although MERTK is critical for efferocytosis, the mechanism by which it directs the engulfment of apoptotic cells is largely unknown. Using immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and super-resolution microscopy, we have identified a pre-formed receptor complex on the macrophage plasma membrane comprised of [~]180 nm clusters of MERTK, {beta}2 integrins, and multiple signaling molecules including Src-family kinases, PI3-kinases, and the integrin regulatory proteins ILK and FAK. MERTK is unable to mediate efferocytosis in the absence of {beta}2 integrins or their opsonins, while {beta}2 integrins require activation via MERTK signaling to induce the engulfment of apoptotic cells. Using FRET microscopy, we determined that MERTK directly induces the conformational change of {beta}2 integrins from the low to high-affinity form via a PI3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway. MERTK and {beta}2 integrins then form a highly structured synapse in which MERTK is retained by ligand-induced clustering in the synapse centre, while {beta}2 integrins and actin form a Src family kinase-, ILK- and FAK-dependent expanding ring which defines the leading edge of the synapse that ultimately engulfs the apoptotic cell. The identification of the MERTK membrane-proximal signaling pathway and the role of {beta}2 integrins in this pathway provides new insights into the function of this critical homeostatic receptor and provides new insights into how MERTK mutations and signaling defects may contribute to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.",

This macromolecular complex, consisting of a 20S core particle assembled with one or two 19S regulatory particles, is highly regulated by phosphorylation. Here we describe the Plasmodium berghei proteasome AAA-ATPase regulatory subunit Rpt3 and show that it binds to protein phosphatase 1, the major parasite phosphatase. In addition, PbRpt3 regulates the activity of the phosphatase both in vitro and in a heterologous model of Xenopus oocytes. Using mutagenesis approaches, we observed that the RVXF motifs of PbRpt3 are involved in this binding and activity. Further use of Xenopus oocyte model and mutagenesis based on the 3D model that we established revealed that the binding capacity of PbRpt3 to ATP may also contribute to its phosphatase-regulating activity. In the parasite, reverse genetic studies suggested an essential role for PbRpt3 since no viable knock-out line could be obtained. Additionally, immunoprecipitation assays followed by mass spectrometry analyses using transgenic PbRpt3-tagged parasites not only confirmed that PbRpt3 belongs to the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome, but also revealed potential interaction with proteins already shown to play a role in the phospholipid membrane dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotes house an additional protein synthesis system within the mitochondria. Given that mitochondrial translation dictates OXPHOS complex abundance and ATP levels in cells, exhaustive, quantitative, and high-resolution delineation of mitoribosome traversal is needed. Here, we developed a technique for high-resolution mitochondrial ribosome profiling and unveiled the tight regulation of mammalian in organello translation. Our approach assessed the stoichiometry and kinetics of mitochondrial translation flux, such as the absolute numbers of mitoribosomes on a transcript and the elongation rate, initiation rate, and lifetime rounds of translation of individual transcripts. We also surveyed the impacts of modifications at anticodon stem loop in mt-tRNAs, including all possible decorations at 34th position, by deleting the corresponding enzymes and harnessing patient-derived mtDNA A3243G cells. Moreover, retapamulin-assisted profiling and disome profiling unveiled cryptic translation initiation sites at subcognate codons and programmed mitoribosome collision sites across the mitochondrial transcriptome, respectively. Our work provides a useful resource for delineating protein synthesis within this indispensable organelle.",
