    "abstract": "Mutations in the presenilin (PS) genes are a predominant cause of familial Alzheimers disease (fAD). An ortholog of PS in the genetic model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is sel-12. Mutations in the presenilin genes are commonly thought to lead to fAD by upregulating the expression of amyloid beta (A{beta}), however this hypothesis has been challenged by recent evidence. As C. elegans lack amyloid beta (A{beta}), the goal of this work was to examine A{beta}-independent effects of mutations in sel-12 and PS1/PS2 on behaviour and sensory neuron morphology across the lifespan in a C. elegans model. Olfactory chemotaxis experiments were conducted on sel-12(ok2078) loss-of-function mutant worms. Adult sel-12 mutant worms showed significantly lower levels of chemotaxis to odorants compared to wild-type worms throughout their lifespan, and this deficit increased with age. The chemotaxis phenotype in sel-12 mutant worms is rescued by transgenic over-expression of human wild-type PS1, but not the classic fAD-associated variant PS1C410Y, when expression was driven by either the endogenous sel-12 promoter (Psel-12), a pan-neuronal promoter (Primb-1), or by a promoter whose primary expression was in the sensory neurons responsible for the chemotaxis behavior (Psra-6, Podr-10). The behavioural phenotype was also rescued by over-expressing an atypical fAD-linked mutation in PS1 (PS1{Delta}S169) that has been reported to leave the Notch pathway intact. An examination of the morphology of polymodal nociceptive (ASH) neurons responsible for the chemotaxis behavior also showed increased neurodegeneration over time in sel-12 mutant worms that could be rescued by the same transgenes that rescued the behaviour, demonstrating a parallel with the observed behavioral deficits. Thus, we report an A{beta}-independent neurodegeneration in C. elegans that was rescued by cell specific over-expression of wild-type human presenilin.",

    "abstract": "Basement membranes are thin strong sheets of extracellular matrix. They provide mechanical and biochemical support to epithelia, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels, among other tissues. The mechanical properties of basement membranes are conferred in part by Collagen IV (Col4), an abundant protein of basement membrane that forms an extensive two-dimensional network through head-to-head and tail-to-tail interactions. After the Col4 network is assembled into a basement membrane, it is crosslinked by the matrix-resident enzyme Peroxidasin to form a large covalent polymer. Peroxidasin and Col4 crosslinking are highly conserved, indicating they are essential, but homozygous mutant mice have mild phenotypes. To explore the role of Peroxidasin, we analyzed mutants in Drosophila, including a newly generated catalytic null, and found that homozygotes were mostly lethal with 13% viable escapers. A Mendelian analysis of mouse mutants shows a similar pattern, with homozygotes displaying [~]50% lethality and [~]50% escapers. Despite the strong mutations, the homozygous escapers had low but detectable levels of Col4 crosslinking, indicating that inefficient alternative mechanisms exist and that are probably responsible for the viable escapers. Further, fly mutants have phenotypes consistent with a decrease in stiffness. Interestingly, we found that even after adult basement membranes are assembled and crosslinked, Peroxidasin is still required to maintain stiffness. These results suggest that Peroxidasin crosslinking may be more important than previously appreciated.",

    "abstract": "Engaging in undergraduate research experiences is known to have broad and positive impacts on college students. Despite the benefits, achieving faculty buy-in and support can be challenging even when faculty have strong research funding. In order to understand how to better support undergraduate research programs, we applied quantitative models to explore how the impact of research funding is mediated by faculty beliefs about undergraduate research mentoring in STEM disciplines. The results indicate that faculty characteristics and beliefs about the benefits and barriers of mentoring undergraduate students in research impact the number of students mentored even when accounting for research funding levels of the individual faculty. Practical recommendations are presented based on the models from this research project in order to provide insight into how centers or units on a campus may work with faculty to support and encourage mentoring of undergraduates in research in the biomedical sciences.",
