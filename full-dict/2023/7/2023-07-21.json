    "abstract": "Axons are thought to be ultrathin membrane cables of a relatively uniform diameter, designed to conduct electrical signals, or action potentials. Here, we demonstrate that unmyelinated axons are not simple cylindrical tubes. Rather, axons have nanoscopic boutons repeatedly along their length interspersed with a thin cable with a diameter of [~]60 nm like pearls-on-a-string. These boutons are only [~]200 nm in diameter and do not have synaptic contacts or a cluster of synaptic vesicles, hence non-synaptic. Our in silico modeling suggests that axon pearling can be explained by the mechanical properties of the membrane including the bending modulus and tension. Consistent with modeling predictions, treatments that disrupt these parameters like hyper- or hypo-tonic solutions, cholesterol removal, and non-muscle myosin II inhibition all alter the degree of axon pearling, suggesting that axon morphology is indeed determined by the membrane mechanics. Intriguingly, neuronal activity modulates the cholesterol level of plasma membrane, leading to shrinkage of axon pearls. Consequently, the conduction velocity of action potentials becomes slower. These data reveal that biophysical forces dictate axon morphology and function and that modulation of membrane mechanics likely underlies plasticity of unmyelinated axons.",

    "abstract": "Voltage imaging with cellular specificity has been made possible by the tremendous advances in genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs). However, the kilohertz rates required for voltage imaging lead to weak signals. Moreover, out-of-focus fluorescence and tissue scattering produce background that both undermines signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and induces crosstalk between cells, making reliable in vivo imaging in densely labeled tissue highly challenging. We describe a microscope that combines the distinct advantages of targeted illumination and confocal gating, while also maximizing signal detection efficiency. The resulting benefits in SNR and crosstalk reduction are quantified experimentally and theoretically. Our microscope provides a versatile solution for enabling high-fidelity in vivo voltage imaging at large scales and penetration depths, which we demonstrate across a wide range of imaging conditions and different GEVI classes.",

Here, we investigate this in mice expressing a doxycycline-inducible RNAi against Atg5 (Atg5i). Systemic autophagy inhibition in Atg5i mice resulted in the morphological and functional abrogation of the male accessory sex organs, leading to male subfertility. However, the testis was largely protected, likely due to the limited permeability of doxycycline through the blood-testis barrier. Interestingly, restoration of autophagy by doxycycline withdrawal in Atg5i mice led to substantial recovery of the phenotype in the accessory organs. This model offers a unique opportunity to dissect the pre- and post-testicular roles of autophagy, highlighting the non-autonomous impact of autophagy on male fertility.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between people and wildlife are increasing as developments encroach on nature. Concurrently, neonatal and juvenile mammals are presented to rehabilitation centers as real or perceived \"orphans\", believed to be lacking appropriate parental care for survival. Four common orphaned mammals presented to wildlife rehabilitation facilities are the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana, DIVI), common raccoon (Procyon lotor, PRLO), eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis, SCCA), and eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus, SYFL). As some individuals are unnecessarily taken from their habitat, there is a benefit to characterizing where they are collected. This study utilized Geographic Information System to examine the spatial relationship between the environment and originating locations of orphans presented to the University of Illinois Wildlife Medical Clinic within Champaign County from 2015-2020 (99 Virginia opossums, 80 common raccoons, 441 eastern gray squirrels, and 602 eastern cottontails). Environmental factors evaluated included percent tree canopy, land cover classification, and distance to water. Overall, these species were frequently found in highly developed areas (p < 0.001), near water (p < 0.027), with a low percent canopy (p < 0.001). Our analysis identifies environments associated with greater human-wildlife interactions and opportunities for targeted educational outreach.",

    "abstract": "The use of polygenic risk score (PRS) models has transformed the field of genetics by enabling the prediction of complex traits and diseases based on an individuals genetic profile. However, the impact of genotype-environment interaction (GxE) on the performance and applicability of PRS models remains a crucial aspect to be explored. Currently, existing GxE PRS models are often inappropriately used, which can result in inflated type 1 error rates and compromised results. In this study, we propose a novel GxE PRS model that correctly incorporates the GxE component to analyze complex traits and diseases. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing models in terms of controlling type 1 error rates and enhancing statistical power. Furthermore, we apply the proposed model to real data, and report significant GxE effects. Specifically, we highlight the impact of our model on both quantitative and binary traits. For quantitative traits, we uncover the GxE modulation of genetic effects on body mass index (BMI) by alcohol intake frequency (ALC). In the case of binary traits, we identify the GxE modulation of genetic effects on hypertension (HYP) by waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). These findings underscore the importance of employing a robust model that effectively controls type 1 error rates, thus preventing the occurrence of spurious GxE signals. To facilitate the implementation of our approach, we have developed an innovative R software package called GxE PRS, specifically designed to detect and estimate GxE effects. Overall, our study highlights the importance of accurate GxE modeling and its implications for genetic risk prediction, while providing a practical tool to support further research in this area.",

The size of assembled genome was 2.33 Gb consisting of 4070 scaffolds (N50=42.06Mb), of which 92.05% were assigned to 26 pseudochromosomes in A and B sub-genomes. A phylogenetic analysis with the T. sagittata and other 16 plant genomes estimated the evolutionary placement of T. sagittata and its divergence time in Ranunculales. Further genome evolution analysis characterized one round tandem duplication about 1.5 million years ago (MYA) and one whole-genome duplication (WGD) about 86.9 MYA. WGD contributed to the duplication of clade-specific cytochrome P450 gene family in Ranunculales. Moreover, sequencing mining obtained genome-wide genes involved in the biosynthesis of alkaloids and terpenoids. TsA02G014550, one candidate, was functionally characterized to catalyze the formation of (S)-canadine in the jatrorrhizine biosynthetic pathway. Taken together, the assembled genome of T. sagittata provides useful sequences to understand the biosynthesis of jatrorrhizine and other BIAs in plants.",

    "abstract": "Mutualistic interactions, which constitute some of the most advantageous interactions among fish species, are highly vulnerable to environmental changes. A key mutualistic interaction is the cleaning service rendered by the cleaner wrasse, Labroides dimidiatus, which involves intricate processes of social behaviour to remove ectoparasites from client fish and can be altered in near-future environmental conditions. Here, we evaluated the neuromolecular mechanisms behind the behavioural disruption of cleaning interactions in response to future environments. We subjected cleaner wrasses and surgeonfish (Acanthurus leucosternon, serving as clients) to elevated temperature (Warming, 32{degrees}C), increased levels of CO2 (High CO2, 1000 ppm), and a combined condition of elevated CO2 and temperature (Warming & High CO2, 32{degrees}C & 1000 ppm) for 28 days. Each of these conditions resulted in behavioural disruptions concerning the motivation to interact and the quality of interaction (High CO2 -80.7%, Warming - 92.6%, Warming & High CO2 -79.5%, p<0.001). Using transcriptomic of the fore-, mid-, and hindbrain, we discovered that most transcriptional reprogramming in both species under warming conditions occurred primarily in the hind- and forebrain. The associated functions under warming were linked to stress, heat shock proteins, hypoxia, and behaviour. In contrast, elevated CO2 exposure affected a range of functions associated with GABA, behaviour, visual perception, and circadian rhythm. Interestingly, in the combined Warming & High CO2 condition, we did not observe any expression changes of behaviour. However, we did find signs of endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis, suggesting not only an additive effect of the environmental conditions but also a trade-off between physiological performance and behaviour in the cleaner wrasse. We suggest that impending environmental shifts can affect the behaviour and molecular processes that sustain mutualistic interactions between L. dimidiatus and its clients, which could have a cascading effect on their adaptation potential and possibly cause large-scale impacts on coral reef ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous interactions between nucleotides and lipid membranes are likely to have played a prominent role in the emergence of life on Earth. However, the effect of nucleotides on the physicochemical properties of model protocellular membranes is relatively less understood. To this end, we aimed to discern the effect of canonical nucleotides on the properties of single-chain amphiphile membranes under prebiotically relevant conditions of multiple wet-dry cycles. Furthermore, the change in critical aggregation concentration of the membranes, and their stability in the presence of nucleotides, was also investigated in Astrobiologically analogue environments. We report that different nucleotides, lipid headgroups, and the ionic makeup of the system affect lipid-nucleotide interactions, which in turn can modulate the effect of nucleotides on the membranes. Specifically, oleic acid membranes seemingly showed an increase in the critical aggregation concentration, and an increase in the stability against prebiotically relevant selection pressures, in the presence of certain nucleotides. Our work has implications for understanding how nucleotides might have shaped the protocellular landscape of the prebiotic Earth.",

    "abstract": "Interpreting the tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity within solid tumors presents a cornerstone for precise disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, while spatial transcriptomics offers a wealth of data, ranging from gene expression and spatial location to corresponding Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) images, to explore the TME of various cancers, its high cost and demanding infrastructural needs significantly limit its clinical application, highlighting the need for more accessible alternatives. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Integrated Graph and Image Deep Learning (IGI-DL) model. This innovation, a fusion of Convolutional Neural Networks and Graph Neural Networks, is designed to predict gene spatial expression using HE images. The IGI-DL model outperforms its predecessors in analyzing colorectal cancer (CRC), breast cancer, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) by leveraging both pixel intensity and structural features in images. Significantly, across all cancer types, the IGI-DL model enhances the mean correlation of the top five genes by an average of 0.125 in internal and external test sets, rising from 0.306 to 0.431, surpassing existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. We further present a novel risk score derived from a super-patch graph, where gene expression predicted by IGI-DL serves as node features. Demonstrating superior prognostic accuracy, this risk score, with a C-index of 0.713 and 0.741 for CRC and breast cancer, supersedes traditional HE-based risk scores. In summary, the approach augments our understanding of the TME from the aspect of histological images, portending a transformation in cancer prognostics and treatment planning and ushering in a new era of personalized and precision oncology.",

In cross-project defect prediction, we extract knowledge from the source project and apply that learned knowledge to predict labels for the target project. However, the model performance can be affected by features that are insignificant and irrelevant. Hybrid feature selection (HFS) can play a significant role in achieving high prediction accuracy by selecting significant and only relevant features. Our aim is to explore effect of significant feature selection through a hybrid approach upon cross-project (CP) defect prediction for datasets which are multi-class in nature. We leveraged the strengths of Random Forest (RF) and Recursive Feature Elimination Cross Validation (RFECV) which can constructively select few features which are significant. The design of our controlled experiment is 1 Factor 2 Treatments (1F2T). Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) proves that all versions of PROMISE repository are multi class and have duplicated rows in data, distribution gap among values, and imbalance classes. Hence after removing duplicated rows, reducing the gap present in distribution of data, and balancing classes, we selected significant feature set through Hybrid approach i.e. Random Forest (RF) and Recursive Feature Elimination Cross Validation (RFECV). We used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a classifier to predict Cross project defects along with SoftMax as the last layer. Our experimental setup resulted in the average 78% prediction accuracy measure of all 14 versions in terms of AUC. Our experimental result showed that there is significant impact of HFS on defect prediction accuracy for different datasets in the CP.",

    "abstract": "The centrosome is a major microtubule-organizing center in animal cells. The intracellular positioning of the centrosomes is important for proper cellular function. One of the features of centrosome positioning is the spacing between centrosomes. The spacing activity is mediated by microtubules extending from the centrosomes; however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. To characterize the spacing activity in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, a genetic setup was developed to produce enucleated embryos. The centrosome duplicated multiple times in the enucleated embryo, which enabled us to characterize the chromosome-independent spacing activity between sister and non-sister centrosome pairs. We knocked down genes in the enucleated embryo and found that the timely spacing was dependent on cytoplasmic dynein. Based on these results, we propose a stoichiometric model of cortical and cytoplasmic pulling forces for the spacing between centrosomes. We also found a dynein-independent but non-muscle myosin II-dependent movement of the centrosomes in a later cell cycle phase. The dynein-dependent spacing mechanisms for positioning the centrosomes revealed in this study is likely functioning in the cell with nucleus and chromosomes, including the processes of centrosome separation and spindle elongation.",

    "abstract": "Calcium binding protein, spermatid associated 1 (CABS1) is a protein most widely studied in spermatogenesis. However, mRNA for CABS1 has been found in numerous tissues, albeit with little information about the protein. Previously, we identified CABS1 mRNA and protein in human salivary glands and provided evidence that in humans CABS1 contains a heptapeptide near its carboxyl terminus that has anti-inflammatory activities. Moreover, levels of an immunoreactive form of CABS1 were elevated in psychological stress. To more fully characterize human CABS1 we developed additional polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to different sections of the protein and used these antibodies to characterize CABS1 in an overexpression cell lysate, human salivary glands, saliva, serum and testes using western blot, immunohistochemistry and bioinformatics approaches exploiting the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. CABS1 appears to have multiple molecular weight forms, consistent with its recognition as a structurally disordered protein, a protein with structural plasticity. Interestingly, in human testes, its cellular distribution differs from that in rodents and pigs, and includes Leydig cells, primary spermatogonia, Sertoli cells and developing spermatocytes and spermatids, Geodata suggests that CABS1 is much more widely distributed than previously recognized, including in the urogenital, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, as well as in the nervous system, immune system and other tissues.

    "abstract": "Direct reprogramming is a technique for inducing the conversion of one type of somatic cell into another by the forced expression of defined transcription factors. Cell differentiation is generally determined by specific gene expression profiles based on distinct genome-wide epigenetic signatures. Although the CpG methylation of genomic DNA is an essential epigenetic factor that affects the transcriptional state of genes, little is known about how DNA methylation changes and what roles it plays in direct reprogramming. Here, we performed comparative genome-wide DNA methylation analyses of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and cells composing organoids formed by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) or induced ISCs (iISCs) that were directly induced from MEFs to investigate the impact of DNA methylation dynamics on direct reprogramming. We found that the methylation state of CpG was similar between cells forming ISC organoids and iISC organoids, while they differed widely from those in MEFs. Moreover, genomic regions that were differentially methylated between ISC organoid- and iISC organoid-forming cells did not significantly affect gene expression. These results demonstrate the accuracy and safety of iISC induction, as they show that the DNA methylation state transitions to a state close to that of ISCs during direct reprogramming from MEFs to iISCs.",

    "abstract": "GCN5L1, also known as BLOC1S1 and BLOS1, is a small intracellular protein involved in a number of key biological processes. Over the last decade, GCN5L1 has been implicated in the regulation of protein lysine acetylation, energy metabolism, endo-lysosomal function, and cellular immune pathways. An increasing number of published papers have used commercially-available reagents to interrogate GCN5L1 function. However, in many cases these reagents have not been rigorously validated, leading to potentially misleading results. In this report we tested several commercially-available antibodies for GCN5L1, and found that two-thirds of those available did not unambiguously detect the protein by western blot in cultured mouse cells or ex vivo liver tissue. These data suggest that previously published studies which used these unverified antibodies to measure GCN5L1 protein abundance, in the absence of other independent methods of corroboration, should be interpreted with appropriate caution.",

    "abstract": "Modeling has proposed that the amount of neural tissue folding is set by the level of differential-expansion between tissue layers and that the wavelength is set by the thickness of the outer layer. Here we used inbred mouse strains with distinct amounts of cerebellar folding to investigate these predictions. We identified a critical period where the folding amount diverges between the strains. In this period, regional changes in the level of differential-expansion between the external granule layer (EGL) and underlying core correlate with the folding amount in each strain. Additionally, the thickness of the EGL is regionally adjusted during the critical period alongside corresponding changes in wavelength. While the number of SHH-expressing Purkinje cells predicts the folding amount, the proliferation rate in the EGL is the same between the strains. However, regional changes in the cell division angle within the EGL predicts both the tangential-expansion and thickness of the EGL. Cell division angle is likely a tunable mechanism whereby both the level of differential-expansion and thickness of the EGL are regionally tuned to set the amount and wavelength of folding.",

    "abstract": "Despite drastic cellular changes during cleavage divisions, a mitotic spindle is assembled in each blastomere to accurately segregate duplicated chromosomes. Recent studies indicate that early embryonic divisions are highly error-prone in bovines and humans. However, processes and mechanisms of embryonic spindle assembly remain little understood in vertebrates. Here, we established live functional assay systems in medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) embryos by combining CRISPR knock-in with an auxin-inducible degron technology. In contrast to mammals, mitoses during cleavage divisions are very rapid (<12 min), but segregation errors are rarely observed. Importantly, we found that the Ran-GTP gradient assembles a specialized, dense microtubule network at the spindle midplane during metaphase, which is essential for faithful chromosome segregation in early embryos. In contrast, Ran-GTP becomes dispensable for chromosome segregation in later stages, where spindles are morphologically remodeled into short, somatic-like spindles lacking the dense microtubule network. We propose that the specialized Ran-based spindle structure ensures high fidelity of chromosome segregation in large, vertebrate early embryos.",

    "abstract": "Organ formation requires precise regulation of cell cycle and morphogenetic events. Using the Drosophila embryonic salivary gland (SG) as a model, we uncover the role of the SP1/KLF transcription factor Huckebein (Hkb) in coordinating cell cycle regulation and morphogenesis. The hkb mutant SG exhibits defects in invagination positioning and organ size due to abnormal death of SG cells. Normal SG development involves distal-to-proximal progression of endoreplication (endocycle), whereas hkb mutant SG cells undergo abnormal cell division, leading to cell death. Hkb represses the expression of key cell cycle and pro-apoptotic genes in the SG. Knockdown of cyclin E or cyclin-dependent kinase 1, or overexpression of fizzy-related rescues most of the morphogenetic defects observed in the hkb mutant SG. These results indicate that Hkb plays a critical role in controlling endoreplication by regulating the transcription of key cell cycle effectors to ensure proper organ formation.",

Decades of work exploring how environmental stochasticity influences population dynamics have highlighted the ability of some natural populations to limit the negative effects of environmental stochasticity, one of these strategies being demographic buffering. Whilst various methods exist to quantify demographic buffering, we still do not know which environment factors and demographic characteristics are most responsible for the demographic buffering observed in natural populations. Here, we introduce a framework to quantify the relative effects of three key drivers of demographic buffering: environment components (e.g., temporal autocorrelation and variance), population structure, and demographic rates (e.g., progression and fertility). Using Integral Projection Models, we explore how these drivers impact the demographic buffering abilities of three plant species with different life histories and demonstrate how our approach successfully characterises a populations capacity to demographically buffer against environmental stochasticity in a changing world.",

Here, we investigate how the assumption of similar effect sizes affects the model: in particular, if the tail of the effect size distribution is polynomial with exponent  < 2, then sums of effects should be well-approximated by a \"stable distribution\", and find tail exponents between 1 and 2 in effect sizes estimated by genome-wide association studies of many human disease-related traits. We show that the independence of offspring trait deviations from parental averages in many cases implies a Gaussian distribution, suggesting that non-Gaussian models of trait evolution must explicitly track the underlying genetics, at least for loci of large effect. We also characterize possible limiting trait distributions of the infinitesimal model with infinitely divisible noise distributions, and compare our results to simulations.",

An ISG15-specific member of the deubiquitylase family, USP18, is up-regulated in a co-ordinated manner. USP18 can also provide a negative feedback by inhibiting JAK-STAT signaling through protein interactions independently of DUB activity. Here, we provide an acute example of this phenomenon, whereby the early expression of USP18, post-interferon treatment of HCT116 colon cancer cells is sufficient to fully suppress the expression of the ISG15 E1 enzyme, UBA7. Stimulation of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells with interferon reduces their growth rate but they remain viable. In contrast, A549 USP18 knock-out cells show similar growth characteristics under basal conditions, but upon interferon stimulation a profound inhibition of cell growth is observed. We show that this contingency on USP18 is independent of ISGylation, suggesting non catalytic functions are required for viability. We also demonstrate that global deISGylation kinetics are very slow compared with deubiquitylation. This is not influenced by USP18 expression, suggesting that enhanced ISGylation in USP18 KO cells reflects increased conjugating activity.",

To begin to address this need, we have generated iPSCs from dermal fibroblasts isolated from a healthy 60-year-old indigenous Nigerian male belonging to the Babur ethnic group. The iPSCs were generated using Sendai virus, and copy number variation (CNV) analysis revealed no new major abnormalities compared to the parental fibroblasts. The iPSCs have been characterised for pluripotency markers and morphology and successfully differentiated into neural progenitor cells and astrocytes. This iPSC line could serve as a healthy control in comparative studies and can be used in disease modelling, toxicity assessments, genetic analyses, and drug discovery processes within an African genetic background. To bolster the inclusion of African models in biomedical research, this iPSC line will be made available to the broader scientific community.

    "abstract": "Neosynthesized plasma membrane (PM) proteins co-translationally translocate to the ER, concentrate at regions called ER-exit sites (ERes) and pack into COPII secretory vesicles which are sorted to the early-Golgi through membrane fusion. Following Golgi maturation, membrane cargoes reach the late-Golgi, from where they exit in clathrin-coated vesicles destined to the PM, directly or through endosomes. Post-Golgi membrane cargo trafficking also involves the cytoskeleton and the exocyst. The Golgi-dependent secretory pathway is thought to be responsible for the trafficking of all major membrane proteins. However, our recent findings in Aspergillus nidulans showed that several plasma membrane cargoes, such as transporters and receptors, follow a sorting route that seems to bypass Golgi functioning. To gain insight on membrane trafficking and specifically Golgi-bypass, here we used proximity dependent biotinylation (PDB) coupled with data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) for identifying transient interactors of the UapA transporter. Our assays, which included proteomes of wild-type and mutant strains affecting ER-exit or endocytosis, identified both expected and novel interactions that might be physiologically relevant to UapA trafficking. Among those, we validated, using reverse genetics and fluorescence microscopy, that COPI coatomer is essential for ER-exit and anterograde trafficking of UapA and other membrane cargoes. We also showed that ArfAArf1 GTPase activating protein (GAP) Glo3 contributes to UapA trafficking at increased temperature. This is the first report addressing the identification of transient interactions during membrane cargo biogenesis using PDB and proteomics coupled with fungal genetics.

    "abstract": "Tendon injuries are a major clinical problem, with poor patient outcomes caused by abundant scar tissue deposition during healing. Myofibroblasts play a critical role in the initial restoration of structural integrity after injury. However, persistent myofibroblast activity drives the transition to fibrotic scar tissue formation. As such, disrupting myofibroblast persistence is a key therapeutic target. While myofibroblasts are typically defined by the presence of SMA+ stress fibers, SMA is expressed in other cell types including the vasculature. As such, modulation of myofibroblast dynamics via disruption of SMA expression is not a translationally tenable approach. Recent work has demonstrated that Periostin-lineage (PostnLin) cells are a precursor for cardiac fibrosis-associated myofibroblasts. In contrast to this, here we show that PostnLin cells contribute to a transient SMA+ myofibroblast population that is required for functional tendon healing, and that Periostin forms a supportive matrix niche that facilitates myofibroblast differentiation and persistence. Collectively, these data identify the Periostin matrix niche as a critical regulator of myofibroblast fate and persistence that could be targeted for therapeutic manipulation to facilitate regenerative tendon healing.",

    "abstract": "Local Cdc42 GTPase activation promotes polarized exocytosis, resulting in membrane flows that deplete low-mobility membrane-associated proteins from the growth region. To investigate the self-organizing properties of the Cdc42 secretion-polarization system under membrane flow, we developed a reaction-diffusion particle model. The model includes positive feedback activation of Cdc42, hydrolysis by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), and flow-induced displacement by exo/endocytosis. Simulations show how polarization relies on flow-induced depletion of low mobility GAPs. To probe the role of Cdc42 mobility in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we changed its membrane binding properties by replacing its prenylation site with 1, 2 or 3 repeats of the Rit1 C terminal membrane binding domain (ritC), yielding alleles with progressively lower unbinding and diffusion rates. Concordant modelling predictions and experimental observations show that lower Cdc42 mobility results in lower Cdc42 activation level and wider patches. Indeed, while Cdc42-1ritC cells are viable and polarized, Cdc42-2ritC polarize poorly and Cdc42-3ritC is inviable. The model further predicts that GAP depletion increases Cdc42 activity at the expense of loss of polarization. Experiments confirm this prediction, as deletion of Cdc42 GAPs restores viability to Cdc42-3ritC cells. Our combined experimental and modelling studies demonstrate how membrane flows are an integral part of Cdc42-driven pattern formation.\n\nSignificance StatementThe delivery of new membrane from internal pools at zones of polarized secretion induces in-plane plasma membrane flows that displace slowly mobile membrane-associated proteins from the zone of secretion. However, zones of polarized secretion are themselves specified by the activity of membrane-associated polarity factors, such as the small GTPase Cdc42. Through combined modelling and experimental approaches, this work demonstrates that the fast mobility of the Cdc42 GTPase is critical to allow the establishment and maintenance of a polarity patch, which is reinforced by flow-mediated displacement of a negative regulator.",

    "abstract": "Collective cell migration occurs in various biological processes such as development, wound healing and metastasis. During Drosophila oogenesis, border cells (BC) form a cluster that migrates collectively inside the egg chamber. The Ste20-like kinase Misshapen (Msn) is a key regulator of BC migration coordinating the restriction of protrusion formation and contractile forces within the cluster. Here, we demonstrate that the kinase Tao acts as an upstream activator of Msn in BCs. Depletion of Tao significantly impedes BC migration and produces a phenotype similar to Msn loss-of-function. Furthermore, we show that the localization of Msn relies on its CNH domain, which interacts with the small GTPase Rap2l. Our findings indicate that Rap2l promotes the trafficking of Msn to the endolysosomal pathway. When Rap2l is depleted, the levels of Msn increase in the cytoplasm and at cell-cell junctions between BCs. Overall, our data suggest that Rap2l ensures that the levels of Msn are higher at the periphery of the cluster through the targeting of Msn to the degradative pathway. Together, we identified two distinct regulatory mechanisms that ensure the appropriate distribution and activation of Msn in BCs.",

    "abstract": "Cell migration is a fundamental process during embryonic development. Most studies on cell migration in vivo have focussed on the migration of cells using the extracellular matrix (ECM) as their substrate for migration. In contrast, much less is known about how cells migrate on other cells, as found in early embryos when the ECM has not yet formed. Here, we show that lateral mesendoderm (LME) cells in the early zebrafish gastrula use the overlying ectoderm as their substrate for migration. We show that the lateral ectoderm is permissive for the animal pole-directed migration of LME cells, while the ectoderm at the animal pole of the gastrula halts animal pole-directed LME migration. These differences in the permissive properties of the ectoderm for LME migration are due to the lateral ectoderm being more cohesive and viscous than the animal ectoderm. Consistently, tuning cell contractility in lateral and animal ectoderm via modulation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton is sufficient to change their permissiveness for LME migration. Finally, we found that BMP signalling is critical for reducing animal ectoderm cohesion and, thus, its capacity to halt LME migration towards the animal pole. Collectively, these findings identify a critical role of ectoderm tissue cohesion and viscosity in guiding LME migration during zebrafish gastrulation.",
