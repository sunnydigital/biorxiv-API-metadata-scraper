    "abstract": "Aphids harbor nine heritable facultative symbionts, most mediating one or more ecological interactions. However, one aphid symbiont, Wolbachia, has eluded functional characterization despite being well-studied in other arthropods. In Pentalonia aphids, global pests of banana, Wolbachia was hypothesized to function as a co-obligate symbiont alongside the traditional obligate Buchnera, but subsequent genomic analyses failed to support this role. Sampling across multiple aphid populations, we found that > 80% of Pentalonia aphids carried a M-supergroup strain of Wolbachia named wPni. While the lack of fixation confirms that Wolbachia is not a co-obligate symbiont, the high infection frequencies in these entirely asexual aphids strongly suggested Wolbachia confers net fitness benefits. Finding no correlation between Wolbachia and aphid food plants use, we challenged Wolbachia-infected aphids with common natural enemies. While Wolbachia did not protect aphids against parasitoids, this symbiont conferred significant protection against the specialized fungal pathogen, Pandora neoaphidis, and improved aphid fitness in the absence of enemy challenge. Thus, we identified a new phenotype for the multifaceted Wolbachia and highlight a system that provides unique opportunities to merge key models of heritable symbiosis to better understand infection dynamics in nature and mechanisms underpinning symbiont-mediated phenotypes.\n\nIMPORTANCE: Wolbachia symbionts spread and persist in a wide range of arthropods and nematodes by using a range of functional strategies, including reproductive manipulation, providing protection against viral and bacterial pathogens or by provisioning nutrients. Despite being one of the best-studied symbionts, little is known about the strains that infect aphids. In this study, we characterized the functional role of a Supergroup M Wolbachia strain infecting strictly asexual aphids of the genus Pentalonia. We report for the first time that this symbiont also defends against fungal entomopathogens and expand on the range of phenotypes conferred by this multifaceted symbiont.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile is a gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium that is responsible for antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) symptoms can range from diarrhea to life-threatening colon damage. Toxins produced by C. difficile (TcdA and TcdB) cause intestinal epithelial injury and lead to severe gut barrier dysfunction, stem cell damage, and impaired regeneration of the gut epithelium. Current treatment options for intestinal repair are limited. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment with the microbial metabolite urolithin A (UroA) attenuates CDI-induced adverse effects on the colon epithelium in a preclinical model of CDI-induced colitis. Moreover, our analysis suggests that UroA treatment protects against C. difficile-induced inflammation, disruption of gut barrier integrity, and intestinal tight junction proteins in the colon of CDI mice. Importantly, UroA treatment significantly reduced the expression and release of toxins from C. difficile, without inducing bacterial cell death. These results indicate the direct regulatory effects of UroA on bacterial gene regulation. Overall, our findings reveal a novel aspect of UroA activities, as it appears to act at both the bacterial and host levels to protect against CDI-induced colitis pathogenesis. This research sheds light on a promising avenue for the development of novel treatments for C. difficile infection.\n\nImportanceTherapy for C. difficile infections includes the use of antibiotics, immunosuppressors, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). However, these treatments have several drawbacks, including the loss of colonization resistance, promotion of autoimmune disorders, and the potential for unknown pathogens in donor samples. To date, the potential benefits of microbial metabolites in CDI-induced colitis have not been fully investigated. Here, we report for the first time that the microbial metabolite Urolithin A has the potential to block toxin production from C. difficile and enhance gut barrier function to mitigate CDI-induced colitis.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance causes 1.27 million global deaths annually and is predicted to worsen. Heteroresistance is a form of resistance in which only a minor and unstable subpopulation of cells of a bacterial isolate are resistant to a given antibiotic, and are therefore often undetected by clinical diagnostics. These infrequent and undetected resistant cells can be selected during antibiotic therapy, expand in number, and cause unexplained treatment failures. A major question is how heteroresistance evolves. Here, studying the antibiotic fosfomycin, we report that heteroresistance can develop from a pre-existing state of phenotypic heterogeneity in which an isolate harbors a subpopulation with increased minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), but below the clinical resistance breakpoint. We call this phenomenon heterosusceptibility and demonstrate that acquisition of a resistance gene, fosA, increases the MIC of the subpopulation beyond the breakpoint, making the isolate heteroresistant. Conversely, deletion of fosA from a heteroresistant isolate led to reduction of the MIC of the resistant subpopulation without a loss of heterogeneity, thus generating heterosusceptibility. A survey of 103 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) revealed that the Escherichia sp. isolates lacked the fosA gene and uniformly exhibited fosfomycin heterosusceptibility, whereas the Klebsiella and Enterobacter encoded the fosA gene and were almost exclusively heteroresistant. Furthermore, some isolates exhibited heterosusceptibility to other antibiotics, demonstrating that this is a widespread phenomenon. These results highlight a mechanism for the evolution of heteroresistance and suggest that surveillance for heterosusceptibility may facilitate the prediction of impending heteroresistance before it evolves.",

    "abstract": "Reporter assays, in which the expression of an inert protein is driven by gene regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers, are a workhorse for investigating gene regulation. Techniques for measuring reporter gene expression vary from single-cell or single-molecule approaches having low throughput to bulk Luciferase assays that have high throughput. We developed a Luciferase Reporter Assay using Flow-Cytometry (LucFlow), which measures reporter expression in single cells immunostained for Luciferase. We optimized and tested LucFlow with a murine cell line that can be differentiated into neutrophils, into which promoter-reporter and enhancer-promoter-reporter constructs have been integrated in a site-specific manner. The single-cell measurements are comparable to bulk ones but we found that dead cells have no detectable Luciferase protein, so that bulk assays underestimate reporter expression. LucFlow is able to achieve a higher accuracy than bulk methods by excluding dead cells during flow cytometry. Prior to fixation and staining, the samples are spiked with stained cells that can be discriminated during flow cytometry and control for tube-to-tube variation in experimental conditions. Computing fold change relative to control cells allows LucFlow to achieve a high level of precision. LucFlow, therefore, enables the accurate and precise measurement of reporter expression in a high throughput manner.",

    "abstract": "DNA barcoding is currently an effective and extensively used tool for species identification. The chloroplast matK (maturase K) and rbcL (Ribulose-bisphosphate large subunit) are one of the most variable coding genes of angiosperms and have been recommended as a universal barcode for land plants. Aloe is a large genus of around 500 species, and most species are widely used for traditional medicinal purposes worldwide, viz., Aloe vera, Aloe ferox, Aloe arborescens, and Aloe maculate. This study evaluated the two chloroplast DNA barcodes (matK and rbcL) to develop a theoretical base for species identification and germplasm conservation of Aloe species. The Maximum Parsimony analysis was conducted to study the evolutionary relatedness of Aloe sequences using matK and rbcL sequences retrieved from the NCBI database. The results revealed that 49 Aloe accessions were segregated into four major clades based on the matK sequence. Likewise, the 29 Aloe accessions were distributed into two major clades based on the rbcL sequence. SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) site analysis was conducted to obtain the specific barcode of Aloe species and generate the corresponding DNA QR code that electronic devices could immediately recognize. This study provides innovative research methods for efficient species identification of the genus Aloe and indicates the possibility of correctly identifying, discriminating, and documenting the Aloe species.",

In this study, 189 SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in 13 language genes were scanned in 29 whole genomes from different human and primates populations. The 19 distinct SNPs in primates genomes were pointed out in several language genes including TPK1 that correlates with humans syntactic and lexical ability. PCA analysis found that LGPPs for primates were highly aggregated together but they are distant from humans LGPPs; representative human samples displayed high dispersion levels from each other in the context of LGPP. The above results may highlight a possibility that the LGPP should have more intermediate forms between human and chimpanzee-like primates.",

    "abstract": "The thermal ecology of ectotherm animals has gained considerable attention in the face of human induced climate change. Particularly in aquatic species the experimental assessment of critical thermal limits (CTmin and CTmax) may help to predict possible effects of global warming on habitat suitability and ultimately species survival. Here we present data on the thermal limits of two endemic and endangered extremophile fish species, inhabiting a geothermally-heated and sulfur-rich spring system in Southern Mexico: The sulfur molly (Poecilia sulphuraria) and the widemouth gambusia (Gambusia eurystoma). Besides physiological challenges induced by toxic hydrogen sulfide and related severe hypoxia during the day, water temperatures have been previously reported to exceed those of nearby clearwater streams. We now present temperature data for various locations and years in the sulphur spring complex and conducted laboratory thermal tolerance tests (CTmin and CTmax) both under normoxic as well as sever hypoxic conditions in both species. Average CTmax limits did not differ between species under normoxic conditions. Surprisingly P. sulphuraria was found to reach a higher critical temperature (CTmax = 43.2{degrees}C) when tested under hypoxic conditions, while G. eurystoma on average had a lower CTmax when oxygen was absent. Based on this data we calculated both species thermal safety margins and used a TDT (thermal death time) model framework to relate our experimental data to observed temperatures in the natural habitat. Our findings suggest, that both species live near their thermal limits during the annual dry season and are locally already exposed to temperatures above their critical thermal limits. We discuss these findings in the light of possible physiological adaptions of the sulfur-adapted fish species and the anthropogenic threats for this unique system.",

Using a neurodevelopmental disorder called Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf Optic Atrophy Syndrome (BBSOAS) as a genetic disease model, we applied a combined Genetic Code Expansion (GCE) and structural bioinformatics strategy to assess the pathogenic impact of several human NR2F1 variants. Nonsense mutations in the ligand binding domain (LBD) resulted in truncated proteins, while missense variants significantly affected the folding of NR2F1 monomers as well as its supramolecular complexes. The GCE-enabled covalent and site-specific capture of transient supramolecular interactions in living cells revealed the variable quaternary conformations of NR2F1 variants and pinpointed the disrupted interplay with dimeric partners and the newly identified cofactor, CRABP2, while the computational analyses of the NR2F1 structure delineated the molecular basis of the impact of the variants on the isolated and complexed structures. The revealed consequence of the pathogenic mutations on the conformation, supramolecular interplay, and alterations in the cell cycle, viability, and subcellular localization of the different variants reflect the heterogeneous disease spectrum and establish the foundation for further understanding the complexity of BBSOAS.",

    "abstract": "Deregulated metabolism is one of the hallmarks of cancer. It is well-known that tumour cells tend to metabolize glucose via glycolysis even when oxygen is available and mitochondrial respiration is functional. However, the lower energy efficiency of aerobic glycolysis with respect to mitochondrial respiration makes this behaviour, namely the Warburg effect, counter-intuitive, although it has now been recognized as a source of anabolic precursors. On the other hand, there is evidence that oxygenated tumour cells could be fuelled by exogenous lactate produced from glycolysis, and that glycolytic tumour cells export lactate to the environment. Using a multi-scale approach combining multi-agent modelling, diffusion-reaction and stoichiometric equations, we simulated these cell populations and their environment, and studied the metabolic co-operation between cells exposed to different oxygen concentration and nutrient abundance. The results show that the metabolic cooperation between cells reduces the depletion of environmental glucose, resulting in an overall advantage of using aerobic glycolysis. In addition, the environmental oxygen level was found to be decreased by the symbiosis, promoting a further shift towards anaerobic glycolysis. However, the oxygenated and hypoxic cell populations may gradually reach quasi-equilibrium. A sensitivity analysis based on Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation shows that the symbiotic dynamics depends on properties of the specific cell such as the minimum glucose level needed for glycolysis. Our results suggest that strategies that block glucose transporters may be more effective than those blocking lactate intake transporters to reduce tumour growth by blocking lactate production.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMetabolic alteration is one of the hallmarks of cancer and the well-known metabolic alteration of tumour cells is that cells prefer to do glycolysis over mitochondrial respiration even under well-oxygenated and functional mitochondrial conditions. On the other hand, there is evidence that oxygenated tumour cells could be fuelled by exogenous lactate produced from hypoxic glycolytic cells in which it can create a metabolic co-operation between oxygenated and hypoxic cell populations. This metabolic co-operation could allow tumour cells to economically share oxygen and glucose and promote tumour survival. Using a multi-scale approach combining multi-agent modelling, diffusion-reaction and stoichiometric equations, we studied this metabolic co-operation between different populations of cells, exposed to a changing microenvironment. We predict that the tumour environmental glucose depletion is decreased while the oxygen depletion is increased by this metabolic symbiosis, promoting a further shift towards glycolysis. Our results also show that blocking glucose transporters could be more effective than blocking lactate intake transporters, because the former would disrupt both glycolysis and lactate production, drastically reducing tumour growth.",

    "abstract": "We present the first complete stochastic model of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) intracellular replication. Previous models developed to capture VSVs intracellular replication have either been ODE-based or have not represented the complete replicative cycle, limiting our ability to understand the impact of the stochastic nature of early cellular infections on virion production between cells and how these dynamics change in response to mutations. Our model accurately predicts changes in mean virion production in gene-shuffled VSV variants and can capture the distribution of the number of viruses produced. This model has allowed us to enhance our understanding of intercellular variability in virion production, which appears to be influenced by the duration of the early phase of infection, and variation between variants, arising from balancing the time the genome spends in the active state, the speed of incorporating new genomes into virions, and the production of viral components. Being a stochastic model, we can also assess other effects of mutations beyond just the mean number of virions produced, including the probability of aborted infections and the standard deviation of the number of virions produced. Our model provides a biologically interpretable framework for studying the stochastic nature of VSV replication, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying variation in virion production. In the future, this model could enable the design of more complex viral phenotypes when attenuating VSV, moving beyond solely considering the mean number of virions produced.\n\nAuthor SummaryThis study presents the first complete stochastic model of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication. Our model captures the dynamic process of VSVs replication within host cells, accounting for the stochastic nature of early cellular infections and how these dynamics change in response to mutations. By accurately predicting changes in mean virion production and the distribution of viruses in gene-shuffled VSV variants, our model enhances our understanding of viral replication and the variation we see in virion production. Importantly, our findings shed light on the mechanisms underlying the production of VSV virions, revealing the influence of factors such as the duration of the early infection phase and the interplay between the genomes ability to switch into an inactive state and viral protein production. We go beyond assessing the mean number of virions produced and examine other effects of mutations, including the probability of aborted infections and the variability in virion production. This stochastic model provides a valuable framework for studying the complex nature of viral replication, contributing to our understanding of single-cell viral dynamics and variability. Ultimately, this knowledge could pave the way for designing more effective strategies to attenuate VSV.",

    "abstract": "The recent discovery of the peritrichous, swarm-competent bacterium Enterobacter sp. SM3 has offered a new opportunity to elucidate the role of swarming motility in the gut microbiome. Here we present first findings of the run-and-tumble behavior of SM3 in both a control solution of motility buffer and upon bulk exposure to the chemoattractants serine and aspartate, drawing a comparison with the well-studied behavior of E. coli. It was found that SM3 runs with an average speed of approximately 30 {micro}m/s for an average duration of 0.77 s. Tumble events occur for an average duration of 0.11 s with a 69{whitebullet} average tumble angle. Both values are similar to that of E. coli. When exposed to serine, SM3 suppresses the frequency of tumble events, which in turn increases the average run duration. In addition, the average tumble angle was found to decrease in response to serine. However, when exposed to up to a millimolar concentration of aspartate, SM3 does not demonstrate a notable change in run-and-tumble parameters. These results suggest that run-and-tumble is the characteristic swimming behavior of SM3 in its planktonic state. These findings serve as a benchmark in a quest to determine the connection among swimming, swarming, and the complex dynamics of the gut microbiome.\n\nIMPORTANCEBacteria form the largest domain of living creatures on this planet. Our interactions with bacteria influence us in many ways, not the least of which being in regards to human health. A recently identified species of gut bacteria, Enterobacter sp. SM3, has been shown to reduce intestinal inflammation, suggesting that swarming could play a physiologically beneficial role. In this report, we study the motility of individual SM3 bacteria This study is an essential step towards an overarching goal to understand the influence of bacterial motility on human health.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has become an invaluable tool for bioimage analysis but, while open-source cell annotation software such as cellpose are widely used, an equivalent tool for three-dimensional (3D) vascular annotation does not exist. With the vascular system being directly impacted by a broad range of diseases, there is significant medical interest in quantitative analysis for vascular imaging. However, existing deep learning approaches for this task are specialised to particular tissue types or imaging modalities. We present a new deep learning model for segmentation of vasculature that is generalisable across tissues, modalities, scales and pathologies. To create a generalisable model, a 3D convolutional neural network was trained using data from multiple modalities including optical imaging, computational tomography and photoacoustic imaging. Through this varied training set, the model was forced to learn common features of vessels cross-modality and scale. Following this, the general model was fine-tuned to different applications with a minimal amount of manually labelled ground truth data. It was found that the general model could be specialised to segment new datasets, with a high degree of accuracy, using as little as 0.3% of the volume of that dataset for fine-tuning. As such, this model enables users to produce accurate segmentations of 3D vascular networks without the need to label large amounts of training data.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian innate immune system uses cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) to synthesize the cyclic dinucleotide 2',3'-cGAMP during antiviral and antitumor immune responses. 2',3'-cGAMP is a nucleotide second messenger that initiates inflammatory signaling by binding to and activating the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) receptor. Bacteria also encode cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferases (CD-NTases) that produce nucleotide second messengers to initiate antiviral (antiphage) signaling. Bacterial CD-NTases produce a wide range of cyclic oligonucleotides but have not been documented to produce 2',3'-cGAMP. Here we discovered bacterial CD-NTases that produce 2',3'-cGAMP to restrict phage replication. Bacterial 2',3'-cGAMP binds to CD-NTase associated protein 14 (Cap14), a transmembrane protein of unknown function. Using electrophysiology, we show that Cap14 is a chloride-selective ion channel that is activated by 2',3'-cGAMP binding. Cap14 adopts a modular architecture, with an N-terminal transmembrane domain and a C-terminal nucleotide-binding SAVED domain. Domain-swapping experiments demonstrated the Cap14 transmembrane region could be substituted with a nuclease, thereby generating a biosensor that is selective for 2',3'-cGAMP. This study reveals that 2',3'-cGAMP signaling extends beyond metazoa to bacteria. Further, our findings suggest that transmembrane proteins of unknown function in bacterial immune pathways may broadly function as nucleotide-gated ion channels.",

    "abstract": "Clavibacter, a plant endophytic actinobacterial genus, includes phytopathogens with devasting effects on several crops. C. michiganensis, the seed-borne and causal agent of bacterial canker in tomato, is arguably the most notorious species of the genus. Yet, its origin and natural reservoirs remain elusive. Moreover, C. michiganensis populations show different genetic pathogenicity profiles with equally unpredictable plant disease outcomes. To tackle these uncertainties, here we analyze genomic data generated during a decade-long survey of Clavibacter in wild and commercial tomato cultivars, providing evolutionary insights that informed on the pathogenicity of this phytopathogen. Unexpectedly, our phylogeny situate the last common ancestor of C. michiganensis next to Clavibacter isolates from grasses rather than to the sole strain we could isolate from wild tomato, which is closer to C. capsici associated with pepper. Pathogenicity profiling of selected C. michiganensis isolates, together with C. phaseoli and C. californiensis as sister taxa of the grass clade, and the newly isolated C. capsici from wild tomato, was found to be congruent with the proposed phylogenetic relationships. Furthermore, we identified gene enrichment after an evolutionary bottleneck leading to the appearance of C. michiganesis, including known pathogenicity factors but also hitherto unnoticed genes with such potential, i.e., nutrient acquisition and specialized metabolite metabolic gene clusters. The holistic perspective provided by our long-term and in-depth analyses hints towards a host shift event as the origin of the causative agent of bacterial canker in tomato, leading to a complex of C. michiganensis with pathogenicity factors that remain to be characterized.",

Although extensive efforts have been made to develop {beta}-lactamase inhibitors, inhibitor-resistant {beta}-lactamases emerge rapidly. In addition, there are currently no clinically available inhibitors against the metallo-{beta}-lactamases, a group of {beta}-lactamases of great global concern.

We report the development of a whole-cell E. coli biosensor which can quantify {beta}-lactamase inhibition in a cellular context. Upon administration of an effective inhibitor, a {beta}-lactam is rescued from {beta}- lactamase-catalyzed degradation, resulting in the emission of a luminescent signal by the biosensor. This platform was validated using a panel of clinically relevant {beta}-lactamases and was applied to quantitatively study the potency of a selection of currently used and reported {beta}-lactamase inhibitors.

    "abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus, transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes. The CHIKV positive-sense RNA genome contains two open reading frames, coding for the non-structural (nsP) and structural proteins of the virus. The non-structural polyprotein precursor is proteolytically cleaved to generate nsP1-4. Intriguingly most isolates of CHIKV (and other alphaviruses) possess an opal stop codon close to the 3 end of the nsP3 coding sequence and translational readthrough is necessary to produce full-length nsP3 and the nsP4 RNA polymerase. Here we investigate the role of this stop codon by replacing the arginine codon with all three stop codons in the context of both a subgenomic replicon and infectious CHIKV. Both opal and amber stop codons were tolerated in mammalian cells, but the ochre was not. In mosquito cells all three stop codons were tolerated. Using SHAPE analysis we interrogated the structure of a putative stem loop 3 of the stop codon and used mutagenesis to probe the importance of a short base-paired region at the base of this structure. Our data reveal that this stem is not required for stop codon translational readthrough, and we conclude that other factors must facilitate this process to permit productive CHIKV replication.",

    "abstract": "Type II vitellogenin (Vtg2), the second most abundant type of vitellogenin in zebrafish eggs, is a major source of nutrients for early embryonic development. The main objective of this study was to determine the specific functions and essentiality of vtg2 in zebrafish early development using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool. A 2811 bp deletion on gDNA was detected in vtg2-mutant zebrafish via PCR genotyping and sequencing. Introduced mutation caused vitelline membrane deficiencies and significant mortalities of mutant offspring. Further effects on female fecundity, egg fertilization rate and vtg2 gene expression and Vtgs abundance in liver were observed in F2, while effects on embryo hatching, survival rates, proteomic profiles and abundances were observed in F3 generations of the vtg2-mutant line. No change in vtg2 transcript has been detected, however, Vtg2 abundance in F2 female liver was 5x, and in 1 hpf F3 vtg2-mutant embryos was 3.8x less than Wt (p < 0.05). All Vtgs, except Vtg7, declined in abundance in 1 hpf F3 vtg2-mutant embryos (p < 0.05). Fecundity was unaffected while fertilization rate was more than halved in F2 vtg2-mutant females (p < 0.05). Hatching rate was significantly higher in F3 vtg2-mutant embryos in comparison to Wt embryos. Survival rate declined drastically to 29 % and 18 % at 24 hpf and 20 dpf, respectively, in F3 vtg2-mutant embryos. Pericardial, yolk sac/abdominal edema and spinal lordosis were evident at later stages in the surviving F3 vtg2-mutant larvae. Overrepresentation and high expression of histones, zona pellucida proteins, lectins, and protein degradation related proteins in F3 vtg2-mutant embryos provide evidence to impaired mechanisms involved in vitellin membrane formation. Findings of this study imply a potential function of Vtg2 in acquisition of vitellin membrane integrity, among other reproductive functions, and therefore, its essentiality in early zebrafish embryo development.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYVitellogenins (Vtgs) are major yolk nutrient precursors supporting early vertebrate development. Most species have multiple forms of Vtg, but little is known about their individual roles in reproduction and it is uncertain which forms are essential for successful development or at what stage(s) of development they are required. This study employed a CRISPR/Cas9 gene knock out (KO) to assess essentiality and functionality of Vtg2 in zebrafish, in continuation to a previously published work on type I and type III vtgs KO. The findings of this study, in combination with the previous findings, present a new model of Vtg functionality. Accordingly, Vtg2 contribute to regulation of fecundity and fertilization in female reproduction while make essential contributions to embryonic morphogenesis, hatching and embryonic and larval kinetics and survival. In addition, Vtg2 is critically important to proper formation of the vitellin membrane, and thus, to embryogenesis and later development. Our novel findings provide, for the first time, empirical evidence that the Vtg2 are essential, having critical requisite functions during oogenesis and embryonic and larval development. The overall results substantiate the concept that each type of Vtg is specialized to play unique roles in reproduction and development.",

    "abstract": "Mouse models are invaluable to understanding fundamental mechanisms in vascular biology during development, in health and different disease states. Several constitutive or inducible models that selectively knockout or knock in genes in vascular endothelial cells exist; however, functional and phenotypic differences exist between macrovascular and microvascular endothelial cells in different organs. In order to study microvascular endothelial cell-specific biological processes, we developed a Tamoxifen-inducible von Willebrand Factor (vWF) Cre recombinase mouse in the SJL background. The transgene consists of the human vWF promoter with the microvascular selective 734 base pair sequence to drive Cre recombinase fused to a mutant estrogen ligand-binding domain [ERT2] that requires Tamoxifen for activity (CreERT2) followed by a polyadenylation signal. We initially observed Tamoxifen-inducible restricted bone marrow megakaryocyte and sciatic nerve microvascular endothelial cell Cre recombinase expression in offspring of mixed strain hemizygous C57BL/6-SJL founder mice bred with mT/mG reporter mice, with >90% bone marrow megakaryocyte expression efficiency. We subsequently backcrossed founder mice to the SJL background using speed congenics, and intercrossed for multiple generations to develop hemizygous Tamoxifen-inducible vWF Cre recombinase (vWF-iCre/+) SJL mice. Microvascular endothelial cell-specific Cre recombinase expression occurred in the sciatic nerves, brains, spleens, kidneys and gastrocnemius muscles of adult vWF-iCre/+ SJL mice bred with Ai14 tdTomato reporter mice, with retained low level bone marrow and splenic megakaryocyte expression. This novel mouse model would support hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies to decipher the role(s) of specific genes transcribed by microvascular endothelial cells during development, as well as in physiologic and pathophysiologic states in an organ- and time-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "The mechanosensitive PIEZO channel family has been linked to over 26 disorders and diseases. Although progress has been made in understanding these channels at the structural and functional levels, the underlying mechanisms of PIEZO-associated diseases remain elusive. In this study, we engineered four PIEZO-based disease models using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. We performed an unbiased chemical mutagen-based genetic suppressor screen to identify putative suppressors of a conserved gain-of-function variant pezo-1[R2405P] that in human PIEZO2 causes distal arthrogryposis type 5 (DA5; p. R2718P). Electrophysiological analyses indicate that pezo-1(R2405P) is a gain-of-function allele. Using genomic mapping and whole genome sequencing approaches, we identified a candidate suppressor allele in the C. elegans gene gex-3. This gene is an ortholog of human NCKAP1(NCK-associated protein 1), a subunit of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-verprolin homologous protein (WAVE/SCAR) complex, which regulates F-actin polymerization. Depletion of gex-3 by RNAi, or with the suppressor allele gex-3(av259[L353F]), significantly restored the small brood size and low ovulation rate, as well as alleviated the crushed oocyte phenotype of the pezo-1(R2405P) mutant. Auxin-inducible degradation of GEX-3 revealed that only somatic-specific degradation of GEX-3 restored the reduced brood size in the pezo-1(R2405P) mutants. Additionally, actin organization and orientation were disrupted and distorted in the pezo-1 mutants. Mutation of gex-3(L353F) partially alleviated these defects. The identification of gex-3 as a suppressor of the pathogenic variant pezo-1(R2405P) suggests that the cytoskeleton plays an important role in regulating PIEZO channel activity and provides insight into the molecular mechanisms of DA5 and other PIEZO-associated diseases.",

    "abstract": "The immune response against an invading pathogen is generally associated with collateral tissue damage caused by the immune system itself. Consequently, several resilience mechanisms have evolved to attenuate the negative impacts of immune effectors. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small, cationic peptides that contribute to innate defenses by targeting negatively charged membranes of microbes1, 2. While being protective against pathogens, AMPs can be cytotoxic to host cells1, 3. Little is known of mechanisms that protect host tissues from AMP-induced immunopathology. Here, we reveal that a family of stress-induced proteins, the Turandots4, 5, protect Drosophila host tissues from AMPs, increasing resilience to stress. Deletion of several Turandot genes increases fly susceptibility to environmental stresses due to trachea apoptosis and poor oxygen supply. Tracheal cell membranes expose high levels of phosphatidylserine, a negatively charged phospholipid, sensitizing them to the action of AMPs. Turandots are secreted from the fat body upon stress and bind to tracheal cells to protect them against AMPs. In vitro, Turandot A binds to phosphatidylserine on membranes and inhibits the pore-forming activity of Drosophila and human AMPs on eukaryotic cells without affecting their microbicidal activity. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Turandot stress proteins mitigate AMP cytotoxicity to host tissues and therefore improve their efficacy. This provides a first example of a humoral mechanism used by animals limiting host-encoded AMP collateral damages.",

    "abstract": "Currently, there is an underrepresentation of gut microbiota profiles from infants in low-middle income countries, including those residing in rural setting. This study aimed to investigate the gut microbiota composition and faecal cytokine profiles of infants in rural Cambodia. Longitudinal faecal samples collected from 32 infants with an average age of seven months were analysed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine composition of the gut microbiota, bacterial strains isolated and subjected to whole genome sequencing and genomic analysis, and concentrations of faecal cytokines were also measured. Initially, and given potential challenges of sample collection and storage in rural settings, we also tested different collection methods, and determined that faecal samples stored in DNA preservation buffer has a significantly greater abundance of Bacteroides, when compared to naive samples. Broader microbiota analysis indicated that Bifidobacterium was the most abundant genus in the infant gut with Bifidobacterium longum the most abundant species. Gut microbiota composition was associated with breastfeeding, particularly higher Bifidobacterium longum. Most infants had detectable pathogenic taxa, indicating exposure to environmental pathogens. We also determined that potentially pathogenic genera were more abundant in infants with recent diarrheal illness. Surprisingly we did not detect any significant antibiotic-associated perturbations in the gut microbiota, and no associations were found between gut microbiota and infant growth. Profiling of isolated strains indicated the ability to digest specific dietary components e.g. human milk oligosaccharides, and the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in potentially pathogenic species, as well as beneficial genera including Bifidobacterium. Faecal cytokine analysis revealed consistent differences in Interlukin-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations, suggesting breastfeedings influence on the infant gut mucosal immune system. This study offers insights into the gut microbiota composition and faecal immune profiles of rural Cambodian infants, emphasising the differences between infants from high-income countries.",

    "abstract": "During prophase I of meiosis, DNA double-strand breaks form throughout the genome, with a subset repairing as crossover events, enabling the accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division. The mechanism by which DSBs become selected to repair as crossovers is unknown, although the crossover positioning and levels in each cell indicate it is a highly regulated process. One of the proteins that localises to crossover sites is the serine/threonine cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2. Regulation of CDK2 occurs via phosphorylation at tyrosine 15 (Y15) and threonine 160 (T160) inhibiting and activating the kinase, respectively. In this study we use a combination of immunofluorescence staining on spread spermatocytes and fixed testis sections, and STA-PUT gravitational sedimentation to isolate cells at different developmental stages to further investigate the temporal phospho regulation of CDK2 during prophase I. Western blotting reveals differential levels of the two CDK2 isoforms (CDK233kDa and CDK239kDa) throughout prophase I, with inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK2 at Y15 occurring early in prophase I, localising to telomeres and diminishing as cells enter pachynema. Conversely, the activatory phosphorylation on T160 occurs later, specifically the CDK233kDa isoform, and T160 signal is detected in spermatogonia and pachytene spermatocytes, where it co-localises with the Class I crossover protein MLH3. Taken together, our data reveals intricate control of CDK2 both with regards to levels of the two CDK2 isoforms, and differential regulation via inhibitory and activatory phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "Chiral actin bundles have been shown to play an important role in cell dynamics, but our understanding of the molecular mechanisms which combine to generate chirality remains incomplete. We numerically simulate a crosslinked filopodial bundle under the actions of helical myosin motors and/or formins and examine the collective buckling and twisting of the actin bundle. We find that the myosin spinning action effectively \"braids\" the bundle, compacting it, generating buckling, and enhancing crosslinking. Stochastic fluctuations of actin polymerization rates also contribute to filament buckling and bending of the bundle. Faster turnover of transient crosslinks attenuates the buckling and enhances coiling and compaction of the bundle. Formin twisting action by itself is not effective in inducing filopodial coiling and compaction, but co-rotating formins synergize with helical motors to coil and compact the actin bundle. We discuss implications of our findings for mechanisms of cytoskeletal chirality.",

    "abstract": "Improving the spatial resolution of a fluorescence microscope has been an ongoing challenge in the imaging community. To address this challenge, a variety of approaches have been taken, ranging from instrumentation development to image post-processing. An example of the latter is deconvolution, where images are numerically deblurred based on a knowledge of the microscope point spread function. However, deconvolution can easily lead to noise-amplification artifacts. Deblurring by post-processing can also lead to negativities or fail to conserve local linearity between sample and image. We describe here a simple image deblurring algorithm based on pixel reassignment that inherently avoids such artifacts and can be applied to general microscope modalities and fluorophore types. Our algorithm helps distinguish nearby fluorophores even when these are separated by distances smaller than the conventional resolution limit, helping facilitate, for example, the application of single-molecule localization microscopy in dense samples. We demonstrate the versatility and performance of our algorithm under a variety of imaging conditions.",

    "abstract": "From smooth to buckled, nature exhibits organs of various shapes and forms. How cellular growth patterns produce smooth organ shapes like those of leaves and sepals remains unclear. Here we show that unidirectional growth and comparable stiffness across both epidermal layers of Arabidopsis sepals are essential for smoothness. We identified a mutant with ectopic ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2 (AS2) expression that exhibits buckles on the outer epidermis due to conflicting growth directions and unequal epidermal stiffnesses. Aligning growth direction and increasing stiffness restores smoothness. Furthermore, buckling generates outgrowth by influencing auxin efflux transporter protein PIN-FORMED 1 polarity, indicating buckling can initiate organogenesis. Our findings suggest that in addition to molecular cues influencing tissue mechanics, tissue mechanics can also modulate molecular signals, giving rise to well-defined shapes.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryThe keys to unlocking sepal smoothness are unidirectional growth and even stiffness; misplace them, its time to buckle up!",

    "abstract": "Mediolateral cell intercalation is a morphogenetic strategy used throughout animal development to reshape tissues. Dorsal intercalation in the C. elegans embryo involves the mediolateral intercalation of two rows of dorsal epidermal cells to create a single row that straddles the dorsal midline, and so is a simple model to study cell intercalation. Polarized protrusive activity during dorsal intercalation requires the C. elegans Rac and RhoG orthologs CED-10 and MIG-2, but how these GTPases are regulated during intercalation has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we characterize the role of the Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), TIAM-1, in regulating actin-based protrusive dynamics during dorsal intercalation. We find that TIAM-1 can promote protrusion formation through its canonical GEF function, while its N-terminal domains function to negatively regulate this activity, preventing the generation of ectopic protrusions in intercalating cells. We also show that the guidance receptor UNC-5 inhibits ectopic protrusive activity in dorsal epidermal cells, and that this effect is in part mediated via TIAM-1. These results expand the network of proteins that regulate basolateral protrusive activity during directed cell rearrangement.\n\nSummary statementTIAM-1 activates the Rac pathway to promote protrusion formation via its GEF domain, while its N-terminal domains suppress ectopic protrusions during dorsal intercalation in the C. elegans embryo.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we report the development of a tuberculosis meningitis (TBM) mouse model using the HN878 strain via the aerosol route. Three genetically different strains of mice, CB6F1, C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, were used to determine the dissemination of HN878 in the brain. The 8 x 108 CFU/ml of HN878 dose was used to infect CB6F1 mice and deposited approximately 3.8 (0.07, SD) log10 CFU in the lungs. The burden of HN878 in the brain of the control group (administered saline) after approximately 16/17 days post-infection for CB6F1, C57BL/6 and BALB/c were 4.00 (0.47 SD), 3.79 (0.27, SD) and 2.12 (0.41, SD) log10 CFU/brain, respectively. The log10 CFU/brain in the BCG vaccinated CB6F1, C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were 1.05 (0.61, SD), 2.13 (0.33, SD) and 1.42 (0.38, SD) respectively, which, if compared to the control groups, BCG vaccinated mice inhibited dissemination of HN878 in the brain by an impressive 2.94 (CB6F1), 1.66 (C57BL/6) and 0.69 (BALB/c) log10 CFU/brain reduction. In conclusion, we have established a relatively inexpensive TBM mouse model using an aerosol, a natural route of infection, which will advance research in understanding TBM dissemination to the brain, and preclinical tuberculosis vaccine/drug discovery/drug regimens against TBM.",
