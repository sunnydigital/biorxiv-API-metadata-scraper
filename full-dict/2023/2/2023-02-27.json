    "abstract": "Lung injury activates epithelial stem or progenitor cells for alveolar repair and regeneration. However, the origin and fate of injury-induced progenitors are poorly defined. Here, we report that p63-expressing progenitors emerge upon bleomycin-induced lung injury. These p63+ progenitors proliferate rapidly and differentiate into alveolar type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) cells through distinct trajectories. Dual recombinase-mediated sequential genetic lineage tracing reveals that p63+ progenitors originate from airway secretory cells and subsequently generate alveolar cells. Functionally, p63 activation is required for efficient alveolar regeneration from secretory cells. Our study identifies a secretory cell-derived p63+ progenitor that contributes to alveolar repair, indicating a potential therapeutic avenue for lung regeneration after injury.",

    "abstract": "Alveolar type 2 (AT2) and club cells are part of the stem cell niche of the lung and their differentiation is required for pulmonary homeostasis and tissue regeneration. A disturbed crosstalk between fibroblasts and epithelial cells contributes to the loss of lung structure in chronic lung diseases. Therefore, it is important to understand how fibroblasts and lung epithelial cells interact during regeneration. Here we analyzed the interaction of fibroblasts and the alveolar epithelium modelled in air-liquid interface cultures. Single-cell transcriptomics showed that co-cultivation with fibroblasts leads to increased expression of type 2 markers in pneumocytes, activation of regulons associated with maintenance of alveolar type 2 cells, and trans-differentiation of club cells towards pneumocytes. This was accompanied by an intensified transepithelial barrier. Vice versa, activation of NF{kappa}B pathways and the CEBPB regulon as well as the expression of IL-6 and other differentiation factors (e.g. FGFs) were increased in fibroblasts co-cultured with epithelial cells. Recombinant IL-6 enhanced epithelial barrier formation. Therefore, in our co-culture model, regulatory loops were identified by which lung epithelial cells mediate regeneration and differentiation of the alveolar epithelium in a cooperative manner with the mesenchymal compartment.",

    "abstract": "For correct chromosome segregation in mitosis, sister kinetochores must interact with microtubules from opposite spindle poles (biorientation). For this, aberrant kinetochore- microtubule interaction must be resolved (error correction) by Aurora B kinase. Once biorientation is formed, tension is applied across sister kinetochores, stabilizing kinetochore- microtubule interactions. The mechanism for this tension-dependent process has been debated. Here we study how localizations of Aurora B at different kinetochore sites affect the establishment and maintenance of biorientation in budding yeast. In the absence of the physiological Aurora B-INCENP recruitment mechanisms, engineered recruitment of Aurora B-INCENP to the inner kinetochore (Mif2) prior to biorientation supports the subsequent establishment of biorientation. By contrast, an engineered Aurora B-INCENP recruitment to the outer kinetochore (Ndc80) fails to support biorientation establishment. Furthermore, when the physiological Aurora B-INCENP recruitment mechanisms are present, an engineered Aurora B-INCENP recruitment to Mif2 during metaphase (after biorientation establishment) does not affect biorientation maintenance. By contrast, an engineered Aurora B-INCENP recruitment to Ndc80 during metaphase leads to disruption of biorientation, which is dependent on the kinase activity of Aurora B. Taken together, our results suggest that spatial separation of Aurora B from its outer kinetochore substrates is required to stabilize kinetochore-microtubule interaction when biorientation is formed and tension is applied on this interaction. Meanwhile, Aurora B shows dynamic turnover (or exchange) on the centromere and kinetochore during early mitosis. It has been thought that this turnover is crucial for error correction and biorientation, as it may help Aurora B reach its substrates in distance and/or may facilitate the Aurora B activation on the mitotic spindle. However, using the engineered Aurora B-INCENP recruitment to the inner kinetochore, we demonstrate that, even without such a turnover, Aurora B-INCENP can efficiently support biorientation. Altogether, our study provides important insights into how Aurora B promotes error correction and biorientation in a tension-dependent manner.",

Unless we find transformative solutions to preserve biodiversity, future generations may not be able to enjoy natures services.\n\nWe have developed a conceptual framework that establishes the links between biodiversity dynamics and abiotic change through time and space using artificial intelligence. Here, we apply this framework to a freshwater ecosystem with a known history of human impact and study 100 years of community-level biodiversity, climate change and chemical pollution trends. We apply explainable network models with multimodal learning to community-level functional biodiversity measured with multilocus metabarcoding, to establish correlations with biocides and climate change records. We observed that the freshwater community assemblage and functionality changed over time without returning to its original state, even if the lake partially recovered in recent times. Insecticides and fungicides, combined with extreme temperature events and precipitation, explained up to 90% of the functional biodiversity changes. The community-level biodiversity approach used here reliably explained freshwater ecosystem shifts. These shifts were not observed when using traditional quality indices (e.g. Trophic Diatom Index).\n\nOur study advocates the use of high throughput systemic approaches on long-term trends over species-focused ecological surveys to identify the environmental factors that cause loss of biodiversity and disrupt ecosystem functions.",

    "abstract": "A central aim of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is to estimate direct genetic effects: the causal effects on an individuals phenotype of the alleles that they carry. However, estimates of direct effects can be subject to genetic and environmental confounding, and can also absorb the  indirect genetic effects of relatives genotypes. Recently, an important development in controlling for these confounds has been the use of within-family GWASs, which, because of the randomness of Mendelian segregation within pedigrees, are often interpreted as producing unbiased estimates of direct effects. Here, we present a general theoretical analysis of the influence of confounding in standard population-based and within-family GWASs. We show that, contrary to common interpretation, family-based estimates of direct effects can be biased by genetic confounding. In humans, such biases will often be small per-locus, but can be compounded when effect size estimates are used in polygenic scores. We illustrate the influence of genetic confounding on population- and family-based estimates of direct effects using models of assortative mating, population stratification, and stabilizing selection on GWAS traits. We further show how family-based estimates of indirect genetic effects, based on comparisons of parentally transmitted and untransmitted alleles, can suffer substantial genetic confounding. In addition to known biases that can arise in family-based GWASs when interactions between family members are ignored, we show that biases can also arise from gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions when parental genotypes are not distributed identically across interacting environmental and genetic backgrounds. We conclude that, while family-based studies have placed GWAS estimation on a more rigorous footing, they carry subtle issues of interpretation that arise from confounding and interactions.",

    "abstract": "Advances in gene delivery technologies are enabling rapid progress in molecular medicine, but require precise expression of genetic cargo in desired cell types, which is predominantly achieved via a regulatory DNA sequence called a promoter; however, only a handful of cell type-specific promoters are known. Efficiently designing compact promoter sequences with a high density of regulatory information by leveraging machine learning models would therefore be broadly impactful for fundamental research and direct therapeutic applications. However, models of expression from such compact promoter sequences are lacking, despite the recent success of deep learning in modelling expression from endogenous regulatory sequences. Despite the lack of large datasets measuring promoter-driven expression in many cell types, data from a few well-studied cell types or from endogenous gene expression may provide relevant information for transfer learning, which has not yet been explored in this setting. Here, we evaluate a variety of pretraining tasks and transfer strategies for modelling cell type-specific expression from compact promoters and demonstrate the effectiveness of pretraining on existing promoter-driven expression datasets from other cell types. Our approach is broadly applicable for modelling promoter-driven expression in any data-limited cell type of interest, and will enable the use of model-based optimization techniques for promoter design for gene delivery applications.

However, the high angular resolution dMRI acquisitions capable of fitting the microstructural models needed for tractography are often time-consuming and not routinely collected clinically, restricting the scope of tractography analyses. To address this limitation, we build on recent advances in deep learning which have demonstrated that streamline propagation can be learned from dMRI directly without traditional model fitting. Specifically, we propose learning the streamline propagator from T1w MRI to facilitate arbitrary tractography analyses when dMRI is unavailable. To do so, we present a novel convolutional-recurrent neural network (CoRNN) trained in a teacher-student framework that leverages T1w MRI, associated anatomical context, and streamline memory from data acquired for the Human Connectome Project. We characterize our approach under two common tractography paradigms, WM bundle analysis and structural connectomics, and find approximately a 5-15% difference between measures computed from streamlines generated with our approach and those generated using traditional dMRI tractography. When placed in the literature, these results suggest that the accuracy of WM measures computed from T1w MRI with our method is on the level of scan-rescan dMRI variability and raise an important question: is tractography truly a microstructural phenomenon, or has dMRI merely facilitated its discovery and implementation?",

    "abstract": "Methods based on the multi-species coalescence have been widely used in phylogenetic tree estimation using genome-scale DNA sequence data to understand the underlying evolutionary relationship between the sampled species. Evolutionary processes such as hybridization, which creates new species through interbreeding between two different species, necessitate inferring a species network instead of a species tree. A species tree is strictly bifurcating and thus fails to incorporate hybridization events which require an internal node of degree three. Hence, it is crucial to decide whether a tree or network analysis should be performed given a DNA sequence data set, a decision that is based on the presence of hybrid species in the sampled species. Although many methods have been proposed for hybridization detection, it is rare to find a technique that does so globally while considering a data generation mechanism that allows both hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting. In this paper, we consider hybridization and coalescence in a unified framework and propose a new test that can detect whether there are any hybrid species in a given set of species. We propose that based on this global test of hybridization, one can decide whether a tree or network analysis is appropriate for a given data set.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of protein binding residues (PBRs) from sequence is important for the understanding of cellular activity and helpful for the design of novel drug. However, experimental methods are time-consuming and expensive. In recent years, a lot of computational predictors based on machine learning and deep learning models are proposed to reduce such consumption. But those methods often use MSA tools such as PSI-BLAST or NetSurfP to generate some statistical features and enter them into predictive models as necessary supplementary input. The input generation process normally takes long time, and there is no standard to specify which and how many statistic results should be provided to a prediction model. In addition, prediction of PBRs relies on residue local context, but the most appropriate scale is undetermined. Most works pre-selected certain residue features as input and a scale size based on expertise for certain type of PBRs. In this study, we propose a general tool-free end-to-end framework that can be applied to all types of PBRs, Multi-scale Protein Binding Residues Prediction using language model (MsPBRsP). We adopt a pre-trained language model ProtTrans to save the large consumption caused by MSA tools, and use protein sequence alone as input to our model. To ease scale size uncertainty, we construct multi-size windows in attention layer and multi-size kernels in convolutional layer. We test our framework on various benchmark datasets including PBRs from protein-protein, protein-nucleotide, protein-small ligand, heterodimer, homodimer and antibody-antigen interactions. Compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, MsPBRsP achieves superior performance with less running time and higher prediction rates on every PBRs prediction task. Specifically, we boost F1 score by 27.1% and AUPRC score by 7.6% on NSP448 dataset and decrease running time from over 10 minutes to under 0.1s on average.

These include the capability to oxidize the mixed-linked {beta}-1[-&gt;]3/{beta}-1[-&gt;]4-glucans (MLGs), recently described as cell wall-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that activate plant immunity. The two paralogous genes show a different expression profile. Unlike CELLOX1, CELLOX2 is not expressed in seedlings or in adult plants and is not involved in immunity against Botrytis cinerea. Both genes are expressed in a concerted manner in the seed coat during development: whereas CELLOX2 transcripts are detected mainly during the heart stage, CELLOX1 transcripts are detected later, when the expression of CELLOX2 decreases. Analysis of seeds of cellox1 and cellox2 knock-out mutants show alterations in the structure of the coat and mucilage, but not in their monosaccharide composition. We propose that the cell wall structure of specific organs is not only the result of a coordinated synthesis/degradation of polysaccharides but also of their exposure to enzymatic oxidation. Our results also reinforce the view that the family of BBE-l proteins is at least in part devoted to the control of the activity of cell wall-derived oligosaccharides acting as DAMPs.\n\nSENTENCETwo Arabidopsis BBE-like oxidases of the cell wall DAMPs cellodextrins and mixed-linked {beta}-glucans inactivate their elicitor activity.

    "abstract": "Activation of CD8+ T cells against pathogens and cancers involves the recognition of antigenic peptides bound to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class-I proteins. Peptide binding to HLA class I proteins is coordinated by a multi-protein complex called the peptide loading complex (PLC). Tapasin, a key PLC component, facilitates the binding and optimization of HLA class I peptides. However, different HLA class I allotypes have variable requirements for tapasin for their assembly and surface expression. HLA-B*44:02 and HLA-B*44:05, which differ only at residue 116 of their heavy chain sequences, fall at opposite ends of the tapasin-dependency spectrum. HLA-B*44:02 (D116) is highly tapasin-dependent, whereas HLA-B*44:05 (Y116) is highly tapasinindependent. Mass spectrometric comparisons of HLA-B*4405 and HLA-B*44:02 peptidomes were undertaken to better understand the influences of tapasin upon HLA-B44 peptidome compositions. Analyses of the HLA-B*44:05 peptidomes in the presence and absence of tapasin reveal that peptides with the C-terminal tryptophan residues and those with higher predicted binding affinities are selected in the presence of tapasin. Additionally, when tapasin is present, C-terminal tryptophans are also more highly represented among peptides unique to B*44:02 and those shared between B*44:02 and B*44:05, compared with peptides unique to B*44:05. Overall, our findings demonstrate that tapasin influences the C-terminal composition of HLA class I-bound peptides and favors the binding of higher affinity peptides. For the HLA-B44 family, the presence of tapasin or high tapasin-dependence of an allotype results in better binding of peptides with C-terminal tryptophans, consistent with a role for tapasin in stabilizing an open conformation to accommodate bulky C-terminal residues.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have been conducted on endophytic bacteria of vanilla. In this study, 58 bacterial strains were isolated from two hybrid vanilla plants from Madagascar, Manitra ampotony and Tsy taitra. They were genetically characterised and divided into four distinct phylotypes. A selection of twelve strains corresponding to the identified genetic diversity were tested in vitro for four phytobeneficial capacities: phosphate solubilisation, free nitrogen fixation, phytohormone and siderophore production. They were also evaluated in vitro for their ability to biocontrol the growth of the vanilla pathogenic fungi, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis vanillae and Cholletotrichum orchidophilum. Bacteria belonging to three different phyla were found to be highly competent in each of the phytobeneficial capacities tested. Bacteria belonging to the phylum related to Bacillus siamensis showed the best capacity to inhibit fungal growth making them good candidates for controlling fungal diseases of vanilla. This competence was highlighted with spectral imaging showing the production of lipopeptides by the bacterial strains confronted with the pathogenic fungi of vanilla.",

    "abstract": "Early structural studies of chromosome organisation in eukaryotic nuclei led to the identification of euchromatin and heterochromatin, two main archetypes of chromatin visible through microscopy. Subsequently, the diversity of chromatin composition along the linear genome sequence was resolved using high throughput sequencing techniques to map a multitude of chromatin marks and unravel their functional organisation. Recent analyses of human chromosome conformation capture experiments tend to point to the existence of several chromosome sub-compartments that may correspond to epigenomic variations in chromatin composition. Here, we compare genome 3D organisations in representative eukaryotic species to explore the links between chromosomal sub-compartments and chromatin marks, genome replication timing, and genomic repeats in six model organisms, including vertebrates, plants and insects. We report that the 3D organisation of chromatin in organisms with different genome content and size can be described as layers characterised by distinct chromatin marks and activities. We propose a \"layer cake\" model for the genome 3D organisation as a more refined view than the prevalent \"two compartments\" model of chromatin organisation in multi-cellular organisms.",

Local morphogen concentration governs cell differentiation through gene regulatory networks (GRN). Previous inference methodologies tackle intercellular GRN inference between cells of one type. This is insufficient, as many developmental systems consist of cells of different types interacting with each other. Inference methodologies of GRNs between different cell types assume knowledge of diffusible morphogen identity and concentration. This makes their applicability limited in real biological systems. Here, we develop a computational methodology to infer the intercellular GRN derived from experiments that use fluorescence from reporter proteins for gene expression measurements. For validation, we demonstrate the methodology in silico using three case studies based on developmental and synthetic biology. The results show that, barring practical identifiability limitations, the methodology successfully infers the intercellular GRNs.",

    "abstract": "Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surface-based morphometry (SBM) are two widely used neuroimaging techniques for investigating brain anatomy. These techniques rely on statistical inferences at individual points (voxels or vertices), clusters of points, or a priori regions-of-interest. They are powerful tools for describing brain anatomy, but offer little insights into the generative processes that shape a particular set of findings. Moreover, they are restricted to a single spatial resolution scale, precluding the opportunity to distinguish anatomical variations that are expressed across multiple scales. Drawing on concepts from classical physics, here we develop an approach, called mode-based morphometry (MBM), that can describe any empirical map of anatomical variations in terms of the fundamental, resonant modes--eigenmodes--of brain anatomy, each tied to a specific spatial scale. Hence, MBM naturally yields a multiscale characterization of the empirical map, affording new opportunities for investigating the spatial frequency content of neuroanatomical variability. Using simulated and empirical data, we show that the validity and reliability of MBM are either comparable or superior to classical vertex-based SBM for capturing differences in cortical thickness maps between two experimental groups. Our approach thus offers a robust, accurate, and informative method for characterizing empirical maps of neuroanatomical variability that can be directly linked to a generative physical process.",

    "abstract": "The composition of the vaginal microbiota is heavily influenced by pregnancy and may factor into pregnancy complications, including spontaneous preterm birth. However, results among studies have been inconsistent, due in part to variation in sample sizes and ethnicity. Thus an association between the vaginal microbiota and preterm labor continues to be debated. Yet, before assessing associations between the composition of the vaginal microbiota and preterm labor, a robust and in-depth characterization of the vaginal microbiota throughout pregnancy in the specific study population under investigation is required. Herein, we report a large longitudinal study (N = 474 women, 1862 vaginal samples) of a primarily African-American cohort- which experiences a relatively high rate of pregnancy complications - evaluating associations between individual identity, gestational age, and other maternal characteristics with the composition of the vaginal microbiota throughout gestation resulting in term delivery. The primary factors influencing the composition of the vaginal microbiota in pregnancy are individual identity and gestational age at sampling. Secondary factors are maternal age, parity, obesity, and self-reported Cannabis use. The principal pattern across gestation is for the vaginal microbiota to remain or transition to a state of Lactobacillus dominance. This pattern can be mitigated by maternal parity and obesity. Regardless, network analyses reveal dynamic associations among specific bacterial taxa within the vaginal ecosystem, which shift throughout the course of pregnancy. This study provides a robust foundational understanding of the vaginal microbiota in pregnancy among African-Americans, in particular, and sets the stage for further investigation of this microbiota in obstetrical disease.\n\nIMPORTANCEThere is debate regarding links between the vaginal microbiota and pregnancy complications, especially spontaneous preterm birth. Inconsistencies in results among studies are likely due to differences in sample sizes and cohort ethnicity. Ethnicity is a complicating factor because, although all bacterial taxa commonly inhabiting the vagina are present among all ethnicities, the frequencies of these taxa vary among ethnicities. Therefore, an in-depth characterization of the vaginal microbiota throughout pregnancy in the specific study population under investigation is required prior to evaluating associations between the vaginal microbiota and obstetrical disease. This initial investigation is a large longitudinal study of the vaginal microbiota throughout gestation resulting in a term delivery in a primarily African-American cohort, a population that experiences disproportionally negative maternal-fetal health outcomes. It establishes the magnitude of associations between maternal characteristics, such as age, parity, BMI, and self-reported Cannabis use, on the vaginal microbiota in pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Recent metagenome assembled genome (MAG) analyses have profoundly impacted Rickettsiology systematics. Discovery of basal lineages (Mitibacteraceae and Athabascaceae) with predicted extracellular lifestyles reveals an evolutionary timepoint for the transition to host dependency, which occurred independent of mitochondrial evolution. Notably, these basal rickettsiae carry the Rickettsiales vir homolog (rvh) type IV secretion system (T4SS) and purportedly use rvh to kill congener microbes rather than parasitize host cells as described for derived rickettsial pathogens. MAG analysis also substantially increased diversity for genus Rickettsia and delineated a basal lineage (Tisiphia) that stands to inform on the rise of human pathogens from protist and invertebrate endosymbionts. Herein, we probed Rickettsiales MAG and genomic diversity for the distribution of Rickettsia rvh effectors to ascertain their origins. A sparse distribution of most Rickettsia rvh effectors outside of Rickettsiaceae lineages indicates unique rvh evolution from basal extracellular species and other rickettsial families. Remarkably, nearly every effector was found in multiple divergent forms with variable architectures, illuminating profound roles for gene duplication and recombination in shaping effector repertoires in Rickettsia pathogens. Lateral gene transfer plays a prominent role shaping the rvh effector landscape, as evinced by the discover of many effectors on plasmids and conjugative transposons, as well as pervasive effector gene exchange between Rickettsia and Legionella species. Our study exemplifies how MAGs can provide incredible insight on the origins of pathogen effectors and how their architectural modifications become tailored to eukaryotic host cell biology.",

The keystone taxa identified by network analysis are generally considered to play a vital role in the structure and function of microbial communities, but there is no uniformly accepted operational definition of such taxa. Further, what species and how they affect the communitys stability and function are still poorly understood.\n\nMethodsTo solve this problem, we performed a large-scale network analysis of the microbial communities residing in 1186 activated sludge (AS) samples.\n\nResultsWe found that the AS co-occurrence network is a typical scale-free network. While most taxa in the AS co-occurrence network have little association, there are still a small number of taxa that are strongly interconnected. We defined a group of keystone taxa that have an important impact on network stability. Further analysis results indicate that the communities harboring the keystone taxa maintain higher stability, but these communities possess lower pollutant removal rates. In addition, we found that keystone taxa were more likely to appear in samples with lower sludge load.\n\nConclusionsOur work identified the keystone taxa that maintain the stability of microbial communities in the AS systems but at the cost of reducing their function. This finding shed light on the relationship between composition, stability, and function within microbial communities. It also provides novel insights into manipulating the function of microbial communities by modifying their composition.",

For example, microbial ecosystems can collapse by the decline of a strain that provides an essential resource on which other strains cross-feed. Here, we show that tipping points, ecosystem collapse, bistability and hysteresis arise even with very weak (non-obligate) mutualism provided the population is spatially structured. Based on numeric solutions of a metacommunity model and mean-field analyses, we demonstrate that weak mutualism lowers the minimal dispersal rate necessary to avoid stochastic extinction, while species need to overcome a mean threshold density to survive in this low dispersal rate regime. Moreover, we show that, starting with a randomly interacting species pool, metapopulation structure tends to select for an ecosystem with mutualistic interactions. Bistable metacommunities could, therefore, be a natural outcome of evolutionary dynamics in structured ecosystems.",

Prostate cancer is the second most common male cancer in western industrialized countries. Prior studies of primary prostate cancer tumor genetics revealed extensive inter and intra-patient tumor heterogeneity. Recent advances have enabled extensive single-cell and spatial transcriptomic profiling of tissue specimens. The ability to resolve accurate prostate cancer tumor phylogenies at high spatial resolution would provide tools to address questions in tumorigenesis, disease progression, and metastasis. Recent advances in machine learning have enabled the inference of ground-truth genomic single-nucleotide and copy number variant status from transcript data. The inferred SNV and CNV states can be used to resolve clonal phylogenies, however, it is still unknown how faithfully transcript-based tumor phylogenies reconstruct ground truth DNA-based tumor phylogenies. We sought to study the accuracy of inferred-transcript to recapitulate DNA-based tumor phylogenies.\n\nWe first performed in-silico comparisons of inferred and directly resolved SNV and CNV status, from single cancer cells, from three different cell lines. We found that inferred SNV phylogenies accurately recapitulate DNA phylogenies (entanglement = 0.097). We observed similar results in iCNV and CNV based phylogenies (entanglement = 0.11). Analysis of published prostate cancer DNA phylogenies and inferred CNV, SNV and transcript based phylogenies demonstrated phylogenetic concordance. Finally, a comparison of pseudo-bulked spatial transcriptomic data to adjacent sections with WGS data also demonstrated recapitulation of ground truth (entanglement = 0.35). These results suggest that transcript-based inferred phylogenies recapitulate conventional genomic phylogenies.

Therefore, we considered three pivotal production traits of rice bean; flowering, maturity and seed weight, to identify associated candidate genes. One-hundred diverse genotypes out of 1800 evaluated rice bean accessions from the Indian National Genebank were considered for phenotypic data collection and genotyping by transcriptome sequencing approach. Association analysis involving various GWAS models was conducted to identify significant marker-trait associations. The results revealed association of 82 markers on 48 transcripts for flowering, 26 markers on 22 transcripts for maturity and 22 markers on 21 transcripts for seed weight. The annotation of associated transcripts unraveled the functional genes related to the considered traits. Among the significant candidate genes identified, HSC80, P-II PsbX, phospholipid-transporting-ATPase-9, pectin-acetylesterase-8 and E3-ubiquitin-protein-ligase-RHG1A were found associated with flowering. Further, associations of WRKY1 and DEAD-box-RH27 with seed weight, PIF3 and pentatricopeptide-repeat-containing-gene with maturity & seed weight and aldo-keto-reductase with flowering & maturity have been revealed. The present investigation provides insights into the genetic mechanisms governing economically-essential traits like flowering, maturity and seed weight that can be potentially utilized for rice bean improvement.\n\nHighlightsThe present investigation is the first associative transcriptomics approach implemented on Vigna umbellata. Based on the marker-trait association analysis, candidate genes for flowering, maturity and seed weight traits are reported.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesGenerativity is the desire and actions to improve the well-being of younger generations. Generativity is associated with purpose in life, with both being shown to independently improve cognition in older adults. Our aims were to identify the neural substrates supporting generativity and determine the mechanism underlying the relationship between generativity and purpose in life in older adults.\n\nMethodForty-three older adults (Mage = 70.33, 79.1% female) at risk for Alzheimers disease underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and completed questionnaires assessing generativity, social support, and purpose in life. Seed-to-voxel analyses examined if resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and ventral striatum, key nodes at the intersection of subjective valuation and self-transcendence, were associated with generativity. Moderated mediation models examined if social support or rsFC mediated or moderated the association between generativity and purpose in life, respectively.\n\nResultsGenerative desire was associated with enhanced rsFC between the vmPFC and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rdlPFC). Affectionate social support fully mediated the relationship between generative desire and purpose in life, and rsFC between the vmPFC and rdlPFC significantly moderated this association.\n\nDiscussionThis study is the first to examine the rsFC underlying generativity and provides mechanistic insight into how purpose in life is enhanced through generative desire. Generative desire is supported by rsFC implicated in value-based social decision making and is associated with purpose in life through enhanced love and affection from others. This knowledge contributes to future developments of personalized interventions that promote resilience in at-risk aging.",

The clinical manifestations of Lyme disease vary based on the genospecies of the infecting Borrelia burgdorferi spirochete, but the microbial genetic elements underlying these associations are not known. Here, we report the whole genome sequence (WGS) and analysis of 299 patient-derived B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (Bbss) isolates from patients in the Eastern and Midwestern US and Central Europe. We develop a WGS-based classification of Bbss isolates, confirm and extend the findings of previous single- and multi-locus typing systems, define the plasmid profiles of human-infectious Bbss isolates, annotate the core and strain-variable surface lipoproteome, and identify loci associated with disseminated infection. A core genome consisting of [~]800 open reading frames and a core set of plasmids consisting of lp17, lp25, lp36, lp28-3, lp28-4, lp54, and cp26 are found in nearly all isolates. Strain-variable (accessory) plasmids and genes correlate strongly with phylogeny. Using genetic association study methods, we identify an accessory genome signature associated with dissemination and define the individual plasmids and genes that make up this signature. Strains within the RST1/WGS A subgroup, particularly a subset marked by the OspC type A genotype, are associated with increased rates of dissemination. OspC type A strains possess a unique constellation of strongly linked genetic changes including the presence of lp56 and lp28-1 plasmids and a cluster of genes that may contribute to their enhanced virulence compared to other genotypes. The patterns of OspC type A strains typify a broader paradigm across Bbss isolates, in which genetic structure is defined by correlated groups of strain-variable genes located predominantly on plasmids, particularly for expression of surface-exposed lipoproteins. These clusters of genes are inherited in blocks through strain-specific patterns of plasmid occupancy and are associated with the probability of invasive infection.",

We identified vaccinia A47L as a homolog of gasdermins, the executioners of pyroptosis. An X-ray crystal structure of A47 confirmed this homology and cell-based assays revealed that A47 inhibits pyroptosis. We also identified vaccinia C1L as the product of a cryptic gene fusion event coupling a Bcl-2 related fold with a pyrin domain. C1 associates with components of the inflammasome, a cytosolic innate immune sensor involved in pyroptosis, yet paradoxically enhances inflammasome activity, suggesting a benefit to poxvirus replication in some circumstances.

Our lab uses a preclinical model of traumatic stress using predator odor (i.e., bobcat urine) in which some but not all rats exhibit persistent avoidance of odor-paired stimuli, similar to what is seen in humans. Bobcat urine exposure increases alcohol consumption in male Avoider rats, but it has not been tested for its effects on intake of other drugs. Here, we tested the effect of bobcat urine exposure on cocaine self-administration in adult male and female Wistar rats. We did not observe any effect of bobcat urine exposure on cocaine self-administration in male or female rats. We observed that (1) female rats with long access (6 hours) to cocaine self-administer more cocaine than long-access males, (2) long-access males and females exhibit escalation of cocaine intake over time, (3) stressed rats gain less weight than unstressed rats following acute predator odor exposure, (4) baseline cocaine self-administration is predictive of subsequent cocaine self-administration.

Cut190 is a cutinase from a thermophilic actinomycete and shows PET-degrading activity and high thermal stability. We developed a series of Cut190 mutants exhibiting further improvements in thermal stability and activity, and showed that the unique stabilization and activation mechanism was dependent on Ca2+ ions. Two of these mutants, Cut190** and Cut190*SS, differed from the previous mutant Cut190* by deletion of the three C-terminal residues and introduction of five substitutions, including two cysteines forming a disulfide-bond, respectively. These mutants exhibit higher thermal stability and activity, which are often mutually exclusive characteristics. Crystallographic studies of these mutants and their inactivated derivatives demonstrated that they could have a novel ejecting form that would be responsible for releasing products. We also determined the crystal structures of ligand-bound complexes, which revealed the molecular mechanisms of the aromatic-ring recognition and the tetrahedral intermediate during the substrate cleaving, although the ligands had no aromatic ring but a cyclic group. This structural information provides insights into the mechanism of the Ca2+ -dependent PET-cleaving activity of Cut190 and provides a useful basis for further mutant design and computational studies.",

    "abstract": "The polyextremophilic Cyanidiales are eukaryotic red microalgae with promising biotechnological properties arising from their low pH and elevated temperature requirements which can minimize culture contamination at scale. Cyanidioschyzon merolae 10D is a cell wall deficient species with a fully sequenced genome that is amenable to nuclear transgene integration by targeted homologous recombination. C. merolae maintains a minimal carotenoid profile and here, we sought to determine its capacity for ketocarotenoid accumulation mediated by heterologous expression of a green algal {beta}-carotene ketolase (BKT) and hydroxylase (CHYB). To achieve this, a synthetic transgene expression cassette system was built to integrate and express Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr) sourced enzymes by fusing native C. merolae transcription, translation and chloroplast targeting signals to codon-optimized coding sequences. Chloramphenicol resistance was used to select for the integration of synthetic linear DNAs into a neutral site within the host genome. CrBKT expression caused accumulation of canthaxanthin and adonirubin as major carotenoids while co-expression of CrBKT with CrCHYB generated astaxanthin as the major carotenoid in C. merolae. Unlike green algae and plants, ketocarotenoid accumulation in C. merolae did not reduce total carotenoid contents, but chlorophyll a reduction was observed. Light intensity affected global ratios of all pigments but not individual pigment compositions and phycocyanin contents were not markedly different between parental strain and transformants. Continuous illumination was found to encourage biomass accumulation and all strains could be cultivated in simulated summer conditions from two different extreme desert environments. Our findings present the first example of carotenoid metabolic engineering in a red eukaryotic microalga and open the possibility for use of C. merolae 10D for simultaneous production of phycocyanin and ketocarotenoid pigments.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=71 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/530181v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dd010dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1700e5corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bee8eaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ad67da_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "With the growing interest in using phages to combat antimicrobial resistance, computational methods for predicting phage-host interactions have been explored to help shortlist candidate phages. Most existing models consider entire proteomes and rely on manual feature engineering, which poses difficulty in selecting the most informative sequence properties to serve as input to the model. In this paper, we framed phage-host interaction prediction as a multiclass classification problem, which takes as input the embeddings of a phages receptor-binding proteins, which are known to be the key machinery for host recognition, and predicts the host genus. We explored different protein language models to automatically encode these protein sequences into dense embeddings without the need for additional alignment or structural information. We show that the use of embeddings of receptor-binding proteins presents improvements over handcrafted genomic and protein sequence features. The highest performance was obtained using the transformer-based protein language model ProtT5, resulting in a 3% to 4% increase of weighted F1 scores across different prediction confidence threshold,compared to using selected handcrafted sequence features.\n\nAuthor summaryAntimicrobial resistance is among the major global health issues at present. As alternatives to the usual antibiotics, drug formulations based on phages (bacteria-infecting viruses) have received increased interest, as phages are known to attack only a narrow range of bacterial hosts and antagonize the target pathogen with minimal side effects. The screening of candidate phages has recently been facilitated through the use of machine learning models for inferring phage-host pairs. The performance of these models relies heavily on the transformation of raw biological sequences into a collection of numerical features. However, since a wide array of potentially informative features can be extracted from sequences, selecting the most relevant ones is challenging. Our approach eliminates the need for this manual feature engineering by employing protein language models to automatically generate numerical representations for specific subsets of tail proteins known as receptor-binding proteins. These proteins are responsible for a phages initial contact with the host bacterium and are thus regarded as important determinants of host specificity. Our results show that this approach presents improvements over using handcrafted genomic and protein sequence features in predicting phage-host interaction.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of new drugs for the treatment of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) is hampered by the lack of financial reward associated with their development. A combination of exploratory data analysis, machine learning (ML) and molecular docking studies were used to evaluate 58 anti-infective agents to identify those with the potential to be repurposed for the management of onchocerciasis, an NTD. Out of the 58 test drugs, 14 were predicted by at least five ML models to be useful in managing onchocerciasis. Molecular docking studies using glycine receptor subunit -3, gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit {beta}-3 and glutamate-gated chloride channel of the 14 drugs showed binding affinities comparable to that of doramectin and pyrvinium which are known onchocerciasis drugs. Diminazine, trimetinib, triclabendazole, cridanimod, vandetinib and trametinib were the top agents showing high binding affinities from the molecular docking studies. The binding affinities of diminazine and cridanimod are similar to doramectin and pyrvinium which have demonstrated activity against onchocerciasis. The outcome of this study shows the potential of using these 14 drugs to manage onchocerciasis.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=64 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/530155v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (13K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10887dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@170e766org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16819e0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17b0279_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Mutations in it enhanced ectopic xylem formation in Vascular cell Induction culture System Using Arabidopsis Leaves (VISUAL) and enhanced graft formation and was thus named ENHANCER OF VISUAL AND GRAFTING 1 (EVG1). Mutated evg1 inhibited cambium development and callus formation yet promoted tissue attachment, syncytium size, phloem reconnection and xylem formation. evg1 affected abscisic acid and cell wall responses and was itself down regulated by ABA. We found mutations in a receptor-like gene, RLP44, had the same regeneration phenotype as EVG1 mutations including enhancing VISUAL and grafting. evg1 and rlp44 mutants affected the expression of many genes in common including those important for successful regeneration and vascular formation. We propose that EVG1 integrates information from cutting, wounding or parasitism stresses and functions with RLP44 to suppress vascular differentiation during regeneration.",

    "abstract": "The pleasurable urge to move to music (PLUMM) elicits activity in motor and reward areas of the brain and is thought to be driven by predictive processes. Dopamine within motor and limbic cortico-striatal networks is implicated in the predictive processes underlying beat-based timing and music-induced pleasure, respectively. This suggests a central role of cortico-striatal dopamine in PLUMM. This study tested this hypothesis by comparing PLUMM in Parkinsons disease patients, healthy age-matched, and young controls. Participants listened to musical sequences with varying rhythmic and harmonic complexity (low, medium, high), and rated their experienced pleasure and urge to move to the rhythm. In line with previous results, healthy younger participants showed an inverted U-shaped relation between rhythmic complexity and ratings, with a preference for medium complexity rhythms, while age-matched controls showed a similar, but weaker, inverted U-shaped response. Conversely, PD patients showed a significantly flattened response for both the urge to move and pleasure. Crucially, this flattened response could not be attributed to differences in rhythm discrimination and did not reflect an overall decrease in ratings. Together, these results support the role of dopamine within cortico-striatal networks in the predictive processes that form the link between the perceptual processing of rhythmic patterns, and the affective and motor responses to rhythmic music.",

    "abstract": "Severe stress can produce multiple persistent changes in defensive behavior. While much is known about the circuits supporting stress-induced associative fear responses, how circuit plasticity supports the broader changes in defensive behavior observed after severe stress remains unclear. Here, we find that stress-induced plasticity in the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) support doubly dissociable defensive behavioral changes. Stress-induced protein synthesis in the BLA was found to support lasting enhancements in stress sensitivity but not enhancements in exploratory anxiety-related behaviors, whereas protein synthesis in the vHC was found to support enhancements in anxiety-related behavior but not enhancements in stress sensitivity. Like protein synthesis, neuronal activity of the BLA and vHC were found to differentially support the expression of these same defensive behaviors. Lastly, blockade of associative fear had no impact on stress-induced changes in anxiety-related behavior. These findings highlight that multiple memory-systems support stress-induced defensive behavior changes.",

    "abstract": "Current treatments of Parkinsons disease (PD) have limited efficacy in alleviating axial symptoms, such as freezing of gait (FoG). In this context, concomitant deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) has been suggested as a potential therapeutic approach. However, the mechanism underlying this paired stimulation approach is unknown. The hypothetical rationale behind it relies on network-based hypotheses of intensified disinhibition of brainstem locomotor areas to facilitate the release of gait motor programs. However, to date, it is unclear how simultaneous high-frequency DBS in two different interconnected basal ganglia nuclei affect large-scale cortico-subcortical network activity. Here, we use a basic model of neural excitation, the susceptible-excited-refractory (SER) model, to compare the effects of different stimulation modes on the cortico-subcortical network underlying FoG. We develop a new network-based computational framework to uncover the most effective subcortical DBS target sites and their combinations through exhaustive analysis of the brain attractor dynamics in the healthy, PD and DBS states. We demonstrate the validity of the approach and the superior performance of combined STN+SNr DBS in the normalization of spike propagation flow in the FoG network. The present framework aims to move towards a better mechanistic understanding of the brain network effects of DBS and may be applicable to further perturbation-based therapies of brain disorders.\n\nAuthor summaryParkinsons disease patients with freezing of gait may be treated by deep brain stimulation, which has local as well as long-range effects that are mediated by brain networks. Currently, the approach of combined DBS of the subthalamic nucleus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata is investigated for being especially beneficial for patients with axial symptoms, but the exact mechanisms for this effect remain unknown. Here, we present a network-based computational framework using a basic excitable model that enables us to simulate the complete activity patterns of the brain network involved in FoG. These simulations unravel the mechanisms behind STN+SNr DBS and its efficacy in alleviating FoG. The proposed framework can capture the influence of the DBS target sites on cortico-subcortical networks and help to identify suitable stimulation target regions.",

    "abstract": "Administration or consumption of classic psychedelics (CPs) leads to profound changes in experience which are often described as highly novel and meaningful. They have shown substantial promise in treating depressive symptoms and may be therapeutic in other situations. Although research suggests that the therapeutic response is correlated with the intensity of the experience, the neural circuit basis for the alterations in experience caused by CPs requires further study. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), where CPs have been shown to induce rapid, 5-HT2A receptor-dependent structural and neurophysiological changes, is believed to be a key site of action. To investigate the acute neural circuit changes induced by CPs, we recorded single neurons and local field potentials in the mPFC of freely behaving mice after administration of the 5-HT2A/2C receptor-selective CP, 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI). We segregated recordings into active and rest periods in order to examine cortical activity during desynchronized (active) and synchronized (rest) states. We found that DOI induced a robust decrease in low frequency power and decoupled rhythmic activity from neural population dynamics when animals were at rest, attenuating the usual synchronization that occurs during less active behavioral states. DOI also increased broadband gamma power and suppressed activity in fast-spiking neurons in both active and rest periods. Together, these results show that the CP DOI induces persistent desynchronization in mPFC, including during rest when mPFC typically exhibits more synchronized activity. This shift in cortical dynamics may in part underlie the longer-lasting effects of CPs on plasticity, and may be critical to their therapeutic properties.",

    "abstract": "Odor perception is the impetus for important animal behaviors, most obviously for feeding but also for mating and communication. There are two predominate modes of odor processing: odors pass through the front of the nose (orthonasal) while inhaling and sniffing, or through the rear (retronasal) during exhalation and while eating. Despite the importance of olfaction for an animals well-being and specifically that ortho and retro naturally occur, it is unknown how the modality (ortho versus retro) is even transmitted to cortical brain regions, which could significantly affect how odors are processed and perceived. Using multi-electrode array recordings in anesthetized rats, we show that mitral cells in rat olfactory bulb reliably transmit ortho versus retronasal modality with ethyl butyrate, a common food odor. Drug manipulations affecting GABAA that control synaptic inhibition lead to worse decoding of ortho versus retro, independent of whether overall inhibition increases or decreases, suggesting that the olfactory bulb circuit may naturally favor encoding this important aspect of odors. Detailed data analysis paired with a firing rate model that captures population trends in spiking statistics shows how this circuit can encode odor modality. We have not only demonstrated that ortho/retro information is encoded to downstream brain regions, but models and analyses reveal network dynamics that promotes this encoding.\n\nNew and NoteworthyWhether ortho (sniffing odors) versus retro (exhalation and eating) is encoded from the olfactory bulb to other brain areas is not completely known. Using multi-electrode array recordings in anesthetized rats, we show that the olfactory bulb transmits this information downstream via spikes. Altering inhibition degrades ortho/retro information on average. We use theory and computation to explain our results, which should have implications on cortical processing considering that only food odors occur retronasally.",

Phenotypes induced by Wolbachia have been studied for decades and range from sperm-egg incompatibility to male killing. How Wolbachia alters host biology is less well understood. Previously, we characterized the first Wolbachia effector - WalE1, which encodes a synuclein domain at the N terminus. Purified WalE1 sediments with and bundles actin and when heterologously expressed in flies, increases Wolbachia titer in the developing oocyte. In this work, we first identify the native expression WalE1 by Wolbachia infecting both fly cells and whole animals. WalE1 appears as aggregates, separate from Wolbachia cells. We next show that WalE1 co-immunoprecipitates with the host protein Past1 and that WalE1 manipulates host endocytosis. Yeast expressing WalE1 show deficiency in uptake of FM4-64 dye, and flies harboring mutations in Past1 or overexpressing WalE1 are sensitive to AgNO3, a hallmark of endocytosis defects. Finally, we also show that Past1 null flies harbor more Wolbachia overall and in late egg chambers. Our results identify interactions between a Wolbachia secreted effector and a host protein and point to yet another important host cell process impinged upon by Wolbachia.",

    "abstract": "The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration calls for upscaling restoration efforts, but many terrestrial restoration projects are constrained by seed availability. To overcome these constraints, wild plants are increasingly propagated on farms to produce seeds for restoration projects. During on-farm propagation, the plants face non-natural conditions with different selection pressures, and they might evolve adaptations to cultivation that parallel those of agricultural crops, which could be detrimental to restoration efforts. To test this, we compared traits of 19 species grown from wild-collected seeds to those from their farm-propagated offspring of up to four cultivation generations, produced by two European seed growers, in a common garden experiment. We found that some plants rapidly evolved across cultivated generations towards increased size and reproduction, lower within-species variability, and more synchronized flowering. In one species, we found evolution towards less seed shattering. These trait changes are typical signs of the crop domestication syndrome, and our study demonstrates that it can also occur during cultivation of wild plants, within only few cultivated generations. However, there was large variability between cultivation lineages, and the observed effect sizes were generally rather moderate, which suggests that the detected evolutionary changes are unlikely to compromise farm-propagated seeds for ecosystem restoration. To mitigate the potential negative effects of unintended selection, we recommend to limit the maximum number of generations the plants can be cultivated without replenishing the seed stock from new wild collections.\n\nSignificance StatementGlobally upscaling demands for native seeds for ecosystem restoration can be covered by agricultural seed propagation. Yet, agricultural practice can unintentionally select for specific traits and reduce adaptive variability, which could affect plant performance once sown back to the wild. We show, across 19 wild species, two seed producers and up to four consecutive cultivated generations, that some plants under cultivation evolved higher vigor, reduced adaptive variability, synchronized flowering and in one case, reduced seed shattering. Yet, there were substantial differences among cultivation lineages, with negligible changes in most, and large changes only in a few cases. Substantial unintended evolution in cultivation is thus rather an exception than the rule.",

    "abstract": "A central challenge in population genetics is the detection of genomic footprints of selection. As machine learning tools including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become more sophisticated and applied more broadly, these provide a logical next step for increasing our power to learn and detect such patterns; indeed, CNNs trained on simulated genome sequences have recently been shown to be highly effective at this task. Unlike previous approaches, which rely upon human-crafted summary statistics, these methods are able to be applied directly to raw genomic data, allowing them to potentially learn new signatures that, if well-understood, could improve the current theory surrounding selective sweeps. Towards this end, we examine a representative CNN from the literature, paring it down to the minimal complexity needed to maintain comparable performance; this low-complexity CNN allows us to directly interpret the learned evolutionary signatures. We then validate these patterns in more complex models using metrics that evaluate feature importance. Our findings reveal that common preprocessing steps play a central role in the learned prediction method, most commonly resulting in models that mimic a previously-defined summary statistic, which itself achieves similarly high accuracy. In other cases, preprocessing steps introduce artifacts that can lead to \"shortcut learning\". We conclude that human decisions still wield significant influence on these methods, hindering their potential to learn novel signatures. To gain new insights into the workings of evolutionary processes through the use of machine learning, we propose that the field focus on methods that avoid human-dependent preprocessing.\n\nAuthor summaryThe ever-increasing power and complexity of machine learning tools presents the scientific community with both unique opportunities and unique challenges. On the one hand, these data-driven approaches have led to state-of-the-art advances on a variety of research problems spanning many fields. On the other, these apparent performance improvements come at the cost of interpretability: it is difficult to know how the model makes its predictions. This is compounded by the computational sophistication of machine learning models which can lend a deceptive air of objectivity, often masking ways in which human bias may be baked into the modeling decisions or the data itself. We present here a case study, examining these issues in the context of a central problem in population genetics: detecting patterns of selection from genome data. Through this application, we show how human decision-making can influence model predictions behind the scenes, sometimes encouraging the model to see what we want it to see, and at other times, presenting the model with signals that allow it to circumvent the learning process. By understanding how these models work, and how they fail, we have a chance of creating new frameworks that are more robust to human biases.",

Lipophagy is often studied in yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which LDs become internalized into the vacuole. There is a lack of tools to quantitatively assess lipophagy in intact cells with high resolution and throughput. Here, we combine soft X-ray tomography (SXT) with fluorescence microscopy and use a deep learning computational approach to visualize and quantify lipophagy in yeast. We focus on yeast homologs of mammalian Niemann Pick type C proteins, whose dysfunction leads to Niemann Pick type C disease in humans, i.e., NPC1 (named NCR1 in yeast) and NPC2. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model which classifies ring-shaped versus lipid-filled or fragmented vacuoles containing ingested LDs in fluorescence images from wild-type yeast and from cells lacking NCR1 ({Delta}ncr1 cells) or NPC2 ({Delta}npc2 cells). Using a second CNN model, which performs automated segmentation of LDs and vacuoles from high-resolution reconstructions of X-ray tomograms, we can obtain 3D renderings of LDs inside and outside of the vacuole in a fully automated manner and additionally measure droplet volume, number, and distribution. We find that cells lacking functional NPC proteins can ingest LDs into vacuoles normally but show compromised degradation of LDs and accumulation of lipid vesicles inside vacuoles. This phenotype is most severe in{Delta} npc2 cells. Our new method is versatile and allows for automated high-throughput 3D visualization and quantification of lipophagy in intact cells.",

From the 37 trypanosome free goats, two goats (trypanosome donors) were used to take trypanosome isolates from naturally infected cattle (one from Jawi and the other from Jabitehenen areas). The remaining thirty five goats were randomly assigned into seven experimental groups, each containing five goats. These groups were again randomly selected, and three of them--Group 1 (JWI-1), Group 2 (JWI-DA), and Group 3 (JWI-ISM)--were inoculated with the Trypanosoma of Jawi isolate. Group-4 (JBI-1), Group-5 (JBI-DA), and Group-6 (JBI-ISM) were inoculated with the Trypanosoma of Jabitehenan isolate. The remaining group, Group 7 (NIC), was under negative control. Each experimental goat received 2 ml of trypanosoma positive blood at the 1x106 parasites/ml from donor goats through the jugular vein. Group NIC received 2 mL of sterile water as a negative control. For ten weeks following infection, parameters such as parasitaemia, body weight, PCV, and hemoglobin value were measured once per week. When peak parasitaemia was detected on day 14 of post infection, trypanocidal treatment was administered. Diminazine diaceturate (DA) was given at a dose of 28 mg/kg, and isomethamedium chloride (ISM) was given at a dose of 4 mg/kg. Trypanosomosis was detected on days 5 and 6 of post-infection (Pi) in Jabitehenan and Jawi, T. congolense isolates from infected groups, respectively. When peak parasitaemia was detected on day 14 of post infection, trypanocidal treatment was administered. 7 mg/kg for Group 2 and Group 5 and 1 mg/kg for Group 3 and Group 6 were the treatment doses for DA and ISM, respectively. All of the infected groups (groups 1 and 4; positive control) had severe clinical signs and recumbence within 27-59 days of infection. The mean PCV, total RBC, and Hgb concentration values of Jabitehenan isolate infected groups were significantly (P<0.05) lower than Jawi isolate infected groups, and severe clinical signs in group 4 occurred earlier than in group 1. These findings point to the presence of inter-isolate T. congolense variation. Neither of the DA nor ISM treatment groups attained complete recovery, and this shows the presence of disease resistance. A molecular-based study was this studys limitation, and it is recommended to confirm interisolate differences.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveMeniscus degeneration and subchondral bone changes contribute to the development and progression of knee OA. The purpose of this study was to reveal the relationship between medial meniscus degeneration and characteristics of subchondral bone changes in different models\n\nDesignWe used the anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACL-T) model, destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) model, controlled abnormal tibial translation (CATT) model and a controlled abnormal tibial rotation (CATR) model with different mechanical stresses. We performed histological analysis and micro computed tomography analysis, at 4 and 6 weeks. In addition, we divided the tibial subchondral bone into four compartments and set the regions of interest\n\nResultsMeniscus degeneration was observed in all groups, but there was no significant difference. The ACL-T group showed posterior displacement of the contact area, and the DMM and CATR groups showed lateral deviation of the medial meniscus. The region-specific subchondral bone changes in each model showed that changes in mechanical stress due to ACL and meniscus dysfunction, as well as changes in the contact area, affect the bony structure of the subchondral bone differently in each region.\n\nConclusionsSubchondral bone changes in different models of mechanical stress were different in each region. In particular, changes in the contact area and increased compressive stress due to meniscus dysfunction were suggested to promote bone formation. The results of this study indicate that changes in alignment and contact area in the PTOA model may cause region-specific characteristics of the subchondral bone changes.",

Using the description of 33 million histological samples we extract thousands of age- and mortality-associated features from text narratives that we call The Human Pathome (pathoage.com). Notably, we can broadly determine when pathological aging starts, indicating a sexual dimorphism with females aging earlier but slower and males aging later but faster. Using machine learning, we employ unsupervised topic-modelling to identify terms and themes that predict age and mortality. As a proof of principle, we cross reference these terms in PubMed to identify nintedanib as a potential aging intervention and show that nintedanib reduces markers of cellular senescence, reduces pro-fibrotic gene pathways in senescent cells and extends the lifespan of fruit flies.

    "abstract": "Understanding the interactions between patterns of recombination, mating systems, and signatures of natural selection is a central aim in evolutionary biology. Patterns of recombination shape the evolution of genomes by affecting the efficacy of selection. Within populations, genetic shuffling is achieved through meiotic recombination, random chromosome segregation, and the frequency of outbreeding. Recombination landscapes vary between species and populations, and are further influenced by mating systems. Here, we use populations of two related grass species, rye (Secale cereale) and barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum), that differ in their mating system, to analyse signatures of linked selection under divergent recombination landscapes. Rye (outbreeding) and barley (inbreeding) are members of the Poaceae and diverged approximately 15 M years ago. We estimated population recombination rates, analysed patterns of genetic diversity, identified signatures of linked selection, and quantified the fraction and functional class of genes affected by linked selection. In this comparison, we detected signatures of linked selection in low-recombining regions in both species. In inbreeding barley, the low-recombining fraction of the genome was more than 2-fold larger than in outbreeding rye. Furthermore, considering differences in gene density across the genome, approximately 1.5 times more genes were affected by linked selection in barley than in rye. In both species, genomic regions affected by linked selection harbour mostly genes involved in basic cellular processes. We provide empirical evidence for quantitative differences in recombination landscapes between closely related species of divergent mating systems, and discuss the consequences of linked selection and the efficacy of natural selection.\n\nSignificance statementThe ability of natural selection to disentangle beneficial from deleterious mutations across the genome is shaped by patterns of recombination, yet our understanding of the magnitude of this interaction is incomplete. In our work, we show that patterns of recombination differ between related outbreeding and inbreeding grass species, and that the efficacy of selection differs between them. We provide empirical evidence for quantitative differences in recombination landscapes and patterns of selection.",

By revealing the evolutionary history and loops appearance of GH19 chitinase, we discovered that one loop which is remote from the catalytic site, is necessary to acquire the new antifungal activity. We demonstrated that this remote loop directly accesses the fungal cell wall, and surprisingly, it needs to adopt a defined structure supported by long-range intramolecular interactions to perform its function.

    "abstract": "Extension of prostate cancer beyond the primary site into the surrounding organs by local invasion or nodal metastasis is associated with poor prognosis. The emergence and evolution of cancer clones at this early stage of expansion and spread has not been studied in detail. We performed whole genome sequencing on 42 prostate cancer samples from the prostate, seminal vesicles and regional lymph nodes of five treatment-naive patients with locally advanced disease who underwent radical prostatectomy. Using cancer cell fractions computed from single nucleotide variants and copy number alterations, we reconstructed the tumour phylogenies, which in turn allowed us to infer key molecular steps in the progression of prostate cancer in these individuals. We mapped the clonal composition of cancer sampled across the prostate in each individual and inferred the routes of spread of cancer cells within the prostate and to seminal vesicles and lymph nodes. Based on these data, we delineated the route of tumour progression and metastasis following the transformation of adenocarcinoma to amphicrine morphology, the molecular events leading to whole genome duplication associated with a single clonal expansion and identified putative driver events associated with local invasion and lymph node metastasis. We also correlated genomic changes associated with differences in morphology and identified putative driver events associated with spread to seminal vesicle invasion and lymph node metastasis. Taken together, these findings have implications for diagnosis and risk stratification, in addition to providing a rationale for further studies to characterise the genetic changes associated with morphological transformation. Our results demonstrate the value of integrating multi-region sequencing with histopathological data to study tumour evolution and identify mechanisms of prostate cancer spread.",

    "abstract": "The cardiac IKs ion channel comprises KCNQ1, calmodulin, and KCNE1 in a dodecameric complex which provides a repolarizing current reserve at higher heart rates and protects from arrhythmia syndromes that cause fainting and sudden death. Pharmacological activators of IKs are therefore of interest both scientifically and therapeutically for treatment of IKs loss-of-function disorders. One group of chemical activators are only active in the presence of the accessory KCNE1 subunit and here we investigate this phenomenon using molecular modeling techniques and mutagenesis scanning in mammalian cells. A generalized activator binding pocket is formed extracellularly by KCNE1, the domain-swapped S1 helices of one KCNQ1 subunit and the pore/turret region made up of two other KCNQ1 subunits. A few residues, including K41, A44 and Y46 in KCNE1, W323 in the KCNQ1 pore, and Y148 in the KCNQ1 S1 domain, appear critical for the binding of structurally diverse molecules, but in addition, molecular modeling studies suggest that induced fit by structurally different molecules underlies the generalized nature of the binding pocket. Activation of IKs is enhanced by stabilization of the KCNQ1-S1/KCNE1/pore complex, which ultimately slows deactivation of the current, and promotes outward current summation at higher pulse rates. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation of enhanced IKscurrents by these activator compounds and provide a map for future design of more potent therapeutically useful molecules.",

    "abstract": "Video games present a unique opportunity to study motor skill. First-person shooter (FPS) games have particular utility because they require visually-guided hand movements that are similar to widely studied planar reaching tasks. However, there is a need to ensure the tasks are equivalent if FPS games are to yield their potential as a powerful scientific tool for investigating sensorimotor control. Specifically, research is needed to ensure that differences in visual feedback of a movement do not affect motor learning between the two contexts. In traditional tasks, a movement will translate a cursor across a static background, whereas FPS games use movements to pan and tilt the view of the environment. To this end, we designed an online experiment where participants used their mouse or trackpad to shoot targets in both contexts. Kinematic analysis showed player movements were nearly identical between conditions, with highly correlated spatial and temporal metrics. This similarity suggests a shared internal model based on comparing predicted and observed displacement vectors, rather than primary sensory feedback. A second experiment, modelled on FPS-style aim-trainer games, found movements exhibited classic invariant features described within the sensorimotor literature. We found that two measures of mouse control, the mean and variability in distance of the primary sub-movement, were key predictors of overall task success. More broadly, these results show that FPS games offer a novel, engaging, and compelling environment to study sensorimotor skill, providing the same precise kinematic metrics as traditional planar reaching tasks.\n\nSignificance statementSensorimotor control underpins human behaviour and is a predictor of education, health, and socioemotional wellbeing. First-person shooter (FPS) games hold promise for studying sensorimotor control at scale, but the visual feedback provided differs from traditional laboratory tasks. There is a need to ensure they provide measures that relate to traditional tasks. We designed an experiment where the visual contingency of movements could be varied whilst participants shot targets. Participants movements were similar between contexts, suggesting the use of a common internal model despite the sensory differences. A second experiment observed canonical learning patterns with practice and found two measures of mouse control strongly predicted overall performance. Our results highlight the opportunity offered by FPS games to study situated skilled behaviour.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenicity of fibrillar assemblies derived from bacterially expressed recombinant prion protein (rPrP) has been key to the demonstration that prions are infectious proteins responsible for human and animal transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Yet, their use in identifying which structural PrP features are important for prion biology, including strain properties and capacity to transmit between species, has been hampered by their limited transmissibility de novo. We report the generation of prions with distinct biological characteristics from rPrP assemblies differing only in their primary structure (hamster, mouse and human amino acid sequence). These rPrP assemblies were transmissible to transgenic mice expressing hamster PrP, causing a clinical disease at full attack rate, brain deposition of pathological prion protein PrPSc and spongiform degeneration. Their adaptation process on serial sub-passaging seemed to depend, as for genuine prions, on the presence of a species/transmission barrier, due notably to PrP sequence mismatch. Remarkably, one of the strains obtained is an unprecedented shortened prion, lacking the 90-140 amino-acid region which is believed to be key to infectivity and structural stability of disease-associated PrP assemblies. Finally, we provide evidence that rPrP prionogenicity lies in the structural organization and/or heterogeneity of the rPrP assemblies. These preparations of rPrP offer unprecedented opportunities for meaningful studies correlating the dynamicity and structures of PrPSc assemblies to prion pathobiology.\n\nAuthor summaryPrions are infectious proteins, causing rapidly progressive neurodegenerative diseases in animals and humans. They are formed from the assisted-refolding and aggregation of the host-encoded prion protein (PrP). During the propagation of the disease, pathological PrP forces normal PrP to adopt its own conformation by a self-templating process. In infected host, different pathological structures of PrP or strains are found, causing diseases with specific biological phenotypes. Prions can also transmit between species. This capacity is limited by a species barrier, which critically depends on the infecting strain and PrP primary structure. How strain biological information is encoded in PrP structural fold remains unknown. We describe here the generation of different bona fide prion strains with markedly distinct adaptation capacities by transmission of refolded assemblies derived from bacterially-derived recombinant PrP (rPrP) of different species. We provide evidence that pathogenicity lies in the structural organization and/or heterogeneity of rPrP assemblies. Pathological PrP from one of the generated strains exhibited unique molecular features, including absence of domains that are thought to be key to prion infectivity, according to most recent ultrastructural studies. Our findings provide new insights for generating prion infectious material and resolving mechanisms of infectivity acquisition during PrP conversion process.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophage T3 encodes a SAMase that through cleavage of S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) circumvents the SAM-dependent Type I Restriction-Modification defence of the host bacterium Escherichia coli. Here, we show that the SAMase also allows T3 to evade BREX defence. SAM degradation weakly affects BREX methylation of host DNA, but completely inhibits the defensive function of BREX, suggesting that SAM is required as a co-factor for BREX-mediated exclusion of phage DNA. The anti-BREX activity of the T3 SAMase is mediated by two independent mechanisms: enzymatic degradation of SAM and downregulation of SAM synthesis through direct inhibition of the host SAM synthase MetK. We determined a 2.8 [A] cryo-EM structure of the eight-subunit T3 SAMase-MetK complex. Structure guided mutagenesis of the SAMase-MetK interface revealed that the interaction with MetK stabilizes the T3 SAMase in vivo, thus further stimulating its anti-BREX activity. This work provides insights in the versatility and intricacy of bacteriophage counter-defence mechanisms and highlights the role of SAM as an important co-factor of diverse phage-defence systems.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular Salmonella resides and multiplies in cholesterol-rich specialized compartment called Salmonella-containing vacuoles (SCVs) and avoids fusion with acidic lysosomes. Given, lysosomes are primary organelle that redistributes LDL derived cholesterol to other organelles; we questioned how lysosomal cholesterol can be transported to SCV. We demonstrate here that peroxisomes are recruited to SCVs in human primary macrophages, epithelial cells and functions as pro-bacterial organelles. Further, this interaction is assisted by SseI, a Salmonella effector protein containing mammalian peroxisome targeting sequence. SseI localizes to peroxisome, interacts and activates a host Ras GTPase, ARF-1 on the peroxisome membrane. Activation of ARF-1 leads to recruitment of phosphatidylinsolitol-5- phosphate-4 kinase to generate phosphatidylinsolitol-4-5-bisphosphate on peroxisomes. Accordingly, the{Delta} sseI strain showed reduced virulence in cell lines and during mice infection. Taken together, our work identified a fascinating mechanism by which a pathogen targets host organelles via its secretory effectors and exploits host metabolic intermediates for its intracellular proliferation.",

Here we identify the mechanisms that regulate the osk mRNA in the early embryo. We show that the Smaug (SMG) RBP is transported into the germ plasm of the early embryo where it accumulates in the germ granules. SMG binds to and represses translation of the osk mRNA itself as well as the bruno 1 (bru1) mRNA, which encodes an RBP that we show promotes germ plasm production. Loss of SMG or mutation of SMGs binding sites in the osk or bru1 mRNAs results in ectopic translation of these transcripts in the germ plasm and excess PGCs. SMG therefore triggers a post-transcriptional regulatory pathway that attenuates germ plasm synthesis in embryos, thus modulating the number of PGCs.",

    "abstract": "Retrotransposons and retroviruses shape genome evolution and can negatively impact genome function. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its close relatives harbor several families of LTR-retrotransposons, the most abundant being Ty1 in several laboratory strains. The cytosolic foci that nucleate Ty1 virus-like particle (VLP) assembly are not well-understood. These foci, termed retrosomes or T-bodies, contain Ty1 Gag and likely Gag-Pol and the Ty1 mRNA destined for reverse transcription. Here, we report a novel intrinsically disordered N-terminal prion-like domain (PrLD) within Gag that is required for transposition. This domain contains amino-acid composition similar to known yeast prions and is sufficient to nucleate prionogenesis in an established cell-based prion reporter system. Deleting the Ty1 PrLD results in dramatic VLP assembly and retrotransposition defects but does not affect Gag protein level. Ty1 Gag chimeras in which the PrLD is replaced with other sequences, including yeast and mammalian prionogenic domains, display a range of retrotransposition phenotypes from wildtype to null. We examine these chimeras throughout the Ty1 replication cycle and find that some support retrosome formation, VLP assembly, and retrotransposition, including the yeast Sup35 prion and the mouse PrP prion. Our interchangeable Ty1 system provides a useful, genetically tractable in vivo platform for studying PrLDs, complete with a suite of robust and sensitive assays, and host modulators developed to study Ty1 retromobility. Our work invites study into the prevalence of PrLDs in additional mobile elements.\n\nSignificanceRetrovirus-like retrotransposons help shape the genome evolution of their hosts and replicate within cytoplasmic particles. How their building blocks associate and assemble within the cell is poorly understood. Here, we report a novel prion-like domain (PrLD) in the budding yeast retrotransposon Ty1 Gag protein that builds virus-like particles. The PrLD has similar sequence properties to prions and disordered protein domains that can drive the formation of assemblies that range from liquid to solid. We demonstrate that the Ty1 PrLD can function as a prion and that certain prion sequences can replace the PrLD and support Ty1 transposition. This interchangeable system is an effective platform to study additional disordered sequences in living cells.",

    "abstract": "Several clades of luminescent bacteria are known currently. They all contain similar lux operons, which include the genes luxA and luxB encoding a heterodimeric luciferase. The aldehyde oxygenation reaction is catalyzed by the subunit LuxA, while LuxB is inactive. Recently, genomic analysis identified a subset of bacterial species with rearranged lux operons lacking luxB. Here, we show that Escherichia coli transformed with a synthetic luxA gene from the reduced luxACDE operon of Enhygromyxa salina is luminescent upon addition of aldehydes. Overall, EsLuxA is less bright compared to luciferases from Aliivibrio fischeri (AfLuxAB) and Photorhabdus luminescens (PlLuxAB), and most active with medium-chain C4-C9 aldehydes. Crystal structure of EsLuxA determined at the resolution of 2.71 [A] reveals a classical monooxygenase fold, and the protein preferentially forms a dimer in solution. The mobile loop residues 264-293, which form a {beta}-hairpin or a coil in Vibrio harveyi LuxA, form -helices in EsLuxA. Phylogenetic analysis shows EsLuxA and related proteins may be bacterial protoluciferases that arose prior to duplication of the luxA gene and its speciation to luxA and luxB in the previously described luminescent bacteria. Our work paves the way for discovery of new luciferases that have an advantage of being encoded by a single gene.",

The results of gene knockout studies showed that C. elegans GCP2 orthologs affect the pharyngeal physiology, reproduction, and structural integrity of the organism. Promoter-driven GFP expression revealed distinct localization for each of the three gene paralogs, with gcp-2.1 being most abundant in muscles, intestine, and pharyngeal interneurons, gcp-2.2 restricted to the phasmid neurons, and gcp-2.3 located in the excretory cell. This study provides new insight into the unique phenotypic effects of GCP2 gene knockouts in C. elegans, and the specific tissue localizations. We believe that elucidation of particular roles in a non-mammalian organism can help to explain important questions linked to human GCP2 physiology and in extension to GCP2 involvement in pathophysiological processes.",

In the present study, we proposed a new method for assessment of enzymatic cross-link based on FTIR microspectroscopy that takes into account secondary structure of type I collagen. Briefly, femurs were collected from sham or ovariectomized mice and subjected either to LC-MS or embedded in polymethylmethacrylate, cut and analyzed by FTIR microspectroscopy. FTIR acquisition were recorded before and after UV exposure or acid treatment. In addition, femurs from a second animal study were used to compare gene expression of Plod2 and Lox enzymes and enzymatic cross-links determined by FTIR microspectroscopy.\n\nWe evidenced here that intensities and areas of subbands located at [~]1660 cm-1, [~]1680 cm-1 and [~]1690 cm-1 were positively and significantly associated with the concentration of pyridinoline (PYD), deoxypyridinoline (DPD) or immature dihydroxylysinonorleucine (DHLNL) / hydroxylysinonorleucine (HLNL) cross-links. Seventy-two hours exposure to UV light significantly reduced by [~]86% and [~]89% the intensity and area of the [~]1660 cm-1 subband. Similarly, 24 hours of acid treatment significantly reduced by 78% and 76% the intensity and area of the [~]1690 cm-1 subband.

Particularly, breathing applies 3-dimensional cyclic stretches to the cells, while the stiffness of the interstitium changes in disease states, such as fibrosis and cancer. A platform was developed that effectively imitates the active forces in the alveolus, while allowing one to control the interstitium matrix stiffnesses to mimic fibrotic lung tumor microenvironments. Alveolar epithelial cancer cells were cultured on these platforms and changes in the glycocalyx expression were evaluated. A complex combination of stiffness and dynamic forces altered heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan expressions. Consequently, we designed liposomal nanoparticles (LNPs) modified with peptides that can target heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulfates of cell surface glycocalyx. Cellular uptake of these modified nanoparticles increased in stiffer conditions depending on the stretch state. Namely, chondroitin sulfate A targeting improved uptake efficiency in cells experiencing dynamic stretches, while cells seeded on static stiff interstitium preferentially took up heparan sulfate targeting LNPs. These results demonstrate the critical role that mechanical stiffness and stretching play in the alveolus and the importance of including these properties in nanotherapeutic design for cancer treatment.",

Previous research on the mapping between molecular sequence (genotype) and molecular fold (phenotype) has shown the presence of several structural properties in different biological contexts, implying that these might be universal in evolutionary spaces. The deterministic genotype-phenotype (GP) map that links short RNA sequences to minimum free energy secondary structures has been studied extensively because of its computational tractability and biologically realistic nature. However, this mapping ignores the phenotypic plasticity of RNA. We define a GP map that incorporates non-deterministic phenotypes, and take RNA as a case study; we use the Boltzmann probability distribution of folded structures and examine the structural properties of non-deterministic (ND) GP maps for RNA sequences of length 12 and coarse-grained RNA structures of length 30 (RNAshapes30). A framework is presented to study robustness, evolvability and neutral spaces in the non-deterministic map. This framework is validated by demonstrating close correspondence between the non-deterministic quantities and sample averages of their deterministic counterparts. When using the non-deterministic framework we observe the same structural properties as in the deterministic GP map, such as bias, negative correlation between genotypic robustness and evolvability, and positive correlation between phenotypic robustness and evolvability.",

We found that upon rehydration, there is a rapid microbial-autonomic induction of the immune system. We termed this response drought recovery-induced immunity (DRII). To reveal the immediate cell-type-specific responses that occur upon recovery we performed a single-nucleus transcriptome analysis of plants recovering from drought and profiled >126,000 transcriptomes. We found that the DRII response manifests in sub-populations of epidermal, trichome, and mesophyll cells immediately following rehydration. Finally, inoculation assays with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 demonstrated that DRII increases plant resistance against pathogens. Since rehydration increases microbial proliferation and thus, the risk for infection, the DRII response may be crucial for plant survival in water-fluctuating environments.",

As more novel species are brought to \"model status\", synthetic biologists are discovering that identically engineered genetic circuits can exhibit different performances depending on the organism it operates within, an observation referred to as the \"chassis-effect\". It remains a major challenge to uncover which genome encoded and physiological biological determinants will underpin chassis effects that govern the performance of engineered genetic devices. In this study, we compared model and novel bacterial hosts to ask whether phylogenomic relatedness or similarity in host physiology is a better predictor of toggle switch performance. This was accomplished using comparative framework based on multivariate statistical approaches to systematically demonstrate the chassis-effect and characterize the performance dynamics of a genetic toggle switch operating within six Gammaproteobacteria. Our results solidify the notion that genetic devices are significantly impacted by host-context. Furthermore, we formally determined that hosts exhibiting more similar metrics of growth and molecular physiology also exhibit more similar toggle switch performance, indicating that specific bacterial physiology underpins measurable chassis effects. The result of this study contributes to the field of broad-host-range synthetic biology by lending increased predictive power to the implementation of genetic devices in less-established microbial hosts.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2), is a causative agent of current global pandemic of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Due to propagated outbreak and global vaccination drive an immense immunological selection pressure has been exerted on SARS CoV-2 leading to evolution of new variants. This study was performed to compare the mutational and clinical profile of liver disease patients infected with different variants of SARS CoV-2.\n\nMethodologyThis was a single-centre, retrospective, cohort study in which clinicogenomic analysis of liver disease (LD) patients infected with SARS CoV-2 was performed. Complete demographic and clinical details were retrieved from Hospital Information System (HIS). QC-threshold passed FASTA files containing sequences from COVID-19 patients (n=174) were compared with a reference genome of SARS-CoV-2 isolate named Wuhan-Hu-1 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2) for mutational analysis.\n\nResultsOut of 232 finally analysed patients 137 (59.1%) were LD-CoV (+) and 95 (40.9%) were LD-CoV(-). LD patients with comorbidities were affected more with COVID-19 (p=0.002). On comparing the outcome in the terms of mortality, LD-CoV (+) had 2.29 times (OR 2.29, CI 95%, 1.25-4.29) higher of odds of succumbing to COVID-19 (p=0.006). Multivariate regression analysis revealed, abdominal distention (p=0.05), severe COVID-19 pneumonia (p=0.046) and the change in serum bilirubin levels (p=0.005) as well as Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels (p=0.003) to have an association with adverse outcome in LD patients with COVID-19. In Delta (22%) and Omicron (48%) groups, Spike gene harboured maximum mutations. On comparing the mutations between LD-CoV(+/D) and LD-CoV(+/O) a total of nine genes had more mutations in LD-CoV(+/O) whereas three genes had more mutations in LD-CoV(+/D).\n\nConclusionWe concluded that LD patients are more susceptible to COVID-19 as compared to a healthy adult with associated adverse clinical outcomes in terms of mortality and morbidity. Therefore this special group should be given priority while devising and introducing new vaccination and vaccination policies. The infection with different variants did not result in different outcome in our group of patients.",

Here, we extend these findings to N from the seasonal human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43, which is also robustly expressed on the surface of infected and non-infected cells by binding heparan-sulfate/heparin (HS/H). HCoV-OC43 N binds with high affinity to the same set of 11 human CHKs as SARS-CoV-2 N, but also to a non-overlapping set of 6 cytokines (CKs). As with SARS-CoV-2 N, HCoV-OC43 N inhibits CXCL12{beta}-mediated leukocyte migration in chemotaxis assays, as do all highly pathogenic and endemic HCoV N proteins. Together, our findings indicate that cell surface HCoV N plays important evolutionary conserved roles in manipulating host innate immunity and as a target for adaptive immunity.",

    "abstract": "Toxic bacterial modules, in particular toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, have been long sought-after for their antimicrobial potential, although with limited success1-6. Here we show that the cyclic-oligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling system (CBASS), another example of a toxic module, increases sensitivity to well-established antifolate antibiotics, interferes with their synergy, and ultimately enables bacterial lysis by antifolates - classic bacteriostatic antibiotics, in Vibrio cholerae. We propose a molecular mechanism for the CBASS-antifolate interaction based on onset of cyclic-oligonucleotide production by the nucleotidyltransferase DncV upon folate depletion by antifolates. CBASS-antifolate interaction is specific to CBASS systems with closely related nucleotidyltransferases and similar folate binding. Altogether, our findings illustrate that toxic modules, such as the antiphage defense CBASS system, can dramatically impact antibiotic activity, and open the possibility that endogenous metabolites could also act as triggers/silencers of toxic modules under stress beyond antibiotic treatment, such as during phage infection, biofilm formation or disease environments.",

    "abstract": "While the malaria parasite P. falciparum has low average genome-wide diversity levels, likely due to its recent introduction from a gorilla-infecting ancestor ([~]10,000-50,000 years ago), some genes display extremely high diversity levels. In particular, certain proteins expressed on the surface of human red-blood-cell-infecting merozoites (merozoite surface proteins, MSPs) possess exactly two deeply-diverged allelic forms that have not recombined. This phenomenon, called allelic dimorphism, is of considerable interest, but its origin and maintenance remains unknown.\n\nIn this study, we analysed the dimorphism in two highly-variable and paralogous MSPs, DBLMSP and DBLMSP2. Despite thousands of available Illumina WGS datasets from malaria-endemic countries, diversity in these genes has been hard to fully characterise as reads containing highly-diverged alleles fail to align to the reference genome. To solve this, we developed a pipeline leveraging genome graphs, enabling us to genotype them at high accuracy and completeness in comparison to a state-of-the-art GATK-based pipeline.\n\nUsing our newly-resolved sequences we found both genes are dimorphic in a specific protein domain (DBL), and that one of the two forms is shared across the genes. We identified clear evidence of non-allelic gene conversion between the two genes as the likely mechanism behind sharing, leading us to propose a new model for allelic dimorphism through gene conversion between diverged paralogs. This model is consistent with high diversity levels in these two genes despite the strong historical P. falciparum transmission bottleneck.",

However, compartment-RNA interactions that drive encapsulation have the potential to influence RNA structure and function in compartment- and RNA sequence-dependent ways. Herein, we detail Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) experiments performed for the first time in membraneless compartments called complex coacervates to characterize the fold of many different transfer RNAs (tRNAs) simultaneously under the potentially denaturing conditions of these compartments. Strikingly, we find that natural modifications favor the native fold of tRNAs in these compartments. This suggests that covalent RNA modifications could have played a critical role in metabolic processes at the origin of life.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe demonstrate that RNA folds into native secondary and tertiary structures in protocell models and that this is favored by covalent modifications, which is critical for the origins of life.",

    "abstract": "SORL1 encodes the retromer-associated receptor SORLA that functions in endosomal recycling. Rare variants in SORL1 have been associated with Alzheimers disease (AD) and rare pathogenic variants are estimated to occur in up to 2.75% of early onset AD patients and in 1.5% of unrelated late onset AD patients. While truncation mutations are observed almost exclusively in AD patients, it is currently unknown which among the hundreds of rare missense variants identified in SORL1, are pathogenic. Here we address this question by relying on SORLAs distinct molecular architecture. First, we completed a structure-guided sequence alignment for all the protein domains. Next, we identified proteins that contain domains homologous to those of SORLA, which include pathogenic variants for monogenic diseases. We identified the analogous domain positions of these variants in the SORLA protein sequence and showed that variants in these positions similarly impair SORL1, and lead to AD. Together, our findings represent a comprehensive compendium on SORLA protein variation and functional effects, which allowed us to prioritize SORL1 genetic variants into high or moderate priority mutations. We envision that this compendium will be used by clinical geneticists for assessing variants they identify in patients, allowing further development of diagnostic procedures and patient counseling strategies. Utimately, this compendium will inform investigations into the molecular mechanisms of endosomal recycling which will support the development of therapeutic treatment strategies for SORL1 variant-carrying patients.",

Herein, we aimed to enhance their efficacy by using a pyro-drive liquid jet injector that precisely controls pressure to widely disperse mRNA solution in the skin. The jet injection boosted naked mRNA delivery efficiency in the mouse skin. Mechanistic analyses indicate that dendritic cells, upon uptake of antigen mRNA in the skin, migrate to the draining lymph nodes for antigen presentation. Additionally, the jet injector activated innate immune responses in the skin, presumably by inducing physical stress, thus serving as a physical adjuvant. From a safety perspective, our approach, utilizing naked mRNA, restricted mRNA distribution solely to the injection site, preventing systemic pro-inflammatory reactions following vaccination. Ultimately, the jet injection of naked mRNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein elicited robust humoral and cellular immunity, providing protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice. Furthermore, our approach induced plasma activity of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates, comparable to that observed in mice, with no detectable systemic reactogenicity.",

However, the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains unclear. To clarify this issue, all-atom steered molecular dynamics and coarse-grained alchemical simulations were used to compare the binding affinity of mRNA to 40S ribosome in the absence and presence of NSP1. We found that NSP1 binding to the 40S ribosome dramatically increases the binding affinity of mRNA, which, in agreement with experiment, suggests that NSP1 can stall mRNA translation. The mRNA translation has been found to be driven by electrostatic mRNA-40S ribosome interactions. Water molecules have been demonstrated to play an important role in stabilizing the mRNA-40S ribosome complex.

    "abstract": "Adoptive cell therapy based on chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T (CAR-T) cells has proven to be lifesaving for many cancer patients. However, its therapeutic efficacy has so far been restricted to only a few malignancies, with solid tumors proving to be especially recalcitrant to efficient therapy. Poor intra-tumor infiltration by T cells and T cell dysfunction due to a desmoplastic, immunosuppressive microenvironment are key barriers for CAR T-cell success against solid tumors.\n\nCancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are critical components of the tumor stroma, evolving specifically within the tumor microenvironment in response to tumor cell cues. The CAF secretome is a significant contributor to the extracellular matrix and a plethora of cytokines and growth factors that induce immune suppression. Together they form a physical and chemical barrier which induces a T cell-excluding  cold TME. CAF depletion in stroma rich solid tumors can thus provide an opportunity to convert immune evasive tumors susceptible to tumor-antigen CAR T-cell cytotoxicity.\n\nUsing our TALEN-based gene editing platform we engineered non-alloreactive, immune evasive CAR T-cells (termed UCAR T-cells) targeting the unique CAF marker Fibroblast Activation Protein, alpha (FAP). In an orthotopic mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) composed of patient derived-CAFs and tumor cells, we demonstrate the efficacy of our engineered FAP UCAR T-cells in CAF depletion, reduction of desmoplasia and successful tumor infiltration. Furthermore, while previously resistant, pre-treatment with FAP UCAR T-cells now sensitized these tumors to Mesothelin (Meso) UCAR T-cell infiltration and anti-tumor cytotoxicity. Combination therapy of FAP UCAR, Meso UCAR T cells and the checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD-1 significantly reduced tumor burden and prolonged mice survival. Our study thus proposes a novel treatment paradigm for successful CAR-T immunotherapy against stroma-rich solid tumors.",

    "abstract": "Most aggressive lymphomas are treated with combination chemotherapy, commonly as multiple cycles of concurrent drug administration. Concurrent administration is in theory optimal when combination therapies have synergistic (more than additive) drug interactions. We investigated pharmacodynamic interactions in the standard 4-drug  CHOP regimen in Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) cell lines, and found that CHOP consistently exhibits antagonism and not synergy. We tested whether staggered treatment schedules could improve tumor cell kill by avoiding antagonism, using month-long in vitro models of concurrent or staggered treatments. Surprisingly, we observed that tumor cell kill is maximized by concurrent drug administration despite antagonistic drug-drug interactions. We propose that an ultrasensitive dose response, as described in radiology by the linear-quadratic (LQ) model, can reconcile these seemingly contradictory experimental observations. The LQ model describes the relationship between cell survival and dose, and in radiology has identified scenarios favoring hypofractionated radiation - the administration of fewer large doses rather than multiple smaller doses. Specifically, hypofractionated treatment can be favored when cells require an accumulation of DNA damage, rather than a  single hit, in order to die. By adapting the LQ model to combination chemotherapy and accounting for tumor heterogeneity, we find that tumor cell kill is maximized by concurrent administration of multiple drugs, even when chemotherapies have antagonistic interactions. Thus, our study identifies a new mechanism by which combination chemotherapy can be clinically beneficial that is not reliant on positive drug-drug interactions.",

Although ADAR1-p150 has been well established in this role, the functions of the constitutively expressed ADAR1-p110 isoform are less understood. We used proximity labeling to identify putative ADAR1-p110 interacting proteins in breast cancer cell lines. Of the proteins identified, the RNA helicase DHX9 was of particular interest. Knockdown of DHX9 in ADAR1-dependent cell lines caused cell death and activation of the dsRNA sensor PKR. In ADAR1-independent cell lines, combined knockdown of DHX9 and ADAR1, but neither alone, caused activation of multiple dsRNA sensing pathways leading to a viral mimicry phenotype.

Specific regions in the genome, called piRNA clusters, are thought to define each species piRNA repertoire and therefore its capacity to recognize and silence specific transposon families. The unistrand cluster flamenco (flam) is essential in the somatic compartment of the Drosophila ovary to restrict Gypsy-family transposons from infecting the neighbouring germ cells. Disruption of flam results in transposon derepression and sterility, yet it remains unknown whether this silencing mechanism is present more widely. Here, we systematically characterised 119 Drosophila species and identify five additional flam-like clusters separated by up to 45 million years. Small RNA-sequencing validated these as bona-fide unistrand piRNA clusters expressed in somatic cells of the ovary, where they selectively target transposons of the Gypsy family. Together, our study provides compelling evidence of a widely conserved transposon silencing mechanism that co-evolved with virus-like Gypsy-family transposons.",

Here, we present a comprehensive survey of the genetic features and genomic targets of human KZFPs, notably completing past analyses by adding data on more than a hundred family members. General principles emerge from our study of the TE-KZFP regulatory system, which point to multipronged evolutionary mechanisms underlaid by highly complex and combinatorial modes of action with strong influences on human speciation.",

    "abstract": "Seeds are an essential food source, providing nutrients for germination and early seedling growth. Degradation events in the seed and the mother plant accompany seed development. One degradation mechanism is autophagy, facilitating cellular component breakdown in the lytic organelle. Autophagy influences various aspects of plant physiology, specifically nutrient availability and remobilization, suggesting its involvement in source-sink interactions. During seed development, autophagy was shown to affect nutrient remobilization from mother plants and function in the embryo. Yet, these studies examined autophagy-knockout (atg mutant) plants, making it impossible to distinguish between the contribution of autophagy in the source (i.e., the mother plant) and the sink tissue (i.e., the embryo).\n\nTo address this, we employed a novel approach to differentiate between autophagy in source and sink tissues. We investigated how autophagy in the maternal tissue affects seed development by performing reciprocal crosses between WT and atg mutant Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Although F1 seedlings possessed a functional autophagy mechanism, etiolated F1 plants from maternal atg mutants displayed reduced growth. This was attributed to altered protein but not lipid accumulation in the seeds, suggesting autophagy differentially regulates carbon and nitrogen remobilization. Surprisingly, F1 seeds of maternal atg mutants exhibited faster germination, resulting from different seed coat development.\n\nOur study emphasizes the significance of examining autophagy in a tissue-specific manner, revealing valuable insights into the interplay between different tissues during seed development. It sheds light on the tissue-specific functions of autophagy, offering potential for new research into the underlying mechanisms governing seed development and crop yield.",

    "abstract": "Chemical control of protein activity is a powerful tool for scientific study, synthetic biology, and cell therapy; however, for broad use, effective chemical inducer systems must minimally crosstalk with endogenous processes and exhibit desirable drug delivery properties. Accordingly, the drug-controllable proteolytic activity of hepatitis C cis-protease NS3 and its associated antiviral drugs have been used to regulate protein activity and gene modulation. These tools advantageously exploit non-eukaryotic/prokaryotic proteins and clinically approved inhibitors. Here we expand the toolkit by utilizing catalytically inactive NS3 protease as a high affinity binder to genetically encoded, antiviral peptides. Through our approach, we create NS3-peptide complexes that can be displaced by FDA-approved drugs to modulate transcription, cell signaling, split-protein complementation. With our developed system, we discover a new mechanism to allosterically regulate Cre recombinase. Allosteric Cre regulation with NS3 ligands enables orthogonal recombination tools in eukaryotic cells and functions in divergent organisms to control prokaryotic recombinase activity.",

    "abstract": "Our previous studies identified a population of stem cell-like proliferating myeloid cells within inflamed tissues that could serve as a reservoir for tissue macrophages to adopt different activation states depending on the microenvironment. By lineage tracing cells derived from CX3CR1+ precursors in mice during infection and profiling by scRNA-seq, here we identify a cluster of BIRC5+ myeloid cells that expanded in the liver during either chronic infection with the parasite Schistosoma mansoni or the bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. In the absence of tissue damaging toxins, S. aureus infection does not elicit these BIRC5+ cells. Moreover, deletion of BIRC5 from CX3CR1 expressing cells results in improved survival during S. aureus infection. Hence, the combination of scRNA-Seq and genetic fate mapping CX3CR1+ cells revealed a toxin dependent pathogenic role for BIRC5 in myeloid cells during S. aureus infection.",
