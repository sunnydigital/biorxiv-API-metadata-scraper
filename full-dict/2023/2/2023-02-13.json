    "abstract": "The effective conservation of a species requires a thorough knowledge of its ecology. Long considered to live exclusively in rocky habitats, the European leaf-toed gecko (Euleptes europaea) has in fact been observed in vegetated and wooded habitats at several locations throughout its range. The tendency of this species to use these habitats seems to be clearly supported by its prehensile tail characteristic of geckos with arboreal behaviour. To better assess tree occupation by E. europaea and other co-occurring geckos, a site-occupancy survey was conducted in 2022 on the testing site of DGA (French MoD the Procurement Agency) of Levant Island (Hyeres, France). Two stands of Eucalyptus sp. containing 68 trees were selected to monitor. One stand lies in an anthropised context, consisting of scattered woodland and clear ground (stand 1), and the other represents a  natural forest context with dense ground vegetation (stand 2). The results revealed high occupancy by E. europaea in both stands, with an average occupancy probability of 0.57 (CI 0.40-0.72). The Mediterranean house gecko (Hemidactylus turcicus) and Moorish gecko (Tarentola mauritanica) had an average occupancy probability of 0.28 (CI 0.16-0.44) and 0.07 (CI 0.03-0.16) respectively. In stand 2, E. europaea was the only gecko species found, suggesting that it is better adapted to this type of forest habitat, which may represent a refuge for this species. In view of these results, the ecology of this species should be reconsidered and the research broadened by systematically including vegetated and forest habitats.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigated the insecticidal potency of phytochemicals from three indigenous botanicals namely Moringa oleifera (Drumstick tree), Vernonia amygdalina (Bitter leaf) and Ocimum gratissimum (Scent leaf) against adult mosquitoes of the Anopheles species, Aedes species and Culex species cum their larval habitats.\n\nCollection of the mosquito larval was made after scouting and identifying their breeding sites using scoops, plastic containers, sieves etc. Larva collection was done in the wet season (April to October) while the collected larva were conveyed to the laboratory and reared until they emerged into adults. A bioassay comprising twenty five adult mosquitoes from each of the three adult mosquito species were exposed to the botanicals at three different concentrations (5g/10ml, 10g/10ml and 15g/10ml) to assess their insecticidal potency which was measured through their knockdown rate (kdr) and mortality rate. The kdr were recorded at intervals for an hour while the mortality rates were recorded after 24hours of exposure.\n\nA total of 400 mosquito larva were collected and five larval habitat encountered. The three botanicals showed insecticidal potency against the adult mosquito species. However, O. gratissimum had the highest potency at 15g/10ml against Anopheles (46%) and Culex (34%) species respectively (p {square} 0.05). Aedes spp was resistant to the botanicals which may be due to a resistance barrier mechanism in Aedes spp that the botanicals lack the ability to break.\n\nThe botanicals could be adopted in the control of adult mosquitoes as they are biodegradable, eco-friendly and economical in contrast to synthetic insecticides with a view to consolidating global efforts on mosquito-borne diseases control and elimination with little or no human or environmental hazard.",

    "abstract": "Cortico-striatal neurocircuits mediate goal-directed and habitual actions which are necessary for adaptive behaviour. It has recently been proposed that some of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS), such as tics and repetitive behaviours, may emerge because of imbalances in these neurocircuits. We have recently developed a model of ASD and GTS by knocking down Immp2l, a mitochondrial gene frequently associated with these disorders. The current study sought to determine whether Immp2l knockdown (KD) in male mice alters flexible, goal- or cue-driven behaviour using procedures specifically designed to examine response-outcome and stimulus-response associations, which underlie goal-directed and habitual behaviour, respectively. Whether Immp2l KD alters neuron density in cortico-striatal neurocircuits known to regulate these behaviours was also examined. Immp2l KD mice and wild type-like mice (WT) were trained on Pavlovian and instrumental learning procedures where auditory cues predicted food delivery and lever-press responses earned a food outcome. It was demonstrated that goal-directed learning was not changed for Immp2l KD mice compared to WT mice, as lever-press responses were sensitive to changes in the value of the food outcome, and to contingency reversal and degradation. There was also no difference in the capacity of KD mice to form habitual behaviours compared to WT mice following extending training of the instrumental action. However, Immp2l KD mice were more responsive to auditory stimuli paired with food as indicated by a non-specific increase in lever response rates during Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer. Finally, there were no alterations to neuron density in striatum or any prefrontal cortex or limbic brain structures examined. Thus, the current study suggests that Immp2l is not necessary for learned maladaptive goal or stimulus driven behaviours in ASD or GTS, but that it may contribute to increased capacity for external stimuli to drive behaviour. Alterations to stimulus-driven behaviour could potentially influence the expression of tics and repetitive behaviours, suggesting that genetic alterations to Immp2l may contribute to these core symptoms in ASD and GTS. Given that this is the first application of this battery of instrumental learning procedures to a mouse model of ASD or GTS, it is an important initial step in determining the contribution of known risk-genes to goal-directed versus habitual behaviours, which should be more broadly applied to other rodent models of ASD and GTS in the future.",

    "abstract": "Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are environmentally ubiquitous and predominately cause pulmonary disease (NTMPD). The incidence of NTMPD has steadily increased and is now more prevalent than that of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) in the US. Moreover, the prevalence of NTMPD increases with age; therefore, it is likely that the burden of NTMPD will continue to increase in the coming decades as the number of those over the age of 65 increased in the U.S population. However, the mechanisms leading to higher susceptibility and severity of NTMPD with aging are poorly defined. Here, we used a rhesus macaque model of intrabronchial infection with M. avium complex in young and aged animals to address this knowledge gap. Unilateral infection resulted in a robust inflammatory response predominantly in the inoculated lung, however, immune cell infiltration and antigen-specific T cell responses were detected in both lungs. Nasal, oral, and fecal swabs, and BAL samples were profiled using 16S amplicon sequencing. These data suggested that decompartmentalization of the lower respiratory microbiome was occurring, evidenced by detection of bacterial DNA typically found in the gut and oral-pharyngeal cavity in bronchoalveolar samples following infection. Radiographic studies, gross pathology, and histopathology examination revealed increased disease severity in aged compared to young animals with pulmonary consolidation, edema, and lesions. Finally, single cell RNA sequencing indicated that aged animals generated a dysregulated macrophage and CD8 T cell response to MAC infection.",

    "abstract": "T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing data provides quantitative insight into the distribution of T-cell clones. The diversity of the TCR repertoire in humans tends do decrease with age, which may be a key determinant explaining immune senescence in older individuals. To address this, we first analyze how the diversity of a potential T-cell response against an unseen pathogen changes with age. Next, we discuss the complications with interpreting the outcomes of such an analysis. Specifically, the changes in T-cell subset sizes confound analyses of TCR diversity, and typical sample sizes do not easily allow for a robust quantification of this diversity. Thus, explaining immune senescence as a result of decreasing TCR diversity is far from straightforward and requires a detailed, robust, and quantitative analysis.",

    "abstract": "Grasslands are integral to maintaining biodiversity and key ecosystem services under climate change. Plant and soil biodiversity, and their interactions, support the provision of multiple ecosystem functions (multifunctionality). However, whether plant and soil biodiversity explain unique, or shared, contributions to supporting multifunctionality across global grasslands remains virtually unknown. Here, we combine results from a global survey of 101 grasslands with a novel microcosm study, controlling for both plant and soil microbial diversity to identify their individual and interactive contribution to support multifunctionality under aridity and experimental drought. We found that, plant and soil microbial diversity independently predict a unique portion of variation in above- and belowground functioning, suggesting both types of biodiversity complement each other. Interactions between plant and soil microbial diversity regulated primary productivity, nutrient storage, and plant productivity. Our findings were also context dependent, since soil fungal diversity was strongly associated to multifunctionality in less arid regions, while plant diversity was strongly linked to multifunctionality in more arid regions. Our results highlight the need to conserve both above- and belowground diversity to sustain grassland multifunctionality in a drier world and indicate climate change may shift the relative contribution of plant and soil biodiversity to multifunctionality across global grasslands.",

    "abstract": "Environmental change drives evolutionary adaptation, which determines geographic patterns of biodiversity. At a time of rapid environmental change, however, our ability to predict its evolutionary impacts is far from complete. Temporal environmental change, in particular, often involves joint changes in major components such as mean, trend, cyclic change, and noise. While theoretical predictions exist for adaptation to temporal change in isolated components, knowledge gaps remain. To identify those gaps, we review the relevant theoretical literature, finding that studies rarely assess the relative effects of components changing simultaneously, or attempt to translate theoretical predictions to field conditions. To address those gaps, we draw on classic evolutionary theory to develop a model for the evolution of environmental tolerance, determined by an evolving phenotypically plastic trait, in response to major components of temporal environmental change. We assess the effects of different components on the evolution of tolerance, including rates of adaptation towards new environmental optima, and the evolution of plasticity. We retrieve and synthesize earlier predictions of responses to components changing in isolation, while also generating new predictions of responses to components changing simultaneously. Notably, we show how different forms of environmental predictability emerging from the interplay of cyclic change, stochastic change (noise), and generation time shape predicted outcomes. We then parameterise our model using temperature time series from global marine hotspot in southern Australia, illustrating its utility for predicting testable geographic patterns in evolved thermal tolerance. Our framework provides new insights into the evolution of adaptation and plasticity under temporal environmental change, while offering a path to improving predictions of biological responses to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Competition among pollen or sperm (gametic selection) can cause evolution. Mating systems shape the intensity of gametic selection by determining the competitors involved, which can in turn cause mating system evolution. We model the bidirectional relationship between gametic selection and mating systems, focussing on variation in female mating frequency (monandry-polyandry) and self-fertilisation (selfing-outcrossing). First, we find that mating systems affect evolutionary responses to gametic selection, with more effective gametic selection when fertilisation success depends on haploid genotypes, rather than the diploid genotype of the father. Monandry and selfing both reduce the efficacy of gametic selection despite creating intense selection among pollen/sperm from heterozygous males with haploid expression. This effect means selfing can increase mutation load, in contrast to classic predictions where selfing purges deleterious mutations. Second, we show that mating systems can evolve via their effect on gametic selection, with polyandry evolving because it removes deleterious alleles more efficiently and increases offspring fitness. Our population genetic models reveal that this  good sperm effect could plausibly give a selective advantage for polyandry over monandry of only around 1%. Selection for polyandry is lessened further if some loci experience balancing selection and is likely to be overwhelmed by any direct fitness effects of mating systems. Similarly, the indirect benefits from manipulating gametic selection have a weak influence on the evolution of selfing, which is dominated by  automatic selection and inbreeding depression in our model. Nevertheless, gametic selection can be potentially decisive for selfing evolution because it significantly reduces inbreeding depression, which favours selfing. One test of the predicted interactions between gametic selection and mating system evolution would be to compare evolutionary rates in genes with different expression patterns across different mating systems.",

A recent transition from egg-laying to live-bearing in Littorina snails provides the opportunity to study the architecture of an innovation that has evolved repeatedly in animals. Samples do not cluster by reproductive mode in a genome-wide phylogeny, but local genealogical analysis revealed numerous genomic regions where all live-bearers carry the same core haplotype. Associated regions show evidence for live-bearer-specific positive selection, and are enriched for genes that are differentially expressed between egg-laying and live-bearing reproductive systems. Ages of selective sweeps suggest live-bearing alleles accumulated gradually, involving selection at different times in the past. Our results suggest that innovation can have a polygenic basis, and that novel functions can evolve gradually, rather than in a single step.",

    "abstract": "Acute exposure to ionizing radiation has well-documented, immediate negative consequences for individuals. However, the evolutionary consequences for populations exposed to ionizing radiation is unclear. For example, a meta-analysis of taxa exposed to Chernobyl fallout found some evidence for elevated mutation rates in animal and plant taxa; however, in people, de novo mutation rates in offspring of parents exposed to radiation during and after the Chernobyl accident were no higher than controls. Furthermore, whether irradiation and increased mutation rates drive adaptation to radiation also has mixed support. Ambiguity in both cases likely arises from the difficulty of studying mutation rates and adaptation after rare nuclear events whose ionizing radiation is distributed heterogeneously in time and space. Here, we report an attempt to better address this difficulty with a \"resurrection ecology\" study of Daphnia spp. in Utah lakes that experienced nuclear fallout from US Department of Energy weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s. The idea was to recover dormant Daphnia eggs from sediment cores that spanned the nuclear testing era in the American West. We predicted that survival and fecundity of eggs hatched in the lab would show fitness declines correlated with ionizing radiation fallout and a potential recovery once nuclear testing stopped. We successfully obtained multiple cores from three lakes that dated back to the 1800s. We isolated >4700 dormant eggs from those cores, spanning the nuclear era, but were only able to hatch a single egg in the lab. Thus, we could not conduct life history experiments to test our prediction. The purpose of this manuscript, therefore, is to describe the study and make our radioisotope core dating and sedimentation data available to other paleolimnological researchers. We also report a side study of stable isotope change through time measured from dormant eggs and the sediment.",

To support these next-generation controllers, we developed a new system called KIFNet (Kinematics and Image Fusing Network) that uses lightweight and efficient deep learning models to continuously predict the leg kinematics during walking. We tested different sensor fusion methods to combine kinematics data from inertial sensors and computer vision data from smart glasses and found that adaptive instance normalization achieved the lowest RMSE predictions for knee and ankle joint kinematics. We also deployed our model on an embedded device. Without inference optimization, our model was 20 times faster than the previous state-of-the-art and achieved 20% higher prediction accuracies, and during some locomotor activities like stair descent, decreased RMSE up to 300%. With inference optimization, our best model achieved 125 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano. These results demonstrate the potential to build fast and accurate deep learning models for continuous prediction of leg kinematics during walking based on sensor fusion and embedded computing, therein providing a foundation for real-time continuous controllers for robotic leg prostheses and exoskeletons.",

To overcome this issue, we created Petagraph, a large-scale BMKG that integrates biomolecular data into a schema incorporating the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Petagraph is instantiated on the Neo4j graph platform, and to date, has fifteen integrated biomolecular datasets. The majority of the data consists of entities or relationships related to genes, animal models, human phenotypes, drugs, and chemicals. Quantitative data sets containing values from gene expression analyses, chromatin organization, and genetic analyses have also been included. By incorporating models of biomolecular data types, the datasets can be traversed with hundreds of ontologies and controlled vocabularies native to the UMLS, effectively bringing the data to the ontologies.

Interestingly, Marchantia only possesses the cytosolic CuZnSOD isoform, whereas Physcomitrium additionally contains a plastidial isoform and Arabidopsis contains next to that a third peroxisomal isoform. An RNA-seq analysis revealed that the inhibition of CuZnSODs provoked a similar core response in all plant species analyzed, while those that contain more isoforms showed an extended response. In addition, an untargeted metabolomics approach revealed a specific metabolic signature for each plant species. Through the above approach the oxidative stress provoked by LCS-1 in plants can be specified and we argue that CuZnSOD functions are evolutionary conserved and might be important for plant terrestrialization.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (N) protein is responsible for condensation of the viral genome. Characterizing the mechanisms controlling nucleic acid binding is a key step in understanding how condensation is realized. Here, we focus on the role of the RNA Binding Domain (RBD) and its flanking disordered N-Terminal Domain (NTD) tail, using single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer and coarse-grained simulations. We quantified contact site size and binding affinity for nucleic acids and concomitant conformational changes occurring in the disordered region. We found that the disordered NTD increases the affinity of the RBD for RNA by about 50-fold. Binding of both nonspecific and specific RNA results in a modulation of the tail configurations, which respond in an RNA length-dependent manner. Not only does the disordered NTD increase affinity for RNA, but mutations that occur in the Omicron variant modulate the interactions, indicating a functional role of the disordered tail. Finally, we found that the NTD-RBD preferentially interacts with single-stranded RNA and that the resulting protein:RNA complexes are flexible and dynamic. We speculate that this mechanism of interaction enables the Nucleocapsid protein to search the viral genome for and bind to high-affinity motifs.",

    "abstract": "Insectivorous Old World horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) are the likely source of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 prior to its spillover into humans and causing the COVID-19 pandemic. Natural coronavirus infections of bats appear to be principally confined to the intestines, suggesting fecal-oral transmission; however, little is known about the biology of SARS-related coronaviruses in bats. Previous experimental challenges of Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) resulted in limited infection restricted to the respiratory tract, whereas insectivorous North American big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) showed no evidence of infection. In the present study, we challenged Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) with SARS-CoV-2 to determine their susceptibility. Infection was confined to the intestine for only a few days with prominent viral nucleocapsid antigen in epithelial cells, and mononuclear cells of the lamina propria and Peyers patches, but with no evidence of infection of other tissues; none of the bats showed visible signs of disease or seroconverted. Expression levels of ACE2 were low in the lungs, which may account for the lack of pulmonary infection. Bats were then intranasally inoculated with a replication-defective adenovirus encoding human ACE2 and 5 days later challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Viral antigen was prominent in lungs for up to 14 days, with loss of pulmonary cellularity during this time; however, the bats did not exhibit weight loss or visible signs of disease. From day 7, bats had low to moderate IgG antibody titers to spike protein by ELISA, and one bat on day 10 had low-titer neutralizing antibodies. CD4+ helper T cells became activated upon ex vivo recall stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid peptide library and exhibited elevated mRNA expression of the regulatory T cell cytokines interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-{beta}, which may have limited inflammatory pathology. Collectively, these data show that Jamaican fruit bats are poorly susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 but that expression of human ACE2 in their lungs leads to robust infection and an adaptive immune response with low-titer antibodies and a regulatory T cell-like response that may explain the lack of prominent inflammation in the lungs. This model will allow for insight of how SARS-CoV-2 infects bats and how bat innate and adaptive immune responses engage the virus without overt clinical disease.\n\nAuthor SummaryBats are reservoir hosts of many viruses that infect humans, yet little is known about how they host these viruses, principally because of a lack of relevant and susceptible bat experimental infection models. Although SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats, no robust infection models of bats have been established. We determined that Jamaican fruit bats are poorly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2; however, their lungs can be transduced with human ACE2, which renders them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Despite robust infection of the lungs and diminishment of pulmonary cellularity, the bats showed no overt signs of disease and cleared the infection after two weeks. Despite clearance of infection, only low-titer antibody responses occurred and only a single bat made neutralizing antibody. Assessment of the CD4+ helper T cell response showed that activated cells expressed the regulatory T cell cytokines IL-10 and TGF{beta} that may have tempered pulmonary inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins using XPO1 (exportin 1) plays a vital role in cell proliferation and survival. Many viruses also exploit this pathway to promote infection and replication. Thus, inhibiting XPO1-mediated nuclear export with selective inhibitors activates multiple antiviral and anti-inflammatory pathways. The XPO1 inhibitor, Selinexor, is an FDA-approved anticancer drug predicted to have antiviral function against many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Unexpectedly, we observed that pretreatment of cultured human cells with Selinexor actually enhanced protein expression and replication of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Knockdown of cellular XPO1 protein expression significantly enhanced the replication of coronaviruses in human cells. We further demonstrate that Selinexor treatment reduced the formation of unique cytoplasmic antiviral granules that include RNA helicase DHX9 in the virus-infected cells. These results, for the first time, show that the anti-cancer drug Selinexor enhances the replication of coronaviruses in human cells in vitro and thus should be further explored in vivo for the potential impact on the dual use for anticancer and antiviral therapy.",

Here, we show that Nsp5 binds and cleaves human tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TRMT1), a host enzyme required for a prevalent post-transcriptional modification in tRNAs. Human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a decrease in TRMT1 protein levels and TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications, consistent with TRMT1 cleavage and inactivation by Nsp5. Nsp5 cleaves TRMT1 at a specific position that matches the consensus sequence of SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage sites, and a single mutation within the sequence inhibits Nsp5-dependent proteolysis of TRMT1. The TRMT1 cleavage fragments exhibit altered RNA binding activity and are unable to rescue tRNA modification in TRMT1-deficient human cells. Compared to wildtype human cells, TRMT1-deficient human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit reduced levels of intracellular viral RNA. These findings provide evidence that Nsp5-dependent cleavage of TRMT1 and perturbation of tRNA modification patterns contribute to the cellular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the genomes of virus-infected cells by a LINE1-mediated retrotransposition mechanism. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) methods detected retrotransposed SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic sequences in virus-infected cells overexpressing LINE1, while an enrichment method (TagMap) identified retrotranspositions in cells that did not overexpress LINE1. LINE1 overexpression increased retrotranspositions about 1,000-fold as compared to non-overexpressing cells. Nanopore WGS can directly recover retrotransposed viral and flanking host sequences but its sensitivity depends on the depth of sequencing (a typical 20-fold sequencing depth would only examine 10 diploid cell equivalents). In contrast, TagMap enriches for the host-virus junctions and can interrogate up to 20,000 cells and is able to detect rare viral retrotranspositions in LINE1 non-overexpressing cells. Although Nanopore WGS is 10 - 20-fold more sensitive per tested cell, TagMap can interrogate 1,000 - 2,000-fold more cells and therefore can identify infrequent retrotranspositions. When comparing SARS-CoV-2 infection and viral nucleocapsid mRNA transfection by TagMap, retrotransposed SARS-CoV-2 sequences were only detected in infected but not in transfected cells. Retrotransposition in virus-infected in contrast to transfected cells may be facilitated because virus infection in contrast to viral RNA transfection results in significantly higher viral RNA levels and stimulates LINE1-expression which causes cellular stress.",

Using whole genome sequences of 44 falcons from different species and populations, including \"Altai\" falcons, we analyzed their population structure, admixture patterns and demographic history. We find that the Altai falcons are genomically mosaic of saker and gyrfalcon ancestries, and carry distinct W- and mitochondrial-haplotypes that cluster with the lanner falcon. The Altai haplotype diverged 422,000 years ago from the ancestor of sakers and gyrfalcons, both of which, in turn, split 109,000 years ago. The Altai W chromosome includes coding variants that may influence important structural, behavioral and reproductive traits. These findings support the designation of Altai falcons as a distinct falcon species (Falco altaicus).",

Over 14 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes are now available on GISAID, most sequenced and assembled via tiled amplicon sequencing. While computational tools for tiled amplicon design exist, they require downstream manual optimization both computationally and experimentally, which is slow, laborious, and costly. Here, we present Olivar, the first open-source computational tool capable of fully automating the design of tiled amplicons by integrating SNPs, non-specific amplification, etc. into a \"risk score\" for each single nucleotide of the target genome. Olivar evaluates thousands sets of possible tiled amplicons and minimizes primer dimer in parallel. In a direct in-silico comparison with PrimalScheme, we show that Olivar has fewer SNPs overlapping with primers and predicted PCR byproducts. We also compared Olivar head-to-head with ARTIC v4.1, the most widely used tiled amplicons for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. We next tested Olivar on real wastewater samples and found that our automated approach had up to 3-fold higher mapping rates compared to ARTIC v4.1 while retaining similar coverage. To the best of our knowledge, Olivar represents the first open-source, fully automated design tool that simultaneously evaluates and optimizes risks of known primer design issues for robust tiled amplicon sequencing.

Supplemental irrigation at the right timing and dose may increase yield dramatically.\n\nMethodsWe studied the response of a modern Kabuli chickpea cultivar to irrigation during the pod-filling period over three growing seasons (2019-2021) in northern Negev, Israel, under semi-arid conditions. Six irrigation treatments were applied based on crop coefficients (Kc) of 0, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.25, and 1.4 of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) as measured by a meteorological station on site. Morpho-physiological parameters and above-ground biomass accumulation were monitored throughout the cropping seasons, and the final grain yield was determined at maturation. Irrigation onset was determined based on the plants water potential (> 15 bar).\n\nResultsOur results indicate that optimal water status (as reflected by pressure chamber values) was in the range of 12-14 bar during the irrigation period. Irrigation according to evapotranspiration (ETc) with a crop coefficient factor (Kc) of 1.25 resulted in the highest grain yields over the three years. To ensure optimal water supply during the reproductive phase, one that is compatible with the crop water requirements, maintaining values of 25 mm node length above the Last Fully Developed Pod (LFDP) and a 90 mm distance between LFDP to the stem apex is recommended.\n\nConclusionsIrrigation onset when the crop is already at mild drought stress, followed by sufficient irrigation while following the indicated morphology and water potential values, may help farmers optimize irrigation and maximize chickpea crop production.",

    "abstract": "Plants can attenuate their molecular response to repetitive mechanical stimulation as a function of their mechanical history. For instance, a single bending of stem is sufficient to attenuate the gene expression in poplar plants to the subsequent mechanical stimulation, and the state of desensitization can last for several days. The role of histone modifications in memory gene expression and modulating plant response to abiotic or biotic signals is well known. However, such information is still lacking to explain the attenuated expression pattern of mechano-responsive genes in plants under repetitive stimulation. Using poplar as a model plant in this study, we first measured the global level of H3K9/14ac and H3K4me3 marks in the bent stem. The result shows that a single mild bending of the stem for 6 seconds is sufficient to alter the global level of the H3K9/14ac mark in poplar, highlighting the fact that plants are extremely sensitive to mechanical signals. Next, we analyzed the temporal dynamics of these two active histone marks at attenuated (PtaZFP2, PtaXET6, and PtaACA13) and non-attenuated (PtaHRD) mechano-responsive loci during the desensitization and resensitization phases. Enrichment of H3K9/14ac and H3K4me3 in the regulatory region of attenuated genes correlates well with their transient expression pattern after the first bending. Moreover, the levels of H3K4me3 correlate well with their expression pattern after the second bending at desensitization (3 days after the first bending) as well as resensitization (5 days after the first bending) phases. On the other hand, H3K9/14ac status correlates only with their attenuated expression pattern at the desensitization phase. The expression efficiency of the attenuated genes was restored after the second bending in the histone deacetylase inhibitor-treated plants. While both histone modifications contribute to the expression of attenuated genes, mechanostimulated expression of the non-attenuated PtaHRD gene seems to be H3K4me3 dependent.",

    "abstract": "Patents play a crucial role in the drug discovery process by providing legal protection for discoveries and incentivising investments in research and development. By identifying patterns within patent data resources, researchers can gain insight into the market trends and priorities of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, as well as provide additional perspectives on more fundamental aspects such as the emergence of potential new drug targets. In this paper, we used the patent enrichment tool, PEMT, to extract, integrate, and analyse patent literature for rare diseases (RD) and Alzheimers disease (AD). This is followed by a systematic review of the underlying patent landscape to decipher trends and applications in patents for these diseases. To do so, we discuss prominent organisations involved in drug discovery research in AD and RD. This allows us to gain an understanding of the importance of AD and RD from specific organisational (pharmaceutical or university) perspectives. Next, we analyse the historical focus of patents in relation to individual therapeutic targets and correlate them with market scenarios allowing the identification of prominent targets for a disease. Lastly, we identified drug repurposing activities within the two diseases with the help of patents. This resulted in identifying existing repurposed drugs and novel potential therapeutic approaches applicable to the indication areas. The study demonstrates the expanded applicability of patent documents from legal to drug discovery, design, and research, thus, providing a valuable resource for future drug discovery efforts. Moreover, this study is an attempt towards understanding the importance of data underlying patent documents and raising the need for preparing the data for machine learning-based applications.",

    "abstract": "The interplay between ecological and evolutionary dynamics can create feedback that reinforces external disturbances and potentially threatens species coexistence. For example, plants might invest less into attracting insect pollinators (decreased flower or nectar production) and more into independence (increased selfing or vegetative reproduction) when faced with pollinator decline. This adaptive response saves plant resources at the cost of further threatening the pollinator population. We ask under which conditions such self-reinforcing feedback occurs in two-species mutualistic systems when considering one-sided population decline and whether it can be counteracted by self-dampening feedback if co-evolution of both interaction partners is considered. Based on a mathematical model and in line with previous studies, we find that the described pattern of accelerated population decline occurs for a wide range of parameter values if a concave allocation trade-off between independent growth and interaction investment is assumed. The undisturbed population typically disinvests first, which then forces the declining population to also disinvest, in favour of other energy sources. However, a decelerated population decline can occur if the adaptation of the undisturbed partner is relatively slow compared to environmental decay, reducing the speed of its disinvestment, or if the initial investment into the interaction was very high. Our results suggest that if actions are taken to save endangered populations, not only the evolution of the target species but also of their interaction partner, as well as the interaction between them should be considered.",

Interestingly, STR expansions underlie about 60 neurological disorders. However, \"stutter\" artifacts or noises render it difficult to investigate the pathogenesis of STR expansions. Here, we systematically investigated STR instability in cultured human cells using GC-rich CAG and AT-rich ATTCT tandem repeats as examples. We found that triplicate bidirectional Sanger sequencing with PCR amplification under proper conditions can reliably assess STR length. In addition, we found that next-generation sequencing with paired-end reads bidirectionally covering STR regions can accurately and reliably assay STR length. Finally, we found that STRs are intrinsically unstable in cultured human cell populations and during single-cell cloning. Our data suggest a general method for accurately and reliably assessing STR length and have important implications in investigating pathogenesis of STR expansion diseases.",

    "abstract": "The enhancer-promoter looping model, in which enhancers activate their target genes via physical contact, has long dominated the field of gene regulation. However, the ubiquity of this model has been questioned due to evidence of alternative mechanisms and the lack of its systematic validation, primarily owing to the absence of suitable experimental techniques. In this study, we present a new MNase-based proximity ligation method called MChIP-C, allowing for the measurement of protein-mediated chromatin interactions at single-nucleosome resolution on a genome-wide scale. By applying MChIP-C to study H3K4me3 promoter-centered interactions in K562 cells, we found that it had greatly improved resolution and sensitivity compared to restriction endonuclease-based C-methods. This allowed us to identify EP300 histone acetyltransferase and the SWI/SNF remodeling complex as potential candidates for establishing and/or maintaining enhancer-promoter interactions. Finally, leveraging data from published CRISPRi screens, we found that most functionally-verified enhancers do physically interact with their cognate promoters, supporting the enhancer-promoter looping model.",

Specifically, resolution loss can occur if the electron diffraction pattern is magnified to extend phase contrast to lower spatial frequencies, and if conductive materials are placed too close to the electron beam. While our initial implementation of a laser phase plate (LPP) was significantly affected by these factors, a redesign eliminated the problem and brought the performance close to the expected level. The resolution now appears to be limited by residual Johnson noise arising from the electron beam liner tube in the region of the LPP, together with the chromatic aberration of the relay optics. These two factors can be addressed during future development of the LPP.",

Gene ontology-based functional assignments revealed for the nodal cell sample main upregulated molecular functions related to protein binding, nucleic acid binding and DNA binding. Looking at specific genes, several signalling-related genes and genes encoding sugar-metabolizing enzymes were found to be expressed at a higher level in the nodal cell sample, while photosynthesis-and chloroplast-related genes were expressed at a comparatively lower level.

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury can lead to multiple pathologic features, including brain lesions, which are visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These resulting heterogenous lesions can present a difficulty for several standard approaches to neuroimaging, resulting in bias and error in subsequent quantitative measurements. Thus, cases presenting with lesions on MRI may be excluded from analyses, biasing samples across the research field. We outline a potential solution to this issue in the case of Freesurfer, a popular neuroimaging tool for surface-based segmentation of brain tissue from structural MRI. The proposed solution involves two-steps, a) Pre-processing: Enantiomorphic Lesion-Filling and b) Post-processing: Lesion Labelling. We applied this methodology to 14 pediatric TBI cases which presented with lesions on T1w MRI. Following qualitative inspection of these cases after implementation of the approach, 8 out of 14 cases were retained as being of sufficient quality. In brief, we have presented here an adapted pipeline for processing structural MRI (sMRI) of patients who have experienced a TBI using the Freesurfer software package. This approach aims to mitigate potential lesion-induced biases that exist beyond the locality of the pathological tissue, even in the contralesioned hemisphere.",

Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is commonly applied for hematoma evacuation in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) after ICH. However, rtPA may contact directly with brain tissue during MIS procedure, which makes it necessary to discuss the safety of rtPA. We found that, in the in vivo ICH model induced by VII-type collagenase, rtPA treatment improved the neurological function of ICH mice, alleviated the pathological damage and decreased the apoptosis and autophagy level of the peri-hematoma tissue. In the in-vitro model of ICH induced by hemin, the administration of rtPA down-regulated neuronal apoptosis, autophagy, and endoplasmic reticulum stress of neurons. Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that rtPA treatment upregulated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in neurons, and PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) can reverse the protective effects of rtPA in inhibiting excessive apoptosis, autophagy and ER-stress. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (AG-1487) reversed the effect of rtPA on PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which might indicate that the EGF domain played an important role in the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.",

Using non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, we show that some CD8+ T cells specific for the islet antigen, islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (IGRP) displayed terminal exhaustion characteristics within pancreatic islets but were maintained in the TPEX cell state in peripheral lymphoid organs. To examine the impact of antigen on T cell exhaustion in diabetes, we generated transgenic NOD mice with inducible IGRP expression in peripheral antigen presenting cells. Antigen exposure in the extra-islet environment induced severely exhausted IGRP-specific T cells with reduced ability to produce IFN{gamma}, which protected these mice from diabetes. Our data demonstrate that T cell exhaustion induced by delivery of antigen can be harnessed to prevent autoimmune diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Cholera toxin, encoded by the ctx gene, is a key virulence factor in toxigenic Vibrio cholerae (ctx+) strains. However, some non-toxigenic V. cholerae (ctx-) strains are also pathogenic to humans and the mechanism involved in low-pH tolerance and pathogenicity in these strains remains unclear. To address this, we profiled the growth and chitinase activity in different pH of two clinical isolates of V. cholerae: VC20, a ctx+ strain, and WO5, a ctx- strain. We also compared the expression level of key genes involved in pathogenesis between the strains. WO5, the non-toxigenic strain had robust growth and greater chitinase activity across a wide pH range, in comparison to VC20. Additionally, WO5 expressed higher levels of transcripts from genes implicated in host cell adhesion and virulence, namely ompK and toxT, respectively. Notably, we propose that lower hapR levels in WO5 contrary to VC20 is key to its low-pH tolerance. To systematically identify genes involved in low pH tolerance, we used a sequence-based homology search and found a widespread presence of low-pH adaptation modules, lysine-cadaverine, and ornithine-putrescine in multiple representative species of the Vibrio phylum. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the loss of a gene encoding nitrite reductase that confers low pH tolerance is specific to V. cholerae and V. mimicus. Together, these findings reveal that the low-pH tolerance enhances the chitinase activity of the non-toxigenic strain that could help V. cholerae to survive the acidic environment of the stomach and readily colonize the intestine.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neuromuscular disease that affects all voluntary muscles in the body, leading to paralysis and respiratory failure, while the extraocular muscles (EOMs) are largely spared even at the end-stage of ALS. Through whole-mount muscle imaging, we detected severe denervation along with depletion of Pax7+ satellite cells (SCs) peri-neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in hindlimb and diaphragm muscles of end-stage SOD1G93A mice (a familial ALS mouse model), but not in EOMs. Upon isolating SCs from different muscles using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), the FACS profiles of hindlimb and diaphragm SCs of G93A mice exhibited activation and depletion phenotypes but not in wildtype controls. Importantly, both wildtype and G93A EOM SCs exhibited spontaneous activation behavior without significant differences in abundance. Examination of Pax7+ and Ki67+ cell ratios and RNA-Seq of SCs cultured in growth and differentiation medium revealed that EOM SCs maintained renewability and stemness better than diaphragm and hindlimb counterparts, especially in differentiation-favoring environments. Comparative functional annotation analyses indicate enrichment of axon guidance molecules, such as Cxcl12, in cultured EOM SCs. In neuromuscular coculture experiments, overexpressing Cxcl12 in G93A hindlimb SC-derived myotubes enhanced motor neuron axon extension and improved innervation, partially replicating the multi-innervation property of EOM SC-derived myotubes. The unique SC homeostasis regulation and the production of axon guidance molecules including Cxcl12 may explain the ALS resistant nature of EOMs. Intriguingly, feeding G93A mice with sodium butyrate extended the life span of G93A mice, alleviated NMJ denervation and SCs depletion. Butyrate treatment promoted renewability and stemness of cultured G93A hindlimb and diaphragm SCs, as well as Cxcl12 expression. Thus, butyrate-induced EOM SC-like transcriptomic patterns may contribute to its beneficiary effects observed in G93A mice.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is shifting species ranges and altering reproductive interactions within those ranges, offering closely-related species new scope to mate and potentially hybridize. Predicting hybridization and its outcomes requires assessing the interplay of biological and climatic factors that mediate reproductive barriers across life stages. However, few studies have done so across the range of environments that parents and offspring potentially encounter in nature, as is crucial to understand the environmental sensitivity of reproductive isolation and its fate under climate change. We set out to assess prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive barriers, and their dependence on temperature and sex, in sister species of a marine tubeworm (Galeolaria) from a sentinel region for climate change impacts in southern Australia. We performed reciprocal crosses within- and between-species using replicate populations, and assessed fertility of crosses, survival of embryos, and survival of larvae, at five temperatures spanning the thermal ranges of populations in nature. We found that barriers were weak and independent of temperature at fertilization, but stronger and more temperature-sensitive at larval development, as species diverged in thermal tolerance. Barriers were asymmetric between reciprocal hybrids, moreover, suggesting a complex interplay between thermal adaptation in parental lineages and maternal inheritance of factors (e.g., mitochondria, endosymbionts) that influence hybrid viability across temperatures. Together, our findings provide new insights into the roles of temperature and sex in reproductive barriers across early life stages, and point to shifting strengths of reproductive isolation in future climates.",

Here, we used integrative single-cell sequencing on insectivorous and frugivorous bat kidneys and pancreases and identified key cell population, gene expression and regulatory element differences associated with frugivorous adaptation that also relate to human disease, particularly diabetes. We found an increase in collecting duct cells and differentially active genes and regulatory elements involved in fluid and electrolyte balance in the frugivore kidney. In the frugivorous pancreas, we observed an increase in endocrine and a decrease in exocrine cells and differences in genes and regulatory elements involved in insulin regulation.

To determine the spatial distribution of cell types in SRT, we present SpaDecon, a semi-supervised learning approach that incorporates gene expression, spatial location, and histology information for cell-type deconvolution. SpaDecon was evaluated through analyses of four real SRT datasets using knowledge of the expected distributions of cell types. Quantitative evaluations were performed for four pseudo-SRT datasets constructed according to benchmark proportions. Using mean squared error and Jensen-Shannon divergence with the benchmark proportions as evaluation criteria, we show that SpaDecon performance surpasses that of published cell-type deconvolution methods. Given the accuracy and computational speed of SpaDecon, we anticipate it will be valuable for SRT data analysis and will facilitate the integration of genomics and digital pathology.",

We generated a highly contiguous whole-genome sequence for T. bakamatsutake SF-Tf05 isolated in an oak (Quercus salicina) forest in Japan. The assembly of high-fidelity long reads, with a median read length of 12.3 kb, resulted in 13 chromosome-sized contigs comprising 142,068,211 bases with an average GC content of 43.94%. The 13 chromosomes were predicted to encode 11,060 genes. A contig (122,566 bases) presumably containing the whole circular mitochondrial genome was also recovered. The chromosome-wide comparison of T. bakamatsutake and T. matsutake (TMA_r1.0) indicated that the basic number of chromosomes (13) was conserved, but the structures of the corresponding chromosomes diverged, with multiple inversions and translocations. Gene conservation and cluster analyses revealed at least three groups in Tricholoma. Specifically, all T. bakamatsutake strains belonged to the \"bakamatsutake\" clade, which is most proximal to the \"caligatum\" clade consisting of T. caligatum and T. fulvocastaneum. The constructed highly contiguous telomere-to-telomere genome sequence of a T. bakamatsutake isolate will serve as a fundamental resource for future research on the evolution and differentiation of Tricholoma species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMany computational methods have been developed to detect non-reference transposable element (TE) insertions using short-read whole genome sequencing data. The diversity and complexity of such methods often present challenges to new users seeking to reproducibly install, execute or evaluate multiple TE insertion detectors.\n\nResultsWe previously developed the McClintock meta-pipeline to facilitate the installation, execution, and evaluation of six first-generation short-read TE detectors. Here, we report a completely re-implemented version of McClintock written in Python using Snakemake and Conda that improves its installation, error handling, speed, stability, and extensibility. McClintock 2 now includes 12 short-read TE detectors, auxiliary pre-processing and analysis modules, interactive HTML reports, and a simulation framework to reproducibly evaluate the accuracy of component TE detectors. When applied to the model microbial eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we find substantial variation in the ability of McClintock 2 components to identify the precise locations of non-reference TE insertions, with RelocaTE2 showing the highest recall and precision in simulated data. We find that RelocaTE2, TEMP, TEMP2 and TEBreak provide a consistent and biologically meaningful view of non-reference TE insertions in a species-wide panel of ~1000 yeast genomes, as evaluated by coverage-based abundance estimates and expected patterns of tRNA promoter targeting. Finally, we show that best-in-class predictors for yeast have sufficient resolution to reveal a dyad pattern of integration in nucleosome-bound regions upstream of yeast tRNA genes for Ty1, Ty2, and Ty4, allowing us to extend knowledge about fine-scale target preferences first revealed experimentally for Ty1 to natural insertions and related copia-superfamily retrotransposons in yeast.\n\nConclusionMcClintock (https://github.com/bergmanlab/mcclintock/) provides a user-friendly pipeline for the identification of TEs in short-read WGS data using multiple TE detectors, which should benefit researchers studying TE insertion variation in a wide range of different organisms. Application of the improved McClintock system to simulated and empirical yeast genome data reveals best-in-class methods and novel biological insights for one of the most widely-studied model eukaryotes and provides a paradigm for evaluating and selecting non-reference TE detectors for other species.",

However, current N terminomics technologies have sequence limitations or require specialized synthetic reagents for N-terminal peptide isolation.

These tools enable efficient enrichment of protein N termini by combining selective N-terminal biotinylation using 2PCA reagents with chemically cleavable linkers for N-terminal peptide recovery. By incorporating a commercially available alkyne-modified 2PCA in combination with Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), our strategy eliminates the need for chemical synthesis of N-terminal probes. Using these reagents, we developed PICS2 (Proteomic Identification of Cleavage Sites with 2PCA reagents) to profile the specificity of subtilisin/kexin-type proprotein convertases (PCSKs). We also implemented CHOPPER (Chemical enrichment Of Protease substrates with Purchasable, Elutable Reagents) for global sequencing of apoptotic proteolytic cleavage sites. Based on their broad applicability and ease of implementation, PICS2 and CHOPPER are useful tools that will advance our understanding of protease biology.",

The model was validated by replicating three experimental studies: NBDLs high acceleration profile, Zhangs linear and rotational acceleration profiles, and Nahums impact study. The results showed reasonable geometrical fidelity. The intracranial pressure and brain stress data of our head-only model (excluded neck structures and constrained the base of the skull) were similar to Nahums and Zhangs reported results. As neck structures were not considered in Nahums and Zhangs studies, the FE results of our head-neck model showed slight discrepancies. Notably, the addition of neck structures (head-neck model) reduced brain stress-strain values and uncovered the brains intracranial pressure dynamics, which the head-only model failed to capture. Nevertheless, the FE simulation results showed a good agreement (r > 0.97) between the kinematic responses of our head-neck model and NBDLs experimental results. Therefore, the developed head-neck model can be used as a computational tool for an accurate and comprehensive understanding of the brain injury mechanism in various head impact scenarios.",

We leveraged a microfluidic organ-on-a-chip lined by human lung alveolar epithelium interfaced with pulmonary endothelium to model acute radiation-induced lung injury in vitro. Both lung epithelium and endothelium exhibited DNA damage, cellular hypertrophy, upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, and loss of barrier function within 6 h of radiation exposure, although greater damage was observed in the endothelium. Transcriptomic analysis revealed increased expression of the cytoprotective gene, hemoxygenase-1 (HMOX-1) and gene network analysis identified it as a central mediator of radiation-induced injury. Pharmacological stimulation of HMOX-1 activity also significantly reduced acute radiation-induced lung injury, although it enhanced damage at later times. Thus, this human lung chip offers a new platform to study ARS and these results suggest that HMOX-1 may be mechanistically involved in this injury response.",

In medically managed patients, long-term aneurysmal dilatation of the false lumen (FL) is considered virtually inevitable and is associated with poorer disease outcomes. While the pathophysiological mechanisms driving FL dilatation are not yet understood, hemodynamic factors are believed to play a key role. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and 4D-Flow MRI (4DMR) analyses have revealed correlations between flow helicity, oscillatory wall shear stress, and aneurysmal dilatation of the FL. In this study, we compare CFD simulations using a patient-specific, three-dimensional, three-component inlet velocity profile (3D IVP) extracted from 4DMR data against simulations with flow rate-matched uniform and axial velocity profiles that remain widely used in the absence of 4DMR. We also evaluate the influence of measurement errors in 4DMR data by scaling the 3D IVP to the degree of imaging error detected in prior studies. We observe that oscillatory shear and helicity are highly sensitive to inlet velocity distribution and flow volume throughout the FL and conclude that the choice of IVP may greatly affect the future clinical value of simulations.",

We show that RTK biased signaling can occur in the first step of signal transduction not only in response to different ligands, but as a consequence of RTK pathogenic mutations as well. Ligand bias and mutation-induced bias are uncoupled here based on a comprehensive data set of dose response curves acquired for three ligands, EGF, TGF and epiregulin, for wild-type EGFR and for the oncogenic L834R EGFR mutant found in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Ligand bias has been extensively studied for GPCRs, and has revolutionized the GPCR field.

    "abstract": "Understanding factors affecting ectothermic fishes capacity to cope with warming temperature is critical given predicted climate change scenarios. We know that a fishs social environment introduces plasticity in how it responds to high temperature. However, the magnitude of this plasticity and the mechanisms underlying socially-modulated thermal responses are unknown. Using the amphibious, selfing hermaphroditic mangrove rivulus fish (Kryptolebias marmoratus) as a model, we tested three hypotheses: 1) social stimulation affects physiological and behavioural thermal responses of isogenic lineages of fish, 2) social experience and acute social stimulation result in distinct physiological and behavioural responses, and 3) a desensitization of thermal receptors is responsible for socially modulated thermal responses. To test the first two hypotheses, we measured the temperature at which fish emerged (i.e., pejus temperature) with acute warming with socially naive, isolated fish and socially experienced fish. Our results did not support our first hypothesis as fish socially-stimulated by mirrors during warming (i.e., acute social stimulation) emerged at similar temperatures as isolated fish. However, in support of our second hypothesis, prior social experience resulted in fish emerging at a higher temperature than socially naive fish suggesting an increase in pejus temperature with social experience. We measured whole-body cortisol concentrations of socially naive and socially experienced fish and determined that socially experienced fish had significantly higher cortisol concentrations than socially naive fish. To test our third hypothesis, we exposed socially experienced and naive fish to capsaicin, an agonist of TRPV1 thermal receptors. Socially experienced fish emerged at significantly higher capsaicin concentrations than socially naive fish suggesting a desensitization of their TRPV1 thermal receptors. Collectively, our data indicate that past and present social experiences impact the behavioural response of fish to high temperature. We also provide novel data suggesting that social experience affects the capacity of fish to perceive warm temperature.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveSchizophrenia is associated with widespread brain-morphological alterations, believed to be shaped by the underlying connectome architecture. This study tests whether large-scale structural reorganization in schizophrenia relates to normative network architecture, in particular regional centrality/hubness and connectivity patterns. We examine network effects in schizophrenia across different disease stages, and transdiagnostically explore consistency of such relationships in patients with bipolar and major depressive disorder.\n\nMethodsWe studied anatomical MRI scans from 2,439 adults with schizophrenia and 2,867 healthy controls from 26 ENIGMA sites. Case-control patterns of structural alterations were evaluated against two network susceptibility models: 1) hub vulnerability, which examines associations between regional network centrality and magnitude of disease-related alterations; 2) epicenter models, which identify regions whose typical connectivity profile most closely resembles the disease-related morphological alteration patterns. Both susceptibility models were tested across schizophrenia disease stages and compared to meta-analytic bipolar and major depressive disorder case-control maps.\n\nResultsIn schizophrenia, regional gray matter reductions co-localized with interconnected hubs, in both the functional (r=0.58, pspin<0.0001) and structural connectome (r=0.32, pspin=0.01). Epicenters were identified in temporo-paralimbic regions, extending to frontal areas. We found unique epicenters for first-episode and early stages, and a shift from occipital to temporal-frontal epicenters in chronic stages. Transdiagnostic comparisons revealed shared epicenters in schizophrenia and bipolar, but not major depressive disorders.\n\nConclusionsCortical reorganization over the course of schizophrenia closely reflects brain network architecture, emphasizing marked hub susceptibility and temporo-frontal epicenters. The observed overlapping epicenters for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder furthermore suggest shared pathophysiological processes within the schizophrenia-bipolar-spectrum.",

    "abstract": "An animals diet is a crucial trait that defines their realised ecological niche, especially for dietary specialists such as the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), a threatened arboreal marsupial folivore. Unfortunately, the current methods used to characterise koala diet are labour intensive, biased and/or unreliable. Further, in this study we show that four barcoding genes (ITS, ETS, CCR and matK) are unable to resolve potential koala food trees to species. Therefore, we developed and tested a novel SNP-based method for the analysis of koala diet from faeces using the DArTseq platform. This method returned a large number of species-specific SNPs for candidate koala food tree species. Due to low within-species variation, few individuals of each tree species are needed to capture the majority of DArTseq SNP diversity. Nonetheless, we suggest sampling multiple trees to reduce the impact of high allele dropout rates in the DArTseq data. After identifying species-specific SNPs from candidate food tree species from two study sites with different assemblages of eucalypts we were able to detect those SNPs in koala faecal DNA using DArTag, a targeted genotyping assay. This enabled us to semi-quantitatively characterise the koalas diets. The food tree species identified were in broad agreement with previously known koala food tree species but also revealed additional species that may contribute to koala diet. This approach provides an important new tool for use in koala ecology and conservation and may prove useful in diet determination for other species where high taxonomic resolution is crucial and dietary DNA is scarce.",

Here, we customized the analytical approaches for the microalga-attached microbiotas from 110 diatom and 86 dinoflagellate samples to reveal key bacterial players and their ecological significance in the phycosphere. The results demonstrated a co-occurrence of host-specificity and conservation of phytoplankton-associated bacterial communities, defined 8 diatom- and 23 dinoflagellate-affiliated characteristic genera, as well as identifying 14 core genera prevalent with phytoplankton populations. Further classification of these 14 core genera into three tiers showed their distinct ecological features regarding occupancy, connectivity and community-stabilizing, whilst also matching their inherent metabolic properties. Our study redefines the archetypal phytoplankton-associated bacteria taxa more specifically up to the genus level, highlighting the significance of rarely noticed bacteria in the phycosphere, which is invaluable when selecting target bacteria for studying phytoplankton-bacteria interactions.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that Cas9-mediated CRISPR gene editing outcomes at junctions of chromosomal rearrangements are precise and predictable; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood due to lack of suitable assay system and analysis tool. Here we developed a customized computer program to take account of staggered Cas9 cleavage and to rapidly process large volumes of junctional sequencing reads from chromosomal rearrangements, including DNA-fragment inversions, duplications, and deletions. We also established a sensitive assay system using HPRT1 and DCK as reporters for cell growth during DNA-fragment editing by Cas9 with dual sgRNAs and found prominent large resections at junctions of chromosomal rearrangements. In addition, we found that knockdown of PolQ (encoding Pol{theta}) results in increased large resections but decreased small deletions. We also found that the mechanisms for generating small deletions of 1bp and >1bp during DNA-fragment editing are different with regards to their opposite dependencies on Pol{theta} and Pol{lambda}. Specifically, Pol{theta} suppresses 1bp deletions but promotes >1bp deletions, whereas Pol{lambda} promotes 1bp deletions but suppresses >1bp deletions. Finally, we found that Pol{lambda} is the main DNA polymerase responsible for fill-in of the 5 overhangs of staggered Cas9 cleavage ends. These findings contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DNA-fragment editing and have important implications for controllable, precise, and predictable gene editing.",

Recent studies reported that ribosome ubiquitination is crucial for translational regulation and ribosome-associated quality control (RQC). However, little is known about the dynamics of ribosome ubiquitination under complex biological processes of multicellular organisms. To explore ribosome ubiquitination during animal development, we generated a zebrafish strain that expresses a FLAG-tagged ribosomal protein Rpl36/eL36 from its endogenous locus. We examined ribosome ubiquitination during zebrafish development by combining affinity purification of ribosomes from rpl36-FLAG zebrafish embryos with immunoblotting analysis. Our findings showed that ubiquitination of ribosomal proteins dynamically changed as development proceeded. We also showed that during zebrafish development, the ribosome was ubiquitinated by Znf598, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that activates RQC. Ribosomal protein Rps10/eS10 was found to be a key ubiquitinated protein during development. Furthermore, we showed that Rps10/eS10 ubiquitination-site mutations reduced the overall ubiquitination pattern of ribosome. These results demonstrate the complexity and dynamics of ribosome ubiquitination during zebrafish development.",

Multiple mechanisms exist to ensure that apoptosis does not stimulate the immune system to cause inflammation or autoimmunity. Against this expectation, we now report epithelia are programmed to provoke, rather than suppress, inflammation in response to apoptosis. We found that an acute inflammatory response led by neutrophils occurs in zebrafish and cell culture when apoptotic epithelial cells cannot be expelled from the monolayer by apical extrusion. This reflects an intrinsic circuit where ATP released from apoptotic cells stimulates epithelial cells in the immediate vicinity to produce IL-8. As the epithelial barrier is compromised when apical extrusion fails, this juxta-apoptotic proinflammatory pathway may represent an early-response mechanism at sites of potential microbial ingress. Conversely, apical extrusion prevents inappropriate epithelial inflammation by physically eliminating apoptotic cells before they can activate this proinflammatory circuit.",

Snake venom glands are thought to share a common origin, but there are major distinctions between venom toxins from the medically significant snake families Elapidae and Viperidae, and toxin gene regulation in elapids is largely unexplored. Here, we used high-throughput RNA-sequencing to profile gene expression and microRNAs between active (milked) and resting (unmilked) venom glands in an elapid (Eastern Brown Snake, Pseudonaja textilis), in addition to comparative genomics, to identify cis- and trans- acting regulation of venom production in an elapid in comparison to viperids (Crotalus viridis and C. tigris). Although there is conservation in high-level mechanistic pathways regulating venom production, there are histone methylation, transcription factor, and microRNA regulatory differences between these two snake families. Histone methyltransferases (KMT2A, KMT2C and KMT2D) and transcription factor (TF) specificity protein 1 (Sp1) were highly upregulated in the milked elapid venom gland, whereas nuclear factor I (NFI) TFs were upregulated after viperid venom milking. Sp1 and NFI cis-regulatory elements were common to toxin gene promoter regions, but many unique elements were also present between elapid and viperid toxins. microRNA profiles were distinctive between milked and unmilked venom glands for both snake families, and microRNAs were predicted to target different toxin transcripts. Our comparative transcriptomic and genomic analyses between toxin genes and isoforms in elapid and viperid snakes suggests independent toxin evolution between these two snake families, demonstrating multiple toxin genes and regulatory mechanisms converged to underpin a highly venomous phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Ancestry tracts are contiguous haplotype blocks inherited from distinct groups of common ancestors. The genomic distribution of ancestry tracts (or local ancestry) provides rich information about evolutionary mechanisms shaping the genetic composition of hybrids. The correlation structure of ancestry tracts has been particularly useful in both empirical and theoretical studies, but there is a lack of descriptive measures operating on arbitrarily large genomic blocks to summarize this correlation structure without imposing too many assumptions about admixture. We here develop an approach inspired by quantum information theory to quantify this correlation structure. The key innovation is to represent local ancestry as quantum states, where less correlation in local ancestry leads to elevated quantum entropy. By leveraging a variety of entropy measures on local ancestry signals, we show that entropy is deeply connected to co-ancestry probabilities between and within haplotypes, so that ancestral recombination graphs become pivotal to the study of entropy dynamics in admixture. We use this approach to characterize a standard neutral admixture model with an arbitrary number of sources, and recover entropic laws governing the dynamics of ancestry tracts under recombination and genetic drift, which resembles the second law of thermodynamics. In application, entropy is well-defined on arbitrarily large genomic blocks with either phased or unphased local ancestry, and is insensitive to a small amount of noise. These properties are superior to simple statistics on ancestry tracts such as tract length and junction density. Finally, we construct an entropic index reflecting the degree of intermixing among ancestry tracts over a chromosomal block. This index confirms that the Z chromosome in a previously studied butterfly hybrid zone has the least potential of ancestry mixing, thus conforming to the \"large-X/Z\" effect in speciation. Together, we show that quantum entropy provides a useful framework for studying ancestry tract dynamics in both theories and real systems.",

Among these transcripts, some are newly transcribed when compared to outgroups and are referred to as de novo transcripts. De novo transcripts have been shown to play a major role in de novo gene emergence. However, little is known about the rates at which de novo transcripts are gained and lost in individuals of the same species. Here, we address this gap and estimate for the first time the de novo transcript turnover rate. We use DNA long reads and RNA short reads from seven samples of inbred individuals of Drosophila melanogaster to detect de novo transcripts that are (transiently) gained on a short evolutionary time scale. Overall, each sampled individual contains between 2,320 and 2,809 unspliced de novo transcripts with most of them being sample specific. We estimate that around 0.15 transcripts are gained per year, and that each gained transcript is lost at a rate around 5x10-5 per year. This high turnover of transcripts suggests frequent exploration of new genomic sequences within species. These rates provide first empirical estimates to better predict and comprehend the process of de novo gene birth.",

    "abstract": "Brain age is a quantitative estimate to explain an individuals structural and functional brain measurements relative to the overall population and is particularly valuable in describing differences related to developmental or neurodegenerative pathology. Accurately inferring brain age from brain imaging data requires sophisticated models that capture the underlying age-related brain changes. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a phase contrast MRI technology that uses external palpations to measure brain mechanical properties. Mechanical property measures of viscoelastic shear stiffness and damping ratio have been found to change across the entire life span and to reflect brain health due to neurodegenerative diseases and even individual differences in cognitive function. Here we develop and train a multi-modal 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to model the relationship between age and whole brain mechanical properties. After training, the network maps the measurements and other inputs to a brain age prediction. We found high performance using the 3D maps of various mechanical properties to predict brain age. Stiffness maps alone were able to predict ages of the test group subjects with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.76 years, which is comparable to single inputs of damping ratio (MAE: 3.82) and outperforms single input of volume (MAE: 4.60). Combining stiffness and volume in a multimodal approach performed the best, with an MAE of 3.60 years, whereas including damping ratio worsened model performance. Our results reflect previous MRE literature that had demonstrated that stiffness is more strongly related to chronological age than damping ratio. This machine learning model provides the first prediction of brain age from brain biomechanical data--an advancement towards sensitively describing brain integrity differences in individuals with neuropathology.",

In adult muscle nicotinic receptors, efficiencies estimated from 76 concentration-response curves (23 agonists, 53 mutations) segregate into 5 discrete classes (%): 0.56 (17), 0.51(32), 0.45(13), 0.41(26) and 0.31(12). There is a strong linear correlation between affinity and efficacy within each class, but the multiplicity of classes precludes the appearance of any overall relationship.

In the canonical conserved Hippo pathway, known to play a complex role in regulating growth of cancer cells, the protein kinases MST1/2 and LATS1/2 act sequentially to phosphorylate and inhibit the YAP/TAZ transcription factors. We found that in the MCF10A mammary epithelial cell line as well as in squamous and breast cancer cell lines, expression of {Delta}Np63 RNA and protein is strongly repressed by inhibition of the Hippo pathway protein kinases in a manner that is independent of p53. While MST1/2 and LATS1 are required for p63 expression, the next step of the pathway, namely phosphorylation and degradation of the YAP/TAZ transcriptional activators is not required for repression of p63. This suggests that regulation of p63 expression occurs by a non-canonical version of the Hippo pathway. We additionally identified additional genes that were similarly regulated suggesting the broader importance of this pathway. Interestingly, we observed that experimentally lowering p63 expression leads to increased YAP protein levels, thereby constituting a feedback loop. These results, which reveal the intersection of the Hippo and p63 pathways, may prove useful for the control of their activities in cancer cells.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryRegulation of p63 expression occurs by a non-canonical version of the Hippo pathway in mammary epithelial, breast carcinoma and head and neck squamous carcinoma cells",

    "abstract": "The process of cellular senescence, which is characterized by stable cell cycle arrest, is strongly associated with dysfunctional cellular metabolism and circadian rhythmicity, both of which are reported to result from and also be causal to cellular senescence. As a result, modifying any of them - senescence, metabolism, or the circadian clock - may affect all three simultaneously. Obesity accelerates aging by disrupting the homeostasis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via an increased mitochondrial burden of fatty acid oxidation. As a result, if senescence, metabolism, and circadian rhythm are all linked, anti-obesity treatments may improve metabolic regulation while also alleviating senescence and circadian rhythm. Vutiglabridin is a small molecule in clinical trials that improves obesity by enhancing mitochondrial function. We found that chronic treatment of senescent primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) with vutiglabridin alleviates all investigated markers of cellular senescence (SA-{beta}-gal, CDKN1A, CDKN2A) and dysfunctional cellular circadian rhythm (BMAL1), while remarkably preventing the alterations of mitochondrial function and structure that occur during the process of cellular senescence. Our results demonstrate the significant senescence-alleviating effects of vutiglabridin, specifically with the restoration of cellular circadian rhythmicity and metabolic regulation. These data support the potential development of vutiglabridin against aging-associated diseases and corroborate the intricate link between cellular senescence, metabolism, and the circadian clock.",

They are responsible for water and nutrient uptake, as well as for interacting with biotic and abiotic factors in the soil. The root system architecture (RSA) and its plasticity are crucial for resource acquisition and consequently correlate with plant performance, while being highly dependent on the surrounding environment, such as soil properties and therefore environmental conditions.\n\nThus, especially for crop plants and regarding agricultural challenges, it is essential to perform molecular and phenotypic analyses of the root system under conditions as near as possible to nature (#asnearaspossibletonature). To prevent root illumination during experimental procedures, which would heavily affect root development, dark-root (D-Root) devices (DRDs) have been developed. In this article, we describe the construction and different applications of a sustainable, affordable, flexible, and easy to assemble open-hardware bench-top LEGO(R) DRD, the DRD-BIBLOX (Brick Black Box).\n\nThe DRD-BIBLOX consists of one or more 3D-printed rhizoboxes which can be filled with soil, while still providing root visibility.

Additionally, we confirmed the significant effect of root illumination on barley root and shoot phenotypes. Our data therefore reinforces the importance of the application of field conditions in the lab and the value of our novel device, the DRD-BIBLOX.\n\nWe further provide a DRD-BIBLOX application spectrum, spanning from investigating a variety of plant species and soil conditions as well as simulating different environmental conditions and stresses, to proteomic and phenotypic analyses, including early root tracking in the dark.",

    "abstract": "Pair-wise co-mutation networks of the mitochondrial genome have already provided ample evidences about the roles of genetic interactions in the manifestation of phenotype under altered environmental conditions. Here, we present a method to construct and analyze higher-order interactions, namely, 3-uniform hypergraphs of the mitochondrial genome for different altitude populations to decipher the role of co-mutating variable sites beyond pair-wise interactions. While the weights distribution of such gene hyperedges manifested power-law for all the altitudes, we identified altitude-specific genes based on gene hyperedge weight. This framework of hypergraphs serves a promising avenue for future investigation of nuclear genomes in context of phenotypic association and genetic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Feedback connections between tissue stiffness and cellular contractile forces can instruct cell identity and activity via a process referred to as mechanosensing. Specific phosphoproteome changes during mechanosensing are poorly characterized. In this work, we chart the global phosphoproteome dynamics of primary human lung fibroblasts sensing the stiffness of injury relevant fibronectin coated Poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrates. We discovered a key signaling threshold at a Youngs modulus of eight kPa stiffness, above which cells activated a large number of pathways including RhoA, CK2A1, PKA, AMPK, AKT1, and Hippo-YAP1/TAZ mediated signaling. Time-resolved phosphoproteomics of cell spreading on stiff substrates revealed the temporal dynamics of these stiffness-sensitive signaling pathways. ECM substrate stiffness above eight kPA induced fibroblast contractility, cytoskeletal rearrangements, ECM secretion, and a fibroblast to myofibroblast transition. Our data indicate that phosphorylation of the transcriptional regulator NFATC4 at S213/S217 enhances myofibroblast activity, which is the key hallmark of fibrotic diseases. NFATC4 knock down cells display reduced stiffness induced collagen secretion, cell contractility, nuclear deformation and invasion, suggesting NFATC4 as a novel target for antifibrotic therapy.\n\nSynopsisHow tissue stiffness regulates identity and activity of tissue fibroblasts is unclear.

    "abstract": "Circadian clocks are endogenous oscillators present in almost all cells that drive daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. There are two mechanisms that have been proposed to explain how circadian rhythms are generated in mammalian cells: through a transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL) and based on oxidation/reduction reactions, both of which are intrinsically stochastic and heterogeneous at the single cell level. In order to explore the emerging properties of stochastic and heterogeneous redox oscillators, we simplify a recently developed kinetic model of redox oscillations to an amplitude-phase oscillator with  twist (period-amplitude correlation) and subject to Gaussian noise. We show that noise and heterogeneity alone lead to fast desynchronization, and that coupling between noisy oscillators can establish robust and synchronized rhythms with amplitude expansions and tuning of the period due to twist. Coupling a network of redox oscillators to a simple model of the TTFL also contributes to synchronization, large amplitudes and fine-tuning of the period for appropriate interaction strengths. These results provide insights into how the circadian clock compensates randomness from intracellular sources and highlight the importance of noise, heterogeneity and coupling in the context of circadian oscillators.",

Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, a master regulator of immunity and tolerance, also highly express Lag3. While Lag3 is thought to be necessary for Treg cell-mediated regulation of immunity, the precise roles and underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. In this study, we report that Lag3 is indispensable for Treg cells to control autoimmune inflammation. Utilizing a newly generated Treg cell specific Lag3 mutant mouse model, we found that these animals are highly susceptible to autoimmune diseases, suggesting defective Treg cell function. Genome wide transcriptome analysis further uncovered that Lag3 mutant Treg cells upregulated genes involved in metabolic processes. Mechanistically, we found that Lag3 limits Treg cell expression of Myc, a key regulator of aerobic glycolysis. We further found that Lag3-dependent Myc expression determines Treg cells metabolic programming as well as the in vivo function to suppress autoimmune inflammation. Taken together, our results uncovered a novel function of Lag3 in supporting Treg cell suppressive function by regulating Myc-dependent metabolic programming.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections can include bacterial survival inside epithelial cells. Previously, we showed this involves multiple roles played by the type three-secretion system (T3SS), and specifically the effector ExoS. This includes ExoS-dependent inhibition of a lytic host cell response that subsequently enables intracellular replication. Here, we studied the underlying cell death response to intracellular P. aeruginosa, comparing wild-type to T3SS mutants varying in capacity to induce cell death and that localize to different intracellular compartments. Results showed that corneal epithelial cell death induced by intracellular P. aeruginosa lacking the T3SS, which remains in vacuoles, correlated with activation of NF-{kappa}B as measured by p65 relocalization and TNF transcription and secretion. Deletion of caspase-4 through CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis delayed cell death caused by these intracellular T3SS mutants. Caspase-4 deletion also countered more rapid cell death caused by T3SS effector-null mutants still expressing the TSSS apparatus that traffic to the host cell cytoplasm, and in doing so rescued intracellular replication normally dependent on ExoS. While HeLa cells lacked a lytic death response to T3SS mutants, it was found to be enabled by interferon gamma treatment. Together, these results show that epithelial cells can activate the noncanonical inflammasome pathway to limit proliferation of intracellular P. aeruginosa, not fully dependent on bacterially-driven vacuole escape. Since ExoS inhibits the lytic response, the data implicate targeting of caspase-4, an intracellular pattern recognition receptor, as another contributor to the role of ExoS in the intracellular lifestyle of P. aeruginosa.\n\nImportancePseudomonas aeruginosa can exhibit an intracellular lifestyle within epithelial cells in vivo and in vitro. The type three secretion system (T3SS) effector ExoS contributes via multiple mechanisms, including extending the life of invaded host cells. Here, we aimed to understand the underlying cell death inhibited by ExoS when P. aeruginosa is intracellular. Results showed that intracellular P. aeruginosa lacking T3SS effectors could elicit rapid cell lysis via the non-canonical inflammasome pathway. Caspase-4 contributed to cell lysis even when the intracellular bacteria lacked the entire T33S and were consequently unable to escape vacuoles, representing a naturally occurring subpopulation during wildtype infection. Together, the data show the caspase-4 inflammasome as an epithelial cell defense against intracellular P. aeruginosa, and implicate its targeting as another mechanism by which ExoS preserves the host cell replicative niche.",

    "abstract": "A better understanding of dysbiosis is a major goal of human microbiome studies, but more knowledge about chemical effects on microbial communities is needed. Oxidation-reduction and hydration-dehydration reactions are chemical processes that are important for physiological functions and, it is hypothesized here, may also influence the elemental composition of microbial proteins. Chemical metrics of biomolecules relevant to these processes are carbon oxidation state (ZC) and stoichiometric hydration state [Formula]. I calculated these metrics for protein sequences derived from microbial genomes (multiplied by 16S rRNA-based taxonomic abundances to obtain community reference proteomes), shotgun metagenomes, and metaproteomes. Metaproteomes of gut communities are reduced (i.e., have lower ZC) compared to oral communities. In contrast, community reference proteomes have lower [Formula] in gut compared to nasal, skin, and oral communities, and metagenomes for gut and oral communities exhibit the same trend. The chemical differences for metaproteomes may be explained by physiological adjustment of protein expression levels to anaerobic, reducing conditions in the gut, whereas metagenomes and reference proteomes may reflect evolutionary adaptation to dehydrating conditions brought on by intestinal absorption of water. Community reference proteomes, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), and metaproteomes compiled from various studies yield a common trend of more reduced proteins in gut communities of COVID-19 patients compared to controls. These chemical differences imply more reducing conditions in the guts of COVID-19 patients, a finding that contrasts with oxidative conditions that have been previously associated with dysbiosis in inflammatory bowel disease and HIV infection. These results reveal how the human microbiome is shaped by multiple chemical factors over a range of timescales and suggest a new strategy for using multi-omics data to infer changes in gut redox conditions in COVID-19 patients.",

Previous studies have suggested dopamine and glutamate neurotransmission genes, as well as immune function alteration as genetic risk factors. Schizophrenia epidemiology, symptomatology and outcomes are different for women and men, but the biological reason is not understood. Therefore, we reviewed all RNA-sequencing studies of post-mortem brain samples of women and men affected by schizophrenia available. Then, we compared the gene expression on each study for males and females and integrated the results of studies on different regions meta-analyses: prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and all-studies.

    "abstract": "Global amphibian populations are declining, and invasive fish are known to impact many threatened species. South Africa has both a biodiverse amphibian fauna and a rich history of invasive fish introductions with high establishment success. Studies have identified some preliminary evidence for negative impacts of invasive salmonids on two ghost frog species (Anura: Heleophrynidae). This study aims to investigate whether these negative impacts previously reported are reflected across a broader scale. Tadpoles of two species, Heleophryne regis and H. purcelli were sampled in the presence and absence of invasive fish at 112 sites across 26 streams in the Western Cape province of South Africa. A generalised linear mixed model showed invasive fish to have the most significant negative effect explaining tadpole abundance. Mean tadpole abundance decreases by 18 times in the presence of invasive fish. Environmental variables with significant effects on tadpole abundance include pH, oxygen saturation, temperature, stream depth and non-native riparian vegetation type. We can define an environmental niche of ghost frog tadpoles which does not differ between species. We conclude that invasive fish have significant negative impacts on ghost frog tadpole abundance, but the effect of the environment should not be overlooked in amphibian conservation planning and invasive species management decisions. This study supports the removal of invasive fish and alien vegetation to improve the conservation of ghost frogs.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the copy number of large genomic regions, termed copy number variations or CNVs, are an important adaptive strategy for malaria parasites. Numerous CNVs across the Plasmodium falciparum genome contribute directly to drug resistance or impact fitness of this protozoan parasite. CNVs that encompass the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) gene confer resistance to antimalarials that target this enzyme in the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (i.e. DSM1). During the characterization of DSM1 resistant parasite lines with DHODH CNVs, we detected selection of an additional CNV that encompasses 3 genes (~5 kb) including GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH1 amplicon). While this locus has been implicated in increased fitness of antifolate resistant parasites, GCH1 CNVs had not previously been reported to contribute to resistance to other antimalarials. Here, we further explored the association between GCH1 and DHODH copy number. We visualized single long reads and directly quantified the number of tandem GCH1 amplicons in a parental line versus a DSM1-selected line. We found that the GCH1 amplicons share a consistent structure in all lines. However, we detected more reads that encompassed a higher number of amplicons in the resistant (up to 7 amplicons) compared to the parental line (3 amplicons). To better understand the implications of this result, we evaluated variation at this locus across multiple short- and long-read data sets collected from various parasite lines. Based on our analysis of parasites resistant to other DHODH inhibitors (DSM265, DSM267, and DSM705), GCH1 is not likely contributing directly to resistance; however, higher numbers of the GCH1 amplicon are associated with increased DHODH copies and may compensate for changes in metabolism of parasites. This is supported by the direct connection between folate and pyrimidine metabolism, which together contribute to nucleic acid biosynthesis. This study highlights the importance of studying clonal variation and potential biochemical connections as novel antimalarials move closer to clinical approval.",

    "abstract": "Pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP), a phosphorylated form of vitamin B6, acts as a coenzyme for numerous reactions, including those changed in cancer and/or associated with the disease prognosis. Since highly reactive PLP may modify cellular proteins, it is hypothesized to be directly transferred from its donors to acceptors. Our goal is to validate the hypothesis by finding common motif(s) in a multitude of the PLP-dependent enzymes for binding the limited number of the PLP donors, namely pyridoxal kinase (PdxK), pyridox(am)in-5-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) and the PLP-binding protein (PLPBP). Experimentally confirmed interactions between the PLP donors and acceptors reveal that PdxK and PNPO interact with the PLP acceptors of folds I and II, while PLPBP - with those of folds III and V. Aligning the sequences and 3D structures of the identified interactors of PdxK and PNPO, we have found a common motif in the PLP-dependent enzymes of folds I and II. The motif extends from the enzyme surface to the neighborhood of the PLP binding site, represented by an exposed alfa-helix, a partially buried beta-strand and residual loops. Pathogenicity of mutations in human PLP-dependent enzymes within or in the vicinity of the motif, but outside of the active sites, supports functional significance of the motif that may provide an interface for the direct transfer of PLP from the sites of its synthesis to those of the coenzyme binding. The enzyme-specific amino acid residues of the common motif may be useful to develop selective inhibitors blocking PLP delivery to the PLP-dependent enzymes critical for proliferation of malignant cells.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial genus Rhodococcus comprises organisms that perform an oleaginous behavior under certain growth conditions and the ratio of carbon and nitrogen availability. Thus, Rhodococcus spp have outstanding biotechnological features as microbial producers of biofuel precursors, which would be used instead of lipids from crops. It was postulated that lipid and glycogen metabolism in Rhodococci are closely related. Thus, a better understanding of rhodococcal carbon partitioning requires identifying the catalytic steps redirecting sugar moieties to temporal storage molecules, such as glycogen and trehalose. In this work, we analyzed two glycosyl-transferases GT4 from R. jostii, RjoGlgAb and RjoGlgAc, which were annotated as -glucan--1,4-glucosyl transferases, putatively involved in glycogen synthesis. Both enzymes were recombinantly produced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells, purified to near homogeneity, and kinetically characterized. RjoGlgAb and RjoGlgAc presented the \"canonical\" glycogen synthase (EC 2.4.1.21) activity. Besides, both enzymes were actives as maltose-1P synthases (GlgM, EC 2.4.1.342), although to a different extent. In this scenario, RjoGlgAc is a homologous enzyme to the mycobacterial GlgM, with similar behavior regarding kinetic parameters and glucosyl-donor (ADP-glucose) preference. RjoGlgAc was two orders of magnitude more efficient to glucosylate glucose-1P than glycogen. Also, this rhodococcal enzyme used glucosamine-1P as a catalytically efficient aglycon. On the other hand, both activities exhibited by RjoGlgAb depicted similar kinetic efficiency and a preference for short-branched -1,4-glucans. Curiously, RjoGlgAb presented a super-oligomeric conformation (higher than 15 subunits), representing a novel enzyme with a unique structure to function relationships. Results presented herein constitute a milestone regarding polysaccharide biosynthesis in Actinobacteria, leading to (re)discovery of methyl-glucose lipo-polysaccharide metabolism in Rhodococci.",

Patient-specific computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations reveal detailed hemodynamic information, but their agreement with the clinical standard 4D-Flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) needs to be characterized. This work directly compares in vivo CFD fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations against 4D-Flow MRI in patients with CoA (N=5). 4D-Flow MRI-derived flow waveforms and cuff blood pressure measurements were used to tune the boundary conditions for the FSI simulations. Flow rates from 4D-Flow MRI and FSI were compared at cross-sections in the ascending aorta (AAo), CoA and descending aorta (DAo). Qualitative comparisons showed an overall agreement of flow patterns in the aorta between the two methods. The R2 values for the flow waveforms in the AAo, CoA, and DAo were 0.97, 0.84 and 0.81 respectively, representing a strong correlation between 4DFlow MRI measurements and FSI results.

    "abstract": "Antivirals are indispensable tools that can be targeted at viral domains directly or indirectly at cellular domains to obstruct viral infections and reduce pathogenicity. Despite their transformative use in healthcare, antivirals have been clinically approved to treat only 10 of the more than 200 known pathogenic human viruses. Additionally, many virus functions are intimately coupled with host cellular processes, which present challenges in antiviral development due to the limited number of clear targets per virus, necessitating an extensive insight into these molecular processes. Compounding this challenge, many viral pathogens have evolved to evade effective antivirals. We hypothesize that a Viral Attachment Blocking Chimera (VirABloC) composed of a viral binder and a bulky scaffold that sterically blocks interactions between a viral particle and a host cell may be suitable for the development of antivirals agnostic to the extravirion epitope that is being bound. We test this hypothesis by modifying a nanobody that specifically recognizes a non-essential epitope presented on the extra virion surface of Pseudorabies virus strain 486 with a 3-dimensional wireframe DNA origami structure [~]100 nm in diameter. The nanobody switches from having no inhibitory properties (tested up to 50 {micro}M) to 4.2 {+/-} 0.9 nM IC50 when conjugated with the DNA origami scaffold. Mechanistic studies support that inhibition is mediated by the non-covalent attachment of the DNA origami scaffold to the virus particle, which obstructs the attachment of the viruses onto host cells. These results support the potential of VirABloC as a generalizable approach to developing antivirals.",

    "abstract": "Barcoded mutant libraries are a powerful tool for elucidating gene function in microbes, particularly when screened in multiple growth conditions. Here, we screened a pooled CRISPR interference library of the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in 11 bioreactor-controlled conditions, spanning multiple light regimes and carbon sources. This gene repression library contained 21,705 individual mutants with high redundancy over all open reading frames and non-coding RNAs. Comparison of the derived gene fitness scores revealed multiple instances of gene repression being beneficial in one condition while generally detrimental in others, particularly for genes within light harvesting and conversion, such as antennae components at high light and PSII subunits during photoheterotrophy. Suboptimal regulation of such genes likely represents a tradeoff of reduced growth speed for enhanced robustness to perturbation. The extensive dataset assigns condition-specific importance to many previously unannotated genes, and suggests new functions for central metabolic enzymes. Prk, GAPDH, and CP12 were critical for mixotrophy and photoheterotrophy, which implicates the ternary complex as important for redirecting metabolic flux in these conditions in addition to inactivation of the Calvin cycle in the dark. To predict the potency of sgRNA sequences, we applied machine learning on sgRNA sequences and gene repression data, which showed the importance of C enrichment and T depletion in the first 12 bp proximal to the PAM site. Fitness data for all genes in all conditions is compiled in an interactive web application.",

    "abstract": "The malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax remains a major global public health challenge, causing major morbidity across tropical and subtropical regions. Several candidate vaccines are in preclinical and clinical trials, however no vaccine against P. vivax malaria is approved for use in humans. Here we assessed whether P. vivax strain-transcendent immunity can be achieved by repeated infection in Aotus monkeys. For this purpose, we repeatedly infected six animals with blood stages of the P. vivax Salvador 1 (SAL-1) strain until sterile immune, and then challenged with the AMRU-1 strain. Sterile immunity was achieved in 4/4 (100%) Aotus monkeys after two homologous infections with the SAL-1 strain, while partial protection against a heterologous AMRU-1 challenge was achieved in 3/3 (100%) monkeys. IgG levels based on P. vivax lysate ELISA and protein microarray increased with repeated infections and correlated with the level of homologous protection. Analysis of parasite transcriptional profiles across inoculation levels provided no evidence of major antigenic switching upon homologous or heterologous challenge. In contrast, we observed significant transcriptional differences in the P. vivax core gene repertoire between SAL-1 and AMRU-1. Together with the strain-specific genetic diversity between SAL-1 and AMRU-1 these data suggest that the protection upon heterologous challenge is due to strain differences (at genome and transcriptome level) rather than immune evasion by antigenic switching. Our study provides the first benchmark for achieving sterile immunity in the Aotus/P. vivax non-human primate model, and a template for establishing correlates of immunity to test the efficacy of candidate blood stage P. vivax malaria vaccines.\n\nAuthor summaryPlasmodium vivax is the most widespread human malaria parasite. Elimination efforts are complicated due to the peculiar biology of P. vivax including dormant liver forms, cryptic reservoirs in bone marrow and spleen and a large asymptomatic infectious reservoir in affected populations. Currently there is no vaccine against malaria caused by P. vivax. Here we induce sterile immunity by repeated P. vivax infection with the SAL-1 strain in non-human primates. In contrast, heterologous challenge with the AMRU-1 strain only provided partial protection. Antibody levels against a crude antigen and a protein microarray correlated with the level of homologous protection. Parasite transcriptional profiles across inoculation levels failed to show major antigenic switching across SAL-1 infections or upon heterologous challenge, instead suggesting other mechanisms of immune evasion. Our study provides the first benchmark for achieving sterile immunity in the Aotus/P. vivax non-human primate model, and a template for establishing correlates of immunity to test the efficacy of candidate blood stage P. vivax malaria vaccines.",

This study aimed to evaluate fecundity, fertility, survival, longevity, and blood feeding activity in Ae. aegypti after exposure to ZIKV and CHIKV and, in Cx. quinquefasciatusexposed to ZIKV.Three colonies were evaluated: AeCamp(Ae. aegypti -field),RecL (Ae. aegypti - laboratory)and CqSLab (Cx. quinquefasciatus - laboratory). Seven to 10 days-old females from these colonies were exposed to artificial blood feeding with CHIKV or ZIKV. CHIKV caused reduction in fecundity and fertilityinthe natural population, AeCamp and reduction in survival and fertility in RecL.ZIKV impacted survival in RecL, fertility in AeCamp. and fecundity and fertility in CqSLab. Both viruses had no effect on blood feeding activity. These results show that CHIKV produces a higher biological cost in Ae. aegypti, compared to ZIKV, and ZIKV differently alters the biological performance in colonies of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus. These results provide a better understanding over the processes of virus-vector interaction and can shed light on the complexity of arbovirus transmission.",

    "abstract": "Anthrax, caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, is a zoonotic disease that manifests in various forms in human infection, depending on the route of infection. Inhalation anthrax, the most detrimental form of the disease, comes about from the inhalation of anthrax spores and progresses to severe life-threatening conditions late in infection. Notably, there are FDA-approved antibiotics that are effective at treating the disease when administered promptly; however, these antibiotics would be rendered useless against strains of B. anthracis that were genetically modified to be resistant to these antibiotics. Consequently, the search for new and effective therapeutics to combat anthrax infection continues. In this study, telavancin (Vibativ(R)), a semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, was assessed for in vitro activity against 17 B. anthracis strains and tested for the protective efficacy against inhalation anthrax infection in the rabbit model. Telavancin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against B. anthracis which led us to test its efficacy in the rabbit inhalation anthrax model. Rabbits were infected with a lethal dose of anthrax spores via the inhalation route and treated intravenously with telavancin at 30 mg/kg every 12 hours, a dose that mimics the levels measured in the serum of humans, for 5 days upon detection of antigenemia. Blood samples were collected at various times post-infection to assess the level of bacteremia and antibody production, and tissues were collected to determine bacterial load. The animals body temperatures were also recorded. Telavancin conveyed 100% survival in this model. Moreover, the dosage of telavancin used for the study effectively cleared B. anthracis from the bloodstream and organ tissues, even more effectively than a humanized dose of levofloxacin. Collectively, the low MICs against all strains tested and rapid bactericidal in vivo activity demonstrate that telavancin has the potential to be an effective alternative for the treatment or prophylaxis of anthrax infection.\n\nAuthor SummaryBacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, continues to interest the research community due to its past and future potential use as bioweapon. Importantly, as a bacterial pathogen, B. anthracis is capable of developing resistance to the antibiotics currently used to treat the infection, either naturally or by deliberate, nefarious means. Consequently, there remains a need to discover, develop, and/or repurpose new antibiotics that would be effective at treating anthrax infection. In this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity of telavancin, a semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotic clinically approved to treat complicated skin and skin structure infections, against various strains of B. anthracis in vitro, and we assessed the protective efficacy of telavancin against inhalation anthrax infection in the rabbit model. We show that telavancin is very potent against numerous B. anthracis strains in vitro, and its level of potency surpassed that of another antibiotic currently approved and used to prevent anthrax infection. Moreover, we show that telavancin protects against inhalation anthrax infection in vivo. Overall, our findings support the use of telavancin as an effective therapeutic for anthrax infection.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a tightly regulated catabolic process involved in the degradation and re-cycling of proteins and organelles. Ubiquitination plays an important role in the regulation of autophagy. Vacuole Membrane Protein 1 (VMP1) is an essential autophagy protein. The expression of VMP1 in pancreatic cancer stem cells carrying the activated Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) triggers autophagy and enables therapy resistance. Using biochemical and cellular approaches, we identified ubiquitination as a post-translational modification of VMP1 from the initial steps in autophagosome biogenesis. VMP1 remains ubiquitinated as part of the autophagosome membrane throughout autophagic flux until autolysosome formation. However, VMP1 is not degraded by autophagy, nor by the ubiquitin-proteasomal system. Mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation showed that the cell division cycle protein cdt2 (Cdt2), the substrate recognition subunit of the E3 ligase complex associated with cancer, cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex 4 (CRL4), is a novel interactor of VMP1 and is involved in VMP1 ubiquitination. VMP1 ubiquitination decreases under the CRL inhibitor MLN4924 and increases with Cdt2 overexpression. Moreover, VMP1 recruitment and autophagosome formation is significantly affected by CRL inhibition. Our results indicate that ubiquitination is a novel post-translational modification of VMP1 during autophagy in human tumor cells. VMP1 ubiquitination may be of clinical relevance in tumor cell therapy resistance.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=68 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/528037v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a1538dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@74580corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@409ef0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@82b856_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Chromatin remodeling complexes are required for many distinct nuclear processes such as transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair. However, how these complexes contribute to the development of complex tissues within an organism is poorly characterized. Imitation switch (ISWI) proteins are among the most evolutionarily conserved ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors and are represented by yeast Isw1/Isw2, and their vertebrate counterparts Snf2h (Smarca5) and Snf2l (Smarca1). In this study, we focused on the role of the Snf2h gene during development of the mammalian retina. We show that Snf2h is expressed in both retinal progenitors and post-mitotic retinal cells. Using Snf2h conditional knockout mice (Snf2h cKO), we found that when Snf2h is deleted the laminar structure of the adult retina is not retained, the overall thickness of the retina is significantly reduced compared with controls, and the outer nuclear layer (ONL) is completely missing. Depletion of Snf2h did not influence the ability of retinal progenitors to generate all of the differentiated retinal cell types. Instead, Snf2h function is critical for proliferation of retinal progenitor cells. Cells lacking Snf2h have a defective S-phase, leading to the entire cell division process impairments. Although, all retinal cell types appear to be specified in the absence of Snf2h function, cell cycle defects and concomitantly increased apoptosis in Snf2h cKO result in abnormal retina lamination, complete destruction of the photoreceptor layer and, consequently, in a physiologically non-functional retina.",

    "abstract": "In eutherian mammals, hundreds of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generated at the onset of meiosis. The DNA damage response is then triggered. Although the dynamics of this response is well studied in eutherian mammals, recent findings have revealed different patterns of DNA damage signaling and repair in marsupial mammals. To better characterize these differences, here we analyzed synapsis and the chromosomal distribution of meiotic DSBs markers in three different marsupial species (Thylamys elegans, Dromiciops gliorides, and Macropus eugenii) that represent South American and Australian Orders. Our results revealed inter-specific differences in the chromosomal distribution of DNA damage and repair proteins, which were associated with differing synapsis patterns. In the American species T. elegans and D. gliroides, synapsis progressed exclusively from the chromosomal ends towards interstitial regions. This was accompanied by sparse H2AX phosphorylation, mainly accumulating at chromosomal ends, which appeared conspicuously polarized in a bouquet configuration at early stages of prophase I. Accordingly, RAD51 and RPA were mainly localized at chromosomal ends throughout prophaseI in both American marsupials, likely resulting in reduced recombination rates at interstitial positions. In sharp contrast, synapsis initiated at both interstitial and distal chromosomal regions in the Australian representative M. eugenii, {gamma}H2AX had a broad nuclear distribution, and RAD51 and RPA foci displayed an even chromosomal distribution. Given the basal evolutionary position of T. elegans, it is likely that the meiotic features reported in this species represent an ancestral pattern in marsupials and that a shift in the meiotic program occurred after the split of D. gliroides and the Australian marsupial clade. Our results open intriguing questions about the regulation and homeostasis of meiotic DSBs in marsupials. The low recombination rates observed at the interstitial chromosomal regions in American marsupials can result in the formation of large linkage groups, thus having an impact in the evolution of their genomes.",

    "abstract": "Mutations affecting enhancer chromatin regulators CREBBP and KMT2D are highly co-occurrent in germinal center (GC)-derived lymphomas and other tumors, even though regulating similar pathways. Herein, we report that combined haploinsufficiency of Crebbp and Kmt2d (C+K) indeed accelerated lymphomagenesis. C+K haploinsufficiency induced GC hyperplasia by altering cell fate decisions, skewing B cells away from memory and plasma cell differentiation. C+K deficiency particularly impaired enhancer activation for immune synapse genes involved in exiting the GC reaction. This effect was especially severe at super-enhancers for immunoregulatory and differentiation genes. Mechanistically, CREBBP and KMT2D formed a complex, were highly co-localized on chromatin, and were required for each-others stable recruitment to enhancers. Notably, C+K lymphomas in mice and humans manifested significantly reduced CD8+ T-cell abundance. Hence, deficiency of C+K cooperatively induced an immune evasive phenotype due at least in part to failure to activate key immune synapse super-enhancers, associated with altered immune cell fate decisions.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEAlthough CREBBP and KMT2D have similar enhancer regulatory functions, they are paradoxically co-mutated in lymphomas. We show that their combined loss causes specific disruption of super-enhancers driving immune synapse genes. Importantly, this leads to reduction of CD8 cells in lymphomas, linking super-enhancer function to immune surveillance, with implications for immunotherapy resistance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenetic and experimental evidence strongly implicates myeloid cells in the etiology of AD and suggests that AD-associated alleles and genes may modulate disease risk by altering the transcriptional and cellular responses of macrophages (like microglia) to damage of lipid-rich tissues (like the brain). Specifically, recent single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing (sc/nRNA-seq) studies identified a transcriptionally distinct state of subsets of macrophages in aging or degenerating brains (usually referred to as disease- associated microglia or DAM) and in other diseased lipid-rich tissues (e.g., obese adipose tissue, fatty liver, and atherosclerotic plaques). We collectively refer to these subpopulations as lipid-associated macrophages or LAMs. Importantly, this particular activation state is characterized by increased expression of genes involved in the phagocytic clearance of lipid-rich cellular debris (efferocytosis), including several AD risk genes.\n\nMethodsWe used sc/nRNA-seq data from human and mouse microglia from healthy and diseased brains and macrophages from other lipid-rich tissues to reconstruct gene regulatory networks and identify transcriptional regulators whose regulons are enriched for LAM response genes (LAM TFs) across species. We then used gene knock- down/knock-out strategies to validate some of these LAM TFs in human THP-1 macrophages and iPSC-derived microglia in vitro, as well as mouse microglia in vivo.\n\nResultsWe nominate 11 strong candidate LAM TFs shared across human and mouse networks (BHLHE41, HIF1A, ID2, JUNB, MAF, MAFB, MEF2A, MEF2C, NACA, POU2F2 and SPI1). We also demonstrate a strong enrichment of AD risk alleles in the cistrome of BHLHE41 (and its close homolog BHLHE40), thus implicating its regulon in the modulation of disease susceptibility. Loss or reduction of BHLHE40/41 expression in human THP-1 macrophages and iPSC-derived microglia, as well as loss of Bhlhe40/41 in mouse microglia led to increased expression of LAM response genes, specifically those involved in cholesterol clearance and lysosomal processing, with a concomitant increase in cholesterol efflux and storage, as well as lysosomal mass and degradative capacity.\n\nConclusionsTaken together, this study nominates transcriptional regulators of the LAM response, experimentally validates BHLHE40/41 in human and mouse macrophages/microglia, and provides novel targets for therapeutic modulation of macrophage/microglia function in AD and other disorders of lipid-rich tissues.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=95 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/528372v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10f356forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17d259forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1312809org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3b6a8f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In scRNA-seq of viable versus DES bone marrow, dissociation induced global stress responses, immune and stromal cell activation, and loss of highly sensitive cell populations, which were prevented with DES. Further, we introduce a validated and flexible method for performing intracellular CITE-seq in DES-fixed cells. Leveraging this approach during Th17 T cell stimulation allowed the simultaneous quantification of transcriptomes and four phosphorylated proteins, leading to the identification of a hyperactivated state in p-ERK/p-FOS double positive cells, which we experimentally validated.

However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie this remain unknown. Using our murine model of maternal schistosomiasis, when immunized, males from infected mothers had a lower frequency of antigen-specific germinal center B cells and downregulation of transcripts downstream of BCR signaling compared to males from uninfected mothers. This is driven by a reduction in developing B cell populations within the bone marrow of pups from infected mothers. Males from infected mothers were impacted to a greater extent than their female littermate counterparts. We found this defect to be caused by aberrant expression of the long non-coding RNA Xist in males leading to dysregulated Ig expression on developing B cells. This, for the first time, links dysfunctional BCR signaling with Xist expression, while also proposing a detrimental function for Xist expression in males.\n\nOne sentence summaryXist expression in males decreases BCR reactivity.",

However, the essential requirement for AER-Fgf signalling during in vivo development makes it difficult to understand the exact roles that it fulfils. To overcome this barrier, we developed an amenable ex vivo chick wing tissue explant system that faithfully replicates in vivo parameters. Using inhibition experiments and RNA-sequencing, we identify a transient role for Fgfs in triggering the distal patterning phase. Fgfs are then dispensable for the maintenance of an intrinsic mesodermal transcriptome, which controls proliferation/differentiation timing and the duration of patterning. We also uncover additional roles for Fgf signalling in maintaining AER-related gene expression and in suppressing myogenesis. We describe a simple logic for limb patterning duration, which is potentially applicable to other systems, including the main body axis.",

Resorption of all tissue types was by osteoclasts invariably accompanied by companion mesenchymal tissue containing capillaries, mononuclear cells and mast cells. There were no new pathological mechanisms in play, rather the usurpation of normal physiological mechanisms of bone tissue remodelling and modelling.

    "abstract": "In the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus, there are three psbA genes coding for the Photosystem II (PSII) D1 subunit that interacts with most of the main cofactors involved in the electron transfers. Recently, the 3D crystal structures of both PsbA2-PSII and PsbA3-PSII have been solved [Nakajima et al., J. Biol. Chem. 298 (2022) 102668.]. It was proposed that the loss of one hydrogen bond of PheD1 due to the D1-Y147F exchange in PsbA2-PSII resulted in a more negative Em of PheD1 in PsbA2-PSII when compared to PsbA3-PSII. In addition, the loss of two water molecules in the Cl-1 channel was attributed to the D1-P173M substitution in PsbA2-PSII. This exchange, by narrowing the Cl-1 proton channel, could be at the origin of a slowing down of the proton release. Here, we have continued the characterization of PsbA2- PSII by measuring the thermoluminescence from the S2QA-/DCMU charge recombination and by measuring proton release kinetics using time-resolved absorption changes of the dye bromocresol purple. It was found that i) the Em of PheD1-*/PheD1 was decreased by [~] 30 mV in PsbA2-PSII when compared to PsbA3-PSII and ii) the kinetics of the proton release into the bulk was significantly slowed down in PsbA2-PSII in the S2TyrZ* to S3TyrZ and S3TyrZ* [-&gt;] (S3TyrZ*) transitions. This slowing down was partially reversed by the PsbA2/M173P mutation and induced by the PsbA3/P173M mutation thus confirming a role of the D1-173 residue in the egress of protons trough the Cl-1 channel.",

    "abstract": "Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) is a powerful method for the deep analysis of translation mechanisms and regulatory circuits during gene expression. Here, we established an optimized and high resolution Ribo-seq protocol for the unicellular model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlamydomonas). Comparing different nuclease treatments for the extraction and sequencing of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) and parallel RNA-seq, provided deep insight into translational dynamics and post-transcriptional control of gene expression, thoroughly covering more than 10,000 different transcripts. Our high quality Ribo-seq protocol captures the 3-nucleotide movement of elongating ribosomes along nuclear and chloroplast transcripts. Detailed analysis of the ribosomal offsets on transcripts uncovers presumable transition states during translocation of elongating ribosomes within the 5- and 3-sections of transcripts and features of eukaryotic translation termination. These offsets reveal drastic differences between the nature of cytosolic and chloroplast translation mechanisms. Chloroplast translation is further characterized by heterogenous RPF size distribution. We found that local accumulation of small RPFs correlates with local slowdown of psbA translation, possibly revealing an uncharacterized regulator step during PsbA/D1 synthesis. Further analyses of RPF distribution along specific cytosolic transcripts revealed characteristic patterns of translation elongation exemplified for the major light harvesting complex proteins, LHCs. Moreover, our Ribo-seq data can be utilized to survey coding sequence annotations and the expression preference of alternatively spliced transcripts in Chlamydomonas. We made these features easily accessible for the research community by attaching our Ribo-seq data to the most recent Chlamydomonas reference genome.",

    "abstract": "MADS-box genes represent a paneukaryotic gene family encoding transcription factors. Given its importance for essential functions in plants, animals and fungi, such as development of organ identity and mating type determination, the phylogeny of MADS-box genes is of great biological interest. It has been well established that a gene duplication in the stem group of extant eukaryotes generated two clades of MADS-box genes, termed Type I and Type II genes. Almost all Type II genes of land plants contain a keratin-like (K) domain in addition to the family-defining, DNA-binding MADS (M) domain and are also termed MIKC-type genes. Due to a lack of sampling of MADS-box genes in Archaeplastida (rhodophytes, glaucophytes, chlorophytes, and streptophytes) except land plants, the deep evolution of MADS-box genes in plants remains poorly understood, however. Here we use the genomic and transcriptomic ressources that have become available in recent years to answer longstanding questions of MADS-box gene evolution in Archaeplastida. Our results reveal that archaeplastid algae likely do not harbour Type I MADS-box genes. However, rhodophytes, glaucophytes, prasinodermophytes and chlorophytes possess Type II MADS-box genes without a K domain. Type II MADS-box genes with a K domain are found only in streptophytes. This corroborates previous views that some Type II gene acquired a K domain in the stem group of extant streptophytes, generating MIKC-type genes. Interestingly, we found both variants of Type II genes - with (MIKC) and without a K domain - in streptophyte algae, but not in land plants (embryophytes), suggesting that Type II genes without a K domain (ancestral Type II genes) were lost in the stem group of land plants. Our data reveal that the deep evolution of MADS-box genes in \"plants\" (Archaeplastida) was more complex than has previously been thought.",
