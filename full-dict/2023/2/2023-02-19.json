    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicle DNAs (evDNAs) possess the important diagnostic value for multiple diseases and play roles for horizontally transferring genetic materials among cells. In this study, we have found that transcription factor FOXM1 can mediate the loading of certain chromatin genes or DNA fragments (named FOXM1-chDNAs) to extracellular vesicles (EVs). FOXM1 interacts with LC3 in nucleus and FOXM1-chDNAs (such as DUX4 gene and Telomere DNA) are specified by FOXM1 and translocated to cytoplasm. These DNAs are released to EVs through the process of an LC3-involved autophagosome-multivesicular body (MVB) transport. The roles of FOXM1 on loading FOXM1-chDNAs to EVs are further confirmed by DNA-FISH experiments, tracing the translocation of selected chromatin loci with the TetO/TetR-GFP method, and PCR analysis of the DNA samples from MVBs and EVs. Furthermore, disrupting the expression of FOXM1 or the process of autophagosome-MVB transport impairs the loading of FOXM1-chDNAs to EVs. This discovery suggests that transcription factor FOXM1 contributes the constitution of evDNAs from nuclear chromatin, providing the first example to explain how chromatin DNA fragments are specified and loaded to EVs. It also provide a foundation to further explore the roles of evDNAs in biological processes such as the horizontal gene transfer.",

    "abstract": "Social behavior and social organization have major influences on individual health and fitness. Yet, biomedical research focuses on studying a few genotypes under impoverished social conditions. Understanding how lab conditions have modified social organizations of model organisms, such as lab mice, relative to natural populations is a missing link between socioecology and biomedical science. Using a common garden design, we describe the formation of social structure in the well-studied laboratory mouse strain, C57BL/6J, in replicated mixed-sex populations over 10-day trials compared to control trials with wild-derived outbred house mice in outdoor field enclosures. We focus on three key features of mouse social systems: (i) territory establishment in males, (ii) female social relationships, and (iii) the social networks formed by the populations. Male territorial behaviors were similar but muted in C57 compared to wild-derived mice. Female C57 sharply differed from wild-derived females, showing little social bias toward cage mates and exploring substantially more of the enclosures compared to all other groups. Female behavior consistently generated denser social networks in C57 than in wild-derived mice. The repeatable societies formed under field conditions highlights opportunities to experimentally study the interplay between society and individual biology using model organisms.",

    "abstract": "Touch sensation is primarily encoded by mechanoreceptors, called Low-Threshold Mechanoreceptors (LTMRs), with their cell bodies in the Dorsal Root Ganglia. Because of their great diversity in terms of molecular signature, terminal endings morphology and electrophysiological properties, mirroring the complexity of tactile experience, LTMRs are a model of choice to study the molecular cues differentially controlling neuronal diversification. While the transcriptional codes that define different LTMR subtypes have been extensively studied, the molecular players that participate in their late maturation and in particular in the striking diversity of their end-organ morphological specialization are largely unknown. Here we identified the TALE homeodomain transcription factor Meis2 as a key regulator of LTMRs target-field innervation. Meis2 is specifically expressed in cutaneous LTMRs and its expression depends on target-derived signals. While LTMRs lacking Meis2 survived and are normally specified, their end-organ innervations, electrophysiological properties and transcriptome are differentially and markedly affected, resulting in impaired sensory-evoked behavioral responses. These data establish Meis2 as a major transcriptional regulator controlling the orderly formation of sensory neurons innervating peripheral end-organs required for light touch.",

    "abstract": "Lens fibrosis is one of the leading causes of cataract in the elderly population. The primary energy substrate of the lens is glucose from the aqueous humor, and the transparency of mature lens epithelial cells (LECs) is dependent on glycolysis for ATP. Therefore, the deconstruction of reprogramming of glycolytic metabolism can contribute to further understanding of LEC epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In the present study, we found a novel pantothenate kinase 4 (PANK4)-related glycolytic mechanism that regulates LEC EMT. The PANK4 level was correlated with aging in cataract patients and mice. Loss of function of PANK4 significantly contributed to alleviating LEC EMT by upregulating pyruvate kinase M2 isozyme (PKM2), which was phosphorylated at Y105, thus switching oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. However, PKM2 regulation did not affect PANK4, demonstrating the downstream role of PKM2. Inhibition of PKM2 in Pank4-/- mice caused lens fibrosis, which supports the finding that the PANK4-PKM2 axis is required for LEC EMT. Glycolytic metabolism-governed hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) signaling is involved in PANK4-PKM2-related downstream signaling. However, HIF-1 elevation was independent of PKM2 (S37) but PKM2 (Y105) when PANK4 was deleted, which demonstrated that PKM2 and HIF-1 were not involved in a classic positive feedback loop. Collectively, these results indicate a PANK4-related glycolysis switch that may contribute to HIF-1 stabilization and PKM2 phosphorylation at Y105 and inhibit LEC EMT. The mechanism elucidation in our study may also shed light on fibrosis treatments for other organs.",

    "abstract": "Cellular distributions of the sphingolipid ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) impact essential biological processes. C1P levels are spatiotemporally regulated by ceramide-1-phosphate transfer protein (CPTP), which efficiently shuttles C1P between organelle membranes. Yet, how CPTP rapidly extracts and inserts C1P into a membrane remains unknown. Here, we devise a multiscale simulation approach to elucidate biophysical details of CPTP-mediated C1P transport. We find that CPTP binds a membrane poised to extract and insert C1P and that membrane binding promotes conformational changes in CPTP that facilitate C1P uptake and release. By significantly disrupting a lipids local hydrophobic environment in the membrane, CPTP lowers the activation free energy barrier for passive C1P desorption and enhances C1P extraction from the membrane. Upon uptake of C1P, further conformational changes may aid membrane unbinding in a manner reminiscent of the electrostatic switching mechanism used by other lipid transfer proteins. Insertion of C1P into an acceptor membrane, eased by a decrease in membrane order by CPTP, restarts the transfer cycle. Most notably, we provide molecular evidence for CPTPs ability to catalyze C1P extraction by breaking hydrophobic C1P-membrane contacts with compensatory hydrophobic lipid-protein contacts. Our work, thus, provides biophysical insights into how CPTP efficiently traffics C1P between membranes to maintain sphingolipid homeostasis and, additionally, presents a simulation method aptly suited for uncovering the catalytic mechanisms of other lipid transfer proteins.\n\nAuthor summaryCritical cellular processes require spatiotemporal regulation of sphingolipid levels among organelle membranes. Programmed cell death and inflammation, for example, are impacted by the distribution of ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P). C1P levels are specifically altered by ceramide-1-phosphate transfer protein (CPTP), which mediates C1P intermembrane transport. Using a multiscale simulation approach tailored to studying lipid transport, we elucidate key steps in the molecular mechanism used by CPTP to rapidly transport C1P between membranes: Through conformational changes that are coupled to membrane binding, CPTP significantly disrupts C1Ps local hydrophobic environment in a membrane and catalyzes its extraction. Since this catalytic mechanism is biophysically related to that of passive lipid transport, it may be ubiquitously used by lipid transport proteins to rapidly traffic lipids between membranes and ensure membrane homeostasis. Our multiscale simulation approach offers a framework to test this hypothesis and, thus, further our molecular knowledge of how lipid transfer proteins function to regulate cellular lipid distributions.",

    "abstract": "The IGF2BP family of RNA binding proteins consists of three paralogs that regulate intracellular RNA localization, RNA stability, and translational control. Although IGF2BP1 and 3 are oncofetal proteins, IGF2BP2 expression is maintained in many tissues, including the heart, into adulthood. Previous studies indicated that IGF2BP2 is upregulated in cardiomyocytes during cardiac stress and remodelling and returns to normal levels in recovering hearts. These results raise the possibility that IGF2BP2 might play an adaptive role during cardiac stress and recovery. Using a conditional, inducible transgenic mouse line, we found that enhanced expression of an IGF2BP2 transgene in newborn or adult hearts leads to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and death within 3-4 weeks. Downregulation of the transgene after 2 weeks, however, rescues these mice, with complete recovery by 12 weeks. Hearts overexpressing IGF2BP2 downregulate sarcomeric and mitochondrial proteins and have fragmented mitochondria and elongated, thinner sarcomeres. Consistent with these results, IGF2BP2 is upregulated in patients with DCM or after myocardial infarction. These results suggest that IGF2BP2 may be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in DCM.",

    "abstract": "KRAS is the most commonly mutated oncogene. Targeted therapies have been developed against mediators of key downstream signaling pathways, predominantly components of the RAF/MEK/ERK kinase cascade. Unfortunately, single-agent efficacy of these agents is limited both by intrinsic and acquired resistance. Survival of drug-tolerant persister cells (DTPs) within the heterogeneous tumor population and/or acquired mutations that reactivate receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/RAS signaling can lead to outgrowth of tumor initiating cells (TICs) and drive therapeutic resistance. Here, we show that targeting the key RTK/RAS pathway signaling intermediates SOS1 or KSR1 both enhances the efficacy of, and prevents resistance to, the MEK inhibitor trametinib in KRAS-mutated lung (LUAD) and colorectal (COAD) adenocarcinoma cell lines depending on the specific mutational landscape. The SOS1 inhibitor BI-3406 enhanced the efficacy of trametinib and prevented trametinib resistance by targeting spheroid initiating cells (SICs) in KRASG12/G13-mutated LUAD and COAD cell lines that lacked PIK3CA co-mutations. Cell lines with KRASQ61 and/or PIK3CA mutations were insensitive to trametinib and BI-3406 combination therapy. In contrast, deletion of the RAF/MEK/ERK scaffold protein KSR1 prevented drug-induced SIC upregulation and restored trametinib sensitivity across all tested KRAS mutant cell lines in both PIK3CA- mutated and PIK3CA wildtype cancers. Our findings demonstrate that vertical inhibition of RTK/RAS signaling is an effective strategy to prevent therapeutic resistance in KRAS- mutated cancers, but therapeutic efficacy is dependent on both the specific KRAS mutant and underlying co-mutations. Thus, selection of optimal therapeutic combinations in KRAS-mutated cancers will require a detailed understanding of functional dependencies imposed by allele-specific KRAS mutations.\n\nSignificance StatementWe provide an experimental framework for evaluating both adaptive and acquired resistance to RAS pathway-targeted therapies and demonstrate how targeting specific RAS pathway signaling intermediates SOS1 or KSR1 enhanced effectiveness of and prevented resistance to MEK inhibitors in KRAS-mutated cancer cells with genotypic precision. The contribution of either effector was dependent upon the mutational landscape: SOS1 inhibition synergized with trametinib in KRASG12/G13-mutated cells expressing WT PI3K but not in KRASQ61-mutated cells or if PIK3CA is mutated. KSR1 deletion inhibited MEK/ERK complex stability and was effective in cells that are unresponsive to SOS1 inhibition. These data demonstrate how a detailed understanding of functional dependencies imposed both by allele specific KRAS mutations and specific co-mutations facilitates the optimization of therapeutic combinations.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to profile the transcriptome of teeth and the surrounding tissues of an adult lizard dentition (Eublepharis macularius) that is actively replacing teeth throughout life. Bulk RNAseq was used to compare teeth that are in function versus unerupted, developing teeth and single cell RNA-seq was carried out on jaw segments containing the dental forming tissues. In bulk RNAseq data, we found that functional teeth expressed genes involved in bone and tooth resorption. Indeed, multinucleated odontoclasts were abundant in tissue sections of functional teeth undergoing resorption. Unexpectedly, chemotaxis gene SEMA3A was expressed within odontoblasts and in adjacent mesenchyme, confirmed using RNAscope. Semaphorins may be involved in regulating odontoclasts during tooth resorption. The scRNA-seq experiment successfully isolated dental mesenchyme and epithelial cells. We confirmed that some of these genes are expressed in the earliest tooth buds within the tooth forming field. In addition, we found evidence of convergent evolution in the tooth eruption trait. Geckos evolved a means for second generation teeth to communicate with the functional teeth. Instead of a dental follicle inducing an eruption pathway as in the mammal, the gecko and other squamate reptiles use the enamel organ of the successional teeth to trigger tooth resorption of the functional teeth, thus creating an eruption pathway. New molecules such as SEMA3A and SFRP2 may also participate in this process. Future studies on the gecko will uncover the molecular basis of convergent evolution in the dentition.",

    "abstract": "Beekeeping as a staple of agriculture in Kazakhstan is believed to have emerged when external bee specimens were introduced into the country. The Central Russian bee (Apis mellifera mellifera) has been present throughout Kazakhstanian apiaries for a long time since its import into Eastern Kazakhstan at the end of the 18th century. To date, six subspecies have been distributed across the country (A.m. sossimai, A.m. carpatica, A.m. mellifera, A.m. ligustica, [A].m. caucasica, and A.m. carnica). According to mitochondrial haplotype analysis based on DraI mtDNA COI-COII (DmCC) test, local samples were represented by C2 (316), C1 (99), and M4 (7) haplotypes. The results of simple sequence repeats (SSR) genotyping revealed a large polymorphism at nine microsatellite loci, with the number of alleles amounting to 35 (AP55), 32 (AP43), 25 (A124), 18 (A113), 13 (A88), 12 (A43), 11 (A007), 7 (A28), and 5 (A24). Relative to the expected heterozygosity (He), the observed heterozygosity (Ho) was slightly higher for most markers considering both the overall samples and individual populations. The inbreeding coefficient confirmed the excess outbreeding for the geographical populations of car-Shym-T (-0,105), car-zham-A (-0,114), Zhet-Alakol (-0,008), and Zhet-Ushbulak (-0,028). The admixture of honeybee local populations was confirmed by the research presented here.The differentiation of populations was only possible by geographical location according to clustering analysis. A considerable degree of genetic admixtures among subspecies was identified in every population. The subspecies were not separated from each other. None of the groups formed by the neighbor-joining tree based on Neis genetic distance included a precise subspecies or population. All groups represented an admixture of subspecies from different populations.\n\nUnregulated cross-breeding for the past 50 years has laid the foundation for the promiscuous genetic nature of honeybee populations in Kazakhstan. It could be concluded that some samples were the result of cross-breeding with endemic bee Apis mellifera pomonella since most apiaries were located in areas of endemic bee distribution.",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms utilize nutrients primarily to generate biomass and replicate. When a single nutrient source is available, the produced biomass increases linearly with the initial amount of the available nutrient. This linear trend can be predicted to high accuracy by \"black box models\" that consider growth as a single chemical reaction with nutrients as substrates and biomass as a product. Since natural environments typically feature multiple nutrients, we here quantify the effect of co-utilization of multiple nutrients on bacterial biomass production. First, we demonstrate a mutual effect between the metabolism of different nutrient sources where the ability to utilize one is affected by the other. Second, we show that for some nutrient combinations, the produced biomass is no longer linear to the initial amount of nutrients. These observations cannot be explained by the traditional \"black box models\", presumably because the metabolism of one nutrient affects another, which is not accounted for by these models. To capture these observations, we extent \"black box models\" to include catabolism, anabolism, and biosynthesis of biomass precursors and phenomenologically add a mutual effect between the metabolism of the nutrient sources. The expanded model qualitatively recaptures the experimental observations and, unexpectedly, predicts that the produced biomass is not only dependent on the combination of nutrient sources but also on their relative initial amounts. We validate this prediction experimentally by demonstrating how measurement of the produced biomass can be used to determine how each nutrient effects the metabolic processes of another.",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a powerful class of computational models for unravelling neural mechanisms of brain function. However, for neural control of movement, they currently must be integrated with software simulating biomechanical effectors, leading to limiting impracticalities: (1) researchers must rely on two different platforms and (2) biomechanical effectors are not generally differentiable, constraining researchers to reinforcement learning algorithms despite the existence and potential biological relevance of faster training methods. To address these limitations, we developed MotorNet, an open-source Python toolbox for creating arbitrarily complex, differentiable, and biomechanically realistic effectors that can be trained on user-defined motor tasks using ANNs. MotorNet is designed to meet several goals: ease of installation, ease of use, a high-level user-friendly API, and a modular architecture to allow for flexibility in model building. MotorNet requires no dependencies outside Python, making it easy to get started with. For instance, it allows training ANNs on typically used motor control models such as a two joint, six muscle, planar arm within minutes on a typical desktop computer. MotorNet is built on TensorFlow and therefore can implement any network architecture that is possible using the TensorFlow framework. Consequently, it will immediately benefit from advances in artificial intelligence through TensorFlow updates. Finally, it is open source, enabling users to create and share their own improvements, such as new effector and network architectures or custom task designs. MotorNets focus on higher order model and task design will alleviate overhead cost to initiate computational projects for new researchers by providing a standalone, ready-to-go framework, and speed up efforts of established computational teams by enabling a focus on concepts and ideas over implementation.",

    "abstract": "Neuropixels probes have become a crucial tool for high-density electrophysiological recordings. Although most research involving these electrodes is in acute preparations, some scientific inquiries require long-term recordings in freely moving animals. Recent reports have presented prosthesis designs for chronic recordings, but some of them do not allow for probe recovery, which is desirable given their cost. Others appear to be fragile, as these articles describe numerous broken implants. This fragility presents a challenge for recordings in rats, particularly in epilepsy models where strong mechanical stress impinges upon the prosthesis. To overcome these limitations, we present a new prosthesis specifically designed to protect the probes from strong shocks and enable the safe retrieval of electrodes after experiments. This implant was successfully used to record from healthy and epileptic rats for up to three weeks almost continuously, with a probe retrieval and reuse success rate of 91%, improving previously described recycling performances.",

    "abstract": "Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are among the most ubiquitous and abundant groups of Archaea on Earth, widely distributed in marine, terrestrial, and geothermal ecosystems. However, the genomic diversity, biogeography, and evolutionary process of AOA populations in subsurface environments are vastly understudied compared to those of marine and soil AOA. We here report a novel AOA order Candidatus Nitrosomirales that forms a deeply branching basal sister lineage to the thermophilic Ca. Nitrosocaldales. Metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene read mapping demonstrates the dominant presence of Nitrosomirales AOA in various groundwater environments and their widespread distribution across a range of geothermal, terrestrial, and marine habitats. Notably, terrestrial Nitrosomirales AOA show the genetic capacity of using formate as an alternative source of reductant and appear to have acquired key metabolic genes and operons from other mesophilic populations via horizontal gene transfer, including the genes encoding urease, nitrite reductase, and V-type ATPase. Potential metabolic versatility and acquired functions may facilitate their radiation into a variety of subsurface, marine, and soil environments. Molecular thermometer-based evolutionary analysis suggests that Nitrosomirales originated from thermophilic environments and transitioned into temperate habitats in parallel with Nitrososphaerales and Nitrosopumilales. We also provide evidence that terrestrial-marine habitat transitions occurred within each one of the four AOA orders, which reveals a more complex evolutionary trajectory of major AOA lineages than previously proposed. Together, these findings establish a robust taxonomic and evolutionary framework of AOA and provide new insights into the ecology and evolution of this globally abundant functional guild.",

    "abstract": "Metabolism in males and females is distinct. Differences are usually linked to sexual reproduction, with circulating signals (e.g. hormones) playing major roles. By contrast, sex differences prior to sexual maturity and intrinsic to individual metabolic tissues are less understood. We analyzed Drosophila melanogaster larvae and find that males store more fat than females, the opposite of the sexual dimorphism in adults. We show that metabolic differences are intrinsic to the major fat storage tissue, including many differences in the expression of metabolic genes. Our previous work identified fat storage roles for Spenito (Nito), a conserved RNA-binding protein and regulator of sex determination. Nito knockdown specifically in the fat storage tissue abolished fat differences between males and females. We further show that Nito is required for sex-specific expression of the master regulator of sex determination, Sex-lethal (Sxl). \"Feminization\" of fat storage cells via tissue-specific overexpression of a Sxl target gene made larvae lean, reduced the fat differences between males and females, and induced female-like metabolic gene expression. Altogether, this study supports a model in which Nito autonomously controls sexual dimorphisms and differential expression of metabolic genes in fat cells in part through its regulation of the sex determination pathway.",

For instance, using a 500-l/min flow rate and a 3-minute chromatographic gradient, Speedy-PASEF quantified 5,211 proteins from 2 g of a mammalian cell-line standard at high quantitative accuracy and precision. We further used Speedy-PASEF to analyze blood plasma samples from a cohort of COVID-19 inpatients, using a 3-minute chromatographic gradient and alternating column regeneration on a dual pump system, for processing 398 samples per day. Speedy-PASEF delivered a comprehensive view of the COVID-19 plasma proteome, allowing classification of the patients according to disease severity and revealing plasma biomarker candidates. Speedy-PASEF thus facilitates acquisition of high-quality proteomes in large numbers.",

    "abstract": "Social interaction allows for the transfer of affective states among individuals, and the behaviors and expressions associated with pain and fear can evoke anxiety-like states in observers which shape subsequent social interactions. We hypothesized that social reactions to stressed individuals engage the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) which promotes anxiety-like behavior via postsynaptic action of serotonin at serotonin 2C (5-HT2C) receptors in the forebrain. First, we inhibited the DRN by administering an agonist (8-OH-DPAT, 1{micro}g in 0.5{micro}L) for the inhibitory 5-HT1A autoreceptors which silences 5-HT neuronal activity via G-protein coupled inward rectifying potassium channels. 8-OH-DPAT prevented the approach and avoidance, respectively, of stressed juvenile (PN30) or stressed adult (PN60) conspecifics in the social affective preference (SAP) test in rats. Similarly, systemic administration of a 5-HT2C receptor antagonist (SB242084, 1mg/kg, i.p.) prevented approach and avoidance of stressed juvenile or adult conspecifics, respectively. Seeking a locus of 5-HT2C action, we considered the posterior insular cortex which is critical for social affective behaviors and rich with 5-HT2C receptors. SB242084 administered directly into the insular cortex (5{micro}M in 0.5{micro}L bilaterally) interfered with the typical approach and avoidance behaviors observed in the SAP test. Finally, using fluorescent in situ hybridization, we found that 5-HT2C receptor mRNA (htr2c) is primarily colocalized with mRNA associated with excitatory glutamatergic neurons (vglut1) in the posterior insula. Importantly, the results of these treatments were the same in male and female rats. These data suggest that interactions with stressed others require the serotonergic DRN and that serotonin modulates social affective decision-making via action at insular 5-HT2C receptors.",

    "abstract": "Background and objectiveThere is mounting evidence to suggest that the gut-brain axis is involved in the development of Parkinsons disease (PD). In this regard, the enteroendocrine cells (EEC), which faces the gut lumen and are connected with both enteric neurons and glial cells have received growing attention. The recent observation showing that these cells express alpha-synuclein, a presynaptic neuronal protein genetically and neuropathologically linked to PD came to reinforce the assumption that EEC might be a key component of the neural circuit between the gut lumen and the brain for the bottom-up propagation of PD pathology. Besides alpha-synuclein, tau is another key protein involved in neurodegeneration and converging evidences indicate that there is an interplay between these two proteins at both molecular and pathological levels. There are no existing studies on tau in EEC and therefore we set out to examine the isoform profile and phosphorylation state of tau in these cells.\n\nMethodsSurgical specimens of human colon from control subjects were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using a panel of anti-tau antibodies together with chromogranin A and Glucagon-like peptide-1 (two EEC markers) antibodies. To investigate tau phosphorylation and expression further, two EEC lines, namely GLUTag and NCI-H716 were analyzed by western blot after dephosphorylation with pan-tau and tau isoform specific antibodies. Eventually, GLUTag were treated with propionate and butyrate, two short chain fatty acids known to sense EEC, and analyzed at different time points by western blot with an antibody specific for tau phosphorylated at Thr205.\n\nResultsWe found that tau is expressed and phosphorylated in EEC in adult human colon and that both EEC lines mainly express two tau isoforms that are phosphorylated under basal condition. Both propionate and butyrate regulated tau phosphorylation state by decreasing its phosphorylation at Thr205.\n\nConclusion and inferenceOur study is the first to characterize tau in human EEC and in EEC lines. As a whole, our findings provide a basis to unravel the functions of tau in EEC and to further investigate the possibility of pathological changes in tauopathies and synucleinopathies.",

    "abstract": "The development of precise neural circuits in the brain requires spontaneous patterns of neural activity prior to functional maturation. In the rodent cerebral cortex patchwork and wave patterns of activity develop in somatosensory and visual regions, respectively, and are present at birth. However, whether such activity patterns occur in non-eutherian mammals, as well as when and how they arise during development remain open questions relevant to understand brain formation in health and disease. Since the onset of patterned cortical activity is challenging to study prenatally in eutherians, here we offer a new approach in a minimally invasive manner using marsupial dunnarts, whose cortex forms postnatally. We discovered similar patchwork and travelling waves in the dunnart somatosensory and visual cortices at stage 27 (equivalent to newborn mice), and examined progressively earlier stages of development to determine their onset and how they first emerge. We observed that these patterns of activity emerge in a region-specific and sequential manner, becoming evident as early as stage 24 in somatosensory and stage 25 in visual cortices (equivalent to embryonic day 16 and 17, respectively, in mice), as cortical layers establish and thalamic axons innervate the cortex. In addition to sculpting synaptic connections of existing circuits, evolutionarily conserved patterns of neural activity could therefore help regulate early events in cortical development.\n\nSignificance StatementRegion-specific patterns of neural activity are present at birth in rodents and are thought to refine synaptic connections during critical periods of cerebral cortex development. Marsupials are born much more immature than rodents, allowing the investigation of how these patterns arise in vivo. We discovered that cortical activity patterns are remarkably similar in marsupial dunnarts and rodents, and that they emerge very early, before cortical neurogenesis is complete. Moreover, they arise from the outset in different patterns specific to somatosensory and visual areas (i.e., patchworks and waves) indicating they may also play evolutionarily conserved roles in cortical regionalization during development.",

It is crucial to estimate the protective effect of the neutralizing antibodies generated by such mass infections against the next potential SARS-CoV-2 reinfection wave, especially if driven by CH.1.1 or XBB.1.5. Previously, we recruited and continuously followed a cohort of individuals that experienced Omicron BA.1, BA.2, and BA.5 breakthrough infections, as well as a control cohort with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the previously uninfected cohort, the total symptomatic infection rate surveyed during the outbreak was 91.6%, while the symptomatic reinfection rate was 32.9%, 10.5%, and 2.8% among individuals with prior Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.5 infection, respectively, with median intervals between infections of 335, 225 and 94 days. Pseudovirus neutralization assays were performed in plasma samples collected from previously Omicron BA.1-infected individuals approximately 3 months before the outbreak. Results indicate a robust correlation between the plasma neutralizing antibody titers and the protective effect against symptomatic reinfection. The geometric mean of the 50% neutralizing titers (NT50) against D614G, BA.5, and BF.7 were 2.0, 2.5, and 2.3-fold higher in individuals without symptomatic reinfection than in those with symptomatic reinfection (p < 0.01). Low plasma neutralizing antibody titer (below the geometric mean of NT50) was associated with an enhanced cumulative risk of symptomatic reinfection, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 23.55 (95% CI: 9.23-60.06) against BF.7 subvariant. Importantly, neutralizing antibodies titers post one month after BF.7/BA.5 breakthrough infections against CH.1.1 and XBB.1.5 are similar to that against BF.7 from individuals with prior BA.1 infection while not experiencing a symptomatic BF.7/BA.5 reinfection (plasma collected 3 months before the outbreak), suggesting that the humoral immunity generated by the current BF.7/BA.5 breakthrough infection may provide protection against CH.1.1 and XBB.1.5 symptomatic reinfection wave for 4 months. Of note, the higher hACE2 binding of XBB.1.5 may reduce the protection period since the potential increase of infectivity.",

We developed a spatial patch-foraging task for rats, in which subjects chose how long to remain in one foraging patch as the rate of food earnings steadily decreased. The cost of seeking out a new location was varied across sessions. The behavioral task was designed to mimic the structure of natural foraging problems, where distinct spatial locations are associated with different reward statistics, and decisions require navigation and movement through space. Male and female rats generally followed the predictions of theoretical models of foraging, albeit with a consistent tendency to persist with patches for too long compared with behavioral strategies that maximize food intake rate. The tendency to choose overly-long patch residence times was stronger in male rats. We also observed sex differences in locomotion as rats performed the task, but these differences in movement only partially accounted for the differences in patch residence durations observed between male and female rats. Together, these results suggest a nuanced relationship between movement, sex, and foraging decisions.",

    "abstract": "Changes in spontaneous brain activity at rest provide rich information about behavior and cognition. The mathematical properties of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) are a depiction of brain function and are frequently used to predict cognitive phenotypes. Individual characteristics such as age, gender, and total intracranial volume (TIV) play an important role in predictive modeling of rsfMRI (for example, as \"confounders\" in many cases). It is unclear, however, to what extent rsfMRI carries independent information from the individual characteristics that is able to predict cognitive phenotypes. Here, we used predictive modeling to thoroughly examine the predictability of four cognitive phenotypes in 20,000 healthy UK Biobank subjects. We extracted common rsfMRI features of functional brain connectivity (FC) and temporal complexity (TC). We assessed the ability of these features to predict outcomes in the presence and absence of age, gender, and TIV. Additionally, we assessed the predictiveness of age, gender, and TIV only. We find TC and FC features to perform comparably with regard to predicting cognitive phenotypes. As compared to rsfMRI features, individual characteristics provide systematically better predictions with smaller sample sizes and, to some extent, in larger cohorts. It is also consistent across different levels of inherent temporal noise in rsfMRI. Our results suggest that when the objective is to perform cognitive predictions as opposed to understanding the relationship between brain and behavior, individual characteristics are more applicable than rsfMRI features.",

    "abstract": "We investigated morphological changes in the corticospinal tract (CST) to understand the mechanism underlying recovery of hand function after lesion of the CST at the C4/C5 border in 7 macaque monkeys. All monkeys exhibited complete recovery of precision grip success ratio within a few months. The trajectories and terminals of CST from the contralesional (n = 4) and ipsilesional (n = 3) hand area of primary motor cortex (M1) were investigated at 5-29 months after the injury using an anterograde neural tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA). Reorganization of the CST was assessed by counting the number of BDA-labeled axons and button-like swellings in the gray and white matters. Rostral to the lesion (at C3), the number of axon collaterals of the descending axons from both contralesional and ipsilesional M1 entering the ipsilesional and contralesional gray matter, respectively, were increased. Caudal to the lesion (at C8), axons originating from the contralesional M1, descending in the preserved gray matter around the lesion, and terminating in ipsilesional laminae VI/VII and IX were observed. In addition, axons and terminals from the ipsilesional M1 increased in the ipsilesional laminae VI/VII and IX after recrossing the midline, which were not observed in intact monkeys. Conversely, axons originating from the ipsilesional M1 and directed toward the contralesional laminae VI/VII and IX decreased. These results suggest that multiple reorganizations of the corticospinal projections to spinal segments both rostral and caudal to the lesion originating from bilateral M1 underlie a prominent recovery in long-term after spinal cord injury.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTPrevious studies have shown that dexterous finger movements recover prominently after lesion of the corticospinal tract (CST) at the mid-cervical segments through rehabilitative training in macaque monkeys. Here, we show reorganization of the CST including sprouting of axons originating from the contralesional and ipsilesional motor cortex in the gray matter both caudal and rostral to the lesion, including a re-direction of the CST to hand motoneurons in the monkeys 5-29 months after the lesion. Thus, multiple mechanisms of reorganization of CST axons underlie the recovery of impaired cortico-motoneuronal pathways for the long-term recovery of finger dexterity.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) evokes fast epidural Evoked Compound Action Potential (ECAPs) that represent activity of dorsal column axons, but not necessarily a spinal circuit response. Using a multimodal approach, we identified and characterized a delayed and slower potential evoked by SCS that reflects synaptic activity within the spinal cord. Anesthetized female Sprague Dawley rats were implanted with an epidural SCS lead, epidural motor cortex stimulation electrodes, an epidural spinal cord recoding lead, an intraspinal penetrating recording electrode array, and intramuscular electromyography (EMG) electrodes in the hindlimb and back. We stimulated the motor cortex or the epidural spinal cord and recorded epidural, intraspinal, and EMG responses. SCS pulses produced characteristic propagating ECAPs (composed of P1, N1, and P2 waves with latencies <2 ms) and an additional wave (\"S1\") starting after the N2. We verified the S1-wave was not a stimulation artifact and was not a reflection of hindlimb/back EMG. The S1-wave has a distinct stimulation-intensity dose response and spatial profile compared to ECAPs. CNQX (a selective competitive antagonist of AMPA receptors) significantly diminished the S1-wave, but not ECAPs. Furthermore, cortical stimulation, which did not evoke ECAPs, produced epidurally detectable and CNQX-sensitive responses at the same spinal sites, confirming epidural recording of an evoked synaptic response. Finally, applying 50 Hz SCS resulted in dampening of ESAPs, but not ECAPs. Therefore, we hypothesize that the S1-wave is synaptic in origin, and we term the S1-wave type responses: Evoked Synaptic Activity Potentials (ESAPs). The identification and characterization of epidurally recorded ESAPs from the dorsal horn may elucidate SCS mechanisms.\n\nSignificance StatementSpinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an established treatment for chronic pain and has applications to other disorders and neurorehabilitation. Notwithstanding decades of trials and research, questions remain about SCS mechanisms of action - and indicators thereof. Recent technological developments have enabled the detection of Evoked Compound Action Potential (ECAPs) - reflecting synchronous activity of the dorsal column axons activated by SCS. However, ECAP is not a direct measure of sensory processing in the dorsal horn. Here, we identify and characterize a novel electrophysiological signal that is evoked and detectable by epidural SCS electrodes and reflects spinal synaptic currents. This new signal, termed an Evoked Synaptic Activity Potential (ESAP), is thus a novel means with which to interrogate spinal gray matter circuits during SCS.",

    "abstract": "When attempting to recall previously seen visual information, people often move their eyes to the same locations where they initially viewed it. These eye-movements are thought to serve a role in enhancing memory retrieval, although the exact mechanism underlying this effect is yet unknown. To investigate this link between eye-movements and memory, we conducted an experiment with 80 adult participants. Participants were asked to perform a memory retrieval task, while viewing either the same visual context as during encoding or an altered one.\n\nResults showed that the benefit of eye movements to memory retrieval was dependent on the visual input. This suggests that the contribution of eye-movements to memory may not be from the motor behavior itself, but from its visual consequences. Our findings thus challenge the hypothesis that eye movements act as a motor retrieval cue and support the view that their visual consequences act as a sensory one.\n\nStatement of RelevanceAn intriguing question in cognition is how humans encode memorized material and what helps them retrieve it. It is known that when an action or stimulus is repeated both when information is encoded and when it is retrieved, this can act as a  retrieval cue and enhance memory performance. It is also known that people tend to reenact the same eye movements during retrieval as they did during encoding, and this behavior is associated with higher memory performance. This has led to the hypothesis that eye movements act as a retrieval cue. However, we challenge this hypothesis by showing that the visual consequences of eye movements, rather than the motor action that accompanies them, is the key factor for memory enhancement. Understanding the factors that influence memory provides crucial insight into the relationship between external behaviors and internal memory processes, leading to significant implications for the educational and clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Age-related cognitive decline has been linked to distinct patterns of cellular dysfunction in the prelimbic cortex (PL) and the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus. Because higher cognitive functions require both structures, selectively targeting a neurobiological change in one region, at the expense of the other, is not likely to restore normal behavior in older animals. One change with age that both the PL and CA3 share, however, is a reduced ability to utilize glucose, which can produce aberrant neural activity patterns. The current study used a ketogenic diet (KD) intervention, which reduces the brains reliance on glucose, and has been shown to improve cognition, as a metabolic treatment for restoring neural ensemble dynamics in aged rats. Expression of the immediate-early genes Arc and Homer1a were used to quantify the neural ensembles that were active in the home cage prior to behavior, during a working memory/biconditional association task, and a continuous spatial alternation task. Aged rats on the control diet had increased activity in CA3 and less ensemble overlap in PL between different task conditions than did the young animals. In the PL, the KD was associated with increased activation of neurons in the superficial cortical layers. The KD did not lead to any significant changes in CA3 activity. These observations suggest that the KD does not restore neuron activation patterns in aged animals, but rather the availability of ketone bodies in the frontal cortices may permit the engagement of compensatory mechanisms that produce better cognitive outcomes.\n\nSignificance StatementThis study extends understanding of how a ketogenic diet (KD) intervention may improve cognitive function in older adults. Young and aged rats were given 3 months of a KD or a calorie-match control diet and then expression of the immediate-early genes Arc and Homer1a were measured to examine neural ensemble dynamics during cognitive testing. The KD diet was associated with increased activation of neurons in the superficial layers of the PL, but there were no changes in CA3. These observations are significant because they suggest that compensatory mechanisms for improving cognition are engaged in the presence of elevated ketone bodies. This metabolic shift away from glycolysis can meet the energetic needs of the frontal cortices when glucose utilization is compromised.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorylation of tau at sites associated with Alzheimers disease (AD) likely plays a role in the disease progression. Mitochondrial impairment, correlating with increased presence of phosphorylated tau, has been identified as a contributing factor to neurodegenerative processes in AD. However, how tau phosphorylated at specific sites impacts mitochondrial function has not been fully defined. We examined how AD-relevant phosphomimetics of tau impact selected aspects of mitochondrial biology. To mimic phosphorylation at AD-associated sites, the Ser/Thr sites in wild-type GFP tagged-tau (T4) were converted to glutamic acid (E) to make pseudophosphorylated GFP tagged-Ser-396/404 (2EC) and GFP tagged-Thr-231/Ser-235 (2EM) constructs. These constructs were expressed in neuronal HT22 cells and their impact on specific mitochondrial functions and responses to stressors were measured. Phosphomimetic tau altered mitochondrial distribution. Specifically, mitochondria accumulated in the soma of cells expressing either 2EC or 2EM, and neurite-like extensions in 2EC cells were shorter. Additionally, ATP levels were reduced in both 2EC and 2EM expressing cells, and ROS production increased in 2EC cells during oxidation of succinate when compared to T4 expressing cells. Thapsigargin reduced mitochondrial membrane potential ({Psi}m) and increased ROS production in both 2EC and 2EM cells relative to T4 cells, with no significant difference in the effects of rotenone. These results show that tau phosphorylation at specific AD-relevant epitopes negatively affects mitochondria, with the extent of dysfunction and stress response varying according to the sites of phosphorylation. Altogether, these findings extend our understanding of potential mechanisms whereby phosphorylated tau promotes mitochondria dysfunction in tauopathies, including AD.\n\nFunding informationR01 AG067617",

    "abstract": "Alpha- and Beta-frequency oscillatory waves are evident in resting-state electro- and magneto-encephalography (EEG, MEG). Higher peak frequencies for Alpha and Beta are associated with greater cognitive health. Aging slows down the alpha and beta waves which are also affected by mental states, disorders such as ADHD, and sleep deprivation. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of resting-state brain activity reveals anti-correlation of very low frequency (< 0.1 Hz) fluctuations between two distributed cerebral cortical networks, the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN) and the Default Mode Network (DMN). DAN activation is related to attentional demands in extrinsic tasks, whereas DMN is associated with mind wandering, episodic memory retrieval, and intrinsic processing. Prior research has found that higher DAN-DMN anticorrelation is related to greater cognitive and mental health. Here, we investigated whether these two measures of cognitive and mental health are related to each other within individuals. We investigated resting-state Functional Connectivity (rsFC) between the DMN and DAN using fMRI and alpha and beta peaks from MEG using two large datasets (n=89 and n=189). We found that more robust anti-correlations between DMN and DAN regions are related to higher peak frequencies of alpha and beta rhythms in the brain. Subjects with higher alpha peak frequencies also show stronger positive within-network connectivity in both the DMN and DAN networks. Females show stronger correspondence between the two measures as compared to males. This association between two non-invasive cognitive neuroscience modalities adds to the growing literature on the biomarkers of cognitive and mental health.\n\nKey pointsO_LIMEG/EEG biomarker of brain health is correlated with rs-fMRI biomarker of brain health\nC_LIO_LIAlpha and beta peak frequency correlated with DMN-DAN functional connectivity\nC_LIO_LIStronger within-network connectivity for subjects with a high alpha peak frequency\nC_LIO_LIFemales have a stronger association between peak frequency and DMN-DAN connectivity\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Lysine acetylation has been discovered in thousands of non-histone human proteins, including most metabolic enzymes. Deciphering the functional roles of acetylation is fundamental to understanding how metabolic cues mediate cellular signaling and regulation of metabolic enzymes. One specific example is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, which has been found to be acetylated on multiple lysine residues. Using site-specifically acetylated proteins, we show that acetylation can both activate and inhibit G6PD. Acetylation-dependent inactivation is explained by structural studies showing distortion of the dimeric structure and active site of G6PD. In addition, we provide direct evidence for the acetylation-dependent phosphorylation and ubiquitylation of G6PD, as well as its interaction with p53 and induction of early apoptotic events. These findings underscore the important role of lysine acetylation in metabolic regulation and highlight the interplay between acetylation of metabolic enzymes and apoptotic signaling cascades.",

In this study, we developed mannosylated lipid nanoparticles that can effectively mitigate lung injury at the initiation of mechanical ventilation with lower doses of miR-146a. We used a physiologically relevant humanized in vitro co-culture system to evaluate the cell-specific targeting efficiency of the mannosylated lipid nanoparticle. We discovered that mannosylated lipid nanoparticles preferentially deliver miR-146a to alveolar macrophages and reduce force-induced inflammation in vitro. Our in vivo study using a clinically relevant mouse model of hemorrhagic shock-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome demonstrated that delivery of a low dose miR-146a (0.1 nmol) using mannosylated lipid nanoparticles dramatically increases miR-146a in mouse alveolar macrophages and decreases lung inflammation.

    "abstract": "Reverse neuronal replay, characterized by the sequential reactivation of hippocampal place cells that represents past experiences, is proposed to organize learned knowledges into a cognitive map. Here we utilized the continuous attractor model to simulate the formation of the hexagonal pattern of entorhinal grid cells, the metric for cognitive map, during the experience replay of hippocampal place cell. We found a significant enhancement in grid periodicity with reverse replay compared to that without replay. This facilitation effect was exclusive to reverse replay, as neither forward nor shuffled-experience replay elicited a similar effect. Further investigation revealed that the relationship between experience replay and hexagonal pattern formation was modulated by the interaction between the spatial scales of grid cells and the length of replayed experience, as reverse replay with lengths of past experience adapted to the scale was particularly effective in maintaining the stability of receptive fields in smaller scale grid cells. In summary, our results illustrate a causative link between experience replay and hexagonal pattern formation from a computational perspective, providing insights into how reverse reactivations of hippocampal place cells may facilitate the construction of abstract knowledge structures through the formation of the hexagonal pattern of entorhinal grid cells.",

    "abstract": "Even in the absence of antibiotic exposure, the gut microbiome of infants has been shown to contain numerous antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), but the mechanism for this remains unclear. In environmental bacteria, the selective advantage of ARGs can be increased through co-localization with genes such as other ARGs, biocide resistance genes, metal resistance genes, and virulence genes. However, this phenomenon is unknown from the human gut microbiome during early life despite frequent exposures to biocides and metals from an early age. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of genetic co-localization of resistance genes in a cohort of 662 Danish children and examined the association between such co-localization and environmental factors as well as gut microbial maturation. Our study showed that co-localization of ARGs with other resistance and virulence genes is common in the early gut microbiome and is associated with gut bacteria that are indicative of low maturity, especially E. coli. The most common forms of co-localization involved tetracycline and fluoroquinolone resistance genes located near other ARGs, and, on plasmids, co-localization predominantly occurred in the form of class 1 integrons. Antibiotic use caused a short-term increase in mobile ARGs, while non-mobile ARGs showed no significant change. Finally, we found that a high abundance of virulence genes was associated with low gut microbial maturity and that virulence genes showed even higher potential for mobility than ARGs. Our study highlights important constraints that need to be considered when developing strategies to combat ARG dissemination.",

    "abstract": "In addition to oxygenic photosynthetic systems, solar radiation is utilized for energy by diverse anoxygenic photosynthetic systems. Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (AAPB) perform photosynthesis without producing oxygen but still live in aerobic conditions. Typically they have been reported from aquatic ecosystems, but they can also be found from polar and desert soil ecosystems and primary succession communities like soil crusts. Recently, AAPB have been discovered in the metagenomic data of several plant phyllospheres. By utilizing citizen science, we screened plant foliar samples from eleven different locations in Finland for AAPB by near infrared fluorescence imaging of culturable phyllosphere and endosphere bacteria. Near infrared fluorescence reports the presence of AAPB which contain Bacteriochlorophyll a molecules, embedded in Light Harvesting 1 - Reaction Center complex. We found that AAPB were ubiquotous in phyllosphere communities of diverse plant species in all sampling locations. They were also consistently present in the endosphere of plant species with perennial leaves. Most of the AAPB isolated represent alphaproteobacterial genera Sphingomonas and Methylobacterium, but several isolates from genus Lichenihabitans as well as putative novel alphaproteobacterial taxa were also identified. Methylobacterial isolates were mostly detected in the phyllosphere with weak host specificity, while Sphingomonas AAPB were detected also in the endosphere of several plant species, with clear host specific taxa. We studied also the fluorescence spectral properties of several AAPBs. All the observed spectra resemble typical fluorescence spectral properties of Light Harvesting complex 1. Still, slight variation among each spectra could be obtained, revealing some physical difference among the complexes. Our results demonstrate for the first time, that AAPB are common in cold climate plant endophytic as well as epiphytic microbiomes and they build up substantial amounts of Bacteriochlorophyll a containing Light Harvesting complexes. Their putative role in plant adaptation to strong seasonality in light and temperature or tolerance of abiotic stressors remains to be investigated in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide1,2. The splicing factor RBM10 is commonly mutated in various cancer types and is strikingly one of the most mutated genes in LUAD (~9-25%)3-7. Most RBM10 cancer mutations are loss-of-function that correlate with increased tumorigenesis and poor survival8-12, and limit the efficacy of targeted therapies in EGFR-mutated lung cancer13. Notably, exploiting RBM10 deficiency for targeted cancer therapy has not yet been explored, highlighting the urgency of identifying genetic vulnerabilities to RBM10 loss. Prompted by this, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 synthetic lethal (SL) screen in isogenic LUAD cell line harboring RBM10 cancer mutation and identified 262 high-scoring RBM10 SL genes, including Aurora A and WEE1 kinases. We show that pharmacological inhibition of WEE1 selectively sensitizes RBM10-deficient LUAD cells, including patient-derived cells harboring RBM10 cancer mutations, in vitro and in mouse xenograft model. Moreover, the sensitivity of RBM10-deficient cells to WEE1 inhibition is further exacerbated by combined treatment with Aurora kinase A inhibitor. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the sensitivity to WEE1 inhibition is irrespective of RBM10 splicing activity, and potentiated by DNA damage accumulation, replication stress, and premature mitotic entry. Interestingly, we also reveal an unexpected role of RBM10 in promoting replication fork progression and stress response, at least in part, through its association with replication fork components. Collectively, our data identify DNA replication stress as an SL pathway with RBM10 loss, and provide a repertoire of targets that can be harnessed therapeutically to eradicate RBM10-deficient tumors.",

In recent years, the in vitro cardiac differentiation using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) has been used to uncover the intricate gene network regulation involved in the proper formation and function of the human heart. Here, we searched for uncharacterized cardiac developmental genes by combining a temporal evaluation of the human cardiac specification in vitro with the analysis of fetal and adult heart tissue gene expression. We discovered that CARDEL (CARdiac DEvelopment Long non-coding RNA; LINC00890; SERTM2) expression coincides with the commitment to the cardiac lineage. CARDEL knockout hPSCs differentiated poorly in cardiac cells, and hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes showed faster beating rates after CARDEL controlled overexpression during differentiation. Altogether, we demonstrate physiological and molecular evidence that CARDEL expression contributes to sculpting the cardiac program during cell-fate commitment.",

    "abstract": "In primates, the fovea is a pit in the center of the macula, which is a region of the retina with a high concentration of cone photoreceptor cells that accounts for a large degree of visual acuity in primates. The maturation of this primate visual acuity area is characterized by the shallowing and widening of the foveal pit, a decrease in the diameter of the rod-free zone, and packing of photoreceptor cells more densely into this area of the retina, which occurs sometime after birth. Maturation occurs concurrently with progressing age and development, which further correlates with increasing eye size, retinal length, and retinal area. These observations have led to the hypothesis that the maturation of the fovea might be a function of mechanical variables that remodel the retina. However, this has never been explored outside of primates. Here, we take advantage of the Anolis sagrei lizard, which has a bifoveated retina, to study maturation of the fovea and macula. Eyes were collected from male and female lizards from five different age groups - hatchling, 2-month, 4-month, 6-month, and adult. We found that Anolis maculae undergo a maturation process somewhat different than what has been observed in primates. Anole macular diameters actually increase in size and undergo minimal photoreceptor cell packing, possessing a near complete complement of these cells at the time of hatching. As the anole eye expands, foveal centers experience little change in overall retina cell density with most cell redistribution occurring at the macular borders and peripheral retina areas.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/529081v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (73K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@effd8dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ef65b3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fde14dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d2c0b2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Highlights- Foveal and retinal refinement occurs post-hatching into adulthood in anoles.\n- The temporal pit shallows and widens, whereas central pit morphology remains relatively constant with age.\n- Retina cell number within a section decreases as the eye grows larger with age.\n- Anole macular diameter increases from hatching to adult but does not increase proportionately to overall eye growth.",

    "abstract": "Genetic assimilation is the evolutionary process by which an environmentally induced phenotype becomes genetically encoded and constitutive. Genetic assimilation has been proposed as the concluding step in the plasticity-first model of environmental adaptation and has been observed in multiple species, but its prevalence has not been systematically investigated. By analyzing transcriptomic data collected upon reciprocal transplant, we address this question in the experimental evolution, domestication, or natural evolution of a bacterial, a fungal, a plant, and four animal species. We find that genetic assimilation of environment-induced gene expression is the exception rather than the rule and that substantially more genes retain than lose their expression plasticity upon organismal adaptations to new environments. The probability of genetic assimilation varies among genes and decreases with the number of transcription factors controlling the gene and the expression level of the gene, supporting the hypothesis that genetic assimilation results primarily from passive losses of gene regulations that are not mutationally robust. Therefore, at the level of gene expression, our findings argue against the purported importance of genetic assimilation to environmental adaptation.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of novel functions in biology relies heavily on gene duplication and divergence, creating large paralogous protein families. Selective pressure to avoid detrimental cross-talk often results in paralogs that exhibit exquisite specificity for their interaction partners. But how robust or sensitive is this specificity to mutation? Here, using deep mutational scanning, we demonstrate that a paralogous family of bacterial signaling proteins exhibits marginal specificity, such that many individual substitutions give rise to substantial cross-talk between normally insulated pathways. Our results indicate that sequence space is locally crowded despite overall sparseness, and we provide evidence that this crowding has constrained the evolution of bacterial signaling proteins. These findings underscore how evolution selects for  good enough rather than optimized phenotypes, leading to restrictions on the subsequent evolvability of paralogs.\n\nSignificance StatementLarge paralogous protein families are found throughout biology, the product of extensive gene duplication. To execute different functions inside cells, paralogs typically acquire different specificities, interacting with only desired, cognate partners and avoiding cross-talk with non-cognate proteins. But how robust is this interaction specificity to mutation? Can individual mutations lead to cross-talk or do paralogs diverge enough such that multiple mutations would be required, providing a mutational  buffer against cross-talk? To address these questions, we built mutant libraries that produce all possible single substitutions of a bacterial kinase and then screened for cross-talk to non-cognate proteins. Strikingly, we find that many single substitutions can produce cross-talk, meaning that these pathways typically exhibit only  marginal specificity, and demonstrate that this restricts their evolvability.",

    "abstract": "Y and W chromosomes often stop recombining and degenerate. Different theories have been proposed to explain these observations. The classic theory supposes that recombination arrest is favored because it allows to permanently link sex-antagonistic alleles to the sex in which they are favorable. The regulatory theory supposes that recombination arrest is initially caused by lucky inversions on the Y or W carrying fewer deleterious mutations than average, which then become selectively stabilized by the evolution of nascent dosage compensation creating sex-antagonistic regulatory effects. Last, the shelter theory also supposes that lucky Y (or W) inversions do occur, but that they are maintained in the long term because of a lack of genetic variation to restore recombination. The last two theories are comparable in the sense that they do not require sexually dimorphic traits, and are based primarily on the flux of deleterious mutations. In this paper, we focus on the shelter theory and show that contrarily to previous claims, it can hardly explain the evolution of sex chromosomes. We show that it is not robust to extremely low rates of recombination restoration, that it would cause population extinction rather than Y degeneration, and that it is orders of magnitudes less efficient than the mechanism described in the regulatory theory. We also argue that the assumption of a lack of genetic variation to restore recombination is unplausible given known mechanisms of recombination variation, and given the extremely small rates of restoration that are sufficient to make the shelter theory inoperant.",

    "abstract": "Mutations accumulate in the genome of every cell of the body throughout life, causing cancer and other genetic diseases1-4. Almost all of these mosaic mutations begin as nucleotide mismatches or damage in only one of the two strands of the DNA prior to becoming double-strand mutations if unrepaired or misrepaired5. However, current DNA sequencing technologies cannot resolve these initial single-strand events. Here, we developed a single-molecule, long-read sequencing method that achieves single-molecule fidelity for single-base substitutions when present in either one or both strands of the DNA. It also detects single-strand cytosine deamination events, a common type of DNA damage. We profiled 110 samples from diverse tissues, including from individuals with cancer-predisposition syndromes, and define the first single-strand mismatch and damage signatures. We find correspondences between these single-strand signatures and known double-strand mutational signatures, which resolves the identity of the initiating lesions. Tumors deficient in both mismatch repair and replicative polymerase proofreading show distinct single-strand mismatch patterns compared to samples deficient in only polymerase proofreading. In the mitochondrial genome, our findings support a mutagenic mechanism occurring primarily during replication. Since the double-strand DNA mutations interrogated by prior studies are only the endpoint of the mutation process, our approach to detect the initiating single-strand events at single-molecule resolution will enable new studies of how mutations arise in a variety of contexts, especially in cancer and aging.",

Recent progress in multiplexed 3D FISH imaging, single cell Hi-C and genome structure modeling allows a closer analysis of the structural variations of chromosomes between cells to infer the functional implications of structural heterogeneity. Here, we introduce a two-step dimensionality reduction method to classify a population of single cell 3D chromosome structures, either from simulation or imaging experiment, into dominant conformational clusters with distinct chromosome morphologies. We found that almost half of all structures for each chromosome can be described by 5-10 dominant chromosome morphologies, which play a fundamental role in establishing conformational variation of chromosomes. These morphologies are conserved in different cell types, but vary in their relative proportion of structures. Chromosome morphologies are distinguished by the presence or absence of characteristic chromosome territory domains, which expose some chromosomal regions to varying nuclear environments in different morphologies, such as nuclear positions and associations to nuclear speckles, lamina, and nucleoli. These observations point to distinct functional variations for the same chromosomal region in different chromosome morphologies. We validated chromosome conformational clusters and their associated subnuclear locations with data from DNA-MERFISH imaging and single cell sci-HiC data. Our method provides an important approach to assess the variation of chromosome structures between cells and link differences in conformational states with distinct gene functions.",

However, it has become evident that heterotrimeric G-proteins can also be activated via GPCR-independent mechanisms that remain untapped as pharmacological targets. GIV/Girdin has emerged as a prototypical non-GPCR activator of G proteins that promotes cancer metastasis. Here, we introduce IGGi-11, a first-in-class smallmolecule inhibitor of non-canonical activation of heterotrimeric G-protein signaling. IGGi-11 binding to G-protein -subunits (Gi) specifically disrupted their engagement with GIV/Girdin, thereby blocking non-canonical G-protein signaling in tumor cells, and inhibiting pro-invasive traits of metastatic cancer cells in vitro and in mice. In contrast, IGGi-11 did not interfere with canonical G-protein signaling mechanisms triggered by GPCRs. By revealing that small molecules can selectively disable non-canonical mechanisms of G-protein activation dysregulated in disease, these findings warrant the exploration of therapeutic modalities in G-protein signaling that go beyond targeting GPCRs.",

In this paper, we study the deformation of a membrane patch by an osmotic pressure through a nanopore on the cell wall. We find that there exists a critical pore size beyond which the membrane cannot stand against the pressure and would inflate out through the pore. The critical pore size scales exponentially with the membrane tension and the spontaneous curvature, and exhibits a power law dependence on the osmotic pressure. Our results also show that the liquid membrane expansion by pressure is mechanically different from the solid balloon expansion, and predict that the bending rigidity of the membrane in walled cells should be larger than that of the mammalian cells so as to prevent inflation through the pores on the cell wall.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant skipping of coding exons in CD19 and CD22 compromises responses to immunotherapy for B-cell malignancies. Here, we show that the MS4A1 gene encoding human CD20 also produces several mRNA isoforms with distinct 5 untranslated regions (5-UTR). Four variants (V1-4) were detectable by RNA-seq in distinct stages of normal B-cell differentiation and B-lymphoid malignancies, with V1 and V3 being the most abundant by far. During B-cell activation and Epstein-Barr virus infection, redirection of splicing from V1 to V3 coincided with increased CD20 positivity. Similarly, in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma only V3, but not V1, correlated with CD20 protein levels, suggesting that V1 might be translation-deficient. Indeed, the longer V1 isoform was found to contain upstream open reading frames (uORFs) and a stem-loop structure, which cooperatively inhibited polysome recruitment. By modulating CD20 isoforms with splice-switching Morpholino oligomers, we enhanced CD20 expression and anti-CD20 antibody rituximab-mediated cytotoxicity in a panel of B-cell lines. Furthermore, reconstitution of CD20-knockout cells with V3 mRNA led to the recovery of CD20 positivity, while V1-reconstituted cells had undetectable levels of CD20 protein. Surprisingly, in vitro CD20-directed CAR T cells were able to kill both V3- and V1-expressing cells, but the bispecific T cell engager mosunetuzumab was only effective against V3-expressing cells. To determine whether CD20 splicing is involved in immunotherapy resistance, we performed RNA-seq on four post-mosunetuzumab follicular lymphoma relapses and discovered that in two of them downregulation of CD20 was accompanied by the V3-to-V1 shift. Thus, splicing-mediated mechanisms of epitope loss extend to CD20-directed immunotherapies.\n\nKey PointsO_LIIn normal & malignant human B cells, CD20 mRNA is alternatively spliced into four 5-UTR isoforms, some of which are translation-deficient.\nC_LIO_LIThe balance between translation-deficient and -competent isoforms modulates CD20 protein levels & responses to CD20-directed immunotherapies\nC_LI\n\nExplanation of NoveltyWe discovered that in normal and malignant B-cells, CD20 mRNA is alternatively spliced to generate four distinct 5-UTRs, including the longer translation-deficient V1 variant. Cells predominantly expressing V1 were still sensitive to CD20-targeting chimeric antigen receptor T-cells. However, they were resistant to the bispecific anti-CD3/CD20 antibody mosunetuzumab, and the shift to V1 were observed in CD20-negative post-mosunetuzumab relapses of follicular lymphoma.",

    "abstract": "SummaryNucleic acid vaccines, including both RNA and DNA platforms, are key technologies that have considerable promise in combating both infectious disease and cancer. However, little is known about the extrinsic factors that regulate nucleic acid vaccine responses and which may determine their effectiveness. The microbiome is recognized as a significant regulator of immune development and response, whose role in regulating some traditional vaccine platforms has recently been discovered. Using germ-free and specific-pathogen-free mouse models in combination with different protein, DNA, and mRNA vaccine regimens, we demonstrate that the microbiome is a significant regulator of nucleic acid vaccine immunogenicity. While the presence of the microbiome enhances CD8+ T cell responses to mRNA lipid nanoparticle (LNP) immunization, the microbiome suppresses immunoglobulin and CD4+ T cell responses to DNA-prime, DNA-protein-boost immunization, indicating contrasting roles for the microbiome in the regulation of these different nucleic acid vaccine platforms. In the case of mRNA-LNP vaccination, germ-free mice display reduced dendritic cell/macrophage activation that may underlie the deficient vaccine response. Our study identifies the microbiome as a relevant determinant of nucleic acid vaccine response with implications for their continued therapeutic development and deployment.",

    "abstract": "Cells dynamically change their internal organization via continuous cell state transitions to mediate a plethora of physiological processes. Understanding such continuous processes is severely limited due to a lack of tools to measure the holistic physiological state of single cells undergoing a transition. We combined live-cell imaging and machine learning to quantitatively monitor skeletal muscle precursor cell (myoblast) differentiation during multinucleated muscle fiber formation. Our machine learning model predicted the continuous differentiation state of single primary murine myoblasts over time and revealed that inhibiting ERK1/2 leads to a gradual transition from an undifferentiated to a terminally differentiated state 7.5-14.5 hours post inhibition. Myoblast fusion occurred ~3 hours after predicted terminal differentiation. Moreover, we showed that our model could predict that cells have reached terminal differentiation under conditions where fusion was stalled, demonstrating potential applications in screening. This method can be adapted to other biological processes to reveal connections between the dynamic single-cell state and virtually any other functional readout.",

Here we assessed land-cover change in Cuba in the past 35 years and analyzed how this change may affect the distribution of Omphalea plants and Urania boisduvalii moths. We analyzed the vegetation cover of the Cuban archipelago between 1985 and 2020. We used Google Earth Engine to classify two satellite image compositions into seven cover types: forest and shrubs, mangrove, soil without vegetation cover, wetlands, pine forest, agriculture, and water bodies. We considered three different areas for quantifications of land-cover change: (1) protected areas, (2) areas of potential distribution of Omphalea, and (3) areas of potential distribution of the plant within the protected areas. We found that the category of \"forest and shrubs\" have increased significantly in Cuba in the past 35 years and that most of the gained forest and shrub areas were agricultural land in the past. This same pattern was observed in the areas of potential distribution of Omphalea; whereas almost all cover types were mostly stables inside the protected areas. The transformation of agricultural areas into forest and shrubs could represent an interesting opportunity for biodiversity conservation in Cuba. Other detailed studies about biodiversity composition in areas of forest and shrubs gain would greatly benefit our understanding on the value of such areas for conservation.",

    "abstract": "In the early 1980s, the observation that Drosophila melanogaster larvae differed in their foraging behavior laid the foundation for the work that would later lead to the discovery of the foraging gene (for) and its associated foraging phenotypes, rover and sitter. Since then, the molecular characterization of the for gene and our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain its allelic variants in the laboratory have progressed enormously. However, the significance and dynamics of such variation are yet to be investigated in nature. With the advent of next-generation sequencing, it is now possible to identify loci underlying adaptation of populations in response to environmental variation. Here, I present results of the first genotype-environment association analysis that quantifies variation at the for gene among samples of D. melanogaster structured across space and time. These samples consist of published genomes of adult flies collected worldwide, and at least twice per site of collection (during spring and fall). An analysis of genetic differentiation based on Fst and individual admixture estimates revealed an east-west gradient in population structure. The results indicate that different patterns of gene flow as expected under models of isolation by environment and isolation by distance are likely driving the genetic differentiation among populations. Overall, this study is essential for understanding the mechanisms underlying the evolution of foraging behavior in D. melanogaster.",

To understand the evolution and function of pausing, we analyzed transcription in 20 organisms across the tree of life. Unicellular eukaryotes have a slow acceleration of Pol II near transcription start sites that matured into a longer and more focused pause in metazoans. Increased pause residence time coincides with the evolution of new subunits in the NELF and 7SK complexes. In mammals, depletion of NELF reverts a focal pause to a proto-paused-like state driven in part by DNA sequence. Loss of this focal pause compromises transcriptional activation for a set of heat shock genes. Overall, we discovered how pausing evolved and increased regulatory complexity in metazoans.",

    "abstract": "Inside human nuclei, genes are transcribed within a highly packed genome, whose organization is facilitated by cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. However, whether cohesin-mediated loop extrusion participates in transcription is unknown. Here we report that the cohesin-mediated loop extrusion participates in transcription by forming a topoisomerases-regulated transcription elongation loop (TEL), in which cohesin is stalled at the transcription start site (TSS) and gradually extrudes loops asymmetrically until reaching the transcription termination site (TTS). By improving the spatial resolution of single-cell 3D genome mapping to 5 kb with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) in our new single-cell Micro-C (scMicro-C) method, we directly observed the loop expansion of TELs. Furthermore, TELs biological function is to ensure high transcriptional burst frequencies by fast re-initiation of RNA Pol II.\n\nOne-Sentence SummarySingle-cell high-resolution 3D genome structures reveal that cohesin-mediated loop extrusion participates in transcription.",

We find that copy number coupling between distinct plasmids in such systems allows for copy number buffering of an essential, but high-burden construct through the action of a stably maintained, nonessential plasmid. Plasmid coupling also generates population state memory without additional layers of regulatory control.

In this paper, we applied both niche-based and co-occurrence-based methods to estimate the dark diversity of vascular plant species in the subarctic tundra. We then aimed to unravel the drivers explaining (1) why some locations were missing relatively more suitable species than others, and (2) why certain plant species were more often absent from suitable locations than others.\n\nLocationThe Scandinavian tundra around Abisko, northern Sweden.\n\nMethodsWe calculated the dark diversity in 107 plots spread out across four mountain trails using four different methods. Two niche-based (Beals index and hypergeometric method) and two co-occurrences-based (climatic niche model and climatic niche model followed by species-specific threshold) methods. This was then followed by multiple generalized linear mixed models and general linear models to determine which habitat characteristics and species traits contributed most to the dark diversity.\n\nResultsThe study showed a notable divergence in the predicted drivers of dark diversity depending on the method used. Nevertheless, we can conclude that plot-level dark diversity was generally 18% higher in areas at low elevations and 30% and 10% higher in areas with a low species richness or low levels of habitat disturbance, respectively.\n\nConclusionOur findings call for caution when interpreting statistical findings of dark diversity estimates. Even so, all analyses point towards an important role for natural processes such as competitive dominance as main driver of the spatial patterns found in dark diversity in the northern Scandes.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics enable the acquisition of increasingly large datasets within relatively short times, which exposes bottlenecks in the bioinformatics pipeline. Whereas peptide identification is already scalable, most label-free quantification (LFQ) algorithms scale quadratic or cubic with the sample numbers, which may even preclude the analysis of large-scale data. Here we introduce directLFQ, a ratiobased approach for sample normalization and the calculation of protein intensities. It estimates quantities via aligning samples and ion traces by shifting them on top of each other in logarithmic space. Importantly, directLFQ scales linearly with the number of samples, allowing analyses of large studies to finish in minutes instead of days or months. We quantify 10,000 proteomes in 10 minutes and 100,000 proteomes in less than two hours - thousand-fold faster than some implementations of the popular LFQ algorithm MaxLFQ. In-depth characterization of directLFQ reveals excellent normalization properties and benchmark results, comparing favorably to MaxLFQ for both data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and data-independent acquisition (DIA). Additionally, directLFQ provides normalized peptide intensity estimates for peptide-level comparisons. It is available as an open-source Python package and as a GUI with a one-click installer and can be used in the AlphaPept ecosystem as well as downstream of most common computational proteomics pipelines.",

This is conventionally done in single-molecule force-spectroscopy (smFS) assays, for example with optical tweezers or Atomic Force Microscopy. While these techniques provide detailed mechanochemical insights, they are time-consuming, technically demanding and expensive; as a result, high-throughput screening of the mechanochemical properties of molecules of interest is challenging. To resolve this, we present a rapid, simple and low-cost mechanotyping assay: microfluidic force spectroscopy ({micro}FFS), which probes force-dependent bond stability by measuring the detachment of microparticles, bound to microfluidic channels by the interaction of interest, under hydrodynamic forcing. As this allows the simultaneous observation of hundreds of microparticles, we obtain a quantitative mechanotype in a single measurement, using readily available equipment. We validate our method by studying the stability of DNA duplexes, previously characterized through smFS. We further show that we can quantitatively describe the experimental data with simulations, which allows us to link the {micro}FFS data to single-bond mechanochemical properties.

    "abstract": "Urothelial cells, which play an essential role in the barrier function, are also thought to play a sensory role in bladder physiology by releasing signaling molecules in response to sensory stimuli that act upon adjacent sensory neurons. However, it is challenging to study this communication due to the overlap in receptor expression and proximity of urothelial cells to sensory neurons. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a mouse model where we can directly stimulate urothelial cells using optogenetics. We have crossed a uroplakin II-cre mouse (UPK2-Cre) with a mouse that expresses the light-activated cation channel, Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), in the presence of cre-expression. Optogenetic stimulation of urothelial cells cultured from UPK2-ChR2 initiates cellular depolarization and release of adenosine triphosphate. Cystometry recordings demonstrate that optical stimulation of urothelial cells increases bladder pressure and pelvic nerve activity. Increases in bladder pressure persisted, albeit to a lesser extent, when the bladder was excised in an in vitro preparation. The P2X receptor antagonist, PPADS, significantly reduced optically evoked bladder contractions in vivo and ex vivo. Further, corresponding nerve activity was also inhibited with PPADS. Our data suggest that urothelial cells can initiate robust bladder contractions via sensory nerve signaling or contractions through local signaling mechanisms. This data supports a foundation of literature demonstrating communication between sensory neurons and urothelial cells. Importantly, with further use of these optogenetic tools, we hope to scrutinize this signaling mechanism, its importance for normal micturition and nociception, and how it may be altered in pathophysiologic conditions.\n\nAnimal StudiesAll the procedures involving mice and mouse tissue performed in this study were approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and in strict accordance with the US National Institute of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nSignificanceIt has been appreciated for almost two decades that urothelial cells play a sensory role in bladder function. However, it has been particularly challenging to study this communication as both sensory neurons, and urothelial cells express the same sensory receptors. Here we demonstrate an optogenetic technique to specifically stimulate urothelial cells and evaluate the effects on bladder physiology. We used this technique to show that specific urothelial stimulation resulted in bladder contractions. This approach will have a long-lasting impact on how we study urothelial-to-sensory neuron communication and the changes that occur under disease conditions.",

    "abstract": "Histidine-containing dipeptides (HCDs) are pleiotropic homeostatic molecules linked to inflammatory, metabolic and neurological diseases, as well as exercise performance. Using a sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS approach and an optimized quantification method, we performed a systematic and extensive profiling of HCDs in the mouse, rat, and human body (in n=26, n=25, n=19 tissues, respectively). Our data show that tissue HCD levels are uniquely regulated by carnosine synthase (CARNS1), an enzyme that was preferentially expressed by fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers and brain oligodendrocytes. Cardiac HCD levels are remarkably low compared to other excitable tissues. Carnosine is unstable in human plasma, but is preferentially transported within red blood cells in humans but not rodents. The low abundant carnosine analog N-acetylcarnosine is the most stable plasma HCD, and is enriched in human skeletal muscles. Here, N-acetylcarnosine is continuously secreted into the circulation, which is further induced by acute exercise in a myokine-like fashion. Collectively, we provide a novel basis to unravel tissue-specific, paracrine, and endocrine roles of HCDs in human health and disease.\n\nSignificance statementBy extensively profiling the pluripotent histidine-containing dipeptides across three species, we generated many new insights into species- and tissue-specific histidine-containing dipeptide metabolism. For instance, the only stable analog that is specific for the human circulation (N-acetylcarnosine) is continuously released from muscle tissue and is positively regulated by physical exercise. The great number of analyses and experiments involving humans establishes great translational value of the findings. These new data open exciting opportunities to study histidine-containing dipeptide metabolism, including paracrine and/or endocrine signaling of these dipeptides, possibly contributing to the potent health-promoting exercise effects.",

    "abstract": "Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding efforts have increased grain yield predominantly by raising grain numbers per spikelet, rather than grain weight or spikelet number. However, across a single spike large differences exist in the number of grains per spikelet. The central spikelets produce the highest number of grains in any given genotype while apical and basal spikelets are less productive. Basal spikelets are delayed in development just after initiation and are smaller and less advanced than central spikelets already by the glume primordium stage. However, basal spikelets continue to develop and produce florets until much later in the wheat growth cycle. The precise timings or the cause of their growth cessation, and subsequent abortion, is largely unknown. In this study we investigated the underlying causes of rudimentary basal spikelet abortion. We investigated basal spikelet development in four UK winter wheat varieties as well as a set of near-isogenic lines for VRT-A2 (VEGETATIVE TO REPRODUCTIVE TRANSITION 2) using shading applications in the field. We propose that basal spikelet abortion is likely the consequence of complete floret abortion as both occur at the same time and have the same response to shading treatments. Furthermore, we found that the developmental age of florets pre-abortion is an important factor for their likelihood to survive and develop viable seed. Previously, it had been proposed that reduced assimilate availability in the base of the spike leads to increased abortion. Re-analysis of published data alongside data presented here, however, does not support this model. We found that rather than assimilate availability, it is the reduced developmental age of basal florets before abortion that correlates with increased abortion. Using the floret Waddington developmental stage pre-abortion, we were able to predict final grain set per spikelet across the spike, alongside the characteristic gradient in number of grains from basal to central spikelets. We found that advancing past Waddington stage 5.5 seems to be important for floret survival and that most florets in basal spikelets had not reached this stage at the onset of floret abortion. The abortion of all florets could therefore be the reason for their rudimentary appearance in the mature spike, suggesting that basal spikelet abortion is simply the consequence of all florets inside the spikelet being aborted and thus all other spikelet structures (e.g., lemma, rachilla, glume) also ceasing to develop. Future efforts to improve spikelet homogeneity across the spike could thus focus on improving basal spikelet establishment and increasing floret development rates pre-abortion.",

    "abstract": "Natural (genetic) parthenocarpy contributes to fruit yield and quality under unfavorable environmental conditions where there are no effective pollinators or fertile pollen grains. Several old melon cultivars and weedy melon in East Asia are known to have strong parthenocarpic ability, but there has been little progress in intentionally introducing this ability into current F1 hybrid cultivars. Here, we examined its inheritance and confirmed the selection accuracy of DNA markers linked to it. We conducted QTL analysis using three F2 populations derived from crosses between a non-parthenocarpic cultivar and three parthenocarpic accessions, and detected two major QTLs on chromosomes 2 (par2.1) and 3 (par3.1). The parthenocarpic parent allele at both QTLs enhanced parthenocarpic ability. Phenotypic segregation was well explained by par2.1 and par3.1 in two F2 populations derived from Japanese weedy melon and an old Korean cultivar and by par3.1 in one from an old Japanese cultivar. This difference suggests that the effects of par2.1 and par 3.1 depend on genetic background. Both QTL regions contain several phytohormone-related genes, so we randomly selected SNPs in auxin- and ethylene-related genes to confirm the accuracy of selection for parthenocarpic ability. These SNP markers proved sufficient, though not perfect, to select plants with strong parthenocarpic ability. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of parthenocarpic ability in melon and will contribute to the development of new cultivars with high parthenocarpic ability.\n\nKey messageSeveral oriental melons have strong parthenocarpic ability controlled by one or two loci. DNA markers linked to these loci can select individuals with this ability.",

    "abstract": "Virtual reality has been used for a variety of training and gaming purposes. Recent studies have demonstrated their use in higher education enhances student engagement and positively impacts student performance. In this study, we implemented 360-degree video in an introductory biology lab and assessed student attitudes, engagement, and performance on various assessments as well as the overall course performance. Students were extremely positive about virtual reality, had minimal issues handling the technology, and indicated that engagement with the topic was better with virtual reality. Student performance increased on 2 of the 3 formative assessments analyzed, 1 of 1 summative assessment analyzed, and overall course grades in semesters with virtual reality were higher than in semesters without virtual reality. These results suggest virtual reality in higher education may enhance not only student engagement and performance, but also enhance student attitude about the topic.",
