    "abstract": "Occupancy models have been extended to account for either multiple spatial scales or species interactions in a dynamic setting. However, as interacting species (e.g., predators and prey) often operate at different spatial scales, including nested spatial structure might be especially relevant to models of interacting species. Here we bridge these two model frameworks by developing a multi-scale, two-species occupancy model. The model is dynamic, i.e. it estimates initial occupancy, colonization and extinction probabilities--including probabilities conditional to the other species presence. With a simulation study, we demonstrate that the model is able to estimate most parameters without marked bias under low, medium and high average occupancy probabilities, as well as low, medium and high detection probabilities, with only a small bias for some parameters in low-detection scenarios. We further evaluate the models ability to deal with sparse field data by applying it to a multi-scale camera trapping dataset on a mustelid-rodent predator-prey system. Most parameters are estimated with low uncertainty (i.e. narrow posterior distributions). More broadly, our model framework creates opportunities to explicitly account for the spatial structure found in many spatially nested study designs, and to study interacting species that have contrasting movement ranges with camera traps.",

    "abstract": "The recognition of different microbe-associated molecular patterns in the rhizosphere triggers in the plant root the activation of either an immune response or an accommodation program. In both types of responses, Ca2+ is a crucial intracellular messenger, mediating the early stages of the respective signalling pathways. In this work, we analysed the cytosolic and nuclear Ca2+ changes activated by a set of chitin-related oligomers in different genetic backgrounds of Lotus japonicus roots by using specifically targeted aequorin-based Ca2+ reporters. By means of pharmacological and genetic approaches, we dissected the Ca2+ signal into two temporally distinct components: a rapid initial transient, followed by a longer and milder elevation in Ca2+ concentration. Taking advantage of a complementary analysis using a cameleon-based bioassay in Medicago truncatula root organ cultures, we showed that the second phase can be interpreted as the Ca2+ spiking that is widely described in response to the perception of symbiotic signals. By contrast, the rapid first phase, critically dependent on elicitor concentration, was found to correlate with the activation of plant immunity marker genes. Overall, our study provides novel clues to a better understanding of the subtle boundaries between symbiotic and immunity responses in root-fungus interactions.\n\nHighlightIntracellular calcium changes induced in Lotus japonicus roots by fungal signals were dissected in two separate phases, relying on distinct genetic programs and differentially mediating plant symbiotic or immunity responses.",

    "abstract": "Heterospecific communication is common for birds when mobbing a predator. However, joining the mob should depend on the number of callers already enrolled, as larger mobs imply lower individual risks for the newcomer. In addition, some  community informant species seem more reliable regarding the information transferred in mobbing calls. Birds should therefore rely on both the number of callers and the species identity of the caller(s) when mobbing. In the present study, we tested the potential interaction between two acoustic cues. In a playback experiment, we modified the number of callers (through an increased number of calling individuals correlated to an increased duty cycle) and the emitter species (crested tits versus coal tits). Overall, we found that soundtracks with three callers triggered more mobbing than soundtracks with one caller and that soundtracks with coal tits calls triggered more mobbing than soundtracks with crested tits calls. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that birds consider both the species and the number of callers when joining a mobbing chorus in winter. Finally, we replicated the experiment in spring and did not record the same responses from the bird community. Indeed, only soundtracks with three coal tits triggered a mobbing response, suggesting therefore that the seasonal context can affect the results of studies on heterospecific communication. The potential mechanisms implicated in the varying responses to different acoustic cues and different seasons are discussed and should deserve further investigations.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules (MTs) are built from -/{beta}-tubulin dimers and used as tracks by kinesin and dynein motors to transport a variety of cargos, such as mRNAs, proteins, and organelles, within the cell. Tubulins are subjected to several post-translational modifications (PTMs). Glutamylation is one of them, and it is responsible for adding one or more glutamic acid residues as branched peptide chains to the C-terminal tails of both - and {beta}-tubulin. However, very little is known about the specific modifications found on the different tubulin isotypes in vivo and the role of these PTMs in MT transport and other cellular processes in vivo. In this study, we found that in Drosophila ovaries, glutamylation of -tubulin isotypes occurred clearly on the C-terminal ends of Tub84B and Tub84D (Tub84B/D). In contrast, the ovarian -tubulin, Tub67C, is not glutamylated. The C-terminal ends of Tub84B/D are glutamylated at several glutamyl side chains in various combinations. Drosophila TTLL5 is required for the mono- and poly-glutamylation of ovarian Tub84B/D and with this for the proper localization of glutamylated microtubules. Similarly, proper Kinesin-1 distribution in the germline also depends on TTLL5 as well as the refining of Staufen localization and the normal fast ooplasmic streaming with its directional movement, two processes known to depend on Kinesin-1 activities. In the nervous system, the pausing of anterograde axonal transport of mitochondria is affected by an enzymatically dead mutant of TTLL5. Our results demonstrate in vivo roles of TTLL5 in differential glutamylation of -tubulins and point to the in vivo importance of -tubulin glutamylation for Kinesin-1-dependent processes.\n\nSummaryO_LI-tubulin glutamylation was established in the C-terminal domain of Drosophila Tub84B and Tub84D (Tub84B/D).

PACS1 plays roles in the endosomal pathway and nucleus, but little is known about how this variant affects developing neurons and patients have few therapeutic options. Here, we used stem cellderived models to show that PACS1(+/R203W) neurons have impaired expression of genes enriched for synaptic signaling processes. We assessed the functional impact of this differential expression and find that PACS1(+/R203W) neurons have a striking prolongation of network burst duration resulting from an increased inter-spike interval. These results suggest that an aberrant regulation of ionic flux affecting spike frequency underlies the neurological phenotypes experienced by patients.

    "abstract": "Organic Farming (OF) has been expanding recently in response to growing consumer demand and as a response to environmental concerns. The area under OF is expected to further increase in the future. The effect of OF expansion on pest densities in organic and conventional crops remains difficult to predict because OF expansion impacts Conservation Biological Control (CBC), which depends on the surrounding landscape (i.e. both the crop mosaic and semi-natural habitats). In order to understand and forecast how pests and their biological control may vary during OF expansion, we modeled the effect of spatial changes in farming practices on population dynamics of a pest and its natural enemy. We investigated the impact on pest density and on predator to pest ratio of three contrasted scenarios aiming at 50% organic fields through the progressive conversion of conventional fields. Scenarios were 1) conversion of Isolated conventional fields first (IP), 2) conversion of conventional fields within Groups of conventional fields first (GP), and 3) Random conversion of conventional field (RD). We coupled a neutral spatially explicit landscape model to a predator-prey model to simulate pest dynamics in interaction with natural enemy predators. The three OF expansion scenarios were applied to nine landscape contexts differing in their proportion and fragmentation of semi-natural habitat. We further investigated if the ranking of scenarios was robust to pest control methods in OF fields and pest and predator dispersal abilities.\n\nWe found that organic farming expansion affected more predator densities than pest densities for most combinations of landscape contexts and OF expansion scenarios. The impact of OF expansion on final pest and predator densities was also stronger in organic than conventional fields and in landscapes with large proportions of highly fragmented semi-natural habitats. Based on pest densities and the predator to pest ratio, our results suggest that a progressive organic conversion with a focus on isolated conventional fields (scenario IP) could help promote CBC. Careful landscape planning of OF expansion appeared most necessary when pest management was substantially less efficient in organic than in conventional crops, and in landscapes with low proportion of semi-natural habitats.",

Here, we demonstrate that mouse CMV (MCMV), a {beta}-herpesvirus, persists for the long term and across organs in PDGFR+ fibroblastic cells, with similar or higher genome loads than in the previously known sites of MCMV latency. Whereas MCMV gene transcription in PDGFR+ fibroblastic cells was almost completely silenced at 5 months post-infection, these cells gave rise to reactivated virus ex vivo, arguing that they supported latent MCMV infection. Notably, PDGFR+ fibroblastic cells also supported productive virus replication during primary MCMV infection. Mechanistically, Stat1-deficiency resulted in increased lytic but abolished latent infection of fibroblastic cells in vivo. In sum, fibroblastic cells have a dual role as a site of lytic MCMV replication and a reservoir of latent MCMV in vivo and Stat1 is critically involved in the regulation of MCMV latency.",

    "abstract": "The current state-of-the-art infection and antimicrobial resistance diagnostics (AMR) is based mainly on culture-based methods with a detection time of 48-96 hours. Slow diagnoses lead to adverse patient outcomes that directly correlate with the time taken to administer optimal antimicrobials. Mortality risk doubles with a 24-hour delay in providing appropriate antibiotics in cases of bacteremia. Therefore, it is essential to develop novel methods that can promptly and accurately diagnose microbial infections at both species and strain levels in clinical settings. Here, we demonstrate that the complimentary use of label-free optical assay with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can enable high-speed culture-free diagnosis of infection and AMR. Our assay is based on microscopy methods exploiting label-free, highly sensitive quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) followed by deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) based classification. We benchmarked our proposed workflow on 21 clinical isolates from four WHO priority pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii) that were antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) phenotyped, and their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profile was determined by WGS. The proposed optical assay was in good agreement with the WGS characterization. Highly accurate classification based on the gram staining (100% for gram-negative and 83.4% for gram-positive), species (98.6%), and resistant/susceptible type (96.4%), as well as at the individual strain level (100% accurate in predicting 19 out of the 21 strains). These results demonstrate the potential of the QPM assay as a rapid and first-stage tool for species, presence, and absence of AMR, and strain-level classification, which WGS can follow up for confirmation of the pathogen ID and the characterization of the AMR profile and susceptibility antibiotic. Taken together, all this information is of high clinical importance. Such a workflow could potentially facilitate efficient antimicrobial stewardship and prevent the spread of AMR.",

    "abstract": "We perform targeted attack, a systematic computational unlinking of the network, to analyze its effects on global communication across the network through its giant cluster. Across diffusion magnetic resonance images from individuals in the UK Biobank, Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study and Developing Human Connectome Project, we find that targeted attack procedures on increasing white matter tract lengths and densities are remarkably invariant to aging and disease. Time-reversing the attack computation suggests a mechanism for how brains develop, for which we derive an analytical equation using percolation theory. Based on a close match between theory and experiment, our results demonstrate that tracts are limited to emanate from regions already in the giant cluster and tracts that appear earliest in neurodevelopment are those that become the longest and densest.\n\nSignificanceAs brains develop through neural growth and specialization, what mechanism ensures that new neurons are integrated into a fully connected brain, avoiding \"bridges to nowhere\"? Here, we study brain structure development from the perspective of percolation, a global measure of communication. Analyzing over 35,000 diffusion MRI scans on human individuals, from newborns to adults, we identify the following rules of brain neurogenesis through percolation theory: earlier tracts become longer and denser while maintaining a giant cluster. This signature, invariant to age or mental health, suggests a fundamental condition for the brain to function as an emergent whole.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular phase separation has emerged as an essential mechanism for cellular organization. How cells respond to environmental stimuli in a robust and sensitive manner to build functional condensates at the proper time and location is only starting to be understood. Recently, lipid membranes have been recognized as an important regulatory center for biomolecular condensation. However, how the interplay between the phase behaviors of cellular membranes and surface biopolymers may contribute to the regulation of surface condensation remains to be elucidated. Using simulations and a mean-field theoretical model, we show that two key factors are the membranes tendency to phase separate and the surface polymers ability to reorganize local membrane composition. Surface condensate forms with high sensitivity and selectivity in response to features of biopolymer when positive co-operativity is established between coupled growth of the condensate and local lipid domains. This effect relating the degree of membrane-surface polymer co-operativity and condensate property regulation is shown to be robust by different ways of tuning the co-operativity, such as varying membrane protein obstacle concentration, lipid composition and the affinity between lipid and polymer. The general physical principle emerged from the current analysis may have implications in other biological processes and beyond.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of gene expression is constrained by the topology of gene regulatory networks, as co-expressed genes are likely to have their expressions affected together by mutations. Conversely, co-expression can also be an advantage when genes are under joint selection. Here, we assessed theoretically whether correlated selection (selection for a combination of traits) was able to affect the pattern of correlated gene expressions and the underlying gene regulatory networks. We ran individual-based simulations, applying a stabilizing correlated fitness function to three genetic architectures: a quantitative genetics (multilinear) model featuring epistasis and pleiotropy, a quantitative genetics model where each genes has an independent mutational structure, and a gene regulatory model, mimicking the mechanisms of gene expression regulation. Simulations showed that correlated mutational effects evolved in the three genetic architectures as a response to correlated selection, but the response in gene networks was specific. The intensity of gene co-expression was mostly explained by the regulatory distance between genes (largest correlations being associated to genes directly interacting with each other), and the sign of co-expression was associated with the nature of the regulation (transcription activation or inhibition). These results concur to the idea that gene network topologies could partly reflects past correlated selection patterns on gene expression.",

    "abstract": "About 70% of human cleavage stage embryos show chromosomal mosaicism, falling to 20% in blastocysts. Chromosomally mosaic human blastocysts can implant and lead to healthy new-borns with normal karyotypes. Studies in mouse embryos and human gastruloids have shown that aneuploid cells show proteotoxic stress, autophagy and p53 activation and that they are eliminated from the epiblast by apoptosis while being rather tolerated in the trophectoderm. These observations suggest a selective loss of aneuploid cells from human embryos, but the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In this study we investigated the cellular consequences of aneuploidy in a total of 85 human blastocysts. RNA-sequencing of trophectoderm cells showed transcriptional signatures of a deregulated p53 pathway and apoptosis, which was proportionate to the level of chromosomal imbalance. Immunostaining revealed that aneuploidy triggers proteotoxic stress, autophagy and apoptosis in aneuploid embryos. Total cell numbers were lower in aneuploid embryos, due to a decline both in trophectoderm and in epiblast/primitive endoderm cell numbers. While lower cell numbers in trophectoderm may be attributed to apoptosis, it appeared that aneuploidy impairs the second lineage segregation and primitive endoderm formation in particular. Our findings might explain why fully aneuploid embryos fail to further develop and we hypothesize that the same mechanisms lead to removal of aneuploid cells from mosaic embryos. This hypothesis needs further study as we did not analyse chromosomal mosaic embryos. Finally, we demonstrated clear differences with previous findings in the mouse, emphasizing the need for human embryo research to understand the consequences of aneuploidy.",

    "abstract": "Coevolutionary relationships between parasites and their hosts can lead to the emergence of diverse phenotypes over time, as seen in Ophiocordyceps fungi that manipulate insect and arachnid behaviour to aid fungal spore transmission. The most conspicuous examples are found in ants of the Camponotini tribe, colloquially known as \"zombie ants\". While the behaviours induced during infection are well described, their molecular underpinnings remain unknown. Recent genomics and transcriptomics analyses of Ophiocordyceps camponoti-floridani have identified several highly upregulated biomolecules produced by the fungus during infection of Camponotus floridanus. Among them is an ergot alkaloid related to the mycotoxin aflatrem, known to cause \"staggers syndrome\" in cows. Staggering, defined as unsteady movements side to side, is also observed in C. floridanus ants during late-stage infection. To test if aflatrem-like compounds could be responsible, we injected healthy ants with aflatrem and recorded their behaviour for 30 minutes. Using both the automated object-tracking software MARGO and manual behavioural quantification, we found that aflatrem reduced ant activity and speed, and increased staggering behaviours. To examine underlying transcriptomic changes, we performed RNA-Seq on the heads of aflatrem-injected ants, keeping in step with previous transcriptomic work on Ophiocordyceps-manipulated ants. We identified 261 genes that were significantly dysregulated in the aflatrem-injected ants compared to sham-injected controls. When compared with RNA-Seq data from Ophiocordyceps-manipulated ants, we found that both groups shared 113 differentially regulated genes. These included sensory neuron membrane protein genes, several odorant-binding protein genes, and musculoskeletal genes such as titin and obscurin. Together, these results indicate that aflatrem-like compounds significantly affect neuromuscular and sensory function in C. floridanus. The conservation of staggers phenotype between C. floridanus and Bos taurus suggests that behaviour manipulating strategies exhibited across the Tree of Life may be more similar in approach, if not widely different in application, than we realize.",

    "abstract": "High sequencing errors have impeded the application of long noisy reads for diploid genome assembly. Most existing assemblers failed to distinguish heterozygotes from high sequencing errors in long noisy reads and generate collapsed assemblies with lots of haplotype switches. Here, we present PECAT, a phased error correction and assembly tool for reconstructing diploid genomes from long noisy reads. We design a haplotype-aware error correction method that can retain heterozygote alleles while correcting sequencing errors. We develop a read-level SNP caller that can further reduce the SNP errors in corrected reads. Then, we use a read grouping method to assign reads to different haplotype groups. To accelerate the assembling, PECAT only performs local alignment when it is necessary. PECAT efficiently assembles diploid genomes using only long noisy reads and generates more contiguous haplotype-specific contigs compared to other assemblers. Especially, PECAT achieves nearly haplotype-resolved assembly on B. taurus (BisonxSimmental) using Nanopore reads.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanism of rejuvenation is central to aging research. No study has compared the effects of the four major rejuvenation strategies: senolytics, caloric restriction, in vivo partial cellular reprogramming and young/old blood factor exchange, which operate via different modalities. We use mice transcriptional data to compare them to each other and to normal aging. We find a shared gene expression program common to all rejuvenation strategies, in which inflammation declines and metabolism, especially of fatty acids, increases. An inverse signature occurs in normal aging. To test whether inflammation is upstream of the metabolic signature, we studied chronic inflammation in three different organs in young mice. Chronic inflammation was associated with a similar decline in metabolism, suggesting that inflammation is upstream of the metabolic signature. We find that inflammation may also underlie human transcriptional age calculator. We conclude that a core mechanism of rejuvenation acts through reduction of inflammation with downstream effects that enhance metabolism, attenuating the most robust age-related changes. This supports a notion of directly targeting genes associated with these pathways to mitigate age-related deterioration.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous activity of neural cells is a hallmark of the developing nervous system. It is widely accepted that chemical signals, like neurotransmitters, contribute to spontaneous activity in the nervous system. Here we reveal an additional mechanism of spontaneous activity that is mechanosensitive in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) using intravital imaging of growing dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in zebrafish embryos. GCaMP6s imaging shows that developing DRG satellite glia contain distinct spontaneous Ca2+ transients, classified into simultaneous, isolated and microdomains. Longitudinal analysis over days in development demonstrates that as DRG satellite glia become more synchronized, isolated Ca2+ transients remain constant. Using a chemical screen, we identify that Ca2+ transients in DRG glia are dependent on mechanical properties, which we confirmed using an experimental application of mechanical force. We find that isolated spontaneous Ca2+ transients of the glia during development is altered by manipulation of mechanosensitive protein Piezo1, which is expressed in the developing ganglia. In contrast, simultaneous Ca2+ transients of DRG satellite glia is not Piezo1-mediated, thus demonstrating that distinct mechanisms mediate subtypes of spontaneous Ca2+ transients. Activating Piezo1 eventually impacts the cell abundance of DRG cells and behaviors that are driven by DRG neurons. Together, our results reveal mechanistically distinct subtypes of Ca2+ transients in satellite glia and introduce mechanobiology as a critical component of spontaneous activity in the developing peripheral nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are micrometer scale minimal cellular mimics that are useful for synthetic biology and drug delivery. Unlike assembly in low-salt solutions, assembly of GUVs in solutions with ionic concentrations of 100-150 mM Na/KCl (salty solutions) is challenging. Chemical compounds deposited on the substrate or in the lipid mixture could assist in the assembly of GUVs. Here, we investigate quantitatively the effects of temperature and chemical identity of six assisting polymeric and small molecule compounds on the molar yields of GUVs composed of three different lipid mixtures using high resolution confocal microscopy and large dataset image analysis. All the polymers moderately increased the yields of GUVs either at 22 or 37 degrees Celsius, whereas the small molecule compound was ineffective. Low gelling temperature agarose is the singular compound that consistently produces yields of GUVs of greater than 10 %. We propose a free energy model of budding to explain the effects of polymers in assisting the assembly of GUVs. The osmotic pressure exerted on the membranes by the dissolved polymer balances the increased adhesion between the membranes, thus reducing the free energy for bud formation. Data obtained by modulating the ionic strength and ion valency of the solution shows that the evolution of the yield of GUVs support our models prediction. In addition, polymer specific interactions with the substrate and the lipid mixture effects yields. The uncovered mechanistic insight provides a quantitative experimental and theoretical framework to guide future studies. Additionally, this work shows a facile means for obtaining GUVs in solutions of physiological ionic strengths.",

    "abstract": "A persons cognitive state determines how their brain responds to visual stimuli. The most common such effect is a response enhancement when stimuli are task-relevant and attended rather than ignored. In this fMRI study, we report a surprising twist on such attention effects in the visual word form area (VWFA), a region that plays a key role in reading. We presented participants with strings of letters and visually similar shapes which were either relevant for a specific task (lexical decision or gap localization) or ignored (during a fixation dot color task). In the VWFA, the enhancement of responses to attended stimuli occurred only for letter strings, whereas the shapes evoked smaller responses when attended than when ignored. The enhancement of VWFA activity was accompanied by strengthened functional connectivity with higher-level language regions. These task-dependent modulations of response magnitude and functional connectivity were specific to the VWFA and absent in the rest of visual cortex. We suggest that language regions send targeted excitatory feedback into the VWFA only when the observer is trying to read. This feedback enables the discrimination of familiar and nonsense words, and is distinct from generic effects of visual attention.",

    "abstract": "Perception and adaptive decision making rely on the integration of incoming sensory input with prior knowledge or expectations. While tactile stimuli play a significant role in shaping our perception and decision making, if and how prior information modulates the representation of tactile stimuli in early somatosensory cortices is largely unknown. Here, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a vibrotactile detection paradigm to study the effect of prior information on tactile perception and tactile stimulus representation in early somatosensory areas. The supra-voxel somatotopic organization of early somatosensory areas allowed us to assess the effect of prior information on finger-specific representations. We found that vibrotactile stimuli congruent with expectations are associated with improved vibrotactile detection performance and a decrease of the mean blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Concurrently, finger-specific activity associated with anticipated vibrotactile stimulation revealed higher multivariate decoding accuracies and better alignment with S1s somatotopic organization. In addition, we observed that prior information induced somatotopically organized activity in contralateral S1 even before tactile stimulation onset. The accuracy of the multivariate decoding of stimulus-specific expectations was therefore strongly associated with upcoming behavioral detection performance. Thus, our results reveal a role for S1 in the integration of upcoming tactile stimuli with prior information based on its somatotopic organization as well as the presence of behaviorally relevant activity in S1 before stimulation onset.",

    "abstract": "Several genera of desert ants have adapted to endure prolonged exposure to high temperatures. The study of these ants is essential to unravel how species respond and adapt to thermal stress. We investigated the thermal tolerance and the transcriptomic heat stress response of three desert ant genera (Cataglyphis, Melophorus and Ocymyrmex) and two temperate genera (Formica and Myrmica) to explore convergent and specific adaptations. We found a variable transcriptomic response among desert species exposed to similar levels of physiological heat-stress: Cataglyphis holgerseni and Melophorus bagoti differentially regulated very few transcripts, 0.12% (54/44,525) and 0.14% (53/38,726) respectively, while Cataglyphis bombycina and Ocymyrmex robustior showed greater expression alterations affecting 0.6% (253/41,912) and 1.53% (698/45,701) of their transcriptomes, respectively. These two responsive mechanisms - reactive and constitutive - were related to desert species thermal tolerance survival pattern and convergently evolved in distinct desert ant genera. By comparison, the two temperate species differentially expressed thousands of transcripts more than desert ants in response to heat stress (affecting 8% and 12,71% of F. fusca and Myr. sabuleti transcriptomes), suggesting that keeping restrained gene expression is an important adaptation in heat adapted species. Finally, we found a significant overlap of the molecular pathways activated in response to heat-stress in temperate and desert species, and our data revealed that larger gene expression responses also affected a greater number of taxonomically restricted genes. These results suggest that the molecular processes involved in heat-stress response are mostly evolutionary conserved in ants, but new genes may also play a role.",

Centrioles appear in 2-4 cell embryos in fertilized oocytes and in parthenogenetic embryos. Centriole formation includes the appearance of atypical centrioles with randomly arranged triplets and centrioles with microtubule triplets of various lengths. After the third cleavage, four centriolar cylinders for the first time appear in the blastomeres while each embryo still has two atypical centrioles.

    "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum accounts for the majority of over 600000 malaria-associated deaths annually. Parasites resistant to nearly all antimalarials have emerged and the need for drugs with alternative modes of action is thus undoubted. The FK506-binding protein PfFKBP35 has gained attention as a promising drug target due to its high affinity to the macrolide compound FK506 (tacrolimus). Whilst there is considerable interest in targeting PfFKBP35 with small molecules, a genetic validation of this factor as a drug target is missing and its function in parasite biology remains elusive. Here, we show that limiting PfFKBP35 levels are lethal to P. falciparum and result in a delayed death-like phenotype that is characterized by defective ribosome homeostasis and stalled protein synthesis. Our data furthermore suggest that FK506, unlike the action of this drug in model organisms, exerts its anti-proliferative activity in a PfFKBP35-independent manner and, using cellular thermal shift assays, we identify putative FK506-targets beyond PfFKBP35. In addition to revealing first insights into the function of PfFKBP35, our results show that FKBP-binding drugs can adopt non-canonical modes of action - with major implications for the development of FK506-derived molecules active against Plasmodium parasites and other eukaryotic pathogens.",

Priori utilizes literature-supported regulatory relationship information to identify known transcription factor target genes. Using these transcriptional relationships, Priori uses linear models to determine the impact and direction of transcription factor regulation on the expression of its target genes. In our work, we evaluated the ability of Priori and 16 other methods to detect aberrant activity from 124 single-gene perturbation experiments. We show that Priori identifies perturbed transcription factors with greater sensitivity and specificity than other methods.

    "abstract": "The stringent response, which leads to persistence of nutrient-starved mycobacteria, is induced by activation of the RelA/SpoT homologue (Rsh) upon entry of a deacylated-tRNA in a translating ribosome. However, the mechanism by which Rsh identifies such ribosomes in vivo remains unclear. Here, we show that conditions inducing ribosome hibernation result in loss of intracellular Rsh in a Clp protease-dependent manner. This loss is also observed in non-starved cells using mutations in Rsh that block its interaction with the ribosome, indicating that Rsh association with the ribosome is important for Rsh stability. The cryo-EM structure of the Rsh-bound 70S ribosome in a translation initiation complex reveals unknown interactions between the ACT domain of Rsh and components of the ribosomal L7/L12-stalk base, suggesting that the aminoacylation status of A-site tRNA is surveyed during the first cycle of elongation. Altogether, we propose a surveillance model of Rsh activation that originates from its constitutive interaction with the ribosomes entering the translation cycle.\n\nSignificanceBacteria persist under nutrient starvation by activating RelA/SpoT homologue (Rsh), which synthesizes a growth regulating alarmone, ppGpp. Rsh is activated specifically upon recognizing a translation elongation complex with deacylated tRNA at the A-site. It is however unclear how Rsh identifies such a complex in vivo. We show here that conditions inducing ribosome hibernation in mycobacteria cause loss of intracellular Rsh, implying that association with translating ribosomes is necessary for intracellular stability of Rsh. Using structural analysis of Rsh-bound 70S translation initiation complex, we propose here that mycobacterial Rsh identifies a Rsh-activating ribosomal complex by constitutively surveying the ribosome entering the translation cycle at the early elongation stage.",

    "abstract": "Signaling pathways can produce digital invariant outputs and analog outputs that scale with the amount of stimulation. In IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling both types of outputs require the Myddosome, a multi-protein complex. The Myddosome is required for polyubiquitin chain formation and NF-kB signaling. However, the ways in which these signals are spatially and temporally regulated to drive switch-like and proportional outcomes is not understood. We find that during IL-1R signaling, Myddosomes dynamically re-organize into large, multi-Myddosome clusters at the cell membrane. Blockade of Myddosome clustering using nanoscale extracellular barriers reduces NF-kB activation. We find that Myddosomes function as a scaffold that assembles an NF-kB signalosome consisting of E3-ubiquitin ligases TRAF6 and LUBAC, K63/M1-linked polyubiquitin chains, phospho-IKK, and phospho-p65. This signalosome preferentially assembles at regions of high Myddosome density, which enhances the recruitment of TRAF6 and LUBAC. Extracellular barriers that restrict Myddosome clustering perturbed the recruitment of both ligases. We found that LUBAC was especially sensitive to clustering with a sevenfold lower recruitment to single Myddosomes than clustered Myddosomes. This data reveals that the clustering behavior of Myddosome provides the basis for digital and analog IL-1R signaling.",

    "abstract": "The periplasmic (NAP) and membrane-associated (Nar) nitrate reductases of Paracoccus denitrificans are responsible for nitrate reduction under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. Expression of NAP is elevated in cells grown on a relatively reduced carbon and energy source (such as butyrate); it is believed that NAP contributes to redox homeostasis by coupling nitrate reduction to the disposal of excess reducing equivalents. Here we show that deletion of either dksA1 (encoding one of two dksA homologs in the P. denitrificans genome) or relA/spoT (encoding a bifunctional ppGpp synthetase and hydrolase) eliminates the butyrate-dependent increase in nap promoter and NAP enzyme activity. We conclude that ppGpp likely signals growth on a reduced substrate and, together with DksA1, mediates increased expression of the genes encoding NAP. Support for this model comes from the observation that nap promoter activity is increased in cultures exposed to a protein synthesis inhibitor that is known to trigger ppGpp synthesis in other organisms. We also show that, under anaerobic growth conditions, the redox-sensing RegAB two-component pair acts as a negative regulator of NAP expression and as a positive regulator of expression of the membrane-associated nitrate reductase Nar. The dksA1 and relA/spoT genes are conditionally synthetically lethal; the double mutant has a null phenotype for growth on butyrate and other reduced substrates while growing normally on succinate and citrate. We also show that the second dksA homolog (dksA2) and relA/spoT have roles in regulation of expression of the flavohemoglobin Hmp and in biofilm formation.\n\nIMPORTANCEParacoccus denitrificans is a metabolically versatile Gram-negative bacterium that is used as a model for studies of respiratory metabolism. The organism can utilize nitrate as an electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration, reducing it to dinitrogen via nitrite, nitric oxide, and nitrous oxide. This pathway (known as denitrification) is important as a route for loss of fixed nitrogen from soil and as a source of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. Thus, it is important to understand those environmental and genetic factors that govern flux through the denitrification pathway. Here we identify four proteins and a small molecule (ppGpp) which function as previously unknown regulators of expression of enzymes that reduce nitrate and oxidize nitric oxide.",

Here, we set out to improve our understanding of such remarkable genetics by resolving the nuclear genomes of all publicly available AMF heterokaryons using PacBio HiFi and Hi-C sequencing. We find that all AMF heterokaryons carry two sets of homologous chromosomes, where genes associated with plant colonization reside in gene-sparse, repeat-rich compartments. The co-existing nuclear genomes are phylogenetically related but differ significantly in content and epigenetics, resulting in nucleus-specific regulatory programs during mycorrhizal interactions. AMF heterokaryons carry signatures of past genetic exchange indicative of sexual reproduction, followed by clonal haplotype evolution. This work uncovers the contribution and origin of nuclear genomes present in AMF heterokaryons and opens avenues for improvement and environmental application of these strains.",

To study the molecular mechanisms linking Muller glia reactivity to progenitor production and neuronal differentiation, we used single cell RNA sequencing of Muller glia, progenitors and regenerated progeny from uninjured and light-lesioned retinae. We discover an injury-induced Muller glia differentiation trajectory that leads into a cell population with a hybrid identity expressing marker genes of Muller glia and progenitors. A glial self-renewal and a neurogenic trajectory depart from the hybrid cell population. We further observe that neurogenic progenitors progressively differentiate to generate retinal ganglion cells first and bipolar cells last, similar to the events observed during retinal development. Our work provides a comprehensive description of Muller glia and progenitor transcriptional changes and fate decisions in the regenerating retina, which are key to tailor cell differentiation and replacement therapies for retinal dystrophies in humans.",

    "abstract": "Variations in B cell numbers are associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) through unknown mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that B cells are not central mediators of PCOS pathology and that their frequencies are altered as a direct effect of androgen receptor activation. Hyperandrogenic women with PCOS have increased frequencies of age-associated double-negative B memory cells and increased levels of circulating immunoglobulin M (IgM). However, the transfer of serum IgG from women into wild-type female mice induces only an increase in body weight. Furthermore, RAG1 knock-out mice, which lack mature T- and B cells, fail to develop any PCOS-like phenotype. In wild-type mice, co-treatment with flutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, prevents not only the development of a PCOS-like phenotype but also alterations of B cell frequencies induced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Finally, B cell-deficient mice, when exposed to DHT, are not protected from developing a PCOS-like phenotype. These results urge further studies on B cell functions and their effects on autoimmune comorbidities highly prevalent among women with PCOS.\n\nSummaryAndrogen receptor activation alters B cell frequencies and functionality as the transfer of human PCOS IgG increase weight in female mice.

    "abstract": "Responses to potentially dangerous stimuli are among the most basic animal behaviors. While research has shown that threats automatically capture the attention of human participants, research has failed to demonstrate automatic behavioral responses to threats in humans. Using a naturalistic paradigm, we show that two species of animals humans often report fearing trigger rapid withdrawal responses: participants withdrew their arm from photos of snakes and spiders faster, and with higher acceleration when compared to bird and butterfly stimuli. The behavioral was specific to withdrawal as approach movements, or button-press/release tasks failed to detect a similar difference. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we show that the fast withdrawal was mediated by two attentional processes. First, fast withdrawal responses correlated with early amplification of sensory signals (P1, 70-110 ms after stimulus). Second, a later correlate of feature-based attention (early posterior negativity, EPN, 200-240 ms after stimulus) revealed the opposite pattern: Stronger EPN was associated with slower behavioral responses, suggesting that the deployment of attention towards threatening stimulus features was detrimental for withdrawal speed. Altogether, the results suggest that rapid behavioral withdrawal from threatening animals in humans is mediated by reflex-like attentional processing.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial growth often alters the environment, which in turn can impact interspecies interactions among bacteria. Here, we used an in vitro batch system containing mucin beads to emulate the dynamic host environment and to study its impact on the interactions between two abundant and prevalent human gut bacteria, the primary fermenter Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and the butyrate producer Roseburia intestinalis. By combining machine learning and flow cytometry, we found that the number of viable B. thetaiotaomicron cells decreases with glucose consumption due to acid production, while R. intestinalis survives post-glucose depletion by entering a slow growth mode. Both species attach to mucin beads, but only viable cell counts of B. thetaiotaomicron increase significantly. The number of viable co-culture cells varies significantly over time compared to those of monocultures. A combination of targeted metabolomics and RNA-seq showed that the slow growth mode of R. intestinalis represents a diauxic shift towards acetate and lactate consumption, whereas B. thetaiotaomicron survives glucose depletion and low pH by foraging on mucin sugars. In addition, most of the mucin monosaccharides we tested inhibited the growth of R. intestinalis but not B. thetaiotaomicron. We encoded these causal relationships in a kinetic model, which reproduced the observed dynamics. In summary, we explored how R. intestinalis and B. thetaiotaomicron respond to nutrient scarcity and how this affects their dynamics. We highlight the importance of understanding bacterial metabolic strategies to effectively modulate microbial dynamics in changing conditions.",

    "abstract": "Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) inside the cell often results in biological condensates that can critically impact cell homeostasis. Such phase separation events occur in multiple parts of cells, including the cell membranes, where the so-called \"lipid raft\" hypothesis posits the formation of ordered domains floating in a sea of disordered lipids. The resulting lipid domains often have functional roles. However, the thermodynamics of lipid phase separation and their resulting mechanistic effects on cell function and dysfunction are poorly understood. Understanding such complex phenomena in cell membranes, with their diverse lipid compositions, is exceptionally difficult. For this reasons, simple model systems that can recapitulate similar behavior are widely used to study this phenomenon. Despite these simplifications, the timescale and and length scales of domain formation pose a challenge for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Thus, most MD studies focus on spontaneous lipid phase separation -- essentially measuring the sign (but not the amplitude) of the free energy change upon separation -- rather than directly interrogating the thermodynamics. Here, we propose a proof-of-concept pipeline that can directly measure this free energy by combining coarse-grained MD with enhanced sampling protocols using a novel collective variable. This approach will be a useful tool to help connect the thermodynamics of phase separation with the mechanistic insights already available from molecular dynamics simulations.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEStandard molecular dynamics simulations can determine the sign the free energy change upon phase separation, but not the amplitude. We present a new method to determine the phase separation free energy for lipid membranes, based on a enhanced sampling using the weighted ensemble method combined with a novel collective variable, validated using coarse-grained simulations applied to several simple systems. The new method will be valuable as a way to develop models that connect molecular-level structural features to the thermodynamics of phase separation.",

    "abstract": "All lipid membranes have inherent morphological preferences and resist deformation. Yet adaptations in membrane shape can and do occur at multiple length scales. While this plasticity is crucial for cellular physiology, the factors controlling the morphological energetics of lipid bilayers and the dominant mechanisms of membrane remodeling remain unclear. An ongoing debate regarding the universality of the stiffening effect of cholesterol underscores the challenges facing this field, both experimentally and theoretically, even for simple lipid mixtures. On the computational side, we have argued that enhanced- sampling all-atom molecular dynamics simulations are uniquely suited for quantification of membrane conformational energetics, not only because they minimize a-priori assumptions, but also because they permit analysis of bilayers in deformed states. To showcase this approach, we examine reported inconsistencies between alternative experimental measurements of bending moduli for cholesterol-enriched membranes. Specifically, we analyze lipid bilayers with different chain saturation, and compute free-energy landscapes for curvature deformations distributed over areas from [~]5 to [~]60 nm2. These enhanced simulations, totaling over 100 microseconds of sampling time, enable us to directly quantify both bending and tilt moduli, and to dissect the contributing factors and molecular mechanisms of curvature generation at each length scale. Our results show that cholesterol effects are lipid-specific, in agreement with giantvesicle measurements, and explain why experiments probing nanometer scale lipid dynamics diverge. In summary, we demonstrate that quantitative structure-mechanics relationships can now be established for heterogenous membranes, paving the way for addressing open fundamental questions in cell membrane mechanics.\n\nSignificanceElucidating the energetics and mechanisms of membrane remodeling is an essential step towards understanding cell physiology. This problem is challenging, however, because membrane bending involves both large-scale and atomic-level dynamics, which are difficult to measure simultaneously. A recent controversy regarding the stiffening effect of cholesterol, which is ubiquitous in animal cells, illustrates this challenge. We show how enhanced molecular-dynamics simulations can bridge this length-scale gap and reconcile seemingly incongruent observations. This approach facilitates a conceptual connection between lipid chemistry and membrane mechanics, thereby providing a solid basis for future research on remodeling phenomena, such as in membrane trafficking or viral infection.",

    "abstract": "Marine algae are responsible for half of the worlds primary productivity, but this critical carbon sink is often constrained by insufficient iron. One species of marine algae, Dunaliella tertiolecta, is remarkable for its ability to maintain photosynthesis and thrive in low-iron environments. A related species, Dunaliella salina Bardawil, shares this attribute but is an extremophile found in hyper-saline environments. To elucidate how algae manage their iron requirements, we produced high-quality genome assemblies and transcriptomes for both species to serve as a foundation for a comparative multi-omics analysis. We identified a host of iron-uptake proteins in both species, including a massive expansion of transferrins and a novel family of siderophore-iron uptake proteins. Complementing these multiple iron-uptake routes, ferredoxin functions as a large iron reservoir that can be released by induction of flavodoxin. Proteomic analysis revealed reduced investment in the photosynthetic apparatus coupled with remodeling of antenna proteins by dramatic iron-deficiency induction of TIDI1, an LHCA-related protein found also in other chlorophytes. These combinatorial iron scavenging and sparing strategies make Dunaliella unique among photosynthetic organisms.\n\nSignificance StatementDespite their small size, microalgae play a huge role in CO2 uptake via photosynthesis, and represent an important target for climate crisis mitigation efforts. Most photosynthesis proteins require iron as a co-factor so that insufficient iron often limits algal CO2 sequestration. With this in mind, we examined a genus of microalgae called Dunaliella that is exceptionally well-adapted to low iron environments. We produced complete genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes for two species of Dunaliella that hail from radically different environments: one from coastal ocean waters and the other from salt flats. We identified dozens of genes and multiple, complementary strategies that both species utilize for iron-uptake and management that explain Dunaliellas remarkable ability to thrive on low iron.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of phylogenetic trees has become an essential tool in epidemiology. Likelihood-based methods fit models to phylogenies to draw inferences about the phylodynamics and history of viral transmission. However, these methods are computationally expensive, which limits the complexity and realism of phylodynamic models and makes them ill-suited for informing policy decisions in real-time during rapidly developing outbreaks. Likelihood-free methods using deep learning are pushing the boundaries of inference beyond these constraints. In this paper, we extend, compare and contrast a recently developed deep learning method for likelihood-free inference from trees. We trained multiple deep neural networks using phylogenies from simulated outbreaks that spread among five locations and found they achieve close to the same levels of accuracy as Bayesian inference under the true simulation model. We compared robustness to model misspecification of a trained neural network to that of a Bayesian method. We found that both models had comparable performance, converging on similar biases. We also implemented a method of uncertainty quantification called conformalized quantile regression which we demonstrate has similar patterns of sensitivity to model misspecification as Bayesian highest posterior intervals (HPI) and greatly overlap with HPIs, but have lower precision (more conservative). Finally, we trained and tested a neural network against phylogeographic data from a recent study of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic in Europe and obtained similar estimates of region-specific epidemiological parameters and the location of the common ancestor in Europe. Along with being as accurate and robust as likelihood-based methods, our trained neural networks are on average over 3 orders of magnitude faster. Our results support the notion that neural networks can be trained with simulated data to accurately mimic the good and bad statistical properties of the likelihood functions of generative phylogenetic models.",

    "abstract": "Brazil has a very large biological variety, which is an almost inexhaustible source of substances of pharmacological and biotechnological interest. Several studies have demonstrated the presence of bioactive peptides in insect hemolymph and their potential use as therapeutic agents. However, few data are available regarding molecules extracted from insects with anti-apoptotic action. The objective of this work was to identify and isolate proteins from the hemolymph of caterpillars of the Megalopygidae family with pharmacological and biotechnological interest. Two species of this family were studied, Podalia sp and Megalopyge albicolis. Cytotoxicity tests on Vero and Sf-9 cells revealed that the hemolymph of both caterpillars was cytotoxic only at concentrations greater than 5%v/v. In the anti-apoptotic activity assays, it was verified that the supplementation of cell cultures with only 1% of hemolymph v/v is sufficient to inhibit cell death by apoptosis induced by different inducers such as terbutyl, actinomycin D, hydrogen peroxide, or even by nutrient depletion. For this study, cells were stained with trypan blue, crystal violet, and fluorescent markers to cytoskeleton (actin and tubulin), mitochondria membrane electric potential (JC-1), and apoptosis marker (acridine orange and ethidium). The protein responsible for anti-apoptotic action was isolated through gel filtration chromatography, using an AKTA purifier high-resolution liquid chromatography system. The hemolymph was fractionated into 3 pools for Podalia sp and 6 pools for M. abicolis. In the antiapoptotic tests, semi-purified hemolymph from both caterpillars showed anti-apoptotic effect in VERO and SF-9 cells, pre-treated with only 1% v/v of hemolymph and induced to death by different and apoptotic inductors. Was observed that the molecule with anti-apoptotic effect is present in pool 3 in both hemolymphs. This protector effect blocked and attenuated the disruption of the cytoskeleton (actin filaments), being that the protective effect also was observed on the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane of SF-9 cells pre-treated with both hemolymphs and treated with the apoptosis inducer Terbutil at concentrations of 25 to 100M. By acting on the mitochondrial pathway of death by apoptosis, a pathway that can cause disorders and diseases neurodegenerative such as Parkinsons and Alzheimers diseases, substances present in the hemolymph of these and others caterpillars could be good candidates in studies for the treatment of these diseases.",

    "abstract": "Combination drug therapies are effective treatments for cancer. However, the genetic heterogeneity of the patients and exponentially large space of drug pairings pose significant challenges for finding the right combination for a specific patient. Current in silico prediction methods can be instrumental in reducing the vast number of candidate drug combinations. However, existing powerful methods are trained with cancer cell line gene expression data, which limits their applicability in clinical settings. While synergy measurements on cell lines models are available at large scale, patient-derived samples are too few to train a complex model. On the other hand, patient-specific single-drug response data are relatively more available. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework, Personalized Deep Synergy Predictor (PDSP), that enables us to use the patient-specific single drug response data for customizing patient drug synergy predictions. PDSP is first trained to learn synergy scores of drug pairs and their single drug presonses for a given cell line using drug structures and large scale cell line gene expression data. Then, the model is fine-tuned for patients with their patient gene expression data and associated single drug response measured on the patient ex vivo samples. In this study, we evaluate PDSP on data from three leukemia patients and observe that it improves the prediction accuracy by 27% compared to models trained on cancer cell line data.

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of ischemic stroke, which is a leading cause of death and long-term disability. Understanding the exact cellular signaling pathways that initiate and propagate neuroinflammation after stroke will be critical for developing immunomodulatory stroke therapies. In particular, the precise mechanisms of inflammatory signaling in the clinically relevant hyperacute period, hours after stroke, have not been elucidated. We used the RiboTag technique to obtain astrocyte and microglia-derived mRNA transcripts in a hyperacute (4 hours) and acute (3 days) period after stroke, as these two cell types are key modulators of acute neuroinflammation. Microglia initiated a rapid response to stroke at 4 hours by adopting an inflammatory profile associated with the recruitment of immune cells. The hyperacute astrocyte profile was marked by stress response genes and transcription factors, such as Fos and Jun, involved in pro-inflammatory pathways such as TNF-. By 3 days, microglia shift to a proliferative state and astrocytes strengthen their inflammatory response. The astrocyte pro-inflammatory response at 3 days is partially driven by the upregulation of the transcription factors C/EBP{beta}, Spi1, and Rel, which comprise 25% of upregulated transcription factor-target interactions. Surprisingly, few sex differences across all groups were observed. Expression and log2 fold data for all sequenced genes are available on a user-friendly website for researchers to examine gene changes and generate hypotheses for stroke targets. Taken together our data comprehensively describe the astrocyte and microglia-specific translatome response in the hyperacute and acute period after stroke and identify pathways critical for initiating neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "The detection of novel stimuli is critical to learn and survive in a dynamic environment. Though novel stimuli powerfully affect brain activity, their impact on specific cell types and circuits is not well understood. Disinhibition is one candidate mechanism for novelty-induced enhancements in activity. Here we characterize the impact of stimulus novelty on disinhibitory circuit components using longitudinal 2-photon calcium imaging of Vip, Sst, and excitatory populations in the mouse visual cortex. Mice learn a behavioral task with stimuli that become highly familiar, then are tested on both familiar and novel stimuli. Mice consistently perform the task with novel stimuli, yet responses to stimulus presentations and stimulus omissions are dramatically altered. Further, we find that novelty modifies coding of visual as well as behavioral and task information. At the population level, the direction of these changes is consistent with engagement of the Vip-Sst disinhibitory circuit. At the single cell level, we identify separate clusters of Vip, Sst, and excitatory cells with unique patterns of novelty-induced coding changes. This study and the accompanying open-access dataset reveals the impact of novelty on sensory and behavioral representations in visual cortical circuits and establishes novelty as a key driver of cellular functional diversity.",

    "abstract": "Serotonin is critical for adapting behavior flexibly to meet changing environmental demands. Cognitive flexibility is important both for successful attainment of goals, as well as for social interactions, and is frequently impaired in neuropsychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, a unifying mechanistic framework accounting for the role of serotonin in behavioral flexibility has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate common effects of manipulating serotonin function across two species (rats and humans) on latent processes supporting choice behavior during probabilistic reversal learning using computational modelling. The findings support a role of serotonin in behavioral flexibility and plasticity, indicated, respectively, by increases or decreases in choice repetition ( stickiness) or reinforcement learning rates depending upon manipulations intended to increase or decrease serotonin function. More specifically, the rate at which expected value increased following reward and decreased following punishment (reward and punishment  learning rates) was greatest after sub-chronic administration of the selective serotonin reuptake (SSRI) citalopram (5 mg/kg for 7 days followed by 10 mg/kg twice a day for 5 days) in rats. Conversely, humans given a single dose of an SSRI (20mg escitalopram), which can decrease post-synaptic serotonin signalling, and rats that received the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), which destroys forebrain serotonergic neurons, exhibited decreased reward learning rates. A basic perseverative tendency ( stickiness), or choice repetition irrespective of the outcome produced, was likewise increased in rats after the 12-day SSRI regimen and decreased after single dose SSRI in humans and 5,7-DHT in rats. These common effects of serotonergic manipulations on rats and humans - identified via computational modelling - suggest an evolutionarily conserved role for serotonin in plasticity and behavioral flexibility and have clinical relevance transdiagnostically for neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how a T cell receptor (TCR) recognizes its specific ligand peptide is crucial for gaining insight into biological functions and disease mechanisms. Despite its importance, experimentally determining TCR-peptide interactions is expensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, computational methods have been proposed, but they are typically evaluated by internal retrospective validation only, and few have incorporated and tested an attention layer from language models into structural information.\n\nTherefore, in this study, we developed a machine learning model based on a modified version of the Transformer, a source-target-attention neural network, to predict TCR-peptide binding solely from the amino acid sequences of the TCRs complementarity-determining region (CDR) 3 and the peptide. This model achieved competitive performance on a benchmark dataset of TCR-peptide binding, as well as on a truly new external dataset. Additionally, by analyzing the results of binding predictions, we associated the neural network weights with protein structural properties. By classifying the residues into large and small attention groups, we identified statistically significant properties associated with the largely attended residues, such as hydrogen bonds within the CDR3. The dataset that we have created and our models ability to provide an interpretable prediction of TCR-peptide binding should increase our knowledge of molecular recognition and pave the way to designing new therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The effects of selection on an organisms genome are hard to detect on small spatial scales, as gene flow can erase signatures of local adaptation. Most genome scans to detect signatures of environmental selection are performed on large spatial scales, however divergent selection on the local scale (e.g. between contrasting soil conditions) has also been demonstrated, in particular for herbaceous plants. Here we hypothesize that in topographically complex landscapes, microenvironment variability is strong enough to leave a selective footprint in genomes of long-lived organisms. To test this, we investigated paired south- versus north-facing Pinus pinaster stands in a Mediterranean mountain area. While north-facing (mesic) stands experience less radiation, south facing (xeric) stands represent especially harsh conditions, particularly during the dry summer season. Outlier detection revealed five putatively adaptive loci out of 4,034, two of which encoded non-synonymous substitutions. Additionally, one locus showed consistent allele frequency differences in all three stand pairs indicating divergent selection despite high gene flow on the local scale. Functional annotation of these candidate genes revealed biological functions related to abiotic stress response in other species. Our study highlights how divergent selection shapes the functional genetic variation within populations of long-lived forest trees on local spatial scales.",

Observational and preclinical data have suggested it to be capable of producing both subjective and emotional effects on par with other classical psychedelics and entactogens. Whereas it is the most prevalently used novel serotonergic hallucinogen to date, its acute effects and distinctions from classical progenitors have yet to be characterised in a controlled study. We assessed for the first time the immediate acute subjective, cognitive, and cardiovascular effects of 2C-B (20 mg) in comparison to psilocybin (15mg) and placebo in a within-subjects, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 22 healthy psychedelic-experienced participants. 2C-B elicited alterations of waking consciousness of a psychedelic nature, with dysphoria, subjective impairment, auditory alterations, and affective elements of ego dissolution largest under psilocybin. Participants demonstrated equivalent psychomotor slowing and spatial memory impairments under either compound compared to placebo, as indexed by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Tower of London (TOL) and Spatial Memory Task (SMT). Neither compound produced empathogenic effects on the Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET). 2C-B induced transient pressor effects to a similar degree as psilocybin. The duration of self-reported effects of 2C-B was shorter than that of psilocybin, largely resolving within 6 hours. Present findings support the categorisation of 2C-B as a subjectively \"lighter\" psychedelic. Tailored dose-effect studies are needed to discern the pharmacokinetic dependency of 2C-Bs experiential overlaps.",

    "abstract": "SummaryNeuronal circuits evolve as a precisely patterned network. In this context, a growing neuron must locate the appropriate target area on a neurite of a neighbouring cell with which to connect. Controlled target selection involves dendritic filopodial contacts and requires the exact apposition of synaptic components. Calcium signalling has been postulated to trigger the transformation from dendritic filopodia into functional synapses. However, calcium is a rather unspecific signalling system, and it needs to be clarified how the exact development of synaptic connections is controlled. Similarly, Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling promotes synapse formation; however, how secreted Wnts induce and maintain synapses on neuronal dendrites is not well understood. Here, we show that Wnt-7a is tethered to the tips of dynamic dendritic filopodia during spine formation in human cortical neurons. These filopodia can activate Wnt signalling precisely at the contact sites on the dendrites of an adjacent neuron. Subsequently, local calcium transients can be observed at these Wnt-positive contact sites. Depleting either the filopodial-loaded Wnt or the extracellular calcium pool blocks the clustering of pre- and post-synaptic markers, hence the establishment of stable connections. Therefore, we postulate that local Wnt-7a signalling from the tip of the dendritic filopodia, verified by simultaneous calcium signalling, provides an elegant mechanism for orchestrating focal synapse maturation.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-intrinsic error-correction mechanisms allow epithelial cells to detect aberrant neighboring cells and cause their removal from the tissue. The molecular mechanisms which grant cells the ability to compare their internal states is unknown. Here we demonstrate that comparison of cell identity, created by cell-fate-specifying transcription factors and patterning pathways, is conveyed through a specific set of cell surface molecules. We demonstrate that Drosophila imaginal discs express a range of cell surface molecules previously implicated in neuronal axon guidance processes, such as members of the Robo, Teneurin, Ephrin, Toll-like or atypical Cadherin families. Expression of these molecules is regulated by intrinsic fate-patterning pathways of the disc but also by aberrant expression of oncogenic RasV12. Importantly, mosaic clones deregulating individual cell surface molecules are sufficient to induce all hallmarks of interface surveillance, a tissue-intrinsic error-correction mechanism previously shown to be induced by cells with aberrant activation of fate-patterning pathways. Specifically, cells with deregulated expression of Robo2 and Robo3 induce actomyosin enrichment, bilateral JNK signaling and apoptosis at mosaic clone interfaces in imaginal discs. Moreover, deregulation of Robo2 levels, which is normally expressed in a complex endogenous pattern, induces these interface surveillance hallmarks in a Robo2-pattern-specific manner. Taken together, our work indicates that these cell surface molecules mediate cell fate recognition in epithelial tissues and thereby contribute to the maintenance of epithelial health by initiating detection and removal of aberrant cells during development and adult tissue homeostasis.",

By activating the STAT3 pathway using LIF, which is not produced in guided cortical organoids, we developed a cerebral organoid differentiation method from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that recapitulates the expansion of a progenitor pool into the oSVZ. The structured oSVZ is composed of progenitor cells expressing specific oRG markers such as GFAP, LIFR, HOPX, which closely matches human oRG in vivo. In this microenvironment, cortical neurons showed faster maturation with enhanced metabolic and functional activity. Incorporation of hPSC-derived brain vascular LIF- producing pericytes in cerebral organoids mimicked the effects of LIF treatment.

However, selecting an appropriate computational tool to differentiate functionally relevant genetic variants from those with no effect is challenging, particularly for deep intronic regions where independent benchmarks are scarce.\n\nIn this study, we have provided an overview of the computational methods available and the extent to which they can be used to analyze deep intronic variation. We leveraged diverse datasets to extensively evaluate tool performance across different intronic regions, distinguishing between variants that are expected to disrupt splicing through different molecular mechanisms. Notably, we compared the performance of SpliceAI, a widely used sequence-based deep learning model, with that of more recent methods that extend its original implementation. We observed considerable differences in tool performance depending on the region considered, with variants generating cryptic splice sites being better predicted than those that affect splicing regulatory elements or the branchpoint region. Finally, we devised a novel quantitative assessment of tool interpretability and found that tools providing mechanistic explanations of their predictions are often correct with respect to the ground truth information, but the use of these tools results in decreased predictive power when compared to black box methods.\n\nOur findings translate into practical recommendations for tool usage and provide a reference framework for applying prediction tools in deep intronic regions, enabling more informed decision-making by practitioners.",

However, the common molecular and cellular nature of the stress responsome across different stimuli is not described. In this study, we compared the expression behaviors between burns and COVID-19 infection by choosing the transcriptome of peripheral blood from related patients as the analytic target since the blood cells reflect the systemic landscape of immune homeostasis. We identified an immune co-stimulator (CD86)-centered network, named stress-response core (SRC), which coordinated multiple immune processes and was robust in membership and highly related to the clinical traits in both burns and COVID-19. An independent whole blood single-cell RNA sequencing of COVID-19 patients demonstrated that the monocyte-dendritic cell (Mono-DC) wing was the major cellular source of the SRC, among which the higher expression of the SRC in the monocyte was associated with the asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, while the quantity-restricted and function-defected CD1C-CD141-DCs were recognized as the key signature which linked to bad consequences in COVID-19. Specifically, the proportion of the CD1C-CD141-DCs and their SRC expression levels were step-wise reduced along with worse clinic conditions while the sub-cluster of CD1C-CD141-DCs of the critical COVID-19 patients was characterized of IFN signaling quiescence, high mitochondrial metabolism and immune-communication inactivation. Thus, our study identified an expression-synchronized and function-focused gene network which was decreased under burns and COVID-19 stress and argued the CD1C-CD141-DC as the prognosis-related cell population which might serve as a new target of diagnosis and therapy.",

In this study, we examined the efficiency of viral isolation including SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains between nasal/nasopharyngeal swab or saliva specimens. Furthermore, we also examined the comparison of viral isolation rates by sample species using simulated specimens for COVID- 19. As a result, it was found that the isolation efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva specimens was significantly lower than that in the nasal/nasopharyngeal swab specimens. In order to determine which component of saliva is responsible for the lower isolation rate of saliva specimens, we tested the abilities of lactoferrin, amylase, cathelicidin, and mucin, which are considered to be abundant in saliva, to inhibit the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped viruses (SARS-CoV-2pv). Lactoferrin and amylase were found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2pv infection. In conclusion, even if the same number of viral genome copies was detected by the real-time RT-PCR test, infection of SARS-CoV-2 present in saliva is thought to be inhibited by inhibitory factors such as lactoferrin and amylase, compared to nasal/nasopharyngeal swab specimens.",

    "abstract": "The development of a technology capable of sequencing single proteins holds promise to unravel new biological information hidden in ensemble analysis. However, new techniques must be first developed. In one approach, proteins are unfolded and translocate across a nanopore under an external bias. Unlike DNA, however, proteins do not have a uniform charge, and the electrophoretic force cannot be used to translocate proteins. Here, we show that by introducing sets of charges spaced by ~1 nm an otherwise neutral nanopore an electroosmotic force is created that induces the unidirectional transport of polypeptides, even against relatively strong electrophoretic forces. Unstructured polypeptides and native proteins unfolded with urea produce current signatures as they traversed the nanopore, which could lead to quick protein identifcation. This approach can be used to translocate and stretch proteins in non-enzymatic protein identification and enzymatic protein sequencing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Heterochromatin has been thought to be assembled by phase separation of chromatin. However, a fission yeast has only three chromosomes and the heterochromatin of this organism is not likely to be assembled by phase separation, which is a collective phenomenon of many chains. Motivated by our recent experiments that demonstrate that the tandemly repeated genes become heterochromatin, we constructed a theory of heterochromatin assembly by taking into account the connectivity of these genes along the chromatin in the kinetic equations of small RNA production and histone methylation, which are the key biochemical reactions involved in the heterochromatin assembly. Our theory predicts that the polymeric nature of the tandemly repeated genes ensures the steady production of small RNAs because of the stable binding of nascent RNAs produced from the genes to RDRC/Dicers at the surface of nuclear membrane. This theory also predicts that the compaction of the tandemly repeated genes suppresses the production of small RNAs, consistent with our recent experiments. This theory can be extended to the small RNA-dependent gene silencing in higher organisms.",

    "abstract": "The flagellated kinetoplastid protozoan and causative agent of human Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi, inhabits both invertebrate and mammalian hosts over the course of its complex life cycle. In these disparate environments, T. cruzi uses its single flagellum to propel motile life stages and in some instances, to establish intimate contact with the host. Beyond its role in motility, the functional capabilities of the T. cruzi flagellum have not been defined. Moreover, the lack of proteomic information for this organelle, in any parasite life stage, has limited functional investigation. In this study, we employed a proximity-dependent biotinylation approach based on the differential targeting of the biotin ligase, TurboID, to the flagellum or cytosol in replicative stages of T. cruzi, to identify flagellar-enriched proteins by mass spectrometry. Proteomic analysis of the resulting biotinylated protein fractions yielded 218 candidate flagellar proteins in T. cruzi epimastigotes (insect stage) and 99 proteins in intracellular amastigotes (mammalian stage). Forty of these flagellar-enriched proteins were common to both parasite life stages and included orthologs of known flagellar proteins in other trypanosomatid species, proteins specific to the T. cruzi lineage and hypothetical proteins. With the validation of flagellar localization for several of the identified candidates, our results demonstrate that TurboID-based proximity proteomics is an effective tool for probing subcellular compartments in T. cruzi. The proteomic datasets generated in this work offer a valuable resource to facilitate functional investigation of the understudied T. cruzi flagellum.\n\nImportanceTrypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite that causes Chagas disease, which contributes substantial morbidity and mortality in South and Central America. Throughout its life cycle, T. cruzi interacts with insect and mammalian hosts via its single flagellum, establishing intimate contact with host membranes. Currently, few flagellar proteins have been identified in T. cruzi that could provide insight into the mechanisms involved in mediating physical and biochemical interactions with the host. Here, we set out to identify flagellar proteins in the main replicative stages of T. cruzi using a proximity-labeling approach coupled with mass spectrometry. The >200 candidate flagellar proteins identified represent the first large scale identification of candidate flagellar proteins in T. cruzi with preliminary validation. These data offer new avenues to investigate the biology of T. cruzi - host interactions, a promising area for development of new strategies aimed at the control of this pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsChronic infection with hepatitis B and hepatitis delta viruses (HDV) is considered the most serious form of viral hepatitis due to more severe manifestations of and accelerated progression to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is no FDA-approved treatment for HDV and current interferon-alpha treatment is suboptimal. We characterized early HDV kinetics post inoculation and incorporated mathematical modeling to provide insights into host-HDV dynamics.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed HDV RNA serum viremia in 192 immunocompetent (C57BL/6) and immunodeficient (NRG) mice that did or did not transgenically express the HDV receptor - human sodium taurocholate co-transporting peptide (hNTCP).\n\nResultsKinetic analysis indicates an unanticipated biphasic decline consisting of a sharp first-phase and slower second-phase decline regardless of immunocompetence. HDV decline after re-inoculation again followed a biphasic decline; however, a steeper second-phase HDV decline was observed in NRG-hNTCP mice compared to NRG mice. HDV-entry inhibitor bulevirtide administration and HDV re-inoculation indicated that viral entry and receptor saturation are not major contributors to clearance, respectively. The biphasic kinetics can be mathematically modeled by assuming the existence of a non-specific binding compartment with a constant on/off-rate and the steeper second-phase decline by a loss of bound virus that cannot be returned as free virus to circulation. The model predicts that free HDV is cleared with a half-life of 18 minutes (standard error, SE: 2.4), binds to non-specific cells with a rate of 0.06 hour-1 (SE: 0.03), and returns as free virus with a rate of 0.23 hour-1 (SE: 0.03).\n\nConclusionsUnderstanding early HDV-host kinetics will inform pre-clinical therapeutic kinetic studies on how the efficacy of anti-HDV therapeutics can be affected by early kinetics of viral decline.\n\nLAY SUMMARYThe persistence phase of HDV infection has been studied in some animal models, however, the early kinetics of HDV in vivo is incompletely understood. In this study, we characterize an unexpectedly HDV biphasic decline post inoculation in immunocompetent and immunodeficient mouse models and use mathematical modeling to provide insights into HDV-host dynamics. Understanding the kinetics of viral clearance in the blood can aid pre-clinical development and testing models for anti-HDV therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The fungal pathogen Candida auris represents a severe threat to hospitalized patients. Its resistance to multiple classes of antifungal drugs and ability to spread and resist decontamination in health-care settings make it especially dangerous. We screened 1,990 clinically approved and late-stage investigational compounds for the potential to be repurposed as antifungal drugs targeting C. auris and narrowed our focus to five FDA-approved compounds with inhibitory concentrations under 10 {micro}M for C. auris and significantly lower toxicity to three human cell lines. These compounds, some of which had been previously identified in independent screens, include three dihalogenated 8-hydroxyquinolines: broxyquinoline, chloroxine, and clioquinol. A subsequent structure-activity study of 32 quinoline derivatives found that 8-hydroxyquinolines, especially those dihalogenated at the C5 and C7 positions, were the most effective inhibitors of C. auris. To pursue these compounds further, we exposed C. auris to clioquinol in an extended experimental evolution study and found that C. auris developed only 2- to 5-fold resistance to the compound. DNA sequencing of resistant strains and subsequent verification by directed mutation in naive strains revealed that resistance was due to mutations in the transcriptional regulator CAP1 (causing upregulation of the drug transporter MDR1) and in the drug transporter CDR1. These mutations had only modest effects on resistance to traditional antifungal agents, and the CDR1 mutation rendered C. auris more sensitive to posaconazole. This observation raises the possibility that a combination treatment involving an 8-hydroxyquinoline and posaconazole might prevent C. auris from developing resistance to this established antifungal agent.\n\nAbstract ImportanceThe rapidly emerging fungal pathogen Candida auris represents a growing threat to hospitalized patients, in part due to frequent resistance to multiple classes of antifungal drugs. We identify a class of compounds, the dihalogenated hydroxyquinolines, with broad fungistatic ability against a diverse collection of 13 strains of C. auris. Although this compound has been identified in previous screens, we extended the analysis by showing that C. auris developed only modest 2- to 5-fold increases in resistance to this class of compounds despite long-term exposure; a noticeable difference from the 30- to 500- fold increases in resistance reported for similar studies with commonly used antifungal drugs. We also identify the mutations underlying the resistance. These results suggest that the dihalogenated hydroxyquinolines are working inside the fungal cell and should be developed further to combat C. auris and other fungal pathogens.\n\nTweetLohse and colleagues characterize a class of compounds that inhibit the fungal pathogen C. auris. Unlike many other antifungal drugs, C. auris does not readily develop resistance to this class of compounds.",

    "abstract": "The Type VIIb protein secretion system (T7SSb) is found in Bacillota (firmicute) bacteria and has been shown to mediate interbacterial competition. EssC is a membrane-bound ATPase that is a critical component of the T7SSb and plays a key role in substrate recognition. Prior analysis of available genome sequences of the foodborne bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes has shown that although the T7SSb was encoded as part of the core genome, EssC could be found as one of seven different sequence variants. While each sequence variant was associated with a specific suite of candidate substrate proteins encoded immediately downstream of essC, many LXG-domain proteins were encoded across multiple essC sequence variants. Here we have extended this analysis using a diverse collection of 37,930 L. monocytogenes genomes. We have identified a rare eighth variant of EssC present in ten L. monocytogenes Lineage III genomes. These genomes also encode a large toxin of the rearrangement hotspot (Rhs) repeat family adjacent to essC8, along with a probable immunity protein and three small accessory proteins. We have further identified nine novel LXG-domain proteins, and four additional chromosomal hotspots across L. monocytogenes genomes where LXG proteins can be encoded. The eight L. monocytogenes EssC variants were also found in other Listeria species, with additional novel EssC types also identified. Across the genus, species frequently encoded multiple EssC types, indicating that T7SSb diversity is a primary feature of the genus Listeria.\n\nDATA SUMMARYAll genome sequences used in this study are available via Genbank, and the assembly accession numbers are provided in Table S1. This file also lists relevant metadata (name, source category, country, year and clonal complex).\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTListeria monocytogenes is a soil-borne saprophytic bacterium and a food-borne pathogen of humans. Decomposing plant matter and the human GI tract are rich in diverse microbial species and to colonise these niches L. monocytogenes must be able to compete with other bacteria. The type VII secretion system (T7SS) of Bacillota has been shown to secrete protein toxins that target other bacteria. In this study we have analysed a diverse collection of L. monocytogenes genome sequences to study the diversity of the Listeria T7SS and its putative effector proteins. We show that the EssC component of the L. monocytogenes T7SS is highly diverse, clustering into one of eight sequence variants. Each EssC variant is associated with a specific toxin candidate, and the EssC8 variant T7SS likely secretes a novel rearrangement hotspot (Rhs) repeat toxin. We also identify multiple new LXG-families of T7SS toxins and describe genomic hotspots where they are encoded. We find no link between EssC variants and clinical outcome. In agreement with this, analysis of EssC variability in available genomes of other Listeria species showed that all eight L. monocytogenes EssC variants are present in non-monocytogenes Listeria species.",

    "abstract": "Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) is a shrimp pathogen that causes huge economic losses. In the present study, the hosts of EHP were investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in an aquaculture farm located in Maoming, China. EHP was detected in Litopenaeus vannamei, Penaeus monodon, crab, false mussel, and three dragonfly species (Anax parthenope, Pantala flavescens, and Ischnura senegalensis). In the histopathological examination using hematoxylin-eosin staining, EHP spores were found in nymphs and adult dragonflies naturally infected with EHP that were collected from the shrimp farm. Fluorescence in situ hybridization results showed a positive signal for EHP infection in the fat body of dragonfly nymphs. Immature and mature microsporidian spores and late sporogonial plasmodium were observed in the cytoplasm of dragonfly nymphs using transmission electron microscopy. The transmission of EHP from shrimp to dragonfly nymphs was confirmed via cohabitation challenge experiments in which EHP-free dragonfly nymphs were cohabited with EHP-infected shrimp, and the transmission of EHP from dragonfly nymphs to shrimp was demonstrated via the cohabitation of EHP-infected dragonfly nymphs with EHP-free shrimp and oral administration challenge experiments. This study confirms that dragonflies can act as natural EHP hosts, and a novel EHP horizontal transmission route exists between dragonflies and shrimp.\n\nAuthor summaryTo the authors knowledge, this study presents the first report of microsporidia (EHP) infecting both crustaceans and insects (A. parthenope, P. flavescens, and I. senegalensis). The horizontal transmission of EHP between dragonfly nymphs and shrimp was confirmed through cohabitation and oral administration challenge experiments. EHP has become a globally significant threat to shrimp aquaculture. The findings of the present study will help to design prevention strategies, such as the use of nets to prevent dragonflies from entering shrimp ponds.",

    "abstract": "Non-coding RNAs (sRNA) play a key role in controlling gene expression in bacteria, typically by base-pairing with ribosome binding sites to block translation. The modification of ribosome traffic along the mRNA generally affects its stability. However, a few cases have been described in bacteria where sRNAs can affect translation without a major impact on mRNA stability. To identify new sRNA targets in B. subtilis potentially belonging to this class of mRNAs, we used pulsed-SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture) to label newly synthesized proteins after short expression of the RoxS sRNA, the best characterized sRNA in this bacterium. RoxS sRNA was previously shown to interfere with the expression of genes involved in central metabolism, permitting control of the NAD+/NADH ratio in B. subtilis. In this study, we confirmed most of the known targets of RoxS, showing the efficiency of the method. We further expanded the number of mRNA targets encoding enzymes of the TCA cycle and identified new targets primarily regulated at the translational level. One of these is YcsA, a tartrate dehydrogenase that uses NAD+ as co-factor, in excellent agreement with the proposed role of RoxS in Firmicutes.\n\nImportanceNon-coding RNA (sRNA) play an important role in bacterial adaptation and virulence. The identification of the most complete set of targets for these regulatory RNAs is key to fully identify the perimeter of its function(s). Most sRNAs modify both the translation (directly) and mRNA stability (indirectly) of their targets. However, sRNAs can also influence the translation efficiency of the target primarily, with little or no impact on mRNA stability. The characterization of these targets is challenging. We describe here the application of the pulsed SILAC method to identify these targets and obtain the most complete list of targets for a defined sRNA.",

    "abstract": "Viruses interact with receptors on the cell surface to initiate and co-ordinate infection. The distribution of receptors on host cells can be a key determinant of viral tropism and host infection. Unravelling the complex nature of virus-receptor interactions is, therefore, of fundamental importance to understanding viral pathogenesis. Noroviruses are non-enveloped, icosahedral, positive-sense RNA viruses of global importance to human health, with no approved vaccine or antiviral agent available. Here we use murine norovirus as a model for the study of molecular mechanisms of virus-receptor interactions. We show that variation at a single amino acid residue in the major viral capsid protein had a key impact on the interaction between virus and receptor. This variation did not affect virion production or virus growth kinetics, but a specific amino acid was rapidly selected through evolution experiments, and significantly improved cellular attachment when infecting immune cells in suspension. However, reducing plasma membrane mobility counteracted this phenotype, providing insight into for the role of membrane fluidity and receptor recruitment in norovirus cellular attachment. When the infectivity of a panel of recombinant viruses with single amino acid variations was compared in vivo, there were significant differences in the distribution of viruses in a murine model, demonstrating a role in cellular tropism in vivo. Overall, these results highlight the importance of lipid rafts and virus-induced receptor recruitment in viral infection, as well as how capsid evolution can greatly influence cellular tropism, within-host spread and pathogenicity.\n\nImportanceAll viruses initiate infection by utilising receptors to attach to target host cells. These virus-receptor interactions can therefore dictate viral replication and pathogenesis. Understanding the nature of virus-receptor interactions could also be important to developing novel therapies. Noroviruses are non-enveloped icosahedral viruses of medical importance. They are a common cause of acute gastroenteritis with no approved vaccine or therapy and are a tractable model for studying fundamental virus biology. In this study, we utilise the murine norovirus model system to show that variation in a single amino acid of the major capsid protein can alone can affect viral infectivity through improved attachment to suspension cells. Reducing plasma membrane mobility reduced infectivity, providing an insight into the importance of membrane mobility for receptor recruitment. Furthermore, variation at this site was able to change viral distribution in a murine model, illustrating how in-host capsid evolution can influence viral infectivity and immune evasion.",

    "abstract": "The positive coactivator 4 or PC4 is a chromatin-associated protein whose role in gene regulation by wild-type p53 is now well-known. During tumorigenesis, p53 is often mutated resulting in its loss of function. A sub-class of these mutants gain new pro-proliferation properties which occur largely due to the upregulation of many pro-proliferation genes. Little is known about the roles of PC4 in tumor cells bearing mutant p53 genes. In this article, we show that PC4 associates with one of the tumor-associated gain-of-function p53 mutants, R273H. This association drives its recruitment to two promoters, UBE2C, and MDR1, known to be responsible for imparting aggressive growth and resistance to many drugs. A previously reported peptide that disrupts PC4-wild-type p53 interaction also disrupts the PC4-R273Hp53 protein-protein interaction. The introduction of this peptide to tumor cells bearing the R273HTP53 gene resulted in a lowering of MDR1 expression and abrogation of drug resistance. Interestingly, cells bearing another gain-of-function mutant R248W do not show the same type of response, suggesting that the action of PC4 on mutant p53s may differ for different GOF mutants. The results presented here suggest that PC4-R273H interaction may be a promising target for reducing proliferation and tumor drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "During postnatal development the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A deposits high levels of non-CG cytosine methylation in neurons. This unique methylation is critical for transcriptional regulation in the mature mammalian brain, and loss of this mark is implicated in DNMT3A-associated neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). The mechanisms determining genomic non-CG methylation profiles are not well defined however, and it is unknown if this pathway is disrupted in additional NDDs. Here we show that genome topology and gene expression converge to shape histone H3 lysine 36 dimethylation (H3K36me2) profiles, which in turn recruit DNMT3A and pattern neuronal non-CG methylation. We show that NSD1, the H3K36 methyltransferase mutated in the NDD, Sotos syndrome, is required for megabase-scale patterning of H3K36me2 and non-CG methylation in neurons. We find that brain-specific deletion of NSD1 causes alterations in DNA methylation that overlap with models of DNMT3A disorders and define convergent disruption in the expression of key neuronal genes in these models that may contribute to shared phenotypes in NSD1- and DNMT3A-associated NDD. Our findings indicate that H3K36me2 deposited by NSD1 is an important determinant of neuronal non-CG DNA methylation and implicates disruption of this methylation in Sotos syndrome.\n\nHighlightsO_LITopology-associated DNA methylation and gene expression independently contribute to neuronal gene body and enhancer non-CG DNA methylation patterns.\nC_LIO_LITopology-associated H3K36me2 patterns and local enrichment of H3K4 methylation impact deposition of non-CG methylation by DNMT3A.\nC_LIO_LIDisruption of NSD1 in vivo leads to alterations in H3K36me2, DNA methylation, and gene expression that overlap with models of DNMT3A disorders.\nC_LI",

Through its RNA endonuclease activity, Integrator is required for 3'-end processing of both non-coding and coding transcripts. Here we demonstrate that depleting Integrator subunit 11 (INTS11), the main catalytic subunit of the Integrator complex, leads to a global elongation defect as a result of decreased polymerase processivity. We observe this defect in the region approximately 12 to 35 kb downstream of the transcription start site (TSS), where RNAPII normally transitions to its maximum processivity. We also identify an important role for INTS11, possibly in association with RNAPII CTD phospho-Tyr1, in repressing antisense transcription upstream of active promoters, as well as repressing transcription of genic regions near AsiSI-induced double-strand breaks.\n\nAltogether, this study points toward a novel function of Integrator in promoting termination of incompetent RNAPII molecules while facilitating the transition to fully processive polymerase in order to enable efficient elongation.",

    "abstract": "The stability and activity of CRAF kinase are stringently regulated by heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Hsp90-mediated client folding and maturation is governed by its co-chaperones, but their functionality in chaperoning CRAF/Raf1 kinase to accomplish signaling under physiological conditions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Hsp70/Hsp90 organizing protein (HOP) associates with CRAF kinase for maintaining its kinase activity and facilitates the activation of the MAPK pathway. Such activation is mediated by TPR2A-2B-DP2 domain of HOP and requires efficient binding to Hsp90. Being a recruiter of Hsp90, Cdc37 is unable to supplement the function of HOP/Sti1. Downregulation of HOP/Sti1 in yeast and in vitro cell culture significantly reduces the CRAF signaling. Our data suggest that Hsp90 is recruited to CRAF in two steps, separately initiated by co-chaperones HOP and Cdc37 respectively during CRAF folding/maturation, and again upon CRAF activation mediated by HOP during MAPK signaling. Therefore, HOP is a regulator of CRAF kinase during activation of MAPK pathway and serves as a sensor of growth signaling beyond its client folding and maturation function.",

Here, we identify a novel cleaved form METTL3a (residues 239-580 of METTL3). We find that METTL3a is required for the METTL3-WTAP interaction, RNA m6A deposition, as well as cancer cell proliferation. Mechanistically, we find that METTL3a is essential for the METTL3-METTL3 interaction, which is a prerequisite step for recruitment of WTAP in MTC. Analysis of m6A sequencing data shows that depletion of METTL3a globally disrupts m6A deposition, and METTL3a mediates mTOR activation via m6A-mediated suppression of TMEM127 expression. Moreover, we find that METTL3 cleavage is mediated by proteasome in an mTOR-dependent manner, revealing positive regulatory feedback between METTL3a and mTOR signaling. Our findings reveal METTL3a as an important component of MTC, and suggest the METTL3a-mTOR axis as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.",

In Drosophila males, meiotic prophase lasts 3.5 days, during which spermatocytes turn up expression of over 3000 genes and grow 25-fold in volume. Previous work showed that the core cell cycle regulator Cyclin B (CycB) is subject to translational repression in immature Drosophila spermatocytes, mediated by the RNA-binding protein Rbp4 and its partner Fest. Here we show that another spermatocyte-specific protein, Lut, is required for translational repression of cycB in an 8-hour window just before spermatocytes are fully mature. In males mutant for rbp4 or lut, spermatocytes enter and exit the meiotic divisions 6-8 hours earlier than in wild-type. In addition, we show that spermatocyte-specific isoforms of Syncrip (Syp) are required for expression of CycB protein and normal entry into the meiotic divisions. Both Lut and Syp interact with Fest in an RNA-independent manner. Thus a complex of spermatocyte-specific regulators choreograph the timing of expression of CycB protein during male meiotic prophase.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTExpression of a conserved cell cycle component, Cyclin B, is regulated by multiple mechanisms in the Drosophila male germline to dictate the correct timing of meiotic division.",

Here, we aimed to evaluate whether an evolutionary response to size-selective mortality influences the gut microbiome of medaka (Oryzias latipes), how environmental conditions interact with the genetic background of medaka on their microbiota, and the association between microbiome diversity and medaka growth-related traits. To do so, we studied two lineages of medaka with known divergence in foraging efficiency and life history raised under antagonistic size-selective regimes for 10 generations (i.e. the largest or the smallest breeders were removed to mimic fishing-like or natural mortality). In pond mesocosms, the two lineages were subjected to contrasting population density and light intensity (used as proxies of resource availability). We observed significant differences in the gut microbiome composition and richness between the two lines, and this effect was mediated by light intensity. The bacterial richness of fishing-like medaka (small-breeder line) was reduced by 34% under low-light conditions compared to high-light conditions, while it remained unchanged in natural mortality-selected medaka (large-breeder line). However, the observed changes in bacterial richness did not correlate with changes in adult growth rate or body condition. Given the growing evidence about the gut microbiomes importance to host health, more in-depth studies are required to fully understand the role of the microbiome in size-selected organisms and the possible ecosystem-level consequences.",

    "abstract": "The influenza A (IAV) RNA polymerase is an essential driver of IAV evolution. Mutations that the polymerase introduces into viral genome segments during replication are the ultimate source of genetic variation, including within the three subunits of the IAV polymerase (PB2, PB1, and PA). Evolutionary analysis of the IAV polymerase is complicated, because changes in mutation rate, replication speed, and drug resistance involve epistatic interactions among its subunits. In order to study the evolution of the human seasonal H3N2 polymerase since the 1968 pandemic, we identified pairwise evolutionary relationships among [~]7000 H3N2 polymerase sequences using mutual information (MI), which measures the information gained about the identity of one residue when a second residue is known. To account for uneven sampling of viral sequences over time, we developed a weighted MI metric (wMI) and demonstrate that wMI outperforms raw MI through simulations using a well-sampled SARS-CoV-2 dataset. We then constructed wMI networks of the H3N2 polymerase to extend the inherently pairwise wMI statistic to encompass relationships among larger groups of residues. We included HA in the wMI network to distinguish between functional wMI relationships within the polymerase and those potentially due to hitchhiking on antigenic changes in HA. The wMI networks reveal coevolutionary relationships among residues with roles in replication and encapsidation. Inclusion of HA highlighted polymerase-only subgraphs containing residues with roles in the enzymatic functions of the polymerase and host adaptability. This work provides insight into the factors that drive and constrain the rapid evolution of influenza viruses.",

    "abstract": "In facultative symbioses, only a fraction of hosts are associated with a symbiont. Understanding why specific host and symbiont strains are associated can inform us of the evolutionary forces affecting facultative symbioses. Possibilities include ongoing host-symbiont coevolution driven by reciprocal selection, or priority effects that are neutral in respect to the host-symbiont interaction. We hypothesized that ongoing host-symbiont coevolution would lead to higher fitness estimates for naturally co-occurring (native) host and symbiont combinations compared to nonnative combinations. We used the Dictyostelium discoideum - Paraburkholderia bonniea system to test this hypothesis. P. bonniea features a reduced genome size relative to another Paraburkholderia symbiont of D. discoideum, indicating a significant history of coevolution with its host. Facultative symbionts may experience continued genome reduction if coevolution is ongoing, or their genome size may have reached a stable state if the symbiosis has also stabilized. Our work demonstrates that ongoing coevolution is unlikely for D. discoideum and P. bonniea. The system instead represents a stable facultative symbiosis. Specifically associated host and symbiont strains in this system are the result of priority effects, and presently unassociated hosts are simply uncolonized. We find evidence for a virulence-transmission trade-off without host strain specificity, and identify candidate virulence factors in the genomes of P. bonniea strains that may contribute to variation in benevolence.\n\nLay summarySymbiotic relationships between hosts and their microbial partners are prolonged and intimate associations. Some of these relationships are obligatory for both a host and symbiont to survive, while others are facultative and each partner can survive without the other. In the latter case, some host individuals may be associated with a symbiont while others are not. Specific host and symbiont combinations can be the result of reciprocal adaptation between host and symbiont partners so that naturally co-occurring combinations are best suited for each other in terms of their biological fitness. On the other hand, the symbiont that a host is associated with may simply be the symbiont that arrived first, in what is called a priority effect. We sought to determine which possibility best explained naturally co-occurring combinations of host and symbiont strains of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and its symbiont Paraburkholderia bonniea. Our work demonstrates that D. discoideum and P. bonniea are in a stable facultative relationship. Specifically associated host and symbiont combinations are the result of priority effects, and D. discoideum hosts without symbionts are simply uncolonized. This work fills a gap in our understanding of the evolutionary forces affecting facultative symbiotic relationships. We also show for the first time that P. bonniea symbionts can spread among amoeba hosts when they aggregate together during the social stage of their life cycle.",

In the largest males these horns can be three times the length of horns in the two closest sister species. Because this weapon functions as a lever, longer horns should lift with less force than shorter horns (the  paradox of the weakening combatant) unless other elements of the weapon system (e.g., input lever length, muscle mass) evolve to compensate. We used next-generation sequencing approaches to consolidate 23 sample locations into 8 genetically distinguishable populations, reconstructing their historical relationships and providing a comprehensive picture of the evolution of this horn lever system. We show that head horns likely increased in length independently in the Northern and Southern lineages. In both instances this resulted in weaker lifting forces, but this mechanical disadvantage was later ameliorated, to some extent and in some locations, by subsequent reductions to horn length, changes in muscle size, or by an increase in input lever length (head height). Our results reveal an exciting geographic mosaic of differences in weapon size, weapon force, and in the extent and nature of mechanical compensation. Reconstructing the evolution of this weapon system offers critical insights towards meaningfully linking mating system dynamics, selection patterns, and diversity in sexually selected traits.",

Intraspecific polymorphism can manifest in divergent feeding morphology and ecology, often along a benthic-pelagic axis. Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) is a freshwater salmonid known for morphological variation and sympatric polymorphism. In Lake Thingvallavatn, Iceland, four morphs of arctic charr coexist that differ in preferred prey, behaviour, habitat use, and external feeding morphology. We studied variation in six upper and lower jaw bones in adults of the four morphs using geometric morphometrics and univariate statistics. We tested for allometric differences in bone size and shape among morphs, morph effects on bone size and shape, and divergence along the benthic-pelagic axis. We also examined the degree of integration between bone pairs. We found differences in bone size between pelagic and benthic morphs for two bones (dentary and premaxilla). We found clear bone shape divergence along a benthic-pelagic axis in four bones (dentary, articular-angular, premaxilla and maxilla), as well as allometric differences between morphs in the dentary. Most dramatic was the dentary, where morph explained more shape variation than bone size. Comparatively, benthic morphs possess a compact and taller dentary, with shorter dentary palate, consistent with visible (but less prominent) differences in external morphology. As these morphs emerged in the last 10,000 years, these results indicate rapid functional evolution of specific feeding structures in arctic charr. This sets the stage for studies of the genetics and development of rapid and parallel craniofacial evolution.",

Although at present the Namib is culturally dominated by Southwest Bantu-speaking cattle-herders, the region exhibits an extraordinary ethnographic diversity which includes an array of semi-nomadic peoples whose subsistence strategies fall outside the traditional division between foraging and food production and can thus be referred to as \"peripatetic\". Among these small-scale populations are the last speakers of the Kwadi branch of the Khoe-Kwadi language family associated with the introduction of pastoralism into southern Africa (Kwepe), as well as a range of groups whose origins remain enigmatic (Kwisi, Twa and Tjimba). Using genome-wide data from 208 individuals belonging to nine ethnically diverse groups from the Angolan Namib and adjacent areas (Kwepe, Kwisi, Twa, Tjimba, !Xun, Kuvale, Himba, Nyaneka, Ovimbundu) in combination with published data from other regions of Africa, we reconstruct in detail the histories of contact emerging from pre-historic migrations to southern Africa and show that peripatetic groups from southwestern Angola stand out for exhibiting elevated levels of an unique, regionally-specific and highly divergent Pre-Bantu ancestry.

Signatures of middle Miocene admixture between an extinct, possibly European, lineage and the ancestor of South-East Asian pangolins, provides new insights into the early evolutionary history of the group. Demographic trajectories and genome-wide heterozygosity estimates revealed contrasts between continental vs. island populations and species lineages, suggesting that conservation planning should consider intra-specific patterns. With the expected loss of genomic diversity from recent, extensive trafficking not yet been realized in pangolins, we recommend that populations are genetically surveyed to anticipate any deleterious impact of the illegal trade. Finally, we produce a complete set of genomic resources that will be integral for future conservation management and forensic endeavors required for conserving pangolins, including tracing their illegal trade. These include the completion of whole-genomes for pangolins through the first reference genome with long reads for the giant pangolin (Smutsia gigantea) and new draft genomes (~43x-77x) for four additional species, as well as a database of orthologous genes with over 3.4 million polymorphic sites.",

    "abstract": "The insulin-related hormones regulate key life processes in Metazoa, from metabolism to growth, lifespan and aging, through an evolutionarily conserved insulin signalling axis (IIS). In humans the IIS axis is controlled by insulin, two insulin-like growth factors, two isoforms of the insulin receptor (hIR-A and -B), and its homologous IGF-1R. In Drosophila, this signalling engages seven insulin-like hormones (DILP1-7) and a single receptor (dmIR). This report describes the first cryoEM structure of the dmIR ectodomain:DILP5 complex, revealing high structural homology between dmIR and hIR. The excess of DILP5 yields dmIR complex in an asymmetric  T conformation, similar to that observed in some complexes of human IRs. However, dmIR binds three DILP5 molecules in a hitherto-unseen arrangement, showing also dmIR-specific features. This work adds structural support to evolutionary conservation of the IIS axis at the IRs levels, underpinning also a better understanding of an important model organism.",

    "abstract": "Conformational heterogeneity is a defining hallmark of intrinsically disordered proteins and protein regions (IDRs). The functions of IDRs and the emergent cellular phenotypes they control are associated with sequence-specific conformational ensembles. Simulations of conformational ensembles that are based on atomistic and coarse-grained models are routinely used to uncover the sequence-specific interactions that may contribute to IDR functions. These simulations are performed either independently or in conjunction with data from experiments. Functionally relevant features of IDRs can span a range of length scales. Extracting these features requires analysis routines that quantify a range of properties. Here, we describe a new analysis suite SOURSOP, an object-oriented and open-source toolkit designed for the analysis of simulated conformational ensembles of IDRs. SOURSOP implements several analysis routines motivated by principles in polymer physics, offering a unique collection of simple-to-use functions to characterize IDR ensembles. As an extendable framework, SOURSOP supports the development and implementation of new analysis routines that can be easily packaged and shared.",

    "abstract": "In HILO microscopy, a highly inclined and laminated light sheet is used to illuminate the sample, thus drastically reducing background fluorescence in wide-field microscopy, but maintaining the simplicity of the use of a single objective for both illumination and detection. Although the technique has become widely popular, particularly in single-molecule and super-resolution microscopy, a limited understanding of how to finely shape the illumination beam and how this impact on the image quality complicates setting HILO to fit the experimental needs. In this work, we build up a simple and comprehensive guide to optimize the beam shape and alignment in HILO and to predict its performance in conventional fluorescence and super-resolution microscopy. We model the beam propagation through Gaussian optics and validate the model through far- and near-field experiments, thus characterizing the main geometrical features of the beam. Further, we fully quantify the impact of a progressive reduction of the inclined beam thickness on the image quality of both diffraction-limited and super-resolution images and we show that the most relevant impact is obtained by reducing the beam thickness to sub-cellular dimensions (< 3 m). Based on this, we present a simple optical solution to reduce the inclined beam thickness down to 2.6 m while keeping a field-of-view dimension suited for cell imaging and allowing an increase in the number of localizations in super-resolution imaging of up to 2.6 folds.",

    "abstract": "The re-emergence of the high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 in the United Kingdom in 2021-2022 has caused unprecedented epizootic events in wild birds and poultry. During the summer of 2022 there was a shift in virus transmission dynamics resulting in increased HPAIV infection in seabirds and consequently a profound impact on seabird populations. To understand the pathological impact of HPAIV in seabirds, we have evaluated the virus distribution and associated pathological changes in the tissues of great skua (Stercorarius skua, n=8), long tailed skua (Stercorarius longicaudus, n=1), European herring gull (Larus argentatus, n=5), and black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus, n=4). Grossly there was gizzard ulceration in one great skua and pancreatic necrosis in four herring gulls, which were confirmed for virus infection in situ by immunohistochemistry. Microscopical analysis revealed neuro-, pneumo-, lymphoidand cardiotropism of HPAIV H5N1, with the most common virus-associated pathological changes being pancreatic and splenic necrosis. Examination of the reproductive tract of the great skua revealed HPAIV-associated oophoritis and salpingitis, and virus replication within the oviductal epithelium. Across the birds, epitheliotropism was evident in the intestine, nasal turbinate, and trachea. This was, in contrast, not observed in the 2021 summer mortality event in great skuas and may be significant for the disease epidemiology observed in 2022. The emergence of HPAIV in seabirds, particularly during summer 2022, has challenged the dogma of HPAIV dynamics, posing a significant threat to wild bird life with potential implications to the reproductive performance of seabirds of conservation importance.",

    "abstract": "Natural environments of living organisms are often dynamic and multifactorial, with multiple parameters fluctuating over time. To better understand how cells respond to dynamically interacting factors, we quantified the effects of dual fluctuations of osmotic stress and glucose deprivation on yeast cells using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy. Strikingly, we observed that cell proliferation, survival and signaling depend on the phasing of the two periodic stresses. Cells divided faster, survived longer and showed decreased transcriptional response when fluctuations of hyperosmotic stress and glucose deprivation occurred in phase than when the two stresses occurred alternatively. We also found that mutants with impaired osmotic stress response were better adapted to alternating stresses than wild-type cells, showing that genetic mechanisms of adaptation to a persistent stress factor can be detrimental under dynamically interacting conditions. Taken together, we demonstrate that glucose availability regulates yeast responses to dynamic osmotic stress. We anticipate that our approach can be extended to other stress responsive pathways to further elucidate the key role of metabolic fluctuations in the dynamics of cellular responses to stress.",

    "abstract": "Immunoglobulin E is a mammal specific antibody isotype supporting the immune response against parasites and venoms, but also a driver of allergic responses. Prior studies have defined the conformation of the IgE Fc fragment bound to the cell surface receptor Fc{varepsilon}RI and the dynamic properties of the IgE Fc. It remains unknown, how these prior studies translate to the complex of a full antibody including the Fab arms with the receptor. Here we show that in a cryo-EM structure of the IgE Fc{varepsilon}RI complex, IgE adopts a T-like conformation where the antigen binding Fab arms may be parallel to the cell membrane. Two additional conformations are captured in negative stain EM (ns-EM) where the arrangements of the Fab arms differ from the cryo-EM conformation. Small angle scattering data favors the Fc{varepsilon}RI bound IgE conformation observed by cryo-EM, but the major IgE conformation observed by ns-EM possibly may also occur. In all observed conformations of Fc{varepsilon}RI bound IgE, one Fab arm is fixed relative to the IgE Fc moiety whereas the second Fab may alternate its position. Introduction of flexibility in the Fab-Fc hinge diminishes the biological activity of IgE demonstrating a functional role for the observed defined Fab-Fc hinge conformations. Our data show the organization of a full size antibody on its receptor and reveal a new layer of dynamics in Fc{varepsilon}RI bound IgE on top of the well established spectrum of IgE Fc conformations. Development of novel anti-IgE therapeutics may take into account these distinct Fc{varepsilon}RI bound IgE conformations.\n\nSignificance statementIgE represents a canonical antibody isotype and is a key molecule for the allergic immune response to environmental triggers driven by mast cells and basophils. The requirements for efficient mediation of IgEs effects are not fully understood. Here we elucidate the structure of the entire IgE in complex with its high affinity receptor and identify two clearly distinct and dominant conformations, in which one of the Fab arms is fixed relative to the Fc domains. Enforcing IgE flexibility impacts the biological function with potential consequences for the allergic response. This unique behavior makes IgE different from all other isotypes and its understanding sheds light on the allergenic activation of the immune response.",

    "abstract": "The alternative sigma factor RpoS regulates transcription of over 1000 genes in Escherichia coli in response to many different stresses. RpoS levels rise continuously after exposure to stress, and the consequences of changing levels of RpoS for the temporal patterns of expression of RpoS-regulated genes have not been described. We measured RpoS levels at various times during the entry to stationary phase, or in response to high osmolarity or low temperature, and found that the time required to reach maximum levels varied by several hours. We quantified the transcriptome across these stresses using RNA-seq. The number of differentially expressed genes differed among stresses, with 1379 DE genes identified in stationary phase, 633 in high osmolarity, and 302 in cold shock. To quantify the timing of gene expression, we fit sigmoid or double sigmoid models to differentially expressed genes in each stress. During the entry into stationary phase, genes whose expression rose earlier tended to be those that had been found to respond most strongly to low levels of RpoS. The timing of individual genes expression was not correlated across stresses. Taken together, our results demonstrate E. coli activates RpoS with different timing in response to different stresses, which in turn generates a unique pattern of timing of the transcription response to each stress.\n\nImportanceBacteria adapt to changing environments by altering the transcription of their genes. Specific proteins can regulate these changes. This study explored how a single protein called RpoS controls how many genes change expression during adaptation to three stresses. We found that: 1) RpoS is responsible for activating different genes in different stresses; 2) that during a stress, the timing of gene activation depends on the what stress it is, and; 3) that how much RpoS a gene needs in order to be activated can predict when that gene will be activated during the stress of stationary phase.",

We demonstrate cooperation and direct interactions specifically between UPEC and E. faecalis within host cells that corresponded to an increased frequency of host cell infection. 3D imaging showed UPEC rods orientated perpendicular to the major host cell axis within single-species intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs), whereas UPEC cells often enveloped E. faecalis in multispecies IBCs. Furthermore, during dispersal from host cells, only the Gram-negative bacteria underwent infection-related filamentation (IRF) in multispecies infections.

When applied to a Crohns disease case-control study, our approach identified a lack of species with the ability to consume hydrogen sulphide as the main distinguishing microbiome feature of disease.

    "abstract": "Ergosterol, the major sterol in fungal membranes, is critical for defining membrane fluidity and regulating cellular processes. Although ergosterol synthesis has been well defined in model yeast, little is known about sterol organization in the context of fungal pathogenesis. We identified a retrograde sterol transporter, Ysp2, in the opportunistic fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. We found that the lack of Ysp2 under host-mimicking conditions leads to abnormal accumulation of ergosterol at the plasma membrane, invagination of the plasma membrane, and malformation of the cell wall, which can be functionally rescued by inhibiting ergosterol synthesis with the antifungal drug fluconazole. We also observed that cells lacking Ysp2 mislocalize the cell surface protein Pma1 and have thinner and more permeable capsules. As a result of perturbed ergosterol distribution and its consequences, ysp2{Delta} cells cannot survive in physiologically-rele-vant environments such as host phagocytes and are dramatically attenuated in virulence. These findings expand our knowledge of cryptococcal biology and underscore the importance of sterol homeostasis in fungal pathogenesis.\n\nIMPORTANCECryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that kills over 100,000 people worldwide each year. Only three drugs are available to treat cryptococcosis, and these are variously limited by toxicity, availability, cost, and resistance. Ergosterol is the most abundant sterol in fungi and a key component in modulating membrane behavior. Two of the drugs used for cryptococcal infection, amphotericin B and fluconazole, target this lipid and its synthesis, highlighting its importance as a therapeutic target. We discovered a cryptococcal ergosterol transporter, Ysp2, and demonstrated its key roles in multiple aspects of cryptococcal biology and pathogenesis. These studies demonstrate the role of ergosterol homeostasis in C. neoformans virulence, deepen our understanding of a pathway with proven therapeutic importance, and open a new area of study.",

    "abstract": "Specificity of control over virtually all essential cellular functions by Ca2+ is based on the existence of separated, autonomic signaling modules. Spatiotemporal definition of Ca2+ signals involves the assembly of signaling complexes within the nano-architecture of contact sites between the sarco/endoplasmic (SR/ER) reticulum and the plasma membrane (PM). While the requirement of precise spatial assembly and positioning of the junctional signaling elements is well documented, the role of the nano-scale membrane architecture itself, as an ion reflecting confinement of the signaling unit, remains as yet elusive. Utilizing the NCX1/SERCA2-mediated ER Ca2+ refilling process as a junctional signalling paradigm, we provide here the first evidence for an indispensable cellular function of the junctional membrane architecture. Our stochastic modeling approach demonstrates that junctional ER Ca2+refilling operates exclusively at nano-scale membrane spacing, with a strong inverse relationship between junctional width and signaling efficiency. Our model predicts a breakdown of junctional Ca2+ signaling with loss of reflecting membrane confinement, irrespective of the spatial positioning of the molecular signaling elements. Alterations in the molecular and nano-scale membrane organization at organelle-PM contacts are suggested as new concept in pathophysiology.",

The loss of Nr2f2 results in ectopic CA1/CA3 domains in the ventral hippocampus. The deficiency of Nr2f1 leads to the failed specification of dorsal CA1, among which there are place cells. The deletion of both Nr2f genes causes almost agenesis of the hippocampus with abnormalities of trisynaptic circuit and adult neurogenesis. Moreover, Nr2f1/2 may cooperate to guarantee appropriate morphogenesis and function of the hippocampus by regulating the Lhx5-Lhx2 axis. Our findings revealed a novel mechanism that Nr2f1 and Nr2f2 converge to govern the differentiation and integration of distinct characteristics of the hippocampus in mice.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFungi use the accessory segments of their pan-genomes to adapt to their environments. While gene presence-absence variation (PAV) contributes to shaping these accessory gene reservoirs, whether these events happen in specific genomic contexts remains unclear. Additionally, since pan-genome studies often group together all members of the same species, it is uncertain whether genomic or epigenomic features shaping pan-genome evolution are consistent across populations within the same species. Fungal plant pathogens are useful models for answering these questions because members of the same species often infect distinct hosts, and they frequently rely on gene PAV to adapt to these hosts.\n\nResultsWe analyzed gene PAV in the rice and wheat blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, and found that PAV of disease-causing effectors, antibiotic production, and non-self-recognition genes may drive the adaptation of the fungus to its environment. We then analyzed genomic and epigenomic features and data from available datasets for patterns that might help explain these PAV events. We observed that proximity to transposable elements (TEs), gene GC content, gene length, expression level in the host, and histone H3K27me3 marks were different between PAV genes and conserved genes, among other features. We used these features to construct a random forest classifier that was able to predict whether a gene is likely to experience PAV with high precision (86.06%) and recall (92.88%) in rice-infecting M. oryzae. Finally, we found that PAV in wheat- and rice-infecting pathotypes of M. oryzae differed in their number and their genomic context.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest that genomic and epigenomic features of gene PAV can be used to better understand and even predict fungal pan-genome evolution. We also show that substantial intra-species variation can exist in these features.",

    "abstract": "While microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs are the next frontier of novel regulators of mammalian ribosome biogenesis (RB), a systematic exploration of microRNA-mediated RB regulation has not yet been undertaken. We carried out a high-content screen in MCF10A cells for changes in nucleolar number using a library of 2,603 mature human microRNA mimics. Following a secondary screen for nucleolar rRNA biogenesis inhibition, we identified 72 novel microRNA negative regulators of RB after stringent hit calling. Hits were enriched for mRNA targets encoding proteins with nucleolar localization or functions in cell cycle regulation. Rigorous selection and validation of a subset of 15 microRNA hits unexpectedly revealed that most of them caused dysregulated pre-rRNA processing, elucidating a novel role for microRNAs in RB regulation. Almost all 15 hits impaired global protein synthesis and upregulated CDKN1A (p21) levels, but caused diverse effects on RNA Polymerase 1 (RNAP1) transcription and TP53 protein levels. We defined RPS28 as a direct target of the MIR-28 siblings, hsa-miR-28-5p and hsa-miR-708-5p, which caused a severe pre-18S pre-rRNA processing defect, and uncovered SPRR3s novel role in promoting RNAP1 transcription. Our work illuminates novel microRNA attenuators of RB, forging a promising new path for microRNA mimic chemotherapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The normally antiviral enzyme APOBEC3A1-4 is an endogenous mutagen in many different human cancers5-7, where it becomes hijacked to fuel tumor evolvability. APOBEC3As single-stranded DNA C-to-U editing activity1, 8 results in multiple mutagenic outcomes including signature single-base substitution mutations (isolated and clustered), DNA breakage, and larger-scale chromosomal aberrations5-7. Transgenic expression in mice demonstrates its tumorigenic potential9. APOBEC3A inhibitors may therefore comprise a novel class of anticancer agents that work by blocking mutagenesis, preventing tumor evolvability, and lessening detrimental outcomes such as drug resistance and metastasis. Here we reveal the structural basis of competitive inhibition of wildtype APOBEC3A by hairpin DNA bearing 2-deoxy-5-fluorozebularine in place of the cytidine in the TC recognition motif that is part of a three-nucleotide loop. The nuclease-resistant phosphorothioated derivatives of these inhibitors maintain nanomolar in vitro potency against APOBEC3A, localize to the cell nucleus, and block APOBEC3A activity in human cells. These results combine to suggest roles for these inhibitors to study A3A activity in living cells, potentially as conjuvants, leading toward next-generation, combinatorial anti-mutator and anti-cancer therapies.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsO-GlcNAcylation is a post-translational modification catalyzed by the enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which transfers a single N-acetylglucosamine sugar from UDP-GlcNAc to the protein on serine and threonine residues on proteins. Another enzyme, O-GlcNAcase (OGA), removes this modification. O-GlcNAcylation plays an important role in pathophysiology. Here, we report that O-GlcNAcylation is essential for hepatocyte differentiation, and chronic loss results in fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nMethodsSingle-cell RNA-sequencing was used to investigate hepatocyte differentiation in hepatocyte-specific OGT-KO mice with increased hepatic O-GlcNAcylation and in OGA-KO mice with decreased O-GlcNAcylation in hepatocytes. HCC patient samples and the DEN-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model were used to investigate the effect of modulation of O-GlcNAcylation on the development of liver cancer.\n\nResultsLoss of hepatic O-GlcNAcylation resulted in disruption of liver zonation. Periportal hepatocytes were the most affected by loss of differentiation characterized by dysregulation of glycogen storage and glucose production. OGT-KO mice exacerbated DEN-induced HCC development with increased inflammation, fibrosis, and YAP signaling. Consistently, OGA-KO mice with increased hepatic O-GlcNAcylation inhibited DEN-induced HCC. A progressive loss of O-GlcNAcylation was observed in HCC patients.\n\nConclusionsOur study shows that O-GlcNAcylation is a critical regulator of hepatic differentiation, and loss of O-GlcNAcylation promotes hepatocarcinogenesis. These data highlight increasing O-GlcNAcylation as a potential therapy in chronic liver diseases, including HCC.\n\nLay SummaryProteins in cells are modified by the addition of a single glucosamine sugar molecule called O-GlcNAcylation. Loss of O-GlcNAcylation in hepatocytes, the most common type of cells in the liver, causes the liver to lose its function and can result in increased liver diseases such as fibrosis and cancer.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=85 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/528884v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@aed343org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b00966org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@391ef9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@206d8c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LISingle-Cell RNA-sequencing reveals loss of metabolic liver zonation in O-GlcNAcylation deficient livers.\nC_LIO_LILoss of O-GlcNAcylation promoted DEN-Induced HCC.\nC_LIO_LIIncrease of hepatic O-GlcNAcylation prevented HCC progression.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Sequence assignment is a key step of the model building process in both cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and macromolecular crystallography (MX). If the assignment fails, it can result in difficult to identify errors affecting the interpretation of a model. There are many model validation strategies that help experimentalists in this step of protein model building, but they are virtually non-existent for nucleic acids. Here I present doubleHelix - a comprehensive method for assignment, identification, and validation of nucleic acid sequences in structures determined using cryo-EM and MX. The method combines a neural network classifier of nucleobase identities and a sequence-independent secondary structure assignment approach. I show that the presented method can successfully assist model building at lower resolutions, where visual map interpretation is very difficult. Moreover, I present examples of sequence assignment errors detected using doubleHelix in cryo-EM and MX structures of ribosomes deposited in the Protein Data Bank, which escaped the scrutiny of available model-validation approaches.\n\nThe doubleHelix program source code is available under BSD-3 license at https://gitlab.com/gchojnowski/doublehelix.",

    "abstract": "Melanoma arises from transformation of melanocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis where they are surrounded by keratinocytes, with which they interact through cell contact and paracrine communication. Considerable effort has been devoted to determining how the accumulation of oncogene and tumor suppressor gene mutations in melanocytes drive melanoma development. However, the extent to which alterations in keratinocytes that occur in the developing tumor niche serve as extrinsic drivers of melanoma initiation and progression is poorly understood. We recently identified the keratinocyte-specific cadherin, desmoglein 1 (Dsg1), as an important mediator of keratinocyte:melanoma cell crosstalk, demonstrating that its chronic loss, which can occur through melanoma cell-dependent paracrine signaling, promotes behaviors that mimic a malignant phenotype. Here we address the extent to which Dsg1 loss affects early steps in melanomagenesis. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that paracrine signals from Dsg1-deficient keratinocytes mediate a transcriptional switch from a differentiated to undifferentiated cell state in melanocytes expressing BRAFV600E, a driver mutation commonly present in both melanoma and benign nevi and reported to cause growth arrest and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Of [~]220 differentially expressed genes in BRAFV600E cells treated with Dsg1-deficient conditioned media (CM), the laminin superfamily member NTN4/Netrin-4, which inhibits senescence in endothelial cells, stood out. Indeed, while BRAFV600E melanocytes treated with Dsg1-deficient CM showed signs of senescence bypass as assessed by increased senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase activity and decreased p16, knockdown of NTN4 reversed these effects. These results suggest that Dsg1 loss in keratinocytes provides an extrinsic signal to push melanocytes towards oncogenic transformation once an initial mutation has been introduced.",
