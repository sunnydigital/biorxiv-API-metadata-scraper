    "abstract": "Assessing the extinction risk of species through the IUCN Red List is key to guiding conservation policies and reducing biodiversity loss. This process is resource-demanding, however, and requires a continuous update which becomes increasingly difficult as new species are added to the IUCN Red List. The use of automatic methods, such as comparative analyses to predict species extinction risk, can be an efficient alternative to maintaining up to date assessments. Using amphibians as a study group, we predict which species were more likely to change status, in order to suggest species that should be prioritized for reassessment. We used species traits, environmental variables, and proxies of climate and land-use change as predictors of the IUCN Red List category of species. We produced an ensemble prediction of IUCN Red List categories by combining four different model algorithms: Cumulative Link Models (CLM), phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS), Random Forests (RF), Neural Networks (NN). By comparing IUCN Red List categories with the ensemble prediction, and accounting for uncertainty among model algorithms, we identified species that should be prioritized for future reassessments due to high prediction versus observation mismatch. We found that CLM and RF performed better than PGLS and NN, but there was not a clear best algorithm. The most important predicting variables across models were species range size, climate change, and landuse change. We propose ensemble modelling of extinction risk as a promising tool for prioritizing species for reassessment while accounting for inherent models uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Social behavior emerges early in development, a time marked by the onset of neurodevelopmental disorders featuring social deficits, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although deficits in social interaction and communication are at the core of the clinical diagnosis of ASD, very little is known about their neural correlates at the time of clinical onset of the disorder. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region extensively implicated in social behavior, undergoes synaptic, cellular and molecular alterations in early life, and is particularly affected in ASD mouse models. To explore a link between the maturation of the NAc and neurodevelopmental deficits in social behavior, we compared age-dependent changes in spontaneous synaptic transmission in NAc shell medium spiny neurons (MSNs) between the highly social C57BL/6J mouse strain and the idiopathic ASD mouse model BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J at postnatal day (P) 4, P6, P8, P12, P15, P21 and P30. We found that MSNs from both C57BL/6J and BTBR mice display age-dependent increases in spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents between P4 and P30. Comparison of NAc spontaneous transmission between strains showed that BTBR MSNs display increased excitatory transmission during the first postnatal week, and increased inhibition across the first, second and fourth postnatal weeks, suggesting accelerated maturation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto BTBR MSNs compared to C57BL/6J mice. These early life changes in synaptic transmission are consistent with a potential critical period in the maturation of the NAc, which could maximize the efficacy of interventions affecting social behavior. To test this possibility, we treated BTBR mice in either early life (P4-P8) or adulthood (P60-P64) with the mTORC1 antagonist rapamycin, a well-established rescue intervention for ASD-like behavior. We found that rapamycin treatment rescued social interaction deficits in BTBR mice when injected in infancy, but not in adulthood. These data emphasize the importance of studying brain regions involved in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders at clinically-relevant time points, which may offer novel insight into the timing and targets of therapeutic interventions to maximize positive outcomes.",
