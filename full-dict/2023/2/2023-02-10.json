    "abstract": "Despite mediating several essential processes in the brain, including during development, cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) remains a poorly characterized human protein kinase. Accordingly, its substrates, functions, and regulatory mechanisms have not been fully described. We realized that availability of a potent and selective small molecule probe targeting CDKL5 could enable illumination of its roles in normal development as well as in diseases where it has become aberrant due to mutation. We prepared analogs of AT-7519, a known inhibitor of several cyclin dependent and cyclin-dependent kinase-like kinases that has been advanced into Phase II clinical trials. We identified analog 2 as a highly potent and cell-active chemical probe for CDKL5/GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3). Evaluation of its kinome-wide selectivity confirmed that analog 2 demonstrates excellent selectivity and only retains GSK3/{beta} affinity. As confirmation that our chemical probe is a high-quality tool to use in directed biological studies, we demonstrated inhibition of downstream CDKL5 and GSK3/{beta} signaling and solved a co-crystal structure of analog 2 bound to CDKL5. A structurally similar analog (4) proved to lack CDKL5 affinity and maintain potent and selective inhibition of GSK3/{beta}. Finally, we used our chemical probe pair (2 and 4) to demonstrate that inhibition of CDKL5 and/or GSK3/{beta} promotes the survival of human motor neurons exposed to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We have demonstrated a neuroprotective phenotype elicited by our chemical probe pair and exemplified the utility of our compounds to characterize the role of CDKL5/GSK3 in neurons and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Reproductive aging is one of the earliest aging phenotypes, and mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to a decline in oocyte quality. However, the mitochondria-related processes that are critical for oocyte quality maintenance with age have not been fully identified. We isolated mitochondria from young and aged wild-type and long-reproductive daf-2 mutant C. elegans for proteomic analysis. We found that the mitochondrial proteomic profiles of young wild-type and daf-2 worms are similar and are distinct from mitochondrial proteins of aged wild-type animals. The first enzyme of the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism pathway, BCAT-1, is more abundant in young and daf-2 mitochondria. Upon knockdown of bcat-1 in daf-2, reproduction is shortened, mitochondrial ROS levels are elevated, and mitochondria shift to a perinuclear distribution within the mature oocytes. Moreover, bcat-1 knockdown decreases daf-2 oocyte quality and reduces reproductive capability in late age, indicating the importance of this pathway in the maintenance of oocyte quality with age. Importantly, we can extend reproduction in wild-type animals both by bcat-1 overexpression and by supplementing vitamin B1, a cofactor needed for the BCAA metabolism.\n\nHighlightsO_LIBCAT-1 is abundant in mitochondria isolated from young wild-type worms and the long-lived mutant daf-2.\nC_LIO_LIDownregulating bcat-1 in daf-2 mutants reduces daf-2 reproductive span, alters mitochondrial oocyte distribution, and elevates mtROS in mature oocytes.\nC_LIO_LIOverexpression of bcat-1 extends reproductive capability.\nC_LIO_LISupplementation with thiamine (vitamin B1) extends reproductive capability.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Individual cells give rise to diverse cell lineages during the development of multicellular organisms. Understanding the contribution of these lineages to mature organisms is a central question of developmental biology. Several techniques to document cell lineages have been used, from marking single cells with mutations that express a visible marker to generating molecular bar codes by CRISPR-induced mutations and subsequent single-cell analysis. Here, we exploit the mutagenic activity of CRISPR to allow lineage tracing within living plants. Cas9-induced mutations are directed to correct a frameshift mutation that restores expression of a nuclear fluorescent protein, labelling the initial cell and all progenitor cells with a strong signal without modifying other phenotypes of the plants. Spatial and temporal control of Cas9 activity can be achieved using tissue-specific and/or inducible promoters. We provide proof of principle for the function of lineage tracing in two model plants. The conserved features of the components and the versatile cloning system, allowing for easy exchange of promoters, are expected to make the system widely applicable.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTBy targeting Cas9 in a tissue- and time-specific way to correct a frameshift mutation, resulting in fluorescence labelling of nuclei, we generated a method for in vivo visual lineage tracing in two model plants. The versatile cloning system makes the system widely applicable in other plants.",

    "abstract": "In response to nutritional stress, microtubules in cells of the Drosophila female germline are depleted from the cytoplasm and accumulate cortically. This triggers aggregation of mRNPs into large reticulated sponge bodies and oogenesis arrest. Here, we show that hyperacetylation of -tubulin at lysine 40 (K40) alters microtubule dynamics and sponge body formation. We found that depletion of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) by RNAi phenocopies the nutritional stress response, causing hyperacetylation of -tubulin, as well as accumulation of maternally deposited mRNPs in reticulated sponge bodies. Using in vitro and in vivo studies, we identify HDAC1 as a direct regulator of -tubulin K40 acetylation status. In well-fed flies, HDAC1 maintains low levels of -tubulin acetylation, enabling the microtubule dynamics required for mRNP transport. Using quantitative phosphoproteomics we identify nutritional stress-induced changes in protein phosphorylation that act upstream of -tubulin acetylation, including phosphorylation of HDAC1 at S391, which reduces its ability to deacetylate -tubulin. These results reveal that Drosophila HDAC1 senses and relays the nutritional status, which regulates germline development through modulation of cytoskeleton dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical stimuli arising from fetal movements are critical factors underlying joint growth. Abnormal fetal movements negatively affect joint shape features with important implications for joint function and health, but the mechanisms by which mechanical forces due to fetal movements influence joint growth are still unclear. In this research, we integrated cell-level data into a novel mechanobiological model of zebrafish jaw joint morphogenesis to identify links between the mechanical stimuli arising from movement and patterns of growth. Larval zebrafish jaw joint growth patterns were quantified from tracked cell-data at several successive developmental stages in the presence or absence of movements. Pharmacological immobilisation, prior to the onset of jaw movements, resulted in growth rate decreases which were stronger along the ventrodorsal axis. Simulations of joint morphogenesis, based on the quantified cell-level data and which integrated mechanical stimuli arising from simulated jaw movements, were used to test hypotheses relating specific mechanical stimuli with the local changes in size and shape. Different types of mechanical stimulation were incorporated into the simulation to provide the mechanoregulated component on growth in addition to the baseline (non mechanoregulated) growth which occurs in the immobilised animals. We found that the magnitude of compression experienced during joint motion when included as the stimulus for mechanoregulated growth could not predict the real, normally loaded shaped joints. However, when the dynamic changes caused by the application of cyclical compression was implemented as the stimulus for mechanoregulated growth, the sizes and shapes of joints were correctly simulated. We conclude therefore that the cyclical application of compression loading due to the dynamic nature of fetal movements underlies the mechanoregulation of prenatal joint morphogenesis. Our results provide a fundamental advance in our understanding of mechanoregulation of the developing joint and increase our understanding of the origins of conditions such as hip dysplasia and arthrogryposis.\n\nAuthor summaryThe mechanical forces caused by fetal movements are important for normal development of the skeleton, and in particular for joint shape. Several common developmental musculoskeletal conditions such as developmental dysplasia of the hip and arthrogryposis are associated with reduced or restricted fetal movements. Paediatric joint malformations impair joint function and can be debilitating. To understand the origins of such conditions, it is essential to understand how the mechanical forces arising from movements influence joint growth and shape. In this research, we used a computational model of joint growth applied to the zebrafish jaw joint to study the impact of fetal movements on joint growth and shape. We find that the cyclical application of compression loading is critical to the normal growth and shape of the developing joint. Our findings implicate that dynamic compression must be targeted when developing strategies for the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions through targeted physiotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Transcription often occurs in bursts as gene promoters switch stochastically between active and inactive states. Enhancers can dictate transcriptional activity in animal development through the modulation of burst frequency, duration, or amplitude. Previous studies observed that different enhancers can achieve a wide range of transcriptional outputs through the same strategies of bursting control. For example, despite responding to different transcription factors, all even-skipped enhancers increase transcription by upregulating burst frequency and amplitude while burst duration remains largely constant. These shared bursting strategies suggest that a unified molecular mechanism constraints how enhancers modulate transcriptional output. Alternatively, different enhancers could have converged on the same bursting control strategy because of natural selection favoring one of these particular strategies. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we compared transcriptional bursting between endogenous and ectopic gene expression patterns. Because enhancers act under different regulatory inputs in ectopic patterns, dissimilar bursting control strategies between endogenous and ectopic patterns would suggest that enhancers adapted their bursting strategies to their trans-regulatory environment. Here, we generated ectopic even-skipped transcription patterns in fruit fly embryos and discovered that bursting strategies remain consistent in endogenous and ectopic even-skipped expression. These results provide evidence for a unified molecular mechanism shaping even-skipped bursting strategies and serve as a starting point to uncover the realm of strategies employed by other enhancers.",

    "abstract": "As cells exit the pluripotent state and begin to commit to a specific lineage they must activate genes appropriate for that lineage while silencing genes associated with pluripotency and preventing activation of lineage-inappropriate genes. The Nucleosome Remodelling and Deacetylation (NuRD) complex is essential for pluripotent cells to successfully undergo lineage commitment. NuRD controls nucleosome density at regulatory sequences to facilitate transcriptional responses, and also has been shown to prevent unscheduled transcription (transcriptional noise) in undifferentiated pluripotent cells. How these activities combine to ensure cells engage a gene expression program suitable for successful lineage commitment has not been determined. Here we show that while NuRD is not required to silence all genes, its activity is important to restrict expression of genes primed for activation upon exit from the pluripotent state, and that NuRD activity facilitates their subsequent transcriptional activation. We further show that NuRD coordinates gene expression changes, which acts to maintain a barrier between different stable states. Thus NuRD-mediated chromatin remodelling serves multiple functions, including reducing transcriptional noise, priming genes for activation and coordinating the transcriptional response to facilitate lineage commitment.",

    "abstract": "Although Bathycoccus is one of the most abundant picophytoplankton, little is known about the genetic diversity underlying its adaptation to ecological niches. In this study, the diversity of Bathycoccus populations during their annual bloom in the Mediterranean bay of Banyuls France was assessed by an INDEL based approach. Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) was used to characterise structural variants (SV) among the genomes of Bathycoccus sampled from geographically distinct regions in the world ocean. Markers derived from INDEL were validated by PCR and sequencing in the world-wide strains. These markers were then used to genotype 55 Bathycoccus strains isolated during the winter bloom 2018-2019 in Banyuls. With five markers, eight Multi Loci Genotypes (MLG) were determined, two of which represented 53% and 29% of the isolates. Physiological studies confirmed that isolates are phenotypically different, cells isolated in February growing better at low temperature than those isolated in December. When tested on environmental samples, two diversity markers showed a similar allele frequency in sea water as in individual Bathycoccus strains isolated at the same period. We conclude that these markers constitute a resource to identify the most abundant variant alleles in a given bloom. A follow-up on three consecutive blooms revealed differences in allele abundance during the course of a bloom, particularly at initiation, and between years. In addition to Bathycoccus prasinos, two other species of Bathycoccus were identified including the recently described species B. calidus and a novel species B. catiminus, suggesting that species diversity of the genus Bathycoccus may be underestimated.",

    "abstract": "AimThe drivers and dynamics of initial human migrations across individual islands and archipelagos are poorly understood, affecting assessments of human-modification of island biodiversity. Here, we describe and test a process-explicit approach for reconstructing human arrival and expansion on islands, which combines archaeological and climate records with high-resolution spatial population models. Using Polynesian colonisation of New Zealand as an example, we show that our new method can generate information crucial for assessing how humans affected biodiversity on islands.\n\nInnovationThe transition of islands from prehuman to human dominated ecosystems has typically been assessed by comparing biodiversity before and after time of first arrival, without considering the potential importance of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the human expansion event. Our new approach, which uses pattern-oriented modelling methods to combine inferences of human colonisation dynamics from dated archaeological material with spatially explicit population models, produces validated reconstructions of the pattern and pace of human migration across islands at high spatiotemporal resolutions. From these reconstructions, demographic and environmental drivers of human colonization can be identified, and the role that people had on biodiversity established. Using this technique, we show that closely reconciling inferences of Polynesian colonisation of New Zealand requires there to have been a single founding population of approximately 500 people, arriving between 1233 and 1257 AD, settling multiple areas, and expanding quickly over both North and South islands. The resultant maps of M[a]ori colonisation dynamics provide new opportunities to better determine how human activities transformed biodiversity of New Zealand in space and time.\n\nMain conclusionsProcess-explicit models can reconstruct human migration across large islands, producing validated, high resolution spatiotemporal projections of human occupancy and abundance that account for dispersal and population dynamics. This modelling framework should prove effective across any islands and archipelagos where climate and archaeological records are available.",

    "abstract": "The depletion of oxygen as a result of increased stratification and decreased oxygen solubility is one of the most significant chemical changes occurring in aquatic ecosystems as a result of global environmental change. Hence, more aquatic organisms will be exposed to hypoxic conditions over time. Deciphering the effects of hypoxia on strong ecological interactors in this ecosystems food web is critical for predicting how aquatic communities can respond to such an environmental disturbance. Here, (sub-)lethal effects of hypoxia and whether these are genotype specific in Daphnia, a keystone species of freshwater ecosystems, are studied. This is especially relevant upon studying genetic responses with respect to phenotypic switches (G x E interactions) upon environmental stress. Further, we investigated the effect of hypoxia on the Daphnia microbial community to test if the microbiome plays a role in the phenotypic switch and tolerance to hypoxia. For this, two Daphnia genotypes were exposed for two weeks to either hypoxia or normoxia and host performance was monitored together with changes in the host associated and free-living microbial community after this period. We found G x E interactions for some of the tested Daphnia performance traits. The microbial community responded to hypoxia stress with responses in the bacterioplankton and in the Daphnia associated microbial community with respect to species richness and community composition and structure. The latter response was different for the two genotypes suggesting that the microbiome plays an important role in G x E interactions with respect to hypoxia tolerance in Daphnia, but further testing (e.g. through microbiome transplants) is needed to confirm this.",

In other rats, CRISPR-Cas9 technology was used to remove Y chromosome factors that initiate testis differentiation, producing fertile XY gonadal females that have XX and XY progeny with ovaries. These groups can be compared to detect sex differences caused by sex chromosome complement (XX vs. XY) and/or by gonadal hormones (rats with testes vs. ovaries).\n\nResultsWe have measured numerous phenotypes to characterize this model, including gonadal histology, breeding performance, anogenital distance, levels of reproductive hormones, body and organ weights, and central nervous system sexual dimorphisms. Serum testosterone levels were comparable in adult XX and XY gonadal males. Numerous phenotypes previously found to be sexually differentiated by the action of gonadal hormones were found to be similar in XX and XY rats with the same type of gonad, suggesting that XX and XY rats with the same type of gonad have comparable levels of gonadal hormones at various stages of development.\n\nConclusionThe results establish a powerful new model to discriminate sex chromosome and gonadal hormone effects that cause sexual differences in rat physiology and disease.",

    "abstract": "The Fusarium oxysporum species complex (FOSC) includes both plant and human pathogens that cause devastating plant vascular wilt diseases and threaten public health. Each F. oxysporum genome comprises core chromosomes (CCs) for housekeeping functions and accessory chromosomes (ACs) that contribute to host-specific adaptation. This study inspected global transcription factor profiles (TFomes) and their potential roles in coordinating CCs and ACs functions to accomplish host-specific pathogenicity. Remarkably, we found a clear positive correlation between the sizes of TFome and proteome of an organism, and FOSC TFomes are larger due to the acquisition of ACs. Among a total of 48 classified TF families, 14 families involved in transcription/translation regulations and cell cycle controls are highly conserved. Among 30 FOSC expanded families, Zn2-C6 and Znf_C2H2 are most significantly expanded to 671 and 167 genes per family, including well-characterized homologs of Ftf1 (Zn2-C6) and PacC (Znf_C2H2) involved in host-specific interactions. Manual curation of characterized TFs increased the TFome repertoires by 3%, including a disordered protein Ren1. Expression profiles revealed a steady expression of conserved TF families and specific activation of AC TFs. Functional characterization of these TFs could enhance our understanding of transcriptional regulation involved in FOSC cross-kingdom interactions, disentangle species-specific adaptation, and identify targets to combat diverse diseases caused by this group of fungal pathogens.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFriedreichs Ataxia (FRDA) is the most prevalent inherited ataxia; the disease results from loss of Frataxin, an essential mitochondrial iron trafficking protein. FRDA presents as neurodegeneration of the dorsal root ganglion and cerebellar dentate nuclei, followed by brain iron accumulation in the latter. End stage disease includes cardiac fibrosis that contributes to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The microvasculature plays an essential barrier role in both the brain and heart, thus an investigation of this tissue system in FRDA is essential to the delineation of the cellular dysfunction in this genetic disorder. Here, we investigate brain microvascular endothelial cell integrity in FRDA in a model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB).\n\nMethodsWe used lentiviral mediated shRNA delivery to generate a novel FRDA model in immortalized human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVEC) that compose the microcapillaries of the BBB. We verified known cellular pathophysiologies of FXN knockdown including increased oxidative stress, loss of energy metabolism, and increased cell size. Furthermore, we investigated cytoskeletal architecture including the abundance and organization of filamentous actin, and barrier physiology via transendothelial electrical resistance and fluorescent tracer flux.\n\nResultsshFXN hBMVEC display the known FRDA cell morbidity including increased oxidative stress, decreased energy metabolism, and an increase in cell size. We demonstrate that shFXN hBMVEC have less overall filamentous actin, and that filamentous actin is lost at the cell membrane and cortical actin ring. Consistent with loss of cytoskeletal structure and anchorage, we found decreased barrier strength and increased paracellular tracer flux in the shFXN hBMVEC transwell model.\n\nConclusionWe identified that insufficient FXN levels in the hBMVEC BBB model causes changes in cytoskeletal architecture and increased barrier permeability, cell pathologies that may be related to patient brain iron accumulation, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and stroke. Our findings implicate other barrier cells, e.g., the cardiac microvasculature, likely contributory also to disease pathology in FRDA.",

    "abstract": "Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems enable easy in vitro expression of proteins with many scientific, industrial, and therapeutic applications. Here we present an optimized, highly efficient human cell-free translation system that bypasses many limitations of currently used in vitro systems. This CFPS system is based on extracts from human HEK293T cells engineered to endogenously express GADD34 and K3L proteins, which suppress phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2. Overexpression of GADD34 and K3L proteins in human cells significantly simplifies cell lysate preparation. The new CFPS system improves the translation of 5 cap-dependent mRNAs as well as those that use internal ribosome entry site (IRES) mediated translation initiation. We find that expression of the GADD34 and K3L accessory proteins before cell lysis maintains low levels of phosphorylation of eIF2 in the extracts. During in vitro translation reactions, eIF2 phosphorylation increases moderately in a GCN2-dependent fashion that can be inhibited by GCN2 kinase inhibitors. We also find evidence for activation of regulatory pathways related to eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) phosphorylation and ribosome quality control in the extracts. This new CFPS system should be useful for exploring human translation mechanisms in more physiological conditions outside the cell.",

By activating cyclic AMP and Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling while inhibiting the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta}) pathway, cARLA synergistically enhances barrier tightness in a range of BBB models. We demonstrate that, upon cARLA treatment, human stem cell-derived endothelial cells have lower rates of transcytosis, higher glycocalyx density and increased efflux pump activity with a shift in gene expressional profile towards the in vivo brain endothelial signature.

    "abstract": "Advances in machine learning (ML) and the availability of protein sequences via high-throughput sequencing techniques have transformed our ability to design novel diagnostic and therapeutic proteins. ML allows protein engineers to capture complex trends hidden within protein sequences that would otherwise be difficult to identify in the context of the immense and rugged protein fitness landscape. Despite this potential, there persists a need for guidance during the training and evaluation of ML methods over sequencing data. Two key challenges for training discriminative models and evaluating their performance include handling severely imbalanced datasets (e.g., few high-fitness proteins among an abundance of non-functional proteins) and selecting appropriate protein sequence representations. Here, we present a framework for applying ML over assay-labeled datasets to elucidate the capacity of sampling methods and protein representations to improve model performance in two different datasets with binding affinity and thermal stability prediction tasks. For protein sequence representations, we incorporate two widely used methods (One-Hot encoding, physiochemical encoding) and two language-based methods (next-token prediction, UniRep; masked-token prediction, ESM). Elaboration on performance is provided over protein fitness, length, data size, and sampling methods. In addition, an ensemble of representation methods is generated to discover the contribution of distinct representations to the final prediction score. Within the context of these datasets, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) outperformed undersampling while encoding sequences with One-Hot, UniRep, and ESM representations. In addition, ensemble learning increased the predictive performance of the affinity-based dataset by 4% compared to the best single encoding candidate (F1-score = 97%), while ESM alone was rigorous enough in stability prediction (F1-score = 92%).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundComplex human diseases are defined not only by sophisticated patterns of genetic variants/mutations upstream but also by many interplaying genes, RNAs, and proteins downstream. Analyzing multiple genomic and functional genomic data types to determine a short list of genes or molecules of interest is a common task called \"gene prioritization\" in biology. There are many statistical, biological, and bioinformatic methods developed to perform gene prioritization tasks. However, little research has been conducted to examine the relationships among the technique used, merged/separate use of each data modality, the gene lists network/pathway context, and various gene ranking/expansions.\n\nMethodsWe introduce a new analytical framework called \"Gene Ranking and Iterative Prioritization based on Pathways\" (GRIPP) to prioritize genes derived from different modalities. Multiple data sources, such as CBioPortal, PAGER, and COSMIC were used to compile the initial gene list. We used the PAGER software to expand the gene list based on biological pathways and the BEERE software to construct protein-protein interaction networks that include the gene list to rank order genes. We produced a final gene list for each data modality iteratively from an initial draft gene list, using glioblastoma multiform (GBM) as a case study.\n\nConclusionWe demonstrated that GBM gene lists obtained from three modalities (differential gene expressions, gene mutations, and copy number alterations) and several data sources could be iteratively expanded and ranked using GRIPP. While integrating various modalities of data can be useful to generate an integrated ranked gene list related to any specific disease, the integration may also decrease the overall significance of ranked genes derived from specific data modalities. Therefore, we recommend carefully sorting and integrating gene lists according to each modality, such as gene mutations, epigenetic controls, or differential expressions, to procure modality-specific biological insights into the prioritized genes.",

    "abstract": "TidyGEO is a Web-based tool for downloading, tidying, and reformatting data series from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). As a freely accessible repository with data from over 4 million biological samples across more than 4,000 organisms, GEO provides diverse opportunities for secondary research. Transcriptomic data are most common in GEO, but other measurement types are also prevalent, including DNA methylation levels, genotypes, and chromatin-accessibility profiles. GEOs diversity and expansiveness present opportunities and challenges. Although scientists may find assay data relevant to a given research question, most analyses require sample annotations, such as a samples treatment group, disease subtype, or age. In GEO, such annotations are stored alongside assay data in delimited, text-based files. However, the structure and semantics of the annotations vary widely from one series to another, and many annotations are not useful for analysis purposes. Thus, every GEO series must be tidied before it can be analyzed. Manual approaches may be used, but these are error prone and take time away from other research tasks. Custom computer scripts can be written, but many scientists lack the computational expertise to create such scripts. To address these challenges, we created TidyGEO, which supports essential data-cleaning tasks for sample-level annotations, such as selecting informative columns, renaming columns, splitting or merging columns, standardizing data values, and filtering samples. Additionally, users can integrate annotations with assay data, restructure assay data, and generate code that enables others to reproduce these steps.

    "abstract": "BackgroundAdenosine A1 receptor (A1AR) plays a prominent role in neurological and cardiac diseases as well as during inflammatory processes. Its endogenous ligand adenosine is known to be one of the key players in the sleep-wake cycle. Like other G protein-coupled receptors, stimulation of A1AR leads to the recruitment of arrestins in addition to the activation of G proteins. So far, little is known about the role of these proteins for signal transduction and regulation of A1AR compared to the activation of G proteins. In this work, we characterized a live cell assay for the A1AR mediated {beta}-arrestin 2 recruitment. We have applied this assay to a set of different compounds that interact with this receptor.\n\nMethodsBased on NanoBit(R) technology, a protein complementation assay was developed in which the A1AR is coupled to the large part of the nanoluciferase (LgBiT) whereas its small part (SmBiT) is fused to the N-terminus of {beta}-arrestin 2. Stimulation of A1AR results in the recruitment of {beta}-arrestin 2 and subsequent complementation of a functional nanoluciferase. For comparison, corresponding data on the effect of receptor stimulation on intracellular cAMP levels were collected for some data sets using the GloSensorTM assay.\n\nResultsThe assay gives highly reproducible results with a very good signal to noise ratio. Capadenoson, in contrast to adenosine, CPA or NECA, shows only partial agonism in this assay with respect to the recruitment of {beta}-arrestin 2, whereas it is a full agonist in the case of the inhibitory effect of A1AR on cAMP production. By using a GRK2 inhibitor, it becomes clear that the recruitment is at least partially dependent on the phosphorylation of the receptor by this kinase. Interestingly, this was also the first time that we were able to demonstrate the A1AR mediated recruitment of {beta}-arrestin 2 by stimulation with a valerian extract.\n\nConclusionThe presented assay is a useful tool for the quantitative study of the A1AR mediated {beta}-arrestin 2 recruitment. It allows data collection for stimulatory, inhibitory as well as modulatory substances and is also suitable for more complex substance mixtures such as valerian extract.",

The neuropathology of such UBQLN2-linked cases of ALS/FTD is characterised by aggregates of the ubiquilin 2 protein in addition to aggregates of the transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43). ALS and FTD without UBQLN2 mutations are also characterised by TDP-43 aggregates, that may or may not colocalise with wildtype ubiquilin 2. Despite this, the relative contributions of TDP-43 and ubiquilin 2 to disease pathogenesis remain largely under-characterised, as does their relative deposition as aggregates across the central nervous system (CNS). Here we conducted multiplex immunohistochemistry of three UBQLN2 p.T487I-linked ALS/FTD cases, three non-UBQLN2-linked (sporadic) ALS cases, and eight non-neurodegenerative disease controls, covering 40 CNS regions. We then quantified ubiquilin 2 aggregates, TDP-43 aggregates, and aggregates containing both proteins in regions of interest to determine how UBQLN2-linked and non-UBQLN2-linked proteinopathy differ. We find that ubiquilin 2 aggregates that are negative for TDP-43 are predominantly small and punctate, and are abundant in the hippocampal formation, spinal cord, all tested regions of neocortex, medulla, and substantia nigra in UBQLN2-linked ALS/FTD but not sporadic ALS. Curiously, the striatum harboured small punctate ubiquilin 2 aggregates in all cases examined, while large diffuse striatal ubiquilin 2 aggregates were specific to UBQLN2-linked ALS/FTD. While ubiquilin 2 deposition in frontotemporal regions may enhance cognitive risk in UBQLN2-linked cases, ubiquilin 2 is deposited mainly in clinically unaffected regions throughout the CNS such that overall symptomology in these cases maps best to the aggregation of TDP-43.",

    "abstract": "Although dystonia is the third most common movement disorder, patients often also experience debilitating nonmotor defects including impaired sleep. The cerebellum is a central component of a \"dystonia network\" that plays various roles in sleep regulation. Importantly, the primary driver of sleep impairments in dystonia remains poorly understood. The cerebellum, along with other nodes in the motor circuit, could disrupt sleep. However, it is unclear how the cerebellum might alter sleep and mobility. To disentangle the impact of cerebellar dysfunction on motion and sleep, we generated two mouse genetic models of dystonia that have overlapping cerebellar circuit miswiring but show differing motor phenotype severity: Ptf1aCre;Vglut2fx/fx and Pdx1Cre;Vglut2fx/fx mice. In both models, excitatory climbing fiber to Purkinje cell neurotransmission is blocked, but only the Ptf1aCre;Vglut2fx/fx mice have severe twisting. Using in vivo ECoG and EMG recordings we found that both mutants spend greater time awake and in NREM sleep at the expense of REM sleep. The increase in awake time is driven by longer awake bouts rather than an increase in bout number. We also found a longer latency to reach REM in both mutants, which is similar to what is reported in human dystonia. We uncovered independent but parallel roles for cerebellar circuit dysfunction and motor defects in promoting sleep quality versus posture impairments in dystonia.",

It has been reported that inhibitory interneurons that express neuropeptide Y (NPY), either permanently or during development, suppress mechanical itch, with no effect on pain. Here we investigate the role of interneurons that continue to express NPY (NPY-INs) in adulthood. We find that chemogenetic activation of NPY-INs reduces behaviours associated with acute pain and pruritogen-evoked itch, whereas silencing them causes exaggerated itch responses that depend on cells expressing the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor. As predicted by our previous studies, silencing of another population of inhibitory interneurons (those expressing dynorphin) also increases itch, but to a lesser extent. Importantly, NPY- IN activation also reduces behavioural signs of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. These results demonstrate that NPY-INs gate pain and itch transmission at the spinal level, and therefore represent a potential treatment target for pathological pain and itch.",

One particularly promising approach is the prediction of individual-level behavioural phenotypes (e.g. treatment response, cognition) from brain imaging data. An essential prerequisite to identify replicable brain-behaviour prediction models is sufficient measurement reliability. By attenuating the relationship between two variables, low reliability increases the sample size necessary to identify an effect, making large datasets a necessity rather than an advantage. While previous work has evaluated the reliability of brain-based measures, the impact of the reliability of behavioural phenotypes has been largely neglected, as target selection for prediction is often guided by scientific interest or data availability. Here we demonstrate the impact of low phenotypic reliability on individual-level prediction performance. Using simulated and empirical data from the Human Connectome Projects, we found that even moderate reliability levels of commonly used behavioural phenotypes can markedly limit the ability to link brain and behaviour when underlying relations are weak. Next, using 5000 subjects from the UK Biobank, we show that highly reliable data in smaller samples outperform large amounts of moderately reliable data. These findings suggest that research programmes focused on identifying generalizable brain-behaviour associations must seriously consider the reliability of outcome measures. Ultimately, a stronger focus on reliability will help reduce the financial and societal costs incurred in acquiring large-scale datasets with unreliable \"markers\" of behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Brain Machine Interfaces (BMIs) are systems that can help restore motor function to individuals with paralysis. These systems utilize machine learning algorithms to detect how the user wants to control an assistive device from their brain activity. These algorithms require a training dataset to infer patterns between a users brain waves and the control signal for the assistive device. These training datasets consist of brain activity recordings while participants perform a very repetitive motor task. We hypothesize that these training datasets can be compromised due to the high number of trials. We anticipate that the movement-related brain waves of interest attenuate over time due to neural efficiency, where the brain becomes more efficient with practice in a motor task. To explore this hypothesis, we used an open-access EEG dataset where participants performed a simple reach-and-lift task. From each trial, time windows associated with resting and movement periods were segmented. Alpha and beta-band spectral power was estimated for each of these epochs and event-related desynchronization (ERD) was estimated as the suppression in spectral power from rest to movement. These ERDs were compared between early and late trials in the dataset. We also used linear discriminant analysis to assess a machine learning algorithms accuracy in classifying whether the time windows belonged to rest or movement based on the spectral power band. We found that earlier trials had stronger ERDs and larger classification accuracies, suggesting that the repetition in the motor task causes attenuation of movement-related brain wave patterns and reduces efficacy of the dataset. These results call for a reevaluation of BMI performance in datasets that have numerous trials and an exploration of strategies that can compensate for longitudinal changes in movement-related brain activity used for BMIs.",

    "abstract": "Self antigen-specific T cells are prevalent in the mature adaptive immune system, but are regulated through multiple mechanisms of tolerance. However, inflammatory conditions such as tissue injury may provide these T cells with an opportunity to break tolerance and trigger autoimmunity. To understand how the T cell repertoire responds to the presentation of self antigen under highly stimulatory conditions, we used peptide:MHCII tetramers to track the behavior of endogenous CD4+ T cells with specificity to a lung-expressed self antigen in mouse models of immune-mediated lung injury. Acute injury resulted in the exclusive expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that was dependent on self antigen recognition and IL-2. Conversely, conventional T cells of the same self antigen specificity remained unresponsive, even following Treg ablation. Thus, the self antigen-specific T cell repertoire is poised to serve a regulatory function during acute tissue damage to limit further damage and the possibility of autoimmunity.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer via conjugation plays a major role in bacterial evolution. In F-like plasmids, efficient DNA transfer is mediated by close association between donor and recipient bacteria. This process, known as mating pair stabilization (MPS), is mediated by interactions between the plasmid-encoded outer membrane (OM) protein TraN in the donor and chromosomally-encoded OM proteins in the recipient. We have recently reported the existence of seven TraN sequence types, which are grouped into four structural types, we named TraN, TraN{beta}, TraN{gamma}, TraN{delta}. Moreover, we have shown specific pairing between TraN and OmpW, TraN{beta} and OmpK36 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, TraN{gamma} and OmpA and TraN{delta} and OmpF. In this study we found that although structurally similar, TraN encoded by the pSLT plasmid (TraN2) binds OmpW in both Escherichia coli and Citrobacter rodentium while TraN encoded by the R100-1 plasmid (TraN1) only binds OmpW in E. coli. AlphaFold2 predictions suggested that this specificity is mediated by a single amino acid difference in loop 3 of OmpW, which we confirmed experimentally. Moreover, we show that single amino acids insertions into loop 3 of OmpK36 affect TraN{beta}-mediated conjugation efficiency of the K. pneumoniae resistance plasmid pKpQIL. Lastly, we report that TraN{beta} can also mediate MPS by binding OmpK35, making it the first TraN variant that can bind more than one OM protein in the recipient. Together, these data show that subtle sequence differences in the OM receptors can impact TraN-mediated conjugation efficiency.\n\nImportanceConjugation plays a central role in the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes amongst bacterial pathogens. Efficient conjugation is mediated by formation of mating pairs via a pilus, followed by mating pair stabilisation (MPS), mediated by tight interactions between the plasmid encoded outer membrane protein (OMP) TraN in the donor (of which there are seven sequence types grouped into the four structural isoforms , {beta}, {gamma}, {delta}) and an OMP receptor in the recipient (OmpW, OmpK36, OmpA and OmpF, respectively). In this study we found that subtle differences in OmpW and OmpK36 have significant consequences on conjugation efficiency and specificity, highlighting the existence of selective pressure affecting plasmid-host compatibility and the flow of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are ubiquitous two-gene loci that bacteria use to regulate cellular processes such as phage defense. Here, we demonstrate the mechanism by which a novel type III TA system, avcID, is activated and confers resistance to phage infection. The toxin of the system (AvcD) is a deoxycytidylate deaminase that converts deoxycytidines (dC) to dexoyuridines (dU), while the RNA antitoxin (AvcI) inhibits AvcD activity. We have shown that AvcD deaminated dC nucleotides upon phage infection, but the molecular mechanism that activated AvcD was unknown. Here we show that the activation of AvcD arises from phage-induced shutoff of host transcription, leading to degradation of the labile AvcI. AvcD activation and nucleotide depletion not only decreases phage replication but also increases the formation of defective phage virions. Surprisingly, infection of phages such as T7 that are not inhibited by AvcID also lead to AvcI RNA antitoxin degradation and AvcD activation, suggesting that depletion of AvcI is not sufficient to confer protection against some phage. Rather, our results support that phage with a longer lysis time like T5 are sensitive to AvcID-mediated protection while those with a shorter lysis time like T7 are resistant.\n\nAUTHORS SUMMARYNumerous diverse antiphage defense systems have been discovered in the past several years, but the mechanisms of how these systems are activated upon phage infection and why these systems protect against some phage but not others are poorly understood. The AvcID toxin-antitoxin phage defense system depletes nucleotides of the dC pool inside the host upon phage infection. We show that phage inhibition of host cell transcription activates this system by depleting the AvcI inhibitory sRNA, which inhibits production of phage and leads to the formation of defective virions. Additionally, we determined that phage lysis time is a key factor that influences sensitivity to AvcID with faster replicating phage exhibiting resistance to its effects. This study has implications for understanding the factors that influence bacterial host/phage dynamics.",

    "abstract": "SMAUG1 is a human RNA-binding protein that is known to be dysregulated in a wide range of diseases. It is evolutionarily conserved and has been shown to form condensates containing translationally repressed RNAs. This indicates that condensation is central to proper SMAUG1 function; however, the factors governing condensation are largely unknown. In this work, we show that SMAUG1 drives the formation of liquid-like condensates in cells through its non-conventional C-terminal prion-like disordered region. We use biochemical assays to show that this liquid-liquid phase separation is independent of RNA binding and does not depend on other large, disordered regions that potentially harbor several binding sites for partner proteins. Using a combination of computational predictions, structural modeling, in vitro and in cell measurements, we also show that SMAUG1-driven condensation is negatively regulated by direct interactions with members of the 14-3-3 protein family. These interactions are mediated by four distinct phospho-regulated short linear motifs embedded in the disordered regions of SMAUG1, working synergistically. Interactions between SMAUG1 and 14-3-3 proteins drive the dissolution of condensates, alter the dynamics of the condensed state, and are likely to be intertwined with currently unknown regulatory mechanisms. Our results provide information on how SMAUG1 phase separation is regulated and the first known instance of 14-3-3 proteins being able to completely dissolve condensates by directly interacting with a phase separation driver, which might be a general mechanism in cells to regulate biological condensation.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=96 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/527857v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@868746org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b3318org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b78868org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5c7e5e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LISMAUG1 is a human RNA-binding protein capable of condensation with unknown regulation\nC_LIO_LIA prion-like domain of SMAUG1 drives condensation via liquid-liquid phase separation\nC_LIO_LISMAUG1 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins via four phospho-regulated short linear motifs\nC_LIO_LI14-3-3 interactions change the dynamics of SMAUG1 condensates, promoting their dissolution\nC_LIO_LIThis is the first described regulatory mechanism for SMAUG1-driven condensation\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A genetic bottleneck is a hallmark of HIV-1 transmission such that only very few viral strains, termed transmitted/founder (T/F) variants establish infection in a newly infected host. Phenotypic characteristics of these variants may determine the subsequent course of disease. The HIV-1 5 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter drives viral gene transcription and is genetically identical to the 3 LTR. We hypothesized that HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C) T/F virus LTR genetic variation is a determinant of transcriptional activation potential and clinical disease outcome. The 3LTR was amplified from plasma samples of 41 study participants acutely infected with HIV-1C (Fiebig stages I and V/VI). Paired longitudinal samples were also available at one year post-infection for 31 of the 41 participants. 3 LTR amplicons were cloned into a pGL3-basic luciferase expression vector, and transfected alone or together with Transactivator of transcription (tat) into Jurkat cells in the absence or presence of cell activators (TNF-, PMA, Prostratin and SAHA). Inter-patient T/F LTR sequence diversity was 5.7% with subsequent intrahost viral evolution observed in 48.4% of the participants analyzed at 12 months post-infection. T/F LTR variants exhibited differential basal transcriptional activity, with significantly higher Tat-mediated transcriptional activity compared to basal (p<0.001). Basal and Tat-mediated T/F LTR transcriptional activity showed significant positive correlation with contemporaneous viral loads and negative correlation with CD4 T cell counts (p<0.05) during acute infection respectively. Furthermore, Tat-mediated T/F LTR transcriptional activity significanly correlated positively with viral load set point and viral load; and negatively with CD4 T cell counts at one year post infection (all p<0.05). Lastly, PMA, Prostratin, TNF- and SAHA cell stimulation resulted in enhanced yet heterologous transcriptional activation of different T/F LTR variants. Our data suggest that T/F LTR variants may influence viral transcriptional activity, disease outcomes and sensitivity to cell activation, with potentional implications for therapeutic interventions.\n\nAuthor summaryThere is heterogeneity in the rates of clinical disease progression in antiretroval therapy-naive people living with HIV (PLWH). In heterosexual HIV-1 transmission, only a single or very few viral strains, called transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses establish infection in a newly infected host. The long terminal repeat (LTR) is the viral promoter that drives viral gene transcription and is important for the HIV-1 life cycle. In this study we investigated the impact of HIV-1 subtype C T/F virus LTR genetic variation on transcriptional activity, clinical disease outcomes and response to cell activation. Our data show inter-patient T/F LTR genetic variation and limited intrahost evolution by 12 months post infection. T/F LTR variants exhibit differential basal LTR transcriptional activity, which is significanly increased in the presence of the Transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein. Furthermore, we show that T/F LTR transcription activity significanly correlates positively with viral load and viral load set point but negatively with CD4 T cell count. Lastly, we show that T/F LTR variants exhibit differential responses to cell activators PMA, TNF-, Prostratin and SAHA. Taken together our data suggest that T/F viruses LTR genetic variation and functional heterogeneity are important determinants of clinical outcomes and virus reactivation potential.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic comparative methods are increasingly used to test hypotheses about the evolutionary processes that drive divergence in gene expression among species. However, it is unknown whether the distributional assumptions of phylogenetic models designed for quantitative phenotypic traits are realistic for expression data and importantly, the reliability of conclusions of phylogenetic comparative studies of gene expression may depend on whether the data is well-described by the chosen model. To evaluate this, we first fit several phylogenetic models of trait evolution to 8 previously published comparative expression datasets, comprising a total of 54,774 genes with 145,927 unique gene-tissue combinations. Using a previously developed approach, we then assessed how well the best model of the set described the data in an absolute (not just relative) sense. First, we find that Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models, in which expression values are constrained around an optimum, were the preferred model for 66% of gene-tissue combinations. Second, we find that for 61% of gene-tissue combinations, the best fit model of the set was found to perform well; the rest were found to be performing poorly by at least one of the test statistics we examined. Third, we find that when simple models do not perform well, this appears to be typically a consequence of failing to fully account for heterogeneity in the rate of the evolution. We advocate that assessment of model performance should become a routine component of phylogenetic comparative expression studies; doing so can improve the reliability of inferences and inspire the development of novel models.",

Spine evolution is closely related to radiation of extant ungulates and extinct ground sloths, rather than climate variation. Diversification began in the Paleogene in herbivore species-rich Eurasia and North America, emerging later in the Neogene in species-poorer South America, Africa and Australia. Spiny lineages expanded their ecological footprint over non-spiny plants, mainly through intercontinental migrations, indicating that spines likely provided a competitive advantage with increasing, and novel, mammal herbivory pressure.",

However, existing tools lack the throughput required for comprehensive analysis of complex tumors and tissues. We introduce a highly scalable method for jointly profiling DNA and expression following nucleosome depletion (DEFND-seq). In DEFND-seq, nuclei are nucleosome-depleted, tagmented, and separated into individual droplets for mRNA and genomic DNA barcoding. Once nuclei have been depleted of nucleosomes, subsequent steps can be performed using the widely available 10x Genomics droplet microfluidic technology and commercial kits without experimental modification. We demonstrate the production of high-complexity mRNA and gDNA sequencing libraries from thousands of individual nuclei from both cell lines and archived surgical specimens for associating gene expression phenotypes with both copy number and single nucleotide variants.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 interferes with antigen presentation by downregulating MHC II on antigen presenting cells, but the mechanism mediating this process is unelucidated. Herein, analysis of protein and gene expression in human antigen presenting cells reveals that MHC II is downregulated by the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, NSP5. This suppression of MHC II expression occurs via decreased expression of the MHC II regulatory protein CIITA. This downregulation of CIITA is independent of NSP5s proteolytic activity, and rather, NSP5 delivers HDAC2 to the CIITA promoter via an IRF3-dependent mechanism. Here, HDAC2 deacetylates and inactivates the CIITA promoter. This loss of CIITA expression prevents further expression of MHC II, with this suppression alleviated by ectopic expression of CIITA or knockdown of HDAC2. These results identify a mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 can limit MHC II expression, thereby delaying or weakening the subsequent adaptive immune response.",

    "abstract": "Long COVID (LC), a type of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), occurs after at least 10% of SARS-CoV-2 infections, yet its etiology remains poorly understood. Here, we used multiple \"omics\" assays (CyTOF, RNAseq/scRNAseq, Olink) and serology to deeply characterize both global and SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity from blood of individuals with clear LC and non-LC clinical trajectories, 8 months following infection and prior to receipt of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Our analysis focused on deep phenotyping of T cells, which play important roles in immunity against SARS-CoV-2 yet may also contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that individuals with LC exhibit systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation. This is evidenced by global differences in T cell subset distribution in ways that imply ongoing immune responses, as well as by sex-specific perturbations in cytolytic subsets. Individuals with LC harbored increased frequencies of CD4+ T cells poised to migrate to inflamed tissues, and exhausted SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells. They also harbored significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and in contrast to non-LC individuals, exhibited a mis-coordination between their SARS-CoV-2-specific T and B cell responses. RNAseq/scRNAseq and Olink analyses similarly revealed immune dysregulatory mechanisms, along with non-immune associated perturbations, in individuals with LC. Collectively, our data suggest that proper crosstalk between the humoral and cellular arms of adaptive immunity has broken down in LC, and that this, perhaps in the context of persistent virus, leads to the immune dysregulation, inflammation, and clinical symptoms associated with this debilitating condition.",

    "abstract": "Analyses of the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 found that some sites across the genome appear to have mutated independently multiple times with frequency significantly higher than four-fold sites, which can be either due to mutational bias, i.e., elevated mutation rate in some sites of the genome, or selection of the variants due to antagonistic pleiotropy, a condition where mutations increase some components of fitness at a cost to others. To examine how different forces shaped evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020-2021, we analyzed a large set of genome sequences (~ 2 million). Here we show that while evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic was largely mutation-driven, a group of nonsynonymous changes is probably maintained by antagonistic pleiotropy. To test this hypothesis, we studied the function of one such mutation, spike M1237I. Spike I1237 increases viral assembly and secretion, but decreases efficiency of transmission in vitro. Therefore, while the frequency of spike M1237I may increase within hosts, viruses carrying this mutation would be outcompeted at the population level. We also discuss how the antagonistic pleiotropy might facilitate positive epistasis to promote virus adaptation and reconcile discordant estimates of SARS-CoV-2 transmission bottleneck sizes in previous studies.",

However, the conserved s2m in Delta SARS-CoV-2, a previously dominant variant characterized by high infectivity and disease severity, has received relatively less attention than that of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus. The focus of this work is to identify and define the s2m changes between Delta and SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent impact of those changes upon the s2m dimerization and interactions with the host microRNA miR-1307-3p. Bioinformatics analysis of the GISAID database targeting the s2m element reveals a greater than 99% correlation of a single nucleotide mutation at the 15th position (G15U) in Delta SARS-CoV-2. Based on 1H NMR assignments comparing the imino proton resonance region of s2m and the G15U at 19{degrees}C, we find that the U15-A29 base pair closes resulting in a stabilization of the upper stem without overall secondary structure deviation. Increased stability of the upper stem did not affect the chaperone activity of the viral N protein, as it was still able to convert the kissing dimers formed by s2m G15U into a stable duplex conformation, consistent with the s2m reference. However, we find that the s2m G15U mutation drastically reduces the binding affinity of the host miR-1307-3p. These findings demonstrate that the observed G15U mutation alters the secondary structure of s2m with subsequent impact on viral binding of host miR-1307-3p, with potential consequences on the immune response.",

In this study, we use a population genetic approach to examine the evolution of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in four provinces of South Africa (Eastern Cape, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, and Mpumalanga) during the first months before emergence and after early spread. Our results show that Omicron polymorphisms increase sharply from September to November. We found differences between SARS-CoV-2 populations from Gauteng and Kwazulu-Natal and viruses from the Eastern Cape, where allele frequencies were higher, suggesting that natural selection may have contributed to the increase in frequency or that this was the site of origin. We found that the frequency of variants N501Y, T478K, and D614G increased in the spike in November compared with other mutations, some of which are also present in other animal hosts. Gauteng province was the most isolated, and most genetic variation was found within populations. Our population genomic approach is useful for small-scale genomic surveillance and identification of novel allele-level variants that can help us understand how SARS-CoV-2 will continue to adapt to humans and other hosts.",

    "abstract": "Cell-free gene expression (CFE) systems are powerful tools for transcribing and translating genes outside of a living cell. Given their diverse roles in nature, synthesis of membrane proteins is of particular interest, but their yield in CFE is substantially lower than for soluble protein. In this paper, we study factors that affect the cell-free synthesis of membrane proteins and develop a quantitative kinetic model of their production. We identify that stalling of membrane protein translation on the ribosome is a strong predictor of membrane protein synthesis and creates a negative feedback loop in which stalled peptide sequences quench ribosome activity through aggregation between the ribosome nascent chains. Synthesis can be improved by the addition of lipid membranes which incorporate protein nascent chains and, therefore, kinetically competes with aggregation. Using both quantitative modeling and experiment, we show that the balance between peptide-membrane association and peptide aggregation rates determines the total yield of synthesized membrane protein. We then demonstrate that this balance can be shifted by altering membrane composition or the protein N-terminal domain sequence. Based on these findings, we define a membrane protein expression score that can be used to rationalize the engineering of N-terminal domain sequences both of a native and computationally designed membrane proteins produced through CFE.",

    "abstract": "Cell-free protein expression has become a widely used research tool in systems and synthetic biology and a promising technology for protein biomanufacturing. Cell-free protein synthesis relies on in-vitro transcription and translation processes to produce a protein of interest. However, transcription and translation depend upon the operation of complex metabolic pathways for precursor and energy regeneration. Toward understanding the role of metabolism in a cell-free system, we developed a dynamic constraint-based simulation of protein production in the myTXTL E. coli cell-free system with and without electron transport chain inhibitors. Time-resolved absolute metabolite measurements for [M] = 63 metabolites, along with absolute concentration measurements of the mRNA and protein abundance and measurements of enzyme activity, were integrated with kinetic and enzyme abundance information to simulate the time evolution of metabolic flux and protein production with and without inhibitors. The metabolic flux distribution estimated by the model, along with the experimental metabolite and enzyme activity data, suggested that the myTXTL cell-free system has an active central carbon metabolism with glutamate powering the TCA cycle. Further, the electron transport chain inhibitor studies suggested the presence of oxidative phosphorylation activity in the myTXTL cell-free system; the oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors provided biochemical evidence that myTXTL relied, at least partially, on oxidative phosphorylation to generate the energy required to sustain transcription and translation for a 16-hour batch reaction.",

Schistosome infection impaired bone marrow HSC function after serial transplantation. Functional HSCs were present in the infected liver. Infection blocked bone marrow erythropoiesis and augmented spleen erythropoiesis, observations consistent with the anemia and splenomegaly prevalent in schistosomiasis patients.

    "abstract": "Over two decades, epidemiological studies have revealed that interactions between human polymorphic apolipoprotein 4 (ApoE, isoform 4) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) associate with higher risk of Alzheimers disease, a serious and increasing issue among elder populations worldwide. Nevertheless, little is known about the mechanisms behind ApoE-HSV1 interactions at molecular levels. Here, we investigate the effects of ApoE on the HSV1 infectious life cycle in in vitro cell experiments. Analysis of HSV1 growth curves shows that HSV1 production is promoted in presence of any of the three ApoE isoforms, with ApoE 3or 4 demonstrating more efficient pro-viral effects than ApoE 2. When added prior to infection, ApoE inhibits viral attachment but does not affect viral entry. qPCR-based quantification reveals that harbouring ApoE 2, 3, or 4 leads to an increase of HSV1 extracellular release but unchanged levels of viral genome copies within cells or on the cell surface, indicating that virus replication, assembly, or transport to cell membrane are not affected. Further test of virus release directly demonstrates that HSV1 detachment from the cell surface is promoted by ApoE. Subsequent results reveal that ApoE is not only present in purified HSV1 particles produced in ApoE-expressing cells after ultra-centrifugation but also able to incorporate into HSV1 particles after purification, suggesting that harbouring ApoE may promote HSV1 detachment. With the help of total internal reflection microscopy (TIRFM), this hypothesis was tested by quantifying interaction kinetics and apparent affinity between of HSV1 and native supported lipid bilayer. HSV1 particle decorated with ApoE demonstrates higher dissociation rate constants (koff) and less irreversible binding to the membrane, which is in line with the promoted virus release. Similar interaction kinetics have also been tested between non-decorated HSV1 particles and membranes harbouring ApoE but revealed no difference in the kinetics of virus particles on membranes with ApoE present or absent. Overall, our results provide new insights into the roles of ApoE during HSV1 infections, which is worth to be considered when studying their involvement during AD development.",

    "abstract": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), a devastating form of stroke, is a leading global cause of human death and disability. The major risk factors for ICH include increasing age, hypertension and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Despite high mortality and morbidity associated with ICH, the mechanisms leading to blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction with age and development of hemorrhagic stroke is poorly understood. In the vasculature of the central nervous system, endothelial cells (ECs) constitute the core component of the BBB and provide a physical barrier due to tight junctions, adherens junctions, and basement membrane layers. In this study, we show in brains of mice that incidents of intracerebral bleeding increase with advancing age. After isolation of an enriched population of cerebral ECs, we studied gene expression in ECs isolated from murine brains of increasing ages of 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The study reveals agedependent dysregulation of 1388 genes in the ECs, including many involved in the maintenance of BBB and vascular integrity. Since epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene expression, we also investigated age-dependent changes at the levels of CpG methylation and accessible chromatin in cerebral ECs. Our study reveals correlations between age-dependent changes in chromatin structure and gene expression. We find significant age-dependent downregulation of the apelin receptor (Aplnr) gene along with an age-dependent reduction in chromatin accessibility of the promoter of this gene. Aplnr is known to play a crucial role in positive regulation of vasodilation and is implicated in vascular health. Interestingly, we also observe an age-dependent reduction in the protein expression levels of the apelin receptor in the brain, potentially implicating the apelin receptor to be critical for the increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage with ageing.",

    "abstract": "Since the first identification of circular RNA (circRNA) in viral-like systems, reports of circRNAs and their functions in various organisms, cell types, and organelles have greatly expanded. Here, we report the first evidence of circular mRNA in the mitochondrion of the eukaryotic parasite, Trypanosoma brucei. While using a circular RT-PCR technique developed to sequence mRNA tails of mitochondrial transcripts, we found that some mRNAs are circularized without an in vitro circularization step normally required to produce PCR products. Starting from total in vitro circularized RNA and in vivo circRNA, we high-throughput sequenced three transcripts from the 3 end of the coding region, through the 3 tail, to the 5 start of the coding region. We found that fewer reads in the circRNA libraries contained tails than in the total RNA libraries. When tails were present on circRNAs, they were shorter and less adenine-rich than the total population of RNA tails of the same transcript. Additionally, using hidden Markov modelling we determined that enzymatic activity during tail addition is different for circRNAs than for total RNA. Lastly, circRNA UTRs tended to be shorter and more variable than those of the same transcript sequenced from total RNA. We propose a revised model of Trypanosome mitochondrial tail addition, in which a fraction of mRNAs is circularized prior to the addition of adenine-rich tails and may act as a new regulatory molecule or in a degradation pathway.",

    "abstract": "The cellular lipidome is comprised of thousands of unique lipid species. This complexity underpins the many roles of lipids in cellular biology. How lipidome composition varies between cell types and how such differences contribute to cell-specific functionality is poorly understood. Here, using mass spectrometry-based targeted lipidomics, we have characterised the cellular lipid landscape of the human and mouse immune systems (www.cellularlipidatlas.com). We find that myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages have unique lipid compositions, notably in the usage of ester and ether bonds within glycerophospholipids (PLs) and PL acyl chain composition. To determine if immune cell-specific lipid phenotypes promote cell-specific functional properties we focused on differences in poly-unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-containing PL, the levels of which are markedly higher in lymphoid cells relative to myeloid cells. We firstly show that differences in PUFA-PL content provides a mechanistic basis for previously described differences in immune cell susceptibility to ferroptosis, a form of cell death driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, and secondly, that the low PUFA-PL content of neutrophils restrains NADPH oxidase-driven ferroptosis. In summary, we show that the lipid landscape is a defining feature of immune cell identity and that cell-specific lipid phenotypes underpin aspects of immune cell physiology.",

    "abstract": "Findings from genome-wide association studies have facilitated the generation of genetic predictors for many common human phenotypes. Stratifying individuals misaligned to a genetic predictor based on common variants may be important for follow-up studies that aim to identify alternative causal factors. Using genome-wide imputed genetic data, we aimed to classify 158,951 unrelated individuals from the UK Biobank as either concordant or deviating from two well-measured phenotypes. We first applied our methods to standing height: our primary analysis classified 244 individuals (0.15%) as misaligned to their genetically predicted height. We show that these individuals are enriched for self-reporting being shorter or taller than average at age 10, diagnosed congenital malformations, and rare loss-of-function variants in genes previously catalogued as causal for growth disorders. Secondly, we apply our methods to LDL cholesterol. We classified 156 (0.12%) individuals as misaligned to their genetically predicted LDL cholesterol and show that these individuals were enriched for both clinically actionable cardiovascular risk factors and rare genetic variants in genes previously shown to be involved in metabolic processes. Individuals whose LDL-C was higher than expected based on the genetic predictor were also at higher risk of developing coronary artery disease and type-two diabetes, even after adjustment for measured LDL-C, BMI and age, suggesting upward deviation from genetically predicted LDL-C is indicative of generally poor health. Our results remained broadly consistent when performing sensitivity analysis based on a variety of parametric and non-parametric methods to define individuals deviating from polygenic expectation. Our analyses demonstrate the potential importance of quantitatively identifying individuals for further follow-up based on deviation from genetic predictions.\n\nAuthor SummaryHuman genetics is becoming increasingly useful to help predict human traits across a population owing to findings from large-scale genetic association studies and advances in the power of genetic predictors. This provides an opportunity to potentially identify individuals that deviate from genetic predictions for a common phenotype under investigation. For example, an individual may be genetically predicted to be tall, but be shorter than expected. It is potentially important to identify individuals who deviate from genetic predictions as this can facilitate further follow-up to assess likely causes. Using 158,951 unrelated individuals from the UK Biobank, with height and LDL cholesterol, as exemplar traits, we demonstrate that approximately 0.15% & 0.12% of individuals deviate from their genetically predicted phenotypes respectively. We observed these individuals to be enriched for a range of rare clinical diagnoses, as well as rare genetic factors that may be causal. Our analyses also demonstrate several methods for detecting individuals who deviate from genetic predictions that can be applied to a range of continuous human phenotypes.",

In this work, we determined the symmetry and architecture of -synuclein oligomers, dissecting the conformational properties of individual chains within these toxic assemblies. We demonstrate that the NAC domain is insufficient to promote oligomer to fibril conversion; instead, this transition is controlled by a short -synuclein N-terminal motif. A missense mutation causing early-onset Parkinsons disease remodels this N-terminal region conformation, which results in a population of long-lived oligomers less susceptible to disaggregation by the human Hsp70 machinery.

    "abstract": "DNA transcription initiates after an RNA polymerase (RNAP) molecule binds to the promoter of a gene. In bacteria, the canonical picture is that RNAP comes from the cytoplasmic pool of freely diffusing RNAP molecules. Recent experiments suggest the possible existence of a separate pool of polymerases, competent for initiation, which freely slide on the DNA after having terminated one round of transcription. Promoter-dependent transcription reinitiation from this pool of post-termination RNAP may lead to coupled initiation at nearby operons, but it is unclear whether this can occur over the distance- and time-scales needed for it to function widely on a bacterial genome in vivo. Here, we mathematically model the hypothesized reinitiation mechanism as a diffusion-to-capture process and compute the distances over which significant inter-operon coupling can occur and the time required. These quantities depend on previously uncharacterized molecular association and dissociation rate constants between DNA, RNAP and the transcription initiation factor{sigma} 70; we measure these rate constants using single-molecule experiments in vitro. Our combined theory/experimental results demonstrate that efficient coupling can occur at physiologically relevant{sigma} 70 concentrations and on timescales appropriate for transcript synthesis. Coupling is efficient over terminator-promoter distances up to [~] 1, 000 bp, which includes the majority of terminator-promoter nearest neighbor pairs in the E. coli genome. The results suggest a generalized mechanism that couples the transcription of nearby operons and breaks the paradigm that each binding of RNAP to DNA can produce at most one messenger RNA.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAfter transcribing an operon, a bacterial RNA polymerase can stay bound to DNA, slide along it, and reini-tiate transcription of the same or a different operon. Quantitative single-molecule biophysics experiments combined with mathematical theory demonstrate that this reinitiation process can be quick and efficient over gene spacings typical of a bacterial genome. Reinitiation may provide a mechanism to orchestrate the transcriptional activities of groups of nearby operons.",

    "abstract": "Cell plasticity sustains intra-tumor heterogeneity and treatment resistance in melanoma. Deciphering the transcriptional mechanisms governing reversible phenotypic transitions between proliferative/differentiated and invasive/stem-like states is required in order to design novel therapeutic strategies. EMT-inducing transcription factors, extensively known for their role in metastasis in carcinoma, display cell-type specific functions in melanoma, with a decreased ZEB2/ZEB1 expression ratio fostering adaptive resistance to targeted therapies. While ZEB1 direct target genes have been well characterized in carcinoma models, they remain unknown in melanoma. Here, we performed a genome-wide characterization of ZEB1 transcriptional targets, by combining ChIP-sequencing and RNA-sequencing, upon phenotype switching in melanoma models. We identified and validated ZEB1 binding peaks in the promoter of key lineage-specific genes related to melanoma cell identity. Comparative analyses with breast carcinoma cells demonstrated melanoma-specific ZEB1 binding, further supporting lineage specificity. Gain- or loss-of-function of ZEB1, combined with functional analyses, further demonstrated that ZEB1 negatively regulates proliferative/melanocytic programs and positively regulates both invasive and stem-like programs. We then developed single-cell spatial multiplexed analyses to characterize melanoma cell states with respect to ZEB1/ZEB2 expression in human melanoma samples. We characterized the intra-tumoral heterogeneity of ZEB1 and ZEB2 and further validated ZEB1 increased expression in invasive cells, but also in stem-like cells, highlighting its relevance in vivo in both populations. Overall, our results define ZEB1 as a major transcriptional regulator of cell states transitions and provide a better understanding of lineage-specific transcriptional programs sustaining intra-tumor heterogeneity in melanoma.\n\nstatement of significanceWe identify a ZEB1-driven, lineage-specific transcriptional program governing cell states transitions in melanoma, driving the emergence of invasive and stem-like states, and demonstrate its relevance in sustaining intra-tumor heterogeneity in human samples.",

    "abstract": "Biological mechanisms that rely on signal integration and processing are fundamental for cell function. These types of capabilities are analogous to those found in electronic circuits where individual components perform operations on input signals. In electronics, bandpass filters are crucial components to narrow frequencies within a specified range and reject frequencies outside of that range. However, no generalizable protein-based components are currently available to mimic such processes in engineered biological systems, representing an unmet need in controllable modules. Here, we propose a rational design approach to create protein-based chemically responsive bandpass filters (CBP) which pass chemical concentrations within a range and reject concentrations outside of that range, showing an OFF-ON-OFF regulatory pattern. The CBPs were designed using structure-based approaches where we created a heterodimeric construct which the assembly is triggered by low concentration of a small-molecule, and this interaction is inhibited at high concentrations of the drug, effectively creating a bandpass filter. The CBPs have a multidomain architecture where we used known drug-receptors, a computationally designed protein binder and small-molecule inhibitors. Owing to the modularity of the system, each domain of the CBPs can be rationally fine-tuned to optimize its performance, including bandwidth, maximum response, cutoff concentration and fold changes. These CBPs were used to regulate cell surface receptor signaling pathways showing the capability to control cellular activities in engineered cells.",

Here, we apply retrospective clone tracing to identify and characterize the individual human fibroblast cells that are primed for reprogramming. These fibroblasts showed markers of increased cell cycle speed and decreased fibroblast activation. Knockdown of a fibroblast activation factor identified by our analysis led to increased reprogramming efficiency, identifying it as a barrier to reprogramming.

The intensification of swine production, along with global trade, has amplified the transmission and zoonotic risk of swine influenza virus (swIAV). Effective surveillance is essential to uncover emerging virus strains, however gaps remain in our understanding of the swIAV genomic landscape in Southeast Asia. By collecting more than 4,000 nasal swabs and 4,000 sera from pigs in Cambodia, we unmasked the co-circulation of multiple lineages of genetically diverse swIAV of pandemic concern. Genomic analyses revealed a novel European avian-like H1N2 swine reassortant variant with North American triple reassortant internal genes, that emerged approximately seven years before its first detection in pigs in 2021. Using phylogeographic reconstruction, we identified south central China as the dominant source of swine viruses disseminated to other regions in China and Southeast Asia. We also identified nine distinct swIAV lineages in Cambodia, which diverged from their closest ancestors between two to 15 years ago, indicating significant undetected diversity in the region, including reverse zoonoses of human H1N1/2009 pandemic and H3N2 viruses. A similar period of cryptic circulation of swIAVs occurred in the decades before the H1N1/2009 pandemic. The hidden diversity of swIAV observed here further emphasizes the complex underlying evolutionary processes present in this region, reinforcing the importance of genomic surveillance at the human-swine interface for early warning of disease emergence to avoid future pandemics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBioinoculation improves nutrient access and increases plant resistance to pathogens, thus facilitating higher crop yields under environmental stress. Next generation inoculants (NGIs) consisting of microbial communities instead of strains may be of broader use than standard ones, as different plants might recruit specific organisms from a large pool. Inoculation influences rhizosphere and endophytic community structure modifying community assembly process, which is driven by selection due to the host and by microbe-microbe interactions. Plant colonization by microbes is an instance of succession, with its distinct phases differing in community structure and diversity. This process needs to be studied to determine the optimal timing for bioinoculation and studying its effects. We wanted to learn if, and if so, when stable bacterial communities form during axenic beet plants colonization by bacteria from soil, either inoculated with NGI or non-inoculated and if this process depends on beet genotype and soil.\n\nResultsHere we show that regardless of bioinoculation, soil type and plant genotype bacteria colonize axenic beets rhizosphere and tissues in two phases differing in bacterial load, degree of nestedness, community structure and diversity and aligned with taproot development. Both rhizosphere and endosphere communities remain stable after five weeks of growth in soil. Alpha-diversity was higher and bacterial load was lower in late samples than in early ones. Communities were more similar at the level of predicted functional potential than at the level of ASVs. Time, soil type and genotype determined community structure but not alpha-diversity, bacterial load or nestedness both in rhizosphere and in endosphere. Inoculation slightly but significantly changed community structure both in rhizosphere as well as in roots and leaves. Pseudomonadota and Bacillota of low abundance coming from the NGI were found to be recruited by beets.\n\nConclusionsAxenic beets colonization runs through phases similar to those in other instances of microbial succession and random organisms are recruited. Transition from the early to late phase involves culling of a majority of bacterial cells from plant tissues, apparently on random basis. Five weeks of growth in soil enable formation of stable bacterial communities both in rhizosphere and endosphere. Inoculation only slightly influences bacterial communities and the influence seems to be mostly indirect, probably due to microbe-microbe interactions.",

Interdigitating cellular processes of podocytes form the slits for fluid filtration.

Using high-resolution microscopy, we show that filtration-slit-generating secondary processes preferentially align along the capillaries longitudinal axis while primary processes are preferably perpendicular to the longitudinal direction. The preferential orientation requires maturation in development and is lost in disease states. We demonstrate that loss of proper orientation might contribute to impaired filtration by collapsing of the filtration slits and reducing the mechanical stability of podocyte processes. Together, these data suggest that podocytes sense mechanical strain to utilize circumferential hoop stress balancing the massive mechanical strain generated from fluid flow over the filtration slit.",

    "abstract": "While wastewater is understood to be a critically important reservoir of antimicrobial resistance due to the presence of multiple antibiotic residues from industrial and agricultural runoff, there is little known about the effects of antibiotic interactions in the wastewater on the development of resistance. We worked to fill this gap in quantitative understanding of antibiotic interaction in constant flow environments by experimentally monitoring E. coli populations under subinhibitory concentrations of combinations of antibiotics with synergistic, antagonistic, and additive interactions. We then used these results to expand our previously developed computational model to account for the complex effects of antibiotic interaction. We found that while E. coli populations grown in additively interacting antibiotic combinations grew predictably according to the previously developed model, those populations grown under synergistic and antagonistic antibiotic conditions exhibited significant differences from predicted behavior. E. coli populations grown in the condition with synergistically interacting antibiotics developed less resistance than predicted, indicating that synergistic antibiotics may have a suppressive effect on antimicrobial resistance development. Furthermore E. coli populations grown in the condition with antagonistically interacting antibiotics showed an antibiotic ratio-dependent development of resistance, suggesting that not only antibiotic interaction, but relative concentration is important in predicting resistance development. These results provide critical insight for quantitatively understanding the effects of antibiotic interactions in wastewater and provide a basis for future studies in modelling resistance in these environments.\n\nImportanceAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global threat to public health expected to impact 10 million people by 2050, driving mortality rates globally and with a disproportionate effect on low- and middle-income countries. Communities in proximity to wastewater settings and environmentally contaminated surroundings are at particular risk due to resistance stemming from antibiotic residues from industrial and agricultural runoff. Currently, there is a limited quantitative and mechanistic understanding of the evolution of AMR in response to multiple interacting antibiotic residues in constant flow environments. Using an integrated computational and experimental methods, we find that interactions between antibiotic residues significantly affect the development of resistant bacterial populations.",

    "abstract": "The second law of thermodynamics explains the dissipative nature of embryonic development as an exchange of energy-dependent order for proportionately greater output of heat and waste. Recent work on granular matter provides a path by which to define the roles of passive, stochastic mechanisms in nonequilibrium systems. Here, we apply such a framework to examine the role of thermodynamic parameters to cell ingression, the movement of cells from one tissue layer to another that has been attributed, in part, to directional cues. Using the murine neural crest as a model system, we provide evidence that a stochastic mechanism, rather than a proposed stiffness gradient, underlies cell ingression. Cortical fluctuations representing effective temperature and cell packing configurations generate an entropic trap that promotes cell ingression. The results imply dissipative mechanisms that transiently disorder tissue underlie some morphogenetic events.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, survival rates for extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGANs; <28 weeks gestation) has markedly improved. Unfortunately, a significant proportion of ELGANs will suffer from neurodevelopmental dysfunction. Cerebellar hemorrhagic injury (CHI) has been increasingly recognized in the ELGANs population and may contribute to neurologic dysfunction; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we developed a novel model of early isolated posterior fossa subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in neonatal mice and investigated both acute and long-term effects. Following SAH on postnatal day 6 (P6), we found significant decreased levels of proliferation with the external granular layer (EGL), thinning of the EGL, decreased Purkinje cell (PC) density, and increased Bergmann glial (BG) fiber crossings at P8. At P42, CHI resulted in decreased PC density, decreased molecular layer interneuron (MLI) density, and increased BG fiber crossings. Results from both Rotarod and inverted screen assays did not demonstrate significant effects on motor strength or learning at P35-38. Treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug Ketoprofen did not significantly alter our findings after CHI, suggesting that treatment of neuro-inflammation does not provide significant neuroprotection post CHI. Further studies are required to fully elucidate the mechanisms through which CHI disrupts cerebellar developmental programming in order to develop therapeutic strategies for neuroprotection in ELGANs.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterial mutants blocked in ring degradation constructed to achieve C19 synthons production, also accumulate by-products such as C22 intermediates throughout an alternative pathway reducing the production yields and complicating the downstream purification processing of final products. In this work, we have identified the MSMEG_6561 gene, encoding the only aldolase on the chromosome responsible for the transformation of 22-hydroxy-3-oxo-cholest-4-ene-24-carboxyl-CoA (22-OH-BCN-CoA) into the 22-hydroxy-23,24-bisnorchol-4-ene-3-one (4-HBC) precursor (20S)-3-oxopregn-4-ene-20-carboxaldehyde (3-OPA). The deletion of this gene increases the production yield of the C-19 steroidal synthon 4-androstene-3,17-dione (AD) from natural sterols, avoiding the production of 4-HBC as by-product and the drawbacks in the AD purification. The molar yield of AD production using the MS6039-5941-6561 triple mutant strain was checked in flasks and bioreactor improving very significantly compared with the previously described MS6039-5941 strain.",

    "abstract": "Disruption of neocortical circuitry and architecture in humans causes numerous neurodevelopmental disorders. Neocortical cytoarchitecture is orchestrated by various transcription factors such as Satb2 that control target genes during strict time windows. In humans, mutations of SATB2 cause SATB2 Associated Syndrome (SAS), a multisymptomatic syndrome involving intellectual disability, speech delay, epilepsy and craniofacial defects. We show that Satb2 controls neuronal migration and axonal outgrowth by inducing the expression of the GPI-anchored protein, Sema7A. We find that heterodimerization with Sema4D increases targeting of Sema4D to the membrane and is required for Sema7A function. Finally, we report that membrane localization and pos- translational modification of the Sema7A-Sema4D complex is disrupted by a novel de novo mutation in Sema4D (Q497P) that is associated with epilepsy in humans.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=197 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/527998v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (48K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@db698org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4ee980org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c3d9d6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12a135_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LISema7A is a direct Satb2 target that drives neuronal migration and axon outgrowth\nC_LIO_LISema7A exerts its effect by heterodimerizing with Sema4D at neurites and growth cones\nC_LIO_LISema7A increases cell surface localization of Sema4D\nC_LIO_LIDe novo human Sema4D-Q497P mutation causes epilepsy, inhibits post-translational processing & surface localization\nC_LI\n\neTOCSema7A is a direct target of the transcription factor Satb2.
