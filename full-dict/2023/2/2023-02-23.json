    "abstract": "The mitochondrial Complex I assembly (MCIA) complex is an essential player in the biogenesis of respiratory Complex I (CI), the multiprotein complex responsible for the initiation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). It is not well understood how MCIA facilitates the assembly of CI. Here we report the structural basis of the complex formation between the MCIA subunits ECSIT and ACAD9. ECSIT binding induces a major conformational change in the FAD-binding loop of ACAD9, resulting in efflux of the FAD cofactor and redeployment of ACAD9 from fatty acid {beta}-oxidation (FAO) to CI assembly. We identify an adjacent -helix as a key structural element that specifically enables the CI assembly functionality of ACAD9, distinguishing it from its closely related VLCAD counterpart. Furthermore, we show that ECSIT is phosphorylated in vitro and ex cellulo and provide evidence that phosphorylation downregulates its association with ACAD9. Interestingly, ECSIT has previously been linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease and here we show that ECSIT phosphorylation in neuronal cells is reduced upon exposure to amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) oligomers.\n\nThese findings shed light on the assembly of the MCIA complex and implicate ECSIT as a potential reprogrammer of bioenergetic metabolic pathways that can be altered when mitochondria are affected by A{beta} toxicity, a hallmark of Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "We study the response of a quantitative trait to exponential directional selection in a finite haploid population, both on the genetic and the phenotypic level. We assume an infinite sites model, in which the number of new mutations per generation in the population follows a Poisson distribution (with mean {Theta}) and each mutation occurs at a new, previously monomorphic site. Mutation effects are beneficial and drawn from a distribution. Sites are unlinked and contribute additively to the trait. Assuming that selection is stronger than random genetic drift, we model the initial phase of the dynamics by a slightly supercritical Galton-Watson process. This enables us to obtain time-dependent results. We show that the copy-number distribution of the mutant in generation n, conditioned on survival until n, is described accurately by the deterministic increase from an initial distribution with mean 1. This distribution corresponds to the absolutely continuous part W+ of the random variable, typically denoted W, that characterizes the stochasticity accumulating during the mutants sweep. In bypassing, we prove the folklore result that W+ is approximately exponentially distributed, but in general not exactly so by deriving its second and third moment. A proper transformation yields the approximate mutant frequency dynamics in a Wright-Fisher population of size N. Then we derive explicitly the (approximate) time dependence of the expected mean and variance of the trait and of the expected number of segregating sites. Unexpectedly, we obtain highly accurate expressions even for the quasi-stationary phase, when the expected per-generation response has equilibrated. These refine classical results, and they are derived from first principles. We find that {Theta} is the main determinant of the pattern of adaptation at the genetic level, i.e., whether the response is mainly due to sweeps or to small allele-frequency shifts, and the number of segregating sites is an appropriate indicator for it. The selection strength determines primarily the rate of adaptation. The accuracy of our results is tested for a Poisson offspring distribution by comprehensive simulations in a Wright-Fisher framework.",

    "abstract": "CTCF is a key factor in three-dimensional chromatin folding and transcriptional control that was found to affect cancer cell migration by a mechanism that is still poorly understood. To identify this mechanism, we used mouse melanoma cells with a partial loss of function (pLoF) of CTCF. We found that CTCF pLoF inhibits cell migration rate while leading to an increase in the expression of multiple enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway along with an elevation in the cellular cholesterol levels. Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in CTCF pLoF cells restored the cellular migration rate, suggesting that CTCF supports cell migration by suppressing cholesterol synthesis. Detailed analysis of the promoter of Hmgcs1, an early enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, revealed that CTCF enables PRC2 recruitment to the promoter and deposition of H3K27me3 to prevent SREBP2 binding and activation of transcription. By this mechanism CTCF fine-tunes cholesterol levels to support cell migration. Notably, genome wide association studies suggest a link between CTCF and cholesterol-associated diseases, thus CTCF emerges as a new regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis.",

It is well established that Hsp70 upregulation during post-heat shock stimulus is mediated by cap-dependent translation. However, the molecular mechanisms of Hsp70 expression during heat shock stimulus remains elusive, even though the 5 end of Hsp70 mRNA may form a compact structure to positively regulate protein expression in the mode of cap-independent translation. The minimal truncation which can fold to a compact structure was mapped and its secondary structure was characterized by chemical probing. The predicted model revealed a highly compact structure with multiple stems. Including the stem where the canonical start codon is located, several stems were identified to be vital for RNA folding, thereby providing solid structural basis for future investigations on the function of this RNA structure on Hsp70 translation during heat shock.",

    "abstract": "Optical aberration is a crucial issue in optical microscopes, which fundamentally limits the practical imaging performance. As a commonly encountered one, spherical aberration is introduced by the refractive index mismatches between samples and environments, which will cause problems like low contrast, blurring, and distortion in imaging. Light-field microscopy (LFM) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for fast volumetric imaging. The appearance of spherical aberration in LFM will cause large changes of the point spread function (PSF) and thus greatly affects the imaging performance. Here, we propose the aberration-modeling view-channel-depth (AM-VCD) network for LFM reconstruction, which can well mitigate the influence of large spherical aberration. By quantitatively estimating the spherical aberration in advance and modeling it in the network training, the AM-VCD can obtain aberration-corrected high-speed visualization of three-dimensional (3D) processes with uniform spatial resolution and real-time reconstruction speed. Without any hardware modification, our method provides a convenient way to directly observe the 3D dynamics of samples in solution. We demonstrate the capability of AM-VCD under a large refractive index mismatch with volumetric imaging of a large-scale fishbone of largemouth bass. We further investigate the capability of AM-VCD in real-time volumetric imaging of dynamic zebrafish for tracking neutrophil migration.",

While the increasing availability of multiple data modalities is expected to provide a more accurate clustering and characterisation of cells, the development of computational methods that are capable of extracting information embedded across data modalities is still in its infancy.\n\nResultsWe propose SnapCCESS for clustering cells by integrating data modalities in multimodal singlecell omics data using an unsupervised ensemble deep learning framework. By creating snapshots of embeddings of multimodality using variational autoencoders, SnapCCESS can be coupled with various clustering algorithms for generating consensus clustering of cells. We applied SnapCCESS with several clustering algorithms to various datasets generated from popular multimodal single-cell omics technologies. Our results demonstrate that SnapCCESS is effective and more efficient than conventional ensemble deep learning-based clustering methods and outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal embedding generation methods in integrating data modalities for clustering cells. The improved clustering of cells from SnapCCESS will pave the way for more accurate characterisation of cell identity and types, an essential step for various downstream analyses of multimodal single-cell omics data.\n\nAvailability and implementationSnapCCESS is implemented as a Python package and is freely available from https://github.com/yulijia/SnapCCESS.",

    "abstract": "YiiP is a prokaryotic Zn2+/H+ antiporter that serves as a model for the Cation Diffusion Facilitator (CDF) superfamily, members of which are generally responsible for homeostasis of transition metal ions. Previous studies of YiiP as well as related CDF transporters have established a homodimeric architecture and the presence of three distinct Zn2+ binding sites named A, B, and C. In this study, we use cryo-EM, microscale thermophoresis and molecular dynamics simulations to address the structural and functional roles of individual sites as well as the interplay between Zn2+ binding and protonation. Structural studies indicate that site C in the cytoplasmic domain is primarily responsible for stabilizing the dimer and that site B at the cytoplasmic membrane surface controls the structural transition from an inward facing conformation to an occluded conformation. Binding data show that intramembrane site A, which is directly responsible for transport, has a dramatic pH dependence consistent with coupling to the proton motive force. A comprehensive thermodynamic model encompassing Zn2+ binding and protonation states of individual residues indicates a transport stoichiometry of 1 Zn2+ to 2-3 H+ depending on the external pH. This stoichiometry would be favorable in a physiological context, allowing the cell to use the proton gradient as well as the membrane potential to drive the export of Zn2+.",

    "abstract": "One of the primary challenges of magnetic drug targeting is to achieve efficient and accurate delivery of drug particles to the desired sites in complex physiological conditions. Though a majority of drugs are delivered through intravenous administration, until now, the kinematics and dynamics of drug particles influenced by the magnetic field, vascular topology and blood flows are still less understood. In this work, a multi-physics dynamical model which captures transient particle motions in both artificial and in vivo-like 3D vascular networks manipulated by the time-varying magnetic field is developed. Based on the model, it is found that particles which perform a random walk with correlated speed and persistence (RWSP motion) inspired by the migratory motion of immune and metastasis cells have higher mobility and navigation ability in both 2D and 3D tree-like and web-like networks. Moreover, to steer particles to perform the efficient RWSP motion, a stochastic magnetic steering strategy which uses time-varying gradient magnetic field is proposed. Parameters of the steering strategy is optimized and the capability of controlling particles to achieve fast spreading and transport in the vascular networks is demonstrated. In addition, the influence of heterogeneous flows in the vascular networks on the particle steering efficiency is discussed. Overall, the numerical model and the magnetic steering strategy can be widely used in the drug delivery systems for precise medicine research.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs play an important role in modulating normal cellular functions through protein-protein interaction in addition to regulating gene expression via mRNA degradation or translational repression. PVT1 is a non-protein coding gene that encodes six annotated microRNAs (miRNAs), including miR-1207-3p, a demonstrated modulator in PCa. MiR-1207-3p is significantly underexpressed in PCa cells when compared to normal prostatic cells and directly targets fibronectin type III domain containing 1 (FNDC1), which was found to be overexpressed in PCa cells along with concomitant overexpression of fibronectin (FN1)/androgen receptor (AR)/c-MYC. To better understand the role of FNDC1/FN1/AR/c-MYC in PCa progression we examined the interaction between FNDC1/FN1/AR/c-MYC. Coimmunoprecipitation study showed direct physical interaction between FNDC1/FN1/AR/c-MYC in PCa cells and FN1/AR/cMYC in normal prostatic cell. Knockdown of FN1, AR and cMYC not only confirmed FN1/FNDC1/AR/cMYC interaction but also gave rise to the possibility of a complex. We also examined the spatial localization of the FNDC1/FN1/AR/c-MYC pathway by performing immunofluorescence staining in PCa cells. Single staining analysis revealed that FNDC1, AR and c-MYC localize to the nucleus and cytoplasm while FN1 localizes only to the cytoplasm in PCa cells but not in the non-tumorigenic prostate cells. However, our findings show that miR-1207-3p has no direct effect on the FNDC1/FN1/AR/cMYC interaction.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and targeting strategies are yet to be explored.\n\nMethodsApoptotic breast cancer cells induced by paclitaxel treatment were sorted and their released exosomes (exo-dead) were isolated from the cell supernatants. Chemokine array analysis was conducted to identify the crucial molecules in exo-dead. Zebrafish and mouse xenograft models were used to investigate the effect of exo-dead on breast cancer progression in vivo. Multiple molecular biological experiments were conducted to determine the underlying mechanisms of exo-dead in promoting breast cancer, as well as its intervention values.\n\nResultsIt was demonstrated that exo-dead were phagocytized by macrophages and induced breast cancer metastasis by promoting the infiltration of immunosuppressive PD-L1+ TAMs. Chemokine array identified CXCL1 as a crucial component in exo-dead to activate TAM/PD-L1 signaling. Exosomal CXCL1 knockdown or macrophage depletion significantly inhibited exo-dead-induced breast cancer growth and metastasis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that CXCL1exo-dead enhanced TAM/PD-L1 signaling by transcriptionally activating EED-mediated PD-L1 promoter activity. More importantly, TPCA-1 (2-[(aminocarbonyl) amino]-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-thiophenecarboxamide) was screened as a promising inhibitor targeting exosomal CXCL1 signals to enhance paclitaxel chemosensitivity and limit breast cancer metastasis without noticeable toxicities.\n\nConclusionsOur results highlight CXCL1exo-dead as a novel dying cell-released signal and provide TPCA-1 as a targeting candidate to improve breast cancer prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is an incurable chronic inflammatory skin disease characterised by immune cytokine-stimulated epidermal hyperproliferation. This results in the skin becoming red with scaly plaques that can appear anywhere on the body, decreasing the quality of life for patients. Previous modelling studies of psoriasis have been limited to 2D models and lacked cell-cell interactions. We have developed a 3D agent-based model of epidermal cell dynamics to gain insights into how immune cytokine stimuli induces hyperproliferation in psoriasis to better understand disease formation and structural changes. Three main keratinocytes, stem, transit-amplifying (TA), differentiated and T cells, are modelled with proliferation and division governed by various nutrients and immune cytokines. Each cell has a set of attributes (growth rate, division probability, position, etc) whose values are governed by processes such as monod-based cellular growth model, probability-based division based on calcium and cytokine concentration and various forces to form the epidermal layers. The model has 2 steady states, healthy (non-lesional) and psoriatic (lesional) skin. Transition from healthy to psoriatic state is triggered by a temporary cytokine stimulus which causes hyperproliferation to occur, a hallmark of psoriasis. This results in the deepening of rete ridges and thickening of the epidermal structure. Model outputs has been validated against population ratios of stem, TA, differentiated, and T cells, cell cycle and turnover times in vivo. The model simulates the structural properties of epidermis, including layer stratification, formation of wave-like rete ridges, change in epidermal height and length of rete ridges from healthy to psoriasis. This has provided some insights on the complex spatio-temporal changes when transitioning between the 2 steady states and how a shot of temporary cytokine stimulus can induce different severity of psoriasis and alters proliferation between healthy and psoriatic skin in line with known literature. This provides the basis to study different cytokine simulation variations of psoriasis development and tracking of cell proliferation in the lab. It also provides a baseline to model the effects of psoriasis treatments such as narrowband-ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) or biologics and predict potential treatment outcomes for patients.",

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder and Alzheimers disease are two prevalent and devastating disorders that still lack effective treatment. Despite distinct disease phenotypes, these two disorders are characterized by similar neuroinflammatory processes. However, it is not clear to what extent these processes are shared. To compare pathways and their regulators affected in Alzheimers disease and depression, we adopted a systems biology approach. Consensus gene regulatory networks were built from RNA-seq data with GENIE3, CLR and Lemon-Tree. The two consensus networks were functionally characterized and compared to one another. Further, single-cell gene regulatory networks were constructed with SCENIC, to further characterize the regulatory programs active in specific cell types. In both disorders, aberrations in immune mechanisms and microglial activation were found, controlled by the same transcription factors (IKZF1, IRF8, NFATC2, RUNX1, SPI1, and TAL1). These transcription factors have been implicated in Alzheimers disease before, while only one has been associated with depression hitherto. Moreover, in Alzheimer, dysfunctions in mitochondria, the proteasome and myelination were discovered. In depression, astrocyte function, GABA receptor signaling, and transport across the blood-brain barrier were aberrated. These disrupted pathways and transcription factors should be further investigated and might be used to develop novel therapies for neuroinflammatory disorders.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell atlases across conditions are essential in the characterization of human disease. In these complex experimental designs, patient samples are profiled across distinct cell-types and clinical conditions to describe disease processes at the cellular level. However, most of the current analysis tools are limited to pairwise cross-condition comparisons, disregarding the multicellular nature of disease processes and the effects of other biological and technical factors in the variation of gene expression. Here we propose a computational framework for an unsupervised analysis of samples from cross-condition single-cell atlases and for the identification of multicellular programs associated with disease. Our strategy, that repurposes multi-omics factor analysis, incorporates the variation of patient samples across cell-types and enables the joint analysis of multiple patient cohorts, facilitating integration of atlases. We applied our analysis to a collection of acute and chronic human heart failure single-cell datasets and described multicellular processes of cardiac remodeling that were conserved in independent spatial and bulk transcriptomics datasets. In sum, our framework serves as an exploratory tool for unsupervised analysis of cross-condition single-cell atlas and allows for the integration of the measurements of patient cohorts across distinct data modalities, facilitating the generation of comprehensive tissue-centric understanding of disease.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=71 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/529642v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (16K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@72269org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@645808org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cf9d6dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1686e65_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Perceptual systems are constrained by their information transmission capacity. Accordingly, organismal strategies for compressing environmental information have been the subject of considerable study. The efficient coding model posits maximized mutual information between stimuli and their neural representation. The reward maximization model posits minimized signal distortion, operationalized as reward foregone due to stimulus confusion. The matched filters model posits the preferential transmission of information that informs evolutionarily important decisions. Unfortunately, the efficient coding model is sometimes at odds with empirical findings, and all three models struggle with recapitulating each others predictions. Here I aim to reconcile the models by developing a framework for modeling compression in which: compression strategies dictate stimulus representations, compressed stimulus representations inform decisions, decisions deliver rewards, environments differ in decision-reward associations and fitness function, and therefore, different environments select for different compression strategies. Using this framework, I construct environments in which the fittest compression strategy: optimizes signal distortion, optimizes both signal distortion and mutual information, and optimizes neither but nevertheless is fit because it facilitates the avoidance of catastrophically risky decisions. Thus, by modeling compression as optimal with respect to fitness, I enable the matched filters model to recapitulate the predictions of the others. Moreover, these results clarify that mutual information maximization and signal distortion minimization are favored by selection only under certain conditions. Hence, the efficient coding model is reconciled with the findings that it fails to predict, because those findings can now be understood to derive from outside the models proper scope of application. Going forward, the optimal-fitness framework is poised to be a useful tool for further developing our understanding of natures perceptual compressions; a salient reason why is that it enables empirical findings to be bridged not only with concepts from information theory, but also economics.\n\nAuthor SummaryPerceptual systems are constrained by their information transmission capacity. Thus, stimuli are not transmitted in full detail, but are instead compressed. Presently, there are several extant models of compression that are supported by empirical results. However, they do not recapitulate each others predictions, and are not bound by any common conceptual framework. In the present study, I create a common conceptual framework: the optimal-fitness framework, which allows for the evaluation of the evolutionary fitness of a particular compression in a particular environmental context. This framework, in turn, allows me to define the features of the environments that favor the compressions predicted by the extant models. These findings serve to refine the extant models by defining their domain of applicability, and to unify the models by demonstrating the existence of environments in which their predictions overlap. Furthermore, the optimal fitness framework accommodates the expression of, and the demonstration of the evolutionary value of, various naturalistically plausible compressions that are not predicted by the existing models.",

    "abstract": "Vocal signals mediate much of human and non-human communication. Key performance traits - such as repertoire size, speed and accuracy of delivery - affect communication efficacy in fitness-decisive contexts such as mate choice and resource competition1. Specialized fast vocal muscles2,3 are central to accurate sound production4, but it is unknown whether vocal, like limb muscles5,6, need exercise to gain and maintain peak performance7,8. Here, we show that for song development in juvenile songbirds, the closest analogue to human speech acquisition9, regular vocal muscle exercise is crucial to achieve adult peak muscle performance. Furthermore, adult vocal muscle performance reduces within two days of abolishing exercise, leading to downregulation of critical proteins transforming fast to slower muscle fibre types. Daily vocal exercise is thus required to both gain and maintain peak vocal muscle performance, and if absent changes vocal output. We show that conspecifics can detect these acoustic changes and females prefer the song of exercised males. Song thus contains information on recent exercise status of the sender. Daily investment in vocal exercise to maintain peak performance is an unrecognized cost of singing and could explain why many birds sing daily even under adverse conditions10. Because neural regulation of syringeal and laryngeal muscle plasticity is equivalent, vocal output may reflect recent exercise status in all vocalizing vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo explore the regulatory effect of Trichinella spiralis ES antigen on the intestinal immune function, we observed the immune response of mouse small intestine to this antigen by quantifying the changes in the related cytokines of Tuft-IL-25-ILC2 pathway.\n\nMethodsA total of 30 BALB/c female mice were randomly divided into three groups: control group, Trichinella excretion-secretion (ES) antigen stimulation group, and IL-25 blocking group. The mice in the control group were injected intraperitoneally with PBS; those in the ES antigen stimulation group were injected intraperitoneally with ES antigen once per day for 7 consecutive days; and those in the IL-25 blocking group were injected intraperitoneally, first with anti-mouse IL-25 monoclonal antibody and 3 days later with ES antigen. Alcian blue-nuclear fast red staining was employed to observe the changes in the number of small intestinal goblet cells. The number of Tuft cells was determined by immunofluorescence chemical analysis, and the expression levels of IL-25, IL-13, IL-25R, Pou2f3, and ROR mRNA were quantified by RT-PCR.\n\nKey resultsThe results of Alcian blue-nuclear fast red staining showed that, compared with the control group, the number of goblet cells in the small intestinal tissue of mice in the ES antigen stimulation group increased, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Compared with the ES antigen stimulation group, the number of goblet cells in the small intestinal tissue of the mice in the IL-25 blocking group was slightly decreased (P<0.05). Immunofluorescence analysis showed that, compared with the control group, the number of Tuft cells in the ES antigen-stimulated group increased (P<0.05), while in the IL-25 blocking group, the number of Tuft cells was decreased compared with that in the ES antigen stimulation group (P<0.05). RT-PCR analysis showed that, compared with the control group, the mRNA expression levels of IL-25, IL-13, IL- 25R, ROR and Pou2f3 in the small intestine of mice in the ES antigen stimulation group were increased (P<0.05); compared with the ES antigen stimulation group, the IL-25, IL-13, IL-25R, ROR and Pou2f3 mRNA expressions in the tissues of the mice in the IL-25 blocking group were decreased, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05).\n\nConclusionThe small intestinal mucosa of mice stimulated by Trichinella ES antigen may possess an immune function via the Tuft-IL-25-ILC2 pathway.",

    "abstract": "After clean drinking water, vaccination is the most impactful global health intervention. However, development of new vaccines against difficult-to-target diseases is hampered by the lack of diverse adjuvants for human use. Of particular interest, none of the currently available adjuvants induce Th17 cells. Here, we develop and test an improved liposomal adjuvant, termed CAF(R)10b, that incorporates a TLR-9 agonist. In a head-to-head study in non-human primates (NHPs), immunization with antigen adjuvanted with CAF(R)10b induced significantly increased antibody and cellular immune responses compared to previous CAF(R) adjuvants, already in clinical trials. This was not seen in the mouse model, demonstrating that adjuvant effects can be highly species specific. Importantly, intramuscular immunization of NHPs with CAF(R)10b induced robust Th17 responses that were observed in circulation half a year after vaccination. Furthermore, subsequent instillation of unadjuvanted antigen into the skin and lungs of these memory animals led to significant recall responses including transient local lung inflammation observed by Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT), elevated antibody titers, and expanded systemic and local Th1 and Th17 responses, including >20% antigen-specific T cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage. Overall, CAF(R)10b demonstrated an adjuvant able to drive true memory antibody, Th1 and Th17 vaccine-responses across rodent and primate species, supporting its translational potential.",

    "abstract": "Hidradenitis Suppurativa is a chronic inflammatory disease of which the pathogenesis is incompletely understood. Dermal fibroblasts have been previously identified as a major source of inflammatory cytokines, however information pertaining to the characteristics of subpopulations of fibroblasts in HS remains unexplored. Using in silico-deconvolution of whole-tissue RNAseq, Nanostring gene expression panels and confirmatory immunohistochemistry we identified fibroblast subpopulations in HS tissue and their relationship to disease severity and lesion morphology. Gene signatures of SFRP2+ fibroblast subsets were increased in lesional tissue, with gene signatures of SFRP1+ fibroblast subsets decreased. SFRP2+ and CXCL12+ fibroblast numbers, measured by IHC, were increased in HS tissue, with greater numbers associated with epithelialized tunnels and Hurley Stage 3 disease. Pro-inflammatory CXCL12+ fibroblasts were also increased, with reductions in SFRP1+ fibroblasts compared to healthy controls. Evidence of Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition was seen via altered gene expression of SNAI2 and altered protein expression of ZEB1, TWIST1, Snail/Slug, E-Cadherin and N-Cadherin in HS lesional tissue. The greatest dysregulation of EMT associated proteins was seen in biopsies containing epithelialized tunnels. The use of the oral Spleen tyrosine Kinase inhibitor Fostamatinib significantly reduced expression of genes associated with chronic inflammation, fibroblast proliferation and migration suggesting a potential role for targeting fibroblast activity in HS.",

    "abstract": "CD4+ T cells orchestrate adaptive immunity to circulating malaria parasites; yet cellular interactions and molecular mechanisms controlling Th1 and Tfh differentiation in the spleen remain to be fully defined in vivo. Here, using a murine model of CD4-dependent immunity, we tested if Slide-seqV2, a spatial transcriptomic method with near single-cell resolution, could determine the locations of multiple CD4+ T cell subsets and potentially interacting cellular partners in the spleen during infection. Firstly, Slide-seqV2 readily mapped splenic cellular structure and microanatomical change during infection. Next, computational integration with scRNA-seq reference datasets of splenocytes, stromal cells, and specifically of polyclonal CD4+ T cells and B cells, mapped the relative locations of multiple cell-types within this dense tissue. scRNA-seq of B cells over time mapped emergence of germinal centre B cells, red pulp-located plasmablasts and atypical B cells, and uncovered a prolonged CD4+ T-cell-independent, follicular bystander B cell response marked by Sca-1 and Ly6C upregulation. scRNA-seq of activated, polyclonal CD4+ T cells revealed their similarity to our previous TCR transgenic models. Importantly, spatial analysis revealed polyclonal Th1 cells co-localised with CXCL9/10-producing monocytes in the red pulp, while polyclonal Tfh-like cells were located close to CXCL13-expressing B cell follicles, consistent with our previous CXCR3/CXCR5 competition model of Th1/Tfh bifurcation. CRISPR/Cas9 disruption of either or both CXCR3 and CXCR5 in naive Plasmodium-specific CD4+ T cells had unexpectedly minor effects on Th1 differentiation in vivo. Instead, CXCR5 was essential for maximising clonal expansion, suggesting a role for splenic CXCL13+ cells in supporting CD4+ T cell proliferation in malaria. Thus, spatial transcriptomics at near single-cell resolution was feasible in densely packed secondary lymphoid tissue, providing multiple insights into mechanisms controlling splenic polyclonal CD4+ T cell and B cell differentiation during infection.\n\nHighlightsO_LISlide-seqV2 maps splenic microanatomy, including stromal and immune cell location.\nC_LIO_LIBystander activation of all follicular B cells occurs in malaria, marked by Sca-1/Ly6C upregulation.\nC_LIO_LISingle naive polyclonal CD4+ T cells differentiate mostly into Th1 and Tfh cells in malaria.\nC_LIO_LICell-cell colocalization analysis positions Th1 cells with monocytes in red pulp, and Tfh cells with Cxcl13+ B cell follicles.\nC_LIO_LICXCR5, but not CXCR3, supports parasite-specific CD4+ T cell clonal expansion.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates (BMCs) play an important role in the replication of a growing number of viruses, but many important mechanistic details remain to be elucidated. Previously, we demonstrated that pan-retroviral nucleocapsid (NC) and the HIV-1 pr55Gag (Gag) proteins phase separate into condensates, and that HIV-1 protease (PR)-mediated maturation of Gag and Gag-Pol precursor proteins yield self-assembling BMCs having HIV-1 core architecture. Using biochemical and imaging techniques, we aimed to further characterize the phase separation of HIV-1 Gag by determining which of its intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) influence the formation of BMCs and how the HIV-1 viral genomic RNA (gRNA) could influence BMC abundance and size. We found that mutations in the Gag matrix (MA) domain or the NC zinc finger motifs altered condensate number and size in a salt-dependent manner. Gag BMCs were also bimodally influenced by the gRNA, with a condensate-promoting regime at lower protein concentrations and a gel dissolution at higher protein concentrations. Interestingly, incubation of Gag with CD4+ T cell nuclear lysates led to the formation of larger BMCs as compared to much smaller ones observed in the presence of cytoplasmic lysates. These findings suggests that the composition and properties of Gag-containing BMCs may be altered by differential association of host factors in nuclear and cytosolic compartments during virus assembly. This study significantly advances our understanding of HIV-1 Gag BMC formation and provides a foundation for future therapeutic targeting of virion assembly.",

    "abstract": "Tellurium (Te) is a rare element in the chalcogen group, and its biogeochemical cycle has been investigated for decades. As the most soluble Te species, tellurite (Te(IV)) possess the highest toxicity to the organisms. Chemical or biological Te(IV) reduction to elemental tellurium (Te0) is generally considered as an effective detoxification route for Te(IV)-containing wastewater. Here, we reported a previously overlooked Te0 oxidation process mediated by manganese-oxidizing bacterium Bacillus sp. FF-1. This strain has both Mn(II)-oxidizing and Te(IV)-reducing activities, which could produce manganese oxides (BioMnOx) and Te0 (BioTe0) when incubating with Mn(II) and Te(IV), respectively. Te(IV) can co-precipitated with Mn(II) to form highly stable Te(IV)-Mn(II) compounds with low bioavailability. While when 5 mM Mn(II) was added after incubating 0.1 mM or 1 mM Te(IV) with strain FF-1 for 16 hours, the BioTe0 were certainly re-oxidized to Te(IV) by BioMnOx according to the results of X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and Transmission electron microscope (TEM). The chemogenic and exogenous biogenic Te0 can also be oxidized by the BioMnOx, although with different rates. This study highlights a new transformation process of tellurium species mediated by manganese-oxidizing bacteria, revealing that the environmental fate and ecological risks of Te0 needed to be re-evaluated.\n\nImportanceBiogeochemical cycle of Te mediated by bacteria mainly focus on the Tellurite reduction and methylation. In this study, the indirect tellurium (Te0) oxidation driven by manganese-oxidizing bacterium is firstly confirmed. As Te0 usually considered as a stable and safe products during Te(IV)-containing wastewater treatment, we suppose the ecological risks of Te0 needed to be re-evaluated due to the possible oxidation by manganese-oxidizing bacterium and its generated manganese oxides.",

    "abstract": "Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) has motivated a large body of research on mammalian mating strategies and sexual selection. Despite some contrary evidence, the narrative that larger males are the norm in mammals - upheld since Darwins Descent of Man - still dominates today, supported by meta-analyses that use crude measures of dimorphism and taxonomically-biased data. With newly-available datasets and primary sources reporting sex-segregated means and variances in adult body mass, we estimated statistically-determined rates of SSD in mammals, sampling taxa by their species richness at the family level. Our analyses of >400 species indicate that although males tend to be larger than females when dimorphism occurs, males are not larger in most mammals, and suggest a need to revisit other assumptions in sexual selection research.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryTaxonomically-balanced estimates of rates of sexual size dimorphism in mammals refute the  larger males narrative.",

    "abstract": "The present study reports the population structure, genetic admixture and phylogeography of island cattle breeds of Sri Lanka viz. Batu Harak, Thawalam and White cattle. Moderately high level of genetic diversity was observed. Estimates of inbreeding for Thawalam and White cattle breeds were relatively high with 6.1% and 7.2% respectively. Genetic differentiation of Sri Lankan Zebu (Batu Harak and White cattle) was lowest with Red Sindhi among Indus valley zebu while it was lowest with Hallikar among the South Indian cattle. Global F statistics showed 6.5% differences among all the investigated zebu cattle breeds and 1.9% differences among Sri Lankan zebu breeds. The Sri Lankan zebu cattle breeds showed strong genetic relationships with Hallikar cattle, an ancient breed considered to be ancestor for most Mysore type draught cattle breeds of South India. Genetic admixture analysis revealed high levels of breed purity in Lanka White cattle with >97% zebu ancestry while significant taurine admixture was observed in Batu Harak and Thawalam cattle. Two major zebu haplogroups, I1 and I2 were observed in Sri Lankan zebu with the former predominating the later in all the three breeds. A total of 112 haplotypes were observed in the studied breeds, of which 50 haplotypes were found in Sri Lankan zebu cattle. Mismatch analysis revealed unimodal distribution in all the three breeds indicating population expansion. The sum of squared deviations (SSD) and raggedness index were non-significant in both the lineages of all the three breeds except for I1 lineage of Thawalam cattle (P<0.01) and I2 lineage of Batu Harak cattle (P<0.05). The results of neutrality tests revealed negative Tajimas D values for both the lineages of Batu Harak (P>0.05) and White cattle (P>0.05) indicating an excess of low frequency polymorphisms and demographic expansion. Genetic dilution of native zebu cattle germplasm is a cause for concern and it is imperative that national breeding organizations consider establishing conservation units for the three native cattle breeds to maintain breed purity and initiate genetic improvement programs.",

    "abstract": "Small animal studies in biomedical research often require anesthesia to reduce pain or stress experienced by research animals and to minimize motion artifact for imaging or other measurements. Anesthetized animals should be closely monitored to avoid complications and unintended effects of altered physiology during such procedures. Many currently available monitoring devices can be expensive, invasive, or interfere with experimental design. Here, we present a low-cost device, based on a simple piezoelectric sensor, with a custom circuit and computer software that allows for measurements of both respiratory rate and heart rate in a non-invasive, minimal contact manner. We find the accuracy of the MousePZT device in measuring respiratory and heart rate under anesthesia and with pharmacologically induced changes in heart rate match those of commercial or more invasive systems. We also demonstrate that changes in respiratory rate can precede changes in heart rate associated with alterations in anesthetic depth. Additional circuitry on the device outputs a respiration locked trigger signal for respiratory-gating of imaging or other data acquisition that has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting respiratory cycles. We provide detailed construction documents and all necessary microcontroller and computer software, enabling straightforward adoption of this device.",

    "abstract": "Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase), the largest complex involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is composed of nuclear and mitochondrial encoded subunits. Its assembly requires sequential addition of subdomains and modules. As it is prone to oxidative damage, complex I subunits continually undergo proteolysis and turnover. We describe the mechanism by which complex I abundance is regulated in a complex I deficient mutant. Using a forward genetic approach we have identified that the complex I Q-module domain subunit PSST, interacts with FTSH3 (Filamentous Temperature Sensitive H3) to mediate the disassembly of the matrix arm domain module for proteolysis and turnover as a means of protein quality control. We show the direct interaction of FTSH3 with PSST and identify the amino acid residues required for this interaction. It is the ATPase function of FTSH3 that is required for the interaction, as the mutation can be compensated by a proteolytically inactive form of FTSH3. Furthermore, it cannot be compensated by FTSH10 that is also located in mitochondria, as the latter does not interact with PSST. This study reveals the mechanistic process at the resolution of the residues involved of how FTSH3 recognises complex I for degradation.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral strategies are often classified based on whether reinforcement is controlled by the value of the reinforcer. Value-sensitive behaviors, in which animals update their actions when reinforcer value is changed, are classified as goal-directed; conversely, value-insensitive actions, where behavior remains consistent when the reinforcer is removed or devalued, are considered habitual. Understanding the features of operant training that bias behavioral control toward either strategy is essential to understanding the cognitive and neuronal processes on which they rely. Using basic reinforcement principles, behavior can be biased toward relying on either process: random ratio (RR) schedules are thought to promote the formation of goal-directed behaviors while random intervals (RI) promote habitual control. However, how the schedule-specific features of these task structures relate to external factors to influence behavior is not well understood. Using male and female mice on distinct food restriction levels, we trained each group on RR schedules with responses-per-reinforcer rates matched to their RI counterparts to control for differences in reinforcement rate. We determined that food restriction level has a stronger effect on the behavior of mice following RR schedules than mice following RI schedules and that food restriction better predicted sensitivity to outcome devaluation than training schedule. Our results support the idea the relationships between RR or RI schedules with goal-directed or habitual behaviors, respectively, are more nuanced than previously appreciated and suggest that an animals engagement in a task must be accounted for, together with the structure of reinforcement schedules, to appropriately interpret the cognitive underpinnings of behavior.\n\nSignificance statementUnderstanding the basic learning principles that control behavior is essential to developing therapies for psychiatric disorders such as addiction or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Reinforcement schedules are thought to control the reliance on habitual versus goal-directed control during adaptive behaviors. However, external factors that are independent of training schedule also influence behavior, for example by modulating motivation or energy balance. In this study, we find that food restriction levels are at least equally important as reinforcement schedules in shaping adaptive behavior. Our results add to the growing body of work showing the distinction between habitual and goal-directed control is nuanced.",

    "abstract": "Episodic memory performance declines with increasing age, and older adults typically show reduced activation of inferior temporo-parietal cortices in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of episodic memory formation. Given the age-related cortical volume loss, it is likely that age-related reduction of memory-related fMRI activity can partially be attributed to reduced grey matter volume (GMV). We performed a voxel-wise multimodal neuroimaging analysis of fMRI correlates of successful memory encoding, using regional GMV as covariate. In a large cohort of healthy adults (106 young, 111 older), older adults showed reduced GMV across the entire neocortex and reduced encoding-related activation of inferior temporal and parieto-occipital cortices compared to young adults. Importantly, these reduced fMRI activations during successful encoding in older adults could in part be attributed to lower regional GMV. Our results highlight the importance of controlling for structural MRI differences in fMRI studies in older adults but also demonstrate that age-related differences in memory-related fMRI activity cannot be attributed to structural variability alone.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/529668v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f9d91org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@131cde9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c59b62org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15c4788_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Methadone-based treatment for pregnant women with opioid use disorder is quite prevalent in the clinical environment. A number of clinical and animal model-based studies have reported cognitive deficits in infants prenatally exposed to methadone-based opioid treatments. However, the long-term impact of prenatal opioid exposure (POE) on pathophysiological mechanisms that govern neurodevelopmental impairment is not well understood. Using a translationally relevant mouse model of prenatal methadone exposure (PME), the aim of this study is to investigate the role of cerebral biochemistry and its possible association with regional microstructural organization in PME offspring. To understand these effects, 8- week-old male offspring with PME (n=7) and prenatal saline exposure (PSE) (n=7) were scanned in vivo on 9.4 Tesla small animal scanner. Single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) was performed in the right dorsal striatum (RDS) region using a short echo time (TE) Stimulated Echo Acquisition Method (STEAM) sequence. Neurometabolite spectra from the RDS was first corrected for tissue T1 relaxation and then absolute quantification was performed using the unsuppressed water spectra. High-resolution in vivo diffusion MRI (dMRI) for region of interest (ROI) based microstructural quantification was also performed using a multi-shell dMRI sequence. Cerebral microstructure was characterized using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and Bingham-neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (Bingham-NODDI). MRS results in the RDS showed significant decrease in N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), taurine (tau), glutathione (GSH), total creatine (tCr) and glutamate (Glu) concentration levels in PME, compared to PSE group. In the same RDS region, mean orientation dispersion index (ODI) and intracellular volume fraction (VFIC) demonstrated positive associations with tCr in PME group. ODI also exhibited significant positive association with Glu levels in PME offspring. Significant reduction in major neurotransmitter metabolites and energy metabolism along with strong association between the neurometabolites and perturbed regional microstructural complexity suggest a possible impaired neuroadaptation trajectory in PME offspring which could be persistent even into late adolescence and early adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosoma brucei and related kinetoplastid parasites possess unique RNA processing pathways, including in their mitochondria, that regulate metabolism and development. Altering RNA composition or conformation through nucleotide modifications is one such pathway, and modifications including pseudouridine regulate RNA fate and function in many organisms. We surveyed pseudouridine synthase (PUS) orthologs in Trypanosomatids, with a particular interest in mitochondrial enzymes due to their potential importance for mitochondrial function and metabolism. T. brucei mt-LAF3 is an ortholog of human and yeast mitochondrial PUS enzymes, and a mitoribosome assembly factor, but structural studies differ in their conclusion as to whether it has PUS catalytic activity. Here, we generated T. brucei cells that are conditionally null for mt-LAF3 and showed that mt-LAF3 loss is lethal and disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}m). Addition of a mutant gamma-ATP synthase allele to the conditionally null cells permitted {Delta}{Psi}m maintenance and cell survival, allowing us to assess primary effects on mitochondrial RNAs. As expected, these studies showed that loss of mt-LAF3 dramatically decreases levels of mitochondrial 12S and 9S rRNAs. Notably, we also observed decreases in mitochondrial mRNA levels, including differential effects on edited vs. pre-edited mRNAs, indicating that mt-LAF3 is required for mitochondrial rRNA and mRNA processing, including of edited transcripts. To assess the importance of PUS catalytic activity in mt-LAF3 we mutated a conserved aspartate that is necessary for catalysis in other PUS enzymes and showed it is not essential for cell growth, or maintenance of {Delta}{Psi}m and mitochondrial RNA levels. Together, these results indicate that mt-LAF3 is required for normal expression of mitochondrial mRNAs in addition to rRNAs, but that PUS catalytic activity is not required for these functions. Instead, our work, combined with previous structural studies, suggests that T. brucei mt-LAF3 acts as a mitochondrial RNA-stabilizing scaffold.",

However, the mechanisms of pathogen interference with host metabolism remain poorly understood. Here we show that a novel glutamine metabolism antagonist, JHU083, inhibits Mtb proliferation in vitro and in vivo. JHU083-treated mice exhibit weight gain, improved survival, a 2.5 log lower lung bacillary burden at 35 days post-infection, and reduced lung pathology. JHU083 treatment also initiates earlier T-cell recruitment, increased proinflammatory myeloid cell infiltration, and a reduced frequency of immunosuppressive myeloid cells when compared to uninfected and rifampin-treated controls. Metabolomics analysis of lungs from JHU083-treated Mtb-infected mice revealed reduced glutamine levels, citrulline accumulation suggesting elevated NOS activity, and lowered levels of quinolinic acid which is derived from the immunosuppressive metabolite kynurenine. When tested in an immunocompromised mouse model of Mtb infection, JHU083 lost its therapeutic efficacy suggesting the drugs host-directed effects are likely to be predominant. Collectively, these data reveal that JHU083-mediated glutamine metabolism inhibition results in dual antibacterial and host-directed activity against tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulated extracellular vesicle (EV) release has been implicated in various pathologies, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease and osteoarthritis. Despite clear therapeutic potential, drug screening for EV release modulators has yielded limited success due to the lack of a sensitive and scalable EV read-out system. Here, we employed CRISPR-Cas9 to engineer HEK293 cells expressing HA-NanoLuciferase-(NL)-tagged endogenous CD63. We found that under basal culture conditions, CD63-containing EVs are released via a mechanism that is independent of the exocytic SNARE protein SNAP23, presumably by direct budding from the plasma membrane. Endo-lysosome inhibition by chemical or genetic perturbation of vATPase strongly increased SNAP23 and nSmase2-dependent exosome secretion from intracellular compartments. Proteomic analysis revealed these exosomes are enriched for early- and late endosomal markers, but also for autophagosomal proteins. This suggests that a proportion of these exosomes originate from amphisomes, although chemical inhibition of canonical autophagy did not affect exosome secretion upon lysosome inhibition. Using a broad- spectrum kinase inhibitor screen, we identified and subsequently validated the lipid kinase PI4KIII{beta} as a critical mediator of exosome secretion and amphisome-mediated secretory autophagy, upon lysosome inhibition. We conclude that tagging of endogenous CD63 with NanoLuciferase represents a sensitive, scalable reporter strategy that enables identification of (druggable) modulators of EV biogenesis and release under physiological and pathological conditions.",

Loss of MAPH-9 caused ultrastructural MTD defects, dysregulated axonemal motor velocity, and perturbed cilia function.

To investigate the effect of rbfox1 deficiency on behaviour, we used rbfox1sa15940, a rbfox1 loss-of-function line. We found that rbfox1sa15940 mutants present hyperactivity, thigmotaxis, decreased freezing behaviour and altered social behaviour. We repeated these behavioural tests in a second rbfox1 loss-of-function line with a different genetic background, rbfox1del19, and found that rbfox1 deficiency affects behaviour similarly in this line, although there were some differences. rbfox1del19 mutants present similar thigmotaxis, but stronger alterations in social behaviour and lower levels of hyperactivity than rbfox1sa15940 fish. Taken together, these results suggest that rbfox1 deficiency leads to multiple behavioural changes in zebrafish that might be modulated by environmental, epigenetic and genetic background effects, and that resemble phenotypic alterations present in Rbfox1-deficient mice and in patients with different psychiatric conditions. Our study thus highlights the evolutionary conservation of rbfox1 function in behaviour and paves the way to further investigate the mechanisms underlying rbfox1 pleiotropy on the onset of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Mutagenicity testing is an essential component of health safety assessment. Duplex Sequencing (DS), an emerging high-accuracy DNA sequencing technology, may provide substantial advantages over conventional mutagenicity assays. DS could be used to eliminate reliance on standalone reporter assays and provide mechanistic information alongside mutation frequency (MF) data. However, the performance of DS must be thoroughly assessed before it can be routinely implemented for standard testing. We used DS to study spontaneous and procarbazine (PRC)-induced mutations in the bone marrow (BM) of MutaMouse males across a panel of 20 diverse genomic targets. Mice were exposed to 0, 6.25, 12.5, or 25 mg/kg-bw/day for 28 days by oral gavage and BM sampled 42 days post-exposure. Results were compared with those obtained using the conventional lacZ viral plaque assay on the same samples. DS detected significant increases in mutation frequencies and changes to mutation spectra at all PRC doses. Low intra-group variability within DS samples allowed for detection of increases at lower doses than the lacZ assay. While the lacZ assay initially yielded a higher fold-change in mutant frequency than DS, inclusion of clonal mutations in DS mutation frequencies reduced this discrepancy. Power analyses suggested that three animals per dose group and 500 million duplex base pairs per sample is sufficient to detect a 1.5-fold increase in mutations with >80% power. Overall, we demonstrate several advantages of DS over classical mutagenicity assays and provide data to support efforts to identify optimal study designs for the application of DS as a regulatory test.",

    "abstract": "The global distribution and constant evolution are challenges for the control of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), one of the most important viruses affecting swine worldwide. Effective control of PRRSV benefits from genotyping, which currently relies on Sanger sequencing. Here we developed and optimized procedures for real-time genotyping and whole genome sequencing of PRRSV directly from clinical samples based on targeted amplicon- and long amplicon tiling sequencing using the MinION Oxford Nanopore platform. Procedures were developed and tested on 154 clinical samples (including lung, serum, oral fluid and processing fluid) with RT-PCR Ct values ranging from 15 to 35. The targeted amplicon sequencing (TAS) approach was developed to obtain sequences of the complete ORF5 (main target gene for PRRSV genotyping) and partial ORF4 and ORF6 sequences of both PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 species. After only 5 min of sequencing, PRRSV consensus sequences with identities to reference sequences above 99% were obtained, enabling rapid identification and genotyping of clinical PRRSV samples into lineages 1, 5 and 8. The long amplicon tiling sequencing (LATS) approach targets type 2 PRRSV, the most prevalent viral species in the U.S. and China. Complete PRRSV genomes were obtained within the first hour of sequencing for samples with Ct values below 24.9. Ninety-two whole genome sequences were obtained using the LATS procedure. Fifty out of 60 sera (83.3%) and 18 out of 20 lung samples (90%) had at least 80% of genome covered at a minimum of 20X sequence depth per position. The procedures developed and optimized in this study here are valuable tools with potential for field application during PRRSV elimination programs.",

This same fractal distribution is also observed in the distribution of species mean group sizes in primates. Here we demonstrate that this preferential numbering arises because of the critical nature of dynamic self-organization within complex social networks. We calculate the size dependence of the scaling properties of complex social network models and argue that this aggregate behaviour exhibits a form of collective intelligence. Direct calculation establishes that the complexity of social networks as measured by their scaling behaviour is non-monotonic, peaking globally around 150 with a secondary peak at 500 and tertiary peaks centred on 15 and 50, thereby providing a theory-based rationale for the fractal layering of primate and human social groups.",

    "abstract": "The expression of virulence factors essential for the invasion of host cells by Salmonella enterica is tightly controlled by a network of transcription regulators. The AraC/XylS transcription factor HilD is the main integration point of environmental signals into this regulatory network, with many factors affecting HilD activity. Long chain fatty acids (LCFAs), which are highly abundant throughout the host intestine directly bind to, and repress HilD, acting as environmental cues to coordinate virulence gene expression. The regulatory protein HilE also negatively regulates HilD activity, through a protein-protein interaction. Both of these regulators inhibit HilD dimerisation, preventing HilD from binding to target DNA. We investigated the structural basis of these mechanisms of HilD repression. LCFAs bind to a conserved pocket in HilD, in a comparable manner to that reported for other AraC/XylS regulators, whereas HilE forms a stable heterodimer with HilD by binding to the HilD dimerisation interface. Our results highlight two distinct mechanisms by which HilD activity is repressed, which could be exploited for the development of new antivirulence leads.",

    "abstract": "Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) is a powerful multiplexed tissue imaging technology that allows simultaneous detection of more than 30 makers on a single slide. It has been increasingly used for singlecell-based spatial phenotyping in a wide range of samples. However, it only acquires a small, rectangle field of view (FOV) with a low image resolution that hinders downstream analysis. Here, we reported a highly practical dual-modality imaging method that combines high-resolution immunofluorescence (IF) and high-dimensional IMC on the same tissue slide. Our computational pipeline uses the whole slide image (WSI) of IF as a spatial reference and integrates small FOVs IMC into a WSI of IMC. The high-resolution IF images enable accurate single-cell segmentation to extract robust high-dimensional IMC features for downstream analysis. We applied this method in esophageal adenocarcinoma of different stages, identified the single-cell pathology landscape via reconstruction of WSI IMC images, and demonstrated the advantage of the dual-modality imaging strategy.\n\nMotivationHighly multiplexed tissue imaging allows visualization of the spatially resolved expression of multiple proteins at the single-cell level. Although imaging mass cytometry (IMC) using metal isotope-conjugated antibodies has a significant advantage of low background signal and absence of autofluorescence or batch effect, it has a low resolution that hampers accurate cell segmentation and results in inaccurate feature extraction. In addition, IMC only acquires mm2-sized rectangle regions, which limits its application and efficiency when studying larger clinical samples with non-rectangle shapes. To maximize the research output of IMC, we developed the dual-modality imaging method based on a highly practical and technical improvement requiring no extra specialized equipment or agents and proposed a comprehensive computational pipeline that combines IF and IMC. The proposed method greatly improves the accuracy of cell segmentation and downstream analysis and is able to obtain whole slide image IMC to capture the comprehensive cellular landscape of large tissue sections.",

Although the secondary structure of many human G4s is well characterized, in several gene-promoter regions multiple G4s are located in close proximity and may form three-dimensional structures which could ultimately influence their biological roles. In this contribution, we analyze the interplay between the three neighboring G4s present in the c-KIT proto-oncogene promoter, namely WK1, WSP and WK2. In particular, we highlight how these three G4s are structurally linked and how their crosstalk favors the formation of a parallel structure for WSP, differently from what observed for this isolated G4 in solution. Relying on all-atom molecular dynamic simulations exceeding the s time-scale and using enhanced sampling methods, we provide the first computationally-resolved structure of a well-organized G4 cluster in the promoter of a crucial gene involved in cancer development.

Using phosphomimetic variants, we identified pre-formed secondary structure elements, or short linear motif (SLiMs), that undergo specific conformational transitions upon phosphorylation. Of importance, such conformational transition favors arrestin-2 binding. Hence, our results suggest a model in which the cellular signaling specificity of GPCRs is encoded in the phosphorylation-dependent structuration of the C-terminal regions, which will subsequently modulate arrestin conformation and therefore GPCR:arrestin signaling outcomes.",

Besides, bht-A3 was associated with more grains per spikelet and a delay in flag leaf senescence rate. Importantly, favourable alleles viz., bht-A3 and grain protein content (gpc-B1) that delayed senescence are required to improve grain number and grain weight in the spike-branching RILs.

Despite of B cells being able to also respond to soluble antigens, in particular the in vivo importance of the IS and surface-tethered antigen recognition has strongly emerged in the recent years. The IS serves as a dynamic hub for multiple cellular actions but the molecular details of these functions, especially beyond the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signalling, remain poorly understood. Here, to address the lack in the systems level understanding of the IS, we setup methodology for comprehensive investigation of the composition of the primary mouse B cells IS at proteome level. Utilizing functionalized magnetic beads to mimic antigen presenting cells and trigger IS formation on them, we developed a method to specifically and robustly extract the cell adhesions on the beads, namely the IS or transferrin receptor mediated adhesion as a control. Our data revealed 661 proteins exclusively present in the IS at 15 minutes after BCR engagement, 13 exclusively in the control adhesions and 365 proteins shared between the samples. We got strong coverage of the known components of the IS as well as identified a plethora of unknown proteins and functional pathways with hitherto unknown roles in B cell IS. Thus, in this work, we validated the IS isolation method as a valuable tool to study early B cell activation by surface-bound antigens as well as unveil several novel proteins and pathways suggestive of new functional aspects in the IS.",

    "abstract": "Introductory Paragraph / AbstractThe bloodstream represents a hostile environment that bacteria must overcome to cause bacteraemia. To understand how the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus manages this we have utilised a functional genomics approach to identify a number of new loci that affect the ability of the bacteria to survive exposure to serum, the critical first step in the development of bacteraemia. The expression of one of these genes, tcaA, was found to be induced upon exposure to serum, and we show that it is involved in the elaboration of a critical virulence factor, the wall teichoic acids (WTA), within the cell envelope. The activity of the TcaA protein alters the sensitivity of the bacteria to cell wall attacking agents, including antimicrobial peptides, human defence fatty acids, and several antibiotics. This protein also affects the autolytic activity and lysostaphin sensitivity of the bacteria, suggesting that in addition to changing WTA abundance in the cell envelope, it also plays a role in peptidoglycan crosslinking. With TcaA rendering the bacteria more susceptible to serum killing, while simultaneously increasing the abundance of WTA in the cell envelope, it was unclear what effect this protein may have during infection. To explore this, we examined human data and performed murine experimental infections. Collectively, our data suggests that whilst mutations in tcaA are selected for during bacteraemia, this protein positively contributes to the virulence of S. aureus through its involvement in altering the cell wall architecture of the bacteria, a process that appears to play a key role in the development of bacteraemia.",

    "abstract": "Dipylidium caninum (Linnaeus, 1758) is a common zoonotic cestode of dogs and cats worldwide. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of largely host associated canine and feline genotypes based on infection studies, genetic differences at the nuclear 28S rDNA gene and complete mitochondrial genomes. There have been no comparative studies at a genome-wide scale. Here, we sequenced the genomes of a dog and cat isolate of Dipylidium caninum from the United States using the Illumina platform and conducted comparative analyses with the reference draft genome. Complete mitochondrial genomes were used to confirm the genotypes of the isolates. D. caninum canine and feline genomes generated in this study had mean coverage depths of 45x and 26x and an average identity of 98% and 89% respectively when compared to the reference genome. SNPs were 20 times higher in the feline isolate. Comparison and species delimitation using universally conserved orthologs and protein coding mitochondrial genes revealed that the canine and feline isolates are different species. Data from this study builds a base for future integrative taxonomy. Further genomic studies from geographically diverse populations are necessary to understand implications for taxonomy, epidemiology, veterinary clinical medicine, and anthelmintic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Women experience osteoporosis at higher rates than men. Aside from hormones, the mechanisms driving sex-dependent bone mass regulation are not well-understood. Here, we demonstrate that the X-linked H3K4me2/3 demethylase KDM5C regulates sex-specific bone mass. Loss of KDM5C in hematopoietic stem cells or bone marrow monocytes (BMM) increases bone mass in female but not male mice. Mechanistically, loss of KDM5C impairs the bioenergetic metabolism resulting in impaired osteoclastogenesis. Treatment with the KDM5 inhibitor reduces osteoclastogenesis and energy metabolism of both female mice and human monocytes.

Here, we present a mechanistic simulation of cell states that models the stochastic interactions of molecules revealing the DNA accessibility, RNA expression, and protein expression state of a simulated cell and how these states evolve over time. By designing each component to correspond to a specific biological molecule or parameter, the simulation becomes highly interpretable. From the simulated cells generated, we explore the importance of parameters such as splicing and degradation rates of genes on RNA and protein expression, demonstrating that perturbing these parameters leads to changes in long term gene and protein expression levels. We observe that the expression levels of corresponding RNA and proteins are not necessarily well correlated and identify mechanistic explanations that may help explain the similar phenomenon that has been observed in real cells. We evaluate whether the RNA data output from the simulation provides sufficient information to reconstruct the underlying regulatory relationships between genes. While predictive relationships can be inferred, direct causal regulatory relationships between genes cannot be reliably distinguished from other predictive relationships between genes arising independently from a direct regulatory mechanism. We observe the same inability to robustly distinguish causal gene regulatory relationships using simulated data from the simpler BoolODE model, suggesting this may be a limitation to the identifiability of network inference.",

The control of rodent grooming has been shown to be mediated by the dorsolateral striatum through lesion studies and in-vivo extracellular recordings. Yet, it is unclear how populations of neurons in the striatum encode grooming. We recorded single-unit extracellular activity from populations of neurons in freely moving mice and developed a semi-automated approach to detect self-grooming events from 117 hours of simultaneous multi-camera video recordings of mouse behavior. We first characterized the grooming transition-aligned response profiles of striatal projection neuron and fast spiking interneuron single units. We identified striatal ensembles whose units were more strongly correlated during grooming than during the entire session. These ensembles display varied grooming responses, including transient changes around grooming transitions or sustained changes in activity throughout the duration of grooming. Neural trajectories computed from the identified ensembles retain the grooming related dynamics present in trajectories computed from all units in the session. These results elaborate striatal function in rodent self-grooming and demonstrate that striatal grooming-related activity is organized within functional ensembles, improving our understanding of how the striatum guides action selection in a naturalistic behavior.",

    "abstract": "Adhesion between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) is mediated by heterodimeric ({beta}) integrin receptors that are intracellularly linked to the contractile actomyosin machinery. One of the proteins that control this link is talin, which organises cytosolic signalling proteins into discrete complexes on {beta}-integrin tails referred to as focal adhesions (FAs). The adapter protein KANK1 binds to talin in the region of FAs known as the adhesion belt. Here, we developed a novel crystallographic method to resolve the talin-KANK1 complex. This structure revealed that the talin binding KN motif of KANK1 has a novel fold, where a {beta}-turn stabilises the -helical region, explaining its specific interaction with talin R7 and high affinity. Single point mutants in KANK1 identified from the structure abolished the interaction and enabled us to examine KANK1 enrichment in the adhesion belt. Strikingly, in cells expressing a constitutively active form of vinculin that keeps the FA structure intact even in the presence of myosin inhibitors, KANK1 localises throughout the entire FA structure even when actomyosin tension is released. We propose a model whereby actomyosin forces on talin eliminate KANK1 from talin binding in the centre of FAs while retaining it at the adhesion periphery.",

    "abstract": "Plant phosphoproteomics provides a global view of phosphorylation-mediated signaling in plants; however, it demands high-throughput methods with sensitive detection and accurate quantification. Although protein precipitation is indispensable for removing contaminants and improving sample purity, it limits the sensitivity and throughput of plant phosphoproteomic analysis. The multiple handling steps involved in protein precipitation lead to sample loss and process variability. Herein, we developed an approach based on suspension trapping (S-Trap), termed tandem S-Trap-IMAC (immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography), by integrating an S-Trap micro column with an Fe-IMAC tip. Compared with a precipitation-based workflow, the tandem S-Trap-IMAC method deepened the coverage of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) phosphoproteome by more than 30%, with improved quantification accuracy and short sample processing time. We applied the tandem S-Trap-IMAC method for studying abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in Arabidopsis seedlings. We thus identified 24,055 phosphopeptides and quantified several key phosphorylation sites on core ABA signaling components across four time points. Our results show that the optimized workflow aids high-throughput phosphoproteome profiling of low-input plant samples.",

    "abstract": "Actinobacteria possess unique ways to regulate the oxoglutarate node located in the central position of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, a crossroad between energy conservation and nitrogen metabolism. Here, we studied the decarboxylative oxidation route that leads, through the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (ODH) complex, to the generation of succinyl-CoA and reduced equivalents to feed the respiratory chain. Compared to most organisms in which the oxidative decarboxylation and reductive acylation steps are carried out by different enzymes within the ODH complex, actinobacteria rely on an all-in-one protein (OdhA) in which both activities are carried out by the same polypeptide. We describe high-resolution cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography snapshots of representative enzymes from Mycobacterium smegmatis and Corynebacterium glutamicum, showing that OdhA is an 800-kDa homohexamer that folds into a three-blade propeller shape. The obligate trimeric and dimeric states of the acyltransferase and dehydrogenase domains, respectively, are critical for maintaining the overall assembly, where both domains interact via subtle readjustments of their interfaces. Complexes obtained with substrate analogues, reaction products and allosteric regulators illustrate how these domains operate. Furthermore, we provide additional insights into the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of this enzymatic machinery by the FHA (Fork-Head Associated) signalling protein OdhI, delivering new molecular details on how this actinobacterial-specific switching mechanism operates. Overall, the quaternary organization of OdhA represents a new piece of the fascinating puzzle of the synergistic, mixed pyruvate dehydrogenase/2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase actinobacterial supercomplex.",

    "abstract": "Many species of pathogenic gram-positive bacteria display covalently crosslinked protein polymers (called pili or fimbriae) that mediate microbial adhesion to host tissues. These structures are assembled by pilus-specific sortase enzymes that join the pilin components together via lysine-isopeptide bonds. The archetypal SpaA pilus from Corynebacterium diphtheriae is built by the CdSrtA pilus-specific sortase, which crosslinks lysine residues within the SpaA and SpaB pilins to build the shaft and base of the pilus, respectively. Here, we show that CdSrtA crosslinks SpaB to SpaA via a K139(SpaB)-T494(SpaA) lysine-isopeptide bond. Despite sharing only limited sequence homology, an NMR structure of SpaB reveals striking similarities with the N-terminal domain of SpaA (NSpaA) that is also crosslinked by CdSrtA. In particular, both pilins contain similarly positioned reactive lysine residues and adjacent disordered AB loops that are predicted to be involved in the recently proposed \"latch\" mechanism of isopeptide bond formation. Competition experiments using an inactive SpaB variant and additional NMR studies suggest that SpaB terminates SpaA polymerization by outcompeting NSpaA for access to a shared thioester enzyme-substrate reaction intermediate.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is a major regulatory tissue of whole-body metabolism and is composed of a diverse mixture of cell (fiber) types. Aging and several diseases differentially affect the various fiber types, and therefore, investigating the changes in the proteome in a fiber-type specific manner is essential. Recent breakthroughs in isolated single muscle fiber proteomics have started to reveal heterogeneity among fibers. However, existing procedures are slow and laborious requiring two hours of mass spectrometry time per single muscle fiber; 50 fibers would take approximately four days to analyze. Thus, to capture the high variability in fibers both within and between individuals requires advancements in high throughput single muscle fiber proteomics. Here we use a single cell proteomics method to enable quantification of single muscle fiber proteomes in 15 minutes total instrument time. As proof of concept, we present data from 53 isolated skeletal muscle fibers obtained from two healthy individuals analyzed in 13.25 hours. Adapting single cell data analysis techniques to integrate the data, we can reliably separate type 1 and 2A fibers. Sixty-five proteins were statistically different between clusters indicating alteration of proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation, muscle structure and regulation. Our results indicate that this method is significantly faster than prior single fiber methods in both data collection and sample preparation while maintaining sufficient proteome depth. We anticipate this assay will enable future studies of single muscle fibers across hundreds of individuals, which has not been possible previously due to limitations in throughput.",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of gene expression patterns during metazoan development is achieved by the actions of Polycomb group (PcG) complexes. An essential modification marking silenced genes is monoubiquitination of histone H2A lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub) deposited by the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the non-canonical Polycomb Repressive Complex 1. The Polycomb Repressive Deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex cleaves monoubiquitin from histone H2A lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub) to restrict focal H2AK119Ub at Polycomb target sites and to protect active genes from aberrant silencing. BAP1 and ASXL1, subunits that form active PR-DUB, are among the most frequently mutated epigenetic factors in human cancers, underscoring their biological importance. How PR-DUB achieves specificity for H2AK119Ub to regulate Polycomb silencing is unknown, and the mechanisms of most of the mutations in BAP1 and ASXL1 found in cancer have not been established. Here we determine a cryo-EM structure of human BAP1 bound to the ASXL1 DEUBAD domain in complex with a H2AK119Ub nucleosome. Our structural, biochemical, and cellular data reveal the molecular interactions of BAP1 and ASXL1 with histones and DNA that are critical for remodeling the nucleosome and thus establishing specificity for H2AK119Ub.

Macromolecular crowding enhances protein self-assembly in buffer experiments with added crowders, and crowding could therefore regulate protein function and organization in cells. In eukaryotic cells, protein condensation has been shown to increase with crowding. However, it is unclear what the effect of crowding is on native protein self-assembly in the highly crowded Escherichia coli cell. To determine the role of crowding in the self-assembly of a native protein, we study here the nucleoid-binding H-NS in E. coli and alter macromolecular crowding using a set of perturbations. We followed H-NS self-assembly using a FRET-based method for determining intermolecular interactions with a single genetic intervention. In dilute cell lysate, we see that H-NS self-assembly increases with salts, macromolecular crowding, and its own concentration. In E. coli, the oligomerization increases with crowding. We see that the response of H-NS oligomerization to a sudden crowding change is not immediate but requires time to adapt. Our findings implicate that in-cell crowding affects intracellular organization by promoting self-assembly.",

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a form of cell death caused by direct or indirect inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4 that leads to lethal lipid peroxidation. Several small molecule ferroptosis inducers (FINs) have been reported, yet little information is available regarding resistance mechanisms, particularly their interaction with the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) and ABCG2. Given the role that ABC transporters play in absorption, distribution, and excretion of many drugs, characterizing these interactions could provide information regarding oral bioavailability and brain penetration and may predict drug-drug interactions. Using ferroptosis-sensitive A673 cells transfected to express P-gp or ABCG2, we found that P-gp overexpression was able to confer resistance to FIN56 and the erastin derivatives imidazole ketone erastin and piperazine erastin. Results were confirmed with OVCAR8-derived NCI/ADR-RES cells that overexpress P-gp, where the P-gp inhibitor valspodar completely inhibited resistance to the FINs. P-gp-mediated resistance to imidazole ketone erastin and piperazine erastin was also reversed in UO-31 renal cancer cells by CRISPR-mediated knockout of ABCB1. At a concentration of 10 M, the FINs ML-162, GPX inhibitor 26a, and PACMA31 were able to increase intracellular rhodamine 123 fluorescence over 10-fold in P-gp-expressing MDR-19 cells and GPX inhibitor 26a was able to increase intracellular purpurin-18 fluorescence over 4-fold in ABCG2-expressing R-5 cells. Expression of P-gp may reduce the efficacy of these FINs in cancers that express the transporter and may prevent access to sanctuary sites such as the brain. The ability of some FINs to inhibit P-gp and ABCG2 suggests potential drug-drug interactions.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWhile several small-molecule ferroptosis inducers have been described, little work has addressed potential interactions with ABC transporters such as P-glycoprotein or ABCG2 that might limit bioavailability or brain penetration. We find that the ferroptosis inducers FIN56, imidazole ketone erastin, and piperazine erastin are substrates of P-glycoprotein. ML-162, GPX inhibitor 26a, and PACMA31 were found to inhibit P-glycoprotein, while GPX inhibitor 26a was additionally able to inhibit ABCG2, suggesting the potential for drug-drug interactions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundType 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterised by T cell mediated destruction of pancreatic beta-cells. Islet transplantation is an effective therapy, but its success is limited by islet quality and availability along with the need for immunosuppression. New approaches include use of stem cell-derived insulin-producing cells and immunomodulatory therapies, but a limitation is the paucity of reproducible animal models in which interactions between human immune cells and insulin-producing cells can be studied without the complication of xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease (xGVHD).\n\nMethodsWe expressed an HLA-A2-specific chimeric antigen receptor (A2-CAR) in human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and tested their ability to reject HLA-A2+ islets transplanted under the kidney capsule or anterior chamber of the eye of immunodeficient mice. T cell engraftment, islet function and xGVHD were assessed longitudinally.\n\nResultsThe speed and consistency of A2-CAR T cells-mediated islet rejection varied depending on the number of A2-CAR T cells and the absence/presence of co-injected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). When <3 million A2-CAR T cells were injected, co-injection of PBMCs accelerated islet rejection but also induced xGVHD. In the absence of PBMCs, injection of 3 million A2-CAR T cells caused synchronous rejection of A2+ human islets within 1 week and without xGVHD for 12 weeks.\n\nConclusionsInjection of A2-CAR T cells can be used to study rejection of human insulin-producing cells without the complication of xGVHD. The rapidity and synchrony of rejection will facilitate in vivo screening of new therapies designed to improve the success of isletreplacement therapies.",

Candida albicans invades the oral epithelium by receptor-induced endocytosis but this process is incompletely understood. We found that C. albicans infection of oral epithelial cells induces c-Met to form a multi-protein complex with E-cadherin and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). E-cadherin is necessary for C. albicans to activate both c-Met and EGFR and to induce the endocytosis of C. albicans. Proteomics analysis revealed that c-Met interacts with C. albicans Hyr1, Als3 and Ssa1. Both Hyr1 and Als3 were required for C. albicans stimulation of c-Met and EGFR in oral epithelial cells in vitro and for full virulence during OPC in mice. Treating mice with small molecule inhibitors of c-Met and EGFR ameliorated OPC, demonstrating the potential therapeutic efficacy of blocking these host receptors for C. albicans.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/529756v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1448372org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@111b411org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@144f3b8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dcf548_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIc-Met is an oral epithelial cell receptor for Candida albicans\nC_LIO_LIC. albicans infection causes c-Met and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to form a complex with E-cadherin, which is required for c-Met and EGFR function\nC_LIO_LIC. albicans Hyr1 and Als3 interact with c-Met and EGFR, inducing oral epithelial cell endocytosis and virulence during oropharyngeal candidiasis\nC_LIO_LIDual blockade of c-Met and EGFR ameliorates oropharyngeal candidiasis\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Steep Cone Geyser is a unique geothermal feature in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming (YNP), actively gushing silicon rich fluids along outflow channels possessing living and actively silicifying microbial biomats. To assess the geomicrobial dynamics occurring temporally and spatially at Steep Cone, samples were collected at discrete locations along one of Steep Cones outflow channels for both microbial community composition and aqueous geochemistry analysis during field campaigns in 2010, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Geochemical analysis characterized Steep Cone as an oligotrophic, surface boiling, silicious, alkaline-chloride thermal feature with consistent dissolved inorganic carbon and total sulfur concentrations down the outflow channel ranging from 4.59 {+/-} 0.11 to 4.26 {+/-} 0.07 mM and 189.7 {+/-} 7.2 to 204.7 {+/-} 3.55 M respectively. Furthermore, geochemistry remained relatively stable temporally with consistently detectable analytes displaying a relative standard deviation < 32%. A thermal gradient decrease of ~55{degrees}C was observed from the sampled hydrothermal source to the end of the sampled outflow transect (90.34{degrees}C {+/-} 3.38 to 35.06{degrees}C {+/-} 7.24). The thermal gradient led to temperature-driven divergence and stratification of the microbial community along the outflow channel. The hyperthermophile Thermocrinis dominates the hydrothermal source biofilm community, and the thermophiles Meiothermus and Leptococcus dominate along the outflow before finally giving way to more diverse and even microbial communities at the end of the transect. Beyond the hydrothermal source, phototrophic taxa such as Leptococcus, Chloroflexus, and Chloracidobacterium act as primary producers for the system supporting heterotrophic growth of taxa such as Raineya, Tepidimonas, and Meiothermus. Community dynamics illustrate large changes yearly driven by abundance changes of the dominant taxa in the system. Results indicate Steep Cone possesses dynamic outflow microbial communities despite stable geochemistry. These findings improve our understanding of thermal geomicrobiological dynamics and inform how we can interpret the silicified rock record.",

    "abstract": "Proliferation and migration of epidermal stem cells (EpSCs) are essential for epithelialization during skin wound healing. Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) has been reported to play an important role in wound healing, but the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Here we investigate the contribution of ANGPTL4 to full-thickness wound re-epithelialization and the underlying mechanisms using Angptl4 knockout mice. Immunohistochemical staining reveals that ANGPTL4 is significantly upregulated in the basal layer cells of the epidermis around the wound during cutaneous wound healing. ANGPTL4 deficiency impairs wound healing. H & E staining shows that ANGPTL4 deficiency significantly reduces the thickness, length and area of regenerated epidermis postwounding. Immunohistochemical staining for markers of EpSCs (6 integrin and {beta}1 integrin) and cell proliferation (PCNA) shows that the number and proliferation of EpSCs in the basal layer of the epidermis are reduced in ANGPTL4-deficient mice. In vitro studies show that ANGPTL4 deficiency impedes EpSC proliferation, causes cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and reduced the expression of cyclins D1 and A2, which can be reversed by ANGPTL4 overexpression. ANGPTL4 deletion suppresses EpSC migration, which is also rescued by ANGPTL4 overexpression. Overexpression of ANGPTL4 in EpSCs accelerates cell proliferation and migration. Collectively, our results indicate that ANGPTL4 promotes EpSCs proliferation by upregulating cyclins D1 and A2 expression and accelerating cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase, and ANGPTL4 promotes skin wound re-epithelialization by stimulating EpSC proliferation and migration. Our study reveals a novel mechanism underlying EpSC activation and re-epithelialization during cutaneous wound healing.",

Emerging evidence supports a role of the extracellular matrix (ECM), at the interface between blood and brain, in the progression of SVD pathology but this remains poorly characterized.\n\nTo address ECM role in SVD, we developed a co-culture model of mural and endothelial cells using human induced pluripotent stem cells from patients with COL4A1/A2 SVD-related mutations. This model revealed that these mutations induce apoptosis, migration defects, ECM remodelling and transcriptome changes in mural cells. Importantly, these mural cell defects exert a detrimental effect on endothelial cells tight junctions through paracrine actions. COL4A1/A2 models also express high levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and inhibiting MMP activity partially rescues the ECM abnormalities and mural cell phenotypic changes. These data provide a basis for targeting MMP as a therapeutic opportunity in SVD.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA novel human iPSC-derived model of genetic SVD due to collagen IV (COL4A1/A2) mutations is described\nC_LIO_LIMural cells expressing COL4A1/A2 mutations have prominent ECM abnormalities as seen in patients and mouse models and contribute to endothelial cells defects\nC_LIO_LIECM and endothelial cells abnormalities can be rescued by MMP inhibition in the COL4A1/A2 model\nC_LI",

Here, we developed a base editing (BE) approach exploiting a naturally occurring CD33 single nucleotide polymorphism leading to removal of full-length CD33 surface expression on edited cells. CD33 editing in human and nonhuman primate (NHP) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) protects from CD33-targeted therapeutics without affecting normal hematopoiesis in vivo, thus demonstrating potential for novel immunotherapies with reduced off-leukemia toxicity. For broader applications to gene therapies, we demonstrated highly efficient (>70%) multiplexed adenine base editing of the CD33 and gamma globin genes, resulting in long-term persistence of dual gene-edited cells with HbF reactivation in NHPs. In vitro, dual gene-edited cells could be enriched via treatment with the CD33 antibody-drug conjugate, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO).

    "abstract": "Sexual attraction and perception, governed by separate genetic circuits in different organs, are crucial for mating and reproductive success, yet the mechanisms of how these two aspects are integrated remain unclear. In Drosophila, the male-specific isoform of Fruitless (Fru), FruM, is known as a master neuro-regulator of innate courtship behavior to control perception of sex pheromones in sensory neurons. Here we show that the non-sex specific Fru isoform (FruCOM) is necessary for pheromone biosynthesis in hepatocyte-like oenocytes for sexual attraction. Loss of FruCOM in oenocytes resulted in adults with reduced levels of the cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), including sex pheromones, and show altered sexual attraction and reduced cuticular hydrophobicity. We further identify Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (Hnf4) as a key target of FruCOM in directing fatty acid conversion to hydrocarbons in adult oenocytes. fru- and Hnf4-depletion disrupts lipid homeostasis, resulting in a novel sex-dimorphic CHC profile, which differs from doublesex- and transformer-dependent sexual dimorphism of the CHC profile. Thus, Fru couples pheromone perception and production in separate organs for precise coordination of chemosensory communication that ensures efficient mating behavior.\n\nTeaserFruitless and lipid metabolism regulator HNF4 integrate pheromone biosynthesis and perception to ensure robust courtship behavior.",

    "abstract": "Circadian behavioral rhythms in Drosophila melanogaster are regulated by about 75 pairs of brain neurons. They all express the core clock genes but have distinct functions and gene expression profiles. To understand the importance of these distinct molecular programs, neuron-specific gene manipulations are essential. Although RNAi based methods are standard to manipulate gene expression in a cell-specific manner, they are often ineffective, especially in assays involving smaller numbers of neurons or weaker Gal4 drivers. We and others recently exploited a neuron-specific CRISPR-based method to mutagenize genes within circadian neurons. Here we further explore this approach to mutagenize three well-studied clock genes: the transcription factor gene vrille, the photoreceptor gene Cryptochrome (cry) and the neuropeptide gene Pdf. The CRISPR-based strategy not only reproduced their known phenotypes but also assigned cry function for different light mediated phenotypes to discrete, different subsets of clock neurons. We further tested two recently published methods for temporal regulation in adult neurons, inducible Cas9 and auxin-inducible gene expression system (AGES). The results were not identical, but both approaches successfully showed that the adult-specific knockout of the neuropeptide Pdf reproduces the canonical loss-of-function mutant phenotypes. In summary, a CRISPR-based strategy is a highly effective, reliable, and general method to temporally manipulate gene function in specific adult neurons.\n\nSignificance statementMost animals have specific brain neurons that regulate sleep-wake cycles and other aspects of circadian behavior. Drosophila has only about 150 of these clock neurons. Despite their small numbers, they have remarkably diverse anatomy and gene expression profiles. To address the different functions of these neurons, we used highly specific and efficient CRISPR-based methods to create cell type-specific disruptions of three traditional circadian genes. We were able to assign the function of the photoreceptor cryptochrome to two tiny subsets of clock neurons. In addition, two independent methods assigned the neuropeptide PDF to the adult stage. In summary, we find that the CRISPR-based methods are very efficient at studying adult specific functions of genes in small, discrete sets of neurons.",

Using a combination of experimental and bioinformatic analyses in several PARP inhibitor resistant ovarian cancer models, we demonstrate that combinatory inhibition of EHMT and PARP is effective in treating PARP inhibitor resistant ovarian cancers. Our in vitro studies show that combinatory therapy reactivates transposable elements, increases immunostimulatory dsRNA formation, and elicits several immune signaling pathways. Our in vivo studies show that both single inhibition of EHMT and combinatory inhibition of EHMT and PARP reduces tumor burden, and that this reduction is dependent on CD8 T cells.

Due to the lack of specific antibodies for TNBC, curative treatments for TNBC remain limited. Antibodies targeting TNBC have potential as diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Here, we generate a panel of nanobodies targeting TNBC cell lines by immunizing alpacas and subsequently panning the resulting phage libraries with TNBC cell lines. We show that several clones exclusively stain Her2-negative cells in tissues of breast cancer patients, and a few clones stain both Her2-positive and Her2-negative regions in these tissues.

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases are a major constraint on aquaculture. Genetic lines with different susceptibilities to diseases are useful models to identify resistance mechanisms to pathogens and to improve prophylaxis. Bacterial cold-water disease (BCWD) caused by Flavobacterium psychrophilum represents a major threat for freshwater salmonid farming worldwide. A collection of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) isogenic lines was previously produced from a French domestic population. Here, we compared BCWD resistance phenotypes using a subset of isogenic lines chosen for their contrasted susceptibilities to F. psychrophilum. We applied individual monitoring to document the infection process, including time-course quantification of bacteremia and innate immune response. Strikingly, BCWD resistance was correlated with a lower bacterial growth rate in blood. Several immune genes were expressed at higher levels in resistant fish regardless of infection: the Type II arginase (arg2), a marker for M2 macrophages involved in anti-inflammatory responses and tissue repair, and two Toll-like receptors (tlr2/tlr7), responsible for pathogen detection and inflammatory responses. This study highlights the importance of innate and intrinsic defense mechanisms in determining the outcome of F. psychrophilum infections, and illustrates that non-lethal time-course blood sampling for individual monitoring of bacteremia is a powerful tool to resolve within-host pathogen behavior in bacterial fish diseases.",

    "abstract": "The main olfactory epithelium initiates the process of odor encoding. Recent studies have demonstrated intergenerationally inherited changes in the olfactory system in response to fear conditioning, resulting in increases in olfactory receptor frequencies and altered responses to odors. We investigated changes in the morphology of the olfactory sensory epithelium in response to an aversive foot stimulus. Here, we achieve volumetric cellular resolution to demonstrate that olfactory fear conditioning increases the number of odorencoding neurons in mice that experience shock-odor conditioning (F0), as well as their offspring (F1). We provide evidence that increases in F0 were due to biased stem cell receptor choice. Thus, we reveal dynamic regulation of the main olfactory epithelium receptor composition in response to olfactory fear conditioning, providing insight into the heritability of acquired phenotypes.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=183 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/529692v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@26e092org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@61a3c8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@47db29org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1857c96_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LIOlfactory fear conditioning leads to an increase in conditioned-odor-responsive cells in parents (F0) that is heritable (F1)\nC_LIO_LIIncrease in conditioned-odor-responsive cells is sustained through at least 9 weeks of cell turnover in the main olfactory epithelium\nC_LIO_LIOlfactory fear conditioning in F0 biases neurogenesis specifically toward conditioned-odor-responsive cell fate\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Researchers often view the multi-signal quorum sensing systems of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a hierarchy, topped by the las system which acts as a master regulator. By experimentally controlling the concentration of auto-inducer signals in a signal null strain (PAO1{Delta}lasI{Delta}rhlI), we show that the two primary quorum sensing systems--las and rhl--act reciprocally rather than hierarchically. Just as the las systems 3-oxo-C12-HSL can induce increased expression of rhlI, the rhl systems C4-HSL increases the expression level of lasI. We develop a mathematical model to quantify relationships both within and between the las and rhl quorum sensing systems and the downstream genes they influence. The results show that not only do the systems interact reciprocally, but they do so cooperatively and nonlinearly, with the combination of C4-HSL and 3-oxo-C12-HSL increasing expression level far more than the sum of their individual effects. We computationally assess how our parameterized model responds to variation in social (population density) and physical (mass transfer) environment and demonstrate that a reciprocal architecture is more responsive to density and more robust to mass transfer than a strict hierarchy.",

    "abstract": "Joint analysis of multiple correlated phenotypes for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can identify and interpret pleiotropic loci which are essential to understand pleiotropy in diseases and complex traits. Meanwhile, constructing a network based on associations between phenotypes and genotypes provides a new insight to analyze multiple phenotypes, which can explore whether phenotypes and genotypes might be related to each other at a higher level of cellular and organismal organization. In this paper, we first develop a bipartite signed network by linking phenotypes and genotypes into a Genotype and Phenotype Network (GPN). The GPN can be constructed by a mixture of quantitative and qualitative phenotypes and is applicable to binary phenotypes with extremely unbalanced case-control ratios in large-scale biobank datasets. We then apply a powerful community detection method to partition phenotypes into disjoint network modules based on GPN. Finally, we jointly test the association between multiple phenotypes in a network module and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Simulations and analyses of 72 complex traits in the UK Biobank show that multiple phenotype association tests based on network modules detected by GPN are much more powerful than those without considering network modules. The newly proposed GPN provides a new insight to investigate the genetic architecture among different types of phenotypes. Multiple phenotypes association studies based on GPN are improved by incorporating the genetic information into the phenotype clustering. Notably, it might broaden the understanding of genetic architecture that exists between diagnoses, genes, and pleiotropy.",

    "abstract": "All animals must maintain genome and proteome integrity, especially when experiencing endogenous or exogenous stress. To cope, organisms have evolved sophisticated and conserved response systems: unfolded protein responses (UPRs) ensure proteostasis while DNA damage responses (DDRs) maintains genome integrity. Emerging evidence suggests that UPRs and DDRs crosstalk, but this remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that depletion of the DNA primases pri-1 or pri-2, which synthesize RNA primers at replication forks and whose inactivation causes DNA damage, activates the UPR of the endoplasmic reticulum (UPR-ER) in Caenorhabditis elegans, with especially strong activation in the germline. We observed activation of both the inositol-requiring-enzyme 1 (ire-1) and the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (pek-1) branches of the UPR-ER. Interestingly, activation of the UPR-ER output gene heat shock protein 4 (hsp-4) was partially independent of its canonical activators, ire-1 and X-box binding protein (xbp-1), and instead required the third branch of the UPR-ER, activating transcription factor 6 (atf-6), suggesting functional redundancy. We further found that primase depletion specifically induces the UPR-ER, but not the distinct cytosolic or mitochondrial UPRs, suggesting that primase inactivation causes compartment-specific rather than global stress. Functionally, loss of ire-1 or pek-1 sensitized animals to replication stress caused by hydroxyurea. Finally, transcriptome analysis of pri-1 embryos revealed several deregulated processes that could cause UPR-ER activation, including protein glycosylation, calcium signaling, and fatty acid desaturation. Together, our data show that the UPR-ER, but not other UPRs, responds to replication fork stress and that the UPR-ER is required to alleviate this stress.",

    "abstract": "Replacing fishmeal with alternative protein sources and improving new ingredients diets with feed additives are major objectives in aquaculture. The aim of this study was to evaluate benefits for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) of supplementing a fishmeal-free diet, composed of processed animal proteins, with yeast extract. Juvenile rainbow trout (initial weight 37 {+/-} 2 g) were fed either with a control diet (19% fishmeal) or with a diet based on terrestrial animal by-products (17%) supplemented or not with 3% of yeast extract. Effects of the diets were evaluated in a 4-week digestibility trial and a 12-week growth experiment. Fish health was investigated by measuring plasma immune markers and performing histological study of the gut. Underlying molecular responses were investigated using unbiased transcriptomic analysis of the liver and distal intestine. Results indicated that supplementing with 3% yeast extract did not influence nutrient digestibility substantially. Nevertheless, fish fed the supplemented fishmeal-free diet grew more than those fed the non-supplemented processed animal protein diet. Plasma and structural parameters indicated no exacerbated immune response or signs of intestinal inflammation in fish fed the fishmeal-free diets. However, plasma total immunoglobulin M levels and intestinal villi were significantly higher in fish fed the diet supplemented with yeast extract. The transcriptomic analysis revealed that the diets influenced immune, inflammatory, pathogen fighting and coagulation gene-related expressions. These results suggest that the dietary inclusion of yeast can enhance a fishmeal-free diet by improving rainbow trout performances and potentially their robustness.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmune disorders and some types of blood cancer originate when B lymphocytes malfunction. In particular, when B cells produce antibodies recognizing the bodys proteins, it leads to various autoimmune disorders. And when B cells of various developmental stages transform into cancer cells, it results in blood cancers, including multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and leukemia. Thus, new methods of targeting B cells are required for various patient groups. Here, we used protein kinase inhibitors alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, entrectinib, and lorlatinib previously approved as drugs treating anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive lung cancer cells. We hypothesized that the same inhibitors will efficiently target leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK)-positive, actively protein-secreting mature B lymphocytes, including plasma cells. We isolated CD19-positive human B cells from the blood of healthy donors and used two alternative methods to stimulate cell maturation toward plasma cells. Using cell proliferation and flow cytometry assays, we found that ceritinib and entrectinib eliminate plasma cells from B cell populations. Alectinib, brigatinib, and crizotinib also inhibited B cell proliferation, while lorlatinib had no or limited effect on B cells. More generally, we concluded that several drugs previously developed to treat ALK-positive malignant cells can be also used to treat LTK-positive B cells.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic variants in neuronal voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channel genes including SCN2A, which encodes NaV1.2, are frequently discovered in neurodevelopmental disorders with and without epilepsy. SCN2A is also a high confidence risk gene for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and nonsyndromic intellectual disability (ID). Previous work to determine the functional consequences of SCN2A variants yielded a paradigm in which predominantly gain-of-function (GoF) variants cause epilepsy whereas loss-of-function (LoF) variants are associated with ASD and ID. However, this framework is based on a limited number of functional studies conducted under heterogenous experimental conditions whereas most disease-associated SCN2A variants have not been functionally annotated. We determined the functional properties of more than 30 SCN2A variants using automated patch clamp recording to assess the analytical validity of this approach and to examine whether a binary classification of variant dysfunction is evident in a larger cohort studied under uniform conditions. We studied 28 disease-associated variants and 4 common population variants using two distinct alternatively spliced forms of NaV1.2 that were heterologously expressed in HEK293T cells. Multiple biophysical parameters were assessed on 5,858 individual cells. We found that automated patch clamp recording provided a valid high throughput method to ascertain detailed functional properties of NaV1.2 variants with concordant findings for a subset of variants that were previously studied using manual patch clamp. Additionally, many epilepsy-associated variants in our study exhibited complex patterns of gain- and loss-of-function properties that are difficult to classify overall by a simple binary scheme. The higher throughput achievable with automated patch clamp enables study of a larger number of variants, greater standardization of recording conditions, freedom from operator bias, and enhanced experimental rigor valuable for accurate assessment of NaV channel variant dysfunction. Together, this approach will enhance our ability to discern relationships between variant channel dysfunction and neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChildhood maltreatment exposure (CME) and related trauma could be considered some of psychiatrys greatest public health challenges. CME and early adversity have been associated with increased amygdala volume in exposed individuals. Emerging evidence implies that CME could also affect prenatal development of the offspring.\n\nMethodsAs part of the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study, we measured bilateral amygdala volumes from MR images in 76 healthy infants at 2-5 weeks of gestation corrected age and obtained the Trauma and Distress Scale (TADS) questionnaire from both parents. The associations between neonatal amygdala volumes and TADS scores were examined in stepwise regression models.\n\nResultsWe found that maternal CME associated positively with infant left amygdala volume (p = .045) while the positive association for the paternal trauma score was only marginally significant (p = .099). Similar associations were not observed for the right amygdala. In the exploratory analyses, we used age ranges (0-6, 7-12, and 13-18 years) as estimate of the timing of the CME and included all three time points from both parents using left amygdala volume into the stepwise regression models. We found that maternal TADS scores from 13-18 years of age associated positively with infant left amygdala volumes (p = .008). Correspondingly, paternal TADS scores from 0-6 years of age associated positively with the infant left amygdala volumes (p = .014).\n\nConclusionsOur link the infant offspring amygdala volume with parental CME with some agreement with prior findings, and they also imply links paternal CME to infant amygdala volumes. Amygdala is one of the key brain structures associated with both early life exposures and later psychiatric health, which makes it crucially important to elucidate both the underlying mechanisms and the later relevance of these associations in future studies.",

Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers targeting two separate sequences in exon 44 were created to simultaneously target two splicing regulators in exon 44, and their exon 44 skipping was measured.

    "abstract": "Epithelia are subject to diverse forms of mechanical stress during development and post-embryonic life. They possess multiple mechanisms to preserve tissue integrity against tensile forces, which characteristically involve specialized cell-cell adhesion junctions coupled to the cytoskeleton. Desmosomes connect to intermediate filaments (IF) via desmoplakin (DP) 1,2, while the E-cadherin complex links to the actomyosin cytoskeleton in adherens junctions (AJ) 3. These distinct adhesion-cytoskeleton systems support different strategies to preserve epithelial integrity, especially against tensile stress. IFs coupled to desmosomes can passively respond to tension by strain-stiffening 4-10, whereas for AJs a variety of mechanotransduction mechanisms associated with the E-cadherin apparatus itself 11,12, or proximate to the junctions 13, can modulate the activity of its associated actomyosin cytoskeleton by cell signaling. We now report a pathway where these systems collaborate for active tension-sensing and epithelial homeostasis. We found that DP was necessary for epithelia to activate RhoA at AJ on tensile stimulation, an effect that required its capacity to couple IF to desmosomes. DP exerted this effect by facilitating the association of Myosin VI with E-cadherin, the mechanosensor for the tension-sensitive RhoA pathway at AJ 12. This connection between the DP-IF system and AJ-based tension-sensing promoted epithelial resilience when contractile tension was increased. It further facilitated epithelial homeostasis by allowing apoptotic cells to be eliminated by apical extrusion. Thus, active responses to tensile stress in epithelial monolayers reflect an integrated response of the IF- and actomyosin-based cell-cell adhesion systems.",
