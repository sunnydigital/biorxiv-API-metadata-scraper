    "abstract": "Ribosome biogenesis is one of the most essential and energy-consuming cellular functions. It takes place mainly in the nucleolus. For cancer cells, the nucleolar function is especially important due to the high demand for ribosomes to support continuous proliferation. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of existing chemotherapy drugs on the nucleolar state. For this, we conducted an imaging-based screen for anticancer drugs that induce morphological re-organization consistent with nucleolar stress. For a readout, we developed a novel parameter termed \"nucleolar normality score\", which measures ratios of dense fibrillar center and granular component in the nucleolus and nucleoplasm. We show that multiple classes of drugs cause nucleolar stress, including DNA intercalators, inhibitors of mTOR/PI3K, heat shock proteins, proteasome, and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Different classes of drugs induced morphologically and molecularly distinct states of nucleolar stress. By applying phospho-proteomics and live imaging strategies, we characterized in detail the nucleolar stress induced by inhibition of transcriptional CDKs, particularly CDK9, the main CDK that targets RNA Pol II. Inhibition of CDK9 dramatically reduced rRNA production, caused dissociation of RNA Polymerase I catalytic subunit POLR1A from ribosomal DNA and dispersal of the nucleolar granular component, a stress we refer to as the \"bare scaffold\" state. We identified multiple nucleolar CDK phosphorylation substrates, including RNA Pol I - associated protein Treacle, and demonstrated that CDK9 can phosphorylate Treacle in vitro. This implies that transcriptional CDKs coordinate the action of RNA pol I and RNA pol II. Furthermore, molecular dynamics analysis of the endogenous nucleolar protein NPM1 demonstrated that CDK inhibition vastly increased its mobility, consistent with the loss of nucleolar integrity. We conclude that many classes of chemotherapy compounds directly or indirectly target nucleolar structure and function, and recommend considering this in anticancer drug development.",

    "abstract": "Annual cycles in daylength provide an initial predictive environmental cue that plants and animals use to time seasonal biology. Seasonal changes in photoperiodic information acts to entrain endogenous programs in physiology to optimize an animals fitness. Attempts to identify the neural and molecular substrates of photoperiodic time measurement in birds have, to date, focused on blunt changes in light exposure during a restricted period of photoinducibility. The objectives of these studies were first to characterise a molecular seasonal clock in Japanese quail and second, to identify the key transcripts involved in endogenously generated interval timing that underlies photosensitivity in birds. We hypothesized that the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) provides the neuroendocrine control of photoperiod-induced changes in reproductive physiology, and that the pars distalis of the pituitary gland contains an endogenous internal timer for the short photoperiod dependent development of reproductive photosensitivity. Here we report distinct seasonal waveforms of transcript expression in the MBH, and pituitary gland and discovered the patterns were not synchronized across tissues. Follicle-stimulating hormone-beta (FSHb) expression increased during the simulated spring equinox, prior to photoinduced increases in prolactin, thyrotropin-stimulating hormone-beta and testicular growth. Diurnal analyses of transcript expression showed sustained elevated levels of FSHb under conditions of the spring equinox, compared to autumnal equinox, short (<12L) and long (>12L) photoperiods. FSHb expression increased in quail held in non-stimulatory short photoperiod, indicative of the initiation of an endogenously programmed interval timer. These data identify that FSHb establishes a state of photosensitivity for the external coincidence timing of seasonal physiology. The independent regulation of FSHb expression provides an alternative pathway through which other supplementary environmental cues, such as temperature, can fine tune seasonal reproductive maturation and involution.",

    "abstract": "Compared with lowlander migrants, native Tibetans have a higher reproductive success at high altitude though the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we compared the transcriptome and histology of full-term placentas between native Tibetans and Han migrants. We found that the placental trophoblast shows the largest expression divergence between Tibetans and Han, and Tibetans show decreased immune response and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Remarkably, we detected a sex-biased expression divergence, where the male-infant placentas show a greater between-population difference than the female-infant placentas. The umbilical cord plays a key role in the sex-biased expression divergence, which is associated with the higher birth weight of the male newborns of Tibetans. We also identified adaptive histological changes in the male-infant placentas of Tibetans, including a larger umbilical cord vein area and wall thickness, and fewer syncytial knots. These findings provide valuable insights into the sex-biased adaptation of human populations, with significant implications for medical and genetic studies of human reproduction.",

    "abstract": "Non-genetic information can be inherited across generations by the process of Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance (TEI). TEI can be established by various triggering events, including transient genetic perturbations. In Drosophila, hemizygosity of the Fab-7 regulatory element triggers inheritance of the histone mark H3K27me3 at a homologous locus on another chromosome, resulting in heritable epigenetic differences in eye colour. By mutating transcription factor binding sites within the Fab-7 element, we demonstrate the importance of two proteins in the establishment and maintenance of TEI: GAGA-factor and Pleiohomeotic. We show that these proteins function by recruiting the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 and by mediating interchromosomal chromatin contacts between Fab-7 and its homologous locus. Finally, using an in vivo synthetic biology system to induce them, we show that chromatin contacts alone can establish TEI, providing a mechanism by which hemizygosity of one locus can establish epigenetic memory at another in trans through long-distance chromatin contacts.",

Using a neurodevelopmental disorder called Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf Optic Atrophy Syndrome (BBSOAS) as a genetic disease model, we applied a combined Genetic Code Expansion (GCE) and structural bioinformatics strategy to assess the pathogenic impact of several human NR2F1 variants. Nonsense mutations in the ligand binding domain (LBD) resulted in truncated proteins, while missense variants significantly affected the folding of NR2F1 monomers as well as its supramolecular complexes. The GCE-enabled covalent and site-specific capture of transient supramolecular interactions in living cells revealed the variable quaternary conformations of NR2F1 variants and pinpointed the disrupted interplay with dimeric partners and the newly identified cofactor, CRABP2, while the computational analyses of the NR2F1 structure delineated the molecular basis of the impact of the variants on the isolated and complexed structures. The revealed consequence of the pathogenic mutations on the conformation, supramolecular interplay, and alterations in the cell cycle, viability, and subcellular localization of the different variants reflect the heterogeneous disease spectrum and establish the foundation for further understanding the complexity of BBSOAS.",

    "abstract": "Mosquito transmitted viruses are responsible for an increasing burden of human disease. Despite this, little is known about the diversity and ecology of viruses within individual mosquito hosts. Using a meta-transcriptomic approach, we analysed the virome of 2,438 individual mosquitos (79 species), spanning [~]4000 km along latitudes and longitudes in China. From these data we identified 393 core viral species associated with mosquitos, including seven (putative) arbovirus species. We identified potential species and geographic hotspots of viral richness and arbovirus occurrence, and demonstrated that host phylogeny had a strong impact on the composition of individual mosquito viromes. Our data revealed a large number of viruses shared among mosquito species or genera, expanding our knowledge of host specificity of insect-associated viruses. We also detected multiple virus species that were widespread throughout the country, possibly facilitated by long-distance mosquito migrations. Together, our results greatly expand the known mosquito virome, linked the viral diversity at the scale of individual insects to that at a country-wide scale, and offered unique insights into the ecology of viruses of insect vectors.",

    "abstract": "Molybdenum (Mo)-dependent biochemistry is essential for many key metabolic pathways. However, theory and geological evidence suggests that its solubility during long intervals with low dioxygen would have limited its availability on early Earth. We developed models of metabolic evolution and found that reactions employing tungsten (W)-dependent biochemistry likely preceded Mo-dependent reactions, where Mo-usage increased dramatically after the production of dioxygen. Consistent with this finding, we analyzed genomes from over 65,000 phylogenetically diverse microbes and metagenomes from an environmental dataset, and we observed that dioxygen-utilizing prokaryotes living in aerobic niches are enriched with Mo-dependent enzymes as compared to anaerobic microbes. As an independent evaluation of this hypothesis, we combined protein language models, machine learning, and phylogenomic analysis to build a classifier for W- or Mo-pterin dependence in the DMSO reductase superfamily, and we found that W-pterin-dependent enzymes cluster near the root of the tree and that a subset of late-evolving aldehyde oxidoreductases (AORs) from aerobes are predicted to rely on Mo instead of W. Overall, our combination of metabolic modeling, phenotypic analysis, machine learning, and phylogenomic analysis suggest that Mo-pterin-dependent biochemistry likely derived from W-pterin-dependent biochemistry, and that Mo-usage increased drastically after the rise of oxygen.",

Protein structures play a vital role in facilitating this interpretation by providing functional context to genetic coding variants. However, mapping genes to proteins is a tedious and error-prone task due to inconsistencies in data formats. Over the past two decades, numerous tools and databases have been developed to automatically map annotated positions and variants to protein structures. However, most of these tools are web-based and not well-suited for large-scale genomic data analysis. To address this issue, we introduce 3Dmapper, a standalone command-line tool developed in Python and R.

In stem cell and developmental biology snap-shot data allows us to characterise how the transcriptional state of cells changes between successive cell types. Here we show how approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) can be employed to calibrate mathematical models against single cell data. In our simulation study we demonstrate the pivotal role of the adequate choice of distance measures appropriate for single cell data. We show that for good distance measures, notably optimal transport distances, we can infer parameters for mathematical models from simulated single cell data. We show that the ABC posteriors can be used to characterise parameter sensitivity and identify dependencies between different parameters, and to infer representations of the Waddington or epigenetic landscape, which forms a popular and interpretable representation of the developmental dynamics. In summary, these results pave the way for fitting mechanistic models of stem cell differentiation to single cell data.",

To date, multiple sensory alterations related to aging have been identified, including morphological and functional changes in inner hair cochlear cells, photoreceptors, and retinal ganglion cells. While some age-related morphological changes are known to occur in rod bipolar cells in the retina, their effect on these cells and on their connection to other cells via ribbon synapses remain elusive. To investigate the effects of aging on rod bipolar cells and their ribbon synapses, we compared synap-tic calcium currents, calcium dynamics, and exocytosis in zebrafish (Danio rerio) that were mid-dle-aged (MA,18 months) or old-aged (OA, 36 months). The bipolar cell terminal in OA zebrafish exhibited a decreased number of synaptic ribbons, an increased ribbon length, and a decrease in local Ca2+ signals at the tested ribbon location with little change in the overall magnitude of the calcium current or exocytosis in response to brief pulses. Staining of the synaptic ribbons with antibodies specific for PKC-alpha revealed shortening of the inner nuclear and plexiform layers (INL and IPL). These findings shed light on age-related changes in the retina that are related to synaptic ribbons and calcium signals.",

    "abstract": "Neurogenesis and proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) are controlled by both intrinsic molecular pathways and extrinsic signaling cues, including neural circuits. One such circuit, the ACC-subep-ChAT+ circuit, has been identified as a regulator of ventral SVZ neurogenesis by modulating the proliferation of LV NSCs. However, the specific neural signals that promote the proliferation activity of LV NSCs have remained largely unknown. In this study, we uncover a molecular mechanism underlying the cellular activation and proliferation of quiescent NSCs (qNSCs) in the lateral ventricle SVZ (LV-SVZ) mediated by the cortical circuit. Our findings demonstrate that postnatal and adult LV qNSCs are triggered by the cortical circuit through ChAT+ neuron stimulation, consequently resulting in the activation of muscarinic 3 receptors (M3) expressed on LV qNSCs. This, in turn, triggers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1) activation, causing intracellular calcium release. Subsequently, the proliferation of LV qNSCs occurs through the downstream regulation of the calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II delta (CAMK2D) and the MAPK10 signaling pathway. These findings shed light on the molecular regulatory mechanisms that govern LV qNSCs and emphasize the significant role of the cortical circuit in promoting their proliferative activation within the ventral LV-SVZ.",

Molecular, ultrastructural and functional studies further establish shared hybrid identity of pc-Ss in mouse, and reveal their morphological adaptations and ability to perform lymphatic-like function in draining high molecular weight tracers. Interestingly, we found that inhibition of the key lymphangiogenic growth factor VEGF-C did not block the development of pc-Ss in mice, distinguishing them from other lymphatic and hybrid vessels analyzed so far.

Methods: PMH, isolated by collagenase-perfused mouse liver (C57B6/J; 18-23 weeks), were cultured overnight in Williams E-medium supplemented with 2% FBS, L-glutamine, and hepatocyte growth supplements. HepOrgs were developed by culturing cells in a 3D matrix for two weeks. The senescence was induced by DNA damage (doxorubicin, cisplatin, and etoposide), oxidative stress (H2O2, and ethanol), and telomere inhibition (BIBR-1532), p53 activation (nutlin-3a), DNA methyl transferase inhibition (5-azacitidine), and metabolism inhibitors (galactosamine and hydroxyurea). SA-{beta} galactosidase activity, immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and cellular bioenergetics were used to assess the senescence phenotype. Results: Each senescence inducer triggers a unique combination of senescence markers in hepatocytes. All senescence inducers, except hydroxyurea and ethanol, increased SA-beta galactosidase activity, the most commonly used marker for cellular senescence. Among the SASP factors, CCL2 and IL-10 were consistently upregulated, while Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 exhibited global downregulation across all modes of senescence. Notably, DNA damage response was activated by DNA damage inducers. Cell cycle markers were most significantly reduced by doxorubicin, cisplatin, and galactosamine. Additionally, DNA damage-induced senescence shifted cellular bioenergetics capacity from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation. Conclusion: In our study, we demonstrated that each senescence inducer activates a unique combination of senescence markers in PMH. Doxorubicin demonstrated the highest efficacy in inducing senescence, followed by cisplatin and H2O2, with no impact on apoptosis. Each inducer prompted DNA damage response and mitochondrial dysfunction, independent of MAPK/AKT.",

    "abstract": "Tricellular junctions (TCJs) provide essential adhesive and occluding functions at epithelial cell vertices and play key roles for tissue integrity and physiology, but how TCJs are assembled and maintained is poorly understood. In Drosophila, the transmembrane proteins Anakonda (Aka), Gliotactin (Gli), and M6 constitute tricellular occluding junctions. Aka and M6 localize in an interdependent manner to vertices and are required jointly to localize Gli, but how these proteins interact to assemble TCJs was not known. Here, we show that the tetraspan proteolipid protein M6 physically interacts with Aka and with itself. M6 is palmitoylated on a conserved juxta-membrane cysteine cluster. This modification promotes efficient vertex localization of M6 and binding to Aka, but not to itself, and becomes essential when TCJ protein levels are reduced. Abolishing M6 palmitoylation leads to delayed accumulation of M6 and Aka at vertices but does not affect the rate of TCJ growth or mobility of M6 or Aka. Our findings suggest that palmitoylation-dependent recruitment of Aka by M6 promotes initiation of TCJ assembly, while subsequent TCJ growth relies on different mechanisms independent of M6 palmitoylation.",

Traditionally, glycosylated transmembrane proteins were thought to be the major constituents of the external surface of the plasma membrane. Here, we provide evidence that a group of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are present on the surface of living cells. These cell surface RBPs (csRBPs) precisely organize into well-defined nanoclusters that are enriched for multiple RBPs, glycoRNAs, and their clustering can be disrupted by extracellular RNase addition. These glycoRNA-csRBP clusters further serve as sites of cell surface interaction for the cell penetrating peptide TAT. Removal of RNA from the cell surface, or loss of RNA binding activity by TAT, causes defects in TAT cell internalization. Together, we provide evidence of an expanded view of the cell surface by positioning glycoRNA-csRBP clusters as a regulator of communication between cells and the extracellular environment.",

Nucleosomes with little H1 and linker DNA density were distributed randomly without any spatial preference.

    "abstract": "It is widely believed that tissue mechanical properties, determined mainly by the extracellular matrix (ECM), are actively maintained. However, despite its broad importance to biology and medicine, tissue mechanical homeostasis is poorly understood. To explore this hypothesis, we developed mutations in the mechanosensitive protein talin1 that alter cellular sensing of ECM stiffness. Mutation of a novel mechanosensitive site between talin1 rod domain helix bundles 1 and 2 (R1 and R2) shifted cellular stiffness sensing curves, enabling cells to spread and exert tension on compliant substrates. Opening of the R1-R2 interface promotes binding of the ARP2/3 complex subunit ARPC5L, which mediates the altered stiffness sensing. Ascending aortas from mice bearing these mutations show increased compliance, less fibrillar collagen, and rupture at lower pressure. Together, these results demonstrate that cellular stiffness sensing regulates ECM mechanical properties. These data thus directly support the mechanical homeostasis hypothesis and identify a novel mechanosensitive interaction within talin that contributes to this mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Polymeric IgMs are secreted from plasma cells abundantly despite their structural complexity and intricate multimerization steps. To gain new insights into IgMs assembly mechanics that underwrite the high-level secretion, we characterized the biosynthetic process of a natural human IgM, SAM-6, using a recombinant HEK293 cell system. By creating a series of mutant subunits that differentially disrupt specific sets of inter-chain disulfide bonds, we assessed their effects on various aspects of IgM biosynthesis in 48 different mutant subunit combinations. The analysis included the visualization of intracellular biosynthetic events such as steady-state subcellular subunit distribution, secretory trafficking bottlenecks, and the ER-associated Russell body formation by fluorescent microscopy. We also characterized various extracellular events including secreted IgM product quality, secretion output, and the release of various assembly intermediates using biochemical and biophysical assays. In this combinatorial mutagenesis approach, we unexpectedly found that the loss of multiple inter-chain disulfide bonds, including the one between HC and {lambda}LC subunits, was tolerated in polymeric IgM formation and secretion. This finding revealed the vital role of underlying non-covalent protein-protein association not only during the orchestration of initial subunit interactions but also in maintaining the polymeric IgM product integrity during ER quality control steps, secretory pathway trafficking, and secretion. We suggest that the IgM assembly process is inherently robust and has a stopgap that permits the secretion of polymeric IgM even when not all the prescribed inter-chain disulfide bonds are formed. This study holistically presents the requirements and exemptions in polymeric IgM biosynthesis by encompassing the characterization of intracellular and extracellular events and the roles of covalent and non-covalent interactions. These findings can guide antibody engineering strategy when designing IgM-based multivalent modalities.",

Vertebrate Spalt proteins have been mostly associated to the organization of heterochromatic regions, but they also contribute regulatory functions through binding to A/T rich motives present in their target genes. The developmental processes in which the Drosophila spalt genes participate are well known through genetic analysis, but the mechanism by which the Spalt proteins regulate transcription are still unknown. Furthermore, despite the prominent changes in gene expression associated to mutations in the spalt genes, the specific DNA sequences they bind are also unknow. In this contribution we describe the analysis of a DNA fragment present in the regulatory region of the knirps gene. Spalt proteins are candidate repressors of knirps expression during the formation of the venation pattern in the wing disc, and here we identify a minimal conserved 30bp sequence that binds to Spalt major both in vivo and in vitro. This sequence mediates transcriptional repression in the central region of the wing blade, constituting the first confirmed case of a direct regulatory interaction between Spalt major and its target DNA in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "We previously modeled elimination of aneuploid cells in mouse embryos using the Mps1 inhibitor reversine. Here, we develop an alternative model using AZ3146, a highly specific Mps1 inhibitor, to understand survival of mosaic embryos. AZ3146 treated embryos overexpress Hypoxia-Inducible-Factor-1A(HIF1A), inhibition of which results in a decreased cell number of extra-embryonic trophectoderm but not embryonic epiblast. Hypoxia reduces the levels of DNA damage after either AZ3146 or reversine treatment, inferring a role of HIF1A in DNA repair. To analyze cell competition, we generated aggregation chimeras of DMSO-AZ3146-treated cells (low mosaics) and reversine-AZ3146-treated cells (medium mosaics). Both mosaic chimeras have similar number of cells at the blastocyst stage. However, diploid cells contribute preferentially to epiblast in low mosaics whereas AZ3146-treated cells outcompete reversine-treated cells in all the lineages in medium mosaics. Consistent with its proposed role in aneuploid survival, HIF1A downregulation in chimeras reduces the number of aneuploid cells and favors development of diploid cells. Our data indicate that diploid cells contribute preferentially to the epiblast and survival of aneuploid extra-embryonic cells is promoted by HIF1A.",

    "abstract": "Background: Wnt signaling pathways play crucial roles in animal development. They establish embryonic axes, specify cell fates, and regulate tissue morphogenesis from the early embryo to organogenesis. It is becoming increasingly recognized that these distinct developmental outcomes depend upon dynamic interactions between multiple ligands, receptors, antagonists, and other pathway modulators, consolidating the view that a combinatorial \"code\" controls the output of Wnt signaling. However, due to the lack of comprehensive analyses of Wnt components in several animal groups, it remains unclear if specific combinations always give rise to specific outcomes, and if these combinatorial patterns are conserved throughout evolution. Results: In this work, we investigate the combinatorial expression of Wnt signaling components during the axial patterning of the brachiopod Terebratalia transversa. We find that T. transversa has a conserved repertoire of ligands, receptors, and antagonists. These genes are expressed throughout embryogenesis but undergo significant upregulation during axial elongation. At this stage, Frizzled domains occupy broad regions across the body while Wnt domains are narrower and distributed in partially overlapping patches; antagonists are mostly restricted to the anterior end. Based on their combinatorial expression, we identify a series of unique transcriptional subregions along the anteroposterior axis that coincide with the different morphological subdivisions of the brachiopod larval body. When comparing these data across the animal phylogeny, we find that the expression of Frizzled genes is relatively conserved, whereas the expression of Wnt genes is more variable. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the differential activation of Wnt signaling pathways may play a role in regionalizing the anteroposterior axis of brachiopod larvae. More generally, our analyses suggest that changes in the receptor context of Wnt ligands may act as a mechanism for the evolution and diversification of the body axis of bilaterians.",

    "abstract": "Central to our understanding of how visual evoked potentials (VEPs) contribute to visual processing is the question of where their anatomical sources are. Three well-established measures of low-level visual cortical activity are widely used: the first component (\"C1\") of the transient and multifocal VEP, and the steady-state VEP (SSVEP). Although primary visual cortex (V1) activity has often been implicated in the generation of all three signals, their dominant sources remain uncertain due to the limited resolution and methodological heterogeneity of source modelling. Here, we provide the first characterisation of all three signals in one analytic framework centred on the 'cruciform model', which describes how scalp topographies of V1 activity vary with stimulus location due to the retinotopy and unique folding pattern of V1. We measured the transient C1, multifocal C1, and SSVEPs driven by an 18.75Hz and 7.5Hz flicker, and regressed them against forward-models of areas V1, V2 and V3 generated from the Benson-2014 retinotopy atlas. The topographic variations of all four VEP signals across the visual field were better captured by V1 models, explaining between 2-6 times more variance than V2/V3. Models with all three visual areas improved fit further, but complementary analyses of temporal dynamics across all three signals indicated that the bulk of extrastriate contributions occur considerably later than V1. Overall, our data support the use of peak C1 amplitude and SSVEPs to probe V1 activity, although the SSVEP contains stronger extrastriate contributions. Moreover, we provide elaborated heuristics to distinguish visual areas in VEP data based on signal lateralization as well as polarity inversion.",

ZmSTOP1-A, a STOP1-like protein from maize (Zea mays), was localized to the nucleus and had transactivation activity. ZmSTOP1-A was expressed moderately in both roots and shoots of maize seedlings, but was not induced by Al stress or low pH. Overexpression of ZmSTOP1-A in Arabidopsis Atstop1 mutant partially restored Al tolerance and completely low pH tolerance with respect to root growth. Regarding Al tolerance, ZmSTOP1-A/Atstop1 plants showed clear upregulation of organic acid transporter genes, and leading to increased organic acid secretion and reduced Al accumulation in roots. Besides, the antioxidant enzyme activity in roots and shoots of ZmSTOP1-A/Atstop1 plants was significantly enhanced, ultimately alleviating Al toxicity via scavenging reactive oxygen species. Similarly, ZmSTOP1-A could directly activate ZmMATE1 expression in maize, positively correlated with the number of Al-responsive GGNVS cis-element in the ZmMATE1 promoter. Our results revealed that ZmSTOP1-A antagonizes Al toxicity by enhancing organic acid secretion and reactive oxygen species scavenging in Arabidopsis, demonstrating that it is an important transcription factor conferring Al tolerance.

However, the link between a trait and its contribution to a particular aspect of fitness is not always straight-forward. We investigated phylogenetic and functional diversity for bird communities along a 200-2800 m elevational transect in the eastern Himalayas. We hypothesized that beta traits, associated with environmental tolerances, would exhibit a directional change in mean values, while alpha traits, linked to competitive strategies, would show a decrease in dispersion with elevation. Our findings showed that most functional traits exhibited a decrease in dispersion with elevation. However, surprisingly, the mean values of these traits also exhibited a significant relationship with elevation, suggesting their involvement in both competitive and environmental fitness. Furthermore, we observed that morphological traits, traditionally considered beta traits associated with environmental tolerance, were influenced more strongly by resource availability and habitat structure rather than aspects of temperature or air density. These results challenge the simplistic classification of traits as either alpha or beta. We suggest that future studies should carefully analyze the variation in mean values and dispersion of individual traits before assigning them solely to a particular category of fitness. The results contribute to a broader understanding of the complex interactions between functional traits, fitness, and environmental conditions in Himalayan bird communities.",

The depletion of an RPA subunit, Rfa1, in a recombination-defective dmc1 mutant, fully alleviates the pachytene arrest with the persistent unrepaired DSBs. RPA depletion downregulates a meiosis-specific CHK2 homolog, Mek1, which in turn activates Ndt80 transcriptional activator for pachytene exit. These support the idea that RPA is a sensor of ssDNAs for the activation of meiotic DDR. Rfa1 depletion also accelerates the prophase I delay induced by the zip1 mutant defective in both chromosome synapsis and the recombination, suggesting that the accumulation of ssDNAs rather than defective synapsis triggers prophase I relay in the zip1 mutant.",

Image-based measures of elastography (e.g., strain, stiffness) may provide an ideal assessment of disc function that is lost in the pathogenesis of degeneration, but unfortunately remains underdeveloped. Moreover, it is unknown whether strain or stiffness of the disc may be predicted by MRI relaxometry (e.g. T1 or T2), an increasingly accepted quantitative measure of disc structure. In this study, we utilized a workflow to quantify T1 and T2 relaxation times and in-plane strains using displacement-encoded MRI within the disc; furthermore, we calculated patterns of shear modulus under physiologically relevant levels of compression and bending and in orthogonal image planes. We found that intratissue strain depended on the loading mode, and shear modulus in the nucleus pulposus was typically an order of magnitude lower than the annulus fibrosis, except in bending, where the apparent stiffness depended on the loading. However, the shear modulus did not correlate well with structural measures of relaxometry in all regions of the disc. Estimations of relative shear modulus from strain data derived under compression did not correspond with those derived from bending experiments, with no correlations in any of the 15 regions examined in the sagittal plane and only 4 of 15 correlated positively in the coronal plane. These results suggest future work in inverse models that incorporate data from multiple loading conditions. Functional imaging and strain-based estimation of material properties such as shear modulus may serve as imaging biomarkers to predict relaxometry in the healthy and diseased joint. Additionally, image-based elastography and relaxometry may be viewed as complementary measures of disc structure and function to assess degeneration in longitudinal studies.",

    "abstract": "This paper aimed to investigate the predictive power of combining demographic, socioeconomic, and genetic factors with a brain MRI-based quantified measure of accelerated brain aging (referred to as deltaAGE) for neurocognitive outcomes in adolescents and young adults with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD). Our hypothesis posited that including the brain age biomarker (deltaAGE) would enhance neurocognitive outcome predictions compared to models excluding it. We conducted comprehensive analyses, including leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-group-out cross-validation techniques. Our results demonstrated that the inclusion of deltaAGE consistently improved prediction performance when considering the Pearson correlation coefficient, a preferable metric for this study. Notably, the deltaAGE-augmented models consistently outperformed those without deltaAGE across all cross-validation setups, and these correlations were statistically significant (p-value < 0.05). Therefore, our hypothesis that incorporating the brain-age biomarker alongside demographic, socioeconomic, and genetic factors enhances neurocognitive outcome predictions in adolescents and young adults with CHD is supported by the findings.",

    "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cell mutations can result in clonal hematopoiesis (CH) but the clinical outcomes are heterogeneous. The nature of the founder mutation and secondary mutations likely drive emergent neoplastic disease. We investigated how the state of the cell of origin where the Tet2 mutation occurs affects susceptibility to that commonly occurring CH mutation. Here, we provide evidence that risk is written in the epigenome of the cell of origin. By characterizing cell states that underlie myeloid differentiation and linking this information to an inducible system to assess myeloid progenitor clones, we provide evidence that epigenetic markers of the cell where Tet2 mutation occurs stratifies clonal behaviors. Specifically, Sox4 fosters a global cell state of high sensitization towards Tet2 KO. Using GMP and primary HSC models, we show that Sox4 promotes cell dedifferentiation, alters cell metabolism and increases the in vivo clonal output of mutant cells. Our results validate the hypothesis that epigenetic features can predispose specific clones for dominance and explain why an identical mutation can result in different outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Translocation renal cell carcinoma (tRCC) is a rare, aggressive type of kidney cancer primarily occurring in children. They are genetically defined by translocations involving MiT/TFE gene family members, TFE3 or, in rare cases, TFEB. The biology underlying tRCC development remains poorly understood, partly due to the lack of representative experimental models. Here, we utilized human kidney organoids, or tubuloids, to engineer a tRCC model by expression of one of the most common MiT/TFE fusions, SFPQ-TFE3. Fusion expressing tubuloids adopt a tRCC-like phenotype and gene expression signature in vitro and grow as clear cell RCC upon xenotransplantation in mice. Genome-wide binding analysis reveals that SFPQ-TFE3 reprograms gene expression signatures by aberrant, gain-of-function genome-wide DNA binding. Combining these analyses with single-cell mRNA readouts reveals an epithelium-to-mesenchymal differentiation trajectory underlying tRCC transformation, potentially caused by deregulated Wnt signaling. Our study demonstrates that SFPQ-TFE3 expression is sufficient to transform kidney epithelial cells into tRCC and defines the trajectories underlying malignant transformation, thereby facilitating the development of new therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Identification of biological modulators of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) initiation and progression are of critical importance as it remains one of the deadliest cancers. We have previously shown that ID1 and ID3 are highly expressed in human PDAC and function to repress expression of E47 target genes involved in acinar cell differentiation and quiescence. More recently, mining of large bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets has associated high expression of ID1 with poor PDAC patient survival. Here, we report that BMP2 signaling in human PDAC cells upregulates expression of ID1 and ID3 while treatment with Noggin, an endogenous BMP antagonist, or with DMH1, a selective inhibitor of the BMP receptor, ALK2, reduced expression of ID1/ID3. BMP signaling, working via the canonical pathway involving phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/9 (pSMAD1/5/9), was increased by exogenous BMP2 but blocked by DMH1. Based on immunohistochemical and scRNA-seq analyses, upregulation of BMP signaling and ID1/ID3 also occurs in murine models of pre-neoplastic lesions (KC mice) and pancreatitis induced by the cholecystokinin analog caerulein. Moreover, we demonstrate that BMP dependent ID1/ID3 expression occurs in a non-transformed human ductal cell line. Strikingly, even short term caerulein treatment promoted BMP signaling and ID1/ID3 expression in a rat exocrine cell line, consistent with a direct link between inflammation of the exocrine pancreas and BMP/ID signaling. Together, the data suggest that BMP signaling through pSMAD1/5/9 to ID1 and ID3 occurs early in pancreas pathogenesis and that pancreatic cancer cells remain addicted to this important signaling circuit. Future exploration of druggable targets within this pathway could be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment of pancreatitis and PDAC.",

Finally, in human ccRCC biospecimens, higher SLC1A1 expression is associated with metastatic disease and clusters with elevated expression of other solute carriers, but not HIF/Hypoxia pathways.

In this study, using a digital spatial profiling approach, we characterized the gene expression profiles of the tumor and alpha-SMA positive stromal cell compartments in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PanNET) tissues. Methods The profiling was performed in tissues from eight retrospective cases (Three Grade 1, four Grade 2, and one Grade 3) where the segmentation was done based on tissue morphology and synaptophysin (tumor), alpha-SMA (stroma) marker expression. Results The stromal cell-associated genes were mainly involved in pathways of extracellular matrix modification, while in tumor cells, the gene expression profiles were primarily associated with the pathways involved in cell proliferation. The comparison of gene expression profiles across all three PanNET grades revealed that heterogeneity is not only present within the tumor but also in the alpha-SMA positive stromal cells. Furthermore, the comparison of tumor cells adjacent versus non-adjacent to -SMA positive stromal cells revealed an upregulation of MMP9 in G3 tumor analysis.

    "abstract": "A major obstacle in improving survival in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is understanding how to predict and treat leukemia relapse in the CNS. Leukemia cells are capable of infiltrating and residing within the CNS, where they interact with the microenvironment and remain sheltered from systemic treatment. These cells can survive in the CNS niche, by hijacking the microenvironment and disrupting normal functions, thus promoting malignant transformation. While the protective effects of the bone marrow niche have been widely studied, the mechanisms behind leukemia infiltration into the CNS and the role of the CNS niche in leukemia cell survival remain unknown. We have identified a dysregulated gene expression profile in CNS infiltrated T-ALL and CNS relapse, promoting cell survival, chemoresistance and disease progression. Furthermore, we discovered that interactions between leukemia cells and CNS microenvironment induce epigenetic alterations, such as changes in gene regulation and histone modifications, including H3K36me3 levels. These findings can be utilized to predict CNS infiltration and CNS relapse, therefore avoiding overtreatment and adverse effects caused by CNS directed therapy. Additionally, the identified genetic drivers of disease progression can serve as a first step towards identifying therapeutic targets, to sensitize the CNS niche to current therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pancreatitis is a long-term inflammatory disease that results in irreversible scarring and a reduction in pancreatic function. This disease has multifactorial origins, involving both behavioral risks like diet, alcohol, and smoking, as well as genetic predispositions. One gene that has been implicated is CLDN2, which encodes claudin-2, a paracellular cation-selective channel localized at tight junctions. However, if and how claudin-2 may modify pancreatitis susceptibility have not been explored. We aimed to clarify the potential role of claudin-2 in the onset and progression of pancreatitis. We employed multiple methodologies, including examining human pancreatic tissue, using the caerulein-induced experimental pancreatitis model, along with normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cell based organoid transport studies. In both human chronic pancreatitis tissues and in caerulein-induced experimental pancreatitis model, claudin-2 protein is significantly upregulated in pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. Genetically modified mice that lack claudin-2 expression develop more severe experimental pancreatitis, indicating claudin-2 plays a protective role in pancreatitis development. Our organoid based studies further demonstrate claudin-2 is critical for both sodium-dependent water transport and cAMP-dependent fluid secretion in pancreatic ductal epithelium. These findings suggest that intact claudin-2 function is essential for homeostatic and induced fluid transport, which could reduce pancreatitis severity by affecting pancreatic ductal secretion. In conclusion, our studies suggest claudin-2 upregulation during pancreatitis may play a protective role for disease development and decreased claudin-2 function may increase pancreatitis severity. This points to the possibility of modulating pancreatic ductal claudin-2 function as an approach for pancreatitis therapy.",

Current treatment options are limited and better therapies for affected individuals are urgently needed. No systematic, detailed analyses exist of the effects of glucagon like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists in the treatment of lipoatrophic diabetes. Here we examined the effects of the GLP-1R agonist liraglutide in seipin knockout mice, a pre-clinical model of generalised lipodystrophy. Acute liraglutide treatment of seipin knockout mice significantly improved insulin, glucose and pyruvate tolerance. Once-daily injection of seipin knockout mice with liraglutide for 14 days led to a modest reduction in food intake but significant improvements in hepatomegaly associated with steatosis and significantly reduced markers of liver fibrosis. Detailed examination of the pancreas revealed that liraglutide enhanced insulin secretion in response to glucose challenge with concomitantly improved glucose control. Thus, GLP-1R agonist liraglutide significantly improved multiple aspects of lipoatrophic diabetes and hepatic steatosis in mice with congenital generalised lipodystrophy. This provides important insights regarding the benefits of GLP-1R agonists for treating lipodystrophy, informing more widespread use to improve the health of individuals with this condition.",

Recent research underscores the significance of integration of intero-exteroceptive information to construct representations of our embodied self. This raises the intriguing hypothesis that interoceptive processing might be involved in the spatial image transformation of our self-body. To test this hypothesis, the present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity during an arm laterality judgment (ALJ) task. In this task, participants were tasked with discerning whether the outstretched arm of a human figure, viewed from the front or back, was the right or left hand. The reaction times for the ALJ task proved longer when the stimulus presented orientations of 0{degrees}, 90{degrees}, and 270{degrees} relative to the upright orientation, and when the front view presented as compared to the back view. Corresponding to the increased reaction time, increased brain activity was manifested in a cluster centered on the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Furthermore, this cluster of brain activity exhibited overlap with regions where the difference in activation between the front and back views positively correlated with the participants' interoceptive sensitivity, as assessed through the heartbeat detection task, within the pregenual ACC. These results suggest that the ACC plays an important role in integrating intero-exteroceptive cues for the purpose of spatially transforming the image of our self-body.",

    "abstract": "Background: Anthracycline chemotherapy is associated with a risk of cardiotoxicity leading to heart disease, particularly in pediatric cancer patients. Gold standard methods of detecting cardiotoxicity are insufficiently sensitive to early damage and specific pathophysiologies driving disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) couples anatomical resolution with biochemical mechanistic selectivity and potentially addresses the current diagnostic limitations in cardio-oncology. We aimed to validate PET imaging biomarkers targeting fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP), Translocator protein (TSPO), and norepinephrine receptor (NET) for detection of incipient anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Methods: Cardiotoxicity was established in male C57BL/6J mice by a cumulative dose of 24 mg/kg doxorubicin (DOX) over 2 weeks. DOX mice and their age-matched controls were imaged with echocardiography and PET, using [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04, [18F]DPA-714, and [18F]MFBG, over 12 weeks. Fractional shortening (FS) was determined from the echocardiograms, and cardiac uptake of the radioligands was quantified from the PET images. Heart sections were collected and used for the analysis of bulk RNA-seq, RT-qPCR, Western blot, in situ hybridization (ISH), and histopathological analysis. Results: DOX mice exhibited cardiotoxicity and cardiac atrophy. Cardiac [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET signal was significantly higher in DOX mice from 2 weeks through the study endpoint. By contrast, no cardiac dysfunction was evident by echocardiography until 10 weeks, at which point FS was significantly reduced in DOX mice. There were no differences in [18F]DPA-714 and [18F]MFBG signals. Transcription and translation of FAP, but not TSPO or NET, was detected in cardiomyocytes and were elevated in the DOX hearts, in agreement with the PET data. Genes related to cell adhesion and extracellular remodeling were significantly upregulated in the DOX mice relative to controls. Conclusions: FAP is a sensitive and selective imaging biomarker for incipient cardiotoxicity and FAPI PET is a promising non-invasive imaging tool for identifying patients at risk of cardiotoxicity during or after anthracycline chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is the most frequent extracranial pediatric tumor that leads to 15% of all cancer-related deaths in children. Tumor relapse and therapy resistance in neuroblastoma is driven by phenotypic plasticity and heterogeneity between noradrenergic (NOR) and mesenchymal (MES) cell-states. However, the dynamics and molecular patterns associated with these bidirectional cell-state transitions remain relatively poorly understood. Here, we analyze multiple RNA-seq datasets both at bulk and single-cell levels, in terms of association between NOR- and MES-specific factors. We observed that NOR-specific and MES-specific expression patterns are largely mutually exclusive, exhibiting a 'teams-like' behavior among the genes involved, reminiscent of our earlier observations in small cell lung cancer and melanoma. This antagonism was noticed also in the association of NOR and MES phenotypes with metabolic reprogramming axes and with immunotherapy relevant pathways involving PD-L1 and GD2, and in experimental perturbations driving the NOR-MES and/or MES-NOR transition. Further, this 'teams-like' patterns was seen only among the NOR- and MES-specific genes, but not in housekeeping genes, thus highlighting a hallmark of network topology enabling cancer cell plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence has implicated the RNA m6A methylation catalyzed by METTL3 in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes, including tumorigenesis. The detailed m6A landscape and molecular mechanism of METTL3 in prostate cancer (PCa) remains ill-defined. We find that METTL3 is overexpressed in PCa and correlates with worse patient survival. Functional studies establish METTL3 as an oncoprotein dependent on its m6A enzymatic activity in both AR+ and AR- PCa cells. To dissect the regulatory network of m6A pathway in PCa, we map the m6A landscape in clinical tumor samples using m6A-seq and identify genome-wide METTL3-binding transcripts via RIP-seq. Mechanistically, we discover RRBP1 as a direct METTL3 target in which METTL3 stabilizes RRBP1 mRNA in an m6A-dependent manner. RRBP1 positively correlates with METTL3 expression in PCa cohorts and exerts an oncogenic role in aggressive PCa cells. Leveraging the 3D structural protein-protein interaction between METTL3 and METTL14, we successfully develop two potential METTL3 peptide inhibitors (RM3 and RSM3) that effectively suppress cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Collectively, our study reveals a novel METTL3/m6A/RRBP1 axis in enhancing aggressive traits of PCa, which can be therapeutically targeted by small-peptide METTL3 antagonists.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer aggressiveness, providing genetic plasticity and tumor heterogeneity that allows the tumor to evolve and adapt to stress conditions. CIN is considered a cancer therapeutic biomarker because healthy cells do not exhibit CIN. Despite recent efforts to identify therapeutic strategies related to CIN, the results obtained have been very limited. CIN is characterized by a genetic signature where a collection of genes, mostly mitotic regulators, are overexpressed in CIN-positive tumors, providing aggressiveness and poor prognosis. We attempted to identify new therapeutic strategies related to CIN genes by performing a drug screen, using cells that individually express CIN-associated genes in an inducible manner. We find that the overexpression of TPX2 enhances sensitivity to the SRC inhibitor dasatinib due to activation of the YAP pathway. Furthermore, using breast cancer data from the TCGA and a cohort of cancer-derived patient samples, we find that both TPX2 expression and YAP activation are present in a significant percentage of cancer tumor samples, providing poor prognosis, being therefore putative biomarkers for dasatinib therapy.",

    "abstract": "In vivo, brain imaging poses several challenges due to the complexity of brain tissue and the requirements for effective and safe imaging. In this manuscript, we reported on developing a new fluorescent dye, Cy5-PEG2, that can selectively accumulate in mitochondria, allowing us to visualize these organelles in different cell lines. Its versatility makes it broadly applicable in various experimental conditions, including monitoring mi-tochondrial dynamics in living cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that the Cy5-PEG2 dye could penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB), making it a promising tool for in vivo brain imaging. We further examined the re-sponse of glial cells in the hippocampus and neocortex regions of the brain through biomarkers GFAP and Iba1 but found no significant increase in their expression levels. This indicates that Cy5-PEG2 dye had no noticea-ble adverse effects on the brain\\'s immune response or neuronal health. We anticipate such a mitochondria-targeting fluorescent dye can be used to facilitate the study of mitochondrial dynamics and function in the context of whole-brain physiology and disease progression. Further research into the safety and efficacy of this dye may be necessary.",

    "abstract": "The surge in demand for experimental monkeys has led to a rapid increase in their associated costs. Consequently, there is a growing need for the development of a cost-effective model for Parkinson\\'s disease (PD) that exhibits all core clinical and pathological phenotypes of PD. Evolutionarily, tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) are much closer to primates in comparison to rodents and share more similar PD-related brain structures and movement ability with monkeys. As such, tree shrews represent an ideal small animal species for modeling PD. To develop a tree shrew PD model, we used the 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) metabolite, derived from the well-established PD modeling drug 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), to induce lesions in the dopaminergic neurons of the unilateral substantia nigra. After determining the optimal modeling dosage, the tree shrews consistently exhibited and maintained all classic clinical manifestations of PD for a 5-month period. The symptoms closely resembled the ones observed in PD monkeys and included bradykinesia, rest tremor, postural instability, and apomorphine-induced rotations, a classic phenotype of unilateral PD models. Immunostaining showed a significant loss of dopaminergic neurons (approximately 95%) in the substantia nigra on the lesioned side of the brain, a crucial pathological marker of PD. Further cytomorphological analysis revealed that the size of nigral dopaminergic neurons in tree shrews exceeded that of rodents and more closely approximated that of macaques. Based on the principle that structure determines function, the morphological similarity between tree shrews and monkeys may be an important structural basis for the manifestation of the highly similar phenotypes between monkey and tree shrew PD models. Collectively, this study successfully developed a PD model in a small animal species that faithfully recapitulated the classical clinical symptoms and key pathological indicators of PD monkeys. In addition to the well-recognized monkey models, the tree shrew model provides a novel avenue for the evaluation of PD treatments and underlying mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Prosocial behavior is the cornerstone of a harmonious society. However, the functional organization of the brain underlying prosocial decision-making needs to be further explored. Here, we used graph theory analysis to investigate the brain functional connectivity derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans during rest in 55 female Chinese university students. The behavioral responses were collected in another fMRI scan during which participants completed an economic exchange game task by making multiple choices between a prosocial and a selfish option against either human counterparts (i.e., social environment) or robot counterparts (i.e., non-social environment). We found that making more prosocial decisions is accompanied by a longer path length in the right anterior superior temporal gyrus (aSTG), higher degree centrality in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and higher betweenness centrality in the left aSTG. Our results suggest that human prosocial decisions are associated with greater inter-regional collaborations that are dominated by a few core nodes within the brain network of Theory of Mind (ToM). Moreover, an individual\\'s preference for making prosocial decisions could be uncovered by graph theory analysis of the functional brain network even without explicit task requirements.",

The biology of plastids and mitochondria can differ significantly across major lineages and organelle adaptation likely accompanied the conquering of new ecological niches including land. Based on organelle proteome data, and the genomes of 168 phototrophic (Archaeplastida) versus a broad range of 518 non-phototrophic eukaryotes, we screened for changes in plastid and mitochondrial biology across one billion years of evolution. Taking into account 331,571 protein families (or orthogroups), we identify 31,625 protein families that are unique to primary plastid-bearing eukaryotes. 1961 and 846 protein families are predicted to operate in plastids and mitochondria, respectively. Tracing the evolutionary history of these protein families through evolutionary time uncovers the significant remodelling the organelles experienced from algae to land plants. The analyses of gained orthogroups identifies molecular adaptations of organelle biology that connect to the diversification of major lineages and facilitated major transitions from chlorophytes en route to the global greening and origin of angiosperms.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian linear regression (BLR) models consider the underlying genetic architecture of complex phenotypes by specifying different prior distributions for SNP effects allowing heterogenous distribution of the true genetic signals. Our goal is to evaluate BLR models with BayesC and BayesR prior distributions for fine mapping on simulated and real binary and quantitative phenotypes, and compare them to the state-of-the-art external models: FINEMAP, SuSIE-RSS, SuSIE-Inf and FINEMAP-Inf. Evaluation of models was based on the F1 classification score for simulations, and predictive accuracy for the UK Biobank (UKB) phenotypes. We used over 533K genotyped SNPs (simulations) and 6.6 million imputed SNPs (UKB phenotypes), from over 335K White British Unrelated samples in the UK biobank. We simulated phenotypes from low (GA1) to moderate (GA2) polygenicity, heritability(h^2) of 30% and 10%, causal SNPs ({pi}) of 0.1% and 1% sampled genome-wide, and prevalence (PV) of 5% and 15%. Summary statistics and in-sample linkage disequilibrium were used to fit models in regions defined by lead SNPs. BayesR improved the F1 score, averaged across all simulations, by by 27.26%, 26.96%, 18.40%, 15.42%, and 13.32% relative to FINEMAP-Inf, BayesC, FINEMAP, SUSIE-RSS and SUSIE-Inf. Prediction R2, averaged across all the UKB quantitative phenotypes, with BayesR decreased by 5.32% and 3.71% compared to SuSIE-Inf and FINEMAP-Inf, whereas increased by 7.93% and 8.3% compared to SuSIE-RSS and BayesC. Prediction AUC, averaged across all the UKB binary phenotypes, with BayesR increased by 0.40%, 0.16%, 0.08%., and 0.05% relative to SuSIE-RSS, BayesC, FINEMAP-Inf, and SuSIE-Inf. These findings suggest that the performance of the BLR models was comparable to the state-of-the-art external models. The performance of BayesR prior was closely aligned with SuSIE-Inf and FINEMAP-Inf models. Results from both simulations and application of the models in the UKB phenotypes suggest that the BLR models are efficient fine mapping tools.",
