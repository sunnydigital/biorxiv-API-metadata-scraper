    "abstract": "Avoidance behavior is a major causal and maintaining factor in anxiety. As anxious individuals avoid social situations, their fear cannot be extinguished and context-appropriate behavior cannot be learned. It has been shown that successful emotion control over social approach-avoidance actions relies on theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling between the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) and the sensorimotor cortices (SMC). Emotional action control can also be facilitated by targeting theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling between lPFC and SMC using dual-site transcranial alternating current stimulation (dual-tACS), in non-anxious individuals (Bramson et al., 2020). However, it remains unclear whether this intervention is effective where it is needed: For instance, socially anxious individuals fail to recruit lPFC and rely on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) for emotional action control (Bramson et al., 2023). Here, we show that dual-tACS improves emotional action control in social anxiety, acting on dlPFC-SMC coupling instead of lPFC-SMC coupling. Forty-nine highly socially anxious individuals performed a social approach-avoidance task while receiving dual-site in-phase, anti-phase, and sham tACS. Concurrent BOLD fMRI measurements revealed that the neural response to tACS in dlPFC mediates improvement in emotional action control induced by the in-phase stimulation. Notably, the extent of dlPFC engagement scaled to individuals' trait anxiety levels. These findings illustrate how human neurophysiological connectivity can be leveraged to improve emotion control over social avoidance, opening the way for mechanistically-grounded clinical interventions of persistent avoidance in anxiety disorders.",

    "abstract": "apparent paradox, neurons only weakly metabolize glucose through glycolysis, a circumstance that can be accounted for by the constant degradation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (Pfkfb3), a key glycolysis-promoting enzyme. To evaluate the in vivo physiological significance of this hypo-glycolytic metabolism, here we genetically engineered mice with their neurons transformed into active glycolytic cells through Pfkfb3 expression. In vivo molecular, biochemical, and metabolic flux analyses of these neurons revealed an accumulation of anomalous mitochondria, complex I disassembly, bioenergetic deficiency and mitochondrial redox stress. Notably, glycolysis-mediated NAD reduction impaired sirtuin-dependent autophagy. Furthermore, these mice displayed cognitive decline and a metabolic syndrome that was mimicked by confining Pfkfb3 expression to hypothalamic neurons. Neuron-specific genetic ablation of mitochondrial redox stress corrected these alterations. Thus, the weak glycolytic nature of neurons is required to sustain higher-order organismal functions.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine significantly modulates working memory (WM), a fundamental cognitive function that maintains information during a brief delay period. The temporal precision of dopaminergic modulation in WM and related neural mechanisms remain elusive. Here we unveiled the pivotal role of dopamine timing in WM performance with head-fixed mice engaged in learning an olfactory WM task. Through electrophysiology and optogenetics, we found that dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) could encode WM information during the delay period, and manipulating dopaminergic neuronal activity bidirectionally modulated WM performance in an inverted U-shaped manner. Optogenetic manipulation of VTA activity also induced bidirectional changes in WM-related neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Imaging with a dopamine-sensitive GPCR-activation-based sensor (GRABDA revealed transient dopamine peaks in the mPFC specifically during the early-delay period. Optogenetic stimulation of VTA-to-mPFC dopaminergic projections during the early- and late-delay period enhanced and impaired WM performance, respectively. Manipulations outside these periods or involving the nucleus accumbens had no effect. Single-unit recordings demonstrated that optogenetic excitation of VTA-to-mPFC projections could modulate mPFC neuronal activity in a manner consistent with behavioral modulation. Thus, the timing of dopamine release is critical in modulation of neuronal activity and behavior.",

    "abstract": "Sleep associated memory consolidation and reactivation play an important role in language acquisition and learning of new words. However, it is unclear to what extent properties of word learning difficulty impact sleep associated memory reactivation. To address this gap, we investigated in twenty-two young healthy adults the effectiveness of auditory targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during non-rapid eye movement sleep of artificial words with easy and difficult to learn phonotactical properties. Here, we found that TMR of the easy words improved their overnight memory performance, whereas TMR of the difficult words had no effect. By comparing EEG activities after TMR presentations, we found an increase in slow wave density independent of word difficulty, whereas the spindle-band power nested during the slow wave up-states - as an assumed underlying activity of memory reactivation - was significantly higher in the easy/effective compared to the difficult/ineffective condition. Our findings indicate that word learning difficulty by phonotactics impacts the effectiveness of TMR and further emphasize the critical role of prior encoding depth in sleep associated memory reactivation.",

    "abstract": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) helps govern motivation to pursue rewards. Two distinct sets of NAc projection neurons - expressing dopamine D1 versus D2 receptors - are thought to promote and suppress motivated behaviors respectively. However, support for this conceptual framework is limited: in particular the spiking patterns of these distinct cell types during motivated behavior have been largely unknown. We monitored identified D1+ and D2+ neurons in the NAc Core, as unrestrained rats performed an operant task in which motivation to initiate work tracks recent reward rate. D1+ neurons preferentially increased firing as rats initiated trials, and fired more when reward expectation was higher. By contrast, D2+ cells preferentially increased firing later in the trial especially in response to reward delivery - a finding not anticipated from current theoretical models. Our results provide new evidence for the specific contribution of NAc D1+ cells to self-initiated approach behavior, and will spur updated models of how we learn from rewards.",
