    "abstract": "Interaction networks are a widely used tool to understand the dynamics of plant-pollinator ecological communities. However, while most mutualistic networks have been defined at the species level, ecological processes such as pollination take place at different scales, including the individual or patch levels. Yet, current approaches studying fine-grain sub-specific plant-pollinator networks only account for interactions among nodes belonging to a single plant species due to the conceptual and mathematical limitations of modeling simultaneously several plant species each composed of several nodes. Here, we introduce a multilayer diffusion network framework that allows modeling simple diffusion processes between nodes pertaining to the same or different layers (i.e. species). It is designed to depict from the network structure the potential conspecific and heterospecific pollen flows among plant individuals or patches. This potential pollen flow is modeled as a transport-like system, in which pollen grain movements are represented as random-walkers that diffuse on an ensemble of bipartite layers of conspecific plants and their shared pollinators. We exemplify this physical conceptualization using a dataset of nine fine-grain sub-specific plant-pollinator networks from a Mediterranean grassland of annual plants, where plant nodes represent groups of conspecifics within patches of 1 m2. The diffusion networks show pollinators effectively connecting sets of patches of the same and different plant species, forming a modular structure. Interestingly, different properties of the network structure, such as the conspecific pollen arrival probability and the number of conspecific subgraphs in which plants are embedded, are critical for the seed production of different plant species. We provide a simple but robust set of metrics to calculate potential pollen flow and scale down network ecology to functioning properties at the individual or patch level, where most ecological processes take place, hence moving forward the description and interpretation of species-rich communities across scales.",

    "abstract": "Empirical research is increasingly documenting eco-evolutionary dynamics that shape ecological processes. I examine the population dynamic implications of this, analysing whether natural selection improves our ability to predict population dynamic trajectories. Fitting single-species population dynamic models to 3,368 and 480 timeseries for 900 species of birds and 208 mammals, I find that selection-based population dynamic models are 320 (se:1.3) times more probable on average than models with no selection. Selection is essential in 76% to 90% of AIC-selected models, explaining 80% of the population dynamics variance, with median selection regulation being 1.5 (se:1.1) times stronger than density regulation. The estimated dynamics is cyclic with median damping ratios for birds and mammals of 0.12 (se:0.0068) and 0.083 (se:0.022), and population periods of 8 (se:0.56) and 6.1 (se:1.1) generations, given stable cycles with damping ratios around zero. These results highlight the necessity of integrating natural selection into population dynamic theory, and they are discussed in relation to the literature resolving several enigmas of population dynamic cycle.",

    "abstract": "Many bacteria encode multiple toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems targeting separate, but closely related, cellular functions. The toxin of the E. coli hipBA system, HipA, is a kinase that inhibits translation via phosphorylation of glutamyl-tRNA synthetase. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) O127:H6 encodes the hipBA-like, tripartite TA system; hipBST, in which the HipT toxin specifically targets the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, TrpS. Notably, in the tripartite system, the function as antitoxin has been taken over by the third protein, HipS, but the molecular details of how activity of HipT is inhibited remain poorly understood. Here, we show that HipBST is structurally different from E. coli HipBA and that the unique HipS protein, which is homologous to the N-terminal subdomain of HipA, inhibits the kinase through insertion of a conserved Trp residue into the active site. We also show how auto-phosphorylation at two conserved sites in the kinase toxin serve different roles and affect the ability of HipS to neutralize HipT. Finally, solution structural studies show how phosphorylation affects overall TA complex flexibility.",

    "abstract": "The flow of information between cortical regions depends on the excitability at each site, which is reflected in fluctuating field potentials. It remains uncertain how global changes in field potentials affect the latency and strength of cortico-cortical couplings. Therefore, we measured changes in oscillations and inter-regional couplings by recording intracranially from the human cerebral cortex. As participants listened to an auditory narrative, global increases in low-frequency (4-14 Hz) power were associated with stronger and more delayed inter-regional couplings. Conversely, increases in broadband high-frequency power were associated with weaker coupling and zero lag. In network oscillator models, these changes in cortico-cortical latency can be generated by varying the effective influence of inter-regional projections relative to intra-regional dynamics. Altogether, low-frequency oscillations appear to modulate information flow across the human cerebral cortex, as they covary with the timing of peak excitability between regions, and this process may be regulated by nonspecific ascending projections.",

    "abstract": "CYP2D6 is a widely expressed human xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme, best known for its role in the hepatic phase I cytochrome P450 enzyme system, where it metabolizes ~20% of medications. It is also expressed in other organs including the brain, where its potential role in physiology and mental health traits and disorders is under further investigation. Owing to the presence of homologous pseudogenes in the CYP2D locus and transposable repeat elements in the intergenic regions, the gene encoding the CYP2D6 enzyme, CYP2D6, is one of the most hypervariable known human genes - with more than 165 core haplotypes. Haplotypes include structural variants, with a subtype of these known as hybrid haplotypes or fusion genes comprising part of CYP2D6 and part of its adjacent pseudogene, CYP2D7. The fusion genes are particularly challenging to identify. High fidelity (HiFi) single molecule real-time (SMRT) long-read sequencing can cover whole CYP2D6 haplotypes in a single continuous sequence, and is therefore ideal for structural variant detection. In addition, it is highly accurate and suitable for novel haplotype identification, which is necessary as new CYP2D6 haplotypes are continuously being discovered, and many more likely remain to be identified in relatively understudied populations such as Indigenous Peoples. The aim of the present work was to develop an efficient and accurate HiFi SMRT amplicon-based method capable of detecting the full range of CYP2D6 haplotypes including fusion genes. We report proof-of-concept for 24 amplicons including three positive controls, aligned to fusion gene haplotypes, with prior cross-validation data. Amplicons with CYP2D7-D6 fusion genes, including positive controls, aligned to the *13 subhaplotypes predicted (*13F, *13A2) with 100% accuracy, with the exception of one that aligned at 99.9%. Alignment of the *68 was 100% and above 99.9% to the CYP2D6*68 partial sequences EU5300606 and JF307779, respectively. The best alignments for the remaining CYP2D6-2D7 fusion genes were [&ge;]99.7% (to 3 significant figures). Lower percentage alignment for CYP2D6-2D7 fusion genes may reflect imperfect PCR optimization and/or the possibility that we may have haplotypes not yet in public databases. Further work on these is in progress. Moreover, we have adapted this method for non-hybrid haplotypes. This technique could therefore suffice for the characterization of the full range of CYP2D6 haplotypes. The method that we have developed could be extended to other complex loci and to other species in a multiplexed high throughput assay.",

    "abstract": "Research in social mammals has revealed the complexity of strategies females use in response to female-female reproductive competition and sexual conflict. One point at which competition and conflict manifests acutely is during sexual receptivity, indicated by swellings in some primates. Whether females can adjust their sexual receptivity from cycle to cycle to decrease reproductive competition and sexual conflict in response to changes in the social environment has not been tested. As a first step, this study explores whether sexual receptivity duration is predicted by the social environment in wild female chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). Given that female baboons face intense reproductive competition and sexual coercion, we predicted that: females could shorten the duration of their sexual receptive period to reduce female-female aggression and male coercion or increase it to access multiple or their preferred male(s). We quantified 157 ovulatory cycles from 46 wild females living in central Namibia recorded over 15 years. We found no support for our hypothesis; however, we found a negative correlation between maximal-swelling duration and group size, a proxy of within-group competition. This study provides further evidence that swelling is costly for females as well as a testable framework for future investigations of cycle length manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Temporal binding has been understood as an illusion in timing judgement. When an action triggers an outcome (e.g. a sound) after a brief delay, the action is reported to occur later than if the outcome does not occur, and the outcome is reported to occur earlier than a similar outcome not caused by an action. We show here that an attention mechanism underlies the seeming illusion of timing judgement. In one method, participants watch a rotating clock hand and report event times by noting the clock hand position when the event occurs. We find that visual attention is critically involved in shaping event time reports made in this way. This occurs because action and outcome events result in shifts of attention around the clock rim, thereby biasing the perceived location of the clock hand. Using a probe detection task to measure attention, we show a difference in attention distribution between a single-event condition (sound only or action only) and a two-event agency condition (action plus sound). Participants accordingly report the timing of the same event (the sound or the action) differently in the two conditions: spatial attentional shifts masquerading as temporal binding. Furthermore, computational modelling based on the attention measure can reproduce temporal binding. Studies that use time judgement as an implicit marker of voluntary agency should first discount the artefactual changes in event timing reports that actually reflect differences in spatial attention. The study also has important implications for related results in mental chronometry obtained with the clock-like method since Wundt, as attention may well be a critical confounding factor in the interpretation of these studies.",

    "abstract": "Identifying regions of the genome that act as barriers to gene flow between recently diverged taxa has remained challenging given the many evolutionary forces that generate variation in genetic diversity and divergence along the genome, and the stochastic nature of this variation. Progress has been impeded by a conceptual and methodological divide between analyses that infer the demographic history of speciation and genome scans aimed at identifying locally maladaptive alleles i.e. genomic barriers to gene flow. Here we implement genomewide IM blockwise likelihood estimation (gIMble), a composite likelihood approach for the quantification of barriers, that bridges this divide. This analytic framework captures background selection and selection against barriers in a model of isolation with migration (IM) as heterogeneity in effective population size (Ne) and effective migration rate (me), respectively. Variation in both effective demographic parameters is estimated in sliding windows via pre-computed likelihood grids. gIMble includes modules for pre-processing/filtering of genomic data and performing parametric bootstraps using coalescent simulations. To demonstrate the new approach, we analyse data from a well-studied pair of sister species of tropical butterflies with a known history of post-divergence gene flow: Heliconius melpomene and H. cydno. Our analyses uncover both large-effect barrier loci (including well-known wing-pattern genes) and a genome-wide signal of a polygenic barrier architecture.",

    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is an osteolytic plasma cell malignancy that, despite being responsive to therapies such as proteasome inhibitors, frequently relapses. Understanding the mechanism and the niches where resistant disease evolves remains of major clinical importance. Cancer cell intrinsic mechanisms and bone ecosystem factors are known contributors to the evolution of resistant MM but the exact contribution of each is difficult to define with current in vitro and in vivo models. However, mathematical modeling can help address this gap in knowledge. Here, we describe a novel biology-driven hybrid agent-based model that incorporates key cellular species of the bone ecosystem that control normal bone remodeling and, in MM, yields a protective environment under therapy. Critically, the spatiotemporal nature of the model captures two key features: normal bone homeostasis and how MM interacts with the bone ecosystem to induce bone destruction. We next used the model to examine how the bone ecosystem contributes to the evolutionary dynamics of resistant MM under control and proteasome inhibitor treatment. Our data demonstrates that resistant disease cannot develop without MM intrinsic mechanisms. However, protection from the bone microenvironment dramatically increases the likelihood of developing intrinsic resistance and subsequent relapse. The spatial nature of the model also reveals how the bone ecosystem provides a protective niche for drug sensitive MM cells under treatment, consequently leading to the emergence of a heterogenous and drug resistant disease. In conclusion, our data demonstrates a significant role for the bone ecosystem in MM survival and resistance, and suggests that early intervention with bone ecosystem targeting therapies may prevent the emergence of heterogeneous drug resistant MM.",

We devised a metric of cellular metabolic rate (cMR), rMR optimally fit to the number of microRNA families (miRNA.Fam), that is robust to variation in mass and sensitive to body temperature, consistent with the heat dissipation limit theory of Speakman and Krol (2010). Relatively abrupt increases in miRNA.Fam and cMR in later-branching, permanently homeothermic Boreoeutheria led us to postulate the emergence of new optimum in the adaptive landscape. With miRNA.Fam as predictor, simulation of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process of stabilizing selection, together with an adaptive shift between Atlantogenata and Boreoeutheria, accounted for 95% of the variation in cMR. Branchwise rates of evolution of cMR, miRNA.Fam and body temperature concurrently increased 6- to 7-fold, independent of the evolution of mass. Cellular MR variation across placental mammals was also predicted by the energy spared by model conserved microRNA-target interactions, revealing an unexpected degree of integration of the microRNA-target apparatus into the energy economy of the mammalian cell.",

We propose that this architecture enables better learning and generalization than architectures with less specialized modules. To test this hypothesis, we trained reinforcement learning agents with various neural architectures on a naturalistic navigation task. We found that the architecture that largely segregates computations of state representation, value, and action into specialized modules enables more efficient learning and better generalization. Behaviors of agents with this architecture also resemble macaque behaviors more closely. Investigating the latent state computations in these agents, we discovered that the learned state representation combines prediction and observation, weighted by their relative uncertainty, akin to a Kalman filter. These results shed light on the possible rationale for the brain's modular specializations and suggest that artificial systems can use this insight from neuroscience to improve learning and generalization in natural tasks.",

We have shown that mice with {beta}-cell dysfunction and normal insulin sensitivity have decreased skeletal muscle mass. This project asks how insulin deficiency impacts on the structure and function of the remaining skeletal muscle in these animals. Methods: Skeletal muscle function was determined by measuring exercise capacity and specific muscle strength prior to and after insulin supplementation for 28 days in 12-week-old mice with conditional {beta}-cell deletion of the ATP binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 ({beta}-DKO mice). Abca1 and Abcg1 floxed (fl/fl) mice were used as controls. RNAseq was used to quantify changes in transcripts in soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles. Skeletal muscle and mitochondrial morphology were assessed by transmission electron microscopy. Myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity and maximum isometric single muscle fibre force were assessed using MyoRobot biomechatronics technology. Results: RNA transcripts were significantly altered in {beta}-DKO mice compared to fl/fl controls (32 in extensor digitorum longus and 412 in soleus). Exercise capacity and muscle strength were significantly decreased in {beta}-DKO mice compared to fl/fl controls (p = 0.012), and a loss of structural integrity was also observed in skeletal muscle from the {beta}-DKO mice. Supplementation of {beta}-DKO mice with insulin restored muscle integrity, strength and expression of 13 and 16 of the dysregulated transcripts in and extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles, respectively. Conclusions: Insulin insufficiency due to {beta}-cell dysfunction perturbs the structure and function of skeletal muscle. These adverse effects are rectified by insulin supplementation.",

Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) have many applications in agriculture but may not be compatible with biological control; however, low concentrations of SeNPs may benefit natural enemies via hormesis. This study investigates the concentration-dependent effects of SeNPs (0-1000 mg L-1) on Anisopteromalus calandrae (Howard) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), a generalist parasitoid of stored product pests. RESULTS: The LC50 of SeNPs was 1540 mg L-1 for female parasitoids and 1164 mg L-1 for males. SeNPs had a significant hormetic effect; average lifespan increased by 10% at a concentration of 4.03 mg L-1 for females and by 35% at 13.83 mg L-1 for males. In a bioassay including hosts (the azuki bean beetle, Callosobruchus chinensis (L.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae)), a low concentration of SeNPs (25 mg L-1) enhanced the performance of female parasitoids; lifespan increased by 23% and the number of offspring increased by 88%. However, the number of emerging hosts did not significantly decrease; in the absence of parasitism, SeNPs actually improved host emergence by 17%. CONCLUSION: Because higher concentrations of SeNPs reduced parasitoid lifespan, whereas low concentrations enhanced not only parasitoid performance but also host emergence, practitioners should exercise caution when considering SeNPs for use in integrated pest management.",

    "abstract": "Identifying structure-function correspondences is a major goal among biologists, cognitive neuroscientists, and brain mappers. Recent studies have identified relationships between performance on cognitive tasks and the presence or absence of small, shallow indentations, or sulci, of the human brain. Building on the previous finding that the presence of one such sulcus in the left anterior lateral prefrontal cortex (aLPFC) was related to reasoning task performance in children and adolescents, we tested whether this relationship extended to a different sample, age group, and reasoning task. As predicted, the presence of this aLPFC sulcus, the ventral para-intermediate frontal sulcus, was also associated with higher reasoning scores in young adults (ages 22-36). These findings have not only direct developmental, but also evolutionary relevance, as recent work shows that the pimfs-v is exceedingly rare in chimpanzees. Thus, the pimfs-v is a novel developmental, cognitive, and evolutionarily relevant feature that should be considered in future studies examining how the complex relationships among multiscale anatomical and functional features of the brain give rise to abstract thought.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus executes crucial functions from declarative memory to adaptive behaviors associated with cognition and emotion. However, the mechanisms of how morphogenesis and functions along the hippocampal dorsoventral axis are differentiated and integrated are still largely unclear. Here, we show that Nr2f1 and Nr2f2 genes are distinctively expressed in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, respectively. The loss of Nr2f2 results in ectopic CA1/CA3 domains in the ventral hippocampus. The deficiency of Nr2f1 leads to the failed specification of dorsal CA1, among which there are place cells. The deletion of both Nr2f genes causes almost agenesis of the hippocampus with abnormalities of trisynaptic circuit and adult neurogenesis. Moreover, Nr2f1/2 may cooperate to guarantee appropriate morphogenesis and function of the hippocampus by regulating the Lhx5-Lhx2 axis. Our findings revealed a novel mechanism that Nr2f1 and Nr2f2 converge to govern the differentiation and integration of distinct characteristics of the hippocampus in mice.",

We categorized significant genetic variants as acting either through the neuroticism general factor, through other factors measured by the questionnaire, or through paths independent of any factor. Regardless of this categorization, however, significant variants tended to show concordant associations with all items. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the variants associated with the neuroticism general factor disproportionately lie near or within genes expressed in the brain. Enriched gene sets pointed to an underlying biological basis associated with brain development, synaptic function, and behaviors in mice indicative of fear and anxiety. Psychologists have long asked whether psychometric common factors are merely a convenient summary of correlated variables or reflect coherent causal entities with a partial biological basis, and our results provide some support for the latter interpretation. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which causes resembling common factors operate alongside other mechanisms to generate the correlational structure of personality.",

While cristae-shaping proteins have been defined, analogous mechanisms for lipids have yet to be elucidated. Here we combine experimental lipidome dissection with multi-scale modeling to investigate how lipid interactions dictate IMM morphology and ATP generation. When modulating phospholipid (PL) saturation in engineered yeast strains, we observed a surprisingly abrupt breakpoint in IMM topology driven by a continuous loss of ATP synthase organization at cristae ridges. We found that cardiolipin (CL) specifically buffers the IMM against curvature loss, an effect that is independent of ATP synthase dimerization. To explain this interaction, we developed a continuum model for cristae tubule formation that integrates both lipid and protein-mediated curvatures. The model highlighted a snapthrough instability, which drives IMM collapse upon small changes in membrane properties. We also showed that CL is essential in low oxygen conditions that promote PL saturation. These results demonstrate that the mechanical function of CL is dependent on the surrounding lipid and protein components of the IMM.",

With deep representations from a pre-trained protein language model to predict similarity, PLMSearch can capture the remote homology information hidden behind the sequences. Extensive experimental results show that PLMSearch can search millions of query-target protein pairs in seconds like MMseqs2 while increasing the sensitivity by more than threefold, and is comparable to state-of-the-art structure search methods. In particular, unlike traditional sequence search methods, PLMSearch can recall most remote homology pairs with low sequence similarity but sharing similar structures.

    "abstract": "Here, we investigated mechanisms by which aging-related diminished levels of Numb in skeletal muscle fibers contribute to loss of muscle strength and power, two critical features of sarcopenia. Numb is an adaptor protein best known for its critical roles in development including asymmetric cell division, cell-type specification and termination of intracellular signaling. Numb expression is reduced in old humans and mice. We previously showed that, in skeletal muscle fibers, Numb is localized to sarcomeres where it is concentrated near triads. Conditional inactivation of Numb in myofibers causes weakness, disorganization of sarcomeres and smaller mitochondria with impaired function. Proteomics analysis of protein complexes isolated from C2C12 myotubes by immunoprecipitation using antibodies against Numb indicated that Septin 7 is a potential Numb binding partner. Septin 7 is a member of the family of GTP-binding proteins that organize into filaments, sheets and rings, and is considered part of the cytoskeleton. Immunofluorescence evaluation revealed a partial overlap of staining for Numb and Septin 7 in myofibers. Conditional, inducible knockouts of Numb led to disorganization of Septin 7 staining in myofibers. These findings support the conclusion that Septin 7 is a Numb binding partner. Because prior reports showed that conditional inactivation of Septin 7 in skeletal muscle led to weakness and disorganization of sarcomeres, and altered mitochondrial size, we also conclude that interactions between Numb and Septin 7 are critical for proper structural organization of the sarcomere, for optimal muscle contractile function, and for control of the size and function of mitochondria.",

Current technologies allow high-throughput measurement of such copy number aberrations, generating results consisting of frequently large sets of SCNA segments. However, the automated annotation and integration of such data are particularly challenging because the measured signals reflect biased, relative copy number ratios. In this study, we introduce labelSeg, an algorithm designed for rapid and accurate annotation of CNA segments, with the aim of enhancing the interpretation of tumor SCNA profiles. Leveraging density-based clustering and exploiting the length-amplitude relationships of SCNA, our algorithm proficiently identifies distinct relative copy number states from individual segment profiles. Its compatibility with most CNA measurement platforms makes it suitable for large-scale integrative data analysis. We confirmed its performance on both simulated and sample-derived data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reference dataset, and we demonstrated its utility in integrating heterogeneous segment profiles from different data sources and measurement platforms. Our comparative and integrative analysis revealed common SCNA patterns in cancer and protein-coding genes with a strong correlation between SCNA and mRNA expression, promoting the investigation into the role of SCNA in cancer development.",

    "abstract": "The marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is a main contributor to global photosynthesis, whilst being limited by iron availability. Cyanobacterial genomes typically encode two different types of FutA iron binding proteins: periplasmic FutA2 ABC transporter subunits bind Fe(III), while cytosolic FutA1 binds Fe(II). Owing to their small size and their economized genome Prochlorococcus ecotypes typically possess a single futA gene. How the encoded FutA protein might bind different Fe oxidation states was previously unknown. Here we use structural biology techniques at room temperature to probe the dynamic behavior of FutA. Neutron diffraction confirmed four negatively charged tyrosinates, that together with a neutral water molecule coordinate iron in trigonal bipyramidal geometry. Positioning of the positively charged Arg103 side chain in the second coordination shell yields an overall charge-neutral Fe(III) binding state in structures determined by neutron diffraction and serial femtosecond crystallography. Conventional rotation X-ray crystallography using a home source revealed X-ray induced photoreduction of the iron center with observation of the Fe(II) binding state; here, an additional positioning of the Arg203 side chain in the second coordination shell maintained an overall charge neutral Fe(II) binding site. Dose series using serial synchrotron crystallography and an XFEL X-ray pump-probe approach capture the transition between Fe(III) and Fe(II) states, revealing how Arg203 operates as a switch to accommodate the different iron oxidation states. This switching ability of the Prochlorococcus FutA protein may reflect ecological adaptation by genome streamlining and loss of specialized FutA proteins.",

Genomic studies have examined species-specific gene birth, gene loss, and changes in promoters and transcription factor binding sites, but species-specific epigenetic regulation remains barely explored. This study identified human-specific long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) from GENCODE-annotated human lncRNAs, predicted their DNA binding sites (DBSs) genome-wide, analyzed these DBSs and their counterparts in modern humans (CEU, CHB, and YRI), archaic humans (Altai Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Vindija Neanderthals), and chimpanzees, and analyzed the impact of DBSs on gene expression in modern and archaic humans. The results suggest that human-specific lncRNAs and their DBSs have substantially rewired gene expression human-specifically and that the rewiring has evolved continuously from archaic to modern humans. Rewired gene expression promotes brain development, makes humans adapt to new environments and lifestyles, and causes differences in modern humans. These results uncover a critical dimension of human evolution and underscore the diverse functions of species-specific lncRNAs.",

The SApNP-based vaccine strategy was first validated for human M2e (hM2e) and then applied to tandem repeats of M2e from human, avian and swine hosts (M2ex3). Vaccination with M2ex3 displayed on SApNPs demonstrated higher survival rates and lower weight loss compared to the soluble M2ex3 antigen against lethal challenges of H1N1 and H3N2 in mice.

Recent works proposed novel scenarios and the northern Peru/Ecuador population has been described as a new species called P. debouckii, rekindling the debate about the origin of P. vulgaris. Here we shed light on the origin of P. vulgaris by analysing the chloroplast and nuclear genomes of a large varietal collection representing the entire geographical distribution of wild forms. We assembled 37 chloroplast genomes de novo and used them to construct a time frame for the divergence of the genotypes under investigation, revealing that the separation of the Mesoamerican and northern Peru/Ecuador genepools occurred [~]0.15 Mya. Our results clearly support a Mesoamerican origin of the common bean and reject the recent P. deboukii hypothesis. These results also imply two independent migratory events from Mesoamerica to the North and South Andes, probably facilitated by birds.

    "abstract": "Gene prediction remains an active area of bioinformatics research. Challenges are presented by large eukaryotic genomes and heterogeneous data situations. To meet the challenges, several streams of evidence must be integrated, from protein homology and transcriptome data, as well as information derived from the genome itself. The amount and significance of the available evidence from transcriptomes and proteomes vary from genome to genome, between genes and even along a single gene. User-friendly and accurate annotation pipelines that can cope with such data heterogeneity are needed. The previously developed annotation pipelines BRAKER1 and BRAKER2 use RNA-Seq or protein data, respectively, but not both. The recently released GeneMark-ETP integrates all three types of data and achieves much higher levels of accuracy. We here present the BRAKER3 pipeline that builds on GeneMark-ETP and AUGUSTUS and further improves accuracy using the TSEBRA combiner. BRAKER3 annotates protein-coding genes in eukaryotic genomes using both short-read RNA-Seq and a large protein database along with statistical models learned iteratively and specifically for the target genome. We benchmarked the new pipeline on 11 species under controlled conditions on the assumed relatedness of the target species to available proteomes. BRAKER3 outperformed BRAKER1 and BRAKER2, increasing the average transcript-level F1-score by ~20 percentage points, most pronounced for species with large and complex genomes. BRAKER3 also outperforms MAKER2 and Funannotate. For the first time, we provide a Singularity container for the BRAKER software to minimize installation obstacles. Overall, BRAKER3 is an accurate, easy-to-use tool for the annotation of eukaryotic genomes.",

    "abstract": "The basal breast cancer subtype is enriched for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and displays consistent large chromosomal deletions. Here, we characterize the evolution and maintenance of chromosome 4p (chr4p) loss in basal breast cancer. TCGA data analysis showed recurrent deletion of chr4p in basal breast cancer. Phylogenetic analysis of a unique panel of 23 primary tumor/patient-derived xenograft basal breast cancer revealed early evolution of chr4p deletion. Chr4p loss is associated with enhanced proliferation and immune evasion. We characterized an unknown gene, C4orf19, within chr4p, which suppressed proliferation when overexpressed and is a member of a novel PDCD10-GCKIII kinase module, and we refer to it as PGCA1. Genome-wide pooled overexpression screens using a barcoded library of human open reading frames, identified chromosomal regions, including chr4p, that suppress proliferation when overexpressed in a context-dependent manner. Together this sheds light on the early emergence of complex aneuploid karyotypes involving chr4p and adaptive landscapes shaping breast cancer genomes.",

Machine Learning is increasingly applied in this field to predict properties of proteins, thereby guiding the experimental optimization process. A natural question is: How much progress are we making with such predictions, and how important is the choice of regressor and representation? In this paper, we demonstrate that different assessment criteria for regressor performance can lead to dramatically different conclusions, depending on the choice of metric, and how one defines generalization. We highlight the fundamental issues of sample bias in typical regression scenarios and how this can lead to misleading conclusions about regressor performance.

    "abstract": "How should a parent optimally distribute limited resources among its offspring? This question is as relevant to a mother bird deciding how to allocate food among her chicks as it is to a bacterium dividing high-quality organelles between its daughters. Optimal offspring size theory has long explored the tradeoff between the number and size of offspring in higher organisms. Meanwhile, the emerging field of bacterial aging examines when cells evolve unequal sharing of old cellular components. Our study unifies these two disciplines through a model of resource allocation. This model highlights that the convexity of how resources affect offspring survivorship determines whether even or uneven resource distribution evolves. Based on this, we derive the optimal resource distribution strategies, show that they evolve, and characterize when these strategies are robust to fluctuating environments. These results not only agree with and strengthen existing models, but also provide an organizing framework that enables new predictions. These include the conditions which select for strategies that contain a \"runt of the litter.\"",

The contextual modulation of behavior likely relies on regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that multiplex information about emotional/autonomic states and behaviours. The objective of the present study was to understand how the representations of behaviors by ACC neurons become modified when performed in different emotional states. A pipeline of machine learning techniques was developed to categorize and classify complex, spontaneous behaviors from video. This pipeline, termed HUB-DT, discovered a range of statistically separable behaviors during a task in which motivationally significant outcomes were delivered in blocks of trials that created 3 unique \"emotional contexts\". HUB-DT was capable of detecting behaviors specific to each emotional context and was able to identify and segregate the portions of a neural signal related to a behaviour and to emotional context. Overall, ~10x as many neurons responded to behaviors in a contextually dependent versus a fixed manner, highlighting the extreme impact of emotional state on representations of behaviors that were precisely defined based on detailed analyses of limb kinematics. This type of modulation may be a key mechanism that allows the ACC to modify behavioral output based on emotional states and contextual demands.",

    "abstract": "Recombination events establish the patterns of haplotypic structure in a population and estimates of recombination rates are used in several downstream population and statistical genetic analyses. Using suboptimal maps from distantly related populations may reduce the efficacy of genomic analyses, particularly for underrepresented populations such as the Native Hawaiians. To overcome this challenge, we constructed recombination maps using genome-wide array data from two study samples of Native Hawaiians: one reflecting the current admixed state of Native Hawaiians (NH map), and one based on individuals of enriched Polynesian ancestries (PNS map) with the potential to be used for less admixed Polynesian populations such as the Samoans. We found the recombination landscape to be less correlated with those from other continental populations (e.g. Spearmans rho = 0.79 between PNS and CEU (Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry) compared to 0.92 between YRI (Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria) and CEU at 50 kb resolution), likely driven by the unique demographic history of the Native Hawaiians. PNS also shared the fewest recombination hotspots with other populations (e.g. 8% of hotspots shared between PNS and CEU compared to 27% of hotspots shared between YRI and CEU). We found that downstream analyses in the Native Hawaiian population, such as local ancestry inference, imputation, and IBD segment and relatedness detections, would achieve similar efficacy when using the NH map compared to an omnibus map. However, for genome scans of adaptive loci using integrated haplotype scores, we found several loci with apparent genome-wide significant signals (|Z-score| > 4) in Native Hawaiians that would not have been significant when analyzed using NH-specific maps. Population-specific recombination maps may therefore improve the robustness of haplotype-based statistics and help us better characterize the evolutionary history that may underlie Native Hawaiian-specific health conditions that persist today.",

    "abstract": "The role of the intestinal microbiota in host health is increasingly revealed in its contributions to disease states. The host-microbiome interaction is multifactorial and dynamic. One of the factors that has recently been strongly associated with host physiological responses is peptidoglycan from bacterial cell walls. Peptidoglycan from gut commensal bacteria activate peptidoglycan sensors in human cells, including the Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing protein 2 (NOD2). When present in the gastrointestinal tract, both the polymeric form (sacculi) and de-polymerized fragments can modulate host physiology including checkpoint anticancer therapy efficacy, body temperature and appetite, and postnatal growth. To leverage this growing area of biology towards therapeutic prescriptions, it will be critical to directly analyze sacculi from living hosts in a reproducible and non-invasive way. Here we show that peptidoglycan/sacculi can be readily isolated from fecal samples of mice and humans. Analysis of fecal samples provided a non-invasive route to probe the gut commensal community including the metabolic synchronicity with the host circadian clock. Together, these results pave the way for non-invasive diagnostic tools to emerge that inform on the causal nature of peptidoglycan in host health and disease.",

    "abstract": "How do we gain general insights from limited novel experiences? Humans and animals have a striking ability to learn relationships between experienced items, enabling efficient generalization and rapid assimilation of new information. One fundamental instance of such relational learning is transitive inference (learn A>B and B>C, infer A>C), which can be quickly and globally reorganized upon learning a new item (learn A>B>C and D>E>F, then C>D, and infer B>E). Despite considerable study, neural mechanisms of transitive inference and fast reassembly of existing knowledge remain elusive. Here we adopt a meta-learning (\"learning-to-learn\") approach. We train artificial neural networks, endowed with synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation, to be able to learn novel orderings of arbitrary stimuli from repeated presentation of stimulus pairs. We then obtain a complete mechanistic understanding of this discovered neural learning algorithm. Remarkably, this learning involves active cognition: items from previous trials are selectively reinstated in working memory, enabling delayed, self-generated learning and knowledge reassembly. These findings identify a new mechanism for relational learning and insight, suggest new interpretations of neural activity in cognitive tasks, and highlight a novel approach to discovering neural mechanisms capable of supporting cognitive behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease with a strong genetic basis. Despite the identification of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the SLC15A4 gene that are significantly associated with SLE across multiple populations, specific causal SNP(s) and molecular mechanisms responsible for disease susceptibility are unknown. To address this gap, we employed bioinformatics, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), and 3D chromatin interaction analysis to nominate a likely functional variant, rs35907548, in an active intronic enhancer of SLC15A4. Through luciferase reporter assays followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR, we observed significant allele-specific enhancer effects of rs35907548 in diverse cell lines. The rs35907548 risk allele T is associated with increased regulatory activity and target gene expression, as shown by eQTLs and chromosome conformation capture (3C)-qPCR. The latter revealed long-range chromatin interactions between the rs35907548 enhancer and the promoters of SLC15A4, GLTLD1, and an uncharacterized lncRNA. The enhancer-promoter interactions and expression effects were validated by CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out (KO) of the locus in HL60 promyeloblast cells. KO cells also displayed dramatically dysregulated endolysosomal pH regulation. Together, our data show that the rs35907548 risk allele affects multiple aspects of cellular physiology and may directly contribute to SLE.",

Global knockout of Ccl2 reduces plaque formation and macrophage content in mice, but the importance of different plaque cell types in mediating this effect has not been resolved. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) can adopt a potentially pro-inflammatory function with expression of CCL2. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that SMC-secreted CCL2 is involved in early atherogenesis in mice.\n\nMethodsSMC-restricted Cre recombinase was activated at 6 weeks of age in mice with homozygous floxed or wildtype Ccl2 alleles. Separate experiments in mice lacking the Cre recombinase transgene were conducted to control for genetic background effects. Hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis were induced by a tail vein injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) encoding proprotein convertase subtilisin /kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and a high-fat diet for 12 weeks.\n\nResultsUnexpectedly, mice with SMC-specific Ccl2 deletion developed higher levels of plasma cholesterol and larger atherosclerotic plaques with more macrophages compared with wild-type littermates. When total cholesterol levels were incorporated into the statistical analysis, none of the effects on plaque development between groups remained significant. Importantly, changes in plasma cholesterol and atherosclerosis remained in mice lacking Cre recombinase indicating that they were not caused by SMC-specific CCL2 deletion but by effects of the floxed allele or passenger genes.\n\nConclusionsSMC-specific deficiency of Ccl2 does not significantly affect plaque development in hypercholesterolemic mice.",

With consumer demand for green products, the fermentative production of butyric acid by microorganisms such as Clostridium is attracting interest. Clostridium butyricum ferments non-digested dietary fibre in the colon to produce butyrate which has multiple health benefits, and certain strains are exploited as probiotics, such as MIYAIRI588 (CBM588). Knowledge of the genes encoding enzymes involved in butyrate production and determining those that are rate-limiting due to low concentrations, could enable strain engineering for higher yields. To this end whole genome sequencing of CBM588 was performed and a circular chromosome, a megaplasmid and the previously reported cryptic plasmid, pCBM588, identified. All genes involved in the butyrate production pathway were found on the chromosome. To identify rate-limiting steps, the relative abundance of the encoded enzymes was assessed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) of total cytosolic proteins. Phosphotransbutyrylase (Ptb) was the least abundant closely followed by butyrate kinase (Buk) and crotonase (Crt). Analysis of upstream regulatory sequences revealed the potential importance of an intact Shine-Dalgarno sequence.

By employing matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), the method has realized an enhancement in spatial resolution that surpasses the conventional resolution limits of commercial instruments by approximately 4.5 folds. This allows for the detailed visualization of fine structures in the mouse brain, testis, and liver.

    "abstract": "Purpose: To test cefiderocol, a siderophore-cephalosporin antibiotic for topical monotherapy treatment of experimental extensively drug resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis. Design: Preclinical study. Subjects and Controls: Deidentified P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates, XDR P. aeruginosa from eye drop outbreak, rabbits, saline, cefiderocol 50 mg/ml, ciprofloxacin 0.3%, and tobramycin 14 mg/ml. Methods, Intervention, or Testing: Cefiderocol antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates (n=135) was evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing. Ocular toxicity/tolerability and antibacterial efficacy were tested in vivo with experimental rabbit models. Main Outcome Measures: MIC analysis for susceptibility, graded tests for ocular toxicity/tolerability, CFU analysis for bacterial burden, corneal cefiderocol concentrations. Results: 100% of P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates were susceptible to cefiderocol (n=135), the MIC90 was 0.125 ug/ml including the XDR isolate (MIC = 0.125 ug/ml). Topical cefiderocol 50 mg/ml was minimally toxic to the ocular surface and was well tolerated. For the XDR P. aeruginosa isolate, topical cefiderocol 50 mg/ml, significantly decreased corneal CFU compared to ciprofloxacin 0.3%, tobramycin 14 mg/ml, and saline. In addition, tobramycin 14 mg/ml was more effective than the saline control. Mean cefiderocol corneal concentrations were 191x greater than the MIC90 of the P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that cefiderocol is well tolerated on rabbit corneas and is effective against P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates in vitro and was effective in vivo against an XDR isolate. Given the recent outbreak of keratitis caused by this XDR P. aeruginosa, cefiderocol is a promising additional antibiotic that should be further evaluated for topical treatment of keratitis caused by antibiotic resistant P. aeruginosa.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To test cefiderocol, a siderophore-cephalosporin antibiotic for topical monotherapy treatment of experimental extensively drug resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis. Design: Preclinical study. Subjects and Controls: Deidentified P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates, XDR P. aeruginosa from eye drop outbreak, rabbits, saline, cefiderocol 50 mg/ml, ciprofloxacin 0.3%, and tobramycin 14 mg/ml. Methods, Intervention, or Testing: Cefiderocol antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates (n=135) was evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing. Ocular toxicity/tolerability and antibacterial efficacy were tested in vivo with experimental rabbit models. Main Outcome Measures: MIC analysis for susceptibility, graded tests for ocular toxicity/tolerability, CFU analysis for bacterial burden, corneal cefiderocol concentrations. Results: 100% of P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates were susceptible to cefiderocol (n=135), the MIC90 was 0.125 ug/ml including the XDR isolate (MIC = 0.125 ug/ml). Topical cefiderocol 50 mg/ml was minimally toxic to the ocular surface and was well tolerated. For the XDR P. aeruginosa isolate, topical cefiderocol 50 mg/ml, significantly decreased corneal CFU compared to ciprofloxacin 0.3%, tobramycin 14 mg/ml, and saline. In addition, tobramycin 14 mg/ml was more effective than the saline control. Mean cefiderocol corneal concentrations were 191x greater than the MIC90 of the P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that cefiderocol is well tolerated on rabbit corneas and is effective against P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates in vitro and was effective in vivo against an XDR isolate. Given the recent outbreak of keratitis caused by this XDR P. aeruginosa, cefiderocol is a promising additional antibiotic that should be further evaluated for topical treatment of keratitis caused by antibiotic resistant P. aeruginosa.",

    "abstract": "Sperm competition can drive the rapid evolution of male reproductive traits, but it remains unclear how variation in sperm competition intensity shapes phenotypic and molecular diversity across clades. Old World mice and rats (subfamily Murinae) comprise one of the most rapid mammalian radiations and exhibit incredible diversity in sperm morphology and production. We sequenced exomes from 36 murine species and combined these data with published sequences to model the evolution of reproductive traits and genes across 78 murine species. We identified several independent shifts towards smaller relative testes mass, a trait reflective of reduced sperm competition. Several features of sperm morphology were associated with relative testes mass, suggesting that mating system evolution likely selects for convergent suites of traits related to sperm competitive ability. Molecular evolutionary rates of spermatogenesis proteins also correlated with relative testes mass, but in an unexpected direction. We predicted that sperm competition would result in rapid divergence among species with large relative testes mass, but instead found that many spermatogenesis genes evolve more rapidly in species with smaller relative testes mass due to relaxed purifying selection. While some reproductive genes showed evidence for pervasive positive selection, relaxed selection played a greater role underlying rapid evolution in small testes species. Our work demonstrates that sexual selection can impose strong purifying selection shaping the evolution of male reproduction.",

    "abstract": "Ancestral state estimation is a formal phylogenetic method for inferring the nature of ancestors and performing tests of character evolution. As such, it is among the most important tools available to evolutionary biologists. However, there are a profusion of methods available, the accuracy of which remains unclear. Here I use a simulation approach to test between parsimony and likelihood methods for estimating ancestral states from discrete binary characters. I simulate 500 characters using 15 different Markov generating models, a range of tree sizes (8-256 tips) and three topologies representing end members of tree symmetry and branch length heterogeneity. Simulated tip states were subject to ancestral state estimation under the Equal Rates (ER) and All-Rates-Different (ARD) models, as well as under parsimony assuming accelerated transformations (ACCTRAN). The results demonstrate that both parsimony and likelihood approaches obtain high accuracy applied to trees with more tips. Parsimony performs poorly when trees contain long branches, whereas the ER model performs well across simulations and is reasonably robust to model violation. The ER model frequently outperforms the ARD model, even when data are simulated using unequal rates. Furthermore, the ER model exhibits less transition rate error when compared to ER models. These results suggest that ARD models may be overparameterized when character data is limited. Surprisingly, difference in error between likelihood models is a poor predictor of difference in model fitness; better fitting models are not necessarily more accurate. However there is a strong correlation between model uncertainty and model error; likelihood models with more certain ancestral state estimates are typically more accurate. Using empirical morphological datasets, I demonstrate that applying different methods often results in substantively different ancestral state estimates. However, ER ancestral state estimates are frequently supported by either parsimony or ARD estimates. Finally, I highlight the importance of incorporating fossils in ancestral state estimation. Fossils increase the total number of tips, break long branches and lower average branch length and overall branch length heterogeneity of trees. These factors will all contribute to increasing the accuracy of ancestral state estimates, irrespective of the method used.",

    "abstract": "The default mode network (DMN) is a large-scale brain network known to be suppressed during a wide range of cognitive tasks. However, our comprehension of its role in naturalistic and unconstrained behaviors has remained elusive because most research on the DMN has been conducted within the restrictive confines of MRI scanners. Here we use multisite GCaMP fiber photometry with simultaneous videography to probe DMN function in awake, freely exploring rats. We examined neural dynamics in three core DMN nodes -- the retrosplenial cortex, cingulate cortex, and prelimbic cortex -- as well as the anterior insula node of the salience network, and their association with the rats' spatial exploration behaviors. We found that DMN nodes displayed a hierarchical functional organization during spatial exploration, characterized by stronger coupling with each other than with the anterior insula. Crucially, these DMN nodes encoded the kinematics of spatial exploration, including linear and angular velocity. Additionally, we identified latent brain states that encoded distinct patterns of time-varying exploration behaviors and discovered that higher linear velocity was associated with enhanced DMN activity, heightened synchronization among DMN nodes, and increased anticorrelation between the DMN and anterior insula. Our findings highlight the involvement of the DMN in collectively and dynamically encoding spatial exploration in a real-world setting. Our findings challenge the notion that the DMN is primarily a 'task-negative' network disengaged from the external world. By illuminating the DMN's role in naturalistic behaviors, our study underscores the importance of investigating brain network function in ecologically valid contexts.",

    "abstract": "Cortical neurons exhibit multiple timescales related to dynamics of spontaneous fluctuations (intrinsic timescales) and response to task events (seasonal timescales) in addition to selectivity to task-relevant signals. These timescales increase systematically across the cortical hierarchy, e.g., from parietal to prefrontal and cingulate cortex, pointing to their role in cortical computations. It is currently unknown whether these timescales depend on training in a specific task and/or are an inherent property of neurons, and whether more fine-grained hierarchies of timescales exist within specific cortical regions. To address these questions, we analyzed single-cell recordings within five subregions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of male macaques before and after training on a working-memory task. We found fine-grained but opposite gradients of intrinsic and seasonal timescales that mainly appeared after training. Intrinsic timescales decreased whereas seasonal timescales increased from posterior to anterior subregions within both dorsal and ventral PFC. Moreover, training was accompanied by increases in proportions of neurons that exhibited intrinsic and seasonal timescales. These effects were comparable to the emergence of response selectivity due to training. Finally, task selectivity accompanied opposite neural dynamics such that neurons with task-relevant selectivity exhibited longer intrinsic and shorter seasonal timescales. Notably, neurons with longer intrinsic and shorter seasonal timescales exhibited superior population-level coding, but these advantages extended to the delay period mainly after training. Together, our results provide evidence for plastic, fine-grained gradients of timescales within PFC that can influence both single-cell and population coding, pointing to the importance of these timescales in understanding cognition.",

    "abstract": "Aim: Conservationists and managers must direct resources and enact measures to protect species, despite uncertainty about their present statuses. One approach to covering the data gap is borrowing information from data-rich species or populations to guide decisions about data-poor ones, via machine learning. Recent efforts demonstrated proof-of-concept at the global scale, leaving unclear whether similar approaches are feasible at the local and regional scales at which conservation actions most typically occur. To address this gap, we tested a global-scale predictive approach at a regional scale, using two groups of taxa. Location: Maryland, USA. Taxa: Vascular land plants and lepidopterans. Methods: Using publicly available occurrence and biogeographic data, we trained random forest classifiers to predict the state-level conservation status of species in each of the two focal taxa. We assessed model performance with cross-validation, and explored trends in the predictions. Results: Our models had strong discriminatory ability, accurately predicting status for species with existing status assessments. They predict that the northwestern part of Maryland, USA, which overlaps the Appalachian Mountains, harbors a higher concentration of unassessed, but threatened plants and lepidopterans. Our predictions track known biogeographic patterns, and unassessed species predicted as most likely threatened in Maryland were often recognized as also needing conservation in nearby jurisdictions, providing external validation to our results. Main Conclusions: We demonstrate that a modelling approach developed for global analysis can be downscaled and credible when applied at a regional scale that is smaller than typical species ranges. We identified select unassessed plant and lepidopteran species, and the western, montane region of Maryland as priority targets for additional monitoring, assessment, and conservation. By rapidly aggregating disparate data and integrating information across taxa, models like those we used can complement traditional assessment tools and assist in prioritization for formal assessments, as well as protection.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogels generally have broad utilization in healthcare due to their tunable structures, high water content, and inherent biocompatibility. FDA-approved applications of hydrogels include spinal cord regeneration, skin fillers, and local therapeutic delivery. Drawbacks exist in the clinical hydrogel space, largely pertaining to inconsistent therapeutic exposure, short-lived release windows, and difficulties inserting the polymer into tissue. In this study, we engineered injectable, biocompatible hydrogels that function as a local protein therapeutic depot with a high degree of user-customizability. We showcase a PEG-based hydrogel functionalized with bioorthogonal strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) handles for its polymerization and functionalization with a variety of payloads. Small-molecule and protein cargos, including chemokines and antibodies, were site-specifically modified with hydrolysable azidoesters of varying hydrophobicity via direct chemical conjugation or sortase-mediated transpeptidation. These hydrolysable esters afforded extended releases of payloads linked to our hydrogels, with timescales spanning days to months dependent on ester hydrophobicity. Injected hydrogels polymerize in situ and remain in tissue over extended periods of time. Hydrogel-delivered protein payloads elicit biological activity after being modified with SPAAC-compatible linkers, as demonstrated by the successful recruitment of murine T-cells to a mouse melanoma model by hydrolytically released murine CXCL10. These results highlight a highly versatile, customizable hydrogel-based delivery system for local delivery of protein therapeutics with payload release profiles appropriate for a variety of clinical needs.",

    "abstract": "Protein kinase function and interactions with drugs are controlled in part by the movement of the DFG and C-Helix motifs, which enable kinases to adopt various conformational states. Small molecule ligands elicit therapeutic effects with distinct selectivity profiles and residence times that often depend on the kinase conformation(s) they bind. However, the limited availability of experimentally determined structural data for kinases in inactive states restricts drug discovery efforts for this major protein family. Modern AI-based structural modeling methods hold potential for exploring the previously experimentally uncharted druggable conformational space for kinases. Here, we first evaluated the currently explored conformational space of kinases in the PDB and models generated by AlphaFold2 (AF2) and ESMFold, two prominent AI-based structure prediction methods. We then investigated AF2's ability to predict kinase structures in different conformations at various multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depths, based on this parameter's ability to explore conformational diversity. Our results showed a bias within the PDB and predicted structural models generated by AF2 and ESMFold toward structures of kinases in the active state over alternative conformations, particularly those conformations controlled by the DFG motif. Finally, we demonstrate that predicting kinase structures using AF2 at lower MSA depths allows the exploration of the space of these alternative conformations, including identifying previously unobserved conformations for 398 kinases. The results of our analysis of structural modeling by AF2 create a new avenue for the pursuit of new therapeutic agents against a notoriously difficult-to-target family of proteins.",

    "abstract": "Slow waves (SWs) represent the most prominent electrophysiological events in the thalamocortical system under anesthesia and during deep sleep. Recent studies have revealed that SWs have complex spatiotemporal dynamics and propagate across neocortical regions. However, it is still unclear whether neuronal activity in the thalamus exhibits similar propagation properties during SWs. Here, we report propagating population activity in the thalamus of ketamine/xylazine-anesthetized rats and mice visualized by high-density silicon probe recordings. In both rodent species, propagation of spontaneous thalamic activity during up-states was most frequently observed in dorsal thalamic nuclei such as the higher order posterior (Po), lateral posterior (LP) or laterodorsal (LD) nuclei. The preferred direction of thalamic activity spreading was along the dorsoventral axis, with over half of the up-states exhibiting a gradual propagation in the ventral-to-dorsal direction. Furthermore, simultaneous neocortical and thalamic recordings demonstrated that there is a weak but noticeable interrelation between propagation patterns observed during cortical up-states and those displayed by thalamic population activity. In addition, using chronically implanted silicon probes, we detected propagating activity patterns in the thalamus of naturally sleeping rats during slow-wave sleep. However, in comparison to propagating up-states observed under anesthesia, these propagating patterns were characterized by a reduced rate of occurrence and a faster propagation speed. Our findings suggest that the propagation of spontaneous population activity is an intrinsic property of the thalamocortical network during synchronized brain states such as deep sleep or anesthesia. Additionally, our data implies that the neocortex may have partial control over the formation of propagation patterns within the dorsal thalamus.",

    "abstract": "Sexual selection, one of the central pillars of evolutionary theory, has powerful effects on organismal morphology, behaviour and population dynamics. However, current knowledge about geographical variation in this evolutionary mechanism and its underlying drivers remains highly incomplete, in part because standardized data on the strength of sexual selection is sparse even for well-studied organisms. Here we use information on mating systems - including the incidence of polygamy and extra-pair paternity - to quantify the intensity of sexual selection in 10671 (>99.9%) bird species distributed worldwide. We show that avian sexual selection varies latitudinally, peaking at higher latitudes, although the gradient is reversed in the world's most sexually selected birds - specialist frugivores - which are strongly associated with tropical forests. Phylogenetic models further reveal that the strength of sexual selection is explained by temperature seasonality coupled with a suite of climate-associated factors, including migration, diet, and territoriality. Overall, these analyses suggest that climatic conditions leading to short, intense breeding seasons, or highly abundant and patchy food resources, increase the potential for polygamy in birds, driving latitudinal gradients in sexual selection. Our findings help to resolve longstanding debates about spatial variation in evolutionary mechanisms linked to reproductive biology, and provide a comprehensive species-level dataset for further studies of selection and phenotypic evolution in the context of global climatic change.",

    "abstract": "Magnetogenetics represents a method for remote control of cellular function. Despite successful use of magnetic fields to control gene expression in vitro and in vivo, the mechanism underlying magnetogenetics is largely unknown, thereby hindering further development and applications. Previous work suggests a chemical-based mechanism involving the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a platform initiator and downstream signaling molecule. Herein, a chemical biology approach was used to elucidate further the mechanism of radio frequency-alternating magnetic field (RF-AMF) stimulation of a TRPV1-ferritin magnetogenetics platform that leads to Ca2+ gating. RF-AMF stimulation of HEK 293T cells expressing TRPV1-Ferritin resulted in a ~30% and ~140% increase in intra- and extracellular ROS levels, respectively. Mutations to specific cysteine residues in TRPV1 responsible for ROS sensitivity eliminated RF-AMF driven Ca2+-dependent transcription of secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP). Using a non-tethered (to TRPV1) ferritin also eliminated RF-AMF driven SEAP production. These results suggest ferritin-dependent ROS activation of TRPV1 plays a key role in the initiation of magnetogenetics. Furthermore, inhibition of IP3R-based endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ release with Xestospongin C, inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) activity with Go 6983, or inhibition of NADPH oxidase (NOX) isoforms 1/2 gp91phox cytochrome with GSK 2795039 eliminated short-term RF-AMF potentiation of SEAP production with capsaicin. Similarly, Go 6983 significantly reduced long-term RF-AMF capsaicin potentiation of SEAP production. These results suggest that ROS-activated TRPV1 signaling to increase intracellular Ca2+ includes pathways involving PKC, NOX, and the ER. Together, these findings fill in current knowledge gaps in the mechanism of magnetogenetics, which may lead to translational applications in medicine and biotechnology.",

However, simple monofractal characterisations fail to capture the complexity of multiscale interactions in developing biological systems. Here we show that multifractal techniques, effectively capture the complex patterns of self-similarity in a dimensionally reduced, usable way.

Despite their importance, the lack of comprehensive tools for studying PTMs from a pathway-centric perspective has limited our ability to understand how PTMs modulate cellular pathways on a molecular level. Here, we present PTMNavigator, a tool integrated into the ProteomicsDB platform, which offers an interactive interface for researchers to overlay experimental PTM data on top of ~3000 well-curated pathway diagrams. This offers a comprehensive view of the intricate relationship between PTMs and signaling pathways. To demonstrate the utility of PTMNavigator, we applied it to two phosphoproteomics perturbation datasets. First, PTMNavigator enhanced pathway enrichment analysis by showing how the regulated peptides are distributed in the pathways with high enrichment scores. Second, it visualized how drug treatments result in a discernable flow of PTM-driven signaling within pathways. Third, PTMNavigator aided in extending existing pathways by uncovering previously unknown relationships between PTMs and pathway components. By facilitating the discovery of novel PTM-pathway interactions and enhancing our understanding of cellular signaling dynamics, PTMNavigator advances our knowledge of PTM biology and its implications in health and disease.",

The bilaminar disc of pig embryos mirrors humans, making them a useful proxy for studying gastrulation. Here we present a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of pig gastrulation, revealing cell-fate emergence dynamics, as well as conserved and divergent gene programs governing early porcine, primate, and murine development. We highlight heterochronicity in extraembryonic cell-type development, despite the broad conservation of cell-type-specific transcriptional programs. We apply these findings in combination with functional investigations, to outline conserved spatial, molecular, and temporal events during definitive endoderm (DE). We find early FOXA2+/TBXT- embryonic disc cells directly from DE, contrasting later-emerging FOXA2/TBXT+ node/notochord progenitors. Unlike mesoderm, none of these progenitors undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. DE/Node fate hinges on balanced WNT and hypoblast-derived NODAL, which is extinguished upon DE differentiation. These findings emphasise the interplay between temporal and topological signalling in early fate decisions during gastrulation.",

    "abstract": "Background: The intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) is a crucial but understudied regulator of cardiac myocyte function. The Na+/K+ ATPase (NKA) controls the steady-state [Na+]i and thereby determines the set-point for intracellular Ca2+. Here, we investigate the nanoscopic organization and local adrenergic regulation of the NKA macromolecular complex and how it differentially regulates the intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ homeostases in atrial and ventricular myocytes. Methods: Multicolor STORM super-resolution microscopy, Western Blot analyses, and in vivo examination of adrenergic regulation are employed to examine the organization and function of Na+ nanodomains in cardiac myocytes. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy at high spatiotemporal resolution is used in conjunction with cellular electrophysiology to investigate intracellular Na+ homeostasis in atrial and ventricular myocytes. Results: The NKA1 (NKA1) and the L-type Ca2+-channel (Cav1.2) form a nanodomain with a center-to center distance of ~65 nm in both ventricular and atrial myocytes. NKA1 protein expression levels are ~3 fold higher in atria compared to ventricle. 100% higher atrial INKA, produced by large NKA \"superclusters\", underlies the substantially lower Na+ concentration in atrial myocytes compared to the benchmark values set in ventricular myocytes. The NKA's regulatory protein phospholemman (PLM) has similar expression levels across atria and ventricle resulting in a much lower PLM/NKA1 ratio for atrial compared to ventricular tissue. In addition, a huge PLM phosphorylation reserve in atrial tissue produces a high {beta}-adrenergic sensitivity of INKA in atrial myocytes. {beta}-adrenergic regulation of INKA is locally mediated in the NKA1-Cav1.2 nanodomain via A-kinase anchoring proteins. Conclusions: NKA1, Cav1.2 and their accessory proteins form a structural and regulatory nanodomain at the cardiac dyad. The tissue-specific composition and local adrenergic regulation of this \"signaling cloud\" is a main regulator of the distinct global intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations in atrial and ventricular myocytes.",

Existing models used for embryo quality assessment and chromosomal abnormality (ploidy) detection could be significantly improved by effectively utilizing time-lapse imaging to identify critical developmental time points for maximizing prediction accuracy. Addressing this, we developed and compared various embryo ploidy status prediction models across distinct embryo development stages. We present BELA (Blastocyst Evaluation Learning Algorithm), a state-of-the-art ploidy prediction model surpassing previous image- and video-based models, without necessitating subjective input from embryologists. BELA uses multitask learning to predict quality scores that are used downstream to predict ploidy status. By achieving an AUC of 0.76 for discriminating between euploidy and aneuploidy embryos on the Weill Cornell dataset, BELA matches the performance of models trained on embryologists' manual scores. While not a replacement for preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A), BELA exemplifies how such models can streamline the embryo evaluation process, reducing time and effort required by embryologists.",

Mathematically, it can be modelled as follows: Consider a set of genotypes, each of which contain a set of mutated and unmutated genes. Suppose that a set of growth rate measurements of each genotype under a set of antibiotics are given. The transition probabilities of a 'realization' of a Markov chain associated with each arc under each antibiotic are computable via a predefined function given the growth rate realizations. The aim is to maximize the expected probability of reaching to the genotype with all unmutated genes given the initial genotype in a predetermined number of transitions, considering the following two sources of uncertainties: i) the randomness in growth rates, ii) the randomness in transition probabilities, which are functions of growth rates. We develop stochastic mixed-integer linear programming and dynamic programming approaches to solve static and dynamic versions of the Antibiotics Time Machine Problem under the aforementioned uncertainties. We adapt a Sample Average Approximation approach that exploits the special structure of the problem and provide accurate solutions that perform very well in an out-of-sample analysis.",

Here we developed a streamlined, semi-quantitative approach to assess dendrimer-protein interactions using a non-denaturing electrophoresis technique combined with mass spectrometry. With this protocol, we detect fluorescently tagged dendrimers and proteins simultaneously, enabling us to analyze when dendrimers migrate with proteins.

    "abstract": "Development and function of the heart are crucially controlled by individual genetic factors determining the continuum from health to disease. A prime example of a quantitative pathological phenotype is left ventricular hypoplasia, affecting the left ventricle (LV) and its associated inflow and outflow structures and reducing its size to varying degrees. Current models suggest polygenic contributions on heart development and disease, but we are just beginning to understand the impact of naturally occurring sequence variations. Here we show how natural genetic variants exert cumulative, environment-sensitive effects on both embryonic heart development as well as adult heart function. We addressed this in embryos of five inbred strains of the Japanese rice fish medaka (Oryzias latipes and Oryzias sakaizumii), analyzing heart rates as a functional proxy to capture combined characteristics of the conduction system and structural morphology. We identified one strain, HO5, with embryonic hypoplastic ventricles, fast heart rates, and significantly impaired cardiac function and overall fitness in adults. We created an interpopulation cross of the divergent HO5 strain to HdrR, which exhibits a morphologically normal heart and comparably slow heart rates, to leverage segregation variance in the second filial generation (F2) for genetic mapping. The correlation of 1192 individually phenotyped F2 embryos (heart rate) with the corresponding whole-genome sequences established a single nucleotide polymorphism-based linkage map. Integrated analysis of parental cardiac transcriptomes highlighted 59 loci containing genes prominently linked to human cardiovascular phenotypes. In vivo knockout models of the top 12 candidate genes demonstrated a causal and differential impact on heart development, ventricular size, and heart rate, evidencing the polygenic nature of heart phenotypes and establishing new loci for genetic diagnostics of human congenital heart disease. The controllable and scalable genetics and experimental validation in inbred vertebrate models complement and expand human association studies to provide novel and unique insights into the role of natural genetic variation in the mechanism of cardiac disease and allow to identify genetic susceptibility in individual human subjects.",

    "abstract": "After years of the COVID-19 pandemic, over 40 million children worldwide are at risk of measles due to delayed vaccination and temporary SARS-CoV-2 viral dominance. Acute measles has a case-fatality rate of ~1%, but most morbidity and mortality arise post-measles due to destruction of pre-existing immune memory by lymphotropic measles virus (MeV), a paramyxovirus of the Morbillivirus genus. MeV-induced immune amnesia is not mitigated by post-exposure vaccination and the impact of unrelated respiratory virus disease history on measles severity has not been defined. We used a lethal canine distemper virus (CDV)-ferret model as surrogate for human morbillivirus disease and employed the orally efficacious broad-spectrum paramyxovirus polymerase inhibitor GHP-88309 to establish measles treatment paradigms. Applying a receptor tropism-intact recombinant CDV with low lethality, we provide in vivo confirmation of the morbillivirus immune amnesia hypothesis and reveal an 8-day advantage of antiviral treatment versus therapeutic vaccination in preserving immune memory. Infection of ferrets with non-lethal influenza A virus (IAV) A/CA/07/2009 (H1N1) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) four weeks prior to CDV caused exacerbated CDV disease that rapidly advanced to fatal hemorrhagic pneumonia associated with lung onslaught by commensal bacteria. RNAseq of BAL samples and lung tissue identified CDV-induced expression of trefoil factor (TFF) peptides, which was absent in animals pre-infected with IAV, thus highlighting that immune priming by unrelated respiratory viruses influences morbillivirus infection outcome. Non-invasive pulmonary ferret MRI revealed that severe outcomes of consecutive IAV/CDV infections were prevented by oral GHP-88309 treatment even when initiated after peak clinical signs of CDV. These findings validate the morbillivirus immune amnesia hypothesis, define treatment paradigms for measles, identify prior disease history as risk factor for exacerbated morbillivirus disease, and demonstrate that treating morbillivirus infection with direct-acting oral antivirals provides therapeutic benefit regardless of whether the time window to mitigate primary clinical signs of infection has closed.",

Here we describe a transgenic system for recreating CI in the major arbovirus vector Aedes aegypti using CI factor (cif) genes from wAlbB, a Wolbachia strain currently being deployed to reduce dengue transmission. CI-like sterility was induced when cifA and cifB were co-expressed in testes; this sterility could be rescued by maternal cifA expression, thereby reproducing the pattern of Wolbachia-induced CI. Expression of cifB alone was associated with extensive DNA damage and disrupted spermatogenesis. The strength of rescue by maternal cifA expression was dependent on the comparative levels of cifA/cifB expression in males. These findings are consistent with CifB acting as a toxin and CifA as an antitoxin, with CifA attenuating CifB toxicity in both the male germline and in developing embryos.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial genomes of Apicomplexans comprise merely three protein-coding genes, alongside a set of thirty to forty genes encoding small RNAs (sRNAs), many of which exhibit homologies to rRNA from E. coli. The expression status and integration of these short RNAs into ribosomes remains unclear and direct evidence for active ribosomes within Apicomplexan mitochondria is still lacking. In this study, we conducted small RNA sequencing on the Apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii to investigate the occurrence and function of mitochondrial sRNAs. To enhance the depth of analysis for the sRNA sequencing outcomes, we also re-sequenced the T. gondii mitochondrial genome using an improved organelle enrichment protocol and Nanopore sequencing. It has been established previously that the T. gondii genome comprises 21 sequence blocks that undergo recombination among themselves. We here demonstrate that the arrangement of these sequence blocks follows a non-random pattern characterized by a specific number of combinations. Employing this refined genome for sRNA mapping, we find that many small RNAs originated from the junction sites between protein-coding blocks and rRNA sequence blocks. Surprisingly, such block border sRNAs were incorporated into polysomes together with canonical rRNA fragments. In conclusion, Apicomplexan ribosomes are active within polysomes and are indeed assembled through the integration of sRNAs, including novel sRNAs with merged mRNA-rRNA sequences. Our findings lead to the hypothesis that T. gondii's block-based genome organization enables the dual utilization of mitochondrial sequences as both messenger RNAs and ribosomal RNAs, potentially establishing a link between the regulation of rRNA and mRNA expression.",

    "abstract": "Hepcidin, a peptide hormone that negatively regulates iron metabolism, is expressed by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Erythroferrone (ERFE) is an extracellular protein that binds and inhibits BMP ligands, thus positively regulating iron import by indirectly suppressing hepcidin. This allows for rapid erythrocyte regeneration after blood loss. ERFE belongs to the C1Q/TNF related protein (CTRP) family and is suggested to adopt multiple oligomeric forms: a trimer, a hexamer, and a high molecular weight species. The molecular basis for how ERFE binds BMP ligands and how the different oligomeric states impact BMP inhibition are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that ERFE activity is dependent on the presence of stable dimeric or trimeric ERFE, and that larger species are dispensable for BMP inhibition. Additionally, we used an in-silico approach to identify a helix, termed the ligand binding domain (LBD), that was predicted to bind BMPs and occlude the type I receptor pocket. We provide evidence that the LBD is crucial for activity through luciferase assays and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. Our findings provide new insight into how ERFE oligomerization impacts BMP inhibition, while identifying critical molecular features of ERFE essential for binding BMP ligands.",

Subtractive docking analyses were designed by using a pool of common redundant peptides known as parasites. This rationale helped us differentiate between possibly specific and non-specific bindings. We found notable differences in docking characteristics between different sets of peptides either related to different targets or related to zinc-conditions. The set of zinc-related peptides shows advantageous docking profiles: sharper binding for some positions and distinct exclusive bound residues, including the relevant R248 and R273.

    "abstract": "Regulatory arrest peptides exert cellular functions via mechanisms involving regulated translational arrest. Monitoring substrates, a class of arrest peptides, feedback-regulate the expression of the Sec or YidC protein localization machinery. Previously, only a limited number of monitoring substrates were identified. In this study, we performed a bacterial domain-wide search, followed by in vivo and in vitro analyses, leading to a comprehensive identification of many novel Sec/YidC-related arrest peptides that showed patchy, but widespread, phylogenetic distribution throughout the bacterial domain. Identification of five novel arrest-inducing sequences suggests that bacteria have evolved various arrest-inducing mechanisms. We also identified many arrest peptides that share an R-A-P-P like sequence, suggesting that this sequence could serve as a common evolutionary seed that could overcome the species-specific structures of ribosomes, to evolve arrest peptides. Our comprehensive phylogenetic study revealed that arrest peptide is a prevalent mechanism for the gene regulation of the protein localization machinery.",

    "abstract": "Background: This study focused on the major components of mucus, known as mucins, within the mucosal epithelium of the respiratory system in Iraqi Common Quail. Six quail were utilized in accordance with animal ethics guidelines from the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Al-Qadisiyah. Histological analysis, utilizing H&E staining, aimed to identify key respiratory system structures. PAS plus Alcian blue stains were employed to identify specific carbohydrates in the trachea, bronchi, and lungs. RT-qPCR was used to assess the gene expression levels of MUC1 and MUC4. Results: The trachea and bronchi encompassed four distinct layers: tunica mucosa, tunica submucosa, hyaline cartilage, and tunica adventitia. The mucosa consisted of pseudostratified epithelium that transitioned into simple columnar cells toward the primary and secondary bronchioles. This transition further progressed into simple cuboidal and squamous epithelium at smaller tertiary branches of the secondary bronchioles. Notably, the bronchial tunica submucosa was thinner than the trachea. While hyaline cartilage was prominently present in the trachea, it became fragmented in the bronchi and diminished towards the lungs and secondary bronchioles. Lung tissue was characterized by numerous lobules housing alveoli connected to alveolar ducts and sacs, alongside an intricate network of blood vessels. The respiratory tissues, including the trachea, bronchi, and lungs, exhibited a strong affinity for PAS-combined Alcian blue stains. This confirmed the substantial presence of both acidic and neutral mucins within the epithelial cells and glands. The trachea demonstrated significantly elevated levels of acidic mucins and a concentrated amount? of neutral mucins. Transcriptome analysis indicated the expression of both MUC1 and MUC4 genes. Importantly, MUC4 expression surpassed that of MUC1 in the trachea, bronchi, and lungs. Conclusion: This study highlights the similarity of histological structures in the trachea, bronchi, and lungs of quail to typical avian species. Moreover, it underscored the substantial presence of both acidic and neutral mucins, with MUC4 being the predominant mucin, potentially playing a pivotal role in regulating mucosal barrier functions and interacting with pathogens. Nonetheless, further investigation is warranted to elucidate MUC4's role in respiratory epithelial cells.",

    "abstract": "During viral infection, several dsRNA sensors are activated in the cell and trigger signaling that leads to changes in gene expression. One of these sensors activates an endonuclease, RNase L, that cleaves many types of RNA in the cell. However, how the resultant widespread RNA decay affects gene expression is not fully understood. Here we found that gene expression changes caused by activating dsRNA sensing pathways are tuned by RNase L activation, pointing to intricacy in the innate immune response where multiple inputs are integrated to create an optimized output. We show that RNase-L-dependent RNA fragmentation induces the activation of the Ribotoxic Stress Response, potentially through ribosome collisions. The p38 and JNK pathways that are activated as part of this response promote outcomes that inhibit the virus, such as programmed cell death. We also show that RNase L appears to limit the translation of genes that are regulated by another dsRNA-induced pathway, the Integrated Stress Response. Intriguingly, we found the activity of the generic endonuclease, RNase A, recapitulates many of the same molecular phenotypes as activated RNase L, demonstrating how widespread RNA cleavage events can directly evoke an antiviral program.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-thalassemia is an autosomal recessive monogenic disease with increasing worldwide prevalence. The molecular basis is due to mutation or deletion of one or more duplicated -globin genes, and disease severity is directly related to the number of allelic copies compromised. The most severe form, -thalassemia major (TM), results from loss of all four copies of -globin and has historically resulted in fatality in utero. However, the advent of in utero transfusions now enables the survival of an increasing number of children with TM. Postnatally, patients face challenges similar to {beta}-thalassemia, including severe anemia and erythrotoxicity due to an imbalance of {beta}-globin and -globin chains. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as a therapeutic option is limited by donor availability and potential transplant-related complications. Despite progress in genome editing treatments for {beta}-thalassemia, there is no analogous curative option for patients suffering from -thalassemia. To address this, we designed a novel Cas9/AAV6-mediated genome editing strategy that integrates a functional -globin gene into the {beta}-globin locus in TM patient-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Incorporation of a truncated erythropoietin receptor transgene into the -globin integration cassette dramatically increased erythropoietic output from edited HSPCs and led to the most robust production of -globin, and consequently normal hemoglobin. By directing edited HSPCs toward increased production of clinically relevant RBCs instead of other divergent cell types, this approach has the potential to mitigate the limitations of traditional HSCT for the hemoglobinopathies, including low genome editing and low engraftment rates. These findings support development of a definitive ex vivo autologous genome editing strategy that may be curative for -thalassemia.",

    "abstract": "Oocyte meiosis is arrested at the first prophase stage, until hormonal stimulation triggers progression into the meiotic divisions. This process, called meiotic maturation, depends on extensive post-transcriptional events. In all vertebrates, two bottleneck events orchestrate meiosis resumption: first, the inhibition of PKA and, second, the activation of Cdk1, the master regulator of eukaryotic cell division. However, the molecular events occurring between these two steps are almost unknown. To address this issue, we took advantage of a Cdk1 inhibitor to identify the early events that depend on PKA downregulation and occur independently of Cdk1 activity. Unexpectedly, we show that accumulation of Cyclin B1 and Mos, the kinase responsible for MAPK activation in oocytes, are regulated in an opposing manner by a two-step mechanism. PKA downregulation induces first the accumulation of Cyclin B1 without any increase of its translation, independently of Cdk1 activation. Subsequently, the rate of Cyclin B1 translation increases in response to Cdk1 activation. In contrast, Mos translation begins downstream PKA inhibition, but the protein does not accumulate until Cdk1 is activated. These intertwined regulations create the positive feedback loops required for the full activation of Cdk1. Additionally, we show that two consecutive waves of translation occur during the G2-M transition, the first induced by PKA inhibition and the second by Cdk1 activation. Finally, we demonstrate that Arpp19, the only known early substrate of PKA in Xenopus oocytes, is not involved in the control of these early events. This study reveals that PKA downregulation promotes multiple molecular pathways that converge on the activation of Cdk1 to induce the G2/M transition in vertebrate oocytes.",

    "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a continuous organelle that extends to the periphery of neurons and regulates many neuronal functions including neurite outgrowth, neurotransmission, and synaptic plasticity. Mutations in proteins that control ER shape are linked to the neurodegenerative disorder Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP). However, the ultrastructure and dynamics of the neuronal ER have been under-investigated, particularly at presynaptic terminals. Here we developed new super-resolution and live imaging methods in D. melanogaster larval motor neurons to investigate ER structure at presynaptic terminals from wild-type animals, and in null mutants of the HSP gene Atlastin. Previous studies indicated diffuse localization of an ER lumen marker at Atlastin mutant presynaptic terminals, which was attributed to ER fragmentation. By contrast, we found using an ER membrane marker that the ER in Atlastin mutants formed robust networks. Further, our high-resolution imaging results suggest that overexpression of luminal ER proteins in Atlastin mutants causes their progressive displacement to the cytosol at synapses, perhaps due to proteostatic stress and/or changes in ER membrane integrity. Remarkably, these luminal ER proteins remain correctly localized in cell bodies, axons, and other cell types such as body wall muscles, suggesting that ER tubules at synapses have unique structural and functional characteristics. This displacement phenotype has not been reported in numerous studies of Atlastin in non-neuronal cells, emphasizing the importance of conducting experiments in neurons when investigating the mechanisms leading to upper motor neuron dysfunction in HSP.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons and the deposition in the remaining cells of protein inclusions called Lewy Bodies (LBs). LBs are heterogeneous structures composed of protein and lipid molecules and their main constituent is the presynaptic protein -synuclein. SH-SY5Y cells are neuroblastoma cells commonly used to model PD because they express dopaminergic markers and -synuclein and they can be differentiated into neuronal cells using established protocols. Despite increasing evidence pointing towards a role of lipids in the initiation of PD, limited knowledge is available on the lipidome of undifferentiated and differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. In this study, we show that the levels and chemical properties of negatively charged phospholipids, diacyl glycerol and sphingolipids are specifically altered along the differentiation process of SH-SY5Y cells and that the levels of these lipids' species correlate with those of dopaminergic and neuronal markers. These results are supported by proteomic data showing that the main biological processes affected by the differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells are lipid metabolism and processes associated with neuron maturation. Finally, our results show that electrophysiological activity can be detected in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells at a stage where most of the lipid changes have reached their maximal value. These results provide the first complete and quantitative characterisation of the changes in lipidome associated with the differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells into more neuronal and dopaminergic-like phenotype and serve as a basis for further characterisation of lipid disruptions in association with PD and its risk factors in this dopaminergic-like neuronal cell model.",

Using gene-edited induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model systems, TPM1 knockout was found to augment developmental cell state transitions, as well as TNFa and GTPase signaling pathways, to promote hemogenic endothelial (HE) cell specification and hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) production. Single-cell analyses showed decreased TPM1 expression during human HE specification, suggesting that TPM1 regulated in vivo hematopoiesis via similar mechanisms. Indeed, analyses of a TPM1 gene trap mouse model showed that TPM1 deficiency enhanced the formation of HE during embryogenesis.

The ribosome uses the initiation codon (AUG) and the first bases of the transcript, including a downstream box (DB) sequence, as recognition signals. We used cryo-EM to solve the structures of the uS2-deficient 70S ribosome and the wild-type 70S complex bound to leaderless mRNA (lmRNA) in the presence of fmet-tRNAfMet. Importantly, the uS2-deficient 70S ribosome also lacks protein bS21. The anti-Shine-Dalgarno (aSD) region is supported by bS21, and the absence of the latter causes the aSD to divert from the normal mRNA exit pathway. We identified a {pi}-stacking interaction between a monitor base (1493A) and the first base (A+4) of lmRNA following the AUG and potentially stabilizing it. Coulomb charge flow and swapping along with peristalsis-like dynamics within the mRNA entry channel are likely to facilitate the propagation of lmRNA through the ribosome.",

    "abstract": "Loss-of-function variants in the PRKN gene encoding the ubiquitin E3 ligase PARKIN cause autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson s disease (PD). Extensive in vitro and in vivo studies have reported that PARKIN is involved in multiple pathways of mitochondrial quality control, including mitochondrial degradation and biogenesis. However, these findings are surrounded by substantial controversy due to conflicting experimental data. In addition, the existing PARKIN-deficient mouse models have failed to faithfully recapitulate PD phenotypes. Therefore, we have investigated the mitochondrial role of PARKIN during ageing and in response to stress by employing a series of conditional Parkin knockout mice. We report that PARKIN loss does not affect oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels in the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle of aged mice. We also demonstrate that PARKIN deficiency does not exacerbate the brain defects and the pro-inflammatory phenotype observed in mice carrying high levels of mtDNA mutations. To rule out compensatory mechanisms activated during embryonic development of Parkin-deficient mice, we generated a mouse model where loss of PARKIN was induced in adult dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Surprisingly, also these mice did not show motor impairment or neurodegeneration, and no major transcriptional changes were found in isolated midbrain DA neurons. Finally, we report a patient with compound heterozygous PRKN pathogenic variants that lacks PARKIN and has developed PD. The PARKIN deficiency did not impair OXPHOS activities or induce mitochondrial pathology in skeletal muscle from the patient. Altogether, our results argue that PARKIN is dispensable for OXPHOS function in adult mammalian tissues.",
