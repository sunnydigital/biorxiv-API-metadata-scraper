    "abstract": "In many cooperatively breeding species non-breeding individuals help to rear the offspring of breeders. The physiological mechanisms that regulate such cooperative helping behavior are poorly understood, but may have been co-opted, during the evolution of cooperative breeding, from pre-existing mechanisms that regulated parental care. Key among these may be a role for prolactin. Here we investigate whether natural variation in circulating prolactin levels predicts both parental and helper contributions to nestling provisioning in cooperatively breeding white-browed sparrow weavers, Plocepasser mahali. In sparrow weaver groups, a single dominant pair monopolize reproduction and non-breeding subordinates help with nestling feeding. We show that: (i) among parents, dominant females feed nestlings at higher rates, make longer provisioning visits, and have higher prolactin levels than dominant males; and (ii) among subordinates, engaged in cooperative helping behavior, those within their natal groups feed nestlings at higher rates and have higher prolactin levels than immigrants. Accordingly, continuous variation in prolactin levels positively predicts nestling-provisioning rates and mean provisioning visit durations when all bird classes are combined. These relationships are principally driven by differences among bird classes in both circulating prolactin levels and provisioning traits. The more limited within-class variation in prolactin and provisioning traits were not evidently correlated, highlighting a likely role for additional mechanisms in the fine-scale regulation of care. Our findings broadly support the hypothesis that parental care and cooperative helping behavior are regulated by a common underlying mechanism and highlight the need for experimentation to now establish the causality of any role for prolactin.",

    "abstract": "Biomarkers of biological age that predict the risk of disease and expected lifespan better than chronological age are key to efficient and cost-effective healthcare1-3. To advance a personalized approach to healthcare, such biomarkers must perform on the individual rather than population level, demonstrate single cell resolution, and provide scalable and cost-effective measurements. We developed a novel approach - image-based chromatin and epigenetic age (ImAge), that utilizes image texture features based on the patterns of chromatin and epigenetic marks in single nuclei. We observed the emergence of intrinsic trajectories of ImAge using dimensionality reduction without regression on chronological age. ImAge was correlated with chronological age in all tissues and organs examined and was consistent with the expected acceleration and/or deceleration of biological age in chronologically identical mice treated with chemotherapy or following a caloric restriction regimen, respectively. ImAge from chronologically identical mice inversely correlated with their locomotor activity (greater activity for younger ImAge), consistent with the essential role of locomotion as an aging biomarker. Finally, we demonstrated that ImAge is reduced upon partial reprogramming in vivo following transient expression of OSKM cassette in the liver and skeletal muscles of old mice and validated the power of ImAge to assess the heterogeneity of reprogramming. We propose that ImAge represents the first-in-class individual-level biomarker of aging and rejuvenation with single-cell resolution.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence has implicated impaired extracellular matrix (ECM) clearance as a key factor in fibrotic disease. Despite decades of research elucidating the effectors of ECM clearance, relatively little is understood regarding the upstream regulation of this process. Collagen is the most abundant constituent of normal and fibrotic ECM in mammalian tissues. Its catabolism occurs through extracellular proteolysis and cell-mediated uptake of collagen fragments for intracellular degradation. Given the paucity of information regarding the regulation of this latter process, we executed unbiased genome-wide screens to understand the molecular underpinnings of cell-mediated collagen clearance. Using this approach, we discovered a previously unappreciated mechanism through which collagen biosynthesis is sensed by cells internally and directly regulates clearance of extracellular collagen. The sensing mechanism is dependent on endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein SEL1L and occurs via a noncanonical function of SEL1L. This pathway functions as a homeostatic negative feedback loop that limits collagen accumulation in tissues. In human fibrotic lung disease, the induction of this collagen clearance pathway by collagen synthesis is impaired, thereby contributing to the pathological accumulation of collagen in lung tissue. Thus cell-autonomous, rheostatic collagen clearance is a previously unidentified pathway of tissue homeostasis.",

However, inter-species genomic differences limit the joint analysis of cross-species datasets to homologous genes. Here, we present SATURN, a deep learning method for learning universal cell embeddings that encodes genes biological properties using protein language models. By coupling protein embeddings from language models with RNA expression, SATURN integrates datasets profiled from different species regardless of their genomic similarity. SATURN has a unique ability to detect functionally related genes co-expressed across species, redefining differential expression for cross-species analysis. We apply SATURN to three species whole-organism atlases and frog and zebrafish embryogenesis datasets. We show that cell embeddings learnt in SATURN can be effectively used to transfer annotations across species and identify both homologous and species-specific cell types, even across evolutionarily remote species. Finally, we use SATURN to reannotate the five species Cell Atlas of Human Trabecular Meshwork and Aqueous Outflow Structures and find evidence of potentially divergent functions between glaucoma associated genes in humans and other species.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive weakness of almost all skeletal muscles, whereas extraocular muscles (EOMs) are comparatively spared. While hindlimb and diaphragm muscles of end-stage SOD1G93A (G93A) mice (a familial ALS mouse model) exhibit severe denervation and depletion of Pax7+ satellite cells (SCs), we found that the pool of SCs and the integrity of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are maintained in EOMs. In cell sorting profiles, SCs derived from hindlimb and diaphragm muscles of G93A mice exhibit denervation-related activation, whereas SCs from EOMs of G93A mice display spontaneous (non-denervation-related) activation, similar to SCs from wild-type mice. Specifically, cultured EOM SCs contain more abundant transcripts of axon guidance molecules, including Cxcl12, along with more sustainable renewability than the diaphragm and hindlimb counterparts under differentiation pressure. In neuromuscular co-culture assays, AAV-delivery of Cxcl12 to G93A-hindlimb SC-derived myotubes enhances motor neuron axon extension and innervation, recapitulating the innervation capacity of EOM SC-derived myotubes. G93A mice fed with sodium butyrate (NaBu) supplementation exhibited less NMJ loss in hindlimb and diaphragm muscles. Additionally, SCs derived from G93A hindlimb and diaphragm muscles displayed elevated expression of Cxcl12 and improved renewability following NaBu treatment in vitro. Thus, the NaBu-induced transcriptomic changes resembling the patterns of EOM SCs may underlie the beneficial effects observed in G93A mice. More broadly, the distinct transcriptomic profile of EOM SCs may offer novel therapeutic targets to slow progressive neuromuscular functional decay in ALS and provide possible \"response biomarkers\" in pre-clinical and clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "The chronic consumption of caloric dense high-fat foods is a major contributor to increased body weight, obesity, and other chronic health conditions. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical in guiding decisions about food intake and is altered with diet-induced obesity. Obese rodents have altered morphological and synaptic electrophysiological properties in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC). Yet the time course by which exposure to a high-fat diet (HFD) induces these changes is poorly understood. Here male mice are exposed to either short- (7 day) or long-term (90 day) HFD. Long-term HFD exposure increases body weight, and glucose signaling compared to short-term HFD or a standard chow control diet (SCD). Both short and long-term HFD exposure increased the excitability of lOFC pyramidal neurons. However, phasic and tonic GABAergic signalling was differentially altered depending on HFD exposure length, such that tonic GABAergic signaling was decreased with early exposure to the HFD and phasic signaling was changed with long-term diet exposure. Furthermore, alterations in the short-term diet exposure were transient, as removal of the diet restored electrophysiological characteristics similar to mice fed SCD whereas long-term HFD electrophysiological changes were persistent and remained after HFD removal. Finally, we demonstrate that changes in reward devaluation occur early with diet exposure. Together, these results suggest that the duration of HFD exposure differentially alters lOFC function and provides mechanistic insights into the susceptibility of the OFC to impairments in outcome devaluation.\n\nSignificant statementThis study provides mechanistic insight on the impact of short- and long-term high fat diet (HFD) exposure on GABAergic function in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), a region known to guide decision making. We find short-term HFD exposure induces transient changes in firing and tonic GABA action on lOFC pyramidal neurons, whereas long-term HFD induces obesity and has lasting changes on firing, tonic GABA and inhibitory synaptic transmission onto lOFC neurons. Given that GABAergic signaling in the lOFC can influence decision making around food, these results have important implications in present society as palatable energy dense foods are abundantly available.",

    "abstract": "The selective introduction of amine groups within deconstruction products of lignin could provide an avenue for valorizing waste biomass while achieving a green synthesis of industrially relevant building blocks from sustainable sources. Here, we built and characterized enzyme cascades that create aldehydes and subsequently primary amines from diverse lignin-derived carboxylic acids using a carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and an {omega}-transaminase (TA). Unlike previous studies that have paired CAR and TA enzymes, here we examine multiple homologs of each of these enzymes and a broader set of candidate substrates. In addition, we compare the performance of these systems in cell-free and resting whole-cell biocatalysis formats using the conversion of vanillate to vanillyl amine as model chemistry. We also demonstrate that resting whole cells can be recycled for multiple batch reactions. We used the knowledge gained from this study to produce several amines from carboxylic acid precursors using one-pot biocatalytic reactions, several of which we report for the first time. These results expand our knowledge of these industrially relevant enzyme families to new substrates and contexts for environmentally friendly and potentially low-cost synthesis of diverse aryl aldehydes and amines.",

    "abstract": "Megaherbivores are primary consumers who provide unique ecosystem services. Given their body size, they are disproportionately threatened in the Anthropocene. Asian elephants are the largest extant terrestrial megaherbivores native to Asia, with 60% of the population found in India. Despite their ecological and cultural importance, the management/conservation units, genetic history, diversity and threats remain understudied. We re-sequenced 31 whole genomes (between 11X - 32X) from all known elephant landscapes in India and identified five management/conservation units corresponding to elephants in northern India, central India and three in southern India. The genetic data reveal signatures of serial colonisation, and a dilution of diversity from north to south of India. The northern populations diverged from other populations more than 70,000 years ago, and have higher genetic diversity, with low inbreeding/high effective size (Pi = 0.0016{+/-}0.0001; FROH> 1MB= 0.09{+/-}0.03). Two of three populations in southern India have low diversity and are inbred with much lower effective sizes than current populations sizes (Pi = 0.0014{+/-}0.00009 and 0.0015{+/-}0.0001; FROH> 1MB= 0.25{+/-}0.09 and 0.17{+/-}0.02). Additionally, future generations are expected to be more inbred since pairs of extant elephants have large tracts of the genome that are already identical. Analyses of genetic load reveals purging of potentially high-effect deleterious alleles in the southern populations and potential dilution of all deleterious alleles from north to south in India. However, southern Indian elephants are highly homozygous for all the deleterious alleles that persist, despite dilution and purging. High homozygosity of deleterious alleles, coupled with low neutral genetic diversity make them high priority for conservation and management attention. Most surprisingly, our study suggests that patterns of genetic diversity and genetic load can correspond to geographic signatures of serial founding events even in large mobile endangered species.",

    "abstract": "Cells are fundamental units of life. Recent technical advances have revolutionized our ability to quantify the state and identity of individual cells, and intercellular regulatory programs. However, these static measurements alone are limited in their ability to predict the complex collective behaviors that emerge from populations of many interacting cells over time. Mathematical models have a proven record of successfully predicting the behaviors of dynamic biological systems, e.g., therapeutic responses in cancer. Simulations from these models enable in silico visualization, examination, and refinement of biological models and can be used to generate new hypotheses about cells and their collective behavior. Agent-based modeling is particularly well-suited to studying communities of interacting cells, as it is intuitive to map a single cell to a single agent. Thus, we have developed a conceptual framing (with a reference implementation in the widely-used PhysiCell agent-based modeling framework) that can be initialized directly from single cell and spatial transcriptomic data, and that can be easily populated with interactive rules. Because the expert mathematical and computational knowledge required to build agent-based models has limited their widespread adoption in the biomedical research community, we engineered this framework to specify complex cellular responses to signals (or stimuli) using a single line of human-readable text. This plain language text encodes cellular phenotypes and regulatory mechanisms from high throughput data and published literature, using a novel concept of hypothesis grammar. We motivate and fully describe this grammar and its philosophy, and then present a series of five example reference models of tumor growth and response to immunotherapy. Biologically, these examples demonstrate how mathematical models can predict from single cell and spatial transcriptomic data the cellular phenotypes responsible for tumor cell invasion and the simulation of immunotherapy treatment to overcome tumor cell growth. Computationally, these examples are designed to demonstrate how this conceptual framing and software implementation empower interdisciplinary teams to build an agent-based model of their experimental system, leveraging prior biological knowledge alone or in combination with information from spatial multiomics technologies. Altogether, this approach provides an interface to bridge biological, clinical, and systems biology researchers for mathematical modeling of biological systems at scale, allowing the community to extrapolate from single-cell characterization to emergent multicellular behavior.",

Of these, only Dyn1xA is enriched at endocytic zones and accelerates vesicle fission during ultrafast endocytosis. Here, we report that the long tail variant, Dyn1xA, achieves this localization by preferentially binding to Endophilin A through a newly defined Class II binding site overlapping with its extension, at a site spanning the splice boundary. Endophilin binds this site at higher affinity than the previously reported site, and this affinity is determined by amino acids outside the binding sites acting as long distance elements within the xA tail. Their interaction is regulated by the phosphorylation state of two serine residues specific to the xA variant. Dyn1xA and Endophilin colocalize in patches near the active zone of synapses. Mutations selectively disrupting Endophilin binding to the long extension cause Dyn1xA mislocalization along axons. In these mutants, endocytic pits are stalled on the plasma membrane during ultrafast endocytosis. These data suggest that the specificity for ultrafast endocytosis is defined by the phospho-regulated interaction of Endophilin A through a newly identified site of Dyn1xAs long tail.",

    "abstract": "PurposeAtrophy of the hippocampus is an early biomarker of Alzheimers disease (AD) and a main contributor to the patients mnemonic degeneration. While previous research has mostly focused on how hippocampal atrophy impaired long-term memory performance, its relation to short-term memory impairment, which was also found among patients with AD, remains largely uninvestigated. Filling this gap, the current study examined how atrophy in the hippocampus and its subfields may have influenced visual short-term memory (VSTM) in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a common precursor of AD.\n\nMethodsFifty-eight aMCI patients and 69 healthy controls (HC) matched in age were included in the current study. VSTM was assessed using an adapted change detection task with a memory load of 2 or 4 items. Hippocampal subfields were automatically segmented in T1-weighted image using FreeSurfer and were manually inspected for errors. Volumes of the subfields were extracted and compared between aMCI and HC subjects using ANCOVA with age, gender and education as covariates. Furthermore, we also examined the partial correlation between VSTM performances and hippocampal subfield volumes with age, gender and education as covariates.\n\nResultsCompared to HC subjects, aMCI subjects had lower response accuracy (ACC) and lower memory capacity under both load conditions and had longer reaction time (RT) in the 2-load condition. Left hippocampus volume was significantly smaller in aMCI and was positively correlated with ACC and capacity in HC but not in aMCI. Among the hippocampal subfields, left hippocampal tail, left molecular layer, left granule cell molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (GC-ML-DG), left CA4, right hippocampal fissure, bilateral subiculum, bilateral presubiculum, bilateral fimbria, were significantly smaller in aMCI compared to HC. Volumes of the left subiculum, left molecular layer, left GC-ML-DG and left CA4 were positively correlated with ACC and capacity in HC but not in aMCI. Bilateral fimbria volume was negatively correlated with RT under the 2-load condition in HC but not in aMCI.\n\nConclusionThe results of this study suggested that hippocampal atrophy, especially in subfields related to information input and output (e.g. molecular layer, GC-ML-DG, subiculum), may have contributed to VSTM impairment in aMCI by disrupting hippocampal-cortical communications. This finding adds to increasing evidence of hippocampal engagement in short-term memory processes and points to VSTM impairment as a potential neuropsychological indicator for MCI and AD.",

However, frog species remain underrepresented, with up to 90% of frog genera having no genomic or transcriptomic data.

The southern stuttering frog is ground-dwelling, inhabiting naturally vegetated riverbanks in south-eastern Australia.

Using this assembly, we identified the mitochondrial genome, and assembled six tissue-specific transcriptomes. We also bioinformatically characterised novel sequences of two families of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the southern stuttering frog, the cathelicidins and {beta}-defensins. While traditional peptidomic approaches to peptide discovery have typically identified one or two AMPs in a frog species from skin secretions, our bioinformatic approach discovered 12 cathelicidins and two {beta}-defensins that were expressed in a range of tissues. We investigated the novelty of the peptides and found diverse predicted activities. Our bioinformatic approach highlights the benefits of multi-omics resources in peptide discovery and contributes valuable genomic resources in an under-represented taxon.",

    "abstract": "Since the release of AlphaFold, large efforts have been undertaken to improve its predictions and integrate it in already existing pipelines for the determination of protein structures. Though a number of functionalities have been introduced, and results at the latest CASP edition showed a marked improvement in the prediction of multimers, AlphaFold's capability of predicting large protein complexes is still limited, and integration with experimental data is not straightforward. In this study, we introduce AF_unmasked: a version of AlphaFold able to better take advantage of information from experimental structures to build high-quality protein assemblies, including very large protein complexes. We test AF_unmasked on difficult targets from the latest CASP edition as well as on large protein cryo-EM targets and show that this new approach enables generation of near-perfect structures even when little to no evolutionary information is available or when imperfect experimental structures are used as a starting point. We also show how incomplete structures can be filled in by AF_unmasked, a procedure called \"structural inpainting\", and how this can give insights into protein dynamics. In summary, AF_unmasked represents an easy-to-use method with much improved capacity to efficiently integrate experiments and predictions to solve large protein complexes, without any need for computationally demanding re-training.

Here, we demonstrate that the lipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) expressed on germinal center (GC) B cells is essential for the production of high-affinity antibodies. Mechanistically, Gb3 binds and disengages CD19 from its chaperone CD81 for subsequent translocation to the B cell receptor (BCR) complex to trigger signaling. Abundance of Gb3 amplifies the PI3-kinase/Akt/Foxo1 pathway to drive affinity maturation. Moreover, this lipid regulates MHC-II expression to increase diversity of T follicular helper (Tfh) and GC B cells reactive with subdominant epitopes. In influenza infection, Gb3 promotes broadly reactive antibody responses and cross-protection. Thus, we show that Gb3 determines affinity as well as breadth in B cell immunity and propose this lipid as novel vaccine adjuvant against viral infection.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryGb3 abundance on GC B cells selects antibodies with high affinity and broad epitope reactivities, which are cross-protective against heterologous influenza infection.",

    "abstract": "DNA origami nanodevices achieve programmable structure and tunable mechanical and dynamic properties by leveraging the sequence specific interactions of nucleic acids. Previous advances have also established DNA origami as a useful building block to make well-defined micron-scale structures through hierarchical self-assembly, but these efforts have largely leveraged the structural features of DNA origami. The tunable dynamic and mechanical properties also provide an opportunity to make assemblies with adaptive structure and properties. Here we report the integration of DNA origami hinge nanodevices and coiled-coil peptides into hybrid reconfigurable assemblies. With the same dynamic device and peptide interaction, we make multiple higher order assemblies by organizing clusters of peptides (i.e. patches) or arranging single peptides (i.e. patterns) on the surfaces of DNA origami to control the relative orientation of devices. We use coiled-coil interactions to construct circular and linear assemblies whose structure and mechanical properties can be modulated with DNA-based actuation. Actuation of linear assemblies leads to micron scale motions and [~]2.5-10-fold increase in bending stiffness. Our results provide a foundation for stimulus responsive hybrid assemblies that can adapt their structure and properties in response to nucleic acid, peptide, protein, or other triggers.",

    "abstract": "The HIV-1 assembly process begins with a newly synthesized Gag polyprotein being targeted to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of the infected cells to form immature viral particles. Gag-membrane interactions are mediated through the myristoylated(Myr) N-terminal matrix (MA) domain of Gag which eventually multimerize on the membrane to form trimers and higher-order oligomers. The study of the structure and dynamics of peripheral membrane proteins like MA has been challenging for both experimental and computational studies due to the complex dynamics of protein-membrane interactions. Although the roles of anionic phospholipids (PIP2, PS) and the Myr group in the membrane targeting and stable membrane binding of MA are now well-established, the cooperative interactions between MA monomers and MA-membrane still remain elusive. Our present study focuses on the membrane binding dynamics of a higher-order oligomeric structure of MA protein (a dimer of trimers), which has not been explored before. Employing time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA) to our microsecond-long trajectories, we investigate conformational changes of the matrix protein induced by membrane binding. Interestingly, the Myr switch of a MA monomer correlates with the conformational switch of adjacent monomers in the same trimer. Together, our findings suggest that MA trimerization facilitates Myr insertion, but MA trimer-trimer interactions in the lattice of immature HIV-1 particles can hinder the same. Additionally, local lipid density patterns of different lipid species provide a signature of the initial stage of lipid-domain formation upon membrane binding of the protein complex.\n\nTOC\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=104 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/559012v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c4380corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3bbc05org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b50f42org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fccd7f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Understanding the signals that regulate AHN has implications for brain function and therapy.

Conditional deletion of Cav-1 in adult neural progenitor cells (nestin +) led to increased neurogenesis and enhanced performance of mice in contextual discrimination. Proteomic analysis revealed that Cav-1 plays a role in mitochondrial pathways in neural progenitor cells. Importantly, Cav-1 was localized to the mitochondria in neural progenitor cells and modulated mitochondrial fission-fusion, a critical process in neurogenesis. These results suggest that Cav-1 is a novel regulator of AHN and underscore the impact of AHN on cognition.",

We identified immature precursors to the Adaptive NK cells that are equally present in both CMV+ and CMV-individuals, resolved an Adaptive transcriptional state distinct from most mature NK cells and sharing a common gene program with the immature CD56bright population, and demonstrated retention of proliferative capacity and acquisition of superior IFN{gamma} production in the Adaptive population.

We find that the transcription factor NFAT5 directly senses solution ionic strength using a C-terminal intrinsically disordered region. Both in intact cells and in a purified system, NFAT5 forms dynamic, reversible biomolecular condensates in response to increasing ionic strength. This self-associative property, conserved from insects to mammals, allows NFAT5 to accumulate in the nucleus and activate genes that restore cellular ion content. Mutations that reduce condensation or those that promote aggregation both reduce NFAT5 activity, highlighting the importance of optimally tuned associative interactions. Remarkably, human NFAT5 alone is sufficient to reconstitute a mammalian transcriptional response to ionic or hypertonic stress in yeast. Thus NFAT5 is both the sensor and effector of a cell-autonomous ionic stress response pathway in animal cells.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe placenta is vital for fetal development and its contributions to various developmental issues, such as pregnancy complications, fetal growth restriction, and maternal exposure, have been extensively studied in mice. Contrary to popular belief, the placenta forms mainly from fetal tissue; therefore, it has the same biological sex as the fetus it supports. However, while placental function is linked to increased risks of pregnancy complications and neurodevelopmental diseases in male offspring in particular, the sex-specific epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) and transcriptomic features of the late-gestation mouse placenta remain largely unknown.\n\nMethodsWe collected male and female mouse placentas at late gestation (E18.5, n = 3/sex) and performed next-generation sequencing to identify genome-wide sex-specific differences in transcription and DNA methylation.\n\nResultsOur sex-specific analysis revealed 358 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) on autosomes, which were associated with signaling pathways involved in transmembrane transport and the responses to viruses and external stimuli. X chromosome DEGs (n = 39) were associated with different pathways, including those regulating chromatin modification and small GTPase-mediated signal transduction. Sex-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were more common on the X chromosomes (n = 3756) than on autosomes (n = 1705). Interestingly, while most X chromosome DMRs had higher DNA methylation levels in female placentas and tended to be included in CpG dinucleotide-rich regions, 73% of autosomal DMRs had higher methylation levels in male placentas and were distant from CpG-rich regions. Several sex-specific DEGs were correlated with sex-specific DMRs. A subset of the sex-specific DMRs present in late-stage placentas were already established in mid-gestation (E10.5) placentas, while others were acquired later in placental development.\n\nConclusionOur study provides comprehensive lists of sex-specific DEGs and DMRs that collectively cause profound differences in the DNA methylation and gene expression profiles of late-gestation mouse placentas. Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating sex-specific analyses into epigenetic and transcription studies to enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of their conclusions and help address the significant knowledge gap regarding how sex differences influence placental function.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIn the mouse placenta, sex-specific gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, enriched in various metabolic and developmental pathways, are observed for both X-linked and autosomal genes from mid-gestation onward.\nC_LIO_LIRegions with different DNA methylation are commonly found in CpG-rich areas on the X chromosomes and in CpG-poor regions on autosomes.\nC_LIO_LIA subset of the sex-specific DMRs observed in late-stage placentas were already established in mid-gestation placentas, whereas others were acquired during the later stages of placental development.\nC_LIO_LISeveral sex-specific DNA methylation differences could be correlated with sex-specific differences in gene expression.\nC_LIO_LIThe results highlight the importance of including sex-based analyses in epigenetic and transcriptional studies of the mouse placenta.\nC_LI\n\nPlain English summaryThe placenta is a crucial organ for a healthy pregnancy and proper fetal development, and its functions are often studied in mice. The placenta stems from the developing embryo, and therefore shares its sex. Male fetuses have higher risks of pregnancy complications and neurodevelopmental disorders, and these risks are linked to placenta functions. However, how the placentas sex influences the proteins it contains--and therefore, how it helps the fetus develop--remains largely unknown. We used cutting-edge techniques to systematically examine late-pregnancy mouse placentas, cataloging the genes being expressed (i.e., sections of DNA used to make proteins) and the patterns of a specific DNA mark (called methylation) that controls gene expression. We identified several genes with important placental functions, such as protecting the fetus from viruses and responding to environmental changes, whose expression levels were sex-specific. We also observed differences in DNA methylation between male and female placentas. Most DNA methylation differences were on the X-chromosomes associated with sex, and the majority had higher methylation levels in female placentas. Conversely, on other chromosomes, most DNA methylation differences were increased in male placentas. As methylation affects gene expression, we found links between the changes. Additionally, we found that some sex-specific differences in the placenta were already present earlier in pregnancy. Our findings provide important insights into the molecular differences between male and female mouse placentas during late pregnancy. Including sex-specific analyses in placenta studies will improve our understanding of how the placenta ensures the healthy development of male and female fetuses.",

    "abstract": "The fitness cost of an antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) can differ across host strains creating refuges that allow maintenance of an ARG in the absence of direct selection for its resistance phenotype. Despite the importance of such ARG-host interactions for predicting ARG dynamics, the basis of ARG fitness costs and their variability between hosts are not well understood. We determined the genetic basis of a host-dependent cost of a {beta}-lactamase, blaTEM-116*, that conferred a significant cost in one Escherichia coli strain but was close to neutral in 11 other Escherichia spp. strains. Selection of a blaTEM-116* encoding plasmid in the strain in which it initially had a high cost resulted in rapid and parallel compensation to that cost through mutations in a P1 phage gene, relAP1. When the wildtype relAP1 gene was added to a strain in which it was not present and in which blaTEM-116* was neutral, it caused the ARG to become costly. Thus, relAP1 is both necessary and sufficient to explain blaTEM-116* costs in at least some host backgrounds. To our knowledge, these findings represent the first demonstrated case of the cost of an ARG being influenced by a genetic interaction with a phage gene. The interaction between a phage gene and a plasmid-borne ARG highlights the complexity of selective forces determining the maintenance and spread of ARGs, and, by extension, encoding phage and plasmids, in natural bacterial communities.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining the metabolic homeostasis of fatty acids is crucial for human health. Excess fatty acids are stored in lipid droplets (LDs), the primary energy reservoir that helps regulate fat and lipid homeostasis in nearly all cell types. Seipin (BSCL2), a conserved endoplasmic reticulum protein, plays a critical role in LD biogenesis and regulating LD morphology. Pathogenic variants of seipin are associated with multiple human genetic diseases, including Berardinelli-Seip Congenital Generalized Lipodystrophy Type 2 (BSCL2). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which dysfunctional seipin leads to these diseases remain unclear. To model BSCL2 disease, we generated an orthologous BSCL2 pathogenic variant seip-1(A185P) using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in Caenorhabditis elegans. This variant led to severe developmental and cellular defects, including embryonic lethality, impaired eggshell formation, and abnormally enlarged LDs. We set out to identify genetic determinants that could suppress these defective phenotypes in the seip-1(A185P) mutant background. To this end, we conducted an unbiased chemical mutagenesis screen to identify genetic suppressors that restore embryonic viability in the seip-1(A185P) mutant background. A total of five suppressor lines were isolated and recovered from the screen. The defective phenotypes of seip-1(A185P), including embryonic lethality and impaired eggshell formation, were significantly suppressed in each suppressor line. Two of the five suppressor lines also alleviated the enlarged LDs in the oocytes. We then mapped a suppressor candidate gene, R05D3.2 (renamed as lmbr-1), which is an ortholog of human LMBR1 (limb development membrane protein 1). The CRISPR/Cas9 edited lmbr-1 suppressor alleles, lmbr-1(Ser647Phe) and lmbr-1(Pro314Leu), both significantly suppressed embryonic lethality and defective eggshell formation in the seip-1(A185P) background. The newly identified suppressor lines offer valuable insights into potential genetic interactors and pathways that may regulate seipin in the lipodystrophy model.",

However, when applied to human cells, it remains challenging to identify and quantify cell type-specific active enhancers in the genome-wide scale with high-resolution, due to the large size of human genome. In this study, we selected the H3K4me1 associated dinucleosome with the linker DNA sequences as candidate enhancer sequences in two different human cell lines and performed ChIP-STARR-seq to quantify the cell type-specific enhancer activities with high-resolution in a genome-wide scale. Furthermore, we investigated how the activity landscape of enhancer repository would change when transferred from native cells (cis activity) to another cell lines (trans activity). Using ChIP-STARR-seq of the candidate enhancers in native cells and another type of cells, we obtained enhancers cis activity maps and trans activity maps in two different cell lines. The cis and trans activity maps enabled us to identify cell type-specific active enhancers, with enrichment of motifs of differentially expressed TFs. Comparisons between the cis and trans activity maps revealed general consistent regulatory property with different levels of activity in the two cell types, suggesting the sequence intrinsic regulatory properties keep similar in different type of cells.

The role LINC plays in mechanotransduction pathways in bone progenitor cells has been well studied; however, the mechanisms by which LINC complexes govern in vivo bone formation remain less clear. To bridge this knowledge gap, we established a murine model disrupting LINC using transgenic Prx-Cre mice and floxed Tg(CAG-LacZ/EGFP-KASH2) mice. Prx-Cre mice express the Cre recombinase enzyme controlled by the paired-related homeobox gene-1 promoter, a pivotal regulator of skeletal development. Tg(CAG-LacZ/EGFP-KASH2) mice carry a lox-stop-lox flanked LacZ gene allowing for the overexpression of an EGFP-KASH2 fusion protein via cre recombinase mediated deletion of the LacZ cassette. This disrupts endogenous Nesprin-Sun binding in a dominant negative manner disconnecting nesprin from the nuclear envelope. By combining these lines, we generated a Prrx1(+) cell-specific LINC disruption model to study its impact on the developing skeleton and subsequently exercise-induced bone accrual. The findings presented here indicate Prx-driven LINC disruption (PDLD) cells exhibit no change in osteogenic and adipogenic potential compared to controls in vitro nor are there bone quality changes when compared to in sedentary animals at 8 weeks. Although PDLD animals displayed increased voluntary running activity, a 6-week exercise intervention did not significantly alter bone microarchitecture or mechanical properties.",

    "abstract": "Seed colors and color patterns are critical for the survival of wild plants and the consumer appeal of crops. In common bean, a major global staple, these patterns are also critical for determining market classes, yet the genetic and environmental control of many pigmentation patterns remains unresolved. In this study, we genetically mapped variation for three important seed pattern loci, T, Bip, and phbw, which co-segregated completely with PvTTG1, PvMYC1, and PvTT8, respectively. Proteins encoded by these genes are predicted to work together in MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) complexes, propagating flavonoid biosynthesis across the seed coat. Whole-genome sequencing of 37 diverse accessions identified putative mutations in each gene, including seven unique parallel mutations in T (PvTTG1) and a non-synonymous SNP in a conserved residue in bipana (PvMYC1). A 612 bp intron deletion in phbw (PvTT8) eliminated motifs conserved since the origins of the Papilionoidea and corresponded to a 20-fold reduction in transcript abundance. Mutations in MBW candidate genes for Z (PvTT2) and Sellatus (WDR) were also identified. In multi-location field trials with seven varieties with partial seed coat patterning, pigmented seed coat area was highly unstable and correlated with temperature, with up to 11-fold differences in pigmented area between the warmest and the coolest environments. In controlled growth chamber conditions, an increase of 4 {degrees}C was sufficient to cause pigmentation on an additional 21% of the seed coat area. Our results shed light on the fundamental activation of flavonoid biosynthesis in common bean and will be instrumental for maximizing consumer appeal in this nutritious staple crop.\n\nSummary- Seed colors and patterns are critical for the survival of wild plants, and are important in differentiating crop market classes, but the genetic control of these in the staple crop common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is largely unknown.\n\n- The genetic, transcriptional, and environmental basis of common bean seed color patterning was explored through QTL mapping, whole-genome sequencing, RT-qPCR, and automated pigmentation quantification of seed grown in multi-location field trials and growth chamber environments.\n\n- MYB-bHLH-WD40 complex-forming genes PvTTG1, PvMYC1, and PvTT8 co-segregated completely with the color patterning genes T, Bip, and phbw. Mutations were identified in each gene, including seven unique parallel mutations in T (PvTTG1), a non-synonymous SNP in a conserved residue in bipana (PvMYC1), and an intron deletion in phbw (PvTT8) eliminating highly conserved motifs and corresponding to 20-fold lower PvTT8 transcript abundance.

    "abstract": "BackgroundPlant-parasitic nematodes compromise the agriculture of a wide variety of the most common crops worldwide. Obtaining information on the fundamental biology of these organisms and how they infect the plant has been restricted by the ability to visualize intact nematodes using small molecule stains, antibodies, or in situ hybridization. Consequently, there is limited information available about the internal composition of the nematodes or the biology of the effector molecules they use to reprogram their host plant.\n\nResultsWe present the Sperling prep -a whole mount method for nematode preparation that enables staining with small molecules, antibodies, or in situ hybridization chain reaction. This method does not require specialized apparatus and utilizes typical laboratory equipment and materials. By dissociating the strong cuticle and interior muscle layers, we enabled entry of the small molecule stains into the tissue. After permeabilization, small molecule stains can be used to visualize the nuclei with the DNA stain DAPI and the internal structures of the digestive tract and longitudinal musculature with the filamentous actin stain phalloidin. The permeabilization even allows entry of larger antibodies, albeit with lower efficiency. Finally, this method works exceptionally well with in situ HCR. Using this method, we have visualized effector transcripts specific to the dorsal gland and the subventral grand of the sugar beet cyst nematode, Heterodera schachtii, multiplexed in the same nematode.\n\nConclusionWe were able to visualize the internal structures of the nematode as well as key effector transcripts that are used during plant infection and parasitism. Therefore, this method provides an important toolkit for studying the biology of plant-parasitic nematodes.",

    "abstract": "Soybean is a globally important industrial, food, and cash crop. Despite its importance in present and future economies, its production is severely hampered by bruchids (Callosobruchus chinensis), a destructive storage insect pest, causing considerable yield losses. Therefore, the identification of genomic regions and candidate genes associated with bruchid resistance in soybean is crucial as it helps breeders develop new soybean varieties with improved resistance and quality. In this study, 6 multi-locus methods of the mrMLM model for genome-wide association study were used to dissect the genetic architecture of bruchid resistance using 5 traits: percentage adult bruchid emergence (PBE), percentage weight loss (PWL), growth index (GI), median development period (MDP), and Dobie susceptibility index (DSI) on 100 diverse soybean genotypes, genotyped with 14,469 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Using the best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs), 13 quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) were identified by the mrMLM model, 3 of which, rs16_14976250, rs1_22916615, and rs16_14975721, were associated with more than 1 bruchid resistance trait. As a result, the identified QTNs linked with resistance traits can be employed in marker-assisted breeding for the accurate and rapid screening of soybean genotypes for resistance to bruchids. Moreover, a gene search on the Phytozome soybean reference genome identified 27 potential candidate genes located within a window of 478.45 kb upstream and downstream of the most reliable QTNs. These candidate genes exhibit molecular and biological functionalities associated with various soybean resistance mechanisms and, therefore, could be incorporated into the farmers preferred soybean varieties that are susceptible to bruchids.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptomic data from breast-cancer patients are widely available in public repositories. However, before a researcher can perform statistical inferences or make biological interpretations from such data, they must find relevant datasets, download the data, and perform quality checks. In many cases, it is also useful to normalize and standardize the data for consistency and to use updated genome annotations. Additionally, researchers need to parse and interpret metadata: clinical and demographic characteristics of patients. Each of these steps requires computational and/or biomedical expertise, thus imposing a barrier to reuse for many researchers. We have identified and curated 102 publicly available, breast-cancer datasets representing 17,151 patients. We created a reproducible, computational pipeline to download the data, perform quality checks, renormalize the raw gene-expression measurements (when available), assign gene identifiers from multiple databases, and annotate the metadata against the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus, thus making it easier to infer semantic meaning and compare insights across datasets. We have made the curated data and pipeline freely available for other researchers to use. Having these resources in one place promises to accelerate breast-cancer research, enabling researchers to address diverse types of questions, using data from a variety of patient populations and study contexts.",

    "abstract": "Marsupials are born with structurally immature lungs when compared to eutherian mammals. The Gray short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica) is born at the late canalicular stage of lung development. Despite the high degree of immaturity, the lung is functioning as respiratory organ, however supported by the skin for gas exchange during the first postnatal days. Consequently, the majority of lung development takes place in ventilated functioning state during the postnatal period.\n\nX-ray computed tomography ({micro}CT) was used to three-dimensionally reconstruct the terminal airspaces in order to reveal the timeline of lung morphogenesis. In addition, lung and air space volume as well as surface area were determined to assess the functional relevance of the structural changes in the developing lung. The development of the terminal air spaces was examined in 35 animals from embryonic day 13, during the postnatal period (neonate to 57 days) and in adults. At birth, the lung of M. domestica consists of few large terminal air spaces, which are poorly subdivided and open directly from short lobar bronchioles. During the first postnatal week the number of smaller terminal air spaces increases and numerous septal ridges indicate a process of subdivision, attaining the saccular stage by 7 days. The 3 D reconstructions of the terminal air spaces demonstrated massive increases in air sac number and architectural complexity during the postnatal period. Between 28 and 35 days alveolarization started. Respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and a typical acinus developed. With alveolarization the volume of the air spaces and the surface area for gas exchange increased markedly. The structural transformation from large terminal sacs to the final alveolar lung in the Gray short-tailed opossum follows similar patterns as described in other marsupial and placental mammals. The processes involved in sacculation and alveolarization during lung development seem to be highly conservative within mammalian evolution.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic scores (PGS) are quantitative metrics for predicting phenotypic values, such as human height or disease status. Some PGS methods require only summary statistics of a relevant genome-wide association study (GWAS) for their score. One such method is Lassosum, which inherits the model selection advantages of Lasso to select a meaningful subset of the GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms as predictors from their association statistics. However, even efficient scores like Lassosum, when derived from European-based GWAS, are poor predictors of phenotype for subjects of non-European ancestry; that is, they have limited portability to other ancestries. To increase the portability of Lassosum, when GWAS information and estimates of linkage disequilibrium are available for both ancestries, we propose Joint-Lassosum. In the simulation settings we explore, Joint-Lassosum provides more accurate PGS compared with other methods, especially when measured in terms of fairness. Like all PGS methods, Joint-Lassosum requires selection of predictors, which are determined by data-driven tuning parameters. We describe a new approach to selecting tuning parameters and note its relevance for model selection for any PGS. We also draw connections to the literature on algorithmic fairness and discuss how Joint-Lassosum can help mitigate fairness-related harms that might result from the use of PGS scores in clinical settings. While no PGS method is likely to be universally portable, due to the diversity of human populations and unequal information content of GWAS for different ancestries, Joint-Lassosum is an effective approach for enhancing portability and reducing predictive bias.",

By analyzing 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified and confirmed significant correlations between CpG methylation and gene expression (emQTL) in cis and trans, both across and within cancer types. Bipartite network analysis of the emQTL revealed groups of CpGs and genes related to important biological processes involved in carcinogenesis; specifically, we identified three types of emQTL networks associated with alterations linked to the regulation of proliferation, metabolism, and hormone-signaling. These bipartite communities were characterized by loss of enhancer methylation in transcription factor binding regions (TFBRs) located in enhancers. The underlying CpGs were topologically linked to upregulated genes through chromatin loops. Loss of enhancer methylation and target genes were exemplified in pancreatic cancer. Penalized Cox regression analysis showed a significant prognostic impact of the pan-cancer emQTL. Taken together, our integrative pan-cancer analysis reveals a common architecture of aberrant DNA demethylation that illustrates a convergence of pathological regulatory mechanisms across cancer types.",

We observe that genes associated with key biological pathways including cell proliferation, immune response and drug metabolism are differentially regulated between males and females in both healthy lung tissue, as well as in tumor, and that these regulatory differences are further perturbed by tobacco smoking. We also uncovered significant sex bias in transcription factor targeting patterns of clinically actionable oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, including AKT2 and KRAS. Using differentially regulated genes between healthy and tumor samples in conjunction with a drug repurposing tool, we identified several small-molecule drugs that might have sex-biased efficacy as cancer therapeutics and further validated this observation using an independent cell line database.

    "abstract": "Over the last decade there has been a surge in vaping device usage, especially among adolescents, raising concerns for potentially related lung damage. Notoriously, there have been many e-cigarette or vaping-related lung injury (EVALI) cases resulting in hospitalisations and deaths. Although the vaping component vitamin E acetate has been linked to a large proportion of EVALI cases resulting in its widespread banning, one fifth of the cases remain unexplained. Furthermore, the overall long-term impact of vaping on respiratory health is poorly understood. A likely driver behind EVALI is pulmonary surfactant disruption, as it is the first point of contact for any inhaled toxicant in the alveoli, and abnormalities of its function are linked to some symptoms presented in EVALI cases. Aberrant biophysical function of the surfactant results in alveolar surface tension increase, causing alveolar collapse. Vaping chemicals with the potential to disrupt surfactant function must be hydrophobic molecules able to interact with surfactant components at the alveolar air-liquid interface. Recent findings have recorded the synthesis of highly hydrophobic acetal by-products of the base vaping chemical propylene glycol and common flavouring aldehydes, including the cherry flavouring benzaldehyde, not identified in preliminary e-liquid safety tests. This study provides evidence that benzaldehyde and its by-product, benzaldehyde propylene glycol acetal, have the potential to significantly disrupt surfactant biophysical function via interactions with surfactant proteins SP-B and/or SP-C, which may provide stable interactions within the surfactant film by forming associations with the sublayer of surfactant three-dimensional structure present at high lateral compression, i.e., expiration breathing. Data also suggest considerable vaping chemical loss to the experimental subphase, indicating potential further implications to the alveolar epithelial layer beneath.",

Here, by inducing heterogeneous aneuploidy in non-transformed human colon organoids (colonoids), we investigate how the effects of aneuploidy on cell growth and differentiation may promote malignant transformation. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that the gene expression signature across over 100 unique aneuploid karyotypes is enriched with p53 responsive genes. The primary driver of p53 activation is karyotype complexity. Complex aneuploid cells with multiple unbalanced chromosomes activate p53 and undergo G1 cell-cycle arrest, independent of DNA damage and without evidence of senescence. By contrast, simple aneuploid cells with 1-3 chromosomes gained or lost continue to proliferate, demonstrated by single cell tracking in colonoids. Notably, simple aneuploid cells exhibit impaired differentiation when niche factors are withdrawn. These findings suggest that while complex aneuploid cells are eliminated from the normal epithelium due to p53 activation, simple aneuploid cells can escape this checkpoint and may contribute to niche factor-independent growth of cancer-initiating cells.",

Hand2 promotes cardiac progenitor differentiation and epithelial maturation, while repressing other tissue types. The mechanisms underlying the promotion of cardiac fates are far better understood than those underlying the repression of alternative fates. Here, we assess Hand2-dependent changes in gene expression and chromatin remodeling in cardiac progenitors of zebrafish embryos. Cell-type specific transcriptome analysis shows a dual function for Hand2 in activation of cardiac differentiation genes and repression of pronephric pathways. We identify functional cis-regulatory elements whose chromatin accessibility are increased in hand2 mutant cells. These regulatory elements associate with non-cardiac gene expression, and drive reporter gene expression in tissues associated with Hand2-repressed genes. We find that functional Hand2 is sufficient to reduce non-cardiac reporter expression in cardiac lineages. Taken together, our data support a model of Hand2-dependent coordination of transcriptional programs, not only through transcriptional activation of cardiac and epithelial maturation genes, but also through repressive chromatin remodeling at the DNA regulatory elements of non-cardiac genes.",

    "abstract": "The neurovascular unit (NVU) is a complex structure comprising neurons, glia, and pericytes that interact with specialized endothelial cells to maintain cerebral homeostasis and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Alterations to NVU formation and function can lead to serious forms of cerebrovascular disease, including cerebral small vessel diseases (CSVDs), a range of pathological changes of cerebral capillaries within the white matter contributing to BBB dysfunction and demyelination.\n\nDespite the growing recognition of the pivotal roles played by neuro-vascular and glia-vascular interfaces in NVU formation and functioning, CSVD research has mainly focused on characterizing pericyte and EC dysfunction, leaving our understanding of the contribution of non-vascular cells of the brain parenchyma limited.\n\nHere, we use a novel zebrafish mutant to delve into the intricate interplay among NVU components and demonstrate how the compromised specification of a progenitor cell population sets off a cascade of events, ultimately leading to severe cerebrovascular abnormalities. The mutation affects Scavenger Receptor B2 (scarb2)/Lysosomal Membrane Protein 2 (limp2), a highly conserved protein residing in the membrane of late endosomes and lysosomes. We find Scarb2 to be predominantly expressed in Radial Glia Cells (RGCs), a multipotent cell giving rise to neurons and glia in both zebrafish and mammals. Through live imaging and genetic manipulations, we identify impaired Notch3 signaling in RGCs and their glial progeny as the primary consequence of Scarb2a depletion and show that this disruption causes excessive neurogenesis at the expense of glial cell differentiation. We further pinpoint compromised acidification of the endolysosomal compartment in mutant cells as the underlying cause of disrupted Notch3 processing, linking for the first time Notch3 defects in non-vascular cells of the brain parenchyma to CSVD phenotypes.\n\nGiven the evolutionary conservation of SCARB2 expression and the remarkable recapitulation of CSVD phenotypes, scarb2 mutants provide a promising framework for investigating the mechanisms governing Notch3 processing in non-vascular cells and their involvement in the onset of CSVD.",

    "abstract": "We report a role for activity in the development of the primary sensory neurons that detect touch. Genetic deletion of Piezo2, the principal mechanosensitive ion channel in somatosensory neurons, caused profound changes in the formation of mechanosensory end organ structures and altered somatosensory neuron central targeting. Single cell RNA sequencing of Piezo2 conditional mutants revealed changes in gene expression in the sensory neurons activated by light mechanical forces, whereas other neuronal classes were less affected. To further test the role of activity in mechanosensory end organ development, we genetically deleted the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6 (Scn8a) in somatosensory neurons throughout development and found that Scn8a mutants also have disrupted somatosensory neuron morphologies and altered electrophysiological responses to mechanical stimuli. Together, these findings indicate that mechanically evoked neuronal activity acts early in life to shape the maturation of the mechanosensory end organs that underlie our sense of gentle touch.",

Besides complications related to pulmonary hypoplasia, 1 in 4 survivors develop neurodevelopmental impairment, whose etiology remains unclear. Using a fetal rat model of CDH, we demonstrated that the compression exerted by herniated organs on the mediastinal structures results in decreased brain perfusion on ultrafast ultrasound, cerebral hypoxia with compensatory angiogenesis, mature neuron and oligodendrocyte loss, and activated microglia. In CDH fetuses, apoptosis was prominent in the subventricular and subgranular zones, areas that are key for neurogenesis. We validated these findings in the autopsy samples of four human fetuses with CDH compared to age- and sex-matched controls.

    "abstract": "IntroductionPregnancy-related disorders such as preeclampsia are associated with syncytiotrophoblast (STB) stress and monocyte dysregulation. It remains unclear whether this stress derives from prolonged placental hypoxia or a hypoxia-reperfusion-type injury. Thus, this study investigated how these two models of STB stress impact trophoblast-monocyte interactions.\n\nMethodCobalt chloride chemically induced hypoxia in BeWo b30 cells. A transwell coculture system was used to examine trophoblast-monocyte signaling. qPCR quantified gene expression changes following coculture. Monocyte phagocytosis of E. Coli or adhesion to placental cells was determined via flow cytometry. Monocyte migration to placental signals was quantified using a cell counter.\n\nResultsCobalt chloride induced a hypoxic state in BeWo b30s. Reperfusion restored the expression of indirect hypoxia genes and ER stress genes. Coculturing THP-1 monocytes with normoxic, hypoxic, and hypoxic-reperfused BeWo b30s promoted b30 survival but not wound-healing capacity. Compared to hypoxic-reperfused BeWos, hypoxic cells increased monocyte adhesion and inflammatory gene expression, decreased monocyte phagocytosis, and did not change monocyte migration. Finally, placental signaling in early-onset PE decreased monocyte chemotaxis, but monocyte precondition more strongly influenced migration compared to placental state.\n\nDiscussionOverall, hypoxic placental signals most effectively recapitulate monocyte functional behavior observed in preeclampsia. Further research is needed to understand spatial and temporal changes in monocyte-trophoblast interactions and pregnancy outcomes. Monocyte chemotaxis to primary placental signals varied by gestational age, maternal diagnosis, and monocyte condition, implying monocytes could be used as functional biomarkers to predict their behavior at the maternal-fetal interface as well as the onset of disease.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=79 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/558721v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15dae34org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@157dec7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e2db81org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b90ab6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "A fibrocartilaginous connection between the tendon and bone, plays a critical role in transferring force from muscle to bone to enable joint movement. However, due to the high mechanical stress it experiences, the enthesis is vulnerable to injury and incapable of regenerating. The spatial relationship and functional basis of the principal components of the fibrocartilage - mineral and collagen - have not been clearly elucidated, which is a significant remaining gap in reconstructing complex architectures for promoting interface tissue regeneration. Here, using three-dimensional electron tomography imaging and high-resolution two-dimensional electron microscopy, we discover that mineral particles form a continuous cross-fibrillar phase within the fibrocartilage region. By developing a \"floating mineralization\" system, we fabricate a three-layer hydrogel that mimics the hierarchical nano- to micro-scale structure of tendon-bone interface (TBI). The middle layer is noteworthy for its resemblance to the nanostructure of fibrocartilage and its superior ability to induce mineralized fibrochondrogenesis in vitro. Based on motor function analysis, imaging diagnosis, histological staining, immunofluorescence staining, and biomechanics performance, we demonstrate that in situ transplantation of the gradient hydrogel achieved tendon-fibrocartilage-bone synchronous regeneration and result in 68% maximum mechanical recovery at 8-week postoperation. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that a unique atlas of in situ stem/progenitor cells is generated during the TBI healing in vivo. Notably, the bio-inspired hydrogel microenvironment drived endogenous Gli1+Dkk3+ progenitor cells, playing a key role in TBI regeneration. Therefore, we have successfully decoded and reconstructed the nanostructure of fibrocartilage, which has great potential in TBI regeneration.",

    "abstract": "In daily life, two common algorithms are used for collecting medical disease data: data integration of medical institutions and questionnaires. However, these statistical methods require collecting data from the entire research area, which consumes a significant amount of manpower and material resources. Additionally, data integration is difficult and poses privacy protection challenges, resulting in a large number of missing data in the dataset. The presence of incomplete data significantly reduces the quality of the published data, hindering the timely analysis of data and the generation of reliable knowledge by epidemiologists, public health authorities, and researchers.\n\nConsequently, this affects the downstream tasks that rely on this data. To address the issue of discrete missing data in cardiac disease, this paper proposes the AGAN (Attribute Generative Adversarial Nets) architecture for missing data filling, based on generative adversarial networks. This algorithm takes advantage of the strong learning ability of generative adversarial networks. Given the ambiguous meaning of filling data in other network structures, the attribute matrix is designed to directly convert it into the corresponding data type, making the actual meaning of the filling data more evident. Furthermore, the distribution deviation between the generated data and the real data is integrated into the loss function of the generative adversarial networks, improving their training stability and ensuring consistency between the generated data and the real data distribution. This approach establishes the missing data filling mechanism based on the generative adversarial networks, which ensures the rationality of the data distribution while filling the missing data samples. The experimental results demonstrate that compared to other filling algorithms, the data matrix filled by the proposed algorithm in this paper has more evident practical significance, fewer errors, and higher accuracy in downstream classification prediction.",

    "abstract": "Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae (Pca) is an important foliar pathogen of oat which causes crown rust disease. The virulence profile of 48 Pca isolates derived from different locations in Australia was characterised using a collection of oat lines often utilised in rust surveys in the USA and Australia. This analysis indicates that Pca populations in Eastern Australia are broadly virulent, in contrast to the population in Western Australia (WA). Several oat lines/Pc genes are effective against all rust samples collected from WA, suggesting they may provide useful resistance in this region if deployed in combination. We identified 19 lines from the US oat differential set that display disease resistance to Pca in WA, some in agreement with previous rust survey reports. We adopted the 10-letter nomenclature system to define oat crown rust races in Australia and compare the frequency of those virulence traits to published data from the USA. Based on this nomenclature, 42 unique races were detected among the 48 isolates, reflecting the high diversity of virulence phenotypes for Pca in Australia. Nevertheless, the Pca population in the USA is substantially more broadly virulent than that of Australia. Close examination of resistance profiles for the oat differential set lines after infection with Pca supports hypotheses of allelism or redundancy among Pc genes or the presence of several R genes in some oat differential lines. These findings illustrate the need to deconvolute the oat differential set using molecular tools.",

    "abstract": "Human and non-human primate data clearly implicate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as critical for advanced cognitive functions1,2. It is thought that intracortical synaptic architectures within dlPFC are the integral neurobiological substrate that gives rise to these processes, including working memory, inferential reasoning, and decision-making3-7. In the prevailing model, each cortical column makes up one fundamental processing unit composed of dense intrinsic connectivity, conceptualized as the  canonical cortical microcircuit3,8. Each cortical microcircuit receives sensory and cognitive information from a variety of sources which are represented by sustained activity within the microcircuit, referred to as persistent or recurrent activity4,9. Via recurrent connections within the microcircuit, activity can propagate for a variable length of time, thereby allowing temporary storage and computations to occur locally before ultimately passing a transformed representation to a downstream output4,5,10. Competing theories regarding how microcircuit activity is coordinated have proven difficult to reconcile in vivo where intercortical and intracortical computations cannot be fully dissociated5,9,11,12. Here, we interrogated the intrinsic features of isolated microcircuit networks using high-density calcium imaging of macaque dlPFC ex vivo. We found that spontaneous activity is intrinsically maintained by microcircuit architecture, persisting at a high rate in the absence of extrinsic connections. Further, using perisulcal stimulation to evoke persistent activity in deep layers, we found that activity propagates through stochastically assembled intracortical networks, creating predictable population-level events from largely non-overlapping ensembles. Microcircuit excitability covaried with individual cognitive performance, thus anchoring heuristic models of abstract cortical functions within quantifiable constraints imposed by the underlying synaptic architecture.",

Contextual information and prior knowledge facilitate perceptual processing, improving our recognition of even distorted or obstructed visual inputs. As a result, neuronal processing elicited by identical sensory inputs varies depending on the context in which we encounter those inputs. This modulation is in line with predictive processing accounts of vision which suggest that the brain uses internal models of the world to predict sensory inputs, with cortical feedback processing in sensory areas encoding beliefs about those inputs. As such, acquiring knowledge should enhance our internal models that we use to resolve sensory ambiguities, and feedback signals should encode more accurate estimates of sensory inputs. We used partially occluded Mooney images, ambiguous two-tone images which are difficult to recognise without prior knowledge of the image content, in behavioural and 3T fMRI experiments to measure if contextual feedback signals in early visual areas are modulated by learning. We show that perceptual priors add sensory detail to contextual feedback processing in early visual areas in response to subsequent presentations of previously ambiguous images.",

Here, we show that hnRNPL is essential for B cell activation, and thereby germinal center and antibody responses. Upon activation, hnRNPL-deficient B cells show proliferation defects and increased apoptosis. Comparative analysis of RNA-seq data from activated B cells and another 8 hnRNPL-depleted cell types reveals a common function in the MYC and E2F transcriptional programs required for proliferation, likely borne out of alternative splicing changes affecting multiple transcription regulators. Notably, while individual gene expression changes were cell type specific, several alternative splicing events affecting histone modifiers like, KDM6A, NSD2, and SIRT1, were conserved across cell types, which could contribute to gene expression changes and other phenotypes upon hnRNPL loss. In line with reduced SIRT1, hnRNPL-deficient B cells had dysfunctional mitochondria and ROS overproduction, which could contribute to defects in B cell activation. Thus, hnRNPL is essential for the resting-to-activated B cell transition by regulating transcriptional programs and metabolism, most likely through the alternative splicing of several histone modifiers.",

    "abstract": "The growth and survival of cells with different fitness, such as those with a proliferative advantage or a deleterious mutation, is controlled through cell competition. During development, cell competition enables healthy cells to eliminate less fit cells that could jeopardize tissue integrity, and facilitates the elimination of pre-malignant cells by healthy cells as a surveillance mechanism to prevent oncogenesis. Malignant cells also benefit from cell competition to promote their expansion. Despite its ubiquitous presence, the mechanisms governing cell competition, particularly those common to developmental competition and tumorigenesis, are poorly understood. Here, we show that in Drosophila, the planar cell polarity (PCP) protein Flamingo (Fmi) is required by winners to maintain their status during cell competition in malignant tumors to overtake healthy tissue, in pre-malignant cells as they grow among wildtype cells, in healthy cells to eliminate pre-malignant cells, and by supercompetitors to occupy excessive territory within wildtype tissues. \"Would-be\" winners that lack Fmi are unable to over-proliferate, and instead become losers. We demonstrate that the role of Fmi in cell competition is independent of PCP, and that it uses a distinct mechanism that may more closely resemble one used in other less well defined functions of Fmi.",

    "abstract": "Copy number variation (CNV) can drive rapid evolution in changing environments. In microbial pathogens, such adaptation is a key factor underpinning epidemics and colonization of new niches. However, the genomic determinants of such adaptation remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically investigate CNVs in one of the largest to date genome sequencing dataset spanning a worldwide collection of 1109 genomes from the major wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We found overall strong purifying selection acting on most CNVs. Genomic defense mechanisms likely accelerated gene loss over episodes of continental colonization. Local adaptation along climatic gradients was facilitated by CNVs affecting secondary metabolite production and gene loss in general. One of the strongest candidates for climatic adaptation is a highly conserved gene of the NAD-dependent Sirtuin family. The Sirtuin CNV locus localizes to an [~]68-kb Starship mobile element unique to the species carrying genes highly expressed during plant infection. The element has likely lost the ability to transpose, demonstrating how the ongoing domestication of cargo-carrying selfish elements can contribute to selectable variation within populations. Our work highlights how standing variation in gene copy numbers at the global scale is a major factor driving climatic and metabolic adaptation in microbial species.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental illnesses worldwide, exhibit high heritability, and affect twice as many women as men. To evaluate potential interactions between genetic background and cycling ovarian hormones on sex differences in susceptibility to negative valence behaviors relevant to anxiety disorders, we assayed avoidance behavior and cued threat memory dynamics in gonadally-intact adult male and female mice across four common inbred mouse strains: C57Bl/6J, 129S1/SVlmJ, DBA/2J, and BALB/cJ. Independent of sex, C57Bl/6J mice exhibited low avoidance but high threat memory, 129S1/SvlmJ mice high avoidance and high threat memory, DBA/2J mice low avoidance and low threat memory, and BALB/cJ mice high avoidance but low threat memory. Within-strain comparisons revealed reduced avoidance behavior in the high hormone phase of the estrous cycle (proestrus) compared to all other estrous phases in all strains except DBA/2J, which did not exhibit cycle-dependent behavioral fluctuations. Robust and opposing sex differences in threat conditioning and extinction training were found in the C57Bl/6J and 129S1/SvlmJ lines, whereas no sex differences were observed in the DBA/2J or BALB/cJ lines. C57Bl/6J males exhibited enhanced acute threat memory, whereas 129S1/SvlmJ females exhibited enhanced sustained threat memory, compared to their sex-matched littermates. These effects were not mediated by estrous cycle stage or sex differences in active versus passive defensive behavioral responses. Our data demonstrate that core features of behavioral endophenotypes relevant to anxiety disorders, such as avoidance and threat memory, are genetically driven yet dissociable and can be influenced further by cycling ovarian hormones.",

    "abstract": "Mapping information from photographic images to volumetric medical imaging scans is essential for linking spaces with physical environments, such as in image-guided surgery. Current methods of accurate photographic image to computed tomography (CT) image mapping can be computationally intensive and/or require specialized hardware. For general purpose 3-D mapping of bulk specimens in histological processing, a cost-effective solution is necessary. Here, we compare the integration of a commercial 3-D camera and cell phone imaging with a surface registration pipeline. Using surgical implants and chuck-eye steak as phantom tests, we obtain 3-D CT reconstruction and sets of photographic images from two sources: Canfield Imagings H1 camera and an iPhone 14 Pro. We perform surface reconstruction from the photographic images using commercial tools and open-source code for Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) respectively. We complete surface registration of the reconstructed surfaces with the iterative closest point (ICP) method. Manually placed landmarks were identified at three locations on each of the surfaces. Registration of the Canfield surfaces for three objects yields landmark distance errors of 1.747, 3.932, and 1.692 mm, while registration of the respective iPhone camera surfaces yields errors of 1.222, 2.061, and 5.155 mm.

This 3D model incorporated alveolar and vascular components that allow for a comprehensive exploration of lung physiology and responses to infection in vitro. In particular, we investigated the intricate role of ventilation on formation of the alveolar epithelial layer and its response to viral infections. In this regard, we subjected our 3D printed, perfused lung model to a continuous respiratory cycle at the air-liquid interface (ALI) for up to 10 days followed by infection with two viruses: influenza virus (Pr8) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), at two different concentrations for 24 or 48 h. The results revealed that ventilation induced increased tight-junction formation with better epithelial barrier function over time, facilitated higher expression of alveolar epithelial specific genes, enabled higher level of infection with an increased progression of viral spread and replication over time, and modulated the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Our findings represent a critical step forward in advancing our understanding of lung-specific viral responses and respiratory infections in response to ventilation, which sheds light on vital aspects of pulmonary physiology and pathobiology.",

DPM statistically prioritises genes and pathways that change consistently across the datasets, while penalising those violating the constraints. Joint analyses of transcriptomic, proteomic, DNA methylation, and clinical datasets of cancer samples demonstrate how directional integration identifies genes and pathways modulated across omics datasets, highlights those with inconsistent evidence, and reveals candidate biomarkers with prognostic signals in multiple datasets.

It occurs in large scale significance testing as well as in rank-based selection, and imperils reproducibility of findings and follow-up study design. Several methods correcting for this selection bias have been proposed, but questions remain on their relative performance and susceptibility to dependence between features since comparative studies are missing.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate how empirical Bayes methods tackling selection bias require a custom density estimator for competitive performance under dependence. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive simulation study comparing different classes of correction methods for point estimates as well as confidence intervals, while studying the effect of dependence. We find a bootstrap method by Tan et al. [2015] and empirical Bayes methods to perform best overall for correcting the selection bias, although this correction does not always improve the feature ranking. We apply selection bias correction methods to a comparison of the best single-feature prediction model versus the multi-feature model in predicting Brassica napus phenotypes from gene expression data, demonstrating that the superiority of the best single-feature model may be illusory.\n\nAvailabilityAll R-code used for the analysis is included in the Supplementary information.\n\nContactsteven.maere@psb.vib-ugent.be\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

It was developed using joint analyses of scRNA-Seq datasets derived from a dozen donors, including healthy adult controls, juveniles, and several infertility cases. HISTA is very different than other websites of testis scRNA-seq data, providing visualization and hypothesis testing tools on a batch-removed and integrated dataset of 23429 genes measured across 26093 cells using.\n\nObjectiveThe main goal of this manuscript is to describe HISTA in detail and highlight its unique and novel features.\n\nMethodsTherefore, we used HISTA as a guide for its application and demonstrated HISTAs translational capacity to follow up on two observations of biological relevance.\n\nResultsOur first analytical vignette identifies novel groupings of tightly regulated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) molecules throughout spermatogenesis, suggesting specific functional genomics of these groupings. This analysis also found highly controlled expression of pairs of sense and antisense transcripts, suggesting conjoined regulatory mechanisms. In the next investigative vignette, we examined gene patterns in undifferentiated spermatogonia (USgs). We found the NANOS family of genes function as key drivers of transcriptomic signatures involved in human spermatogonial self-renewal programming; for the first time, demonstrating the relationship of NANOS1/2/3 transcripts in humans with scRNA-seq.\n\nDiscussion and ConclusionsUsing HISTA, we found new observations that contribute to unraveling the mechanisms behind transcriptional regulation and maintenance germ cells across spermatogenesis. Furthermore, our findings provide guidance on future validation studies and experimental direction. Overall, HISTA continues to be utilized in testis-related research, and thus is updated regularly with new analytical methods, visualizations, and data. We aim to have it serve as a research environment for a broad range of investigators looking to explore the testis tissue and male infertility.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationHISTA is available as an interactive web tool: https://conradlab.shinyapps.io/HISTA\n\nSource code and documentation for HISTA are provided on GitHub: https://github.com/eisascience/HISTA",

    "abstract": "Long range projection neurons of the cerebral cortex provide multimodal integration via connectivity between distant areas of the brain, thus are critical for sensory integration, motor processing, and higher cognitive function. During development, distinct subtypes of cortical projection neurons extend their axons to widely distinct areas within the cortex and beyond, sometimes projecting multiple axons simultaneously with precision to several target regions. Correct connectivity is achieved via axon guidance implemented by a growth cone (GC) at the leading tip of each axon. Prior work has identified that local protein synthesis of axonally-trafficked transcripts is required for directional responses to at least some guidance cues, but how distinct subtype- and projection-specific GCs establish, maintain, and regulate their subtype-specific subcellular molecular machinery is essentially unknown. Here we investigate the composition and dynamic regulation of subcellular transcriptomes of two subtypes of cortical projection neurons, with distinct connectivity and function. We compare GC-localized transcriptomes between interhemispheric, callosal projection neurons and corticothalamic projection neurons and across developmental stages, and find pronounced overlap, likely reflecting shared subcellular machinery. Intriguingly, we find that GC-localized transcriptomes of these subtypes of projection neurons are enriched for genes associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases. We then focus on context-specific portions of GC-localized transcriptomes, and identify known and novel potential regulators of distinct phases of circuit development: long-distance growth, gray matter innervation, and synapse formation. Next, we investigate mechanisms by which transcripts are enriched in GCs and dynamically regulated, and find evidence for GC-enriched motifs in 3 untranslated regions. As an exemplar, we identify cytoplasmic adenylation element binding protein 4 (CPEB4) as potentially regulating localization and translation of mRNAs encoding molecular machinery important for axonal branching and complexity. Additionally, we identify RNA binding motif single stranded interacting protein 1 (RBMS1) as a dynamically expressed regulator of RNA stabilization that enables successful callosal circuitry formation. Elucidation of context-specific subcellular RNA localization, and likely stability, is a critical advance toward a mechanistic understanding of local GC processes involved in circuit development, maintenance, and function. Even subtle changes in the precision of associative and integrative cortical circuits can have pronounced effects on cortical function, and lead to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, integrated knowledge of GC- and soma-localized molecular controls involved in circuit formation will be necessary to fully understand the etiologies of these diseases and enable targeted therapeutics.",

Machine learning (ML)-based identification and generation of antigen-specific immune receptors is potentially immense value for public health. The ideal training data for such ML tasks would be AIR datasets, where each sequence is labeled with its cognate antigen. However, given current technological constraints, sequence-labeled datasets are scarce, contrasted by an abundance of repertoire-labeled ones - AIR repertoire datasets where only the repertoire dataset, but not the individual AIRs, are labeled. Therefore, an unmet need exists for an ML approach that enables predictive identification and generation of disease-specific novel AIR sequences using exclusively repertoire-level immune status information. To address this need, we developed AIRRTM, an end-to-end generative model using an encoder-decoder architecture and Topic Modeling (TM) that requires exclusively repertoire-labeled AIR sequencing data as input. We validated AIRRTMs capacity to identify and generate novel disease-associated receptors on several ground truth synthetic datasets of increasingly complex immune signals and experimental data. AIRRTM broadens the discovery space for immunotherapeutics by enabling the exploitation of large-scale and broadly available immune repertoire data previously deemed largely unsuitable for this task.",

    "abstract": "Syndecan 4 (SDC4), a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan, is known to regulate matrix catabolism by nucleus pulposus cells in an inflammatory milieu. However, the role of SDC4 in the aging spine has never been explored. Here we analyzed the spinal phenotype of SDC4 global knockout (KO) mice as a function of age. Micro-computed tomography showed that SDC4 deletion severely reduced vertebral trabecular and cortical bone mass, and biomechanical properties of vertebrae were significantly altered in SDC4 KO mice. These changes in vertebral bone were due to elevated osteoclastic activity in KO mice. The histological assessment also showed subtle phenotypic changes in the intervertebral discs. Imaging-Fourier transform-infrared (FTIR) analyses showed a reduced relative ratio of mature collagen crosslink in young adult NP and AF compartments of KO compared to wildtype (WT) mice. Additionally, relative chondroitin sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) levels increased in the NP compartment of the KO mice. Transcriptomic analysis of NP tissue using CompBio, an AI-based tool showed biological themes associated with prominent dysregulation of heparan sulfate GAG degradation, mitochondria metabolism, autophagy, and endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi protein processing. Overall, this study highlights the important role of SDC4 in fine-tuning vertebral bone homeostasis and extracellular matrix homeostasis in the intervertebral disc.",

    "abstract": "Five years after the well-known study on insect biomass decline in nature protected habitats in Germany over three decades, the project DINA (Diversity of Insects in Nature protected Areas) has investigated the status of insects in 21 selected nature reserves across Germany in the years 2020 and 2021. We used the same methods and protocols for trapping and measuring the biomass of flying insects as in the mentioned study. Across two seasons, we accumulated a comprehensive data set of 1621 data points of two-week emptying intervals. The measured overall insect biomass remained at low levels and corresponds to the published latest figures from the years 2007-2016. There were no significant regional differences, but biomass was negatively correlated with agricultural production area within 2 km of nature reserves. Differences between the two consecutive years were very likely due to well-known natural fluctuations of insect populations, changes in agricultural cultivation and local weather events. The results show that protected habitats are essential for insects, but not sufficient in their function, and that further steps need to be taken for a better protection and sustainment of insects, which fulfil key functions in many ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Understanding cancer cell mechanics allows for the identification of novel disease mechanisms, diagnostic biomarkers, and targeted therapies. In this study, we utilized our previously established fluid shear stress assay to investigate and compare the viscoelastic properties of normal immortalized human astrocytes (IHAs) and invasive human glioblastoma (GBM) cells when subjected to physiological levels of shear stress that are present in the brain microenvironment. We used a parallel-flow microfluidic shear system and a camera-coupled optical microscope to expose single cells to fluid shear stress and monitor the resulting deformation in real-time, respectively. From the video-rate imaging, we fed cell deformation information from digital image correlation into a three-parameter generalized Maxwell model to quantify the nuclear and cytoplasmic viscoelastic properties of single cells. We further quantified actin cytoskeleton density and alignment in IHAs and GBM cells via immunofluorescence microscopy and image analysis techniques. Results from our study show that contrary to the behavior of many extracranial cells, normal and cancerous brain cells do not exhibit significant differences in their viscoelastic behavior. Moreover, we also found that the viscoelastic properties of the nucleus and cytoplasm as well as the actin cytoskeletal densities of both brain cell types are similar. Our work suggests that malignant GBM cells exhibit unique mechanical behaviors not seen in other cancer cell types. These results warrant future study to elucidate the distinct biophysical characteristics of the brain and reveal novel mechanical attributes of GBM and other primary brain tumors.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulation, involving the complex interplay between regulatory sequences and proteins, directs all biological processes. Computational models of transcriptions lack generalizability to accurately extrapolate in unseen cell types and conditions. Here, we introduce GET, an interpretable foundation model, designed to uncover regulatory grammars across 213 human fetal and adult cell types. Relying exclusively on chromatin accessibility data and sequence information, GET achieves experimental-level accuracy in predicting gene expression even in previously unseen cell types. GET showcases remarkable adaptability across new sequencing platforms and assays, enabling regulatory inference across a broad range of cell types and conditions, and uncovering universal and cell type specific transcription factor interaction networks. We evaluated its performance on prediction of regulatory activity, inference of regulatory elements and regulators, and identification of physical interactions between transcription factors. Specifically, we show GET outperforms current models in predicting lentivirus-based massive parallel reporter assay readout with reduced input data. In Fetal erythroblast, we identify distal (>1Mbp) regulatory regions that were missed by previous models. In B cell, we identified a lymphocyte-specific transcription factor-transcription factor interaction that explains the functional significance of a lymphoma-risk predisposing germline mutation. In sum, we provide a generalizable and accurate model for transcription together with catalogs of gene regulation and transcription factor interactions, all with cell type specificity.",

    "abstract": "Powdery mildew (PM), caused by the fungus, Blumeria graminis tritici is a devastating and notorious disease that is prevalent across the globe and causes up to 62% of yield losses in wheat. The well-known 68 PM resistance loci (Pm1 -Pm68) are not long-lasting and break down when new races of pathogens interact with host plants. The editing of three known MLO genes through CRISPR/Cas9 has conferred resistance against PM. However, only seven MLO genes were known in wheat to date. Taking advantage of IWGSC Ref-seq v2.1 and using the gold-standard analysis pipeline that we have designed, we expanded this number to 47 and reported 40 additional potential CRISPR targets that can be used to develop PM resistance, disease resistance, and abiotic stress tolerance in wheat. We also performed phylogenetic, gene structure, and MOTIF analysis that indicated conserved evolutionary patterns, and the phylogenetic pattern was strongly supported by gene structure and MOTIF analysis. The gene duplication and evolution analysis showed that segmental duplications were prevalent and purifying selection operated during evolution. Comparative phylogenetic analysis with Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon depicted that clade IV was exclusive for monocots. Finally, MLOs are expressed under powdery mildew, rusts, head blight, abiotic stresses, growth, and development thus TraesMLOs have a potential role in wheat under these conditions. Therefore, we hope that the MLO genes identified in this study will be edited through CRISPR/Cas9 or will be overexpressed to develop PM and disease-resistant and abiotic stress-tolerant wheat. Additionally, we performed most of the above-mentioned analyses for Arabidopsis thaliana, revised its numbers as compared to the TAIR database, and updated it outdated analysis performed in 2003.",

    "abstract": "Thyroid hormones (THs) are important regulators of systemic energy metabolism. In the liver, they stimulate lipid and cholesterol turnover and increase systemic energy bioavailability. It is still unknown how the TH state interacts with the circadian clock, another important regulator of energy metabolism. We addressed this question using a mouse model of hypothyroidism and performed circadian analyses. Low TH levels decreased locomotor activity, food intake, and body temperature mostly in the active phase. Concurrently, liver transcriptome profiling showed only subtle effects compared to elevated TH conditions. Comparative circadian transcriptome profiling revealed alterations in mesor, amplitude, and phase of transcript levels in the livers of low-TH mice. Genes associated with cholesterol uptake, biosynthesis, and bile acid secretion showed reduced mesor. Increased and decreased cholesterol levels in the serum and liver were identified, respectively. Combining data from low- and high-TH conditions allowed the identification of 516 genes with mesor changes as molecular markers of the liver TH state. These genes participate in many known TH-associated processes. We further explored these genes and created a unique expression panel that can assess liver TH state in a time-of-day dependent manner. Our findings suggest that the liver has a low TH state under physiological conditions. Circadian profiling reveals genes as potential markers of liver TH state in one-time point studies.",

    "abstract": "Accelerated imaging has been broadly adopted in diffusion MRI studies, yet little is known about its impacts. Acceleration can achieve higher spatial and q-space resolution in shorter time, reduce motion artifacts, and reduce patient burden. However, it leads to noise amplification, and its impacts in clinical cohorts are poorly understood. This study examined the impact of multiband (also called simultaneous multislice, or SMS) and in-plane acceleration (IPA, also called phase acceleration) in diffusion imaging in forty older adults differing in cognitive status. We evaluated a total of 400 scans from five acquisitions: no acceleration (S1P1); SMS=3 with no in-plane acceleration (S3P1); SMS=3 with IPA=2 (S3P2); S6P1; and S6P2. The number of diffusion directions and b-values was kept constant such that acquisition times varied from 21:28 to 3:56. We found that diffusion metrics were highly sensitive to acceleration factor, with a trend towards higher fractional anisotropy (FA) and lower orientation dispersion (OD) with acceleration. The differences between accelerated and unaccelerated acquisitions could be partly explained by the noise amplification (g-factor) and reduced motion. Intraclass correlations (ICCs) of FA and OD in white matter were excellent in both S1P1 and S3P1 (median >0.8), good but lower in S3P2 and S6P1 (medians around 0.70), and poor to fair in S6P2 (medians 0.46 and 0.57). In-plane acceleration decreased ICC, including areas of high susceptibility distortion. In a comparison of mild cognitive impairment versus healthy controls, acceleration tended to reduce group differences, particularly in the fornix, with greater costs in OD than FA. Our results provide guidance regarding the costs of acceleration (possible biases and reduced effect sizes) while also characterizing the benefits (reduced motion, good reliability at higher multiband with no in-plane).",

Our understanding of the disease etiology is incomplete; however, there is consensus that a reduction-oxidation (redox) imbalance plays a role. In this study we use the autofluorescent properties of two redox molecules, NAD(P)H and FAD, to quantify changes in their relative abundance in living lung tissue of mice with experimental lung fibrosis, and in freshly isolated cells from mouse lungs and humans with IPF. Our results identify cell population-specific intracellular redox changes in the lungs in experimental and human fibrosis. We focus particularly on redox changes within collagen producing cells, where we identified a bimodal distribution of NAD(P)H concentrations, establishing NAD(P)Hhigh and NAD(P)Hlow sub-populations. NAD(P)Hhigh fibroblasts exhibited elevated pro-fibrotic gene expression and decreased collagenolytic protease activity relative to NAD(P)Hlow fibroblasts. The NAD(P)Hhigh population was present in healthy lungs but expanded with time after bleomycin injury suggesting a potential role in fibrosis progression. We identified a similar increased abundance of NAD(P)Hhigh cells in freshly dissociated lungs of subjects with IPF relative to controls, and similar reductions in collagenolytic activity in this cell population. These data highlight the complexity of redox state changes in experimental and human pulmonary fibrosis and the need for selective approaches to restore redox imbalances in the fibrotic lung.",

    "abstract": "The brown seaweed Rugulopteryx okamurae (Dictyotales, Ochrophyta), native to the Pacific Ocean and widely distributed in Asia, has been recently recognized as an emblematic case of biological invasion by marine macroalgae in European waters. Since 2015 and from the Strait of Gibraltar, R. okamurae has rapidly spread towards Atlantic and Mediterranean coastal areas exhibiting an invasive behaviour with significant ecological and economic impacts. Here, we report by morphology and genetics the first observation of this species in Italy along the north-western coast of Sicily (Gulf of Palermo), as drifted material and an established population on Posidonia oceanica, representing its new eastern distribution limit in the Mediterranean Sea, previously established in Marseilles (France). Furthermore, we have performed with the current introduced distribution of the species a favorability distribution model for the Mediterranean, which shows most of the western Mediterranean, including the Balearic archipelago, Corsica and Sardinia, central Mediterranean, including Sicily, and the northern coast of Africa together with eastern Mediterranean basin, as highly favorable for R. okamurae. Arrival of the species into this new area is suggested by means of sea currents and maritime traffic, including fishing activities, hypothesis supported by some of the ranked variables that entered the favorability model, i.e, current velocity, and proximity of fishing ports. These results are a warning that the species can cover large sea distances favored by sea currents, thus also threatening the ecosystems and marine resources of the central and eastern Mediterranean, highly favorable regions for the species. We suggest coordinated actions at the European level regarding prevention, among which those that have the complicity of the fishing sector should be considered, both because it is a highly affected sector and because it potentially has a very important role in the dispersion of the species.",

    "abstract": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive optical neuroimaging technique that is portable and acoustically silent, has become a promising tool for evaluating auditory brain functions in hearing-vulnerable individuals. This study, for the first time, used fNIRS to evaluate neuroplasticity of speech processing in older adults. Ten older adults, most of whom had moderate-to-mild hearing loss, participated in a 4-week speech-in-noise training. Their speech-in-noise performances and fNIRS brain responses to speech (auditory sentences in noise), nonspeech (spectrally-rotated speech) and visual (flashing chequerboards) stimuli were evaluated pre-(T0) and post-training (immediately post-training, T1; and after a 4-week retention, T2). Behaviourally, speech-in-noise performances were improved after retention (T2 vs. T0) but not immediately post-training (T1 vs. T0). Neurally, brain responses to speech vs. nonspeech in the left frontal cortex decreased significantly post-training (both T1 and T2 vs. T0), reflecting possible alleviation of listening efforts. Furthermore, functional connectivity was significantly enhanced between temporal, parietal and frontal lobes, mainly after retention (T2 vs. T0), corresponding to the significant behavioural improvements. Finally, connectivity was significantly decreased between auditory and higher-level non-auditory (parietal and frontal) cortices in response to visual stimuli post-training (T1 vs. T0), indicating decreased cross-modal takeover of speech-related regions during visual processing. The results thus showed that neuroplasticity can be observed before behavioural changes. To our knowledge, this is the first fNIRS study to evaluate speech-based auditory neuroplasticity in older adults. It thus provides important implications for auditory neuroscience research by illustrating the promises of detecting auditory neuroplasticity using fNIRS in hearing-vulnerable individuals.",

    "abstract": "Psychedelics are attractive potential therapeutic agents for treatment resistant depression due to their rapid and sustained effects. These effects have been largely attributed to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) receptor agonism, especially at the 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR). Recent human functional neuroimaging studies report dramatic 5-HT2AR-dependent changes in behavior and functional network organization that presumably reflect neuromodulatory effects. However, serotonin also has potent vasoactive effects that have not been assessed in prior imaging studies of classic (i.e., 5-HT2AR agonists) psychedelics. We assessed the neural, hemodynamic, and neurovascular coupling (NVC) effects of the hallucinogenic 5-HT2A receptor agonist, 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), using wide-field optical imaging (WFOI) in mice during both awake, whisker stimulation and under awake, resting-state conditions. Under both task and resting-state conditions, DOI narrowed hemodynamic response functions and enhanced transduction of neuronal activity in the delta band. These effects were regionally specific and strongest in association regions. Co-administration of DOI and 5-HT2aR antagonist, MDL100907, reversed the effects of DOI on NVC. These DOI-induced NVC alterations imply a dissociation between neuronal versus hemodynamic signals and emphasize the need to consider the neurovascular effects of psychedelics when interpreting hemodynamic measures of neuronal activity.",

We extend these findings in a severe amnesic patient (caused by bilateral hippocampal damage), whose memory and re-experiencing lacked the normal dependency on the sense of self.

    "abstract": "While the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) and hyperphosphorylated-tau (hp-tau) as two classical histopathological biomarkers are crucial in Alzheimers disease (AD), their detailed interaction with the electrophysiological changes at the meso- and macroscale are not yet fully understood. We developed a mechanistic mequltiscale model of AD progression, linking proteinopathy to its effects on neural activity and vice-versa. We integrated a heterodimer model of prion-like protein propagation, and a network of Jansen-Rit electrical oscillators whose model parameters varied due to neurotoxicity. Changes in inhibition guided the electrophysiological alterations found in AD, and both A{beta} and hp-tau-related inhibition changes were able to produce similar effects independently. Additionally, we found a causal disconnection between cellular hyperactivity and interregional hypersynchrony. Finally, we demonstrated that early A{beta} and hp-tau depositions location determine the spatiotemporal profile of the proteinopathy. The presented model combines the molecular effects of bothA{beta} and hp-tau together with a mechanistic protein propagation model and network effects within a unique closed-loop model. This holds the potential to enlighten the interplay between AD mechanisms on various scales, aiming to develop and test novel hypotheses on the contribution of different AD-related variables to the disease evolution.\n\nSignificance StatementThis research presents a groundbreaking closed-loop model of AD mechanisms, bridging the gap between protein distribution and neural activity. Contrary to prior assumptions, the study reveals that interregional hyper-synchrony and cellular hyperactivity are not directly linked. Notably, the model identifies neural inhibition as a potential causal factor in neurophysiological AD alterations and posits early depositions of A{beta} as a determinant of the spatiotemporal profile of proteinopathy. The significance of this mechanistic disease framework lies in its potential to produce insights into AD evolution and to guide novel treatment strategies. It underscores the importance of further experiments and modelling efforts to refine our understanding of AD, offering hope for more effective treatments and personalized care in the fight against dementia.",

    "abstract": "Resting heart rate may confer risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other adverse cardiovascular events. While the brainstems autonomic control over heart rate is well established, less is known about the regulatory role of higher-level cortical and subcortical brain regions, especially in humans. The present study sought to characterize the brain networks that predict variation in prevailing heart rate in otherwise healthy adults. We used machine learning approaches designed for complex, high-dimensional datasets, to predict variation in instantaneous heart period (the inter-heartbeat-interval) from whole brain hemodynamic signals measured by fMRI. Task-based and resting-state fMRI, as well as peripheral physiological recordings, were taken from two datasets that included extensive repeated measurements within individuals. Our models reliably predicted instantaneous heart period from whole brain fMRI data both within and across individuals, with prediction accuracies being highest when measured within-participants. We found that a network of cortical and subcortical brain regions, many linked to psychological stress, were reliable predictors of variation in heart period. This adds to evidence on brain-heart interactions and constitutes an incremental step towards developing clinically-applicable biomarkers of brain contributions to CVD risk.",

    "abstract": "The term biological motion refers to the peculiar kinematics of living organisms. Their interconnected joints move at a fixed distance from each other, a pattern that is common among all locomotive, rigid animals. Across the animal kingdom, many species have developed specialized circuitry to visually recognize biologically moving stimuli and discriminate them from other patterns. Recently, this skill has also been observed in the distributed visual system of jumping spiders. These eight-eyed animals use three of their eye pairs to perceive motion. Then, the gaze of the remaining pair is shifted towards the detected object for further inspection. When presented with a biologically moving stimulus and a random one, jumping spiders turn to face the latter, demonstrating discrimination. In the current paper, we systematically tested the ability of jumping spiders to discriminate biological from random displays using every single eye-pair, by blocking the others with paint. The animals were able to discriminate the stimuli only when the anterior-lateral eyes were unblocked, performing at chance level with the other pairs. Crucially, the spiders preferred the biological stimulus, not the random one. To explain this preference reversal we hypothesized a model, describing how the anterior-lateral eyes specialization in detecting biological motion feeds into a multi-eye integration system, generating more complex behavior from the combination of the simple, single-eye responses. We propose that this in-built modularity may be a solution to the limited resources of these invertebrates brains, constituting a novel approach to visual processing.",

    "abstract": "Intercellular adhesion complexes must withstand mechanical forces to maintain tissue cohesion, while also retaining the capacity for dynamic remodeling during tissue morphogenesis and repair. Most cell-cell adhesion complexes contain at least one PSD95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain situated between the adhesion molecule and the actin cytoskeleton. However, PDZ-mediated interactions are characteristically nonspecific, weak, and transient, with several binding partners per PDZ domain, micromolar dissociation constants, and bond lifetimes of seconds or less. Here, we demonstrate that the bonds between the PDZ domain of the cytoskeletal adaptor protein afadin and the intracellular domains of the adhesion molecules nectin-1 and JAM-A form molecular catch bonds that reinforce in response to mechanical load. In contrast, the bond between the PDZ3-SH3-GUK (PSG) domain of the cytoskeletal adaptor ZO-1 and the JAM-A intracellular domain becomes dramatically weaker in response to [~]2 pN of load, the amount generated by single molecules of the cytoskeletal motor protein myosin II. These results suggest that PDZ domains can serve as force-responsive mechanical anchors at cell-cell adhesion complexes, and that mechanical load can enhance the selectivity of PDZ-peptide interactions. PDZ mechanosensitivity may thus help to generate the intricate molecular organization of cell-cell junctions and allow junctional complexes to dynamically remodel in response to mechanical load.",

Tumor microenvironment (TME) has been associated with platinum chemoresistance.\n\nMalignant ascites has been used as OC tumor microenvironment and its ability to induce platinum chemoresistance has been investigated.\n\nOur results suggest that exposure to OC ascites induces platinum chemoresistance in 11 of 13 cases (85%) on OC cells.

Cytokine array analysis revealed that IL -6 and to a lesser extent HGF were enriched in OC ascites, whereas IL -22 was enriched in cirrhotic ascites. Pharmaceutical inhibitors targeting the IL -6/ JAK pathway were mildly effective in overcoming platinum chemoresistance induced by malignant ascites. In contrast, crizotinib, an HGF/c-MET inhibitor, and 2-hydroxyestradiol (2HE2) were effective in restoring platinum chemosensitivity to OC.\n\nOur results demonstrate the importance of OC ascites in supporting platinum chemoresistance and the potential of combination therapy to restore chemosensitivity of OC cells.",

    "abstract": "Queen honey bees (Apis mellifera) release Queen Mandibular Pheromone (QMP) to regulate traits in the caste of female helpers called workers. QMP signals the queens presence and suppresses worker reproduction. In the absence of reproduction, young workers take care of the queen and her larvae (nurse tasks), while older workers forage. In nurses, QMP increases lipid stores in abdominal fat tissue (fat body) and protein content in hypopharyngeal glands (HPG). HPG are worker-specific head glands that can synthesize royal jelly used in colony nourishment. Larger HPG signifies ability to secrete royal jelly, while shrunken glands characterize foragers that do not make jelly. While it is known that QMP increases abdominal lipid stores, the mechanism is unclear: Does QMP make workers consume more pollen which provides lipids, or does QMP increase lipogenic capacity? Here, we measure abdominal lipogenic capacity as fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity while monitoring abdominal protein content and HPG size in caged workers. Cages allow us to rigorously control worker age, pheromone exposure, and diet. In our 2-factorial design, 3-vs. 8-day-old workers (age factor) were exposed to synthetic QMP or not (pheromone factor) while consuming a lipid deficient diet. We found that QMP did not influence abdominal FAS activity or protein content, but QMP still increased HPG size in the absence of dietary lipids. Our data revealed a positive correlation between abdominal protein content and HPG size. Our findings show that QMP is not a strong modulator of lipogenic capacity in caged worker bees. However, our data may reflect that QMP mobilizes abdominal protein for production of jelly, in line with previous findings on effects of honey bee Brood Pheromone. Overall, our study expands the understanding of how QMP can affect honey bee workers. Such insights are important beyond regulatory biology, as QMP is used in various aspects of beekeeping.",

    "abstract": "To transform speech into words, the human brain must accommodate variability across utterances in intonation, speech rate, volume, accents and so on. A promising approach to explaining this process has been to model electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of brain responses to speech. Contemporary models typically invoke speech categories (e.g. phonemes) as an intermediary representational stage between sounds and words. However, such categorical models are typically hand-crafted and therefore incomplete because they cannot speak to the neural computations that putatively underpin categorization. By providing end-to-end accounts of speech-to-language transformation, new deep-learning systems could enable more complete brain models. We here model EEG recordings of audiobook comprehension with the deep-learning system Whisper. We find that (1) Whisper provides an accurate, self-contained EEG model of speech-to-language transformation; (2) EEG modeling is more accurate when including prior speech context, which pure categorical models do not support; (3) EEG signatures of speech-to-language transformation depend on listener-attention.",

Here we use rapid activity perturbations to demonstrate asymmetric influence between premotor and primary motor cortices on fast timescales during reaching in mice, confirming hierarchy among endogenous firing patterns. However, this hierarchy had a surprising manifestation: firing in each region was dominated by temporally-aligned patterns and was equally predictive of future firing in the other region. Network modeling suggests an explanation: functional hierarchy can be determined by the relative dependence of local circuits on across-region input, rather than asymmetry in that input. We propose that motor cortical firing patterns are primarily defined not by across-region input, but by the constraints of patterning motor output.",

To gain insight into the molecular regulations underlying this neuronal reprogramming process, we applied single-cell multiomics analyses on in vitro ND1-induced AtN conversion to systematically investigate how ND1 changed the fate of astrocytes at transcriptomic and epigenetic levels. Our findings reveal that the initial immature astrocytes go through an intermediate state where both astrocytic and neuronal genes are activated at early stage of AtN conversion. ND1 directly reshapes the chromatin accessibility landscape of astrocytes to that of neurons, promoting expression of endogenous Neurod1 and other neurogenic genes such as Hes6, Insm1 etc. Interestingly, cell proliferation status is highly correlated with conversion rate, and inhibition of cell division significantly reduces the conversion ratio. Moreover, in comparison with another AtN reprogramming transcription factor, ASCL1, external ND1 can activate endogenous Neurod1 and directly promote neuronal gene transcription; whereas external ASCL1 hardly activates endogenous Ascl1, leading to slower and inefficient conversion. Together, our studies demonstrate that in vitro AtN conversion mimics neurogenic transcriptional program in embryonic neurogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Lewy bodies are neuropathologically associated with Lewy body dementia (LBD), but little is known about why they form or their role in the disease process. We previously reported Lewy bodies are a common feature of older individuals with primary mitochondrial diseases. However, as they are not an invariant finding, understanding differences between those with and without Lewy bodies may provide insights into factors that govern the formation of Lewy bodies in Lewy body disease (LBD). The present study sought to investigate whether deficient mitophagy in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction may underlie Lewy body formation. Post-mortem tissue was obtained from the cingulate gyrus and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve (DMV) of mitochondrial disease cases with Lewy bodies, primary mitochondrial disease cases without Lewy bodies, and control cases, in addition to LBD cases as comparison. An array of mitophagy and autophagy markers were quantified in 50 individual neurons per cingulate gyrus and all neurons per DMV using immunofluorescent analysis. No significant differences were found between groups, although there was a striking enrichment of markers of autophagic mitochondria and autophagic vesicles within Lewy bodies. Evaluation of diffuse -synuclein aggregates, thought to precede Lewy body formation, suggested only autophagic mitochondria were present in early aggregates, perhaps suggesting sequestration of dysfunctional mitochondria is an early step in Lewy body formation. To characterise the composition of Lewy bodies, discovery proteomics was performed on isolated insoluble proteins from frozen cingulate gyrus, which identified up-regulation of markers of aggresomes, a regulated cellular response that occurs when protein degradative pathways become overwhelmed, a mechanism of spatial protein quality control (sPQC). Taken together, these findings are consistent with impairment of cellular waste handling pathways in Lewy body-bearing neurons, and that the formation of a Lewy body could be a deliberate cellular response to compartmentalise such waste.",

    "abstract": "Allergic airway inflammation is a chronic inflammatory condition resulting from uncontrolled immune responses to environmental antigens. While it is well-established that allergic immune responses exhibit a high degree of diversity, driven by primary effector cell types like eosinophils, neutrophils, or CD4 T cells with distinct effector signatures, the exact mechanisms responsible for such pathogenesis remain largely elusive. Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) is an essential immune regulator during chronic inflammation including allergic airway inflammation. Emerging evidence suggests that Tregs infiltrating inflamed tissues exhibit distinct phenotypes dependent on the specific tissue sites and can display significant heterogeneity and tissue residency. Whether diverse allergic inflammatory responses in the lung influences infiltrating Treg heterogeneity or Treg lung residency has not previously been explored. We employed an unbiased single-cell RNAseq approach to investigate lung-infiltrating Tregs in models of eosinophilic and neutrophilic airway inflammation models, in which Tregs are critical regulators of inflammation. We found that lung-infiltrating Tregs are highly heterogeneous and that Tregs displaying lung resident phenotypes are significantly different depending on the types of inflammation. Tregs expression of ST2, a receptor for alarmin cytokine IL-33, was predominantly induced by eosinophilic inflammation and by tissue residency. However, Treg-specific ST2 deficiency did not affect the development of eosinophilic allergic inflammation nor the generation of lung resident Tregs. These results uncover a striking heterogeneity among Tregs infiltrating the lungs during allergic airway inflammation. The results also indicate that varying types of inflammation may give rise to phenotypically distinct lung resident Tregs, underscoring a novel mechanism by which inflammatory cues may shape the composition of infiltrating Tregs, allowing them to regulate inflammatory responses through tissue-adapted mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Chlamydia pecorum is a globally endemic livestock pathogen but prevalence data from Switzerland has so far been limited. The present longitudinal study aimed to get an insight into the C. pecorum prevalence in Swiss cattle and investigated infection dynamics. The study population consisted of a bovine herd (n = 308) located on a farm in the north-eastern part of Switzerland. The herd comprised dairy cows, beef cattle and calves all sampled up to five times over a one-year period. At each sampling timepoint, rectal and conjunctival swabs were collected resulting in 782 samples per localization (total n = 1564). Chlamydiaceae screening was performed initially, followed by C. pecorum-specific real-time qPCR on all samples. For C. pecorum-positive samples, bacterial loads were determined. During this study, C. pecorum was the only chlamydial species found. Animal prevalences included 5.2%-11.4%, 38.1%-61.5% and 55%-100% in dairy cows, beef cattle and calves, respectively. In all categories, the number of C. pecorum-positive samples was higher in conjunctival (n = 151) compared to rectal samples (n = 65), however, the average rectal load was higher. At a younger age, the chlamydial prevalence and the mean bacterial loads were significantly higher. Of all sampled bovines, only 9.4% (29/308) were high shedders (number of copies per {micro}l >1000). Calves, which tested positive multiple times, either failed to eliminate the pathogen between sampling timepoints or were reinfected, whereas dairy cows were mostly only positive at one timepoint. In conclusion, C. pecorum was found in healthy Swiss cattle. Our observations suggested that infection takes place at an early age and immunity might develop over time. Although the gastrointestinal tract is supposed to be the main infection site, C. pecorum was not present in rectal samples from dairy cows.",

    "abstract": "The intricate molecular interplay between beneficial fungi and plants is vital to plant growth promotion and induced defense response. This study explored the role of DCL-mediated RNA silencing in the interaction between the biocontrol fungus Clonostachys rosea and wheat roots. We investigated the impact of DCL (Dicer-like) gene deletions in C. rosea on its root colonization ability. Our results revealed that the deletion of dcl2 significantly enhanced C. rosea biomass on wheat roots, indicating a pivotal role of DCL2 in root colonization. Transcriptome sequencing of C. rosea and wheat during their interactions unveiled extensive gene expression changes. In wheat, genes related to stress responses were upregulated during C. rosea interactions, while genes associated with plant cell wall modification and metabolic processes were downregulated, suggesting complex regulatory responses and a trade-off between defense mechanisms and growth promotion. Deletion of C. rosea dcl1 and dcl2 altered the transcriptomic responses of wheat roots during interactions. Wheat genes associated with stress responses were downregulated during interactions with DCL deletion strains. In contrast, genes involved in metabolic processes and growth were upregulated, emphasizing the cross-kingdom regulatory role of C. rosea small RNAs (sRNAs). We identified 18 wheat miRNAs responsive to C. rosea interactions. Furthermore, we identified 24 endogenous and six cross-kingdom potential gene targets for seven and five differentially expressed miRNAs, supported by their inverse gene expression pattern. In C. rosea, we found a large transcriptional reprogramming of genes during interaction with wheat roots. The upregulated genes were associated with carbohydrate and polysaccharide catabolic processes, membrane transporters and effectors. Conversely, downregulated genes were mainly associated with transition metal ion transport and homeostasis processes. The deletion of dcl1 and dcl2 had significant effects on gene expression. A higher number of genes upregulated in WT during the interaction were restored in DCL deletion mutants, suggesting DCL-mediated gene expression regulation. Furthermore, we identified 21 differentially expressed micro-RNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) in C. rosea; nine were DCL-dependent. They had putative gene targets in C. rosea, including transcription factors, effectors, transporters, and enzymes involved in specialized metabolite production. Cross-kingdom RNA silencing was also observed, with seven DCL-dependent C. rosea milRNAs potentially targeting 29 genes in wheat. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial interaction between fungi and plant roots. In addition, the study shed light on the role of sRNA-mediated gene regulation in the C. rosea-wheat interaction, with potential implications for sustainable agriculture and biocontrol strategies.",

    "abstract": "Aged individuals and astronauts experience bone loss despite rigorous physical activity. Bone mechanoresponse is in-part regulated by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that respond to mechanical challenge. Direct delivery of low intensity vibration (LIV) recovers MSC proliferation in senescence and simulated microgravity models, suggesting that reduced mechanical signal delivery within bone marrow may contribute to declining bone mechanoresponse in aging. To answer this question, we have developed a 3D bone marrow analog that controls trabecular geometry, marrow mechanics and external stimuli. Validated finite element (FE) models were developed to quantify strain environment within hydrogels during LIV. Bone marrow analogs with gyroid-based trabeculae of bone volume fractions (BV/TV) corresponding to adult (25%) and aged (13%) mice were printed using polylactic acid (PLA). MSCs encapsulated in migration-permissive hydrogels within printed trabeculae showed robust cell populations on both PLA surface and hydrogel within a week. Following 14 days of LIV treatment (1g, 100 Hz, 1 hour/day), type-I Collagen and F-actin were quantified for the cells in the hydrogel fraction. While LIV increased all measured outcomes, FE models predicted higher von Mises strains for the 13% BV/TV groups (0.2%) when compared to the 25% BV/TV group (0.1%). Despite increased strains, Collagen-I and F-actin measures remained lower in the 13% BV/TV groups when compared to 25% BV/TV counterparts, indicating that LIV response is does not depend on hydrogel strains and that age-related changes in bone fraction directly affects cell behavior in the hydrogel phase independent of the external stimuli. Overall, bone marrow analogs offer a robust and repeatable platform to study bone mechanobiology.",

    "abstract": "Modeling cellular processes in the framework of dynamical systems theories is a focused area in systems and mathematical biology, but a bottleneck to extend the efforts to genome-wide modeling is lack of quantitative data to constrain model parameters. With advances of single cell techniques, learning dynamical information from high throughput snapshot single cell data emerges as an exciting direction in single cell studies. Our previously developed dynamo framework reconstructs generally nonlinear genome-wide gene regulation relations from single cell expression state and either splicing- or metabolic labeling-based RNA velocity data. In this work, we first developed a graph-based machine learning procedure that imposes a mathematical constraint that the RNA velocity vectors lie in the tangent space of the low-dimensional manifold formed by the single cell expression data. Unlike a popular cosine correlation kernel used in literature, this tangent space projection (TSP) preserves the magnitude information of a vector when one transforms between different representations of the data manifold. Next, we formulated a data-driven graph Fokker-Planck (FPE) equation formalism that models the full cellular state transition dynamics as a convection-diffusion process on a data-formed graph network. The formalism is invariant under representation transformation and preserves the topological and dynamical properties of the system dynamics. Numerical tests on synthetic data and experimental scRNA-seq data demonstrate that the graph TSP/FPE formalism built from snapshot single cell data can recapitulate system dynamics.\n\nSignificance StatementA cell is a dynamical system, which responds to extracellular and intracellular cues and changes its internal state. In practice the internal state of a cell is often characterized by its gene expression profile such as its transcriptome measured through destructive single cell techniques. Just like one can use Newtons equations to describe motions of the celestial bodies in the solar system, the state change of a cell in principle can also be described by a set of mathematical equations. Determining the form and associated parameters of such equations, however, is challenging. This work presented a general framework of reconstructing dynamical equations from snapshot single cell data.",
