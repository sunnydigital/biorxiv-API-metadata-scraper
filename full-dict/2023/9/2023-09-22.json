    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics presents the best kind of problem: how to find the many biological insights hidden within complex datasets. Spatially correlated genes can reveal high-interest phenomena like cell-cell interactions and latent variables. We introduce InSituCor, a toolkit for discovering modules of spatially correlated genes. A major contribution is that InSituCor returns only correlations not explainable by obvious factors like the cell type landscape; this spares precious analyst effort for non-trivial findings. InSituCor supports both unbiased discovery of whole-dataset correlations and knowledge-driven exploration of genes of interest. As a special case, it evaluates ligand-receptor pairs for spatial co-regulation.",

    "abstract": "Lipids are critical modulators of membrane protein structure and function. However, it is challenging to investigate the thermodynamics of protein-lipid interactions because lipids can simultaneously bind membrane proteins at different sites with different specificities. Here, we developed a native mass spectrometry (MS) approach using single and double mutants to measure the relative energetic contributions of specific residues on Aquaporin Z (AqpZ) toward cardiolipin (CL) binding. We first mutated potential lipid-binding residues on AqpZ, and mixed mutant and wild-type proteins together with CL. By using native MS to simultaneously resolve lipid binding to the mutant and wild-type proteins in a single spectrum, we directly determined the relative affinities of CL binding, thereby revealing the relative Gibbs free energy change for lipid binding caused by the mutation. Comparing different mutants revealed that the W14 contributes to the tightest CL binding site, with R224 contributing to a lower affinity site. Using double mutant cycling, we investigated the synergy between W14 and R224 sites on CL binding. We uncovered independent binding of the first lipid and positive cooperativity between the residues for binding the second lipid. Overall, this novel native MS approach provides unique insights into lipid binding to specific sites on membrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "Noisy time-series data is commonly collected from sources including Forster Resonance Energy Transfer experiments, patch clamp and force spectroscopy setups, among many others. Two of the most common paradigms for the detection of discrete transitions in such time-series data include: hidden Markov models (HMMs) and step-finding algorithms. HMMs, including their extensions to infinite state-spaces, inherently assume in analysis that holding times in discrete states visited are geometrically-or, loosely speaking in common language, exponentially-distributed. Thus the determination of step locations, especially in sparse and noisy data, is biased by HMMs toward identifying steps resulting in geometric holding times. In contrast, existing step-finding algorithms, while free of this restraint, often rely on ad hoc metrics to penalize steps recovered in time traces (by using various information criteria) and otherwise rely on approximate greedy algorithms to identify putative global optima. Here, instead, we devise a robust and general probabilistic (Bayesian) step-finding tool that neither relies on ad hoc metrics to penalize step numbers nor assumes geometric holding times in each state. As the number of steps themselves in a time-series are, a priori unknown, we treat these within a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) paradigm. We find that the method developed, Bayesian Nonparametric Step (BNP-Step), accurately determines the number and location of transitions between discrete states without any assumed kinetic model and learns the emission distribution characteristic of each state. In doing so, we verify that BNP-Step can analyze sparser data sets containing higher noise and more closely-spaced states than otherwise resolved by current state-of-the-art methods. What is more, BNP-Step rigorously propagates measurement uncertainty into uncertainty over state transition locations, numbers, and emission levels as characterized by the posterior. We demonstrate the performance of BNP-Step on both synthetic data as well as data drawn from force spectroscopy experiments.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEMany time-series data sets exist which are challenging to analyze with current state-of-the-art methods, either because they contain excessive noise or because they violate one or more assumptions inherent to the chosen analysis method. To our knowledge, BNP-Step is the first time-series analysis algorithm which leverages Bayesian nonparametrics to learn the number and location of transitions between states and the emission levels associated to each state, while providing rigorous estimates of uncertainty for the learned quantities. We anticipate our algorithm will allow analysis of data sets at levels of noise or sparsity beyond what current state-of-the-art methods allow, and could potentially reveal previously unknown features in data sets analyzed using existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol (PI) lipids play a crucial role as a vital lipid component in cell membrane domain formation, contributing to cell signaling. In this study, we investigate the impact of PI lipids on the conformational dynamics of tubulin-associated unit (tau) fibrils through multiscale modelling. While prior experimental work by the Lecomte group has demonstrated the influence of PI lipids on the morphology and secondary structure of tau fragments, a detailed molecular understanding of the binding mechanism between tau and PI-incorporated lipids remains absent. Our molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal the intricate molecular mechanisms governing tau binding to PI-incorporated bilayers. Specifically, we conduct MD simulations on lipid patches containing 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (PG), enabling us to explore conformational changes in the R3-R4 section of tau fibrils. Control simulations are conducted on pure lipid patches without tau fibrils, as well as on tau fibrils within bulk water. Our findings demonstrate that PI-incorporated lipids exhibit a stronger affinity for binding to tau fibrils compared to pure PC/PG lipids. All-atom simulations highlight the potential docking sites for PI headgroups at positively charged residues (Lysine, Arginine) on the tau surface. Moreover, the aggregation of PI lipids facilitates tau binding to the membrane. These results not only enhance our comprehension of the disruption of PI-incorporated bilayers, but also shed light on the stability of the tau over the PI containing bilayers.",

Despite advances in therapeutic management and immunotherapy, the five-year survival rate for head and neck cancer remains at [~]66% of all diagnosed cases. A better definition of drivers of HPV-negative HNSCC that are targetable points of tumor vulnerability could lead to significant clinical advances. NSD1 is a histone methyltransferase which catalyzes histone H3 lysine 36 di-methylation (H3K36me2); mutations inactivating NSD1 have been linked to improved outcomes in HNSCC. In this study, we show that NSD1 induces H3K36me2 levels in HNSCC, and that the depletion of NSD1 reduces HNSCC of cell growth in vitro and in vivo. We also find that NSD1 strongly promotes activation of the Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway. NSD1 depletion in HNSCC induces an autophagic gene program activation, causes accumulation of the p62 and LC3B-II proteins, and decreases the autophagic signaling protein ULK1 at both protein and mRNA levels. Reflecting these signaling defects, knockdown of NSD1 disrupts autophagic flux in HNSCC cells. Taken together, these data identify positive regulation of Akt/mTORC1 signaling and autophagy as novel NSD1 functions in HNSCC, suggesting that NSD1 may be of value as a therapeutic target in this cancer.",

    "abstract": "PurposeAtrophy of the hippocampus is an early biomarker of Alzheimers disease (AD) and a main contributor to the patients mnemonic degeneration. While previous research has mostly focused on how hippocampal atrophy impaired long-term memory performance, its relation to short-term memory impairment, which was also found among patients with AD, remains largely uninvestigated. Filling this gap, the current study examined how atrophy in the hippocampus and its subfields may have influenced visual short-term memory (VSTM) in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a common precursor of AD.\n\nMethodsFifty-eight aMCI patients and 69 healthy controls (HC) matched in age were included in the current study. VSTM was assessed using an adapted change detection task with a memory load of 2 or 4 items. Hippocampal subfields were automatically segmented in T1-weighted image using FreeSurfer and were manually inspected for errors. Volumes of the subfields were extracted and compared between aMCI and HC subjects using ANCOVA with age, gender and education as covariates. Furthermore, we also examined the partial correlation between VSTM performances and hippocampal subfield volumes with age, gender and education as covariates.\n\nResultsCompared to HC subjects, aMCI subjects had lower response accuracy (ACC) and lower memory capacity under both load conditions and had longer reaction time (RT) in the 2-load condition. Left hippocampus volume was significantly smaller in aMCI and was positively correlated with ACC and capacity in HC but not in aMCI. Among the hippocampal subfields, left hippocampal tail, left molecular layer, left granule cell molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (GC-ML-DG), left CA4, right hippocampal fissure, bilateral subiculum, bilateral presubiculum, bilateral fimbria, were significantly smaller in aMCI compared to HC. Volumes of the left subiculum, left molecular layer, left GC-ML-DG and left CA4 were positively correlated with ACC and capacity in HC but not in aMCI. Bilateral fimbria volume was negatively correlated with RT under the 2-load condition in HC but not in aMCI.\n\nConclusionThe results of this study suggested that hippocampal atrophy, especially in subfields related to information input and output (e.g. molecular layer, GC-ML-DG, subiculum), may have contributed to VSTM impairment in aMCI by disrupting hippocampal-cortical communications. This finding adds to increasing evidence of hippocampal engagement in short-term memory processes and points to VSTM impairment as a potential neuropsychological indicator for MCI and AD.",

    "abstract": "Cortical electroencephalograms (EEG) may help understanding of neuropsychiatric illness and new treatment mechanisms. The aperiodic component (1/f) of EEG power spectra is often treated as noise, but recent studies suggest that changes to the aperiodic exponent of power spectra may reflect changes in excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, a concept linked to antidepressant effects, epilepsy, autism, and other clinical conditions. One confound of previous studies is behavioral state, because factors associated with behavioral state other than E/I ratio may alter EEG parameters. Thus, to test the robustness of the aperiodic exponent as a predictor of E/I ratio, we analyzed active exploration in mice using video EEG following various pharmacological manipulations with the Fitting Oscillations & One Over F (FOOOF) algorithm. We found that GABAA receptor (GABAAR) positive allosteric modulators increased the aperiodic exponent, consistent with the hypothesis that an increased exponent signals enhanced cortical inhibition, but other drugs (ketamine and GABAAR antagonists at sub-convulsive doses) did not follow the prediction. To tilt E/I ratio more selectively toward excitation, we suppressed the activity of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons with Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). Contrary to our expectations and studies demonstrating increased cortical activity following PV suppression, circuit disinhibition with the DREADD increased the aperiodic exponent. We conclude that the aperiodic exponent of EEG power spectra does not yield a universally reliable marker of E/I ratio. Alternatively, the concept of E/I state may be sufficiently oversimplified that it cannot be mapped readily onto an EEG parameter.\n\nSignificance StateBmentNeuropsychiatric illness is widely prevalent and debilitating. Causes are not well understood, but some hypotheses point toward altered excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance. Here, we use cortical electroencephalograms (EEG) in mice, given applicability of cortical EEG across species, and evaluate the impact of validated drugs, including anxiolytics (pentobarbital and diazepam), along with novel rapid-acting antidepressants (ketamine and allopregnanolone). We focus on analyzing the aperiodic component of EEG power spectra, which may be associated with changes in E/I ratio. We show that aperiodic exponent of EEG power spectra is not a reliable marker of E/I ratio. Moreover, the concept of E/I ratio may be too broad and complex to be defined by an EEG parameter.",

Networks of spiking neurons capture the underlying biophysics of neuronal circuits, yet the dependence of their activity on model parameters is notoriously complex. As a result, heuristic methods have been used to configure spiking network models, which can lead to an inability to discover activity regimes complex enough to match large-scale neuronal recordings. Here we propose an automatic procedure, Spiking Network Optimization using Population Statistics (SNOPS), to customize spiking network models that reproduce the population-wide covariability of large-scale neuronal recordings. We first confirmed that SNOPS accurately recovers simulated neural activity statistics. Then, we applied SNOPS to recordings in macaque visual and prefrontal cortices and discovered previously unknown limitations of spiking network models. Taken together, SNOPS can guide the development of network models and thereby enable deeper insight into how networks of neurons give rise to brain function.",

We demonstrate that subnet communicability strengthens coupling between the structural and functional connectomes better than previous models, including communicability. Over two large datasets, we show that the optimal subnetwork is consistent across the population. Subnet communicability provides new insights into structure-function coupling in the brain and offers a balance between redundancy in message passing and economy of brain wiring.",

    "abstract": "Most studies in psychology, neuroscience, and life science research make inferences about how strong an effect is on average in the population. Yet, many research questions could instead be answered by testing for the universality of the phenomenon under investigation. By using reliable experimental designs that maximise both sensitivity and specificity of individual experiments, each participant or subject can be treated as an independent replication. This approach is common in certain subfields. To date, there is however no formal approach for calculating the evidential value of such small sample studies and to define a priori evidence thresholds that must be met to draw meaningful conclusions. Here we present such a framework, based on the ratio of binomial probabilities between a model assuming the universality of the phenomenon versus the null hypothesis that any incidence of the effect is sporadic. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach, which permits strong conclusions from samples as small as 2-5 participants and the flexibility of sequential testing. This approach will enable researchers to preregister experimental designs based on small samples and thus enhance the utility and credibility of such studies.",

    "abstract": "Heterozygous mutations in any of the six H3K4 methyltransferases (KMT2s) result in monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders, indicating nonredundant yet poorly understood roles of this enzyme family in neurodevelopment. Recent evidence suggests that histone methyltransferase activity may not be central to KMT2 functions; however, the enzymatic activity is evolutionarily conserved, implicating the presence of selective pressure to maintain the catalytic activity. Here, we show that H3K4 methylation is dynamically regulated during prolonged alteration of neuronal activity. The perturbation of H3K4me by the H3.3K4M mutant blocks synaptic scaling, a form of homeostatic plasticity that buffers the impact of prolonged reductions or increases in network activity. Unexpectedly, we found that the six individual enzymes are all necessary for synaptic scaling and that the roles of KMT2 enzymes segregate into evolutionary-defined subfamilies: KMT2A and KMT2B (fly-Trx homologs) for synaptic downscaling, KMT2C and KMT2D (Trr homologs) for upscaling, and KMT2F and KMT2G (dSet homologs) for both directions. Selective blocking of KMT2A enzymatic activity by a small molecule and targeted disruption of the enzymatic domain both blocked the synaptic downscaling and interfered with the activity-dependent transcriptional program. Furthermore, our study revealed specific phases of synaptic downscaling, i.e., induction and maintenance, in which KMT2A and KMT2B play distinct roles. These results suggest that mammalian brains have co-opted intricate H3K4me installation to achieve stability of the expanding neuronal circuits.",

    "abstract": "Individual differences in the spatial organization of resting state networks have received increased attention in recent years. Measures of individual-specific spatial organization of brain networks and overlapping network organization have been linked to important behavioral and clinical traits and are therefore potential biomarker targets for personalized psychiatry approaches. To better understand individual-specific spatial brain organization, this paper addressed three key goals. First, we determined whether it is possible to reliably estimate weighted (non-binarized) resting state network maps using data from only a single individual, while also maintaining maximum spatial correspondence across individuals. Second, we determined the degree of spatial overlap between distinct networks, using test-retest and twin data. Third, we systematically tested multiple hypotheses (spatial mixing, temporal switching, and coupling) as candidate explanations for why networks overlap spatially. To estimate weighted network organization, we adopt the Probabilistic Functional Modes (PROFUMO) algorithm, which implements a Bayesian framework with hemodynamic and connectivity priors to supplement optimization for spatial sparsity/independence. Our findings showed that replicable individual-specific estimates of weighted resting state networks can be derived using high quality fMRI data within individual subjects. Network organization estimates using only data from each individual subject closely resembled group-informed network estimates (which was not explicitly modeled in our individual-specific analyses), suggesting that cross-subject correspondence was largely maintained. Furthermore, our results confirmed the presence of spatial overlap in network organization, which was replicable across sessions within individuals and in monozygotic twin pairs. Intriguingly, our findings provide evidence that network overlap is indicative of linear additive coupling. These results suggest that regions of network overlap concurrently process information from all contributing networks, potentially pointing to the role of overlapping network organization in the integration of information across multiple brain systems.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is the second commonest neurodegenerative disorder and over half of patients progress to postural instability, dementia or death within 10 years of diagnosis.\n\nHowever, onset and rate of progression to poor outcomes is highly variable, underpinned by heterogeneity in the underlying pathological process. Improved biomarkers of poor outcomes would be helpful for targeted treatment, but most studies to-date have been limited to a single modality or the assessment of patients with established cognitive impairment. Here, we use multimodal neuroimaging and plasma biomarkers in 98 patients with PD and 28 age-matched controls followed-up over 3 years, including: gray matter (cortical thickness), white matter (macrostructure: fibre-cross section and microstructure: fibre density) at whole-brain and tract level, structural and functional connectivity and plasma levels of neurofilament light chain (NFL) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 181. We show extensive reductions in fibre cross-section and structural connectivity in PD with poor outcomes, with preserved gray matter and functional connectivity. NFL, but not p-tau181 levels was increased in PD with poor outcomes and correlated with white matter loss. These findings suggest that imaging sensitive to white matter macrostructure and plasma NFL may be useful biomarkers of poor outcomes in PD. As new targeted treatments are emerging, these biomarkers show important potential to aid patient selection for treatments and improve stratification to clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Inherited retinal dystrophies caused by dominant mutations in photoreceptor-expressed genes, are a major cause of irreversible vision loss. Oligonucleotide therapy has been of interest in diseases that conventional medicine cannot target. In the early days, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were explored in clinical trials for retinal disorders with limited success due to a lack of stability and efficient cellular delivery. Thus, an unmet need exists to identify siRNA chemistry that targets photoreceptor-expressed genes. Here we evaluated 12 different fully chemically modified siRNA configurations, where the valency and conjugate structure were systematically altered. The impact on retinal distribution following intravitreal delivery was examined. We found that the increase in valency (tetravalent siRNA) supports the best photoreceptor accumulation. A single intravitreal administration induces multi-months efficacy in rodent and porcine retinas while showing a good safety profile. The data suggest that this configuration can treat retinal diseases caused by photoreceptor-expressed genes with 1-2 intravitreal injections per year.",

This showed that the TCR{beta} repertoire was less diverse and less evenly distributed in foetus compared to young adult. The predicted TCR{beta} CDR3 length and number of non-template insertions were lower than adult in each foetal population, but this difference alone did not account for the reduction in diversity, as all foetal populations contained more clonotypic expansions than adult. We found that life-stage had a greater impact on TCR{beta} and TCR gene segment usage than cell-type. Foetal repertoires showed bias towards 3TRAV and 5TRAJ rearrangements in all populations, whereas adult repertoires used more 5TRAV gene segments, suggesting that progressive TCR rearrangements occur less frequently in foetal DP cells. When we synchronised young adult DP thymocyte differentiation by hydrocortisone treatment the new recovering DP thymocyte population showed more foetal-like 3TRAV and 5TRAJ gene segment usage. In foetus we identified less influence of MHC-restriction on {beta}-chain combinatorial VxJ usage and predicted  and {beta} CDR1xCDR2 usage in SP compared to adult, indicating weaker impact of MHC-restriction on the foetal TCR repertoire.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia bacterial symbionts are widespread across arthropods where they cause reproductive manipulations and/or confer fitness benefits such as protection against viral pathogens. Their self-spreading ability coupled with their antiviral effect has been harnessed in health programmes to curb the transmission of dengue virus. Comparative genomics of Wolbachia strains has been a useful tool to understand the general trends in the evolution of the symbiont genome; however, short-term evolutionary processes occurring within hosts remain poorly explored. Understanding these short-term dynamics is necessary to provide a more complete picture of Wolbachia evolution and will inform ongoing Wolbachia-based disease control interventions. Here we generated six new mosquito cell lines by introducing a range of Wolbachia strains from Drosophila into the symbiont-free Aedes albopictus Aa23 cell line. Following transinfection, we tracked temporal variation in Wolbachia density and identified de novo mutations through re-sequencing of the symbiont genome. Several mutations were associated with major shifts in bacterial density. Moreover, signs of parallel evolution across cell lines, combined with an excess of non-synonymous mutations, indicate that Wolbachia evolution in cell culture is dominated by selective processes rather than genetic drift. Our results also provide new candidate genes likely to be involved in symbiont density regulation. Altogether, our study demonstrates that cell culture is a valuable tool to investigate symbiont short-term evolution, identify the genetic basis of bacterial density variation and for the generation of new higher-density variants for use in control programmes.",

    "abstract": "Agonistic and affiliative interactions with group members dictate individuals access to resources, and investment in competing for resources is often traded off with other needs. For example, reproductive investment can reduce body condition and, thereby, an individuals ability to win future agonistic interactions. However, group members may also alter their behaviour towards reproductive individuals, such as becoming more or less aggressive. Here, we investigated the social consequences of reproduction in female vulturine guineafowl Acryllium vulturinum, a plural breeder in which females disperse and are subordinate to males. We found opposing patterns for breeders within- and between-sex dominance interactions from before to after breeding. Specifically, while breeding females became far less likely to win dominance interactions with non-breeding females after breeding than before breeding, they received considerably fewer male aggressions than non-breeding females after breeding. Using agent-based models, we then show that hierarchies inferred using the Percolation and Conductance method are robust to such variation in interaction rates, while other common methods may be prone to systematically overestimating or underestimating particular individuals hierarchy positions. Our study highlights reproduction as a driver of dominance dynamics, and illustrates how the study of dominance may benefit from considering variation in interaction rates.",

These interactions are of crucial significance in a wide range of biological and technological mechanisms, encompassing selectivity, host recognition, viral penetration, therapeutic delivery, as well as the adhesion phenomena found in cells, polymers, and nanoparticles. In this study, we used computer simulations to investigate 1D and 2D diffusion of adsorbed particles with varying valency but with the same overall affinity to the host. We demonstrate a remarkable diffusion acceleration for particles with increasing valency. Non-diffusing monovalent particle can attain almost unrestricted diffusion when becoming multivalent while retaining its affinity for the host tether or surface. Moreover, diffusion of multivalent particles with rigid ligand distribution can be controlled by patterned host receptors. Our results have practical implications for the design of fast-diffusing particles that maintain a strong affinity for target surfaces or molecules.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/558647v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@61dacdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@63e7b3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@100b7beorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f3d4f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In particular, the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) is fundamental in completing the synaptic neural cycle by allowing the reuptake of serotonin. Its inhibition is particularly attractive, especially as a pharmacological target against depressive syndrome. Here, we analyze, by using long-range molecular dynamic simulations, the behavior of a molecular photoswitch whose cis- and trans-isomers inhibit the hSERT differently. In particular, we evidence the structural and molecular basis behind the higher inhibiting capacity of the cis-isomer, which blocks more efficiently the hSERT conformational cycle leading to serotonin uptake.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/558680v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (98K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@75d82dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c38d43org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6f3c90org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f12399_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapies have revolutionized treatment and management of cancers. However, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in breast cancer is limited due to lack of efficacy. Sialylation, the modification of glycans with sialic acid, is frequently upregulated in various cancer types and has potent immunoregulatory properties. However, its specific role in breast cancer immune evasion has remained largely elusive. Here, we show that breast cancer sialylation drives the recruitment of polymorphonuclear myeloid suppressor cells to the tumor microenvironment, thus hampering the efficient eradication of tumors by CD8+ T cells. Notably, abrogation of tumor sialylation, either genetically or pharmacologically, not only facilitated CD8-mediated tumor control but also enabled the recruitment of Tcf7+ memory T cells. Significantly, abrogation of sialylation sensitized PD-1-resistant breast tumors to immunotherapy. Sialylation interference was well-tolerated in mammary development and function. We further demonstrate that hyper-sialylation occurs in over half of human breast cancers and correlates with poor T cell infiltration. Our results establish sialylation as a central immunoregulator in breast cancer, orchestrating multiple pathways that ultimately culminate in immune evasion. Importantly, our study underscores the potential of targeting this pathway to enhance tumor control, converting immunologically inert tumors into inflamed ones, and prime tumors for synergistic interventions involving immune checkpoint inhibitors.",

The physiological function of EPRS1 in cardiomyocytes (CMs) and the potential effects of CM-specific loss of EPRS1 remain unknown. Here, we found that heterozygous Eprs1 knockout in CMs does not cause any significant changes in CM hypertrophy induced by pressure overload, while homozygous knockout leads to dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and lethality at around 1 month after Eprs1 deletion. Transcriptomic profiling of early-stage Eprs1 knockout hearts suggests a significantly decreased expression of multiple ion channel genes and an increased gene expression in proapoptotic pathways and integrated stress response. Proteomic analysis shows decreased protein expression of multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex components, fatty acid, and branched-chain amino acid metabolic enzymes, as well as a compensatory increase in cytosolic translation machine-related proteins. Immunoblot analysis indicated that multiple proline-rich proteins were reduced at the early stage, which might contribute to cardiac dysfunction of Eprs1 knockout mice. Taken together, this study demonstrates the physiological and molecular outcome of loss-of-function of EPRS1 in vivo and provides valuable insights into the potential side effects on CMs resulting from the EPRS1-targeting therapeutic approach.",

    "abstract": "Cooperation is widespread and arguably a pivotal evolutionary force in maintaining animal societies. Yet, proximately, what underlying motivators drive individuals to cooperate remains relatively unclear. Since  free-riders can exploit the benefits by cheating, selecting the right partner is paramount. Such decision rules need not be based on complex calculations and can be driven by cognitively less-demanding mechanisms, like social relationships (e.g., kinship, non-kin friendships, dyadic tolerance), social status (e.g., dominance hierarchies) and personalities (social and non-social traits); however, holistic evidence related to those mechanisms is scarce. Using the classical  loose-string paradigm, we tested cooperative tendencies of a hierarchical primate, the long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis). We studied three groups (n=32) in social settings, allowing free partner choice. We supplemented cooperation with observational and experimental data on social relationships, dominance hierarchies, and personality. Friendship and dissimilarity in a non-social  exploration personality trait predicted the likelihood of cooperative dyad formation. Furthermore, the magnitude of cooperative success was positively associated with friendship, low rank-distance, and dissimilarity in an  activity-sociability personality trait. Kinship did not affect cooperation. While some findings align with prior studies, the evidence of (non-social)personality heterophily promoting cooperation may deepen our understanding of the proximate mechanisms and, broadly, the evolution of cooperation.",

Due to the imprecise characterization and significant variation among the currently available maturation protocols, it is essential to establish a set of criteria to standardize models and accurately characterize and define the developmental properties of neurons derived from iPSCs.\n\nIn this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the h-iPSC-Ns via electrophysiological and microscopic techniques to follow their functional development at the cellular and network levels. This enabled us to provide a thorough description of the maturation process of h-iPSC-Ns over a 10-week period in vitro. Specifically, we have used conventional whole-cell patch-clamp and dynamic clamp techniques, alongside morphometry, to assess the characteristics of maturing h-iPSC-Ns. Additionally, we utilized calcium imaging to monitor the progression of synaptic activity and network communication. At the single cell level, human neurons exhibited gradually decreasing membrane resistance in parallel with improved excitability by 5 weeks of maturation. Their firing profiles were consistent with those of mature regular firing type of neurons. At the network level we observed the development of abundant fast glutamatergic and depolarizing GABAergic synaptic connections together with synchronized network activity. The identified sequence of differentiation events are consistent and offers a robust framework for developing targeted experiments at varying stages of neuronal maturation. This framework allows for the use of different, age-related methodologies or a singular set of experiments for a cultures maturation.",

    "abstract": "People usually reach for objects to place them in some position and orientation, but the placement component of this sequence is often ignored. For example, reaches are influenced by gaze position, visual feedback, and memory delays, but their influence on object placement is unclear. Here, we tested these factors in a task where participants placed and oriented a trapezoidal block against 2D visual templates displayed on a frontally located computer screen. In Experiment 1, participants matched the block to three possible orientations: 0{degrees} (horizontal), +45{degrees} and -45{degrees}, with gaze fixated 10{degrees} to the left/right. The hand and template either remained illuminated (closed-loop), or visual feedback was removed (open-loop). In Experiment 2, a memory delay was added, and participants sometimes performed saccades (centripetal, centrifugal, or opposite side). In Experiment 1, the hand consistently overshot the template relative to gaze (similar to reaching), especially in the open-loop task. After a memory delay, location errors were influenced by both template orientation and gaze position. Based on previous reach experiments, we expected these errors to be independent of the previous eye position, but placement overshoot also depended on previous saccade metrics. Hand orientation over-rotated relative to template orientation (all conditions). Orientation was influenced by gaze position in Experiment 1, but this vanished in the presence of a memory delay. These results demonstrate interactions between gaze, location, and orientation signals in the planning and execution of hand placement and suggest different neural mechanisms for closed-loop, open-loop, and memory delay placement.\n\nNEW & NOTEWORTHYEye-hand coordination studies usually focus on object acquisition, but placement is equally important. Here, we investigated how gaze position influences object placement toward a 2D template, with different levels of visual feedback. Like reach, placement overestimated goal location relative to gaze, but was also influenced by previous saccade metrics. Gaze also modulated hand orientation, which generally overestimated template orientation. Gaze influence was feedback-dependent, with location errors increasing but orientation errors decreasing after a memory delay.",

Here, we explore a framework that allow for straightforward definition and estimation of such models. We present an expectation-maximization algorithm for tuning hyperparameters that control shrinkage of groups of weights. We highlight properties, limitations, and potential use-cases of the model using simulated data. Next, we explore the model in the context of a BOLD fMRI encoding analysis and an EEG decoding analysis. Finally, we discuss cases where the model can be useful and scenarios where regularization procedures complicate model interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Muscle synergy analyses are used to increase our understanding of motor control. Spatially fixed synergy vectors coordinate multiple co-active muscles through activation commands, known as activation coefficients. To better understand motor learning, it is crucial to know how synergy recruitment varies during a learning task and different levels of movement proficiency. Within one session participants walked on a line, a beam, and learned to walk on a tightrope - tasks that represent different levels of proficiency. Muscle synergies were extracted over all conditions and the number of synergies was determined through the knee-point of the total variance accounted for (tVAF) curve. We found that the tVAF of one synergy decreased with task proficiency (line < beam < tightrope). Additionally, trial-to-trial similarity and distinctness of synergy activation coefficients increased with proficiency and after a learning process. We conclude that precise adjustment and refinement of synergy activation coefficients play a crucial role in motor learning.",

    "abstract": "Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS or taVNS) is a non-invasive method of electrical stimulation of the afferent branch of the vagus nerve, suggested to drive changes in putative physiological markers of noradrenergic activity, including pupil dilation. However, it is unknown whether taVNS can map onto the phasic and tonic modes of noradrenergic activity. The effects of taVNS on pupil dilation in humans are inconsistent, largely due to differences in stimulation protocols. Here, we addressed these issues by investigating pupil dilation under phasic (1 s) and tonic (30 s) stimulation, in a single-blind, sham-controlled, within-subject cross-over design, in the absence of a behavioural task. Phasic taVNS induced a rapid increase in pupil size over baseline, significantly greater than under sham stimulation, which rapidly declined after stimulation offset. The 30 s tonic taVNS induced a similarly rapid (and larger than sham) increase in pupil size over baseline, returning to baseline within 5 s, despite the ongoing stimulation. Thus, both active and sham tonic modes closely resembled the phasic effect. There were no differences in tonic baseline pupil size, and no sustained effects of stimulation on tonic baseline pupil size. This suggests that both phasic- and tonic-like taVNS under the standard stimulation parameters may modulate the noradrenergic system in the phasic mode only, as indexed by evoked pupil dilation, over and above somatosensory effects. This result sheds light on the temporal profile of phasic and tonic stimulation, with implications for their applicability in further research.",

The underlying causes of immune dysfunction in advanced liver disease, whether pathogen or host-mediated, remain unclear. We reported lasting generalized CD8+ T cell hyperfunction in individuals with advanced liver fibrosis in chronic HCV infection. The separation of viral and fibrosis-driven effects or the association of this phenomenon with clinical outcomes of advanced liver fibrosis remains to be determined. Here, a hepatotoxic murine model of liver fibrosis was used to decouple liver fibrosis from viral infection. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-treated mice presented progressive liver fibrosis within {approx}12 weeks, resulting in severe diffuse fibrosis, focal necrosis and surrounding mixed inflammation; pathology similar to that of chronic HCV infection. Taking advantage of this model, we investigated if liver fibrosis caused systemic CD8+ T cell hyperfunction and evaluated its impact on host immune response. At peak liver fibrosis, circulating CD8+ T cells presented increased expression of IFN-{gamma} and granzyme B (GrzB) in comparison to control animals. CD8+ T cell hyperfunction arose by 8 weeks of CCl4 treatment and was sustained with continued liver insult. As a result, fibrotic mice were unable to resist an ectopic tumour challenge and were less responsive to immunotherapy. Furthermore, CD8+ T cell dysfunction was observed in other contexts of chronic liver insult such as high fat diet-induced liver steatosis, even in the absence of significant fibrosis. Collectively, this study shows the impact of chronic liver insult on systemic CD8+ T cell function and its association with impaired immune response, such as tumour surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic responses in bacteria are highly dynamic and heterogeneous, with sudden exposure of bacterial colonies to high drug doses resulting in the coexistence of recovered and arrested cells. The dynamics of the response is determined by regulatory circuits controlling the expression of resistance genes, which are in turn modulated by the drugs action on cell growth and metabolism. Despite advances in understanding gene regulation at the molecular level, we still lack a framework to describe how feedback mechanisms resulting from the interdependence between expression of resistance and cell metabolism can amplify naturally occurring noise and create heterogeneity at the population level. To understand how this interplay affects cell survival upon exposure, we constructed a mathematical model of the dynamics of antibiotic responses that links metabolism and regulation of gene expression, based on the tetracycline resistance tet operon in E. coli. We use this model to interpret measurements of growth and expression of resistance in microfluidic experiments, both in single cells and in biofilms. We also implemented a stochastic model of the drug response, to show that exposure to high drug levels results in large variations of recovery times and heterogeneity at the population level. We show that stochasticity is important to determine how nutrient quality affects cell survival during exposure to high drug concentrations. A quantitative description of how microbes respond to antibiotics in dynamical environments is crucial to understand population-level behaviors such as biofilms and pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is a promising cancer therapy; however, resistance often develops. To learn more about ICB resistance mechanisms, we developed IRIS (Immunotherapy Resistance cell-cell Interaction Scanner), a machine learning model aimed at identifying candidate ligand-receptor interactions (LRI) that are likely to mediate ICB resistance in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We developed and applied IRIS to identify resistance-mediating cell-type-specific ligand-receptor interactions by analyzing deconvolved transcriptomics data of the five largest melanoma ICB therapy cohorts. This analysis identifies a set of specific ligand-receptor pairs that are deactivated as tumors develop resistance, which we refer to as resistance deactivated interactions (RDI). Quite strikingly, the activity of these RDIs in pre-treatment samples offers a markedly stronger predictive signal for ICB therapy response compared to those that are activated as tumors develop resistance. Their predictive accuracy surpasses the state-of-the-art published transcriptomics biomarker signatures across an array of melanoma ICB datasets. Many of these RDIs are involved in chemokine signaling. Indeed, we further validate on an independent large melanoma patient cohort that their activity is associated with CD8+ T cell infiltration and enriched in hot/brisk tumors. Taken together, this study presents a new strongly predictive ICB response biomarker signature, showing that following ICB treatment resistant tumors turn inhibit lymphocyte infiltration by deactivating specific key ligand-receptor interactions.",

RNA polymerase II (Pol II) synthesizes eukaryotic pre-mRNAs from a DNA template strand buried in its active site. Structural details of catalysis at near atomic resolution and precise arrangement of key active site components have been elusive. Here we present the free electron laser (FEL) structure of a matched ATP-bound Pol II, revealing the full active site interaction network at the highest resolution to date, including the trigger loop (TL) in the closed conformation, bonafide occupancy of both site A and B Mg2+, and a putative third (site C) Mg2+ analogous to that described for some DNA polymerases but not observed previously for cellular RNA polymerases. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the structure indicate that the third Mg2+ is coordinated and stabilized at its observed position. TL residues provide half of the substrate binding pocket while multiple TL/bridge helix (BH) interactions induce conformational changes that could propel translocation upon substrate hydrolysis. Consistent with TL/BH communication, a FEL structure and MD simulations of the hyperactive Rpb1 T834P bridge helix mutant reveals rearrangement of some active site interactions supporting potential plasticity in active site function and long-distance effects on both the width of the central channel and TL conformation, likely underlying its increased elongation rate at the expense of fidelity.",

We FACS sorted esophageal basal cells based upon fluorescence of the autophagic vesicle (AV)-identifying dye Cyto-ID, then subjected these cells to transmission electron microscopy, image flow cytometry, 3D organoid assays, RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq), and cell cycle analysis. 3D organoids were subjected to passaging, single cell (sc) RNA-Seq, cell cycle analysis, and immunostaining.\n\nResultsGenetic autophagy inhibition in squamous epithelium resulted in increased proliferation of esophageal basal cells. Esophageal basal cells with high AV level (Cyto-IDHigh) displayed limited organoid formation capability upon initial plating but passaged more efficiently than their counterparts with low AV level (Cyto-IDLow). RNA-Seq suggested increased autophagy in Cyto- IDHigh esophageal basal cells along with decreased cell cycle progression, the latter of which was confirmed by cell cycle analysis. scRNA-Seq of 3D organoids generated by Cyto-IDLow and Cyto- IDHigh cells identified expansion of 3 cell populations, enrichment of G2/M-associated genes, and aberrant localization of cell cycle-associated genes beyond basal cell populations in the Cyto- IDHigh group. Ki67 expression was also increased in organoids generated by Cyto-IDHigh cells, including in cells beyond the basal cell layer. Squamous epithelial-specific autophagy inhibition induced significant weight loss in mice treated with 4NQO that further displayed perturbed epithelial tissue architecture.\n\nConclusionsHigh AV level identifies esophageal epithelium with limited proliferation and enhanced self-renewal capacity that contributes to maintenance of the esophageal proliferation- differentiation gradient in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Chewing with the mandibles is a food processing behavior observed in most current insect lineages. Mandible morphology has an essential role in biting behavior and food processing capacity. However, the mandible cuticle can have regional differences in its mechanical properties, associated or not with the accumulation of elements that increase cuticle stiffness. The effects of such a heterogeneous distribution of cuticle material properties in the mandible responses to biting loading are still poorly explored in chewing insects. Here we measured the elemental composition and material properties of workers of an ant species, Formica cunicularia, and tested the effects of the cuticular variation in Youngs modulus (E) under bite-loading with Finite Element Analysis (FEA). We divided worker mandibles into four regions that we expect would vary in elemental composition and material properties, namely the masticatory margin, mandible blade, ventral (VMA), and dorsal (DMA) mandibular articulations with the head. Specifically, we expect the masticatory margin will show higher cuticular hardness (H) and E values, followed by the mandibular joints and the mandible blade. We also predict that such cuticle material properties variation is functionally relevant under bite-loading, changing stress patterns when compared to the mechanical responses of a mandible with a homogeneous distribution of material properties. To measure elemental composition, we used energy disperse X-ray spectroscopy, while H and E were accessed through nanoindentation tests. Mandible mechanical responses to bite-loading were tested with FEA, comparing a mandible with a homogeneous versus a heterogeneous E distribution. As expected, the mandibular regions showed distinct proportions of relevant elements, like Cu and Zn, with the masticatory margin showing the higher levels of those elements, followed by the mandibular articulations with the head and the mandible blade. The same pattern was observed regarding the values of cuticle H and E. When incorporated into FEA, this variation in E effectively changed mandible stress patterns, leading to a higher concentration of stresses in the stiffer mandibular regions, letting the softer mandible blade with relatively lower stress levels. Our results demonstrated the relevance of cuticle heterogeneity in mechanical properties to deal with bite-loading demands and suggest that the accumulation of transition metals such as Cu and Zn has a relevant correlation with such mechanical characteristics of the mandible in this ant species.",

The poor functional characterization of most NLRP3 variants is a barrier to diagnosis although patients can be efficiently treated with anti-IL-1 approaches. In addition, while NLRP3 inflammasome is controlled by coordinated priming and activation signals, gain-of-functions of NLRP3 variants have been only investigated in response to priming. Here, we functionally characterize 34 NLRP3 variants in vitro by determining their activity in response to induction, priming and/or activation signals, and their sensitivity to inhibitors. We highlight the functional diversity of the gain-of-function mutants and describe four groups based on their profile of signals required for their activation, that correlate partly with the symptoms severities. We identify a new group of NLRP3 mutants responding to the activation signal without priming, with patients often misdiagnosed. Our results identify key NLRP3 residues controlling the inflammasome activity and sensitivity to inhibitors. The comparison of four inhibitors on the 34 variants identifies inhibitory mechanisms with broader efficiency for future drug design. Altogether, our results provide new insights on NLRP3 activation and an explanatory mechanism for NLRP3-AID heterogeneity, and original tools for NLRP3-AID diagnosis and anti-inflammatory disease drug development.\n\neTOC SummaryFunctional characterization of 34 CAPS-associated NLRP3 variants identifies polymorphisms versus gain-of-function pathogenic mutants, and highlights diversities in the signals controlling their activation and in their sensitivity to inhibitors.

Examination of AM from SFB-colonized mice revealed that they were intrinsically altered to resist IAV-induced depletion and inflammatory signaling. Yet, AM from SFB-colonized mice were not quiescent.

    "abstract": "Large-genome bacteriophages (jumbo phages) of the Chimalliviridae family assemble a nucleus-like compartment bounded by a protein shell that protects the replicating phage genome from host-encoded restriction enzymes and CRISPR/Cas nucleases. While the nuclear shell provides broad protection against host nucleases, it necessitates transport of mRNA out of the nucleus-like compartment for translation by host ribosomes, and transport of specific proteins into the nucleus-like compartment to support DNA replication and mRNA transcription. Here we identify a conserved phage nuclear shell-associated protein that we term Chimallin C (ChmC), which adopts a nucleic acid-binding fold, binds RNA with high affinity in vitro, and binds phage mRNAs in infected cells. ChmC also forms phase-separated condensates with RNA in vitro. Targeted knockdown of ChmC using mRNA-targeting dCas13d halts infections at an early stage. Taken together, our data suggest that the conserved ChmC protein acts as a chaperone for phage mRNAs, potentially stabilizing these mRNAs and driving their translocation through the nuclear shell to promote translation and infection progression.",

    "abstract": "Diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) are used by bacteria, archaea and viruses as a targeted mutagenesis tool. Through error-prone reverse transcription, DGRs introduce random mutations at specific genomic loci, enabling rapid evolution of these targeted genes. However, the function and benefits of DGR-diversified proteins in cellular hosts remains elusive. We find that 85% of DGRs from one of the major monophyletic lineages of DGR reverse transcriptases are encoded by multicellular bacteria, which often have two or more DGR loci in their genomes. Using the multicellular purple sulfur bacterium Thiohalocapsa sp. PB-PSB1 as an example, we characterized nine distinct DGR loci that cumulatively lead to more than 10294 possible different combinations of target polypeptides. With environmental metagenomes from individual Thiohalocapsa aggregates, we show that most of PB-PSB1s DGR targets are diversified across its biogeographic range, with spatial heterogeneity in the diversity of each locus. In PSB1 and other members of this lineage of cellular DGRs, diversified target genes are associated with NACHT-domain anti-phage defenses and putative ternary conflict systems previously shown to be enriched in multicellular bacteria. We propose that these DGR-diversified target genes act as antigen sensors that confer a form of adaptive immunity to their multicellular consortia. These findings have implications for the emergence of multicellularity, as the NACHT-domain anti-phage systems and ternary systems share both domain homology and conceptual similarities with the innate immune and programmed cell death pathways of plants and metazoans.\n\nSignificanceTo defend themselves against predators, bacteria employ a wide range of conflict systems, some of which are enriched in multicellular bacteria. Here, we show that numerous multicellular bacteria use related diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) to diversify such conflict systems. Error-prone reverse transcription in DGRs introduces random, targeted mutations and rapid diversification. We used Thiohalocapsa PB-PSB1, a member of multicellular bacterial consortia, as a model to study this association between conflict systems and DGRs. We characterized the natural diversity of PB-PSB1 DGRs and propose they function as hypervariable antigen sensors. The accumulation of such DGR-diversified defense systems in multicellular bacteria emphasizes the fitness advantage of a rapidly diversifying immune system for the evolution of multicellularity.",

    "abstract": "Diseases caused by parasitic flatworms impart a considerable healthcare burden worldwide. Many of these diseases - for example, the parasitic blood fluke infection, schistosomiasis - are treated with the drug praziquantel (PZQ). However, PZQ is ineffective against disease caused by liver flukes from the genus Fasciola. This is due to a single amino acid change within the target of PZQ, a transient receptor potential ion channel (TRPMPZQ), in Fasciola species. Here we identify benzamidoquinazolinone analogs that are active against Fasciola TRPMPZQ. Structure-activity studies define an optimized ligand (BZQ) that caused protracted paralysis and damage to the protective tegument of these liver flukes. BZQ also retained activity against Schistosoma mansoni comparable to PZQ and was active against TRPMPZQ orthologs in all profiled species of parasitic fluke. This broad spectrum activity was manifest as BZQ adopts a pose within the binding pocket of TRPMPZQ dependent on a ubiquitously conserved residue. BZQ therefore acts as a universal activator of trematode TRPMPZQ and a first-in-class, broad spectrum flukicide.",

    "abstract": "In addition to its role in genome protection, DNA methylation can regulate gene expression. In this study, we characterized the impact of acidity, phase variation, and the ArsRS TCS on the expression of the Type I m6A DNA methyltransferase HsdM1 (HP0463) of Helicobacter pylori 26695 and their subsequent effects on the methylome. Transcription of hsdM1 increases at least 4-fold in the absence of the sensory histidine kinase ArsS, the major acid-sensing protein of H. pylori. hsdM1 exists in the phase-variable operon hsdR1-hsdM1. Phase-locking hsdR1 (HP0464), the restriction endonuclease gene, has significant impacts on the transcription of hsdM1. To determine the impacts of methyltransferase transcription patterns on the methylome, we conducted methylome sequencing on samples cultured at pH 7 or pH 5. We found differentially methylated motifs between these growth conditions, and that deletions of arsS and/or hsdM1 interfere with the epigenetic acid response. Deletion of arsS leads to altered activity of HsdM1 and multiple other methyltransferases under both pH conditions indicating that the ArsRS TCS, in addition to direct effects on regulon transcription during acid acclimation, may also indirectly impact gene expression via regulation of the methylome. We determined the target motif of HsdM1 (HP0463) to be the complementary bipartite sequence pair 5-(HH)TCAm6AVN6TGY-3 and 3-AGTN6GAm6ACA-5. The Type II m5C DNA methyltransferase M.HpyAVIII (HP1121) is regulated by ArsS and HsdM1. This complex regulation of DNA methyltransferases, and thus differential methylation patterns, may have implications for the decades-long persistent infection by H. pylori.\n\nImportanceThis study expands the possibilities for complex, epigenomic regulation in Helicobacter pylori. We demonstrate that the H. pylori methylome is plastic and acid-sensitive via the two-component system ArsRS and the DNA methyltransferase HsdM1. The control of a methyltransferase by ArsRS may allow for a layered response to changing acidity. Likely, an early response whereby ArsR[~]P affects regulon expression, including the methyltransferase hsdM1. Then, a somewhat later effect as the altered methylome, due to altered HsdM1 expression, subsequently alters the expression of other genes involved in acclimation. The intermediate methylation of certain motifs supports the hypothesis that methyltransferases play a regulatory role. Untangling this additional web of regulation could play a key role in understanding H. pylori colonization and persistence.",

    "abstract": "Like all other viruses, poxviruses rely on host cells to provide metabolites and energy. Vaccinia virus (VACV), the prototype poxvirus, induces profound metabolic alterations in host cells. We previously showed that VACV infection increases the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, including citrate, that can be transported to the cytosol to be converted to acetyl-CoA for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is a pivotal enzyme converting citrate to acetyl-CoA. Here, we report that VACV infection stimulates the S455 phosphorylation of ACLY, a post-translational modification that stimulates ACLY activity. We demonstrate that the chemical and genetic inhibition of ACLY severely suppresses VACV replication. Remarkably, we found that virus growth factor (VGF)-induced signaling is essential for the VACV-mediated upregulation of ACLY phosphorylation. Furthermore, the upregulation of ACLY phosphorylation during VACV infection is dependent on the activation of the cellular Akt kinase that phosphorylates ACLY. Finally, we report that VGF-induced ACLY phosphorylation via the EGFR-Akt pathway is important for VACV stimulations of neutral lipid droplet synthesis. These findings identified a previously unknown way of rewiring cell metabolism by a virus and a novel function for VGF in the governance of virus-host interactions through the induction of a key enzyme at the crossroads of the TCA cycle and fatty acid de novo biosynthesis. Our study also provides a mechanism for the role played by VGF and its downstream signaling cascades in the modulation of lipid metabolism in VACV-infected cells.\n\nImportanceATP citrate lyase is a key metabolic enzyme that sits at the crossroads of glucose, glutamine, and lipid metabolism. However, how virus infection affects this protein is unclear. Using chemical, genetic, and metabolic approaches we show that VACV, the prototype poxvirus, increases the phosphorylation of ACLY in primary human fibroblasts in a VGF-dependent manner. We further show that the VGF-EGFR-Akt signaling pathway is vital for VACV-induced lipid droplet synthesis. Our findings identified ACLY as a potential target for novel antiviral development against pathogenic poxviruses. Our study also expands the role of growth factor signaling in boosting VACV replication by targeting multiple metabolic pathways.",

While recent advances in high-throughput long-read sequencing provide the potential to greatly increase the phylogenetic coverage of these databases, the performance of different sequencing technologies and subsequent bioinformatics processing remain to be evaluated, primarily because of the absence of well-defined eukaryotic mock communities. To address this challenge, we created a eukaryotic rRNA operons clone-library and turned it into a precisely defined synthetic eukaryotic mock community. This mock community was then used to evaluate the performance of three long-read sequencing techniques (PacBio HiFi, and Nanopore UMI with/without clonal pre-amplification) and three tools for resolving amplicons sequence variants (ASVs) (Uchime3, Unoise3, and DADA2). We investigated the sensitivity of the sequencing techniques based on the number of detected mock taxa, and the accuracy of the different ASV-calling tools with a specific focus on the presence of chimera among the final rRNA operon ASVs. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations and best practice protocols for how to cost-effectively obtain essential error-free rRNA operons in high-throughput.

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a leading cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea, which often stem from disruption of the gut microbiota by broad-spectrum antibiotics. The increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant C. difficile strains, combined with disappointing clinical trials results for recent antibiotic candidates, underscore the urgent need for novel CDI antibiotics. To this end, we investigated C. difficile enoyl ACP reductase (CdFabK), a crucial enzyme in de novo fatty acid synthesis, as a drug target for microbiome-sparing antibiotics. To test this concept, we evaluated the efficacy and in vivo spectrum of activity of the phenylimidazole analog 296, which is validated to inhibit intracellular CdFabK. Against major CDI-associated ribotypes 296 had an MIC90 of 2 {micro}g/ml, which was comparable to vancomycin (1 {micro}g/ml), a standard of care antibiotic. In addition, 296 achieved high colonic concentrations and displayed dosed-dependent efficacy in mice with colitis CDI. Mice that were given 296 retained colonization resistance to C. difficile and had microbiomes that resembled the untreated mice. Conversely, both vancomycin and fidaxomicin induced significant changes to mice microbiomes, in a manner consistent with prior reports. CdFabK therefore represents a potential target for microbiome-sparing CDI antibiotics, with phenylimidazoles providing a good chemical starting point for designing such agents.",

    "abstract": "Magnaporthe oryzae is placed first on a list of the worlds top ten plant pathogens with the highest scientific and economic importance. The pathogen is highly evolved to sense environmental changes quickly to invade different tissues of its host plant successfully. Here, we found alternative splicing (AS) as a previously unknown mechanism of how the pathogen may handle rapidly changing situations during in planta growth. The AS facilitates the production of multiple mRNAs and, consequently, protein isoforms with distinct biological functions from a single gene. The locus MGG_07173 occurs only once in the genome of M. oryzae and encodes the phosphotransfer protein MoYpd1p, which plays an important role in the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signaling pathway for osmoregulation. Originating from this locus, at least three MoYPD1 isoforms are produced in a signal-specific manner. The transcript levels of these MoYPD1-isoforms were individually affected by external stress, which is equally present in host plant tissues. Potassium salt (KCI) stress raised MoYPD1_T0 and MoYPD1_T2 abundance, whereas osmotic stress by sorbitol elevates MoYPD1_T1 levels. In line with this, signal-specific nuclear translocation of green fluorescent protein-fused MoYpd1p isoforms in response to stress was observed. The protein isoforms MoYpd1p_T0 and MoYpd1p_T2 were detected in the nucleus following KCl treatment, whereas MoYpd1p_T1 did likewise upon sorbitol stress. Mutant strains that produce only one of the MoYpd1p isoforms are less virulent, suggesting a combination thereof is required to invade the host successfully. Using in silico protein-protein interaction studies, we were able to assign different roles to respective isoforms in the HOG signaling pathway and predicted interactions with other signaling pathways. In summary, we demonstrate the signal-specific production of MoYpd1p isoforms that individually increase signal diversity and orchestrate virulence in the rice blast fungus M. oryzae.\n\nAuthors summaryThe worlds population rises rapidly and a major problem is the global food security. Magnaporthe oryzae is placed first on a list of the worlds top ten plant pathogens with the highest scientific and economic importance since it causes blast, the most devastating disease of cultivated rice, which is the major food source for more than half of the world population. In this study, we demonstrate signal-specific production of a signaling protein, MoYpd1p, and show for the first time that the isoforms individually increase signal diversity and orchestrate virulence in the rice blast fungus M. oryzae. These results will help to better understand the molecular basis of pathogenicity of the rice blast fungus and consequently open the door to develop new strategies for plant protection and food security. In addition, our study is a valuable contribution to the basic research area of signaling mechanisms in in filamentous pathogenic fungi, and will thus be of high interest for a broad readership of the scientific community.",

    "abstract": "During the UK 2020-2021 epizootic of H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4b high-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs), high mortality occurred during incursions in commercially farmed common pheasants (Phasianus colchicus). Two pheasant farms, affected separately by H5N8 and H5N1 subtypes, included adjacently housed red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa), which appeared to be unaffected. Despite extensive ongoing epizootics, H5Nx HPAIV partridge outbreaks were not reported during 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 in the UK, so it is postulated that partridges are more resistant to HPAIV infection than other gamebirds. To assess this, pathogenesis and both intra- and inter-species transmission of UK pheasant-origin H5N8-2021 and H5N1-2021 HPAIVs were investigated. Onward transmission to chickens was also assessed to better understand the risk of spread from gamebirds to other commercial poultry sectors. A lower infectious dose was required to infect pheasants with H5N8-2021 compared to H5N1-2021. However, HPAIV systemic dissemination to multiple organs within pheasants was more rapid following infection with H5N1-2021 than H5N8-2021, with the former attaining generally higher viral RNA levels in tissues. Intraspecies transmission to contact pheasants was successful for both viruses and associated with viral environmental contamination, while interspecies transmission to a first chicken-contact group was also efficient. However, further onward transmission to additional chicken contacts was only achieved with H5N1-2021. Intra-partridge transmission was only successful when high-dose H5N1-2021 was administered, while partridges inoculated with H5N8-2021 failed to shed and transmit, although extensive tissue tropism was observed for both viruses. Mortalities among infected partridges featured a longer incubation period compared to that in pheasants, for both viruses. Therefore, the susceptibility of different gamebird species and pathogenicity outcomes to the ongoing H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4b HPAIVs varies, but pheasants represent a greater likelihood of H5Nx HPAIV introduction into galliforme poultry settings. Consequently, viral maintenance within gamebird populations and risks to poultry species warrant enhanced investigation.",

More than 80% of patients with Dravet syndrome exhibit a haploinsufficiency in SCN1A, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium ion channel NaV1.1. The epilepsy is believed be caused by specific deficit of SCN1A in inhibitory interneurons of the hippocampus. However, the aetiology of other symptoms including gait disturbances, ataxia, cardiac issues and dysautonomia is less clear.\n\nMethodsIn an Scn1a knock-out (Scn1a-/-) mouse model which recapitulates clinical phenotypes, we assessed NaV1.1 and neuroinflammation throughout the central nervous system.\n\nResultsConsistent with current understanding, wild-type expression of NaV1.1 transcript and protein were absent in knock-out mice in the prefrontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum. Increased GFAP was detected in the brain only in the hippocampus. Transcript and protein were detected in wild-type cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord but not in knock-out mice. Unexpectedly, GFAP was increased in all three spinal regions. Therefore, we proceeded to perform transcriptomic analysis of cortex, hippocampus and spinal cord. Pathways associated with monooxygenase activity, fatty acid ligases and lactate transporters were highly dysregulated in the spinal cord.\n\nConclusionThe existence and relevance of pathology of the spinal cord in Dravet syndrome has received scant attention. Our findings are consistent with some systemic symptoms of Dravet syndrome, with the benefits of treatments which may modulate the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle such as Stiripentol and ketogenic dietary regimes, and with the efficacy of intrathecal delivery of therapeutics.\n\nKey PointsO_LIDecrease of endogenous Scn1a and NaV1.1 expression in Scn1a-/- mice has a widespread impact on the gene expression profile in the spinal cord.\nC_LIO_LIIncreased GFAP expression observed in the spinal cord of Scn1a-/- mice.\nC_LIO_LIDifferentially expressed genes related to monooxygenase activity, fatty acid ligases and lactate transporters in cervical spinal cord of Scn1a-/- mice.\nC_LI",

When we further examined the relationship between transcription, translation and mRNA stability, a bidirectional regulation of RNA stability was revealed, wherein mRNA stability could either exert the buffering effect on gene products or change in a same direction as transcription. Motif analysis unveiled SAMD4A as a major regulator of the dynamic changes in mRNA stability observed during differentiation. Knockdown of SAMD4A impaired neuronal differentiation and influenced the response to oxidative stress. Mechanistically, SAMD4A was found to alter the stability of several mRNAs to which it binds. Meanwhile, a dimorphic pattern of the correlation between gene expression and SAMD4A-regulated mRNA stability was observed, suggesting dynamic regulation mRNA stability during the neuronal differentiation guided by SAMD4A. The novel insights into the interplay between mRNA stability and cellular behaviors provide a foundation for understanding neurodevelopmental processes and neurodegenerative disorders and highlights dynamic mRNA stability as an important layer of gene expression regulation.",

    "abstract": "It is hypothesized that impaired endometrial decidualization contributes to decreased fertility in individuals with endometriosis. To identify the molecular defects that underpin defective decidualization in endometriosis, we subjected endometrial stromal cells from individuals with or without endometriosis to time course in vitro decidualization with estradiol, progesterone, and 8-bromo-cyclic-AMP (EPC) for 2, 4, 6, or 8 days. Transcriptomic profiling identified differences in key pathways between the two groups, including defective bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD4 signaling (ID2, ID3, FST), oxidate stress response (NFE2L2, ALOX15, SLC40A1), and retinoic acid signaling pathways (RARRES, RARB, ALDH1B1). Genome-wide binding analyses identified an altered genomic distribution of SMAD4 and H3K27Ac in the decidualized stromal cells from individuals without endometriosis relative to those with endometriosis, with target genes enriched in pathways related to signaling by transforming growth factor {beta} (TGF{beta}), neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptors (NTRK), and nerve growth factor (NGF)-stimulated transcription. We found that direct SMAD1/5/4 target genes control FOXO, PI3K/AKT, and progesterone-mediated signaling in decidualizing cells and that BMP2 supplementation in endometriosis patient-derived assembloids elevated the expression of decidualization markers. In summary, transcriptomic and genome-wide binding analyses of patient-derived endometrial cells and assembloids identified that a functional BMP/SMAD1/5/4 signaling program is crucial for engaging decidualization.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic stressors are exacerbating the emergence and spread of pathogens worldwide. In regions like the Arctic where ecosystems are particularly susceptible, marked changes are predicted in regional diversity, intensity, and patterns of infectious diseases. To understand such rapidly changing host-pathogen dynamics and mitigate the impacts of novel pathogens, we need sensitive disease surveillance tools. We developed and validated a novel multiplexed, magnetic-capture and ddPCR tool for the surveillance of multiple pathogens in polar bears, a sentinel species that is considered susceptible to climate change and other stressors with a pan-Arctic distribution. Through sequence-specific magnetic capture, we concentrated five target template sequences from three zoonotic bacteria (Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Francisella tularensis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex) and two parasitic (Toxoplasma gondii and Trichinella spp.) pathogens from large quantities (< 100 g) of host tissue. We then designed and validated two multiplexed probe-based ddPCR assays for the amplification and detection of the low concentration target DNA. Validations used 48 polar bear tissues (muscle and liver). We detected 14, 1, 3, 4, and 22 tissue positives for E. rhusiopathiae, F. tularensis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, T. gondii, and Trichinella spp., respectively. These multiplexed assays offer a rapid, specific tool for quantifying and monitoring the changing geographical and host distributions of pathogens relevant to human and animal health.",

Compared to vertebrate systems, our understanding of the impact of host age on invertebrate-pathogen interactions remains limited. We examined the influence of mosquito age on key life-history traits driving human malaria transmission. Females of Anopheles coluzzii, a major malaria vector, belonging to three age classes (4, 8, and 12 day-old), were experimentally infected with Plasmodium falciparum field isolates. Our findings revealed reduced competence in 12-day-old mosquitoes, characterized by lower oocyst/sporozoite rates and intensities compared to younger mosquitoes. Despite shorter median longevities in older age classes, infected 12-day-old mosquitoes exhibited improved survival, suggesting that the infection might act as a fountain of youth for older mosquitoes specifically. The timing of sporozoite appearance in the salivary glands remained consistent across mosquito age classes, with an extrinsic incubation period of approximately 13 days. Integrating these results into an epidemiological model revealed a lower vectorial capacity for older mosquitoes compared to younger ones, albeit still substantial due to extended longevity in the presence of infection. Considering age heterogeneity provides valuable insights for ecological and epidemiological studies, informing targeted control strategies to mitigate pathogen transmission.",

    "abstract": "SummaryAlgae with a more diverse suite of pigments can, in principle, exploit a broader swath of the light spectrum through chromatic acclimation, the ability to maximize light capture via plasticity of pigment composition. We grew Rhodomonas salina in wide-spectrum, red, green, and blue environments and measured how pigment composition differed. We also measured expression of key light-capture and photosynthesis-related genes and performed a transcriptome- wide expression analysis. We observed the highest concentration of phycoerythrin in green light, consistent with chromatic acclimation. Other pigments showed trends inconsistent with chromatic acclimation, possibly due to feedback loops among pigments or high-energy light acclimation. Expression of some photosynthesis-related genes was sensitive to spectrum, although expression of most was not. The phycoerythrin -subunit was expressed two-orders of magnitude greater than the {beta}-subunit even though the peptides are needed in an equimolar ratio. Expression of genes related to chlorophyll-binding and phycoerythrin concentration were correlated, indicating a potential synthesis relationship. Pigment concentrations and expression of related genes were generally uncorrelated, implying post-transcriptional regulation of pigments. Overall, most differentially expressed genes were not related to photosynthesis; thus, examining associations between light spectrum and other organismal functions, including sexual reproduction and glycolysis, may be important.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementMost work on light and algal photophysiology focuses on light intensity rather than light spectrum. Given the large spectral variation of light in aquatic systems, explaining how such algae respond to spectral variation will provide a better foundation for understanding the base of aquatic food webs. Much of the light spectrum is poorly absorbed by chlorophyll, which creates an opportunity for photosynthetic species with other pigments. We quantified physiological and genetic responses to light spectrum in replicate experimental populations of Rhodomonas salina, an alga with a phycoerythrin in addition to chlorophylls. We predicted photophysiology and gene expression would change to maximize R. salinas capacity to capture available light, in accordance with the theory of chromatic acclimation. Our results show that responses to light spectra are more complex than predicted. Some aspects of photophysiology did support the theorys predictions, but gene expression was generally unrelated to variation of light spectrum or photophysiology. This not only suggests that chromatic acclimation is potentially regulated post-transcriptionally, but also that physiological processes - notably glycolysis and the transition to sexual reproduction - that may be regulated by light spectrum. Our work adds to the generally limited work on light spectrum and physiology by investigating a eukaryote from a phylum with a great diversity of photosynthetic pigments.",

    "abstract": "Repeated population bottlenecks influence the evolution and maintenance of cooperation1,2. However, it remains unclear whether bottlenecks select all cooperative traits expressed by an organism or only a subset of them. Myxococcus xanthus, a social bacterium, displays multiple cooperative traits, including growth, predation, sporulation in multicellular fruiting bodies, and germination 3-6. Using laboratory evolution experiment, we investigated the effect of repeated stringent versus relaxed population bottlenecks on the evolution of these four cooperative traits when they were all under selection. We found that only fruiting body formation and growth were positively selected under the stringent regimen, while the other two traits were negatively selected. The pattern was reversed in the relaxed regimen. Additionally, the relaxed regimen led to a significant increase in fitness when competed against ancestors across the entire lifecycle, whereas the stringent treatment did not change competitive fitness. Genomic analysis revealed that mutations in {sigma}54 interacting protein and DNA-binding response regulator protein are linked with the changes observed in stringent and relaxed regimens respectively. Further, similar trade-offs are also seen among natural populations of M. xanthus. Overall, we demonstrate that different bottleneck sizes drive the evolution of lifecycles in distinct manners, driven by trade-offs between cooperative life history traits.",

The southern stuttering frog is ground-dwelling, inhabiting naturally vegetated riverbanks in south-eastern Australia.

Using this assembly, we identified the mitochondrial genome, and assembled six tissue-specific transcriptomes. We also bioinformatically characterised novel sequences of two families of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the southern stuttering frog, the cathelicidins and {beta}-defensins. While traditional peptidomic approaches to peptide discovery have typically identified one or two AMPs in a frog species from skin secretions, our bioinformatic approach discovered 12 cathelicidins and two {beta}-defensins that were expressed in a range of tissues. We investigated the novelty of the peptides and found diverse predicted activities.

Here we aimed to investigate the role of genetic variation in determining the host transcriptomic response and to delineate regulatory networks underlying SRS. Using genotyping and RNA-seq data on 638 adult sepsis patients, we report 16,049 independent expression (eQTLs) and 32 co-expression module (modQTLs) quantitative trait loci in this disease context. We identified significant interactions between SRS and genotype for 1,578 SNP-gene pairs, and combined transcription factor (TF) binding site information (SNP2TFBS) and predicted regulon activity (DoRothEA) to identify candidate upstream regulators. These included HIF1A and CEBPB, which were associated with progenitor and immature neutrophil subsets respectively, further implicating glycolysis and emergency granulopoiesis in SRS1. Overall, these approaches identified putative mechanistic links between host genetic variation, cell subtypes, and the individual transcriptomic response to infection.

    "abstract": "Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) of human plasma is a biomarker of many cancer diseases, and its N-glycosylation accounts for 60% of molecular mass. It is highly desirable to characterize its glycoforms for providing additional dimension of features to increase its performance in prognosis and diagnosis of cancers. However, to systematically characterize its site-specific glycosylation is challenging due to its low abundance. Here, we developed a highly sensitive strategy for in-depth glycosylation profiling of plasma CEA through chemical proteomics combined with multi-enzymatic digestion. A trifunctional probe was utilized to generate covalent bond of plasma CEA and its antibody upon UV irradiation. As low as 1 ng/mL CEA in plasma could be captured and digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin for intact glycopeptide characterization. Twenty six out of 28 potential N-glycosylation sites were well identified, which were the most comprehensive N-glycosylation site characterization of CEA on intact glycopeptide level as far as we known. Importantly, this strategy was applied to the glycosylation analysis of plasma CEA in cancer patients. Differential site-specific glycoforms of plasma CEA were observed in patients with colorectal carcinomas (CRC) and lung cancer. The distributions of site-specific glycoforms were different as the progression of CRC, and most site-specific glycoforms were overexpressed in stage II of CRC. Overall, we established a highly sensitive chemical proteomic method to profile site-specific glycosylation of plasma CEA, which should generally applicable to other well-established cancer glycoprotein biomarkers for improving their cancer diagnosis and monitoring performance.\n\nIn BriefA chemical proteomic approach for glycosylation profiling of proteins was established for glycosylation characterization of plasma CEA with low abundance.

It reduced the expression of some markers associated with inflammation and oxidative stress and modulated that of subunits of the voltage and Ca2+ activated K+ (BK) channel in the carotid artery one year after irradiation. Treatment with pravastatin for one year completely reversed the changes caused by irradiation.\n\nConclusionsIn mice, short-term administration of pravastatin is sufficient to reduce chronic vascular injury after irradiation. Long-term administration eliminates the effects of irradiation.

The extracellular matrix molecules of Bacillus subtilis are examples of public goods that are produced through the division of labour and support biofilm formation. Another class of public good that supports B. subtilis growth when nutrients are in a polymeric form are extracellular proteases. In this study, we investigated the role of extracellular proteases during B. subtilis biofilm formation. We established that the extracellular proteases support biofilm growth even when the nitrogen source is available as glutamic acid. Reviewing the contribution played by each protease identified that selected individual extracellular proteases have distinct functions, with AprE found to be crucial for development and WprA sufficient for biofilm formation. We found that changing the nutrient source affected biofilm structure, hydrophobicity, and architecture, likely due to the increased cost of protease dependency for growth. Co-culture of biofilm matrix and extracellular protease mutants rescued biofilm structure through public goods sharing, but the dependence on extracellular protease for growth influenced community coexistence. The intricate sharing among these two classes of public goods sheds light on microbial social dynamics during biofilm formation in different ecological contexts.",

    "abstract": "Diet composition plays a large role in regulating of gut health and enteric infection. In particular, synthetic  Western-style diets may predispose to disease, whilst whole-grain diets containing high levels of crude fiber are thought to promote gut health. Here we show that, in contrast to this paradigm, mice fed unrefined chow are significantly more susceptible to infection with Trichuris muris, a caecum-dwelling nematode, than mice given refined, semi-synthetic diets (SSD). Moreover, mice fed SSD supplemented with inulin, a fermentable fiber, developed chronic T. muris burdens whereas mice given SSD efficiently cleared the infection. Diet composition significantly impacted infection-induced changes in the host gut microbiome. Mice infected with the bacterium Citrobacter rodentium were also more susceptible to pathogen colonization when fed either chow or inulin-enriched SSD. However, transcriptomic analysis of tissues from mice fed either SSD or inulin-enriched SSD revealed that, in contrast to T. muris, increased C. rodentium infection appeared to be independent of the host immune response. Accordingly, exogenous treatment with IL-25 partially reduced T. muris burdens in inulin-fed mice, whereas IL-22 treatment was unable to restore resistance to C. rodentium colonization. Diet-mediated effects on pathogen burden were more pronounced for large intestine-dwelling pathogens, as effects on small intestinal helminth (Heligmosomoides polygyrus) were less evident, and protozoan (Giardia muris) infection burdens were equivalent in mice fed chow, inulin-enriched SSD, or SSD, despite higher cyst excretion in chow-fed mice. Collectively, our results point to a tissue- and pathogen-restricted effect of dietary fiber levels on enteric infection intensity.\n\nImportanceEnteric infections induce dysbiosis and inflammation and are a major public health burden. As the gut environment is strongly shaped by diet, the role of different dietary components in promoting resistance to infection is of interest. Whilst diets rich in fiber or whole grain are normally associated with improved gut health, we show here that these components predispose the host to higher levels of pathogen infection. Thus, our results have significance for interpreting how different dietary interventions may impact on gastrointestinal infections. Moreover, our results may shed light on our understanding of how gut flora and musical immune function is influenced by the food that we eat.",

    "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative healthcare-associated pathogen that poses a major health concern due to increasing multidrug resistance. The Gram-negative cell envelope is a key barrier to antimicrobial entry and includes an inner and outer membrane. The outer membrane has an asymmetric composition that is important for structural integrity and barrier to the environment. Therefore, Gram-negative bacteria have mechanisms to uphold this asymmetry such as the maintenance of lipid asymmetry system (Mla), which removes glycerophospholipids from the outer leaflet of the outer membrane and transports them to the inner membrane. Loss of this system in A. baumannii results in attenuated virulence and increased susceptibility to membrane stressors and some antibiotics. We recently reported two strain variants of the A. baumannii type strain ATCC 17978, 17978VU and 17978UN. We show here that {Delta}mlaF mutants in the two strains display different phenotypes for membrane stress resistance, antibiotic resistance, and pathogenicity in a murine pneumonia model. We used comparative genetics to identify interactions between ATCC 17978 strain alleles and mlaF to uncover the cause behind the phenotypic differences. Although allele differences in obgE were previously reported to synergize with {Delta}mlaF to affect growth and stringent response, we show that obgE alleles do not affect membrane stress resistance. Instead, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the essential gene encoding undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (Und-PP) synthase, uppS, synergizes with {Delta}mlaF to increase susceptibility to membrane stress and antibiotics, and reduce persistence in a mouse lung infection. Und-P is a lipid glycan carrier known to be required for biosynthesis of A. baumannii capsule, cell wall, and glycoproteins. Our data suggest that in the absence of the Mla system, the cellular level of Und-P is critical for envelope integrity, antibiotic resistance, and lipooligosaccharide abundance. These findings uncover synergy between Und-P and the Mla system in maintaining the A. baumannii outer membrane and stress resistance.",

Here, we report the surprising detection of multiple mitochondrial-derived transfer RNAs (mito-tRNAs) within the nuclei of human cells. Focused studies of nuclear-transported mito-tRNA-asparagine (mtAsn) revealed that its cognate charging enzyme (NARS2) is also present in the nucleus. MtAsn promoted interaction of NARS2 with histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), and repressed HDAC2 association with specific chromatin loci.

    "abstract": "BackgroundNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is prevalent worldwide and is associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Opisthorchis viverrini (Ov) infection and consumption of high- fat and high-fructose (HFF) diets exacerbate NAFLD leading to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of a combination of HFF diets and O.viverrini infection on kidney pathology via changes in the gut microbiome and host proteome in hamsters.\n\nMethodology/Principal findingsTwenty animals were divided into four groups; Normal diet feeding and non-infected Ov (Normal); HFF diets feeding (HFF); Ov infection (Ov); and feeding with a combination of HFF diets and infection with Ov (HFFOv). Fecal samples were extracted and used for Illumina Miseq sequencing platform based on the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, along with LC/MS-MS analysis. Histopathological studies and biochemical assays were also conducted. The results indicated that the HFFOv group exhibited the most severe kidney injury, as elevated KIM-1 expression and accumulation of fibrosis in kidney tissue. In comparison with the HFF group, the combined group showed higher diversity and composition. An increased number of Ruminococaceae, Lachospiraceae, Desulfovibrionaceae and Akkermansiaceae, and a lower number of Eggerthellaceae were observed. A total of 243 significant host proteome were identified in all groups. Analysis using STITCH predicted that host proteome associated leaky gut such as soluble CD14 and p-cresol may play a role in the development of kidney disease. Among host proteome, TGF-beta, involving in fibrogenesis, was significantly expressed in HFFOv.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThe combination of HFF diets and O.viverrini infection may promote kidney injury through the alterations in the gut microbiome and host proteome. This knowledge may be an effective strategy to prevent the progression of CKD beyond the early stages.\n\nAuthor summaryA diets high in fat and fructose causes nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFD), which is increasing worldwide. Liver fluke (Opisthorchis viverrini, Ov) infection is endemic in the Mekong subregion including in the northeastern Thailand. The prevalence of opisthorchiasis caused by the infection with O. viverrini is associated with fatty liver and bile duct cancer. We have previously demonstrated that infection with O. viverrini exacerbates NAFD progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in animal models. NASH exists kidney disease severity higher than ingestion of high-fat and high-fructose (HFF) diets or infection with O. viverrini. Here, we further investigate whether metagenomics is more likely to change in NASH than in NAFD or opisthorchiasis conditions. The combined group had higher diversity and composition. Elevated levels of Ruminococaceae, Lachospiraceae, Desulfovibrionaceae and Akkermansiaceae and decreased levels of Eggerthellaceae were observed, suggesting that HFF+Ov may cause gut dysbiosis in NASH. Differentially expressed proteins were also associated with these gut microbiomes in NASH condition. In addition, we found that the association of metagenomics and metaproteomics in NASH was related to kidney disease. Analysis using STITCH predicted that host proteome may be involved in leaky gut such as soluble CD14 and p-cresol to promote kidney disease. A significantly expressed TGF-beta involving fibrogenesis was found to be associated with kidney fibrosis. Therefore, alterations of metagenomics and metaproteomics is associated with kidney disease in a combination of opisthorchiasis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.",

    "abstract": "Neural stem cells (NSCs) show high potential in ameliorating the brain damage induced by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) via proliferation, differentiation, and immunomodulation. However, it remains unclear whether NSCs can improve the microvascular function, e.g., blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity after ICH. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic benefit of NSCs on BBB integrity and the underlying mechanism. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham, ICH+PBS and ICH+NSCs groups for comparisons. ICH was induced by intrastriatal injection of bacterial collagenase. An aliquot of NSCs or PBS was injected via the tail vein 2 h after the ICH induction. The following multiparametric measurements were compared: brain edema, hematoma volume, behavioral test, BBB permeability, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway activity. We found that NSCs treatment attenuates BBB permeability, reduces brain edema, and promotes brain function recovery after ICH by inhibiting ERK1/2, p38 and JNK signaling pathway activation. This finding provides a novel insight for future therapies aiming to preventing BBB dysfunction and improve functional recovery in ICH patients.",

    "abstract": "Animal models have historically been poor preclinical predictors of gastrointestinal (GI) directed therapeutic efficacy and drug-induced GI toxicity. Human stem and primary cell-derived culture systems are a major focus of efforts to create biologically relevant models that enhance preclinical predictive value of intestinal efficacy and toxicity. The inherent variability in stem-cell-based complex cultures makes development of useful models a challenge; the stochastic nature of stem-cell differentiation interferes with the ability to build and validate robust, reproducible assays that query drug responses and pharmacokinetics. In this study, we aimed to characterize and reduce potential sources of variability in a complex stem cell-derived intestinal epithelium model, termed RepliGut(R) Planar, across cells from multiple human donors, cell lots, and passage numbers. Assessment criteria included barrier formation and integrity, gene expression, and cytokine responses. Gene expression and culture metric analyses revealed that controlling for stem/progenitor-cell passage number reduces variability and maximizes physiological relevance of the model. After optimizing passage number, donor-specific differences in cytokine responses were observed in a case study, suggesting biologic variability is observable in cell cultures derived from multiple human sources. Our findings highlight key considerations for designing assays that can be applied to additional primary-cell derived systems, as well as establish utility of the RepliGut(R) Planar platform for robust development of human-predictive drug-response assays.",

    "abstract": "Microfibrillar-associated protein 4 (MFAP4) is a 36-kDa extracellular glycoprotein with critical roles in human pathologies, including fibrosis in several organ systems, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular disorders. In elastic tissues such as arteries, lungs, and skin, MFAP4 associates with microfibrils and elastic fibres, which are the central extracellular fibres affected in thoracic aneurysms. MFAP4 directly interacts with elastogenic proteins, including fibrillin-1 and tropoelastin, and with cells via integrins. MFAP4 multimerisation represents a critical hallmark required for its physiological and pathological properties. However, molecular details and functional consequences of MFAP4 multimerisation are lacking.\n\nHere we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of human MFAP4. In the presence of calcium, MFAP4 assembles as an octamer with D2 point group symmetry, where two sets of homodimers constitute the top and bottom halves of each octamer. Each of the homodimers is linked together by an inter-molecular disulfide bond. An engineered C34S missense mutation in MFAP4 prevented disulfide-bond formation between monomers, but the mutant formed octamers similar to wild type MFAP4. The atomic model, built into the 3.55 [A] cryo-EM map, suggests that several salt-bridges are important for interactions within and between homodimers, while non-polar interactions are important for octamer halves to assemble. In the absence of calcium, MFAP4 dissociates into tetramers, representing the top/bottom halves of the octamers. Binding studies with elastogenic proteins, including fibrillin-1, tropoelastin, LTBP4, and small fibulins showed that MFAP4 has multiple surfaces for protein-protein interactions, which depend upon the higher-order assembly of MFAP4. While the disulfide-bond mediated by C34S contributes little to those protein interactions, it modulated cell interaction. When MFAP4 forms assemblies with fibrillin-1, it abrogates MFAP4 interactions with cells. Overall, the study provides detailed molecular structure-function relationships of MFAP4 interactions with elastogenic proteins and cells.",

To generate gametes via meiosis, two distinct and sequential chromosome segregation events occur without an intervening S phase. How canonical cell cycle controls are modified for meiosis is not well understood. Here, using highly synchronous budding yeast populations, we reveal how the global proteome and phosphoproteome changes during the meiotic divisions. While protein abundance changes are limited to key cell cycle regulators, dynamic phosphorylation changes are pervasive. Our data indicate that two waves of cyclin-dependent kinase and Polo (Cdc5Polo) kinase activity drive successive meiotic divisions. These two distinct waves of phosphorylation are ensured by the meiosis-specific Spo13Meikin protein, which rewires the phosphoproteome. Spo13Meikin binds to Cdc5Polo to promote phosphorylation of a subset of substrates in meiosis I containing a newly identified motif, which we define as the Spo13Meikin -Cdc5Polo consensus phosphorylation motif. Overall, our findings reveal that a master regulator of meiosis redirects the activity of a kinase to change the phosphorylation landscape and elicit a developmental cascade.",

Inter-chromosomal (trans) contacts have received much less attention, and tools for interrogating potential biologically relevant trans structures are lacking. Here, we develop a computational framework to identify sets of loci that jointly interact in trans from Hi-C data. This method, trans-C, initiates probabilistic random walks with restarts from a set of seed loci to traverse an input Hi-C contact network, thereby identifying sets of trans-contacting loci. We validate trans-C in three increasingly complex models of established trans contacts: the Plasmodium falciparum var genes, the mouse olfactory receptor \"Greek islands\", and the human RBM20 cardiac splicing factory. We then apply trans-C to systematically test the hypothesis that genes co-regulated by the same trans-acting element (i.e., a transcription or splicing factor) co-localize in three dimensions to form \"RNA factories\" that maximize the efficiency and accuracy of RNA biogenesis. We find that many loci with multiple binding sites of the same transcription factor interact with one another in trans, especially those bound by transcription factors with intrinsically disordered domains. Similarly, clustered binding of a subset of RNA binding proteins correlates with trans interaction of the encoding loci. These findings support the existence of trans interacting chromatin domains (TIDs) driven by RNA biogenesis. Trans-C provides an efficient computational framework for studying these and other types of trans interactions, empowering studies of a poorly understood aspect of genome architecture.",

    "abstract": "Outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) fusion is an important process for the cell and organism survival, as its dysfunction is linked to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. The OMM fusion is mediated by members of the dynamin-related protein (DRP) family, named mitofusins. The exact mechanism by which the mitofusins contribute to these diseases, as well as the exact molecular fusion mechanism mediated by mitofusin, remains elusive.\n\nWe have performed extensive multiscale molecular dynamics simulations using both coarse-grained and all-atom approaches to predict the dimerization of two transmembrane domain (TM) helices of the yeast mitofusin Fzo1. We identify specific residues, such as Lys716, that can modulate dimer stability. Comparison with a previous computational model reveals remarkable differences in helix crossing angles and interfacial contacts. Overall, however, the TM1-TM2 interface appears to be stable in the Martini and CHARMM force fields. Replica-exchange simulations further tune a detailed atomistic model, as confirmed by a remarkable agreement with an independent prediction of the Fzo1-Ugo1 complex by AlphaFold2. Functional implications, including a possible role of Lys716 that could affect membrane interactions during fusion, are suggested and consistent with experiments monitoring mitochondrial respiration of selected Fzo1 mutants.",

    "abstract": "The oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system in mammalian mitochondria plays a key role in harvesting energy from ingested nutrients1, 2. Mitochondrial metabolism is very dynamic and can be reprogrammed to support both catabolic and anabolic reactions, depending on physiological demands or disease states3, 4. Rewiring of mitochondrial metabolism is intricately linked to metabolic diseases5, 6 and is also necessary to promote tumour growth7-11. Here, we demonstrate that per oral treatment with an inhibitor of mitochondrial transcription (IMT)11 shifts whole animal metabolism towards fatty acid oxidation, which, in turn, leads to rapid normalization of body weight, reversal of hepatosteatosis and restoration of glucose tolerance in mice on high-fat diet. Paradoxically, the IMT treatment causes a severe reduction of OXPHOS capacity concomitant with a marked upregulation of fatty acid oxidation in the liver, as determined by proteomics and non-targeted metabolomics analyses. The IMT treatment leads to a marked reduction of complex I, the main dehydrogenase that feeds electrons into the ubiquinone (Q) pool, whereas the levels of electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETF-DH) and other dehydrogenases connected to the Q pool are increased. This rewiring of metabolism caused by reduced mtDNA expression in the liver provides a novel principle for drug treatment of obesity and obesity-related pathology.",

    "abstract": "Duplication 15q (dup15q) syndrome is the most common genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Due to a higher genetic and phenotypic homogeneity compared to idiopathic autism, dup15q syndrome provides a well-defined setting to investigate ASD mechanisms. Previous bulk gene expression studies identified shared molecular changes in ASD. However, how cell type specific changes compare across different autism subtypes and how they change during development is largely unknown. In this study, we used single cell and single nucleus mRNA sequencing of dup15q cortical organoids from patient iPSCs, as well as post-mortem patient brain samples. We find cell-type specific dysregulated programs that underlie dup15q pathogenesis, which we validate by spatial resolved transcriptomics using brain tissue samples. We find degraded identity and vulnerability of deep-layer neurons in fetal stage organoids and highlight increased molecular burden of postmortem upper-layer neurons implicated in synaptic signaling, a finding shared between idiopathic ASD and dup15q syndrome. Gene co-expression network analysis of organoid and postmortem excitatory neurons uncovers modules enriched with autism risk genes. Organoid developmental modules were involved in transcription regulation via chromatin remodeling, while postmortem modules were associated with synaptic transmission and plasticity. The findings reveal a shifting landscape of ASD cellular vulnerability during brain development.",

    "abstract": "Oligodendrocytes are a key cell type within the central nervous system (CNS) that generate the myelin sheath covering axons, enabling fast propagation of neuronal signals. Alcohol consumption is known to affect oligodendrocytes and white matter in the CNS. However, most studies have focused on fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and severe alcohol use disorder. Additionally, the impact of alcohol dosage on oligodendrocytes has not been previously investigated. In this study, we evaluated transcriptomic changes in C57BL6/J cultured mature oligodendrocytes following exposure to moderate and high concentrations of alcohol. We found that high concentrations of alcohol elicited gene expression changes across a wide range of biological pathways, including myelination, protein translation, integrin signaling, cell cycle regulation, and inflammation. Further, our results demonstrate that transcriptomic changes are indeed dependent on alcohol concentration, with moderate and high concentrations of alcohol provoking distinct gene expression profiles. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that alcohol-induced transcriptomic changes in oligodendrocytes are concentration-dependent and may have critical downstream impacts on myelin production. Targeting alcohol-induced changes in cell cycle regulation, integrin signaling, inflammation, or protein translation regulation may uncover mechanisms for modulating myelin production or inhibition. Furthermore, gaining a deeper understanding of alcohols effects on oligodendrocyte demyelination and remyelination could help uncover therapeutic pathways that can be utilized independent of alcohol to aid in remyelinating drug design.",

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a genetically and clinically diverse group of diseases characterized by lysosomal dysfunction. Batten disease is a family of severe LSDs primarily impacting the central nervous system. Here we show that AF38469, a small molecule inhibitor of sortilin, improves lysosomal and glial pathology across multiple LSD models. Live-cell imaging and comparative transcriptomics demonstrates that the transcription factor EB (TFEB), an upstream regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, is activated upon treatment with AF38469. Utilizing CLN2 and CLN3 Batten disease mouse models, we performed a short-term efficacy study and show that treatment with AF38469 prevents the accumulation of lysosomal storage material and the development of neuroinflammation, key disease associated pathologies. Tremor phenotypes, an early behavioral phenotype in the CLN2 disease model, were also completely rescued. These findings reveal sortilin inhibition as a novel and highly efficacious therapeutic modality for the treatment of multiple forms of Batten disease.",

    "abstract": "Organoids and assembloids have emerged as a promising platform to model aspects of nervous system development. Longterm, minimally-invasive recordings in these multi-cellular systems are essential for developing disease models. Current technologies, such as patch-clamp, penetrating microelectrodes, planar electrode arrays and substrate-attached flexible electrodes, do not, however, allow chronic recording of organoids in suspension, which is necessary to preserve their architecture. Inspired by the art of kirigami, we developed flexible electronics that transition from a 2D pattern to a 3D basketlike configuration to accommodate the long-term culture of organoids in suspension. This platform, named kirigami electronics (KiriE), integrates with and enables chronic recording of cortical organoids while preserving morphology, cytoarchitecture, and cell composition. KiriE can be integrated with optogenetic and pharmacological stimulation and model disease. Moreover, KiriE can capture activity in cortico-striatal assembloids. Moving forward, KiriE could reveal disease phenotypes and activity patterns underlying the assembly of the nervous system.",
