    "abstract": "To achieve a stable mass distribution over multiple generations, proliferating cells require some means of counteracting stochastic noise in the rate of growth, the time spent in the cell cycle, and the imprecision of the equality of cell division. In the most widely accepted model, cell size is thought to be regulated at the G1/S transition, such that cells smaller than a critical size pause at the end of G1 phase until they have accumulated mass to a predetermined size threshold, at which point the cells proceed through the rest of the cell cycle. However, a model, based solely on a specific size checkpoint at G1/S, cannot readily explain why cells with deficient G1/S control mechanisms are still able to maintain a very stable cell mass distribution. Furthermore, such a model would not easily account for how stochastic variation in cell mass during the subsequent phases of the cell cycle can be anticipated at G1/S. To address such questions, we applied computationally enhanced Quantitative Phase Microscopy (ceQPM) to populations of proliferating cells, which enables highly accurate measurement of cell dry mass of individual cells throughout the cell cycle. From these measurements we can evaluate the factors that contribute to cell mass homeostasis at any point in the cell cycle. Our findings reveal that cell mass homeostasis is accurately maintained, despite disruptions to the normal G1/S machinery or perturbations in the rate of cell growth. Control of cell mass accumulation is clearly not confined to the G1/S transition but is instead exerted throughout the cell cycle. Using several mammalian cell types, we find that the coefficient of variation in dry mass of cells in the population begins to decline well before the G1/S transition and continues to decline throughout S and G2 phases. Among the different cell types tested, the detailed response of cell growth rate to cell mass differs. However, in general, when it falls below that for exponential growth, the natural increase in the coefficient of variation of cell mass is effectively constrained. We find that both size-dependent cell cycle regulation and size-dependent growth rate modulation contribute to reducing cell mass variation within the population. Through the interplay and coordination of these two processes, accurate cell mass homeostasis emerges. Such findings reveal previously unappreciated and very general principles of cell size control in proliferating cells. These same regulatory processes might also be operative in terminally differentiated cells. Further quantitative dynamical studies should lead to a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of cell size control.",

    "abstract": "The recent recognition of the importance of the microbiome to the hosts health and well-being, has yielded efforts to develop therapies that aim to shift the microbiome from a disease-associated steady-state to a healthier one. Direct manipulation techniques of the species assemblage are currently available, e.g., using probiotics or narrow-spectrum antibiotics to introduce or eliminate specific taxa. However, predicting the species abundances at the new steady-state remains a challenge, mainly due to the difficulties of deciphering the delicate underlying network of ecological interactions or constructing a predictive model for such complex ecosystems. Here, we propose a model-free method to predict the species abundances at the new steady state based on their presence/absence configuration by utilizing a multi-dimensional k-nearest-neighbors (kNN) regression algorithm. By analyzing data from numeric simulations of ecological dynamics, we show that our predictions, which consider the presence/absence of all species holistically, outperform both the null model that uses the statistics of each species independently and a predictive neural network model. We analyze real metagenomic data of human-associated microbial communities and found that by relying on a small number of  neighboring samples, i.e., samples with similar species assemblage, the kNN predicts the species abundance better than the whole-cohort average. By studying both real metagenomic and simulated data, we show that the predictability of our method is tightly related to the dissimilarity-overlap relationship of the training data. Our results demonstrate how model-free methods can prove useful in predicting microbial communities and may facilitate the development of microbial-based therapies.",

    "abstract": "The cort-adaptation and cort-fitness hypotheses both propose glucocorticoids produced by parents mediate trade-offs between their own survival and that of their offspring. The contribution of glucocorticoids to offspring provisioning can quantify these trade-offs because provisioning poses a risk to parents. However, attributing provisioning behaviour to glucocorticoids is difficult because glucocorticoids often drive foraging behaviours to store energy for later provisioning. We compared the effects of glucocorticoids on habitat selection before and after calving to test for the trade-offs female elk make when provisioning offspring. Despite finding that female elk with elevated glucocorticoids selected more strongly for high-risk, high-forage cropland, we found no difference in glucocorticoid production nor a significant change in the effect of glucocorticoids on cropland selection at calving time when lactating elk required the more energy. However, we found a gradual increase in the effect of glucocorticoids on cropland selection by female elk as their calves grew, suggesting the growing energy requirements of calves encouraged more risky habitat selection behaviours by their parents over time. We suggest trade-offs in investment between parents and offspring across life history stages can be tested by integrating glucocorticoids into habitat selection models. Ultimately, this integration will help elucidate the adaptive function of glucocorticoids.",

    "abstract": "Munc18-interacting proteins (Mints) are multi-domain adaptors that regulate neuronal membrane trafficking, signalling and neurotransmission. Mint1 and Mint2 are highly expressed in the brain with overlapping roles in the regulation of synaptic vesicle fusion required for neurotransmitter release by interacting with the essential synaptic protein Munc18-1. Here, we have used AlphaFold2 to identify and then validate the mechanisms that underpin both the specific interactions of neuronal Mint proteins with Munc18-1 as well as their wider interactome. We find a short acidic -helical motif (AHM) within Mint1 and Mint2 is necessary and sufficient for specific binding to Munc18-1 and binds a conserved surface on Munc18-1 domain3b. In Munc18-1/2 double knockout neurosecretory cells mutation of the Mint-binding site reduces the ability of Munc18-1 to rescue exocytosis, and although Munc18-1 can interact with Mint and Sx1a proteins simultaneously in vitro we find they have mutually reduced affinities, suggesting an allosteric coupling between the proteins. Using AlphaFold2 to then examine the entire cellular network of putative Mint interactors provides a structural model for their assembly with a variety of known and novel regulatory and cargo proteins including ARF3/ARF4 small GTPases, and the AP3 clathrin adaptor complex. Validation of Mint1 interaction with a new predicted binder TJAP1 provides experimental support that AlphaFold2 can correctly predict interactions across such large-scale datasets. Overall, our data provides insights into the diversity of interactions mediated by the Mint family and shows that Mints may help facilitate a key trigger point in SNARE complex assembly and vesicle fusion.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial populations that originate from a single bacterium are not strictly clonal. Often, they contain subgroups with distinct phenotypes. Bacteria can generate heterogeneity through phase variation: a preprogrammed, reversible mechanism that alters gene expression levels across a population. One well studied type of phase variation involves enzyme-mediated inversion of specific intergenic regions of genomic DNA. Frequently, these DNA inversions flip the orientation of promoters, turning ON or OFF adjacent coding regions within otherwise isogenic populations. Through this mechanism, inversion can affect fitness, survival, or group dynamics. Here, we develop and apply bioinformatic approaches to discover thousands of previously undescribed phase-variable regions in prokaryotes using long-read datasets. We identify  intragenic invertons, a surprising new class of invertible elements found entirely within genes, in bacteria and archaea. To date, inversions within single genes have not been described. Intragenic invertons allow a gene to encode two or more versions of a protein by flipping a DNA sequence within the coding region, thereby increasing coding capacity without increasing genome size. We experimentally characterize specific intragenic invertons in the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, presenting a  roadmap for investigating this new gene-diversifying phenomenon.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryIntragenic DNA inversions, identified using long-read sequencing datasets, are found in many phyla across the prokaryotic tree of life.",

    "abstract": "Transplacental antibody transfer is crucially important in shaping neonatal immunity. Recently, prenatal maternal immunization has been employed to boost pathogen-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) transfer to the fetus. Multiple factors have been implicated in antibody transfer, but how these key dynamic regulators work together to elicit the observed selectivity is pertinent to engineering vaccines for mothers to optimally immunize their newborns. Here, we present the first quantitative mechanistic model to uncover the determinants of placental antibody transfer and inform personalized immunization approaches. We identified placental Fc{gamma}RIIb expressed by endothelial cells as a limiting factor in receptor-mediated transfer, which plays a key role in promoting preferential transport of subclasses IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4, but not IgG2. Integrated computational modeling and in vitro experiments reveal that IgG subclass abundance, Fc receptor (FcR) binding affinity, and FcR abundance in syncytiotrophoblasts and endothelial cells contribute to inter-subclass competition and potentially inter-and intra-patient antibody transfer heterogeneity. We developed an in silico prenatal vaccine testbed by combining a computational model of maternal vaccination with this placental transfer model using the tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine as a case study. Model simulations unveiled precision prenatal immunization opportunities that account for a patients anticipated gestational length, placental size, and FcR expression by modulating vaccine timing, dosage, and adjuvant. This computational approach provides new perspectives on the dynamics of maternal-fetal antibody transfer in humans and potential avenues to optimize prenatal vaccinations that promote neonatal immunity.",

MYC, MYCN, and TSmiRs regulate glucose metabolism; however, their role in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis (UFAS) remains poorly understood. Here we show that de novo and UFAS pathway genes FASN, ELOVL6, SCD, FADS2, and FADS1 are upregulated in high-risk NB and are associated with poor prognosis. RNA-Seq analysis of eight human NB cell lines revealed parallel UFAS gene expression patterns. Consistent with this, we found that NB-related TSmiRs were predicted to extensively target these genes. In addition, we observed that both MYC and MYCN upregulated UFAS pathway genes while suppressing TSmiR host gene expression, thereby creating a possible UFAS regulatory network between MYCN and TSmiRs in NB. Furthermore, NB cells are high in omega 9 ({omega}9) unsaturated fatty acids that can be synthesized de novo and low in both {omega}6 and {omega}3, providing a plausible means for NB to limit cell-autonomous immune stimulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-driven apoptosis from {omega}6 and {omega}3 unsaturated fatty acid derivatives, respectively.

    "abstract": "Understanding the organization of computations in cortical microcircuits is one of the most important and challenging scientific problems of our era. In spite of tremendous progress in experimental techniques, we are still lacking tools for elucidating causal relations between their structure and computational function. We present a new tool for that: Training of large-scale models of cortical microcircuits, which integrate most of our current knowledge about their structure, for carrying out the same computational tasks as used in behavioral experiments. We show that the trained model achieves the same performance level as the intact animal, and also reproduces numerous experimentally found traits of neural coding and computations. Importantly, it allows us in addition to determine to what extent specific details of the structure of cortical microcircuits, such as their laminar architecture and neuron diversity, are causally related to their computational function. Furthermore, we can track the flow of information, and use that to reverse-engineer the computational organization of the model. This allows us to produce new hypotheses about the organization of cortical computation that can readily be tested in vivo. In fact, we have verified a model-generated hypothesis about coding of information about current and preceding visual stimuli in the temporal order of peak firing activity of neurons in mouse v1 by re-analyzing in vivo recordings from mouse V1 for the same computational task.",

    "abstract": "Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is commonly used as an adjuvant drug therapy for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers. While this drug is effective at reducing the rate of cancer recurrence, many patients report unwanted cognitive and affective side effects such as brain fog, confusion, memory impairment, anxiety, and depression. Despite this, the impacts of chronic tamoxifen exposure on the brain are poorly understood, and rodent models of tamoxifen exposure do not replicate the chronic oral administration seen in patients. We therefore used long-term ad lib consumption of medicated food pellets in adult female rats to model chronic tamoxifen exposure in a clinically-relevant way. Gonadally-intact adult female Long-Evans Hooded rats consumed tamoxifen medicated food pellets for approximately 12 weeks while control animals received standard chow. At the conclusion of the experiment, animals were euthanized, and blood and brain samples were collected for analyses. Blood tamoxifen levels were measured using a novel ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay, which found that this administration paradigm produced serum levels of tamoxifen similar to those in human patients. In the brain, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was visualized in the hippocampus using immunohistochemistry and quantified using background-subtracted optical densitometry. Chronic oral tamoxifen treatment resulted in a decrease in BDNF expression across several regions of the hippocampus. Together, these findings provide a novel method of modeling and measuring chronic oral tamoxifen exposure, and suggest a putative mechanism by which tamoxifen may cause cognitive and behavioral changes reported by patients.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD), along with related mood disorders, is a debilitating illness that affects millions of individuals worldwide. While chronic stress increases incidence levels of mood disorders, stress-mediated disruptions in brain function that precipitate these illnesses remain elusive. Serotonin-associated antidepressants (ADs) remain the first line of therapy for many with depressive symptoms, yet low remission rates and delays between treatment and symptomatic alleviation have prompted skepticism regarding precise roles for serotonin in the precipitation of mood disorders. Our group recently demonstrated that serotonin epigenetically modifies histone proteins (H3K4me3Q5ser) to regulate transcriptional permissiveness in brain. However, this phenomenon has not yet been explored following stress and/or AD exposures.\n\nMethodsWe employed a combination of genome-wide and biochemical analyses in dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of male and female mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress to examine the impact of stress exposures on H3K4me3Q5ser dynamics, as well as associations between the mark and stress-induced gene expression. We additionally assessed stress-induced regulation of H3K4me3Q5ser following AD exposures, and employed viral-mediated gene therapy to reduce H3K4me3Q5ser levels in DRN and examine the impact on stress-associated gene expression and behavior.\n\nResultsWe found that H3K4me3Q5ser plays important roles in stress-mediated transcriptional plasticity. Chronically stressed mice displayed dysregulated H3K4me3Q5ser dynamics in DRN, with both AD- and viral-mediated disruption of these dynamics proving sufficient to rescue stress-mediated gene expression and behavior.\n\nConclusionsThese findings establish a neurotransmission-independent role for serotonin in stress-/AD-associated transcriptional and behavioral plasticity in DRN.",

    "abstract": "Articulography and functional neuroimaging are two major tools for studying the neurobiology of speech production. Until now, however, it has generally not been feasible to use both in the same experimental setup because of technical incompatibilities between the two methodologies. Here we describe results from a novel articulography system dubbed Magneto-articulography for the Assessment of Speech Kinematics (MASK; Alves et al., 2016), which is technically compatible with magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain scanning systems. In the present paper we describe our methodological and analytic approach for extracting brain motor activities related to key kinematic and coordination event parameters derived from time-registered MASK tracking measurements (Anastasopoulou et al., 2022). Data were collected from ten healthy adults with tracking coils on the tongue, lips, and jaw. Analyses targeted the gestural landmarks of reiterated utterances /ipa/ and /api/, produced at normal and faster rates (Anastasopoulou et al., 2022; Van Lieshout, 2007). The results show that (1) Speech sensorimotor cortex can be reliably located in peri-rolandic regions of the left hemisphere; (2) mu (8-12 Hz) and beta band (13-30 Hz) neuromotor oscillations are present in the speech signals and contain information structures that are independent of those present in higher-frequency broadband noise signals associated with overt speech movements in the MEG scanner; and (3) kinematic parameters of speech movements can be mapped on to neuromagnetic brain signals using multivariate pattern analytic techniques. These results show that MASK provides the capability, for the first time, for deriving subject-specific articulatory parameters, based on well-established and robust motor control parameters, in the same experimental setup as the brain recordings and in temporal and spatial co-register with the brain data. The co-registered MASK data improves the precision and inferential power of MEG measures of speech-related brain activity compared to previous methodological approaches. This new capability for measuring and characterising speech movement parameters, and the brain activities that control them, within the same experimental setup, paves the way for innovative cross-disciplinary studies of neuromotor control of human speech production, speech development, and speech motor disorders.",

    "abstract": "In response to luteinizing hormone, multiple proteins in rat and mouse granulosa cells are rapidly dephosphorylated, but the responsible phosphatases remain to be identified. Because the phosphorylation state of phosphatases can regulate their interaction with substrates, we searched for phosphatases that might function in LH signaling by using quantitative mass spectrometry. We identified all proteins in rat ovarian follicles whose phosphorylation state changed detectably in response to a 30-minute exposure to LH, and within this list, identified protein phosphatases or phosphatase regulatory subunits that showed changes in phosphorylation. Phosphatases in the PPP family were of particular interest because of their requirement for dephosphorylating the natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPR2) guanylyl cyclase in the granulosa cells, which triggers oocyte meiotic resumption. Among the PPP family regulatory subunits, PPP1R12A and PPP2R5D showed the largest increases in phosphorylation, with 4-10 fold increases in signal intensity on several sites. Although follicles from mice in which these phosphorylations were prevented by serine-to-alanine mutations in either Ppp1r12a or Ppp2r5d showed normal LH-induced NPR2 dephosphorylation, these regulatory subunits and others could act redundantly to dephosphorylate NPR2. Our identification of phosphatases and other proteins whose phosphorylation state is rapidly modified by LH provides clues about multiple signaling pathways in ovarian follicles.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/544636v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2622cdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b6eef7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@102da9borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5e3221_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Summary sentenceQuantitative mass spectrometric analysis of phosphatases whose phosphorylation state is rapidly modified by luteinizing hormone provides clues about how LH signaling dephosphorylates NPR2 as well as a resource for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Improving the spatial resolution of a fluorescence microscope has been an ongoing challenge in the imaging community. To address this challenge, a variety of approaches have been taken, ranging from instrumentation development to image post-processing. An example of the latter is deconvolution, where images are numerically deblurred based on a knowledge of the microscope point spread function. However, deconvolution can easily lead to noise-amplification artifacts. Deblurring by post-processing can also lead to negativities or fail to conserve local linearity between sample and image. We describe here a simple image deblurring algorithm based on pixel reassignment that inherently avoids such artifacts and can be applied to general microscope modalities and fluorophore types. Our algorithm helps distinguish nearby fluorophores even when these are separated by distances smaller than the conventional resolution limit, helping facilitate, for example, the application of single-molecule localization microscopy in dense samples. We demonstrate the versatility and performance of our algorithm under a variety of imaging conditions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMany biological and medical questions are answered based on the analysis of sequence data. However, we can find contaminations, artificial spike-ins, and overrepresented rRNA sequences in various read collections and assemblies; complicating data analysis and making interpretation difficult. In particular, spike-ins used as controls, such as those known from Illumina (PhiX phage) or Nanopore data (DNA CS lambda phage, yeast enolase ENO2), are often not considered as contaminants and also not appropriately removed during bioinformatics analyses.\n\nFindingsTo address this, we developed CLEAN, a pipeline to remove unwanted sequence data from both long and short read sequencing techniques from a wide range of use cases. While focusing on Illumina and Nanopore data and removing of their technology-specific control sequences, the pipeline can also be used for everyday tasks, such as host decontamination of metagenomic reads and assemblies, or the removal of rRNA from RNA-Seq data. The results are the purified sequences and the sequences identified as contaminated with statistics summarized in an HTML report.\n\nConclusionsThe decontaminated output files can be used directly in subsequent analyses, resulting in faster computations and improved results. Although decontamination is a task that seems mundane, many contaminants are routinely overlooked, cleaned by steps that are not fully reproducible or difficult to trace by the user.

In this work we investigated how protein glycosylation and lateral crowding effects modulate an array of properties characterizing the stability and dynamics of influenza neuraminidase. We constructed three systems: 1) Glycosylated neuraminidase in a whole virion (i.e. crowded membrane) environment 2) Glycosylated neuraminidase in its own lipid bilayer 3) Unglycosylated neuraminidase in its own lipid bilayer. We saw that glycans tend to stabilize the protein structure and reduce its conformational flexibility while restricting solvent movement. Conversely, a crowded membrane environment encouraged exploration of the free energy landscape and a large scale conformational change while making the protein structure more compact. Understanding these effects informs what factors one must consider while attempting to recapture the desired level of physical accuracy.\n\nTOC figure\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=50 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/556910v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ec7a9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@563495org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1965cd7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a9659d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG TOC.

    "abstract": "Plants shed organs like leaves, petals or fruits through the process of abscission. Monitoring cues like age, resource availability, biotic and abiotic stresses allows plants to abscise organs in a timely manner. How these signals are integrated in the molecular pathways that drive abscission is largely unknown. The INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA) gene is one of the main drivers of floral organ abscission in Arabidopsis and is known to transcriptionally respond to most abscission-regulating cues. Interrogating the IDA promoter in silico and in vitro we identified transcription factors that can potentially modulate IDA expression. We functionally characterized the importance of ERF and WRKY binding sites for IDA expression during floral organ abscission, with WRKYs being of special relevance to mediate IDA upregulation in response to biotic stress in tissues destined for separation. We further characterized WRKY57 as a positive regulator of IDA and IDA-like gene expression in abscission zones. Our findings highlight the promise of promoter element-targeted approaches to modulate the responsiveness of the IDA signaling pathway to harness controlled abscission timing for improved crop productivity.\n\nHighlightERF and WRKY transcription factors distinctly contribute to the regulation of IDA expression and thereby abscission timing.

    "abstract": "The human mitochondrial chaperonin Hsp60/Hsp10 plays an essential role in maintaining protein homeostasis through an ATP dependent protein refolding mechanism. In the absence of this chaperonin, all cells perish due to an accumulation of misfolded aggregates. Despite its importance, the detailed mechanism of ATP hydrolysis and the role of the C-terminal tail remains unresolved. Here we show that the C-terminal tail acts as a sensor for the arrival of substrate into the chaperonin internal chamber that directly leads to an allosteric trigger of ATP hydrolysis in a neighboring subunit. Our results reveal that removal of the C-terminal tail leads to normal binding of both ATP and a misfolded substrate, but the chaperonin stalls and is unable to progress along the protein folding reaction cycle because it has lost the ability to sense the presence of substrate. High resolution reconstructions reveal the detailed mechanism of ATP hydrolysis where access to the {gamma}-phosphate is blocked by the carboxylate oxygen of an aspartate residue. Binding of the C-terminal tail to substrate displaces this oxygen and allows ATP hydrolysis. These results bring a better understanding of how Hsp60 functions at an atomic level where substrate arrival activates ATP hydrolysis through an allosteric trigger.",

    "abstract": "Single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs) are ubiquitous across all domains of life and play essential roles via stabilizing and protecting single-stranded (ss) DNA as well as organizing multiprotein complexes during DNA replication, recombination, and repair. Two mammalian SSB paralogs (hSSB1 and hSSB2 in humans) were recently identified and shown to be involved in various genome maintenance processes. Following our recent discovery of the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) propensity of E. coli (Ec) SSB, here we show that hSSB2 also forms LLPS condensates under physiologically relevant ionic conditions. Similar to that seen for EcSSB, we demonstrate the essential contribution of hSSB2s C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) to condensate formation, and the selective enrichment of various genome metabolic proteins in hSSB2 condensates. However, in contrast to EcSSB-driven LLPS that is inhibited by ssDNA binding, hSSB2 phase separation requires single-stranded nucleic acid binding, and is especially facilitated by ssDNA. Our results reveal an evolutionarily conserved role for SSB-mediated LLPS in the spatiotemporal organization of genome maintenance complexes. At the same time, differential LLPS features of EcSSB and hSSB2 point to functional adaptations to prokaryotic versus eukaryotic genome metabolic contexts.",

    "abstract": "PIP3-dependent Rac exchanger 1 (P-Rex1) is abundantly expressed in neutrophils and plays central roles in chemotaxis and cancer metastasis by serving as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac. The enzyme is synergistically activated by PIP3 and the heterotrimeric G{beta}{gamma} subunits, but mechanistic details remain poorly understood. While investigating the regulation of P-Rex1 by PIP3, we discovered that Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (IP4) inhibits P-Rex1 activity and induces large decreases in backbone dynamics in diverse regions of the protein. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of the P-Rex1{middle dot}IP4 complex revealed a conformation wherein the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain occludes the active site of the Dbl homology (DH) domain. This configuration is stabilized by interactions between the first DEP domain (DEP1) and the DH domain and between the PH domain and a 4-helix bundle (4HB) subdomain that extends from the C-terminal domain of P-Rex1. Disruption of the DH-DEP1 interface in a DH/PH-DEP1 fragment enhanced activity and led to a more extended conformation in solution, whereas mutations that constrain the occluded conformation led to decreased GEF activity. Variants of full-length P-Rex1 in which the DH-DEP1 and PH-4HB interfaces were disturbed exhibited enhanced activity during chemokine-induced cell migration, confirming that the observed structure represents the autoinhibited state in living cells. Interactions with PIP3-containing liposomes led to disruption of these interfaces and increased dynamics protein-wide. Our results further suggest that inositol phosphates such as IP4 help to inhibit basal P-Rex1 activity in neutrophils, similar to their inhibitory effects on phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase.",

Previous investigations have demonstrated that PKM2 is subject to O-linked {beta}-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification, which is a nutrient-sensitive post-translational modification. Here we found that unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1), a glucose-sensitive kinase, interacts with PKM2 and phosphorylates PKM2 at Ser333. Ser333 phosphorylation antagonizes PKM2 O-GlcNAcylation, promotes its tetramer formation and enzymatic activity, and decreases its nuclear localization. By downregulating glucose consumption and lactate production, PKM2 pS333 attenuates the Warburg effect. Through mouse xenograft assays, we demonstrate that the phospho-deficient PKM2-S333A mutant promotes tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, we identified a ULK1-PKM2-c-Myc axis in inhibiting breast cancer, and a glucose-sensitive phosphorylation of PKM2 in modulating the Warburg effect.",

    "abstract": "Seizures are increasingly being recognized as the hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD). Neuronal hyperactivity can be a consequence of neuronal damage caused by abnormal amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) depositions. However, it can also be a cell-autonomous phenomenon causing AD by A{beta}-independent mechanisms. Indeed, various studies using animal models showed that Ca2+ releases from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via type 1 inositol triphosphate receptors (InsP3R1s) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs). To investigate which is the main pathophysiological mechanism in human neurons, we measured Ca2+ signaling in neural cells derived from three early-onset AD patients harboring variants of Presenilin-1 (PSEN1 p.A246E, p.L286V, and p.M146L). Of these, it has been reported that PSEN1 p.A246E and p.L286V did not produce a significant amount of abnormal A{beta}. We found that all PSEN1-mutant neurons, but not wild-type, caused abnormal Ca2+-bursts in a manner dependent on the calcium channel, Ryanodine Receptor 2 (RyR2). Indeed, carvedilol, anRyR2 inhibitor, and VK-II-86, an analog of carvedilol without the {beta}-blocking effects, sufficiently eliminated the abnormal Ca2+ bursts. In contrast, Dantrolene, a RyR1 inhibitor, and Xestospongin c, an IP3R inhibitor, did not attenuate the Ca2+-bursts. The RNA-Seq data revealed that ER-stress responsive genes were increased, and mitochondrial Ca2+-transporter genes were decreased in PSEN1A246E cells compared to the WT neurons. Thus, we propose that aberrant Ca2+ signaling is a key link between human pathogenic PSEN1 variants and cell-intrinsic hyperactivity prior to deposition of abnormal A{beta}, offering prospects for the development of targeted prevention strategies for at-risk individuals.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryAberrant Ca2+-signaling causes PSEN1-related early onset Alzheimers disease.",

Type III cells form conventional chemical synapses, whereas type II cells form a unique type of synapses referred to as channel synapses, which release adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a neurotransmitter through voltage-gated channels comprising calcium homeostasis modulator (CALHM) 1 and CALHM3. Further, channel synapses are associated with large mitochondria with tubular cristae known as atypical mitochondria, which are believed to produce ATP for neurotransmission. Herein, we aimed to generate a monoclonal antibody against CALHM1 and examine its localization in taste buds using immunoelectron microscopy. CALHM1 was detected along the plasma membrane apposed to atypical mitochondria, indicating that CALHM1 is localized at the presynaptic membrane of channel synapses. Additionally, CALHM1 was detected along the plasma membrane lined by subsurface cisternae at sites apposed to afferent nerve fibers.",

    "abstract": "Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport (GWOT) has emerged as a versatile method for unsupervised alignment in various research areas, including neuroscience, drawing upon the strengths of optimal transport theory. However, the use of GWOT in various applications has been hindered by the difficulty of finding good optima, a significant challenge stemming from GWOTs nature as a non-convex optimization method. It is often difficult to avoid suboptimal local optima because of the need for systematic hyperparameter tuning. To overcome these obstacles, this paper presents a user-friendly GWOT hyperparameter tuning toolbox (GWTune) specifically designed to streamline the use of GWOT in neuroscience and other fields. The toolbox incorporates Optuna, an advanced hyperparameter tuning tool that uses Bayesian sampling to increase the chances of finding favorable local optima. To demonstrate the utility of our toolbox, we first illustrate the qualitative difference between the conventional supervised alignment method and our unsupervised alignment method using synthetic data. Then, we demonstrate the applicability of our toolbox using some typical examples in neuroscience. Specifically, we applied GWOT to the similarity structures of natural objects or natural scenes obtained from three data domains: behavioral data, neural data, and neural network models. This toolbox is an accessible and robust solution for practical applications in neuroscience and beyond, making the powerful GWOT methodology more accessible to a wider range of users. The open source code for the toolbox is available on GitHub. This work not only facilitates the application of GWOT, but also opens avenues for future improvements and extensions.",

Here we report the development of the projections from the motor cortex governing whisker and neck movements to the striatum. Corticostriatal projections from this area were mainly ipsilateral and also underwent a progressive, postnatal development. The pyramidal tract and its collaterals to the dorsal striatum appeared on the day of birth (postanatal day 0 (P0)), peaked on P6 in density, and continued to be tuned until P36. The intertelencephalic projections in the dorsolateral striatum were established between P6 and P12 and continued to be refined between P20 and P36. Neurons in this motor cortex sent their axons to the contralateral motor cortex via the corpus callosum at the age between P6 and P12. Our results suggest that the time window between P6 and P12 is critical for the development of the projections from the motor cortex governing whisker and neck movement to the striatum in the rat. The overall process of the development of this circuitry appears to correspond to the functional development of whisker movement and locomotor activities.",

    "abstract": "The neuronal K/Cl cotransporter KCC2 controls intraneuronal chloride and subsequently the efficiency of GABA signaling. In many neurological disorders, including mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), reduced KCC2 expression or function may lead to depolarizing GABA signaling, which may then contribute to pathological activity and seizures. Compensating for the dysregulation of chloride transport in the pathology therefore appears to be a promising therapeutic strategy. Two small molecules - prochlorperazine (PCPZ) and CLP-257 - recently identified from library screening as candidate KCC2 enhancers, appear to improve symptoms in animal models of disorders associated with KCC2 extinction. However, their mode of action in cortical neurons and their therapeutic potential in epilepsy remain elusive and even controversial. Here, we show in rat hippocampal neurons that PCPZ and CLP-257 act by increasing KCC2 function and clustering while decreasing its membrane diffusion, independent of phosphorylation of canonical regulatory residues. Consistently, both compounds suppress spontaneous interictal-like discharges in postoperative tissue from patients with mTLE. Chronic administration of PCPZ also reduces seizure frequency and interictal activity in a mouse model of mTLE. These results unravel the mechanism of action of two KCC2 enhancers and validate their therapeutic potential in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "A narrative is a coherent representation of actual or fictional events designed to connect experiences. Narratives provide a unique opportunity to investigate brain functions in scenarios more closely resembling real-world experiences. However, most neuroimaging studies examining narrative formation have utilized static stimuli that fail to capture the intricacies of narrative construction in everyday life, particularly how cognitive demands change over the course of narrative processing. The current research uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine dynamic narrative processing over the course of a full-length audiovisual narrative. We examined changes in neural synchrony (as quantified by intersubject correlations) in areas related to semantic memory, episodic memory, and visuospatial attention between the beginning, middle, and end of the narrative. Results from two experiments identified two core narrative processing networks responsible for constructing coherent representations across extended timescales. The first network is associated with the early narrative construction, and includes the right intraparietal sulcus/superior parietal lobule, bilateral angular gyrus, bilateral precuneus, and left fusiform gyrus. The second network consists of the right ventral frontal cortex and bilateral parahippocampal cortices, and is associated with longer term narrative integration. Together, these regions provide the framework for successful narrative processing during naturalistic stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Animals have myriad adaptations to help them hunt in the most efficient and effective manner. One mysterious behavior suspected to be related to hunting is the posterior toe tapping behavior of some frogs. Biologists and hobbyists alike have long noticed this behavior, but there is little empirical data to explain its function. To test the hypothesis that tapping is related to feeding we conducted a series of related experiments in the Dyeing poison frog, Dendrobates tinctorius. We suspected mechanostimulation of prey through vibrational stimuli from tapping might induce prey movement and thereby facilitate prey detection by frogs. First, we confirmed that tap rate was higher during feeding. We next asked whether frogs tapped more under conditions when vibrational contact between frogs and prey was possible. Finally, we asked whether D. tinctorius tap more on more vibrationally responsive surfaces and whether prey capture success was higher when tapping. While previous studies have noted an association between toe tapping and feeding behavior our work here is the first to do so quantitatively and experimentally, confirming the impressive speed with which frogs perform the behavior.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) can cause long-lasting locomotor deficits, pain, and mood disorders. Anatomical and functional outcomes are exacerbated by inflammation after SCI, which causes secondary damage. One promising target after SCI is manipulating the circadian system, which optimizes biology and behavior for time of day - including neuroimmune responses and mood-related behaviors. Circadian disruption after SCI is likely worsened by a disruptive hospital environment, which typically includes dim light-at-night (dLAN). Here, we hypothesized that mice subjected to SCI, then placed in dLAN, would exhibit worsened locomotor deficits, pain-like behavior, and anxiety-depressive-like symptoms compared to mice maintained in light days with dark nights (LD). C57BL6/J mice received sham surgery or moderate T9 contusion SCI, then were placed permanently in LD or dLAN. dLAN after SCI did not worsen locomotor deficits; rather, SCI-dLAN mice showed slight improvement in open-field locomotion at the final timepoint. Although dLAN did not alter SCI-induced heat hyperalgesia, SCI-dLAN mice exhibited worsened mechanical allodynia at 13 days post-SCI compared to SCI-LD mice. SCI-LD and SCI-dLAN mice had similar outcomes using sucrose preference (depressive-like) and open-field (anxiety-like) tests. At 21 dpo, SCI-dLAN mice had reduced preference for a novel juvenile compared to SCI-LD, implying that dLAN combined with SCI may worsen this mood-related behavior. Finally, lesion size was similar between SCI-LD and SCI-dLAN mice. Therefore, newly placing C57BL6/J mice in dLAN after SCI had modest effects on locomotor, pain-like, and mood-related behaviors. Future studies should consider whether clinically-relevant circadian disruptors, alone or in combination, could be ameliorated to enhance outcomes after SCI.",

    "abstract": "Striatum, the input stage of the basal ganglia, is important for sensory-motor integration, initiation and selection of behaviour, as well as reward learning. Striatum receives glutamatergic inputs from mainly cortex and thalamus. In rodents, the striatal projection neurons (SPNs), giving rise to the direct and the indirect pathway (dSPNs and iSPNs, respectively), account for 95% of the neurons and the remaining 5% are GABAergic and cholinergic interneurons. Interneuron axon terminals as well as local dSPN and iSPN axon collaterals form an intricate striatal network. Following chronic dopamine depletion as in Parkinsons disease (PD), both morphological and electrophysiological striatal neuronal features are altered. Our goal with this in-silico study is twofold: a) to predict and quantify how the intrastriatal network connectivity structure becomes altered as a consequence of the morphological changes reported at the single neuron level, and b) to investigate how the effective glutamate drive to the SPNs would need to be altered to account for the activity level seen in SPNs during PD. In summary we find that the richness of the connectivity motifs is significantly decreased during PD, while at the same time a substantial enhancement of the effective glutamatergic drive to striatum is present.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThis in-silico study predicts that the impact the neuronal morphological alterations have on the striatal microcircuit connectivity. We find that the richness in the topological striatal motifs is significantly reduced in Parkinsons disease, highlighting that just measuring the pairwise connectivity between neurons gives an incomplete description of network connectivity. Also we predict how the resulting electrophysiological changes of SPN excitability together with their reduced number of dendritic branches affect their response to the glutamate drive from cortex and thalamus. We find that the effective glutamatergic drive is likely significantly increased in PD, in accordance with the hyperglutamatergic hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Human brain activities measured by fMRI can be categorized into at least two distinct categories; 1) spontaneous: slow (< 0.1 Hz) but inter-regionally coherent fluctuations in MR signal, and 2) task-evoked: change in the MR signal due to external stimulation. To date, there is no consensus in the field about the roles of spontaneous brain activity and whether it interacts with task-evoked activity. This is mainly because direct measurements of spontaneous activity during task performance is challenging, if not impossible. Here for the first time, we used a data-driven approach to obtain the time course of the spontaneous brain activity in two of the well-studied brain networks; 1) the Default mode network (DMN), where the strongest task-evoked negative BOLD response is also observed and 2) the dorsal attention network (DAN), where some of the strongest task-evoked positive BOLD response is observed. Voxel-wise multiple regression analysis is used to model fMRI timeseries with anticipated task-evoked BOLD response, the obtain time course of the spontaneous activity, and their interaction at each participant. Using 46 young and cognitively normal participants performing an event-related perceptual speed task inside the fMRI scanner, we showed that there is no significant interaction between the spontaneous and the task-evoked activity either as negative BOLD response in the DMN or as positive BOLD response in the DAN. We replicate our findings in a separate dataset with 24 young and cognitively normal participants performing a different event-related task inside another fMRI scanner. Our results suggest that the presence or absence of coherent spontaneous activity in the DMN, or DAN has negligible effect on the magnitude of the BOLD response and vice versa, which consequently means that the fMRI signal is a linear superposition of spontaneous and task evoked activity.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing question in vision science is how the three cone photoreceptor types - long (L), medium (M) and short (S) wavelength sensitive - combine to generate our perception of color. Hue perception can be described along two opponent axes: red-green and blue-yellow. Psychophysical measurements of color appearance indicate that the cone inputs to the red-green and blue-yellow opponent axes are M vs. L+S and L vs. M+S, respectively. However, the \"cardinal directions of color space\" revealed by psychophysical measurements of color detection thresholds are L vs. M and S vs. L+M. The cardinal directions match the most common cone-opponent retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the primate retina. Accordingly, the cone opponency necessary for color appearance is thought to be established in cortex. However, small populations with the appropriate M vs. L+S and L vs. M+S cone-opponency have been reported in large surveys of cone inputs to primate RGCs and their projections to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) yet their existence continues to be debated. Resolving this long-standing open question is needed as a complete account of the cone-opponency in the retinal output is critical for efforts to understand how downstream neural circuits process color. Here, we performed adaptive optics calcium imaging to longitudinally and noninvasively measurements of the foveal RGC light responses in the living macaque eye. We confirm the presence of L vs. M+S and M vs. L+S neurons with non-cardinal cone-opponency and demonstrate that cone-opponent signals in the retinal output are substantially more diverse than classically thought.",

Although cortical gyrification is increasingly considered a useful index for understanding cognitive and emotional outcomes in adolescence, and sleep is also a strong predictor of such outcomes, we know relatively little about associations between cortical gyrification and sleep.\n\nMethodsUsing Local gyrification index (lGI) of 34 bilateral brain regions and regularized regression for feature selection, we examined gyrification-sleep relationships in the Neuroimaging and Pediatric Sleep databank (252 participants; 9-26 years; 58.3% female) and identified developmentally invariant (stable across age) or developmentally specific (observed only during discrete age intervals) brain-sleep associations. Naturalistic sleep characteristics (duration, timing, continuity, and regularity) were estimated from wrist actigraphy.\n\nResultsFor most brain regions, greater lGI was associated with longer sleep duration, earlier sleep timing, lower variability in sleep regularity, and shorter time awake after sleep onset. lGI in frontoparietal network regions showed associations with sleep patterns that were stable across age. However, in default mode network regions, lGI was only associated with sleep patterns from late childhood through early-to-mid adolescence, a period of vulnerability for mental health disorders.\n\nConclusionsWe detected both developmentally invariant and developmentally specific ties between local gyrification and naturalistic sleep patterns. Default mode network regions may be particularly susceptible to interventions promoting more optimal sleep during childhood and adolescence.",

    "abstract": "In conceptual spaces, the distance between concepts is represented by a metric that cannot usually be expressed as a function of a few, salient physical properties of the represented items. For example, the space of colours can be endowed with a metric capturing the degree to which two chromatic stimuli are perceived as different. But as many optical illusions have shown, the colour with which a stimulus is perceived depends, among other contextual factors, on the chromaticity of its surround, an effect called \"chromatic induction\". The surround pushes the colour of the stimulus away from its own chromaticity, increasing the salience of the boundary. Previous studies have described how the magnitude of the push depends on the chromaticity of both the stimulus and the surround, concluding that the space of colours contains anisotropies and inhomogeneities. The importance of contextuality has cast doubt on the practical or predictive utility of perceptual metrics, beyond a mathematical curiosity. Here we provide evidence that the metric structure of the space of colours is indeed useful and has predictive power. By using a notion of distance between colours emerging from a subjective metric, we show that the anisotropies and inhomogeneities reported in previous studies can be eliminated. The resulting symmetry allows us to derive a universal curve for the average chromatic induction that contains no fitting parameters and is confirmed by experimental data. The theory also predicts the magnitude of chromatic induction for every possible combination of stimulus and surround demonstrating that, at least in the case of colours, the metric captures the symmetries of perception, and augments the predictive power of theories.",

    "abstract": "Yoga Nidra practice aims to induce a deeply relaxed state akin to sleep while maintaining heightened awareness. Despite the growing interest in its clinical applications, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying neural correlates of the practice of Yoga Nidra (YN) remains largely unexplored. In this novel fMRI investigation, we aim to discover the differences between wakeful resting states and states attained during YN practice. The study included individuals experienced in meditation and/or yogic practices, referred to as  meditators (n=30), and novice controls (n=31). The GLM analysis, based on audio instructions, demonstrated activation related to auditory cues without concurrent Default Mode Network (DMN) deactivation. Additionally, meditators exhibited heightened bilateral thalamic activation compared to novices. DMN seed based Functional connectivity (FC) analysis revealed significant reductions in connectivity among meditators during YN as compared to controls. We did not find differences between the two groups during the pre and post resting state scans. Moreover, when DMN-FC was compared between the YN state and resting state, meditators showed distinct decoupling, whereas controls showed increased DMN-FC. Finally, meditators exhibit a remarkable correlation between reduced DMN connectivity during Yoga Nidra and self-reported hours of cumulative meditation and yoga practice. Together, these results suggest a unique neural modulation of the DMN in meditators during Yoga Nidra which results in being restful yet aware, aligned with their subjective experience of the practice. The study deepens our understanding of the neural mechanisms of Yoga Nidra, revealing distinct DMN connectivity decoupling in meditators and its relationship with meditation and yoga experience. These findings have interdisciplinary implications for neuroscience, psychology, and yogic disciplines.",

In Drosophila, intersectional split-GAL4 drivers and electron microscopy (EM) connectomes have laid the foundation for precise interrogation of the MB neural circuits. However, many cell types upstream and downstream of the MB remained to be investigated due to lack of driver lines. Here we describe a new collection of over 800 split-GAL4 and split-LexA drivers that cover approximately 300 cell types, including sugar sensory neurons, putative nociceptive ascending neurons, olfactory and thermo-/hygro-sensory projection neurons, interneurons connected with the MB-extrinsic neurons, and various other cell types. We characterized activation phenotypes for a subset of these lines and identified the sugar sensory neuron line most suitable for reward substitution. Leveraging the thousands of confocal microscopy images associated with the collection, we analyzed neuronal morphological stereotypy and discovered that one set of mushroom body output neurons, MBON08/MBON09, exhibits striking individuality and asymmetry across animals. In conjunction with the EM connectome maps, the driver lines reported here offer a powerful resource for functional dissection of neural circuits for associative learning in adult Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Knock-in reporter (KI) animals are essential tools in biomedical research to study gene expression impacting diverse biological events. While CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing allows for the successful generation of KI animals, several factors should be considered, such as low expression of the target gene, prevention of bacterial DNA integration, and in-frame editing. To circumvent these challenges, we developed a new strategy that utilizes minicircle technology and introduces a minimal promoter. We demonstrated that minicircles serve as an efficient donor DNA in zebrafish, significantly enhancing KI events compared to plasmids containing bacterial backbones. In an attempt to generate a KI reporter for scn8ab, we precisely integrated a fluorescence gene at the start codon. However, the seamlessly integrated reporter was unable to direct expression that recapitulates endogenous scn8ab expression. To overcome this obstacle, we introduced the hsp70 minimal promoter to provide an ectopic transcription initiation site and succeeded in establishing stable KI transgenic reporters for scn8ab. This strategy also created a fgf20b KI reporter line with a high success rate. Furthermore, our data revealed that an unexpectedly edited genome can inappropriately influence the integrated reporter gene expression, highlighting the importance of selecting a proper KI line. Overall, our approach utilizing a minicircle and an ectopic promoter establishes a robust and efficient strategy for KI generation, expanding our capacity to create KI animals.",

    "abstract": "Adult planarians can grow when fed and degrow (shrink) when starved while maintaining their whole-body shape with correct proportions. Different planarian morphogens are expressed at the anterior-posterior poles, medio-lateral border, and midline to provide positional information signals for the specification of different tissues at the right locations. However, it is currently unknown how these signals are coordinated together during feeding or starvation and how they modulate the differential tissue growth or degrowth necessary to form correct whole-body shapes. Here we investigate the dynamics of planarian shape during growth and degrowth together with a theoretical study to evaluate the mechanisms that regulate whole-body proportions and shape. We found that the planarian body proportions scale isometrically following similar linear rates during growth and degrowth, but that fed worms are significantly wider than starved worms. By combining a descriptive model of planarian shape and size with a mechanistic model of anterior-posterior and medio-lateral signaling calibrated with a novel machine learning methodology, we demonstrate that the feedback loop between these positional information signals and the shape they control can regulate the planarian whole-body shape during growth. Furthermore, the model can predict the correct shape and size dynamics during degrowth due to an increase in apoptosis rate and pole signal during starvation. These results offer mechanistic insights into planarian shape and size dynamics and the regulation of whole-body morphologies.",

    "abstract": "Mother-infant interactions during the early postnatal period are critical for infant survival and the scaffolding of infant development. Rodent models are used extensively to understand how these early social experiences influence neurobiology across the lifespan. However, methods for measuring postnatal dam-pup interactions typically involve time-consuming manual scoring, vary widely between research groups, and produce low density data that limits downstream analytical applications. To address these methodological issues, we developed the Automated Maternal Behavior during Early life in Rodents (AMBER) pipeline for quantifying home-cage maternal and mother-pup interactions using open-source machine learning tools. DeepLabCut was used to track key points on rat dams (32 points) and individual pups (9 points per pup) in postnatal day 1-10 video recordings. Pose estimation models reached test errors of 14.39 pixels and 11.81 pixels for dam and pups respectively. Pose estimation data and human-annotated behavior labels from 30 videos were used with Simple Behavioral Analysis (SimBA) to generate behavior classifiers for dam active nursing, passive nursing, nest attendance, licking and grooming, self-directed grooming, eating, and drinking using random forest algorithms. All classifiers had excellent performance, with F1 scores above .997. A set of 242 videos was used with AMBER and produced behavior measures in the expected range from postnatal 1-10 home-cage videos. This pipeline provides a basis for assessing home-cage dam-pup interactions that reduces experimenter burden while increasing reproducibility, reliability, and detail of data for use in developmental studies without the need for special housing systems or proprietary software.",

    "abstract": "Individually distinctive vocalizations are widespread in nature, although the ability of receivers to discriminate these signals has only been studied through limited taxonomic and social lenses. Here we ask whether anuran advertisement calls, typically studied for their role in territory defense and mate attraction, facilitate recognition and preferential association with partners in a pair bonding poison frog. Combining no- and two-stimulus choice playback experiments, we evaluated behavioral and physiological responses of females to male acoustic stimuli. Virgin females oriented to and approached speakers broadcasting male calls independent of caller identity, implying that females are generally attracted to male acoustic stimuli outside the context of a pair bond. When pair bonded females were presented with calls of a mate and a stranger, they showed a slight preference for calls of their mate. Moreover, behavioral responses varied with breeding status: females with eggs were faster to approach stimuli and spent more time in the mate arm than females that were pair bonded but did not currently have eggs. Our study suggests a potential role for individual vocal recognition in the formation and maintenance of pair bonds in a poison frog and raises new questions about how acoustic signals are perceived in the context of monogamy and biparental care.",

    "abstract": "Reproduction poses a substantial burden, especially for mammalian females. Puberty onset serves as a vital checkpoint, regulated based on the bodys energy state, to prevent inappropriate reproductive activity under malnutrition. However, the neural basis of this puberty checkpoint remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that peripubertal malnutrition in female mice reduces the synchronous activity episodes of arcuate kisspeptin neurons (SEskiss), which are critical regulators of the gonadotropin axis. Improved dietary availability boosts SEskiss frequency, facilitating puberty onset. Using a viral-genetic approach, we show that the activating agouti-related protein neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARCAgrp neurons), a hunger center, suppresses SEskiss, even with enough food. Conversely, loss-of-function of ARCAgrp neurons enhances SEskiss during malnutrition, partly promoting irregular sexual maturation. Collectively, a neural circuit connecting feeding to reproductive centers is responsible for disinhibiting SEskiss frequency based on dietary availability, which sheds light on the neural basis of puberty checkpoint.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe pulsatile activity of arcuate kisspeptin neurons emerges and grows before vaginal opening.\nC_LIO_LIPubertal impairment resulting from malnutrition is associated with a reduction in the pulsatile activity of kisspeptin neurons.\nC_LIO_LIPubertal recovery by food availability follows the elevated pulsatile activity of kisspeptin neurons during catch-up growth.\nC_LIO_LIThe arcuate Agrp neurons suppress the frequency of pulsatile activity of kisspeptin neurons under negative energy balance.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Background and aimThe lack of standardization and scientific validation of the use of most plant extracts leads to toxicity problems. The stem bark extract of Annickia polycarpa has been shown to possess antioxidant, antidiabetic, analgesic, and anti-colitis effects. However, nothing is known about the effects of the prolonged use of the extract. Thus, we investigated the acute and sub-chronic toxicity of the aqueous stem bark extract of (APE) in Sprague-Dawley rats.\n\nExperimental procedureThe LD50 and sub-chronic toxicity of APE (20 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, and 500 mg/kg) was studied over 3 months in Sprague-Dawley rats. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT), direct bilirubin and creatinine were measured after 3 months of treatment. Hematological analysis and urinalysis were also performed. Also, the effect of APE on blood clotting time and pentobarbital-induced sleeping time were determined at the termination of treatment. Finally, histological analysis was done on liver, kidney, lung, and heart after hematoxylin-eosin staining of tissue cross-sections at the termination of treatment.\n\nResults and conclusionThe LD50 of APE in rats was higher than 5000 mg/kg with no observable signs of toxicity. APE also showed no hematotoxic effect when used consistently for 3 months. Additionally, APE had no adverse effect on the liver and kidney evidenced by a lack of effect on serum biochemical parameters (ALP, ALT, direct bilirubin, and creatinine), urinalysis as well as the tissue morphology of these organs. No adverse morphological effects were also observed with the heart muscle cells. However, APE showed mild selective toxicity to the lung characterized by alveolar space closing and interstitial fibrosis and alveolar septa thickening. These results indicate that APE is generally non-toxic at the tested doses but shows mild selective pneumotoxicity when used over a long period of time.",

    "abstract": "Functional Ultrasound Imaging (fUSI) is an emerging hemodynamic-based functional neuroimaging technique that combines high spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity, as well as extensive brain coverage, enabling a range of applications in both control and disease animal models. Based on power Doppler (pD) imaging, fUSI measures changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) by detecting the back-scattered echoes from red blood cells moving within its field of view (FOV). However, the expansion of fUSI technology is partly limited by the challenge to co-register pD vascular maps acquired across different sessions or animals to one reference; an approach that could widen the scope of experimental paradigms and enable advanced data analysis tools. In this study, we seek to address this critical limitation. We evaluate six image registration techniques, predominantly used in other neuroimaging studies, using 2D sagittal whole-brain fUSI data from 82 anesthetized mice, and tested the quality of registration using multiple metrics. Our findings indicate a substantial enhancement in the alignment of fUSI images post registration. Among the tested techniques, the non-rigid registration algorithm Imregdeform yielded superior performance. We offer the first comparative study of image registration techniques for a 2D fUSI brain dataset, paving a way for improved utilization of fUSI in future pre-clinical research applications.",

    "abstract": "T cells help orchestrate immune responses to pathogens, and their aberrant regulation can trigger autoimmunity. Recent studies highlight that a threshold number of T cells (a quorum) must be activated in a tissue to mount a functional immune response. These collective effects allow the T cell repertoire to respond to pathogens while suppressing autoimmunity due to circulating autoreactive T cells. Our computational studies show that increasing numbers of pathogenic peptides targeted by T cells during persistent or severe viral infections increase the probability of activating T cells that are weakly reactive to self-antigens (molecular mimicry). These T cells are easily re-activated by the self-antigens and contribute to exceeding the quorum threshold required to mount autoimmune responses. Rare peptides that activate many T cells are sampled more readily during severe/persistent infections than in acute infections, which amplifies these effects. Experiments in mice to test predictions from these mechanistic insights are suggested.",

Differentially expressed proteins between nutrient replete and depleted conditions were enriched to identify proteins involved in nutrient uptake. We demonstrate cell surface localization of seven new proteins using immunofluorescence and show that overexpression of the proteins LpqY and ProX leads to hypersensitivity towards streptomycin, while expression of SubI, FecB2, and Rv0999 exhibited higher membrane permeability, assessed through EtBr accumulation assay. Further, proton NMR metabolomics suggests the role of four outer membrane proteins in glycerol uptake.

    "abstract": "LC8 is a eukaryotic hub protein that presents a highly conserved interface recognized by short linear motifs (SLiMs) in partner proteins. LC8 was originally associated with the dynein motor complex and was also suggested to promote dimerization of partner proteins. However, the growing list of validated partners with diverse functions suggests that LC8 plays a more general cellular role which is still not fully understood. In this work, we combined computational and experimental approaches in order to gain insights into the LC8 interaction network at the system level. Our machine-learning based pipeline together with functional enrichment analysis revealed that LC8 plays a central role in the ciliary-centrosomal system with several partners involved in various types of ciliopathies. By integrating proteomic data and functional annotations, we identified a high confidence, ciliary-centrosomal specific LC8 partner list of 57 proteins, 15 of which are central to centriole life-cycle organization. Validated binding motifs and the detailed characterization of the interaction with protein OFD1 emphasized the important role of LC8, which was confirmed by confocal microscopy. OFD1, which is a central player in this system, also stood out as an early and highly conserved LC8 partner. However, additional partners showed a more recent evolutionary origin featuring novel proteins as well as novel motifs. Altogether, our results highlight that LC8 plays a major role in the ciliary-centrosomal system and its interaction network underwent a major expansion. This system driven motif evolution contributed to the increased complexity of the organization and regulation of the ciliary-centrosomal system.",

    "abstract": "Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) are commonly analyzed through genomic profiling, which does not capture posttranslational and functional alterations of encoded proteins. To address this limitation, we developed ZeptoCTC, a single-cell protein analysis workflow that combines established technologies for single-cell isolation and sensitive Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) analysis to assess multiple protein expression and activation in individual CTCs. The workflow involves single cell labeling, isolation, lysis, and printing of the true single cell lysates onto a ZeptoChip using a modified micromanipulator CellCelectorTM. Subsequently, the printed lysates undergo fluorescence immunoassay RPPA protein detection using a ZeptoReader followed by signal quantification with Image J software. ZeptoCTC was successfully optimized, beginning with the measurement of EpCAM protein expression--a standard marker for CTC detection. As expected, mean fluorescence signals for EpCAM levels were significantly higher in single MCF-7 cells compared to MDA-MB-231 cells. Next, Capivasertib-treated MCF-7 cells exhibited an approximately 2-fold increase in the pAkt/Akt ratio compared to non-treated control cells. This finding was consistent with a co-performed western blot analysis of pooled MCF-7 cells. Application of ZeptoCTC to the analysis of single CTCs derived from a metastasized breast cancer (MBC) patient indicated a significantly higher level of pAkt, accompanied by a corresponding increase in pErk level when compared to patient-matched WBC. Finally, the current workflow successfully indicated the detectable pAkt and Akt signal difference in CTCs from two MBC patients: one with an Akt1 wild-type genotype, and the other harboring approximately 80% Akt1(E17K) mutated CTCs. The mutated CTCs revealed clearly elevated pAkt levels (1.8-fold), along with an even more strongly elevated total Akt (3.4-fold) when compared to the respective signals measured in wild-type CTCs. In conclusion, ZeptoCTC is a highly sensitive method for measuring the expression and phosphorylation of treatment-relevant proteins in key cancer-driving signaling pathways from true single cell samples.",

Here, we report the identification of a CDK6-driven mechanism of cell cycle progression deregulation directly involved in EC proliferation and HHT vascular pathology. Specifically, HHT mouse liver ECs exhibited defects in their cell cycle control characterized by a G1/S checkpoint bypass and acceleration of cell cycle speed. Phosphorylated retinoblastoma (p-RB1)--a marker of G1/S transition through the restriction point--significantly accumulated in ECs of HHT mouse retinal AVMs and HHT patient skin telangiectasias. Mechanistically, ALK1 loss of function increased the expression of key restriction point mediators, and treatment with palbociclib or ribociclib, two CDK4/6 inhibitors, blocked p-RB1 increase and retinal AVMs in HHT mice. Palbociclib also improved vascular pathology in the brain and slowed down endothelial cell cycle speed and EC proliferation. Specific deletion of Cdk6 in ECs was sufficient to protect HHT mice from AVM pathology. Thus, CDK6-mediated endothelial cell cycle acceleration controls EC proliferation in AVMs and is a central determinant of HHT pathogenesis. We propose that clinically approved CDK4/6 inhibitors have repurposing potential in HHT.",

    "abstract": "Over 80% of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) carry the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride ion channel at the apical plasma membrane (PM) of epithelial cells. F508del impairs CFTR folding causing it to be destroyed by endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD). Small molecule correctors, which act as pharmacological chaperones to divert CFTR-F508del from ERAD, are the primary strategy for treating CF, yet corrector development continues with only a rudimentary understanding of how ERAD targets CFTR-F508del. We conducted genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens to systematically identify the molecular machinery that underlies CFTR-F508del ERAD. Although the ER-resident ubiquitin ligase, RNF5 was the top E3 hit, knocking out RNF5 only modestly reduced CFTR-F508del degradation. Sublibrary screens in an RNF5 knockout background identified RNF185 as a redundant ligase, demonstrating that CFTR-F508del ERAD is highly buffered. Gene-drug interaction experiments demonstrated that correctors tezacaftor (VX-661) and elexacaftor (VX-445) stabilize sequential, RNF5-resistant folding states. We propose that binding of correctors to nascent CFTR-F508del alters its folding landscape by stabilizing folding states that are not substrates for RNF5-mediated ubiquitylation.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTO_LIClinically effective small molecule cystic fibrosis (CF) correctors divert mutant CFTR molecules from ER-associated degradation (ERAD).

    "abstract": "Different forms of dementia are caused by stop-loss mutations in the ITM2B gene which result in the expression of 34 AA long peptides that accumulate as amyloids in human brains. In order to gather mechanistic insights into the formation of amyloids by two of these peptides, ADan and ABri - hallmarks of Danish and British dementia respectively - we employed saturation mutagenesis combined to a massively parallel selection assay that reports on amyloid nucleation. Our results reveal that ADan aggregates into amyloids remarkably faster than both the unextended peptide Bri2 and the extended ABri sequence. The complete mutational landscape of ADan reveals asparagines and charged residues as key players in the nucleation process in addition to aliphatic residues within positions 20-25. What is more, we show that extending Bri2 with just two specific residues is enough to generate a novel amyloid core which we suggest builds the structured core of ADan fibrils. On the other hand, only a handful of mutations can boost the ability of ABri to nucleate amyloids, including a SNV replacing the Bri2 stop codon by a Cys codon. Overall, the remarkably different aggregation profiles and mutational landscapes for the two peptides suggest that different disease mechanisms underlie disease in Danish and British dementia and highlight the importance of accurately measuring the impact of stop extension mutations for these and other sequences across the genome.",

    "abstract": "The hallmarks of chromosome organization in multicellular eukaryotes are chromosome territories (CT), chromatin compartments, and different types of domains, including topologically associated domains (TADs). Yet, most of these concepts derive from analyses of organisms with monocentric chromosomes. Here we describe the 3D genome architecture of an organism with holocentric chromosomes, the silkworm Bombyx mori. At the genome-wide scale, B. mori chromosomes form highly separated territories and lack substantial trans contacts. As described in other eukaryotes, B. mori chromosomes segregate into an active A and an inactive B compartment. Remarkably, we also identify a third compartment, Secluded \"S\", with a unique contact pattern. Compartment S shows strong enrichment of short-range contacts and depletion of long-range contacts. It hosts a unique combination of genetic and epigenetic features, localizes at the periphery of CTs and shows developmental plasticity. Biophysical modeling shows that formation of such secluded domains requires a new mechanism - a high density of extruded loops within them along with low level of extrusion and compartmentalization of A and B. Together with other evidence of loop extrusion in interphase, this suggests SMC-mediated loop extrusion in this insect. Overall, our analyses highlight the evolutionary plasticity of 3D genome organization driven by a new combination of known processes.",

    "abstract": "Targeted protein degradation (TPD) represents a potent chemical biology paradigm that leverages the cellular degradation machinery to pharmacologically eliminate specific proteins of interest. Although multiple E3 ligases have been discovered to facilitate TPD, there exists a compelling requirement to diversify the pool of E3 ligases available for such applications. This expansion will broaden the scope of potential protein targets, accommodating those with varying subcellular localizations and expression patterns. In this study, we describe a CRISPR-based transcriptional activation screen focused on human E3 ligases, with the goal of identifying E3 ligases that can facilitate heterobifunctional compound-mediated target degradation. This approach allows us to address the limitations associated with investigating candidate degrader molecules in specific cell lines that either lack or have low levels of the desired E3 ligases. Through this approach, we identified a candidate proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), 22-SLF, that induces the degradation of FKBP12 when the FBXO22 gene transcription is activated. 22-SLF induced the degradation of endogenous FKBP12 in a FBXO22-dependent manner across multiple cancer cell lines. Subsequent mechanistic investigations revealed that 22-SLF interacts with C227 and/or C228 in FBXO22 to achieve the target degradation. Finally, we demonstrated the versatility of FBXO22-based PROTACs by effectively degrading another endogenous protein BRD4. This study uncovers FBXO22 as an E3 ligase capable of supporting ligand-induced protein degradation through electrophilic PROTACs. The platform we have developed can readily be applied to elucidate protein degradation pathways by identifying E3 ligases that facilitate either small molecule-induced or endogenous protein degradation.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical energy, specifically in the form of ultrasound, can induce pressure variations and temperature fluctuations when applied to an aqueous media. These conditions can both positively and negatively affect protein complexes, influencing their stability, folding patterns, and self-assembling behavior. Regarding understanding the effects of ultrasound on the self-assembly of amyloidogenic proteins, our knowledge remains quite limited. In our recent work, we established the boundary conditions under which sound energy can either cause damage or induce only negligible changes in the structure of protein species. In the present study, we demonstrate that when the delivered ultrasonic energy is sufficiently low, it can induce refolding of specific motifs in protein monomers, as it has been revealed by MD, which is sufficient for primary nucleation, characterized by adopting a hydrogen-bonded {beta}-sheet-rich structure. These structural changes are initiated by pressure perturbations and are accelerated by a temperature factor. Furthermore, the prolonged action of low-amplitude ultrasound enables the elongation of amyloid protein nanofibrils directly from monomeric lysozyme proteins, in a controlled manner, until they reach a critical length. Using solution X-ray scattering, we determined that nanofibrillar assemblies, formed under the influence of ultrasound energy and natively fibrillated lysozyme, share identical structural characteristics. Thus, these results contribute to our understanding of the effects of ultrasound on fibrillar protein self-assembly and lay the foundation for the potential exploitation of sound energy in a protein chemistry environment.",

T-cell activation is elicited by the binding of the T-cell receptor (TCR) to epitopes displayed on MHC molecules, and the TCR specificity is determined by the sequence of its  and {beta} chains. Here, we collected and curated a dataset of 17,715 {beta}TCRs interacting with dozens of class I and class II epitopes. We used this curated data to develop MixTCRpred, a deep learning TCR-epitope interaction predictor. MixTCRpred accurately predicts TCRs recognizing several viral and cancer epitopes. MixTCRpred further provides a useful quality control tool for multiplexed single-cell TCR sequencing assays of epitope-specific T cells and pinpoints a substantial fraction of putative contaminants in public databases. Analysis of epitope-specific dual  T cells demonstrates that MixTCRpred can identify  chains mediating epitope recognition. Applying MixTCRpred to TCR repertoires from COVID-19 patients reveals enrichment of clonotypes predicted to bind an immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 epitope. Overall, MixTCRpred provides a robust tool to predict TCRs interacting with specific epitopes and interpret TCR-sequencing data from both bulk and epitope-specific T cells.",

However, there is a lack of methods for systematically measuring, categorizing, and diagnosing reference bias. We present biastools, which analyzes and categorizes instances of reference bias. Biastools has different sets of functionality tailored to different scenarios, i.e. (a) when the donor genome is well-characterized and input reads are simulated, (b) when the donor is well-characterized and reads are real, and (c) when the donor is not well-characterized and reads are real. When possible, biastools divides instances of reference bias into categories according to their cause: bias due to loss, flux, or local misalignment. Biastoolss scan mode detects large-scale mapping artifacts due to structural variation and flaws in the reference representation. Our findings confirm that including more variants in a graph genome alignment method results in fewer reference biases. We also find that end-to-end alignment modes are effective in reducing bias at insertions and deletions, compared to local aligners that allow soft clipping. Finally, we use biastools to characterize the ways in which using the new telomere-to-telomere human reference can improve bias at a large scale. In short, biastools is a tool uniquely focused on reference bias, making it a valuable resource as the field continues to develop new aligners and pangenome representations to reduce bias.",

    "abstract": "For eukaryotic cells to heal wounds, respond to immune signals, or metastasize, they must migrate, often by adhering to extracellular matrix. Cells may also secrete matrix factors, leaving behind a footprint that influences their crawling. Recent experiments showed that epithelial cells on micropatterned adhesive stripes move persistently in regions they have previously crawled over, where footprints have been formed, but barely advance into unexplored regions, creating an oscillatory migration of increasing amplitude. Here, we explore through mathematical modeling how footprint secretion and cell responses to footprint combine to allow cells to develop oscillation and other complex migratory motions. We simulate cell crawling with a phase field model coupled to a biochemical model of cell polarity, assuming local contact with the secreted footprint activates Rac1, a polarity protein at the front of the cell. Depending on the footprint secretion rate and the response to the footprint, cells on micropatterned lines can display a variety of types of motility, including confined, oscillatory, and persistent motion. On 2D substrates, we predict a transition between cells undergoing circular motion and cells developing a more exploratory phenotype. Our model shows how minor changes in a cells interaction with its footprint can completely alter exploration, allowing cells to tightly regulate their motion, as well as leading to a wide spectrum of behaviors when secretion or sensing is variable from cell to cell. Consistent with our computational predictions, we find in earlier experimental data evidence of cells undergoing both circular and exploratory motion. Our work proposes a new paradigm for how cells regulate their own motility.",

    "abstract": "Relapse-specific mutations do not account for all chemotherapy failures in patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). By mining RNA-seq datasets of paired diagnostic/relapse pediatric B-ALL samples, we discovered pervasive aberrant splicing (AS) patterns linked with relapse. They affected drivers of resistance to glucocorticoids, anti-folates, and thiopurines. Most splicing variations represent exon skipping, \"poison\" exon inclusion, and intron retention, phenocopying well-documented loss-of-function mutations. In addition, relapse-associated AS of NT5C2 mRNA yields an isoform with a cryptic 24-nt in-frame exon 6a. Inclusion of the extra 8 amino acids into this enzyme results in elevated nucleosidase activity, a known consequence of gain-of-function mutations in NT5C2 and a common determinant of 6-mercaptopurine resistance. Furthermore, in B-ALL cells NT5C2ex6a and the R238W hotspot variant confers comparable levels of resistance to 6-mercaptopurine in vitro and in vivo. These results support a role for alternative splicing as a prevalent mechanism driving chemotherapy resistance in relapsed B-ALL.\n\nStatement of significanceMutations in chemoresistance genes are found in relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, in this low-mutational-burden disease, up to 30% of cases have no known relapse-specific genetic alterations.

Using in vitro cytotoxicity assays, and a humanized mouse model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we show that RapaR-CAR-T cells can efficiently target CD19+ leukemia cells in presence of rapamycin. Furthermore, our strategy allows multiplexed targeting of rapamycin-regulated immunoreceptors complexes (DARICs) to the MTOR and TRAC loci to pharmacologically control CAR-T cells activity. We foresee that our approach could both facilitate the enrichment of CRISPR-engineered CAR-T cells ex vivo and in vivo while improving tumor eradication.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear speckles are membrane-less bodies within the cell nucleus enriched in RNA biogenesis, processing, and export factors. In this study we investigated speckle phenotype variation in human cancer, finding a reproducible speckle signature, based on RNA expression of speckle-resident proteins, across >20 cancer types. Of these, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) exhibited a clear correlation between the presence of this speckle expression signature, imaging-based speckle phenotype, and clinical outcomes. ccRCC is typified by hyperactivation of the HIF-2 transcription factor, and we demonstrate here that HIF-2 drives physical association of a select subset of its target genes with nuclear speckles. Disruption of HIF-2-driven speckle association via deletion of its speckle targeting motifs (STMs)--defined in this study--led to defective induction of speckle-associating HIF-2 target genes without impacting non-speckle-associating HIF-2 target genes. We further identify the RNA export complex, TREX, as being specifically altered in speckle signature, and knockdown of key TREX component, ALYREF, also compromises speckle-associated gene expression. By integrating tissue culture functional studies with tumor genomic and imaging analysis, we show that HIF-2 gene regulatory programs are impacted by specific manipulation of speckle phenotype and by abrogation of speckle targeting abilities of HIF-2. These findings suggest that, in ccRCC, a key biological function of nuclear speckles is to modulate expression of a specific subset of HIF-2-regulated target genes that, in turn, influence patient outcomes. We also identify STMs in other transcription factors, suggesting that DNA-speckle targeting may be a general mechanism of gene regulation.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS- Nuclear speckles shown to reproducibly vary in cancer, predicting patient survival in ccRCC\n- HIF-2 drives DNA/gene-speckle contacts dependent on identified speckle targeting motifs within HIF-2\n- Putative speckle targeting motifs are highly enriched among regulators of gene expression\n- Partitioning of transcription factor functional programs may be a major biological function of nuclear speckles",

Nevertheless, cancer cells can exploit this process for their own proliferative advantage. In our study, we generated mixed murine organoids and microtissues to explore the impact of cell competition on liver metastasis. Unlike competition at the primary site, the initial effect on liver progenitor cells does not involve the induction of apoptosis. Instead, metastatic competition manifests as a multistage process. Initially, liver progenitors undergo compaction, which is followed by cell cycle arrest, ultimately forcing differentiation. Subsequently, the newly differentiated liver cells exhibit reduced cellular fitness, rendering them more susceptible to outcompetion by intestinal cancer cells. Notably, cancer cells leverage different interactions with different epithelial populations in the liver, using them as scaffolds to facilitate their growth. Consequently, tissue-specific mechanisms of cell competition are fundamental in driving metastatic intestinal cancer.",

    "abstract": "Residual force depression (rFD) following active muscle shortening is commonly assumed to strongly and linearly increase with increasing muscle work, but this has not been systematically tested during voluntary contractions in humans. Using dynamometry, we compared steady-state ankle joint torques (N=16) following tibialis anterior (TA) muscle-tendon unit (MTU) lengthening and shortening to the torque during submaximal voluntary fixed-end dorsiflexion reference contractions (REF) at a matched MTU length and EMG amplitude. B-mode ultrasound revealed that TA fascicle shortening amplitudes were significantly reduced (p<0.001) during MTU lengthening with no preload over small (LENsmall) and medium (LENmedium) amplitudes, respectively, relative to REF. MTU lengthening with a preload over a large (LENlargeP) amplitude significantly (p<0.001) increased fascicle shortening relative to REF, as well as stretch amplitudes relative to LENsmall and LENmedium (p[&le;]0.001), but the significant (p[&le;]0.028) steady-state fascicle force enhancement relative to REF was similar to LENsmall and LENmedium (3-5%). MTU shortening with and without a preload over small (SHOsmallP/SHOsmall) and large (SHOlargeP/SHOlarge) amplitudes significantly (p<0.001) increased positive fascicle and MTU work relative to REF, but significant (p[&le;]0.006) rFD was observed in SHOsmallP and SHOlargeP (7-10%) only. rFD was linearly related to positive MTU work (rrm(47)=0.48, p<0.001), but not positive fascicle work (rrm(47)=0.16, p=0.277). Our findings indicate that MTU lengthening without substantial fascicle stretch enhances steady-state force output, which might be due to less shortening-induced rFD. Our findings also indicate that different amounts of positive fascicle and MTU work induce similar rFD, which cautions against using work to predict rFD during submaximal voluntary contractions.",

IMPRINT utilizes TXTL to express DNA methyltransferases from the bacterial hosts restriction-modification systems. The expressed methyltransferases then methylate DNA in vitro to match the host DNAs methylation pattern, circumventing restriction and enhancing transformation. With IMPRINT, we efficiently multiplex methylation by diverse DNA methyltransferases and enhance plasmid transformation in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. We also developed a high-throughput pipeline that identifies the most consequential methyltransferases, and we apply IMPRINT to facilitate a library screen for translational rules in a hard-to-transform Bifidobacterium.

We developed a score integrating model simulation results to predict the type (competition, neutralism, mutualism) and quantify the interaction between several organisms.

In mice, {gamma}{delta} T cells can largely be segregated into CD27+ and CD27- cells, and their functions are modulated by interactions with surrounding cells. However, which cells communicate directly with {gamma}{delta} T cells in lung adenocarcinoma remains unknown. To address this, we combined flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and scRNA-seq, using an autochthonous genetically engineered mouse model and different {gamma}{delta} T cell-deficient settings. We found that {gamma}{delta} T cells were increased in tumour-bearing lungs, with an altered phenotype. CD27- and CD27+ {gamma}{delta} T cells differed in their localisation and interactions including their tropism for macrophages.

Mice with T cell-specific deletion of Prdm-1, Maf or the combination of both transcription factors did not develop inflammatory intestinal pathologies at the steady state. Double deficient Prdm1fl/flMaffl/flCd4Cre mice infected with Helicobacter hepaticus developed severe colitis with a major increase in TH1/NK/ILC1 effector genes in lamina propria leucocytes (LPLs), while Prdm1fl/flCd4Cre and Maffl/flCd4Cre mice showed mild/moderate pathology and a less-marked Type I effector response.

We showed NK cells are common constituents in the tissue of skin cancers including basal cell carcinoma (BCC), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), extramammary paget disease (EMPD) and acral melanoma (aMM). scRNA-Seq revealed an inter and intra-tumor transcriptional heterogeneity of NK cells dependent on different skin TMEs. Unexpectedly, compared to peri-tumor, skin tumor NK cells down regulated the production of anti-tumor cytokines, IFN-{gamma} and TNF-, and up regulated the production of amphiregulin (AREG), a ligand of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which functions in promoting skin tumor growth and mediating immune tolerance. Mechanistically, skin TME upregulated NK cell glucocorticoid receptor (GR, NR3C1) activity, which specifically induced NK cell AREG production, and switched the anti-tumor characteristics of NK cells to a homeostatic feature. NR3C1 knockout or GR inhibitor abolished NK cell AREG production. Finally, we showed primary GR activation induced a memory response of AREG production by NK cells upon secondary stimuli, however pro-inflammatory cytokine induced memory response of IFN-{gamma} production was inhibited by GR activation.

B cell proliferation requires nutrients to support the anabolism inherent in clonal expansion. Glucose usage by GC B cells has been reported to contribute little to their energy needs, with questions raised as to whether or not glucose uptake or glycolysis increases in GC B cells compared to their naive precursors. Indeed, metabolism can be highly flexible, such that supply shortage along one pathway may be compensated by increased flux on others. We now show that elimination of the glucose transporter GLUT1 after establishment of a pre-immune B cell repertoire, even after initiation of the GC B cell gene expression program, decreased initial GC B cell population numbers, affinity maturation, and PC outputs. Glucose oxidation was heightened in GC B cells, but this hexose flowed more into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), whose activity was important in controlling reactive oxygen (ROS) and ASC production. In modeling how glucose usage by B cells promotes the Ab response, the control of ROS appeared insufficient. Surprisingly, the combination of galactose, which mitigated ROS, with provision of mannose - an efficient precursor to glycosylation - supported robust production of and normal Ab secretion by ASC under glucose-free conditions. Collectively, the findings indicate that GC depend on normal glucose influx, especially in PC production, but reveal an unexpected metabolic flexibility in hexose requirements.\n\nKEY POINTSO_LIGlucose influx is critical for GC homeostasis, affinity maturation and the generation of Ab-secreting cells.\nC_LIO_LIPlasma cell development uses the Pentose Phosphate Pathway, and hexose sugars maintain redox homeostasis.\nC_LIO_LIPCs can develop and achieve robust Ab secretion in the absence of glucose using a combination of hexose alternatives.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The complement system is an innate immune mechanism against microbial infection. It involves a cascade of effector molecules that is activated via classical, lectin and alternative pathways. Consequently, many pathogens bind to or incorporate in their structures host negative regulators of the complement pathways as an evasion mechanism. Factor H (FH) is a negative regulator of the complement alternative pathway that protects \"self\" cells of the host from non-specific complement attack. Viruses including human influenza A viruses (IAVs) have been shown to bind to FH. Here we show that IAVs of both human and avian origin can bind directly to human FH and the interaction is mediated via the IAV surface glycoprotein haemagglutinin (HA). HA bound to common pathogen binding footprints on the FH structure, complement control protein modules, CCP 5-7 and CCP 15-20. The FH binding to H1 and H3 showed that the interaction overlapped with the receptor binding site of both HAs but the footprint was more extensive for the H3 HA than the H1 HA. The HA - FH interaction impeded the initial entry of H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains but its impact on viral multicycle replication in human lung cells was strain specific. The H3N2 virus binding to cells was significantly inhibited by preincubation with FH, whereas there was no alteration in replicative rate and progeny virus release for human H1N1 or avian H9N2 and H5N3 IAV strains. We have mapped the interaction between IAV and FH, the significance of which for the virus or host is yet to be elucidated.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, numerous hospitals have linked patient infections to Klebsiella pneumoniae producing Enterobacterales (KPCE) and other resistant bacterial species in their wastewater systems and handwashing sinks. Wastewater plumbing provides a reservoir for bacteria, making them incredibly difficult to eliminate through traditional disinfection methods. Data suggests that patients become infected when bacteria grow or migrate up the proximal wastewater plumbing and into the sink basin, and are subsequently dispersed onto surrounding surfaces. Therefore, a novel electronic device was developed that acts at the highest risk area, just below the sink drain, to heat and dry out the biofilm and creating a biofilm barrier and prevent upward growth from the sink trap. The efficacy of the first prototype of a tailpiece heater (TPH) in preventing drain colonization was tested using GFP-expressing Escherichia coli (GFP-E. coli) as the challenge organism. In control sinks without the TPH, GFP-E. coli biofilm grew from the p-trap upwards to colonize the drain within 7 days. Sinks with a TPH set to 75{degrees}C were found to prevent sink drain colonization. In contrast, 65{degrees}C was not adequate to prevent drain colonization. Using KPCE the TPH was more effective than no heat control in preventing drain colonization in sinks over time. Lastly, when challenged with seeding from above, the TPH also effectively prevented KPCE colonization at the drain level. Heating of the tailpiece may offer a safe, effective, and economically attractive approach to preventing the spread of resistant bacterial species from contaminated drain biofilm to patients.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum, the malaria-causing parasite, is a leading cause of infection-induced deaths worldwide. The preferred treatment approach is artemisinin-combination therapy, which couples fast-acting artemisinin derivatives with longer-acting drugs like lumefantrine, mefloquine, and amodiaquine. However, the urgency for new treatments has risen due to the parasites growing resistance to existing therapies. Our study shows that a common characteristic of the P. falciparum proteome - stretches of poly-lysine residues such as those found in proteins related to adhesion and pathogenicity - can serve as an effective peptide treatment for infected erythrocytes. A single dose of these poly-basic peptides can successfully diminish parasitemia in human erythrocytes in vitro with minimal toxicity. The effectiveness of the treatment correlates with the length of the poly-lysine peptide, with 30 lysine peptides supporting the eradication of erythrocytic parasites within 72 hours. PEG-ylation of the poly-lysine peptides or utilizing poly-lysine dendrimers and polymers further increases parasite clearance efficiency and bolsters the stability of these potential new therapeutics. Lastly, our affinity pull-downs and mass-spectrometry identify P. falciparums outer membrane proteins as likely targets for polybasic peptide medications. Since poly-lysine dendrimers are already FDA-approved for drug delivery, their adaptation as antimalarial drugs presents a promising new therapeutic strategy.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryOur study demonstrates that poly-lysine peptides, particularly those modified through PEG-ylation or in the form of poly-lysine dendrimers, can effectively reduce Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, in human erythrocytes in vitro, with potential for use as a promising new antimalarial therapy.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP) strains poses a significant threat to public health due to their high mortality rates and propensity to cause severe community-acquired infections in otherwise healthy individuals. The ability of hvKP to form biofilms and produce a protective capsule contributes to its enhanced virulence and is a significant challenge to effective antibiotic treatment. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying hvKP virulence and biofilm formation is crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies. Polyphosphate Kinase 1 (PPK1) is an enzyme responsible for inorganic polyphosphate synthesis and plays a vital role in regulating various physiological processes in bacteria. In this study, we investigated the impact of polyP metabolism on the biofilm and capsule formation and virulence traits in hvKP using Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba as a model host. We found that the PPK1 null-mutant was impaired in biofilm and capsule formation and showed attenuated virulence in D. discoideum compared to the wild-type strain. We performed a shotgun proteomic analysis of the PPK1 mutant and wild-type strain to gain further insight into the underlying molecular mechanism. The results revealed that the PPK1 mutant had a differential expression of proteins (DEP) involved in capsule synthesis (Wzi - Ugd), biofilm formation (MrkC-D-H), synthesis of the colibactin genotoxin precursor (ClbB), as well as proteins associated with the synthesis and modification of lipid A (ArnB -LpxC - PagP). These proteomic findings corroborate the phenotypic observations and indicate that the PPK1 mutation is associated with impaired biofilm and capsule formation and attenuated virulence in hypervirulent K. pneumoniae. Overall, our study highlights the importance of polyP synthesis in regulating extracellular biomolecules and virulence in K. pneumoniae and provides insights into potential therapeutic targets for treating K. pneumoniae infections.",

    "abstract": "Xanthomonas translucens, the causal agent of bacterial leaf streak disease (BLS) in cereals, is a re-emerging pathogen that is becoming increasingly destructive across the world. While BLS has caused yield losses in the past, there is anecdotal evidence that newer isolates may be more virulent. We observed that two Xanthomonas translucens isolates collected from two sites in Colorado are more aggressive on current wheat and barley varieties compared to older isolates, and we hypothesize that genetic changes between recent and older isolates contribute to the differences in isolate aggressiveness. To test this, we phenotyped and genetically characterized two X. translucens isolates collected from Colorado in 2018, which we designated CO236 (from barley) and CO237 (from wheat). Using pathovar-specific phenotyping and PCR primers, we determined that CO236 belongs to pathovar translucens and CO237 belongs to pathovar undulosa. We sequenced the full genomes of the isolates using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing, and compared their whole genomes against published X. translucens genomes. This analysis confirmed our pathovar designations for Xtt CO236 and Xtu CO237, and showed that, at the whole-genome level, there were no obvious genomic structural changes between Xtt CO236 and Xtu CO237 and other respective published pathovar genomes. Focusing on pathovar undulosa (Xtu CO237), we then compared putative Type III effectors among all available Xtu isolate genomes and found that they were highly conserved. However, there were striking differences in the presence and sequence of various transcription activator-like effectors (TALE) between Xtu CO237 and published undulosa genomes, which correlate with isolate virulence. Here, we explore the potential implications of the differences in these virulence factors, and provide possible explanations for the increased virulence of recently-emerged isolates.\n\nData SummaryA list of all Xanthomonas accessions used in this study can be found in Supplemental Table S1. Xtt CO236 and Xtu CO237 genomic sequences are deposited in GenBank (Accession: PRJNA1017868 and PRJNA1017870, respectively). Software packages for the custom Conda environment used in this analysis can be found in Supplemental Table S4. The dataset from the MinION reads from CO236 and CO237 can be found in Dryad, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.d51c5b06q. Custom bash and Python scripts for the effector analysis are available in (https://github.com/robertslabcsu/xanthanalysis.git).\n\nImpact statementXanthomonas translucens is a destructive, re-emerging pathogen of cereal crops with no known resistance or methods for chemical control. Recent isolates have increased virulence compared to older isolates, which emphasizes the need to understand how virulence evolves, and how the pathogen interacts with its host, to find new ways to manage the disease. Here, we identify potential virulence factors that contribute to the increased aggressiveness observed in two recently collected Colorado isolates, with potential impacts on understanding pathogen host range and evolution.",

    "abstract": "The heart contracts incessantly and requires a constant supply of energy, utilizing numerous metabolic substrates such as fatty acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids to supply its high energy demands. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of various metabolites is urgently needed for understanding cardiac metabolism; however, complete metabolome analyses remain challenging due to the broad range of metabolite polarities which makes extraction and detection difficult. Herein, we implemented parallel metabolite extractions and high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods to obtain a comprehensive analysis of the human heart metabolome. To capture the diverse range of metabolite polarities, we first performed six parallel liquid-liquid extractions (three monophasic, two biphasic, and one triphasic extractions) of healthy human donor heart tissue. Next, we utilized two complementary MS platforms for metabolite detection - direct-infusion ultrahigh-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (DI-FTICR) and high-resolution liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight tandem MS (LC-Q-TOF MS/MS). Using DI-FTICR MS, 9,521 metabolic features were detected where 7,699 were assigned a chemical formula and 1,756 were assigned an annotated by accurate mass assignment. Using LC-Q-TOF MS/MS, 21,428 metabolic features were detected where 626 metabolites were identified based on fragmentation matching against publicly available libraries. Collectively, 2276 heart metabolites were identified in this study which span a wide range of polarities including polar (benzenoids, alkaloids and derivatives and nucleosides) as well as non-polar (phosphatidylcholines, acylcarnitines, and fatty acids) compounds. The results of this study will provide critical knowledge regarding the selection of appropriate extraction and MS detection methods for the analysis of the diverse classes of human heart metabolites.\n\nTable of Contents Graphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/558013v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1db91c8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@400d81org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@136b221org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e8d3b9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Using axenic or conventional breeding conditions, we found only traces of 6mA by LC-MS/MS and no significant increase in 6mA levels in the absence of TET.

    "abstract": "pre-mRNA splicing is a critical feature of eukaryotic gene expression. Many eukaryotes use cis-splicing to remove intronic sequences from pre-mRNAs. In addition to cis-splicing, many organisms use trans-splicing to replace the 5' ends of mRNAs with a non-coding spliced-leader RNA. Both cis- and trans-splicing rely on accurately recognising splice site sequences by spliceosomal U snRNAs and associated proteins. Spliceosomal snRNAs carry multiple RNA modifications with the potential to affect different stages of pre-mRNA splicing. Here, we show that m6A modification of U6 snRNA A43 by the RNA methyltransferase METT-10 is required for accurate and efficient cis- and trans-splicing of C. elegans pre-mRNAs. The absence of U6 snRNA m6A modification primarily leads to alternative splicing at 5' splice sites. Furthermore, weaker 5' splice site recognition by the unmodified U6 snRNA A43 affects splicing at 3' splice sites. U6 snRNA m6A43 and the splicing factor SNRNP27K function to recognise an overlapping set of 5' splice sites with an adenosine at +4 position. Finally, we show that U6 snRNA m6A43 is required for efficient SL trans-splicing at weak 3' trans-splice sites. We conclude that the U6 snRNA m6A modification is important for accurate and efficient cis- and trans-splicing in C. elegans.",

Although primitive HSPC numbers were stable during aging, overall cellularity was reduced, especially for erythroid and lymphoid lineages. Notably, HSPC from aged individuals had superior repopulating frequency than younger counterparts in xenografts; yet aged HSPC displayed epigenetic dysregulation of cell cycle, inflammatory signatures, and a reduced capacity to counteract activation-induced proliferative stress with concomitant accumulation of DNA damage and senescence-like features upon xenotransplantation. This phenotype was recapitulated by enforcing proliferative stress in vivo on cord blood (CB) HSPC. Overall, our work sheds light on dysregulated responses to activation-induced proliferation underlying HSPC aging and establishes CB xenotransplantation-based models as suitable for studying age-associated hematopoietic defects.",

    "abstract": "Evolution in a static environment, such as a laboratory setting with constant and uniform conditions, often proceeds via large-effect beneficial mutations that may become maladaptive in other environments. Conversely, natural settings require populations to endure environmental fluctuations. A sensible assumption is that the fitness of a lineage in a fluctuating environment is the time-average of its fitness over the sequence of static conditions it encounters. However, transitions between conditions may pose entirely new challenges, which could cause deviations from this time-average. To test this, we tracked hundreds of thousands of barcoded yeast lineages evolving in static and fluctuating conditions and subsequently isolated 900 mutants for pooled fitness assays in 15 environments. We find that fitness in fluctuating environments indeed often deviates from the expectation based on static components, leading to fitness non-additivity. Moreover, closer examination reveals that fitness in one component of a fluctuating environment is often strongly influenced by the previous component. We show that this environmental memory is especially common for mutants with high variance in fitness across tested environments, even if the components of the focal fluctuating environment are excluded from this variance. We employ a simple mathematical model and whole-genome sequencing to propose mechanisms underlying this effect, including lag time evolution and sensing mutations. Our results demonstrate that environmental fluctuations have large impacts on fitness and suggest that variance in static environments can explain these impacts.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary histories of species have been shaped by genomic, environmental, and morphological variation. Understanding the interactions among these sources of variation is critical to infer accurately the biogeographic history of lineages. Here, using the geographically widely distributed plum genus (Prunus, Rosaceae) as a model, we investigate how changes in genomic and environmental variation drove the diversification of this group, and we quantify the morphological features that facilitated or resulted from diversification. We sequenced 610 nuclear loci and complete chloroplast genomes from 75 species representing all major lineages in Prunus, with a special focus on the understudied tropical racemose group. The environmental variation in extant species was quantified by synthesizing bioclimatic variables into principal components of environmental variation using thousands of georeferenced herbarium specimens. We used machine learning algorithms to classify and measure morphological variation present in thousands of digitized herbarium sheet images. Our phylogenomic and biogeographic analyses revealed that ancient hybridization and/or allopolyploidy spurred the initial rapid diversification of the genus in the early Eocene, with subsequent diversification in the north temperate zone, Neotropics, and Paleotropics. This diversification involved successful transitions between tropical and temperate biomes, an exceedingly rare event in woody plant lineages, accompanied by morphological changes in leaf and reproductive morphology. The machine learning approach detected morphological variation associated with ancient hybridization and quantified the breadth of morphospace occupied by major lineages within the genus. The paleotropical lineages of Prunus have diversified steadily since the late Eocene/early Oligocene, while the neotropical lineages diversified much later. Critically, both the tropical and temperate lineages have continued to diversify. We conclude that the genomic rearrangements created by reticulation deep in the phylogeny of Prunus may explain why this group has been more successful than other groups with tropical origins that currently persist only in either tropical or temperate regions, but not both.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that microbial species have a strong within species genetic heterogeneity. This can be problematic for the analysis of prokaryote genomes, which commonly relies on a reference genome to guide the assembly process: any difference between reference and sample genomes can introduce errors in the detection of small insertions, deletions, structural variations and even point mutations. This phenomenon jeopardises the genomic surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, triggering even a reproducibility crisis. Here we present Hound, an analysis pipeline that integrates publicly available tools to locally assemble prokaryote genomes de novo, detect genes by similarity, and report the mutations found. Three features are exclusive to Hound: It reports relative gene copy number, retrieves sequences upstream the start codon to detect mutations in promoter regions, and, importantly, can merge contigs based on a user-given query sequence to reconstruct genes that are fragmented by the assembler. To demonstrate Hound, we screened through 5,032 bacterial whole-genome sequences isolated from farm animals and clinical patients using the amino acid sequence of blaTEM-1, to predict resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate. We believe this tool can facilitate the analysis of prokaryote species that currently lack a reference genome, and can be scaled up to build automated diagnostic systems.",

    "abstract": "Genetic factors play a significant role in the risk for development of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Using 3-bottle choice intermittent access ethanol (IEA), we have employed the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse panel as a model of alcohol use disorder in a genetically diverse population. Through use of gene expression network analysis techniques, in combination with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping, we have completed an extensive analysis of the influence of genetic background on gene expression changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This approach revealed that, in DO mice, genes whose expression was significantly disrupted by intermittent ethanol in the PFC also tended to be those whose expression correlated to intake. This finding is in contrast to previous studies of both mice and nonhuman primates. Importantly, these analyses identified genes involved in myelination in the PFC as significantly disrupted by IEA, correlated to ethanol intake, and having significant eQTLs. Genes that code for canonical components of the myelin sheath, such as Mbp, also emerged as key drivers of the gene expression response to intermittent ethanol drinking. Several regulators of myelination were also key drivers of gene expression, and had significant QTLs, indicating that genetic background may play an important role in regulation of brain myelination. These findings underscore the importance of disruption of normal myelination in the PFC in response to prolonged ethanol exposure, that genetic variation plays an important role in this response, and that this interaction between genetics and myelin disruption in the presence of ethanol may underlie previously observed behavioral changes under intermittent access ethanol drinking such as escalation of consumption.",

    "abstract": "Despite over a century of observations, the obligate insect parasites within the order Entomophthorales remain poorly characterized at the genetic level. This is in part due to their large genome sizes and difficulty in obtaining sequenceable material. In this manuscript, we leveraged a recently-isolated, laboratory-tractable Entomophthora muscae isolate and improved long-read sequencing to obtain a largely-complete entomophthoralean genome. Our E. muscae assembly is 1.03 Gb, consists of 7,810 contigs and contains 81.3% complete fungal BUSCOs. Using a comparative approach with other available (transcriptomic and genomic) datasets from entomophthoralean fungi, we provide new insight into the biology of these understudied pathogens. We offer a head-to-head comparison of morphological and molecular data for species within the E. muscae species complex. Our findings suggest that substantial taxonomic revision is needed to define species within this group and we provide recommendations for differentiating strains and species in the context of the existing body of E. muscae scientific literature. We show that giant genomes are the norm within Entomophthoraceae owing to extensive, but not recent, Ty3 retrotransposon activity, despite the presence of anti-transposable element defense machinery (RNAi). In addition, we find that E. muscae and its closest allies are enriched for M16A peptidases and possess genes that are likely homologs to the blue-light sensor white-collar 1, a Neurospora crassa gene that has a well-established role in maintaining circadian rhythms. We find that E. muscae has an expanded group of acid-trehalases, consistent with trehalose being the primary sugar component of fly (and insect) hemolymph. We uncover evidence that E. muscae diverged from other entomophthoralean fungi by expansion of existing families, rather than loss of particular domains, and possesses a potentially unique suite of secreted catabolic enzymes, consistent with E. muscaes species-specific, biotrophic lifestyle. Altogether, we provide a genetic and molecular foundation that we hope will provide a platform for the continued study of the unique biology of entomophthoralean fungi.",

    "abstract": "Transcription is the primary regulatory step in gene expression. Divergent transcription initiation from promoters and enhancers produces stable RNAs from genes and unstable RNAs from enhancers1-5. Nascent RNA capture and sequencing assays simultaneously measure gene and enhancer activity in cell populations6-9. However, fundamental questions in the temporal regulation of transcription and enhancer-gene synchrony remain unanswered primarily due to the absence of a single-cell perspective on active transcription. In this study, we present scGRO-seq - a novel single-cell nascent RNA sequencing assay using click-chemistry - and unveil the coordinated transcription throughout the genome. scGRO-seq demonstrates the episodic nature of transcription, and estimates burst size and frequency by directly quantifying transcribing RNA polymerases in individual cells. It reveals the co-transcription of functionally related genes and leverages the replication-dependent non-polyadenylated histone genes transcription to elucidate cell-cycle dynamics. The single-nucleotide spatial and temporal resolution of scGRO-seq identifies networks of enhancers and genes and indicates that the bursting of transcription at super-enhancers precedes the burst from associated genes. By imparting insights into the dynamic nature of transcription and the origin and propagation of transcription signals, scGRO-seq demonstrates its unique ability to investigate the mechanisms of transcription regulation and the role of enhancers in gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is an RNA surveillance mechanism that degrades transcripts containing premature termination codons. Alternative splicing (AS) is known to affect the expression levels of some human genes by producing transcripts rapidly degraded by NMD. However, the importance of AS in determining expression levels of most genes is unclear because rapidly degraded mRNA isoforms are difficult to quantify. To assess the impact of AS on gene expression levels, we analyzed population-scale data across eight molecular assays that capture gene regulation before, during, and after transcription and mRNA decay. Sequencing nascent RNA revealed that [~]15% of all mRNA molecules are NMD targets, of which most result from low-usage cryptic splicing. Leveraging genetic variation across cell lines, we find that trait-associated loci explained by AS are similarly likely to associate with NMD-induced expression level differences as with differences in protein isoform usage, suggesting that much of the impact of AS is mediated by NMD. Finally, we used the splice-switching drug risdiplam to perturb AS at hundreds of genes, finding that [~]3/4 of the splicing perturbations induce NMD. The remarkable prevalence of cryptic splice sites across the genome presents a rich opportunity for natural selection and therapeutics to shape the expression levels of nearly all human genes.",

    "abstract": "The heterohexameric AAA-ATPase Pex1/Pex6 is essential for the formation and maintenance of peroxisomes. Pex1/Pex6, similar to other AAA-ATPases, uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to mechanically thread substrate proteins through its central pore, thereby unfolding them. In related AAA-ATPase motors, substrates are recruited through binding to the motors N-terminal domains or N-terminally bound co-factors. Here we use structural and biochemical techniques to characterize the function of the N1 domain in Pex6 from budding yeast, S. cerevisiae. We found that although Pex1/{Lambda}N1-Pex6 is an active ATPase in vitro, it does not support Pex1/Pex6 function at the peroxisome in vivo. An X-ray crystal structure of the isolated Pex6 N1 domain shows that the Pex6 N1 domain shares the same fold as the N terminal domains of PEX1, CDC48, or NSF, despite poor sequence conservation. Integrating this structure with a cryo-EM reconstruction of Pex1/Pex6, AlphaFold2 predictions, and biochemical assays shows that Pex6 N1 mediates binding to both the peroxisomal membrane tether Pex15 and an extended loop from the D2 ATPase domain of Pex1 that influences Pex1/Pex6 heterohexamer stability. Given the direct interactions with both Pex15 and the D2 ATPase domains, the Pex6 N1 domain is poised to coordinate binding of co-factors and substrates with Pex1/Pex6 ATPase activity.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptomics, and in particular RNA-Seq, has become a widely used approach to assess the molecular state of biological systems. To facilitate its analysis, many tools have been developed for different steps, such as filtering lowly expressed genes, normalisation, differential expression, and enrichment. While numerous studies have examined the impact of method choices on differential expression results, little attention has been paid to their effects on further downstream functional analysis using enrichment of gene sets, such as pathways, which typically provides the basis for interpretation and follow-up experiments. To address this gap, we introduce FLOP (FunctionaL Omics Processing), a comprehensive nextflow-based workflow that combines various methods for preprocessing and downstream enrichment analysis, allowing users to perform end-to-end analyses of count level transcriptomic data. We illustrate FLOP capabilities on diverse datasets comprising samples from end-stage heart failure patients and cancer cell lines in both basal and drug-perturbed states. We found that the correlation between gene set enrichment analysis results can vary significantly for alternative pipelines. Additionally, we observed that not filtering the data had the highest impact on the correlation between pipelines in the gene set space, especially in settings with limited statistical power. Overall, our results underscore the impact of carefully evaluating the consequences of the choice of preprocessing methods on downstream enrichment analyses. We envision FLOP as a valuable tool to measure the robustness of functional analyses, ultimately leading to more reliable and conclusive biological findings.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=45 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/557538v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (14K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b35ee7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11bd02aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ff7b18org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ea8d2c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "An imbalance between suppressor and effector immune responses may preclude cure in chronic parasitic diseases. In the case of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, specialized regulatory Foxp3+ T (Treg) cells suppress protective type-1 effector responses. Herein, we investigated the kinetics and underlying mechanisms behind the regulation of protective parasite-specific CD8+ T cell immunity during acute T. cruzi infection. Using the DEREG mouse model, we found that Treg cells play a critical role during the initial stages after T. cruzi infection, subsequently influencing CD8+ T cells. Early Treg cell depletion increased the frequencies of polyfunctional short-lived, effector T cell subsets, without affecting memory precursor cell formation or the expression of activation markers. In addition, Treg cell depletion during early infection minimally affected the antigen-presenting cell response but it boosted CD4+ T cell responses before the development of anti-parasite effector CD8+ T cell responses. Crucially, the absence of CD39 expression on Treg cells significantly bolstered effector parasite-specific CD8+ T cell responses, leading to improved parasite control during T. cruzi infection. Our work underscores the crucial role of Treg cells in regulating protective anti-parasite immunity and provides evidence that CD39 expression by Treg cells represents a key immunomodulatory mechanism in this infection model.",
