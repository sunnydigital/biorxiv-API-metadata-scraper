    "abstract": "Introduction: Despite its complexity, deciphering nodal interaction is imperative to understanding a neural network. Network interaction is an even more complicated topic that must be addressed. This study aimed to examine the relationship between the brain waves of two canonical brain structures, i.e., the frontoparietal and limbic compartments, during a resting state. Methods: Electroencephalography (EEG) of 51 subjects in eye-closed condition was analyzed, and the eLORETA method was applied to convert the signals from the scalp to the brain. By way of community detection, representative neural nodes and the associated mean activities were retrieved. Total and lagged coherences were computed to indicate functional connectivity between those neural nodes. Two global network properties were elucidated based on the connectivity measures, i.e., global efficiency and mean functional connectivity strength. The temporal correlation of the global network indices between the two studied networks was explored. Results: It was found that there was a significant trend of positive correlation across the four metrics (lagged vs. total coherence x global efficiency vs. average connectivity). In other words, when the neural interaction in the FP network was stronger, so did that in the limbic network, and vice versa. Notably, the above interaction was not spectrally specific and only existed at a finer temporal scale (under hundreds of milliseconds level). Conclusion: The concordant change in network properties indicates an intricate balance between FP and LM compartments. Possible mechanisms and implications for the findings are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Goal-driven deep learning is increasingly used to supplement classical modeling approaches in computational neuroscience. The strength of deep neural networks lies in their ability to autonomously learn the connectivity required to solve complex and ecologically valid tasks, obviating the need for hand-engineered or hypothesis-driven connectivity patterns. Consequently, goal-driven models can generate hypotheses about the neurocomputations underlying cortical processing. Whereas goal-driven modeling is becoming increasingly common in perception neuroscience, its application to sensorimotor control is currently hampered by the complexity of the methods required to train models comprising the closed sensation-action loop. To mitigate this hurdle, we introduce AngoraPy, a modeling library that provides researchers with the tools to train complex recurrent convolutional neural networks that model sensorimotor systems.",

    "abstract": "During mammalian oocyte meiosis, spindle migration and asymmetric cytokinesis are unique steps for the successful polar body extrusion. The asymmetry defects of oocytes will lead to the failure of fertilization and embryo implantation. In present study we reported that an actin nucleating factor formin-like 2 (FMNL2) played critical roles in the regulation of spindle migration and organelle distribution. Our results showed that FMNL2 mainly localized at the oocyte cortex and periphery of spindle. Depletion of FMNL2 led to the failure of polar body extrusion and large polar bodies in oocytes. Live-cell imaging revealed that the spindle failed to migrate to the oocyte cortex, which caused polar body formation defects, and this might be due to the decreased polymerization of cytoplasmic actin by FMNL2 depletion. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis indicated that FMNL2 was associated with mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum-related proteins, and FMNL2 depletion disrupted the function and distribution of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, showing with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and the occurrence of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Microinjecting Fmnl2-EGFP mRNA into FMNL2-depleted oocytes significantly rescued these defects. Thus, our results indicate that FMNL2 is essential for the actin assembly, which further involves into meiotic spindle migration and ER/mitochondria functions in mouse oocytes.",

    "abstract": "When humans engage in joint action, they seem to so with an underlying sense of joint commitment, a feeling of mutual obligation towards their partner and a shared goal. Whether our closest living relatives, bonobos and chimpanzees, experience and understand joint commitment in the same way is subject to debate. Crucial evidence concerns how participants respond to interruptions of joint actions, particularly if they protest or attempt to reengage their reluctant or distracted partners. During dyadic interactions, bonobos and chimpanzees appear to have some sense of joint commitment, according to recent studies. Yet, data are inconsistent for triadic games with objects. We addressed this issue by engaging N=23 apes (5 adult chimpanzees, 5 infant bonobos, 13 adult bonobos) in a tug-of-war game with a human experimenter who abruptly stopped playing. Adult apes readily attempted to reengage the experimenter (>60% of subjects on first trial), with no group differences in the way of reengagement. Infant bonobos rarely reengaged and never did so on their first trial. Importantly, when infants reengaged passive partners, they mostly deployed (tactile) signals, yet rarely game-related behaviours (GRBs) as commonly observed in adults. These findings might explain negative results of earlier research. Bonobos and chimpanzees may thus have motivational foundations for joint commitment, although this capacity might develop over lifetime. We discuss this finding in relation to evolutionary and developmental theories on joint commitment.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal environment facilitates HIV-1 infection via mechanisms involving the gut-homing elixir retinoic acid (RA), which transcriptionally reprograms CD4+ T-cells for increased HIV-1 permissiveness. Consistently, colon-infiltrating CD4+ T-cells carry replication-competent viral reservoirs in people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Intriguingly, integrative infection in colon macrophages, a pool replenished by circulating monocytes, represents a rare event in ART-treated PLWH, thus questioning on HIV-1 permissiveness in gut-resident macrophages. Here, we demonstrate that RA significantly boosts R5 but not X4 HIV-1 replication in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). RNA-Sequencing, Gene Set Variation Analysis, and HIV interactor NCBI database interrogation, revealed RA-mediated transcriptional reprogramming associated with metabolic/inflammatory processes and HIV-1 resistance/dependency factors. Functional validations pointed to mechanisms of RA action, including CCR5 upregulation and SAMHD1 phosphorylation under the control of mTOR. These results support a model in which intestinal MDM contribute to viral replication/dissemination before ART and upon treatment interruption in mTOR-sensitive manner.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus subtilis spores are produced inside the cytosol of a mother cell. Spore surface assembly requires the SpoVK protein in the mother cell, but its function is unknown. Here, we report that SpoVK is a dedicated chaperone from a distinct higher-order clade of AAA+ ATPases that activates the peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase MurG during sporulation, even though MurG does not normally require activation by a chaperone during vegetative growth. MurG redeploys to the spore surface during sporulation, where we show that the local pH is reduced and propose that this change in cytosolic nanoenvironment necessitates a specific chaperone for proper MurG function. Further, we show that SpoVK participates in a developmental checkpoint in which improper spore surface assembly inactivates SpoVK, which leads to sporulation arrest. The AAA+ ATPase clade containing SpoVK includes other dedicated chaperones involved in secretion, cell-envelope biosynthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting that such fine-tuning might be a widespread feature of different subcellular nanoenvironments.",

    "abstract": "Chemicals involved in plutonium uranium reduction extraction (PUREX) have the potential to be released from nuclear reprocessing facilities and accumulate in the environment. In order to understand how soil microbial communities respond to contamination by PUREX chemicals, we carried out a series of microcosm experiments, exposing chemically diverse soils to a range of concentrations of key chemicals used in the PUREX process. We tested 4 PUREX chemicals, and 5 soil types using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, determining that responses of microbial communities are dependent on the soil type in which they reside, and that tributyl phosphate exposure appears to generate the most reproducible and detectable shifts in microbial communities. We identified a number of key taxa that are consistently enriched in soils exposed to tributyl phosphate. These key taxa are either in the family Rhizobiaceae or genus Pseudomonas. The relative abundance of these key taxa is concentration dependent, and their abundance remains elevated at least 100 days post initial exposure. Using whole-shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we reconstructed the genomes of these key taxa and find a number of putative phosphotriesterase genes found only in Rhizobiaceae. We find the abundance of phosphotriesterase genes is significantly higher in samples exposed to tributyl phosphate. These phosphotriesterase genes, which degrade tributyl phosphate into dibutyl phosphate and butanol, may serve as effective biomarkers for tributyl phosphate contaminated soil, as well as a method for future bioremediation.",

    "abstract": "Traditional assays for counting bacteriophages and their lysogens are labor-intensive and highly perturbative to the host cells. Here, we present a high-throughput infection method where all steps--cell growth, viral encounters, and post-infection recovery--take place in a microplate reader, and the growth dynamics of the infected culture are measured continuously using the optical density (OD). We find that the post-infection dynamics are reproducible and interpretable. In particular, the OD at which the culture lyses scales linearly with the logarithm of the initial phage concentration, providing a way of measuring phage numbers in unknown samples over nine decades and down to single-phage sensitivity. Interpreting the measured dynamics using a mathematical model for the coupled kinetics of phages and bacteria further allows us to infer the rates of viral encounters and cell lysis. Adding a single step of antibiotic selection provides the ability to measure the rate of host lysogenization. To demonstrate the application of our assay, we characterized the effect of bacterial growth rate on the propensity of lambda phage to lysogenize E. coli. When infected by a single phage, the probability of lysogenization is found to decrease approximately exponentially with the host growth rate. In growing, but not in stationary, cells, the propensity to lysogenize increases ~50-fold when multiple phages co-infect the cell. These findings illuminate how host physiology feeds into the lysis/lysogeny decision circuit, and demonstrate the utility of high-throughput infection to interrogating phage-host interactions.",

However, few deep-sea SRB have been cultivated and studied in situ, limiting our understanding of the true metabolism of SRB in the deep biosphere. Here, we firstly clarified the high abundance of SRB in deep-sea cold seep sediments and successfully isolated a sulfate-reducing bacterium (strain zrk46). Our genomic, physiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate that strain zrk46 is a novel species, which we propose as Pseudodesulfovibrio serpens. Based on the combined results from growth assays and proteomic analyses, we found that supplementation with sulfate (SO42-), thiosulfate (S2O32-), or sulfite (SO32-) promoted the growth of strain zrk46 by facilitating energy production through the dissimilatory sulfate reduction with the auxiliary functions of heterodisulfide reductases, ferredoxins, and nitrate reduction associated proteins, which were coupled with the oxidation of environmental organic matter in both laboratory and deep-sea in situ conditions. Moreover, metatranscriptomic results confirmed the dissimilatory sulfate reduction of deep-sea SRB in deep-sea environment, which might be coupled to the methane oxidation of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME-2) through direct interspecies electron transfer via cytochromes.",

    "abstract": "Connecting genes to phenotypic traits in bacteria is often challenging because of a lack of environmental context in laboratory settings. Laboratory-based model ecosystems offer a means to better account for environmental conditions compared to standard planktonic cultures, and can help link genotypes and phenotypes. Here, we present a simple, cost-effective, laboratory-based model ecosystem to study aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) within the methane-oxygen counter gradient typically found in the natural environment of these organisms. Culturing the methanotroph Methylomonas sp. strain LW13 in this system resulted in formation of a distinct horizontal band at the intersection of the counter gradient, which we discovered was not due to increased numbers of viable bacteria at this location but instead to an increased amount of polysaccharides. We also discovered that different methanotrophic taxa form polysaccharide bands with distinct locations and morphologies when grown in the methane-oxygen counter gradient. By comparing transcriptomic data from LW13 growing within and surrounding this band, we identified genes correlated with polysaccharide band formation within the model ecosystem and validated the involvement of these genes with knockout strains. Notably, these genes were also required for cell growth in the system. This work highlights the use of a laboratory-based model ecosystem that more closely mimics the natural environment to uncover methanotroph phenotypes missing from standard planktonic cultures, and to link these phenotypes with their genetic determinants.",

A total of 1715 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, were retrieved from GISAID and subjected to cluster analysis. Immunoinformatics were used to predict T- and B-cell epitopes, followed by simulation to estimate either pro- or anti-inflammatory responses and correlate with circulating variants.

Twenty-four hours after ONC and 1 hour after NMDA injection, we collected RGCs using CD90.2 coupled magnetic beads, prepared protein extracts, and employed LC-MS for the global proteomic analysis of RGCs. Statistically significant changes in proteins were analyzed using the Shiny Go program to identify GO biological processes and molecular functions resulting from the treatment. We identified unique and common alterations in protein profiles in RGCs undergoing different types of cellular stressors. Additionally, we observed the absence of certain proteins in treated RGCs compared to the control group.

    "abstract": "BRCA2 has multiple functional domains that interact with different partners, and is essential for both somatic and meiotic homologous recombination (HR). We created a Brca2{Delta}12-14 mouse model with an internal deletion of the region which we named \"the meiotic domain of BRCA2\", as its loss results in complete failure of meiotic HR, while somatic HR is intact. The deletion in the protein includes the HSF2BP-binding motifs (exons 12-13) and the DMC1-binding PhePP domain (exon 14). Brca2{Delta}12-14 mice showed complete infertility in both males and females, with sexually dimorphic features. Recombinase foci (both RAD51 and DMC1) were completely undetectable in mutant spermatocytes, but while DMC1 foci were also absent in mutant oocytes, RAD51 foci numbers were only partially reduced (up to 60% fewer, 20% less intense). The relevance of the PhePP domain for meiotic HR has been controversial, but both the phenotype of Brca2{Delta}12-14, and our biochemical data indicate that, along with the BRC repeats of BRCA2, PhePP is both essential and specific for DMC1 loading in meiotic HR, analogous to the C-terminal RAD51-specific TR2/CTRB. Further investigation of DSB end processing in Brca2{Delta}12-14 meiocytes and controls, using super-resolution imaging of RPA and SYCP3 led to discovery of two novel features. First, in Brca2{Delta}12-14 oocytes, but not in the spermatocytes nor wild types, we observed RPA foci as doublets ~200 nm apart, which could represent DSB end separation. Second, we describe RPA structures that are completely HR-dependent and are indicative of long, double-stranded DNA connections between homologs prior to synapsis. The observations led us to a model for chromosome alignment via multiple, tensed DNA tethers that connect the homologous DNA regions. We propose that in combination with dynamic adjustment of chromatin loops by meiotic cohesins, this is a plausible molecular mechanism to bring the homologs closer and initiate synapsis.",

    "abstract": "Recently, we have achieved a significant milestone with the creation of the Fly Cell Atlas. This single-nuclei atlas encompasses the entire fly, covering the entire head and body, in addition to all major organs. This atlas catalogs hundreds to thousands of cell types, of which we annotated 250. This still leaves many clusters to be fully characterized, in particular in the brain. Furthermore, with single-nuclei sequencing, all information about the spatial location of the cells and of the mRNAs within these cells is lost. Here, we provide a solution to this problem. In a proof of concept study, we have applied spatial transcriptomics using a selected gene panel to pinpoint the locations of 150 mRNA species in the adult fly. This enabled us to map unknown cell types identified in the Fly Cell Atlas to their spatial locations in the brain. Additionally, spatial transcriptomics discovered interesting principles of mRNA localization in large crowded muscle cells that may spark future mechanistic investigations. Furthermore, we present a set of computational tools that will allow for easier integration of spatial transcriptomics and single-cell datasets.",

Functional interrogation of nuclear protein binding affinity, enhancer/promoter regulatory activity, and chromatin-chromatin interactions in immune, salivary gland epithelial, and kidney epithelial cells revealed cell type-specific allelic effects for all five SNPs that expanded regulation beyond effects on DDX6 and CXCR5 expression. Mapping the local chromatin regulatory network revealed several additional genes of interest, including lnc-PHLDB1-1. Collectively, functional characterization implicated the risk alleles of these SNPs as modulators of promoter and/or enhancer activities that regulate cell type-specific expression of DDX6, CXCR5, and lnc-PHLDB1-1, among others. Further, these findings emphasize the importance of exploring the functional significance of SNPs in the context of complex chromatin architecture in disease-relevant cell types and tissues.",

    "abstract": "Accuracy and efficiency are fundamental characteristics of the translational process. Codon usage bias is widespread across species. Despite the long-standing association between codon optimization and improved translation, our understanding of the evolutionary basis and functional effects of codon optimization is limited. Drosophila has been widely used to study codon usage bias, but genome-scale experimental data on codon optimization and translation are scarce. We examined high-resolution mass spectrometry datasets from D. melanogaster development and employed different strategies to reduce bias when comparing translation error rates. We demonstrated that optimal codons have lower translation errors than nonoptimal codons after accounting for these biases. Our findings also shed light on codon-anticodon mismatches in translation errors. Through genomic-scale analysis of ribosome profiling data, we showed that optimal codons are translated more rapidly than nonoptimal codons in D. melanogaster. While we did not find conclusive evidence that natural selection favored synonymous mutations during the long-term evolution of the D. melanogaster lineage after its divergence from D. simulans, we did find that positive selection drives codon optimization-related mutations in the D. melanogaster population. This study expands our understanding of the functional consequences of codon optimization, and serves as a foundation for future investigations into the molecular mechanisms governing gene expression evolution at the translation level.",

    "abstract": "Unrepaired DNA damage encountered by the cellular replication machinery can stall DNA replication, ultimately leading to cell death. In the DNA damage tolerance pathway translesion synthesis (TLS), replication stalling is alleviated by the recruitment of specialized polymerases to synthesize short stretches of DNA near a lesion. Although TLS promotes cell survival, most TLS polymerases are low fidelity and must be tightly regulated to avoid harmful mutagenesis. The gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli has served as the model organism for studies of the molecular mechanisms of bacterial TLS. However, it is poorly understood whether these same mechanisms apply to other bacteria. Here, we use in vivo single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to investigate the TLS polymerase Pol Y1 in the model gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. We find significant differences in the localization and dynamics of Pol Y1 in comparison to its E. coli homolog, Pol IV. Notably, Pol Y1 is constitutively enriched at or near sites of replication in the absence of DNA damage through interactions with the DnaN clamp; in contrast, Pol IV has been shown to be selectively enriched only upon replication stalling. These results suggest key differences in the roles and mechanisms of regulation of TLS polymerases across different bacterial species.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, protein kinase signaling is regulated by a diverse array of post-translational modifications (PTMs). While regulation by activation segment phosphorylation in Ser/Thr kinases is well understood, relatively little is known about how oxidation of cysteine (Cys) amino acids modulate catalysis. In this study, we investigate redox regulation of the AMPK-related Brain-selective kinases (BRSK) 1 and 2, and detail how broad catalytic activity is directly regulated through reversible oxidation and reduction of evolutionarily conserved Cys residues within the catalytic domain. We show that redox-dependent control of BRSKs is a dynamic and multilayered process involving oxidative modifications of several Cys residues, including the formation of intra-molecular disulfide bonds involving a pair of Cys residues near the catalytic HRD motif and a highly conserved T-Loop Cys with a BRSK-specific Cys within an unusual CPE motif at the end of the activation segment. Consistently, mutation of the CPE-Cys increases catalytic activity in vitro and drives phosphorylation of the BRSK substrate Tau in cells. Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that oxidation of the CPE-Cys destabilizes a conserved salt bridge network critical for allosteric activation. The occurrence of spatially proximal Cys amino acids in diverse Ser/Thr protein kinase families suggests that disulfide mediated control of catalytic activity may be a prevalent mechanism for regulation within the broader AMPK family.",

    "abstract": "Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) functions in many types of immune cells and is a major chemotherapeutic target. BTK is activated at the plasma membrane and can dimerize through its pleckstrin-homology and contiguous tec-homology domains (the PH-TH module). The features that support dimerization of the PH-TH module are unique to BTK among the Tec kinases and appeared relatively recently in evolutionary history. Previous studies suggest that dimerization enhances kinase activity by promoting trans autophosphorylation, but whether BTK dimerizes in cells via the PH-TH module, and whether this dimerization controls signaling, is unknown. To address this question, we developed a high-throughput mutagenesis assay for BTK function in B cells and T cells. We measured the fitness costs for thousands of point mutations in the PH-TH module and kinase domain, allowing us to assess whether dimerization of the PH-TH module and BTK kinase activity are necessary for function. In Ramos B cells we find that neither dimerization nor kinase activity is required for BTK signaling. Instead, in Ramos cells, BTK signaling is enhanced by mutations that increase membrane adsorption, even at the cost of reduced PH-TH dimerization. In contrast, in Jurkat T cells, we find that BTK signaling depends on PH-TH dimerization and also on kinase activity. These results provide a framework for understanding why PH-TH dimerization is a more recent evolutionary innovation that is not conserved across the Tec family.",

    "abstract": "During bacterial cell division, hydrolysis of septal peptidoglycan (sPG) is crucial for cell separation. This sPG hydrolysis is performed by the enzyme amidases whose activity is regulated by the integral membrane protein complex FtsEX-EnvC. FtsEX is an ATP-binding cassette transporter and EnvC is a long coiled-coiled protein that interacts with and activates the amidases. The molecular mechanism by which the FtsEX-EnvC complex activates amidases remains largely unclear. We present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the FtsEX-EnvC complex from the pathogenic bacteria V. cholerae (FtsEX-EnvCVC). FtsEX-EnvCVC in the presence of ADP adopts a distinct conformation where EnvC is horizontally extended rather than vertically extended. Subsequent structural studies suggest that EnvC can swing between these conformations in space in a nucleotide-dependent manner. Our structural analysis and functional studies suggest that FtsEX-EnvCvc may employ spatial control of EnvC for amidase activation, suggesting species-specific diversity in the FtsEX-EnvC regulation on septal peptidoglycan hydrolysis.",

This emerging \"lab on a particle\" technique requires hydrogel particles with tunable material properties and dimensions. The crescent shape of the particles is attained by aqueous two-phase separation of polymers inside a spherical droplet followed by photopolymerization of the curable precursor. In this work, we have investigated the phase separation of photo-curable poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA, Mw 700) and dextran (Mw 40,000) for tunable manufacturing of crescent-shaped particles. The particles' morphology was precisely tuned by following a phase diagram, varying the UV intensity, and adjusting the flow rate ratio between the three streams, containing PEGDA, dextran, and oil, within a microfluidic droplet generation device. The fabricated particles with variable cavity sizes and outer diameters encapsulated uniform aqueous droplets upon mixing with a continuous oil phase. The particles were fluorescently labeled with red and blue emitting dyes at variable concentrations to produce six color-coded particles. The blue fluorescent dye showed a moderate response to the pH change from 1 to 7 in terms of an increase in emitted intensity. The fluorescently labeled particles were able to tolerate an extremely acidic solution (pH 1) but disintegrated within an extremely basic solution (pH 14). The particle-templated droplets were able to effectively retain the disintegrating particle and the fluorescent signal at pH 14, indicating completely segregated compartments.",

This study leverages single cell sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with RA and matched healthy controls to identify disease relevant cell subsets and cell type specific signatures of disease. Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 18 RA patients and 18 matched controls, accounting for age, gender, race, and ethnicity). Samples were processed using standard CellRanger and Scanpy pipelines, pseudobulk differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2, and cell-cell communication analysis using CellChat. Results: We identified 18 distinct PBMC subsets, including a novel IFITM3+ monocyte subset. CD4+ T effector memory cells were increased in patients with moderate to high disease activity (DAS28-CRP [&ge;] 3.2), while non-classical monocytes were decreased in patients with low disease activity or remission (DAS28-CRP < 3.2). Differential gene expression analysis identified RA-associated genes in IFITM3+ and non-classical monocyte subsets, and downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes in the V{delta} subset. Additionally, we identified gene signatures associated with disease activity, characterized by upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNF, JUN, EGR1, IFIT2, MAFB, G0S2, and downregulation of HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB5, TNFSF13B. Notably, cell-cell communication analysis revealed upregulation of immune-associated signaling pathways, including VISTA, in patients with RA. Conclusions: We provide a novel single-cell transcriptomics dataset of PBMCs from patients with RA, and identify insights into the systemic cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying RA disease activity.",

In BCG-vaccinated WT mice, Mtb continues to persist inside neutrophils, which is sensitive to COX2 inhibition.

The longitudinal variations in microtubule (MT) structures and the lumenal scaffold complexes connecting them have been determined, as well as membrane-associated transition zone structures: Y-shaped links connecting MT to the membrane, and ciliary beads connected to them that protrude from the cell surface and form a necklace-like structure.

    "abstract": "The retina's sensitivity to light depends on the primary cilium of photoreceptors, known as the outer segment (OS). OS defects are a primary cause of inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) and can also indicate wider ciliary dysfunctions. One such IRD is Leber congenital amaurosis type 10 (LCA10), which occurs as a monosymptomatic retinal disease or the presenting symptom of syndromic ciliopathies within the Senior-Loken-Joubert-Meckel spectrum. LCA10 patients are born blind but retain dormant photoreceptors for decades, offering the potential for reactivation. AAV-based gene therapies for IRDs cannot accommodate the large CEP290 gene, prompting the search for innovative treatments. LCA10 is caused by mutations in CEP290, which plays a vital role in ciliation, similar to cAMP signaling. Utilizing patient fibroblasts displaying variable CEP290 mutations and associated ciliary defects, we show that exposure to Taprenepag, a specific PGE2 receptor agonist, substantially stimulated cAMP synthesis and consistently improved cilia formation and elongation. We also found that intraperitoneal injection of Taprenepag in mice reached the retina and slowed retinal degeneration, promoting OS formation, and improving light sensitivity in a Cep290 mutant mouse. These findings demonstrate the potential of Taprenepag to treat the CEP290-related visual dysfunction and suggest evaluation for other CEP290-related organ issues and ciliopathies.",

    "abstract": "Amino acid insertions and deletions (indels) are an abundant class of genetic variants. However, compared to substitutions, the effects of indels are not well understood and poorly predicted. Here we address this shortcoming by performing deep indel mutagenesis (DIM) of structurally diverse proteins. Indel tolerance is strikingly different to substitution tolerance and varies extensively both between different proteins and within different regions of the same protein. Although state of the art variant effect predictors perform poorly on indels, we show that both experimentally-measured and computationally-predicted substitution scores can be repurposed as good indel variant effect predictors by incorporating information on protein secondary structures. Quantifying the effects of indels on protein-protein interactions reveals that insertions can be an important class of gain-of-function variants. Our results provide an overview of the impact of indels on proteins and a method to predict their effects genome-wide.",

However, to communicate with the external environment, protein translocation across lipid membranes must take place. In living cells, protein transport across membranes is achieved with the aid of complex translocase systems which are difficult to reconstitute into artificial cells. Thus, there is need for simple mechanisms by which proteins can be encoded and expressed inside synthetic compartments yet still be externally displayed. Here we present a genetically encodable membrane functionalization system based on mutants of pore-forming proteins. We show that the membrane translocating loop of alpha-hemolysin can be engineered to translocate functional peptides up to 52 amino acids across lipid membranes. Engineered hemolysins can be used for genetically programming artificial cells to display interacting peptide pairs, enabling their assembly into artificial tissue-like structures capable of signal transduction.",

    "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses, and microbial dysbiosis associated with CRS is thought to be a key driver of host inflammation that contributes to disease progression. Staphylococcus aureus is a common upper respiratory tract (URT) pathobiont that is associated with higher carriage rates in CRS populations, where S. aureus secreted toxins can be identified in CRS tissue samples. Although many genera of bacteria colonize the URT, relatively few account for the majority of sequencing reads. These include S. aureus, as well as several species belonging to the genus Corynebacterium, including Corynebacterium propinquum and Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, which are observed at high relative abundance in the URT of healthy individuals. Studies have examined the bacterial interactions between the major microbionts of the URT and S. aureus, but few have done so in the context of a healthy versus diseased URT environment. Here, we examine the role of temperature in commensal, pathogen, and epithelial dynamics using an air-liquid interface cell culture model mimicking the nasal epithelial environment. The healthy URT temperature changes from the nares to the nasopharynx and is altered during disease. Temperatures representative of the healthy URT increase persistence and aggregate formation of commensal C. propinquum and C. pseudodiphtheriticum, reduce S. aureus growth, and lower epithelial cytotoxicity compared to higher temperatures correlating with the diseased CRS sinus. Dual-species colonization revealed species-specific interactions between commensal Corynebacterium species and S. aureus dependent on temperature. Our findings suggest that URT mucosal temperature plays a significant role in mediating polymicrobial and host-bacterial interactions that may exacerbate microbial dysbiosis found in chronic URT disease.",

    "abstract": "Organisms across taxa are exposed to stresses such as variable temperature, redox imbalance, and xenobiotics. Successfully responding to stress and restoring homeostasis is crucial for viability of the organism. During aging, the ability to effectively respond to stress declines, contributing to development of disease. In many multicellular animals, aging also coincides with changes in the microbiome that can contribute to disease-states. Because animals and their microbiota coexist in the same broad environment, they each must adapt to similar stresses. However, the short generation time of microbes leads to faster evolution, allowing the possibility that microbial stress adaptation may influence host physiology. Here we leverage a simplified model involving the nematode C. elegans and its bacterial diet. Our work highlights how bacterial adaptation to oxidative stress impacts the host's lifespan and response to stress. Intriguingly, our findings reveal that worms fed with bacteria adapted to withstand oxidative stress exhibit enhanced stress resistance and an extended lifespan. Through whole genome sequencing, genetic assays, and metabolic analysis, this study underscores the pivotal role of the bacterial iron-sulfur pathway in governing host stress resistance and lifespan. We further find that iron in the stress-evolved bacteria boost the worm's stress resistance and lifespan through activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that understanding the evolutionary path of microbial adaptation during stress could be leveraged to slow aging and mitigate age-related decline in health.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory elements drive many complex biological phenomena such as fetal development, and their mutations are linked to a multitude of common human diseases. The phenotypic impacts of regulatory variants are often tested using their conserved orthologous counterparts in model organisms such as mice. However, mapping human enhancers to conserved elements in mice remains a challenge, due to both rapid evolution of enhancers and limitations of current computational methods to detect conserved regulatory sequences. To improve upon existing computational methods and to better understand the sources of this apparent regulatory divergence, we comprehensively measured the evolutionary dynamics of distal enhancers across 45 matched human/mouse cell/tissue pairs from more than 1,000 DNase-seq experiments. Using this expansive dataset, we show that while cell-specific regulatory vocabulary is conserved, enhancers evolve more rapidly than other genomic elements such as promoters and CTCF binding sites. We observed surprisingly high levels of cell-specific variability in enhancer conservation rates, in part explainable by tissue specific transposable element activity. To improve orthologous enhancer mapping, we developed an improved genome alignment algorithm using gapped-kmer sequence features, and using the matched cell/tissue pairs, we show that this novel computational method, gkm-align, discovers 23,660 novel human/mouse conserved enhancers missed by standard alignment algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Robust Perfect Adaptation (RPA) is a desired property of biological systems wherein a system\\'s output perfectly adapts to a steady state, irrespective of a broad class of perturbations. Achieving RPA typically requires the deployment of integral controllers, which continually adjust the system\\'s output based on the cumulative error over time. However, the action of these integral controllers can lead to a phenomenon known as \\\"windup\\\". Windup occurs when an actuator in the system is unable to respond to the controller\\'s commands, often due to physical constraints, causing the integral error to accumulate significantly. In biomolecular control systems, this phenomenon is especially pronounced due to the positivity of molecular concentrations, inevitable promoter saturation and resource limitations. To protect against such performance deterioration or even instability, we present three biomolecular anti-windup topologies. The underlying architectures of these topologies are then linked to classical control-theoretic anti-windup strategies. This link is made possible due the development of a general model reduction result for chemical reaction networks with fast sequestration reactions that is valid in both the deterministic and stochastic settings. The topologies are realized as chemical reaction networks for which genetic designs, harnessing the flexibility of inteins, are proposed. To validate the efficacy of our designs in mitigating windup effects, we perform simulations across a range of biological systems, including a complex model of Type I diabetic patients and advanced biomolecular proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers. This work lays a foundation for developing robust and reliable biomolecular control systems, providing necessary safety and protection against windup-induced instability.",

    "abstract": "Persistent, memorandum-specific neuronal spiking activity has long been hypothesized to underlie working memory. However, emerging evidence suggests a possible role for 'activity-silent' synaptic mechanisms. This issue remains controversial because evidence for either view has largely depended on datasets that fail to capture single-trial population dynamics or on indirect measures of neuronal spiking. We addressed this by examining the dynamics of mnemonic information on single trials obtained from large, local populations of prefrontal neurons recorded simultaneously in monkeys performing a working memory task. We show that mnemonic information does not persist in the spiking activity of prefrontal neurons, but instead alternates between 'On' and 'Off' periods during memory delays. At the level of single neurons, Off periods are driven by a coordinated loss of selectivity for memoranda and a return of firing rates to baseline levels. Further exploiting the large-scale recordings, we asked whether the functional connectivity among large neuronal ensembles depended on information held in working memory. We show that mnemonic information is available in the pattern of ensemble connectivity during the memory delay in both On and Off periods of neuronal activity. Intermittent epochs of memoranda-specific spiking therefore coexist with activity-silent mechanisms to span memory delays.",

    "abstract": "Malaria, which results from infection with Plasmodium parasites, remains a major public health problem. While humans do not develop long-lived, sterilizing immunity, protection against symptomatic disease develops after repeated exposure to Plasmodium parasites and correlates with the acquisition of humoral immunity. Despite the established role antibodies play in protection from malaria disease, dysregulated inflammation is thought to contribute to the sub-optimal immune response to Plasmodium infection. Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection results in a fatal severe malaria disease in mice. We previously demonstrated that treatment of mice with IL-15 complex (IL-15C; IL-15 bound to an IL-15R-Fc fusion protein) induces IL-10 expression in NK cells, which protects mice from PbA-induced death. Using a novel MHC class II tetramer to identify PbA-specific CD4+ T cells, herein we demonstrate that IL-15C treatment enhances Tfh differentiation. Moreover, genetic deletion of NK cell-derived IL-10 or IL-10R expression on T cells prevents IL-15C-induced Tfh differentiation. Additionally, IL-15C treatment results in increased anti-PbA IgG antibody levels and improves survival following reinfection. Overall, these data demonstrate that IL-15C treatment, via its induction of IL-10 from NK cells, modulates the dysregulated inflammation during Plasmodium infection to promote Tfh differentiation and antibody generation, correlating with improved survival from reinfection. These findings will facilitate improved control of malaria infection and protection from disease by informing therapeutic strategies and vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "Psychosocial experiences affect brain health and aging trajectories, but the molecular pathways underlying these associations remain unclear. Normal brain function relies heavily on energy transformation by mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), and two main lines of evidence bi-directionally link mitochondria as both targets and drivers of psychosocial experiences. On the one hand, chronic stress exposure and possibly mood states alter multiple aspects of mitochondrial biology; and on the other hand, functional variations in mitochondrial OxPhos capacity alter social behavior, stress reactivity, and mood. However, knowledge on whether positive or negative psychosocial exposures and experiences are linked to mitochondrial biology in the human brain is currently unknown. By combining longitudinal antemortem assessments of psychosocial factors with postmortem brain (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) proteomics in older adults, we found that positive experiences (e.g. higher well-being) are linked to greater abundance of the mitochondrial OxPhos machinery, whereas negative experiences (e.g. higher negative mood) are linked to lower OxPhos protein content. Combined, psychosocial factors explained 18% of the variance in the abundance of OxPhos complex I, the primary biochemical entry point that energizes brain mitochondria. To increase the sensitivity of our approach, we next interrogated mitochondrial psychobiological associations in specific neuronal and non-neuronal brain cells with single-nucleus RNA sequencing. These results revealed strong cell type specific associations, particularly between positive psychosocial experiences and molecular mitochondrial phenotypes in glial cells, whereas neurons tended to show opposite associations. Accordingly, in bulk transcriptomic analyses where all cells are pooled, these RNA-based associations were masked. Thus, our results highlight the likely underestimation of effect sizes in bulk brain tissues, and document novel cell type specific mitochondrial psychobiological associations in the human brain. Cell type specific mitochondrial recalibrations represent a potential psychobiological pathway linking positive and negative psychosocial experiences to human brain biology.",

However, the impact of the Asiatic mouflon subspecies in Iran on sheep domestication remains unclear. Here, we conducted a comprehensive population genomics analysis of Asiatic mouflons in Iran with 780 whole-genome sequences, 767 whole mitogenomes, and 239 Y chromosomes. Whole-genome sequence analyses revealed two subpopulations of the Asiatic mouflons in Iran: O. gmelini_2 limited in Kabudan and O. gmelini_1 over a wide geographic area. Phylogenetic analyses of the Asiatic mouflons in Iran based on uniparental variants revealed a monophyletic lineage with the mitochondrial haplogroups C+E, and clustered into a monophyletic with Y-chromosomal lineage HY2 of sheep. Additionally, introgression tests detected significant signals of genetic introgression from O. gmelini_2 to four sheep populations (e.g., Garut, Garole, Bangladeshi, and Sumatra) in South and Southeast Asia. In the four sheep populations, selective tests and introgression signals revealed that the wild introgression could have contributed to their small body size and local adaptation to the hot and humid environments in the Indian Peninsula. Our results suggested that the maternal haplogroups C+E and paternal lineage HY2 could have originated from the Asiatic mouflon in Iran. Also, our findings provide new insights into sheep domestication and subsequent introgressions from wild ancestors to domestic populations.",

To select candidates for the remaining 95% of loci, we developed a method to identify conserved genes underlying GWAS loci in multiple species. For 19 ionomic traits, we identified 14,336 candidates across Arabidopsis, soybean, rice, maize, and sorghum. We calculated the likelihood of candidates with random permutations of the data and determined that most of the top 10% of candidates were orthologous genes linked to GWAS loci across all five species. The candidate list also includes orthologous genes with previously established ionomic functions in Arabidopsis and rice. Our methods highlight the conserved nature of ionomic genetic regulators and enable the identification of previously unknown ionomic genes.",
