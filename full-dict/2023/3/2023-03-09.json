    "abstract": "Connectivity among isolated habitat patches via planktonic larval dispersal is crucial for maintaining the regional diversity of hydrothermal vents. Despite, increasing sophistication of techniques for simulating dispersal, limited information on biological and behavioural traits of vent-associated species has unknown affects on the applicability of these methods for conservation. Here we focus on the role of periodic reproduction on dispersal among hydrothermal vents, as periodic spawning has increasingly been observed in a variety of taxa. For generalizeability, we simulate the dispersal of larvae under treatments of periodic and aperiodic release timing at various depths, with a consistant but variable planktonic larval duration. Our results show a highly variable effect of periodicity on the characteristics and distribution of dispersal, which are heavily modified by the dispersal depth and source location. The capacity for reproductive periodicity to impact the among-site dispersal warrents further investigation into its prevelance and timing among vent-associated fauna.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease seen with advancing age. Recent studies have revealed diverse AD-associated cell states, yet when and how they impact the causal chain leading to AD remains unknown. To reconstruct the dynamics of the brains cellular environment along the disease cascade and to distinguish between AD and aging effects, we built a comprehensive cell atlas of the aged prefrontal cortex from 1.64 million single-nucleus RNA-seq profiles. We associated glial, vascular and neuronal subpopulations with AD-related traits for 424 aging individuals, and aligned them along the disease cascade using causal modeling. We identified two distinct lipid-associated microglial subpopulations, one contributed to amyloid-{beta} proteinopathy while the other mediated the effect of amyloid-{beta} in accelerating tau proteinopathy, as well as an astrocyte subpopulation that mediated the effect of tau on cognitive decline. To model the coordinated dynamics of the entire cellular environment we devised the BEYOND methodology which uncovered two distinct trajectories of brain aging that are defined by distinct sequences of changes in cellular communities. Older individuals are engaged in one of two possible trajectories, each associated with progressive changes in specific cellular communities that end with: (1) AD dementia or (2) alternative brain aging. Thus, we provide a cellular foundation for a new perspective of AD pathophysiology that could inform the development of new therapeutic interventions targeting cellular communities, while designing a different clinical management for those individuals on the path to AD or to alternative brain aging.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDHighly palatable food triggers behavioral alterations reminiscent of those induced by addictive drugs. These effects involve the reward system and dopamine neurons, which modulate neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of highly palatable food on feeding behavior are poorly understood.\n\nMETHODSWe studied the effects of 2-week operant conditioning of mice with standard or isocaloric highly palatable food. We investigated the behavioral effects and dendritic spine modifications in the NAc. We compared the translating mRNA in NAc neurons identified by the type of dopamine receptors they express, depending on the type of food and training. We tested the consequences of invalidation of an abundant downregulated gene, Ncdn (Neurochondrin).\n\nRESULTSOperant conditioning for highly palatable food increases motivation for food even in well-fed mice. In control mice, free access to regular or highly palatable food results in increased weight as compared to regular food only. Highly palatable food increases spine density in the NAc. In animals trained for highly palatable food, translating mRNAs are modified in NAc dopamine D2-receptor-expressing neurons, mostly corresponding to striatal projection neurons, but not in those expressing D1-receptors. Knock-out of Ncdn, an abundant down-regulated gene, opposes the conditioning-induced changes in satiety-sensitive feeding behavior and apparent motivation for highly palatable food, suggesting down-regulation may be a compensatory mechanism.\n\nCONCLUSIONSOur results emphasize the importance of mRNA alterations D2 striatal projection neurons in the NAc in the behavioral consequences of highly palatable food conditioning and suggest a modulatory contribution of Ncdn downregulation.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies capable of neutralising SARS-CoV-2 have been well studied, but the Fc receptor-dependent antibody activities that also significantly impact the course of infection have not been studied in such depth. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces antibody-dependent NK cell responses targeting multiple antigens, however, as most vaccines induce only anti-spike antibodies, we investigated spike-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Vaccination produced antibodies that only weakly induced ADCC, however, antibodies from individuals who were infected prior to vaccination ( hybrid immunity) elicited much stronger anti-spike ADCC. Quantitative and qualitative aspects of humoral immunity contributed to this capability, with infection skewing IgG antibody production towards S2, vaccination skewing towards S1 and hybrid immunity evoking strong responses against both domains. The capacity for hybrid immunity to provide superior spike-directed ADCC was associated with selectively increased antibody responses against epitopes within both S1 and S2. Antibodies targeting both spike domains were important for strong antibody-dependent NK cell activation, with three regions of antibody reactivity outside the receptor-binding domain (RBD) corresponding with potent anti-spike ADCC. Consequently, ADCC induced by hybrid immunity with ancestral antigen was conserved against variants containing neutralisation escape mutations in the RBD [Delta and Omicron (BA.1)]. Induction of antibodies recognizing a broad range of spike epitopes and eliciting strong and durable ADCC may partially explain why hybrid immunity provides superior protection against infection and disease than vaccination alone, and demonstrates that spike-only subunit vaccines would benefit from strategies to induce a combination of S1- and S2-specific antibody responses.\n\nSignificanceNeutralising antibodies prevent the entry of cell-free virus, however, antibodies that promote Fc-dependent activities such as ADCC are critical to control cell-associated virus. Although current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines induce potent neutralising antibodies, they fail to induce robust ADCC. Our demonstration that hybrid immunity induces superior ADCC with pan-variant activity may partially explain why hybrid immunity offers enhanced protection against reinfection. It also highlights that vaccine strategies based on expression of the spike subunit alone should not focus solely on inducing antibody responses targeting the receptor binding domain.",

CSC skin- and intestine microbiomes were collected, facilitated by Inuit fishers at sites on and around King William Island, Nunavut, at the northern range limits of lake whitefish. Community composition was explored using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, with significant differences in microbiota dispersions depending on fishing site salinity for lake whitefish intestine and skin, as well as cisco skin. Overall, lake whitefish intestine communities appeared more variable than cisco and had higher Shannon diversity, suggesting that lake whitefish and their microbiomes could be more susceptible to environmental stress possibly leading to dysbiosis. Although cisco condition was similar among distinct seasonal habitats, the higher average lake whitefish condition in freshwater rivers suggests that fishing these diadromous whitefish in estuaries may be optimal from a sustainable fishery perspective. Taken together, the impact of changing habitats on fish condition and different microbial composition may inform new approaches to CSC health in fisheries and aquaculture, in addition to being relevant for northern Indigenous peoples with subsistence and economic interests in these resources.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn Mycobacterium tuberculosis, molecular predictions of ethambutol resistance rely primarily on the detection of mutations within embB. However, discordance between embB406 mutations and phenotypic drug sensitivity questions its clinical significance. This study aims to decipher the association of embB406 mutations with ethambutol resistance in M. tuberculosis.\n\nMethodsAll M. tuberculosis isolates from our culture collection containing embB406 mutations (n=16) and pan-sensitive control isolates (n=10) were selected for this study. Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing for ethambutol was performed in duplicate on the BACTEC MGIT 960 at concentrations of 2, 3, 4, and 5 g/mL with strain H37Rv as assay control. Whole genome sequencing was performed on Illumina Miseq for drug resistance predictions (MyKrobe Predictor v.0.7.0), phylogenomics (SNVPhyl v.1.2.3) and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis (Snippy).\n\nResultsTwo embB406 mutation subtypes were found among 16 strains: Gly406Asp and Gly406Ala. MyKrobe predicted all strains of either subtype to be ethambutol resistant. However, 12 of 16 strains appear phenotypically sensitive at 5 g/mL but exhibit variable resistance between 2-4 g/mL. Of these 12 strains, a newly described frameshift mutation in regulator embR (Gln258fs) was found in 9 strains.\n\nConclusionsMutations in embB406 are associated with low-level ethambutol resistance currently undetectable by the critical concentration of 5 g/mL for ethambutol. Novel mutations are predicted to exacerbate variability in ethambutol resistance. We suggest amendment to molecular and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing to improve ethambutol DST sensitivity and specificity as well as concordance between rapid and gold standard methods.",

In this study, we modified a DNA aptamer library with N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, enabling covalent reactivity with cognate proteins. We selected for the ability to bind to mouse monoclonal antibodies, resulting in the isolation of two distinct covalent binding motifs. The covalent aptamers are specific for the Fc region of mouse monoclonal IgG1 and are cross-reactive with mouse IgG2a and other IgGs. Investigation into the covalent reactivity of the aptamers revealed a dependence on micromolar concentrations of Cu2+ ions which can be explained by residual catalyst remaining after modification of the aptamer library. The aptamers were successfully used as adapters in the formation of antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates (AOCs) for use in detection of HIV protein p24 and super-resolution imaging of actin. This work introduces a new method for the site-specific modification of native monoclonal antibodies and may be useful in applications requiring AOCs or other antibody conjugates.",

    "abstract": "The increase in reactive oxygens species (ROS) with aging could be at the origin of many diseases of the elderly. Here we investigated the role of ROS in the renewal of the intestinal epithelium in mice lacking catalase (CAT) and/or nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) activities. Cat-/- mice have delayed intestinal epithelium renewal and were prone to develop necrotizing enterocolitis upon starvation. Interestingly, crypts lacking CAT showed fewer intestinal stem cells (ISC) and lower stem cell activity than wild-type, together with less LYS in Paneth cells. In contrast, crypts lacking NNT showed a similar number of ISCs and amount of LYS as wild-type but increased stem cell activity, which was also impaired by the loss of CAT. Cat deficiency caused fat accumulation in crypts, and a fall in the remarkable high amount of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) in PCs. Supporting a role of ATGL in the regulation of ISC activity, its inhibition halt intestinal organoid development. These data suggest that the reduction of the intestine renewal capacity along aging originates from fatty acid metabolic alterations caused by peroxisomal ROS.\n\nSummary statementMice with increased peroxisomal or mitochondrial reactive oxygen species develop intestinal phenotypes that are associated with aging and originate from a defective stem cell niche with impaired fatty acid metabolism.",

The RNA-binding protein ZC3H11A is involved in nuclear mRNA export, and NF-{kappa}B signaling and is essential during mouse embryo development.

In this study, we established the ZC3H11A protein interactome in human and mouse cells. We demonstrate that the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1 interacts specifically with the ZC3H11A protein and controls ZC3H11A localization into nuclear speckles. We report that ZC3H11A specifically interacts with the human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-5) capsid mRNA in a PABPN1-dependent manner. Notably, ZC3H11A uses the same zinc finger motifs to interact with PABPN1 and mRNA, with a single zinc finger motif responsible for these functions. Further, we demonstrate that the lack of ZC3H11A alters the polyadenylation of HAdV-5 capsid mRNA. Taken together, our results suggest that the ZC3H11A protein acts as a novel regulator of polyadenylation of nuclear mRNA.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are among the most serious types of DNA damage and cause mutations and chromosomal rearrangements. In eukaryotes, DSBs are immediately repaired in coordination with chromatin remodeling for the deposition of DSB-related histone modifications and variants. To elucidate the details of DSB-dependent chromatin remodeling throughout the genome, artificial DSBs need to be reproducibly induced at various genomic loci. Recently, in mammals, a comprehensive method for elucidating chromatin remodeling at multiple DSB loci via chemically induced expression of a restriction enzyme was developed. However, this DSB induction system is not suitable for investigating chromatin remodeling during and after DSB repair, and such approach has not been performed in plants. Here, we established a transgenic Arabidopsis plant harboring a restriction enzyme gene Sbf I driven by a heat-inducible promoter. Using this transgenic plant, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) of histones H4K16ac and H2A.Z and investigated dynamics of these histone marks around the endogenous 623 Sbf I recognition sites. We also precisely quantified DSB efficiency at all cleavage sites using the DNA resequencing data obtained by ChIP-seq procedures. From the results, Sbf I-induced DSBs were detected at 360 loci and induced the transient deposition of H4K16ac and H2A.Z around these regions. Interestingly, we also observed the co-localization of H4K16ac and H2A.Z at some DSB loci. Overall, DSB-dependent chromatin remodeling was found to be a highly conserved between plants and animals. These findings provide new insights into chromatin remodeling that occurs in response to DSBs in Arabidopsis.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in signal transduction pathways lead to various diseases including cancers. MEK1 kinase, encoded by the human MAP2K1 gene, is one of the central components of the MAPK pathway and more than a hundred somatic mutations in MAP2K1 gene were identified in various tumors. Germline mutations deregulating MEK1 also lead to congenital abnormalities, such as the Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome and Arteriovenous Malformation. Evaluating variants associated with a disease is a challenge and computational genomic approaches aid in this process. Establishing evolutionary history of a gene improves computational prediction of disease-causing mutations; however, the evolutionary history of MEK1 is not well understood. Here, by revealing a precise evolutionary history of MEK1 we construct a well-defined dataset of MEK1 metazoan orthologs, which provides sufficient depth to distinguish between conserved and variable amino acid positions. We used this dataset to match known and predicted disease-causing and benign mutations to evolutionary changes observed in corresponding amino acid positions. We found that all known and the vast majority of suspected disease-causing mutations are evolutionarily intolerable. We selected several MEK1 mutations that cannot be unambiguously assessed by automated variant prediction tools, but that are confidently identified as evolutionary intolerant and thus \"damaging\" by our approach, for experimental validation in Drosophila. In all cases, evolutionary intolerant variants caused increased mortality and severe defects in fruit fly embryos confirming their damaging nature predicted by out computational strategy. We anticipate that our analysis will serve as a blueprint to help evaluate known and novel missense variants in MEK1 and that our approach will contribute to improving automated tools for disease-associated variant interpretation.\n\nSignificance StatementHigh-throughput genome sequencing has significantly improved diagnosis, management, and treatment of genetic diseases and cancers. However, in addition to its indisputable utility, genome sequencing produces many variants that cannot be easily interpreted - so called variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Various automated bioinformatics tools can help predicting functional consequences of VUS, but their accuracy is relatively low. Here, by tracing precise evolutionary history of each amino acid position in MEK1 kinase, mutations in which cause neurodegenerative diseases and cancer in humans, we can establish whether VUS seen in humans are evolutionarily tolerant. Using published data and newly performed experiments in an animal model, we show that evolutionarily tolerable variants in MEK1 are benign, whereas intolerable substitutions are damaging. Our approach will help in diagnostics of MEK1-associated diseases, it is generalizable to many other disease-associated genes, and it can help improving automated predictors.",

    "abstract": "Several coronaviruses infect humans, with three, including the SARS-CoV2, causing diseases. While coronaviruses are especially prone to induce pandemics, we know little about their evolutionary history, host-to-host transmissions, and biogeography, which impedes the prediction of future transmission scenarios. One of the difficulties lies in dating the origination of the family, a particularly challenging task for RNA viruses in general. Previous cophylogenetic tests of virus-host associations, including in the Coronaviridae family, have suggested a virus-host codiversification history stretching many millions of years. Here, we establish a framework for robustly testing scenarios of ancient origination and codiversification versus recent origination and diversification by host switches. Applied to coronaviruses and their mammalian hosts, our results support a scenario of recent origination of coronaviruses in bats and diversification by host switches, with preferential host switches within mammalian orders. Hotspots of coronavirus diversity, concentrated in East Asia and Europe, are consistent with this scenario of relatively recent origination and localized host switches. Spillovers from bats to other species are rare, but have the highest probability to be towards humans than to any other mammal species, implicating humans as the evolutionary intermediate host. The high host-switching rates within orders, as well as between humans, domesticated mammals, and non-flying wild mammals, indicates the potential for rapid additional spreading of coronaviruses across the world. Our results suggest that the evolutionary history of extant mammalian coronaviruses is recent, and that cases of long-term virus-host codiversification have been largely over-estimated.",

    "abstract": "In the ongoing debates about eukaryogenesis, the series of evolutionary events leading to the emergence of the eukaryotic cell from prokaryotic ancestors, members of the Asgard archaea play a key role as the closest archaeal relatives of eukaryotes. However, the nature and phylogenetic identity of the last common ancestor of Asgard archaea and eukaryotes remain unresolved. Here, we analyze distinct phylogenetic marker datasets of an expanded genomic sampling of Asgard archaea and evaluate competing evolutionary scenarios using state-of-the-art phylogenomic approaches. We find that eukaryotes are placed, with high confidence, as a well-nested clade within Asgard archaea, as a sister lineage to Hodarchaeales, a newly proposed order within Heimdallarchaeia. Using sophisticated gene tree/species tree reconciliation approaches, we show that, in analogy to the evolution of eukaryotic genomes, genome evolution in Asgard archaea involved significantly more gene duplication and fewer gene loss events compared to other archaea. Finally, we infer that the last common ancestor of Asgard archaea likely was a thermophilic chemolithotroph, and that the lineage from which eukaryotes evolved adapted to mesophilic conditions and acquired the genetic potential to support a heterotrophic lifestyle. Our work provides key insights into the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition and the platform for the emergence of cellular complexity in eukaryotic cells.",

    "abstract": "An increasing number of mutations associated with devastating human diseases are diagnosed by whole-genome/exon sequencing. Recurrent de novo missense mutations have been discovered in B56{delta} (encoded by PPP2R5D), a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), that cause intellectual disabilities (ID), macrocephaly, Parkinsonism, and a broad range of neurological symptoms. Single-particle cryo-EM structures show that the PP2A-B56{delta} holoenzyme possesses closed latent and open active forms. In the closed form, the long, disordered arms of B56{delta} termini fold against each other and the holoenzyme core, establishing dual autoinhibition of the phosphatase active site and the substrate-binding protein groove. The resulting interface spans over 190 [A] and harbors unfavorable contacts, activation phosphorylation sites, and nearly all residues with ID-associated mutations. Our studies suggest that this dynamic interface is close to an allosteric network responsive to activation phosphorylation and altered globally by mutations. Furthermore, we found that ID mutations perturb the activation phosphorylation rates, and the severe variants significantly increase the mitotic duration and error rates compared to the wild variant.",

    "abstract": "The Hippo pathway controls tissue growth and regulates stem cell fate through the activities of core kinase cassette that begins with the Sterile 20-like kinase MST1/2. Activation of MST1/2 relies on trans-autophosphorylation but the details of the mechanisms regulating that reaction are not fully elucidated. Proposals include dimerization as a first step and include multiple models for potential kinase-domain dimers. Efforts to verify and link these dimers to trans-autophosphorylation were unsuccessful. We explored the link between dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation for MST2 and the entire family of MST kinases. We analyzed crystal lattice contacts of structures of MST kinases and identified an ensemble of kinase-domain dimers compatible with trans-autophosphorylation. These dimers share a common dimerization interface comprised of the activation loop and G-helix while the arrangements of the kinase-domains within the dimer varied depending on their activation state. We then verified the dimerization interface and determined its function using MST2. Variants bearing alanine substitutions of the G-helix prevented dimerization of the MST2 kinase domain both in solution and in cells. These substitutions also blocked autophosphorylation of full-length MST2 and its Drosophila homolog Hippo in cells. These variants retain the same secondary structure as wild-type and capacity to phosphorylate a protein substrate, indicating the loss of MST2 activation can be directly attributed to a loss of dimerization rather than loss of either fold or catalytic function. Together this data functionally links dimerization and autophosphorylation for MST2 and suggests this activation mechanism is conserved across both species and the entire MST family.",

    "abstract": "Given the emergence of antimicrobial drug resistance, it is critical to understand the heterogeneity of response to an antibiotic within a population of cells. Since the drug can exert a selection pressure that leads to the emergence of resistant phenotypes. To date, neither bulk nor single-cell methods are able to link the heterogeneity of single-cell susceptibility to the population-scale response to antibiotics. Here we present a platform that measures the ability of individual E. coli cells to form small colonies at different ciprofloxacin concentrations, by using anchored microfluidic drops and an image and data analysis pipelines. The microfluidic results are benchmarked against classical microbiology measurements of antibiotic susceptibility, showing an agreement between the pooled microfluidic chip and replated bulk measurements. Further, the experimental likelihood of a single cell to form a colony is used to provide a probabilistic antibiotic susceptibility curve. In addition to the probabilistic viewpoint, the microfluidic format enables the characterization of morphological features over time for a large number of individual cells. This pipeline can be used to compare the response of different bacterial strains to antibiotics with different action mechanisms.",

Here, we show that most long-B pAgos constitute cell suicide systems together with their various associated proteins, including nucleases, Sir2-domain-containing proteins and trans-membrane proteins, respectively. Among them, the long-B pAgo-nuclease system utilizes an RNA-programmed and target-recognition-activated collateral DNA cleavage activity to sense invaders and kill the infected cells. This results in depletion of the invading plasmid from the cell population.

    "abstract": "Intestinal microbes impact the health of the intestine and organs distal to the gut. Limosilactobacillus reuteri is a human intestinal microbe that promotes normal gut transit1, the anti-inflammatory immune system2-4, wound healing5-7, normal social behavior in mice8-10, and prevents bone reabsorption11-17. Each of these functions is impacted by oxytocin18-22, and oxytocin signaling is required for L. reuteri-mediated wound healing5 and social behavior9; however, the initiating events in the gut that lead to oxytocin stimulation and related beneficial functions remain unknown. Here we found evolutionarily conserved oxytocin production in the intestinal epithelium through analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq datasets and imaging of human and mouse intestinal tissues. Moreover, human intestinal organoids produce oxytocin, demonstrating that the intestinal epithelium is sufficient to produce oxytocin. We subsequently found that L. reuteri facilitates oxytocin secretion directly from human intestinal tissue and human intestinal organoids. Finally, we demonstrate that stimulation of oxytocin secretion by L. reuteri is dependent on the gut hormone secretin, which is produced in enteroendocrine cells23, while oxytocin itself is produced in enterocytes. Altogether, this work demonstrates that oxytocin is produced and secreted from enterocytes in the intestinal epithelium in response to secretin stimulated by L. reuteri. This work thereby identifies oxytocin as an intestinal hormone and provides mechanistic insight into avenues by which gut microbes promote host health.",

    "abstract": "Industrialization has transformed the gut microbiota, reducing the prevalence of Prevotella relative to Bacteroides. Here, we isolate Bacteroides and Prevotella strains from the microbiota of Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania, a population with high levels of Prevotella. We demonstrate that plant-derived microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) are required for persistence of Prevotella copri but not Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron in vivo. Differences in carbohydrate metabolism gene content, expression, and in vitro growth reveal that Hadza Prevotella strains specialize in degrading plant carbohydrates, while Hadza Bacteroides isolates use both plant and host-derived carbohydrates, a difference mirrored in Bacteroides from non-Hadza populations. When competing directly, P. copri requires plant-derived MACs to maintain colonization in the presence of B. thetaiotaomicron, as a no MAC diet eliminates P. copri colonization. Prevotellas reliance on plant-derived MACs and Bacteroides ability to use host mucus carbohydrates could explain the reduced prevalence of Prevotella in populations consuming a low-MAC, industrialized diet.\n\nStatement on work with indigenous communitiesIn order to acquire scientific knowledge that accurately represents all human populations, rather than only reflecting and benefiting those in industrialized nations, it is necessary to involve indigenous populations in research in a legal, ethical, and non-exploitative manner (Abdill et al., 2022; Green et al., 2020).

    "abstract": "Potato brown rot, caused by Ralstonia solanacearum, is one of the most destructive diseases of potatoes. The pathogen could hide in the tuber, leading to the rotting tubers. However, few mechanisms of pathogenesis in tubers caused by brown rot were reported. Here, we identified a highly virulent type III effector RipBH, which is not only required for the pathogenesis of potato brown rot but also displays strong cell toxicity in yeast and tobacco. We found RipBH is a novel structural cysteine protease with a large ankyrin repeat domain that contains 10 ankyrin repeats, we named it as an ankyrin cysteine protease. Biochemical analysis showed that all the ankyrin repeats are required for virulence, and the first five ankyrin repeats are indispensable for auto-cleavage site recognition. Further analysis showed that RipBH triggered autophagy-associated cell death. The ankyrin cysteine protease effector existed extensively in plant and animal pathogens suggesting the ankyrin cysteine protease effectors are functionally essential for pathogen pathogenesis. Our study enhances our understanding of this type of cysteine protease and illustrates the pathogenesis of cysteine protease in potato brown rot.",

    "abstract": "Kaposis sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) ORF34 is a component of the viral pre-initiation complex (vPIC), a highly conserved piece of machinery essential for late gene expression among beta- and gamma-herpes viruses. KSHV ORF34 is also estimated to be a hub protein, associated with the majority of vPIC components. However, the precise mechanisms underlying how the ORF34 molecule contributes to the vPIC function, including the binding manner to other vPIC components, remain unclear. Therefore, we constructed ORF34 alanine-scanning mutants, in which amino-acid residues that were conserved among other herpesviruses had been replaced by alanine. The mutants were analyzed for their binding functions to other vPIC factors, and then were evaluated for their recovering ability of viral production using the cells harboring ORF34-deficient KSHV-BAC. The results demonstrated that at least four cysteines conserved in ORF34 were crucial for binding to other vPIC components, ORF24 and ORF66, virus production, and late gene transcription and expression. Based on the amino acid sequence of ORF34, these four cysteines were expected to constitute a pair of C-Xn-C consensus motifs. An artificial intelligence-predicted structure model revealed that the four cysteines were present tetrahedrally in an intramolecular fashion. Another prediction algorithm indicated the possible capture of metal cations by ORF34. Furthermore, it was experimentally observed that the elimination of cations by a selective chelator resulted in the loss of ORF34s binding ability to other vPIC components. In conclusion, our results suggest the functional importance of KSHV ORF34 conserved cysteines for vPIC components assembly and viral replication.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe gamma- and beta-herpesvirus family conserve the viral-factor based mechanism for initiating viral late gene transcription. This viral pre-initiation complex (vPIC) is a functional analog to cellular PIC consisting of general transcriptional factors. We focused on KSHV ORF34, an essential factor for viral replication as a vPIC component. The precise mechanism underlying vPIC formation and critical domain structure of ORF34 for its function are presently unclear. Therefore, we investigated the contribution of conserved amino-acid residues among ORF34 homologs to virus production, late gene expression, and interaction with other vPIC components. We demonstrated for the first time that four conserved cysteines (C170, C175, C256, and C259) in ORF34 are essential for vPIC formation, late gene transcription, and viral production. Importantly, the predicted structure model and biochemical experiment provide evidence showing that these four conserved cysteines are present in a tetrahedral formation which helped to maintain metal cation.",

Despite development of FISH methods for plants, easy and reliable whole mount FISH protocols have not yet been reported. We adapt a 3-day whole mount RNA-FISH method for plant species based on a combination of prior protocols that employs hybridization chain reaction (HCR), which amplifies the probe signal in an antibody-free manner. Our whole mount HCR RNA-FISH method shows expected spatial signals with low background for gene transcripts with known spatial expression patterns in Arabidopsis inflorescences and monocot roots. It allows simultaneous detection of three transcripts in 3D. We also show that HCR RNA-FISH can be combined with endogenous fluorescent protein detection and with our improved immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocol.

However, little is known about the regulation and potential cardiometabolic functions of N-acyl amino acids in humans. Here, we analyze the cardiometabolic phenotype associations and genetic regulation of four plasma N-fatty acyl amino acids (N-oleoyl-leucine, N-oleoyl-phenylalanine, N-oleoyl-serine, and N-oleoyl-glycine) in 2,351 individuals from the Jackson Heart Study. N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine were positively associated with traits related to energy balance, including body mass index, waist circumference, and subcutaneous adipose tissue. In addition, we identify the CYP4F2 locus as a human-specific genetic determinant of plasma N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine levels. In vitro, CYP4F2-mediated hydroxylation of N-oleoyl-leucine and N-oleoyl-phenylalanine results in metabolic diversification and production of many previously unknown lipid metabolites with varying characteristics of the fatty acid tail group, including several that structurally resemble fatty acid hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs). By contrast, FAAH-regulated N-oleoyl-glycine and N-oleoyl-serine were inversely associated with traits related to glucose and lipid homeostasis. These data uncover a human-specific enzymatic node for the metabolism of a subset of N-fatty acyl amino acids and establish a framework for understanding the cardiometabolic roles of individual N-fatty acyl amino acids in humans.",

    "abstract": "Pathological deposition and crosslinking of collagen type I by activated myofibroblasts drives progressive tissue fibrosis. Therapies that inhibit collagen synthesis by myofibroblasts have clinical potential as anti-fibrotic agents. Lysine hydroxylation by the prolyl-3-hydroxylase complex, comprised of cartilage associated protein, prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1, and cyclophilin B, is essential for collagen type I crosslinking and formation of stable fibers. Here, we identify the collagen chaperone cyclophilin B as a major cellular target of the macrocyclic natural product sanglifehrin A (SfA) using photo-affinity labeling and chemical proteomics. Our studies reveal a unique mechanism of action in which SfA binding to cyclophilin B in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induces the secretion of cyclophilin B to the extracellular space, preventing TGF-{beta}1-activated myofibroblasts from synthesizing collagen type I in vitro without inhibiting collagen type I mRNA transcription or inducing ER stress. In addition, SfA prevents collagen type I secretion without affecting myofibroblast contractility or TGF-{beta}1 signaling. In vivo, we provide chemical, molecular, functional, and translational evidence that SfA mitigates the development of lung and skin fibrosis in mouse models by inducing cyclophilin B secretion, thereby inhibiting collagen synthesis from fibrotic fibroblasts in vivo. Consistent with these findings in preclinical models, SfA reduces collagen type I secretion from fibrotic human lung fibroblasts and precision cut lung slices from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a fatal fibrotic lung disease with limited therapeutic options. Our results identify the primary liganded target of SfA in cells, the collagen chaperone cyclophilin B, as a new mechanistic target for the treatment of organ fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "As a next-generation toolkit, microrobots can transform a wide range of fields, including micromanufacturing, electronics, microfluidics, tissue engineering, and medicine. While still in their infancy, acoustically actuated wireless microrobots are becoming increasingly attractive, as acoustic control can generate large propulsive forces, requires relatively simple microrobot design, and does not entail complex manipulation systems. However, the interaction of acoustics with microstructure geometry is poorly understood to date, and its study is necessary for developing next-generation acoustically powered microrobots. We present here a mass-manufactured acoustically driven helical microrobot capable of locomotion using a fin-like double-helix microstructure. This microrobot responds to sound stimuli and mimics the spiral motion of natural microswimmers such as spirochetes. The asymmetric double helix interacts with the incident acoustic field, inducing a propulsion torque that causes the microrobot to rotate around its long axis. Moreover, our microrobot has the unique feature of its directionality being switchable by simply tuning the acoustic frequency. We demonstrate this locomotion in 2D and 3D artificial vasculatures using a single sound source. Since ultrasound is widely used as an imaging modality in clinical settings, our robotic system can integrate seamlessly into practice; thus, our findings could contribute to the development of next-generation smart microrobots.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryWe present an acoustically driven helical microrobot capable of corkscrew-like locomotion using a double-helix microstructure.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages (phages) within the Przondovirus genus are T7-like podoviruses belonging to the Studiervirinae subfamily, within the Autographiviridae family and have a highly conserved genome organisation. The genome size of these phages ranges from 37 kb to 42 kb, encode 50-60 genes and are characterised by the presence of direct terminal repeats (DTRs) flanking the linear chromosome. These DTRs are often deleted during short-read-only and hybrid assemblies. Moreover, long-read-only assemblies are often littered with sequencing and/or assembly errors and require additional curation. Here, we present the isolation and characterisation of ten novel przondoviruses targeting Klebsiella spp. We describe HYPPA - a HYbrid and Poly-polish Phage Assembly workflow, which utilises long-read assemblies in combination with short-read sequencing to resolve phage DTRs and correcting errors, negating the need for laborious primer walking and Sanger sequencing validation. Our data demonstrate the importance of careful curation of phage assemblies before publication, and prior to using them for comparative genomics.\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTThe current workflows employed for phage genome assembly are often error-prone and can lead to many incomplete phage genomes being deposited within databases. This can create challenges when performing comparative genomics, and may also lead to incorrect taxonomic assignment. To overcome these challenges we proposed HYPPA, a workflow that can produce complete and high-quality phage genomes without the need for laborious lab-based validation.\n\nDATA SUMMARYPhage raw reads are available from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive (NCBI-SRA) under the BioProject number PRJNA914245. Phage annotated genomes have been deposited at GenBank under the accessions OQ579023-OQ579032 (Table 1). Bacterial WGS data for clinical preterm infant samples have been deposited at GenBank under BioProject accession PRJNA471164 (Table S1). Bacterial raw reads for food samples are available from NCBI-SRA with individual accessions (SAMN33593347-SAMN33593351), and can be found under the BioProject number PRJNA941224 (Table S1). Strain-specific details for bacteria and publicly-available phages used in these analyses, along with accessions for the latter can be found in Table S1 and Table S6, respectively.

    "abstract": "Chronic infection of the common bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently leads to the coexistence of heterogeneous individuals to engage in several group behaviors. However, further evolution of the polymorphic P. aeruginosa population, including the dynamic change of social cooperation and its impact on host immune system, still remain elusive. We show that the evolution of P. aeruginosa in the patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease frequently selects the isolates deficient in producing the costly and sharable extracellular products for nutrient acquisition. The evolution of polymorphic P. aeruginosa population is mainly concentrated on modifying the adaptability of lasR mutants, which are typical cheaters in the competition of quorum-sensing-controlled extracellular proteases. Importantly, lasR mutants with varying degrees of evolution interact with wild-type P. aeruginosa in a framework termed cascaded public goods game to compete for extracellular proteases and siderophores, and thus perpetuate social cooperation under different conditions. Finally, we find that a polymorphic population comprised of lasR-intact P. aeruginosa and evolved lasR-mutant can minimize the host immune fluctuation for persistent colonization. This study demonstrates the multistage evolution and complex interaction of P. aeruginosa in adaptation to host lungs, and provides an explanation for the success of cooperation in public goods game.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIL-23 is central to the pathogenesis of psoriasis, and is structurally comprised of p19 and p40 subunits. \"Targeted\" IL-23 inhibitors risankizumab, tildrakizumab, and guselkumab differ mechanistically from ustekinumab because they bind p19, whereas ustekinumab binds p40; however, a knowledge gap exists regarding the structural composition of their epitopes and how these molecular properties relate to their clinical efficacy.\n\nObjectivesTo characterize and differentiate the structural epitopes of the IL-23 inhibitors risankizumab, guselkumab, tildrakinumab, and ustekinumab, and correlate their molecular characteristics with clinical response in plaque psoriasis therapy.\n\nMethodsWe utilized epitope data derived from hydrogen-deuterium exchange studies for risankizumab, tildrakizumab, and guselkumab, and crystallographic data for ustekinumab to map drug epitope locations, hydrophobicity, and surface charge onto the IL-23 molecular surface (Protein Data Bank ID Code 3D87) using UCSF Chimera. PDBePISA was used to calculate solvent accessible surface area (SASA). Epitope composition was determined by classifying residues as acidic, basic, polar, or hydrophobic and calculating their contribution to epitope SASA. Linear regression and analysis of variance was performed.\n\nResultsAll the p19-specific inhibitor epitopes differ in location and size, with risankizumab and guselkumab having large epitope surface areas (SA), and tildrakizumab and ustekinumab having smaller SA. The tildrakizumab epitope was mostly hydrophobic (56%), while guselkumab, risankizumab, and ustekinumab epitopes displayed >50% non-hydrophobic residues. Risankizumab and ustekinumab exhibited acidic surface charges, while tildrakizumab and guselkumab were net neutral. Each inhibitor binds an epitope with a unique size and composition, and with mostly distinct locations except for a 10-residue overlap region that lies outside of the IL-23 receptor epitope. We observed a strong correlation between epitope SA and PASI-90 rates (R2 = 0.9969, p = 0.0016), as well as between epitope SA and KD (R2 = 0.9772, p = 0.0115). In contrast, we found that total epitope hydrophobicity, polarity, and charge content do not correlate with clinical efficacy.\n\nConclusionsStructural analysis of IL-23 inhibitor epitopes reveals strong association between epitope SA and early drug efficacy in plaque psoriasis therapy, exemplifying how molecular data can explain clinical observations, inform future innovation, and help clinicians in specific drug selection for patients.",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) drive many cellular processes. Some PPIs are directed by Src homology 3 (SH3) domains that bind proline-rich motifs on other proteins. The evolution of the binding specificity of SH3 domains is not completely understood, particularly following gene duplication. Paralogous genes accumulate mutations that can modify protein functions and, for SH3 domains, their binding preferences. Here, we examined how the binding of the SH3 domains of two paralogous yeast type I myosins, Myo3 and Myo5, evolved following duplication. We found that the paralogs have subtly different SH3-dependent interaction profiles. However, by swapping SH3 domains between the paralogs and by characterizing the SH3 domains freed from their protein context, we find that very few of the differences in interactions, if any, depend on the SH3 domains themselves. We used ancestral sequence reconstruction to resurrect the pre-duplication SH3 domains and examined, moving back in time, how the binding preference changed. Although the closest ancestor of the two domains had a very similar binding preference as the extant ones, older ancestral domains displayed a gradual loss of interaction with the modern interaction partners when inserted in the extant paralogs. Molecular docking and experimental characterization of the free ancestral domains showed that their affinity with the proline motifs is likely not the cause for this loss of binding. Taken together, our results suggest that the SH3 and its host protein could create intramolecular or allosteric interactions essential for the SH3-dependent PPIs, making domains not functionally equivalent even when they have the same binding specificity.",

    "abstract": "Second-generation (2G) ethanol is one potential biofuel that could be used to achieve the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Many challenges still need to be overcome for the feasibility of this technology, most of them related to consumption of xylose, a pentose sugar not easily metabolized by industrial microorganisms. Thus, exploring genes, pathways and other organisms that can ferment xylose is a strategy implemented to solve industrial bottlenecks. Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum (T. sac) is an organism from the firmicutes phylum, capable of naturally fermenting compounds of industrial interest, such as xylan and xylose. Understanding evolutionary adaptations may help not only to solidify this bacterium as a potential substitute to the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in industry, but also bring novel genes and information that can be used for yeast, enhance its fermenting capabilities, and increase production of current bio-platforms. This study presents a deep evolutionary study of members of the firmicutes clade, focusing on adaptations that may be related to overall fermentation metabolism, especially for xylose fermentation. One highlight is the finding of positive selection on a xylose binding protein of the xylFGH operon, close to the annotated sugar binding site, with this protein already being found to be expressed in xylose fermenting conditions in a previous study. Results from this study can serve as basis for searching for candidate genes to use in industrial strains or to improve T. sac as a new microbial cell factory, which may help to solve current problems found in the biofuels industry.",

    "abstract": "Vascular network formation requires the fusion of newly formed blood vessels and the emergence of a patent lumen between the newly established connections so that blood flow can start. Lumen formation has been shown to depend on the late endosomal/lysosomal pathway in various organs of animal tubular systems. Here, we identified a late endosomal/lysosomal vesicular fraction (Rab7/Lamp2) in early zebrafish angiogenic sprouts, which appears to contribute to apical membrane growth during lumen formation. To study the effect of the late endocytic pathway on vascular development, we generated mutant alleles for all three rab7 genes in zebrafish (rab7a, rab7ba, rab7bb). All rab7 genes are expressed in wild-type zebrafish and we did not detect any compensatory effects by the other rab7 isoforms in single knockout mutants, which were all viable. Only the triple mutant was lethal suggesting some functional redundancy. However, the different rab7 isoforms fulfil also at least partially independent functions because eggs laid from mothers lacking two rab7 (rab7a and/or rab7bb). showed reduced survival and contained enlarged yolk granules, suggesting maternal contribution of these two rab7. Finally, we observed minor effects on lumen formation in embryos which still express one copy of rab7. Our results support the notion that the late endocytic/lysosomal compartment contributes to lumen expansion.",

In this study, we used covalent chemoproteomic platforms to map the proteome-wide reactivity of OPA in a highly sensitive lung cancer cell line. Among several proteins that OPA engaged, we focused on two targets--cysteine C53 of HIG2DA and lysine K72 of COX5A--that are part of complex IV of the electron transport chain and contributed significantly to the anti-proliferative activity. OPA activated mitochondrial respiration in a HIG2DA and COX5A-dependent manner, led to an initial spike in mitochondrial ATP, but then compromised mitochondrial membrane potential leading to ATP depletion. We have used chemoproteomic strategies to discover a unique anti-cancer mechanism of OPA through activation of complex IV leading to compromised mitochondrial energetics and rapid cell death.",

    "abstract": "Validating associations between genotypic and phenotypic variation remains a challenge, despite advancements in association studies. Common approaches for signal validation rely on gene-level perturbations, such as loss-of-function mutations or RNAi, which test the effect of genetic modifications usually not observed in nature. CRISPR-based methods can validate associations at the SNP level, but have significant drawbacks, including resulting off-target effects and being both time-consuming and expensive. Both approaches usually modify the genome of a single genetic background, limiting the generalizability of experiments. To address these challenges, we present a simple, low-cost experimental scheme for validating genetic associations at the SNP level in outbred populations. The approach involves genotyping live outbred individuals at a focal SNP, crossing homozygous individuals with the same genotype at that locus, and contrasting phenotypes across resulting synthetic outbred populations. We tested this method in Drosophila melanogaster, measuring the longevity effects of a polymorphism at a naturally-segregating cis-eQTL for the midway gene. Our results demonstrate the utility of this method in SNP-level validation of naturally occurring genetic variation regulating complex traits. This method provides a bridge between the statistical discovery of genotype-phenotype associations and their validation in the natural context of heterogeneous genomic contexts.",

We found that serotonin release from DRN to the OFC promotes reversal learning. A long-range connection between these two brain regions was confirmed anatomically and functionally. We further show that spatiotemporally precise serotonergic action directly enhances the excitability of OFC neurons and offers enhanced spike probability of OFC network. Serotonergic action facilitated the induction of synaptic plasticity by enhancing Ca2+ influx at dendritic spines in the OFC.

    "abstract": "Abnormal dendritic arbors, dendritic spine \"dysgenesis\" and excitation inhibition imbalance are main traits assumed to underlie impaired cognition and behavioral adaptation in intellectual disability. However, how these modifications actually contribute to functional properties of neuronal networks, such as signal integration or storage capacity is unknown. Here, we used a mouse model overexpressing Dyrk1A (Dual-specificity tyrosine [Y]-regulated kinase), one of the most relevant Down syndrome (DS) candidate genes, to gather quantitative data regarding hippocampal neuronal deficits produced by the overexpression of Dyrk1A in mice (TgDyrk1A; TG). TG mice showed impaired hippocampal recognition memory, altered excitation-inhibition balance and deficits in hippocampal CA1 LTP. We also detected for the first time that deficits in dendritic arborization in TG CA1 pyramidal neurons are layer-specific, with a reduction in the width of the stratum radiatum, the postsynaptic target site of CA3 excitatory neurons, but not in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare, which receives temporo-ammonic projections. To interrogate about the functional impact of layer-specific TG dendritic deficits we developed tailored computational multicompartmental models. Computational modelling revealed that neuronal microarchitecture alterations in TG mice lead to deficits in storage capacity, altered the integration of inputs from entorhinal cortex and hippocampal CA3 region onto CA1 pyramidal cells, important for coding place and temporal context and on connectivity and activity dynamics, with impaired the ability to reach high {gamma} oscillations. Contrary to what is assumed in the field, the reduced network activity in TG is mainly contributed by the deficits in neuronal architecture and to a lesser extent by over-inhibition. Finally, given that therapies aimed at improving cognition have also been tested for their capability to recover dendritic spine deficits and excitation-inhibition imbalance, we also tested the short- and long-term changes produced by exposure to environmental enrichment (EE). Exposure to EE normalized the excitation inhibition imbalance and LTP, and had beneficial effects on short-term recognition memory. Importantly, it produced massive but transient dendritic remodeling of hippocampal CA1, that led to recovery of high {gamma} oscillations, the main readout of synchronization of CA1 neurons, in our simulations. However, those effects where not stable and were lost after EE discontinuation. We conclude that layer-specific neuromorphological disturbances produced by Dyrk1A overexpression impair coding place and temporal context. Our results also suggest that treatments targeting structural plasticity, such as EE, even though hold promise towards improved treatment of intellectual disabilities, only produce temporary recovery, due to transient dendritic remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) encode a rich repertoire of task-relevant environmental features, while downstream regions such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) translate this information into task-adaptive behaviors. Yet, the contents of this information stream and their acute role in behavior remain largely unknown. Here, we used in vivo dual-color two-photon imaging to simultaneously record from both large numbers of hippocampal neurons and an identified subpopulation of NAc-projecting neurons during goal-directed navigation towards a hidden reward zone. We found that NAc-projecting neurons contain enriched spatial information and enhanced representations of non-spatial task-relevant behaviors such as deceleration and appetitive licking, both of which could be elicited by optogenetic activation of dHPC terminals in NAc. A generalized linear model revealed enhanced conjunctive coding in NAc-projecting dHPC neurons, improving the identification of the reward zone. We propose that dHPC routes specific reward-related spatial and behavioral state information to guide NAc action selection.",

    "abstract": "RationaleIn a social context, individuals are able to detect external information from others and coordinate behavioral responses according to the situation, a phenomenon called social decision-making. Social decision-making is multifaceted, influenced by emotional and motivational factors like stress, sickness and hunger. However, the neurobiological basis for motivational state competition and interaction are not well known.\n\nObjectiveWe investigated possible neural mechanisms through which internal states could shape social behavior in a social affective preference (SAP) test. In the SAP test, experimental rats given a choice to interact with naive or stressed conspecifics exhibit an age-dependent preference to interact with stressed juvenile conspecifics, but avoid stressed adult conspecifics. First, we assessed the effect of hunger on SAP behavior. Behavior in the SAP test requires the insular cortex, which receives input from the hunger-related peptides melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin neurons of the lateral hypothalamus (LH). This study aimed to evaluate the role of LH and insular MCH and orexin in SAP test.\n\nMethodsSAP tests were conducted in rats that were sated, food deprived or allowed 1 h of access to food after 14 h of deprivation (relieved condition). Separate cohorts of sated rats received cannula implants for microinjection of drugs to inhibit the LH or to block or stimulate MCH or orexin receptors in the insula prior to SAP tests or social interaction tests.\n\nResultsFood and water deprivation prior to SAP tests with juvenile rats caused a shift in preference away from the stressed rat toward the naive juveniles. Pharmacological inhibition of LH with muscimol (100 ng/side) abolished the preference for the juvenile stressed conspecific, as well as the preference for the adult naive conspecific. The blockade of MCHr1 or orexin receptors in the insular cortex with SNAP94847 (50{micro}M) or TCS1102 (1{micro}M), respectively, also abolished the preference for the stressed juvenile conspecific, but only the antagonism of orexin receptors was able to abolish the preference for the adult naive conspecific. Microinjection of increasing doses (50 or 500 nM) of MCH or orexin-A in the insular cortex increased the interaction time in the one-on-one social interactions test with juvenile conspecifics, however only the microinjection of orexin-A increased the interaction time with adult naive conspecifics.\n\nConclusionsTaken together, these results suggest that lateral hypothalamus peptides shape the direction of social approach or avoidance via actions MCH and orexin neurotransmission in the insular cortex.",
