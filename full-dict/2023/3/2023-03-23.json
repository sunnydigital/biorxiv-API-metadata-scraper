    "abstract": "Pannexin 3 (Panx3) is a glycoprotein that forms mechanosensitive channels expressed in chondrocytes and annulus fibrosus cells of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Evidence suggests Panx3 plays contrasting roles in traumatic versus aging osteoarthritis (OA) and intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). However, whether its deletion influences the response of joint tissue to mechanical stress is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine if Panx3 deletion in mice causes increased knee joint OA and IDD after forced treadmill running. Male and female wildtype (WT) and Panx3 knockout (KO) mice were randomized to either a no exercise group (sedentary; SED) or daily forced treadmill running (forced exercise; FEX) from 24 to 30 weeks of age. Knee cartilage, tibial secondary ossification center and IVD histopathology were evaluated by histology. Both male and female Panx3 KO mice developed larger superficial defects of the tibial cartilage after forced treadmill running compared to SED WT mice. Additionally, both male and female Panx3 KO mice developed greater bone area of the tibial secondary ossification center with running. In the lower lumbar spine, both male and female Panx3 KO mice developed histopathological features of IDD after running compared to SED WT mice. These findings suggest that the combination of deleting Panx3 and forced treadmill running induces OA and causes histopathological changes associated with degeneration of the IVDs in mice.",

    "abstract": "Amino acid auxotrophies are prevalent among bacteria. They can govern ecological dynamics in microbial communities and indicate metabolic cross-feeding interactions among coexisting genotypes. Despite the ecological importance of auxotrophies, their distribution and impact on the diversity and function of the human gut microbiome remain poorly understood. This study performed the first systematic analysis of the distribution of amino acid auxotrophies in the human gut microbiome using a combined metabolomic, metagenomic, and metabolic modeling approach. Results showed that amino acid auxotrophies are ubiquitous in the colon microbiome, with tryptophan auxotrophy being the most common. Auxotrophy frequencies were found to be higher for those amino acids, that are also essential to the human host. Moreover, a higher overall abundance of auxotrophies was associated with greater microbiome diversity and stability, and the distribution of auxotrophs was found to be related to the human hosts metabolome, including trimethylamine oxide, small aromatic acids, and secondary bile acids. Thus, our results suggest that amino acid auxotrophies are important factors that contribute to microbiome ecology and host-microbiome metabolic interactions.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, sex determination is controlled by antagonistic gene cascades operating in embryonic undifferentiated gonads1 2. The expression of the Y-linked gene SRY is sufficient to trigger the testicular pathway, whereas its absence in XX embryos leads to ovarian differentiation3 4 5. Despite this strong genetic component, the involvement of non-coding regulation in determining mammalian sex remains unclear6. Here we show that the deletion of a single microRNA cluster, miR-17[~]92, induces complete primary male-to-female sex reversal in XY mice. Time-course analyses revealed that Sry is heterochronically expressed, showing a delay in XY miR-17[~]92 knockout gonads, which subsequently activate the ovarian genetic program. Bulk and single cell RNA-seq analyses showed that Sertoli cell differentiation is reduced, delayed and unable to sustain the testicular fate. This disrupted differentiation results from a transient state of sex ambiguity in pre-supporting cells, which is later resolved towards the ovarian fate. Consistent with known mechanisms of miRNA-mediated gene regulation, the expression of miR-17[~]92 target genes is not stabilized in undifferentiated XY mutant gonads, affecting concomitantly the fine regulation of gene networks with critical roles in developing gonads. Our results demonstrate that microRNAs are key components for mammalian sex determination, controlling the timing of Sry expression and Sertoli cell differentiation.",

    "abstract": "During development, in the embryo proper blood cells emerge from a subset of specialized endothelial cells, named hemogenic endothelial cells (HECs), via a process known as endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) driven by time-specific Notch signaling activation1. HECs represent an elusive cell population as they are rare and transient, rapidly generating blood cells, and specific markers are lacking. Therefore, it remains unclear how and when the hematopoietic fate is specified and how blood cell emergence is molecularly regulated. Notably, thorough characterization of this process is essential to guide the generation of therapeutic blood products in vitro from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). To identify specific human HEC markers, we performed transcriptomic analysis of 28-32-day human embryos, a developmental stage characterized by active hematopoiesis. We observed that the expression of FCGR2B, encoding for the Fc receptor CD32, is highly enriched in the ACE+CD34+ endothelial cell population that contains HECs. Functional ex vivo analyses confirmed that multilineage hematopoietic potential is highly enriched in CD32+ endothelial cells isolated from human embryos. In addition, clonal analysis revealed that 90% of CD32+ hPSC-derived endothelial cells are bona fide HECs. We leveraged this specificity to study how HECs commit to the blood fate. Remarkably, our analyses indicated that HECs progress through different states culminating with the one identified by CD32 expression. Indeed CD32+ HECs no longer require Notch to generate hematopoietic progeny and display full commitment to hematopoiesis even before the expression of hematopoietic markers. These findings provide a precise method for isolating HECs primed to the blood fate from human embryos and hPSC cultures, thus allowing the efficient generation of hematopoietic cells in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale commercial harvesting and climate-induced fluctuations in ocean properties shape the dynamics of marine populations as interdependent drivers at varied timescales. Selective removals of larger, older members of a population can distort its demographic structure, eroding resilience to fluctuations in habitat conditions and thus amplifying volatility in transient dynamics. Through the implementation of stricter management measures, many historically depleted fish stocks began showing signs of recovery in recent decades. But these interventions coincided with accelerated changes in the oceans triggered by increasingly warmer, more variable climates. Applying multilevel models to annual estimates of demographic metrics of 38 stocks comprising 11 species across seven ecoregions in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, this study explores how time-varying local and regional climates contributed to the transient dynamics of recovering populations exposed to variable fishing pressures moderated by management actions. Analyses reveal that progressive reductions in fishing pressure and shifting climate conditions nonlinearly shaped rebuilding patterns of the stocks through restorations of maternal demographic structure (reversing age truncation) and reproductive capacity. As the survival rate and demographic structure of reproductive fish improved, transient growth became less sensitive to variability in recruitment and juvenile survival and more to that in adult survival. As the biomass of reproductive fish rose, recruitment success also became increasingly regulated by density-dependent processes involving higher numbers of older fish. When reductions in fishing pressure were insufficient or delayed, however, stocks became further depleted, with more eroded demographic structures. Although warmer local climates in spawning seasons promoted recruitment success in some ecoregions, changing climates in recent decades began adversely affecting reproductive performances overall, amplifying sensitivities to recruitment variability. These shared patterns underscore the value of demographic transients in developing robust strategies for managing marine resources. Such strategies could form the foundation for effective applications of adaptive measures resilient to future environmental change.",

    "abstract": "Metabarcoding approaches are powerful tools to unravel trophic relationships between predators and prey. To apply metabarcoding analyses on invertebrate gut contents, specimens must be well preserved from DNA degradation, thus the trapping method should be selected accordingly. Dry pitfall traps are commonly assumed to provide a better DNA preservation than traps that use a killing agent. However, this assumption has never been specifically tested for gut content analyses.\n\nIn our study, we compared how two types of pitfall trapping, dry vs. with brine, affect the conservation of prey DNA contained in the digestive tract of predators and subsequent metabarcoding analyses. We placed dry and \"classic\" pitfall traps in oilseed rape fields within an intensive agricultural area in the French Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. Traps were set up in autumn and compared for carabid trapping efficiency as well as our capacity to retrieve dietary information from the digestive tract of the main carabid species, Nebria salina and Calathus fuscipes.\n\nPCR success rate was higher in dry pitfall traps compared to classic ones for N. salina. We hypothesise that this was due to the presence of PCR inhibitors in the gut of this species. The ability to sequence prey DNA did not differ between specimens caught in both trap types. The list of predated species was similar between both trap types. However, sequencing yielded more prey OTUs from specimens caught in dry pitfall traps, leading to difference in prey community composition and a greater ability to reconstruct prey community\n\nOur analyses also shed light on the prey spectrum of Calathus fuscipes and Nebria salina in oilseed rape in autumn.",

Repeated measurements in forage breeding trials generate longitudinal datasets that must be properly analyzed giving a useful interpretation in the genotype selection process. In this study, we have presented a random regression (RRM) approach for selecting genotypes based on longitudinal DMY data generated from ten breeding trials and three perennial species, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), guineagrass (Megathyrsus maximus), and brachiaria (Urochloa spp.). We also proposed the estimation of adaptability based on the area under the curve and stability based on the curve coefficient of variation. Our results showed that RRM always approximated the (co)variance structure into an autoregressive pattern. Furthermore, RRM can offer useful information about longitudinal data in forage breeding trials, where the breeder can select genotypes based on their seasonality by interpreting reaction norms. Therefore, we recommend using RRM for longitudinal traits in breeding trials for perennial species.",

    "abstract": "The D. melanogaster protein coding gene bag of marbles (bam) plays a key role in early male and female reproduction by forming complexes with partner proteins to promote differentiation in gametogenesis. Like another germline gene, Sex lethal, bam genetically interacts with the endosymbiont Wolbachia, as Wolbachia rescues the reduced fertility of a bam hypomorphic mutant. Here, we explored the specificity of the bam-Wolbachia interaction by generating 22 new bam mutants, with ten mutants displaying fertility defects. Nine of these mutants trend towards rescue by the wMel Wolbachia variant, with eight statistically significant at the fertility and/or cytological level. In some cases, fertility was increased a striking 20-fold. There is no specificity between the rescue and the known binding regions of bam, suggesting wMel does not interact with one singular bam partner to rescue the reproductive phenotype. We further tested if wMel interacts with bam in a non-specific way, by increasing bam transcript levels or acting upstream in germline stem cells. A fertility assessment of a bam RNAi knockdown mutant reveals that wMel rescue is specific to functionally mutant bam alleles and we find no obvious evidence of wMel interaction with germline stem cells in bam mutants.\n\nAuthor SummaryReproduction in the Drosophila melanogaster fruit fly is dependent on the bag of marbles (bam) gene, which acts early in the process of generating eggs and sperm. Mutations to this gene negatively impact the fertility of the fly, causing it to be sterile or have fewer progeny. Interestingly, we find that the bacteria Wolbachia, which resides within reproductive cells across a wide range of insects, partially restores the fertility and ovary phenotype of several bam mutants of which the resultant Bam protein is altered from wildtype. The protein function of Bam is further suggested to be important by the lack of rescue for a fly that has a fertility defect due to low expression of a non-mutated bam gene. Previous work makes similar conclusions about Wolbachia with another reproductive gene, Sex lethal (Sxl), highlighting the potential for rescue of fertility mutants to occur in a similar way across different genes. An understanding of the ways in which Wolbachia can affect host reproduction provides us with context with which to frame Wolbachias impact on host genes, such as bam and Sxl, and consider the evolutionary implications of Wolbachias infection in D. melanogaster fruit flies.",

    "abstract": "Redox-active small molecules containing quinone functional groups play important roles as pharmaceuticals, but can be toxic if overdosed. Despite the need for a fast and quantitative method to detect quinone and its derivatives, current sensing strategies are often slow and struggle to differentiate between structural analogs. Leveraging the discovery that microorganisms use certain quinones to perform extracellular electron transfer (EET), we investigated the use of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum as a whole-cell bioelectronic sensor to selectively sense quinone analogs. By tailoring the native EET pathway in L. plantarum, we enabled quantitative quinone sensing of 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA) - a gut bifidogenic growth stimulator. We found that L. plantarum could respond to environmental DHNA within seconds, producing electronic signals that cover a 106 concentration range. This sensing capacity was robust in different assay media and allowed for continuous monitoring of DHNA concentrations. In a simulated gut environment containing a mixed pool of quinone derivatives, this tailored EET pathway can selectively sense pharmacologically relevant quinone analogs, such as DHNA and menadione, amongst other structurally similar quinone derivatives. We also developed a multivariate model to describe the mechanism behind this selectivity and found a predictable correlation between quinone physiochemical properties and the corresponding electronic signals. Our work presents a new strategy to selectively sense redox-active molecules using whole-cell bioelectronic sensors and opens the possibility of using probiotic L. plantarum for bioelectronic applications in human health.\n\nSignificant StatementQuinone-containing pharmaceuticals show toxicity at high concentrations, making it important to quickly and accurately measure their concentration while distinguishing between analogs. To address this problem, we leveraged recent discoveries in electroactive bacteria to develop a novel concept for whole-cell sensing. This concept combines selectivity and specificity, enabling differentiation between analogs based on the temporal dynamic of electron transfer in living cells. With this strategy, we achieved selective detection of pharmacologically relevant quinones with distinct electronic signals for each analog. These signals were deciphered by a multivariate model to provide insight into the specific physiochemical properties of each analog. We envision that this new concept can be applied to other analytes for faster and more efficient sensing using electroactive whole cells.",

To this end, we investigate the fine-tuning of a given pretrained protein language model for protein secondary structure prediction tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel end-to-end protein secondary structure prediction framework involving the lightweight fine-tuning of a pretrained model. The framework first introduces a few new parameters for each transformer block in the pretrained model, then updates only the newly introduced parameters, and then keeps the original pretrained parameters fixed during training. Extensive experiments on seven test sets, namely, CASP12, CASP13, CASP14, CB433, CB634, TEST2016, and TEST2018, show that the proposed framework outperforms existing predictors and achieves new state-of-the-art prediction performance. Furthermore, we also experimentally demonstrate that lightweight fine-tuning significantly outperforms full model fine-tuning and feature extraction in enabling models to predict secondary structures. Further analysis indicates that only a few top transformer blocks need to introduce new parameters, while skipping many lower transformer blocks has little impact on the prediction accuracy of secondary structures.",

    "abstract": "Sparse scan partial thermal ablation (TA) with focused ultrasound (FUS) may be deployed to treat solid tumors and increase delivery of systemically administered therapeutics. Further, C6-ceramide-loaded nanoliposomes (CNLs), which rely upon the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect for delivery, have shown promise for treating solid tumors and are being tested in clinical trials. Here, our objective was to determine whether CNLs synergize with TA in the control of 4T1 breast tumors. CNL-monotherapy of 4T1 tumors yielded significant intratumoral bioactive C6 accumulation by the EPR effect, but tumor growth was not controlled. TA increased bioactive C6 accumulation by [~]12.5-fold over the EPR effect. In addition, TA+CNL caused shifts in long-chain to very-long-chain ceramide ratios (i.e., C16/24 and C18/C24) that could potentially contribute to tumor control. Nonetheless, these changes in intratumoral ceramide levels were still insufficient to confer tumor growth control beyond that achieved when combining with TA with control \"ghost\" nanoliposomes (GNL). While this lack of synergy could be due to increased \"pro-tumor\" sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels, this is unlikely because S1P levels exhibited only a moderate and statistically insignificant increase with TA+CNL. In vitro studies showed that 4T1 cells are highly resistant to C6, offering the most likely explanation for the inability of TA to synergize with CNL. Thus, while our results show that sparse scan TA is a powerful approach for markedly enhancing CNL delivery and generating \"anti-tumor\" shifts in long-chain to very-long-chain ceramide ratios, resistance of the tumor to C6 can still be a rate-limiting factor for some solid tumor types.",

    "abstract": "Tandem repeats (TRs) are polymorphic sequences of DNA that are composed of repeating units of motifs, whose lengths can vary depending on the type of TR. Expansions of TRs are responsible for approximately 50 monogenic diseases, compared to over 4,300 disease causing genes disrupted by single nucleotide variants and small indels. It appears thus reasonable to expect the discovery of additional pathogenic repeat expansions, which has the potential of significantly narrowing the current diagnostic gap in many diseases. Recently, short and long-read whole genome sequencing with the use of advanced bioinformatics tools, have identified a growing number of TR expansions in the human population. The majority of these loci are expanded in <1% of genomes. Categorizing and prioritizing such TR loci is a growing challenge to human genomic studies. We present a first-in-class machine learning tool, RExPRT (Repeat EXpansion Pathogenicity pRediction Tool), which is designed to distinguish pathogenic from benign TR expansions. Leave-one-out cross validation results demonstrated that an ensemble approach comprised of support vector machines (SVM) and extreme gradient boosted decision tree (XGB) classify TRs with a precision of 92% and a recall of 90%. Further validation of RExPRT on unseen test data demonstrate a similar precision of 86%, and a recall of 60%. RExPRTs high precision in particular, will be of significant value to large-scale discovery studies, which require the prioritization of promising candidate loci for time-consuming and costly functional follow-up studies. Application of RExPRT to ~800,000 TRs in the reference genome identified ~30,000 TRs that would be likely pathogenic upon expansion. Thus, RExPRT establishes a foundation for the application of machine learning approaches to categorize the pathogenicity of tandem repeat loci.",

    "abstract": "Proteins bind to metals such as copper, zinc, magnesium, etc., serving various purposes such as importing, exporting, or transporting metal in other parts of the cell as ligands and maintaining stable protein structure to function properly. A metal binding site indicates the single amino acid position where a protein binds a metal ion. Manually identifying metal binding sites is expensive, laborious, and time-consuming. A tiny fraction of the millions of proteins in UniProtKB - the most comprehensive protein database - are annotated with metal binding sites, leaving many millions of proteins waiting for metal binding site annotation. Developing a computational pipeline is thus essential to keep pace with the growing number of proteins. A significant shortcoming of the existing computational methods is the consideration of the long-term dependency of the residues. Other weaknesses include low accuracy, absence of positional information, hand-engineered features, and a pre-determined set of residues and metal ions. In this paper, we propose MetaLLM, a metal binding site prediction technique, by leveraging the recent progress in self-supervised attention-based (e.g. Transformer) large language models (LLMs) and a considerable amount of protein sequences publicly available. LLMs are capable of modelling long residual dependency in a sequence. The proposed MetaLLM uses a transformer pre-trained on an extensive database of protein sequences and later fine-tuned on metal-binding proteins for multi-label metal ions prediction. A 10-fold cross-validation shows more than 90% precision for the most prevalent metal ions.",

    "abstract": "Living systems adopt a diversity of curved and highly dynamic shapes. These diverse morphologies appear on many length-scales, from cells to tissues and organismal scales. The common driving force for these dynamic shape changes are contractile stresses generated by myosin motors in the cell cytoskeleton, an intrinsically active filamentous material, while converting chemical energy into mechanical work. A good understanding of how contractile stresses in the cytoskeleton arise into different 3D shapes and what are the selection rules that determine their final configurations still lacks. Aiming to identify the selection rules governing the shapes formed by contractile forces in living systems, we recreate the actomyosin cytoskeleton in-vitro, with precisely controlled composition and initial geometry. A set of actomyosin gel discs, intrinsically identical but of variable initial geometry, spontaneously self-organize into a family of 3D shapes. This process occurs through robust distinct dynamical pathways, without specific pre-programming and additional regulation. Shape selection is encoded in the initial disc radius to thickness aspect ratio, and thus scale-free. This may indicate a universal process of shape selection, that works across scales, from cells to tissues and organelles. Finally, our results suggest that, while the dynamical pathways may depend on the detailed interactions of the different microscopic components within the gel, the final selected shapes obey the general theory of elastic deformations of thin sheets. Altogether, these results provide novel insights on the mechanically induced spontaneous shape transitions in active contractile matter and uncover new mechanisms that drive shape selections in living systems across scales.\n\nSignificance statementLiving systems adopt a diversity of curved and highly dynamic shapes.

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial genome encodes essential machinery for respiration and metabolic homeostasis but is paradoxically among the most common targets of somatic mutation in the cancer genome, with truncating mutations in respiratory complex I genes being most over-represented1. While mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations have been associated with both improved and worsened prognoses in several tumour lineages1-,3, whether these mutations are drivers or exert any functional effect on tumour biology remains controversial. Here we discovered that complex I-encoding mtDNA mutations are sufficient to remodel the tumour immune landscape and therapeutic resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. Using mtDNA base editing technology4 we engineered recurrent truncating mutations in the mtDNA-encoded complex I gene, Mt-Nd5, into murine models of melanoma. Mechanistically, these mutations promoted utilisation of pyruvate as a terminal electron acceptor and increased glycolytic flux without major effects on oxygen consumption, driven by an over-reduced NAD pool and NADH shuttling between GAPDH and MDH1, mediating a Warburg-like metabolic shift. In turn, without modifying tumour growth, this altered cancer cell-intrinsic metabolism reshaped the tumour microenvironment in both mice and humans, promoting an anti- tumour immune response characterised by loss of resident neutrophils. This subsequently sensitised tumours bearing high mtDNA mutant heteroplasmy to immune checkpoint blockade, with phenocopy of key metabolic changes being sufficient to mediate this effect. Strikingly, patient lesions bearing >50% mtDNA mutation heteroplasmy also demonstrated a >2.5-fold improved response rate to checkpoint inhibitor blockade. Taken together these data nominate mtDNA mutations as functional regulators of cancer metabolism and tumour biology, with potential for therapeutic exploitation and treatment stratification.",

Despite reports linking aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) with increased metastatic incidence, in vivo evidence establishing driver roles for lncRNAs in metastatic progression is lacking. Here, we report that overexpression of the metastasis-associated lncRNA Malat1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) in the autochthonous K-ras/p53 mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is sufficient to drive cancer progression and metastatic dissemination. We show that increased expression of endogenous Malat1 RNA cooperates with p53 loss to promote widespread LUAD progression to a poorly differentiated, invasive, and metastatic disease. Mechanistically, we observe that Malat1 overexpression leads to the inappropriate transcription and paracrine secretion of the inflammatory cytokine, Ccl2, to augment the mobility of tumor and stromal cells in vitro and to trigger inflammatory responses in the tumor microenvironment in vivo. Notably, Ccl2 blockade fully reverses cellular and organismal phenotypes of Malat1 overexpression. We propose that Malat1 overexpression in advanced tumors activates Ccl2 signaling to reprogram the tumor microenvironment to an inflammatory and pro-metastatic state.",

    "abstract": "Pro-peptide precursors are processed into biologically active peptide hormones or neurotransmitters, each playing an essential role in physiology and disease. Genetic loss of function of a pro-peptide precursor results in the simultaneous ablation of all biologically-active peptides within that precursor, often leading to a composite phenotype that can be difficult to align with the loss of specific peptide components. Due to this biological constraint and technical limitations, mice carrying the selective ablation of individual peptides encoded by pro-peptide precursor genes, while leaving the other peptides unaffected, have remained largely unaddressed. Here, we developed and characterized a mouse model carrying the selective knockout of the TLQP-21 neuropeptide ({Delta}TLQP-21) encoded by the Vgf gene. To achieve this goal, we used a knowledge-based approach by mutating a codon in the Vgf sequence leading to the substitution of the C-terminal Arginine of TLQP-21, which is the pharmacophore as well as an essential cleavage site from its precursor, into Alanine (R21[-&gt;]A). We provide several independent validations of this mouse, including a novel in-gel digestion targeted mass spectrometry identification of the unnatural mutant sequence, exclusive to the mutant mouse. {Delta}TLQP-21 mice do not manifest gross behavioral and metabolic abnormalities and reproduce well, yet they have a unique metabolic phenotype characterized by a temperature-dependent resistance to diet-induced obesity and activation of the brown adipose tissue.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic climate change threatens the persistence of coral reefs by impacting reproduction and accelerating coral loss. Adult corals depend on nutritional exchange with their endosymbiotic algae (Symbiodiniaceae) to fulfill their energetic demands. However, the mechanisms underlying the onset of this exchange during early life stages and how it contributes to developmental energy demands are unclear. We conducted an integrative analysis of metabolism across developmental stages in Montipora capitata, a vertically transmitting coral (Symbiodiniaceae are passed from parent to offspring) in Hawai{square}i. We applied physiological (metabolism and symbiont density) and multi-omic (metabolomics, transcriptomics, and microbial amplicon sequencing) approaches over 13 time points between 1-255 hours post-fertilization from eggs to settled recruits. Energetic demand (respiration) increased as embryos developed into larvae and progressed through metamorphosis. Symbiont photosynthetic capacity (photosynthesis and cell density) increased across ontogeny, demonstrating potential for symbiont-derived nutrition to fuel coral development and growth. Indeed, gene expression and metabolomic analyses revealed that symbiont-derived nutrition is metabolized starting in the motile larval stage with increasing utilization during metamorphosis and following settlement. Specifically, gene and metabolic pathways associated with organic compound transport and glucose and fatty acid metabolism were enriched and there was expanded use of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in metamorphosed polyps and recruits. Larvae also demonstrate increased cellular processes to maintain nutrient balance between host and symbiont and regulate symbiont populations through expression of genes that regulate nitrogen assimilation and response to reactive oxygen species. Collectively, our multi-omic characterization reveals that symbiont-derived nutrition becomes increasingly important to buffer energetic demands required for coral settlement. In environmentally stressful conditions, early life stages of vertically transmitting species may be increasingly vulnerable to the loss of symbiont-derived nutrition. Therefore, early interventions to reduce symbiotic stress during sensitive developmental stages could enhance coral reef recruitment and recovery as climate change intensifies.",

    "abstract": "During early pregnancy in humans and rodents, uterine stromal cells undergo a remarkable differentiation to form the decidua, a transient maternal tissue that supports the growing fetus. It is important to understand the key decidual pathways that orchestrate the proper development of the placenta, a key structure at the maternal-fetal interface. We discovered that ablation of expression of the transcription factor Runx1 in decidual stromal cells in a conditional Runx1-null mouse model (Runx1d/d) causes fetal lethality during placentation. Further phenotypic analysis revealed that uteri of pregnant Runx1d/d mice exhibited severely compromised decidual angiogenesis, and a lack of trophoblast differentiation and migration, resulting in impaired spiral artery remodeling. Gene expression profiling using uteri from Runx1d/d and control mice revealed that Runx1 directly controls the decidual expression of the gap junction protein connexin 43 (also known as GJA1), which was previously shown to be essential for decidual angiogenesis. Our study also revealed a critical role of Runx1 in controlling insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling at the maternal-fetal interface. While Runx1-deficiency drastically reduced the production of IGF2 by the decidual cells, we observed concurrent elevated expression of the IGF-binding protein 4 (IGFBP4), which regulates the bioavailability of IGFs thereby controlling trophoblast differentiation. We posit that dysregulated expression of GJA1, IGF2, and IGFBP4 in Runx1d/d decidua contributes to the observed defects in uterine angiogenesis, trophoblast differentiation, and vascular remodeling. This study therefore provides unique insights into key maternal pathways that control the early phases of maternal-fetal interactions within a critical window during placental development.\n\nSignificanceA clear understanding of the maternal pathways that ensure coordination of uterine differentiation and angiogenesis with embryonic growth during the critical early stages of placenta formation still eludes us. The present study reveals that the transcription factor Runx1 controls a set of molecular, cellular, and integrative mechanisms that mediate maternal adaptive responses controlling uterine angiogenesis, trophoblast differentiation, and resultant uterine vascular remodeling, which are essential steps during placenta development.",

    "abstract": "Making meaningful inferences about the functional architecture of the language system requires the ability to refer to the same neural units across individuals and studies. Traditional brain imaging approaches align and average brains together in a common space. However, lateral frontal and temporal cortex, where the language system resides, is characterized by high structural and functional inter-individual variability. This variability reduces the sensitivity and functional resolution of group-averaging analyses. This problem is compounded by the fact that language areas often lay in close proximity to regions of other large-scale networks with different functional profiles. A solution inspired by other fields of cognitive neuroscience (e.g., vision) is to identify language areas functionally in each individual brain using a  localizer task (e.g., a language comprehension task). This approach has proven productive in fMRI, yielding a number of discoveries about the language system, and has been successfully extended to intracranial recording investigations. Here, we apply this approach to MEG. Across two experiments (one in Dutch speakers, n=19; one in English speakers, n=23), we examined neural responses to the processing of sentences and a control condition (nonword sequences). We demonstrated that the neural response to language is spatially consistent at the individual level. The language-responsive sensors of interest were, as expected, less responsive to the nonwords condition. Clear inter-individual differences were present in the topography of the neural response to language, leading to greater sensitivity when the data were analyzed at the individual level compared to the group level. Thus, as in fMRI, functional localization yields benefits in MEG and thus opens the door to probing fine-grained distinctions in space and time in future MEG investigations of language processing.",

    "abstract": "Extant work reliably demonstrates that autistic individuals move with increased jerk (where jerk concerns change in acceleration). Although it follows that autistic movement may therefore diverge from fundamental power laws that govern movement, this hypothesis has not been directly tested to date. This lack of insight holds back progress in understanding the mechanisms underpinning differences in autism in motor control particularly with respect to movement jerkiness. Here we investigated whether movements executed by autistic adults diverged from the typical power law relationship that links movement speed and curvature. x and y position of the stylus tip was recorded at 133 Hz while 21 autistic and 19 non-autistic age-, intelligence quotient- and sex-matched adults traced, on a tablet device, a range of shapes that varied in angular frequency from 2/33 (spiral-like shapes) to 4 (square-like shapes). The gradient of the relationship between speed and curvature for each angular frequency-defined shape is reliably predicted by a set of mathematical equations often referred to as fundamental power laws thus, to assess deviations from power laws, we compared autistic and non-autistic participants in terms of speed-curvature gradients. To gain insight into potential mechanisms underpinning any differences we also used fast Fourier transform to explore amplitude spectral density across all angular frequencies. Compared to non-autistic adults, autistic adults exhibited significantly steeper speed-curvature gradients. Fast Fourier transform further revealed that non-autistic participants exhibited highly precise modulation of speed oscillations around the target frequency. For example, when drawing an ellipse their speed profile was dominated by speed changes in a band centred around the angular frequency 2 with minimal changes in other bands. Autistic adults, in contrast, exhibited less precise modulation of speed oscillations around the target frequency, a result that is reminiscent of a literature reporting broader auditory filters in autistic individuals. These results evidence, in autistic adults, a deviation from the power laws that typically govern movement and suggest differences in motor cortical control policies and/or biomechanical constraints.",

    "abstract": "The parabrachial nuclear complex (PBN) is a nexus for aversion, and for the sensory and affective components of pain perception. We have previously shown that, during chronic pain, PBN neurons in anesthetized rodents have amplified activity. We report a method to record from PBN neurons of behaving, head-restrained mice, while applying reproducible noxious stimuli. We find that both spontaneous and evoked activity are higher in awake animals, compared to urethane anesthetized mice. Fiber photometry of calcium responses from CGRP-expressing PBN neurons demonstrates that these neurons respond to nociceptive stimuli. In both males and females with neuropathic or inflammatory pain, responses of PBN neurons remain amplified for at least 5 weeks, in parallel with increased pain metrics. We also show that PBN neurons can be rapidly conditioned to respond to innocuous stimuli, after pairing with nociceptive stimuli. Finally, we demonstrate that changes in PBN neuronal activity are correlated with changes in arousal, measured as changes in pupil diameter.\n\nSignificance StatementThe parabrachial complex is a nexus of aversion, including pain. We report a method to record from parabrachial nucleus neurons of behaving mice, while applying reproducible noxious stimuli. This allowed, for the first time, tracking the activity of these neurons over time in animals with neuropathic or inflammatory pain. It also allowed us to show that the activity of these neurons correlates with arousal states, and that these neurons can be conditioned to respond to innocuous stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Vinculin is a component of focal adhesions strengthening integrin receptors association to the actin cytoskeleton during mechanotransduction. While vinculin activation leading to its association with actin filaments has been particularly studied, the role and mechanism of vinculin oligomerization remain unclear. The Shigella IpaA effector binds to vinculin to promote efficient bacterial invasion of host cells. Unlike canonical activating ligand, IpaA interacts with the vinculin subdomains D1 and D2 via its three Vinculin Binding Sites (VBSs), promoting major allosteric changes leading to D1D2 domain-mediated trimerization. Here, we built on structural models of allosteric conformers of D1D2:IpaA complexes to design mutations and analyzed their effects on IpaA-induced trimer formation using native gel shift assays. We show that charge inversions, mutations affecting polar interactions at residues in D1D2 interfacing IpaA VBS3 and targeting a distal putative coiled-coil motif in D2 reduced the rates of D1D2 trimer formation. Introduction of these mutations in full-length vinculin led to a decrease in the number and size of focal adhesions, with distinct elongated focal adhesions associated with the coiled-coil mutation. These findings suggest that IpaA hijacks a cell endogenous head-domain mediated vinculin oligomerization process involved in the maturation of focal adhesion.",

The research fields that make use of this application of nanodiamonds include stem cell biology and cancer biology, where quiescent and differentiating cells can be traced in vitro and in vivo. However, these studies focus on using nanodiamonds as simple labels, whereas they can serve as highly sensitive intracellular sensors for free radical species. In this study, we aimed to bring the two approaches together and to assess the free radical production in the cells over the course of their differentiation.\n\nWe report on the successful enterocytic differentiation of HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells, pre-loaded with fluorescent nanodiamonds. The cells were cultured in butyrate-free or butyrate-supplemented medium for 13 days. Butyrate-treated cells developed the morphological and molecular traits, characteristic for normal enterocytes. Fluorescent nanodiamonds did not have a negative effect on the process of differentiation. Moreover, the particles could be found in the cytoplasm of both undifferentiated and re-differentiated cells even after 13 days of culture. The internalized nanodiamonds were used to assess the free radical load in the undifferentiated and re-differentiated HT-29 cells at different stages of the experiment.

    "abstract": "The energy-burning capability of beige adipose tissue is a potential therapeutic tool for reducing obesity and metabolic disease, but this capacity is decreased by aging. Here, we evaluate the impact of aging on the profile and activity of adipocyte stem and progenitor cells (ASPCs) and adipocytes during the beiging process. We found that aging increases the expression of Cd9 and other fibrogenic genes in fibroblastic ASPCs and blocks their differentiation into beige adipocytes. Fibroblastic ASPC populations from young and aged mice were equally competent for beige differentiation in vitro, suggesting that environmental factors suppress adipogenesis in vivo. Examination of adipocytes by single nucleus RNA-sequencing identified compositional and transcriptional differences in adipocyte populations with age and cold exposure. Notably, cold exposure induced an adipocyte population expressing high levels of de novo lipogenesis (DNL) genes, and this response was severely blunted in aged animals. We further identified natriuretic peptide clearance receptor Npr3, a beige fat repressor, as a marker gene for a subset of white adipocytes and an aging-upregulated gene in adipocytes. In summary, this study indicates that aging blocks beige adipogenesis and dysregulates adipocyte responses to cold exposure and provides a unique resource for identifying cold and/or aging-regulated pathways in adipose tissue.",

    "abstract": "Temperature affects growth, metabolism, and interspecific interactions in microbial communities. Within animal hosts, gut bacterial symbionts can provide resistance to parasitic infections. Infection can also be shaped by host body temperature. However, the effects of temperature on the antiparasitic activities of gut symbionts have seldom been explored. The Lactobacillus-rich gut microbiota of facultatively endothermic honey bees is subject to seasonal and ontogenetic changes in host temperature that could alter the effects of symbionts against parasites. We used cell cultures of a Lactobacillus symbiont and an important trypanosomatid gut parasite of honey bees to test the potential for temperature to shape parasite-symbiont interactions.\n\nWe found that symbionts showed greater heat tolerance than parasites and chemically inhibited parasite growth via production of acids. Acceleration of symbiont growth and acid production at high temperatures resulted in progressively stronger antiparasitic effects across a temperature range typical of bee colonies. Consequently, the presence of symbionts reduced both peak growth rate and heat tolerance of parasites. Results suggest that the endothermic behavior of honey bees could potentiate the effectiveness of gut symbionts that limit parasites ability to withstand high temperature, implicating thermoregulation as a reinforcer of core symbioses and possibly microbiome-mediated antiparasitic defense.\n\nIMPORTANCETwo factors that shape the resistance of animals to infection are body temperature and gut microbiota. However, temperature can also alter interactions among microbes, raising the question of whether and how temperature changes the antiparasitic effects of gut microbiota. Honey bees are agriculturally important hosts of diverse parasites and infection-mitigating gut microbes. They can also socially regulate their body temperatures to an extent unusual for an insect. We show that high temperatures found in honey bee colonies augment the ability of a gut bacterial symbiont to inhibit growth of a common bee parasite and reduce the parasites ability to grow at high temperatures. This suggests that fluctuations in colony and body temperatures across life stages and seasons could alter the protective value of bees gut microbiota against parasites, and that temperature-driven changes in gut microbiota could be an underappreciated mechanism by which temperature-- including endothermy and fever-- alters animal infection.",

We evaluated the effectiveness of the In2Care(R) station, which suppresses mosquito populations via the entomopathogenic fungus, Beauveria bassiana, and the insect growth regulator pyriproxyfen, the latter of which is autodisseminated among larval habitats by contaminated mosquitoes. A field trial was conducted using 110 In2Care(R) stations in a 50,000 m2 area and results were compared to four control areas that did not receive the treatment. Efficacy was evaluated by comparing egg counts and measuring larvicidal impact in surrounding breeding sites. Laboratory experiments validated the effect of B. bassiana on adult survival. Results of this field trial indicate that, six weeks after the In2Care(R) stations were deployed, treatment site ovitraps contained 43% fewer eggs than control site ovitraps, and 33% fewer eggs after ten weeks, suggesting that the In2Care(R) station was able to reduce the egg density of Ae. notoscriptus. Population reduction remained evident for up to three weeks after In2Care(R) stations were removed. Treatment site ovitraps had significantly fewer Ae. notoscriptus eclosing than control site ovitraps, confirming the pyriproxyfen autodissemination feature of the stations. An average reduction of 50% in adult eclosion was achieved. Exposure to B. bassiana resulted in four-times higher mortality among adult mosquitoes. Additionally, using fresh In2Care(R) nettings led to an 88% decrease in average survival compared to four-week-old nettings. The use of In2Care(R) stations has potential for suppressing Ae. notoscriptus egg density.",

    "abstract": "There have been almost no studies with an evolutionary perspective on eye (iris) color, outside of humans and domesticated animals. Extant members of the family Felidae have a great interspecific and intraspecific diversity of eye colors, in stark contrast to their closest relatives, all of which have only brown eyes. This makes the felids a great model to investigate the evolution of eye color in natural populations. Through machine learning cluster image analysis of publicly available photographs of all felid species, as well as a number of subspecies, five felid eye colors were identified: brown, hazel/green, yellow/beige, gray, and blue. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, the presence or absence of these colors was reconstructed on a phylogeny. Additionally, through a new color analysis method, the specific shades of the ancestors eyes were reconstructed to a high degree of precision. The ancestral felid population was found to have brown eyed individuals, as well as a novel evolution of gray eyed individuals, the latter being a key innovation that allowed the rapid diversification of eye color seen in modern felids, including numerous gains and losses of different eye colors. It was also found that the loss of brown eyes and the gain of yellow/beige eyes is associated with an increase in the likelihood of evolving round pupils, which in turn influence the shades present in the eyes. Along with these important insights, the unique methods presented in this work are widely applicable and will facilitate future research into phylogenetic reconstruction of color beyond irises.",

    "abstract": "All forms of social interactions are strongly affected by population mixing and modes of transmission. However, largely because of the unavailability of an easily tractable model system, the effect of repeated community mixing on the evolutionary dynamics of microbial predator-prey interactions remains largely unexplored1. Hence, in a laboratory evolution experiment, we propagated bacterial predator-prey communities in two distinct transfer regimens. In the first regimen predator-prey communities were repeatedly mixed (horizontal transfer), and in the second treatment communities were not mixed (vertical transfer). To do so, we used Myxococcus xanthus as a generalist bacterial predator and Escherichia coli as a prey bacterium. We show that prey populations from vertical regimen were less resistant to predation than the ones from horizontal regimen. This was because prey from the horizontal regimen were under directional selection resulting in lesser within-population divergence, and an increasing resistance to predation over the evolutionary timescale. In the vertical regime, prey isolates with higher and lower degrees of resistance relative to ancestors evolved in all replicate populations, suggestive of fluctuating selection dynamics. Further, contrary to our expectations, predatory efficiency of evolved M. xanthus isolates was either the same or lesser than the ancestor. This is likely because of social evolution of scavenging phenotypes that rely on exploiting the social mechanisms of predation such as the secretion of diffusible substances (for example antibiotics, toxins, and digestive enzymes) for extracellular digestion of prey 2-4. Together, we demonstrate that community mixing affects the evolution of prey bacteria but has little effect on the hunting ability of the social predator M. xanthus.",

    "abstract": "Most multicellular organisms reproduce sexually despite the costs associated with sexuality1. This has been explained as the result of selection favouring the ability to recombine the genome. The lack of recombination in asexual species constrains their adaptability and leads to the accumulation of deleterious mutations, ultimately increasing their risk of extinction2. Nonetheless, successful asexual life histories persist among multicellular organisms, and explanatory mechanisms which may help limit the cost of asexuality remain enigmatic3-6. In search of these mechanisms, we looked at the molecular evolutionary changes in sexual and obligate asexual strains of the planarian flatworm, Schmidtea mediterranea. We find that the accumulation of deleterious mutations is largely avoided in the asexual strain. We find evidence that this is achieved by somatic gene conversion in stem cells allowing for the restoration of fit alleles and the purification of deleterious mutations. Our analyses provide a potential mechanism for the maintenance of asexuality in a metazoan. Taken together, these findings suggest that gene conversion may be used by asexual lineages to unlink loci, counteracting some of the key challenges facing obligate asexual species.\n\nSignificance statementSexual reproduction is the most common reproductive strategy for multicellular organisms, while obligate asexuality is very rare. This rarity of asexuality is driven by a reduced ability to adapt to new challenges and an accumulation of deleterious mutations associated with the lack of sexual recombination.\n\nHere we find that obligate asexual planarians are able to avoid the accumulation of deleterious mutations associated with asexuality by exploiting a form of recombination within the stem cells of the worm to remove deleterious mutations.\n\nThis study reinvigorates the long-standing debate on how some asexual lineages persist, by asking this question in obligate fissiparous animals and showing that asexual recombination in somatic cells followed by selection can help limit the cost of asexuality.",

    "abstract": "Despite the potential for mechanical, developmental and/or chemical mechanisms to prevent self-fertilization, incidental self-fertilization is inevitable in many predominantly outcrossing species. In such cases, inbreeding (by self-fertilization or biparental inbreeding) may severely compromise individual fitness by exposing the recessive genetic load, which is otherwise hidden in the heterozygous state. Unquestionably, much of this load is an inevitable consequence of the mutational process and the masking of deleterious recessive alleles in predominantly outcrossing populations. However, we show that when reproductive compensation allows for the replacements of inviable embryos lost early in development, natural selection can favor highly deleterious recessive variants that functionally induce self-sacrificial death of inbred embryos. Our work provides numerous testable hypotheses, and suggests that the distinction between late self-incompatibility and early acting inbreeding depression may be somewhat artificial in some taxa.",

    "abstract": "It is estimated that animals pollinate 87.5% of flowering plants worldwide and that managed honey bees (Apis mellifera) account for 30-50% of this ecosystem service to agriculture. In addition to their important role as pollinators, honey bees are well-established insect models for studying learning and memory, behaviour, caste differentiation, epigenetic mechanisms, olfactory biology, sex determination and eusociality. Despite their importance to agriculture, knowledge of honey bee biology lags behind many other livestock species. In this study we have used scRNA-Seq to map cell types to different developmental stages of the worker honey bee (prepupa at day 11 and pupa at day 15), and sought to determine their gene signatures and thereby provide potential functional annotations for as yet poorly characterized genes. To identify cell type populations we examined the cell-to-cell network based on the similarity of the single-cells transcriptomic profiles. Grouping similar cells together we identified 63 different cell clusters of which 15 clusters were identifiable at both stages. To determine genes associated with specific cell populations or with a particular biological process involved in honey bee development, we used gene co-expression analysis. We combined this analysis with literature mining, the honey bee protein atlas and Gene Ontology analysis to determine cell cluster identity. Of the cell clusters identified, 9 were related to the nervous system, 7 to the fat body, 14 to the cuticle, 5 to muscle, 4 to compound eye, 2 to midgut, 2 to hemocytes and 1 to malpighian tubule/pericardial nephrocyte. To our knowledge, this is the first whole single cell atlas of honey bees at any stage of development and demonstrates the potential for further work to investigate their biology of at the cellular level.",

Here, we demonstrate the rapid and specific formation of collagen gels with high transparency and high elastic modulus by transition metal complexation within minutes. Transition metal ions such as K2PtCl4 exhibited rapid gelation due to the formation of a cross-linked network of the collagen triple-helix by Pt- O and/or Pt-N bonds. Interestingly, type I to IV collagens showed rapid gelation, while other extracellular matrices and DNA did not exhibit this phenomenon, suggesting the importance of intermolecular interaction in a rigid triple-helix structure. Live imaging of colon cancer organoids in three-dimensional culture indicated a collective migration property with modulating high elastic modulus, suggesting activation for metastasis progress. This technology that facilitates deep-live observation and mechanical stiffness adjustment will be useful as a new class of scaffolds.\n\nTeaserTransparent collagen gels with tunable mechanical properties allow deep-live observation of cells cultured in a tough environment like our bodies.",

To model the lymph node paracortex, we utilized multi-channel microfluidic devices to engineer a 3D lymph node stromal network from human cultured FRCs embedded in a collagen I-fibrin hydrogel. In the hydrogel, the FRCs self-assembled into an interconnected network, secreted the extracellular matrix proteins entactin, collagen IV, and fibronectin, as well as expressed an array of immune cell trafficking chemokines. Although the engineered FRC network did not secrete characteristic CCR7-ligand chemokines (i.e. CCL19 and CCL21), human primary TNF- matured monocyte-derived dendritic cells, CD45RA+ T-cells, and CD45RA- T-cells migrated toward the lymph node stromal network to a greater extent than toward a blank hydrogel. Furthermore, the FRCs co-recruited dendritic cells and antigen-specific T-cells into the lymph node stromal network. This engineered lymph node stromal network may help evaluate how human dendritic cells and T-cells migrate into the lymph node paracortex via CCR7-independent mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "P-TEFb and CDK12 facilitate transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II. Given the prominence of both kinases in cancer, gaining a better understanding of their interplay could inform the design of novel anti-cancer strategies. While down-regulation of DNA repair genes in CDK12-targeted cancer cells is being explored therapeutically, little is known about mechanisms and significance of transcriptional induction upon inhibition of CDK12. We show that selective targeting of CDK12 in colon cancer-derived cells activates P-TEFb via its release from the inhibitory 7SK snRNP. In turn, P-TEFb stimulates Pol II pause release at thousands of genes, most of which become newly dependent on P-TEFb. Amongst the induced genes are those stimulated by hallmark pathways in cancer, including p53 and NF-{kappa}B. Consequently, CDK12-inhibited cancer cells exhibit hypersensitivity to inhibitors of P-TEFb. While blocking P-TEFb triggers their apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner, it impedes cell proliferation irrespective of p53 by preventing induction of genes downstream of the DNA damage-induced NF-{kappa}B signaling. In summary, stimulation of Pol II pause release at the signal-responsive genes underlies the functional dependence of CDK12-inhibited cancer cells on P-TEFb. Our study establishes the mechanistic underpinning for combinatorial targeting of CDK12 with either P-TEFb or the induced oncogenic pathways in cancer.",

    "abstract": "In response to changing blood pressure, arteries adjust their caliber to control perfusion. This vital autoregulatory property, termed vascular myogenic tone, stabilizes downstream capillary pressure. We discovered that tissue temperature critically determines myogenic tone. Heating steeply activates tone in skeletal muscle, gut, brain and skin arteries with temperature coefficients (Q10) of [~]11-20. Further, arterial thermosensitivity is tuned to resting tissue temperatures, making myogenic tone sensitive to small thermal fluctuations. Interestingly, temperature and intraluminal pressure are sensed largely independently and integrated to trigger myogenic tone. We show that TRPV1 and TRPM4 mediate heat-induced tone in skeletal muscle arteries. Variations in tissue temperature are known to alter vascular conductance; remarkably, thermosensitive tone counterbalances this effect, thus protecting capillary integrity and fluid balance. In conclusion, thermosensitive myogenic tone is a fundamental homeostatic mechanism regulating tissue perfusion.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryArterial blood pressure and temperature are integrated via thermosensitve ion channels to produce myogenic tone.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite similar levels of coronary occlusion and standard of care management, the occurrence of scarring over adaptive heart repair following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains unpredictable. Recent studies indicate that mechanical cues may modulate the transcriptional programs involved in tissue repair, possibly explaining why ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony an independent predictor of post-infarction outcome.\n\nObjectiveOur study aimed to investigate the relationship between mechanical cues and the outcome of post-myocardial infarction heart remodeling by live imaging. Specifically, we examined the impact of individual variability of myocardial dyssynchrony, characterized by a divergent direction of injured left ventricle wall movement next to live tissue, on the formation of a large scar, dilation of the left ventricle, and loss of pumping function.\n\nMethodsWe assessed the location and degree of regional systolic and diastolic dyssynchrony using transthoracic echocardiography coupled with speckle tracking imaging. Specifically, we measured the difference in absolute strain values between adjacent regions of the left ventricle at 5 days following the induction of a standard experimental infarction in female C57Bl6 mice. Three weeks later, transthoracic echocardiography was repeated to analyze the mass and global function of the left ventricle right before termination. We then examined the size of the scar in matched mid-sections of the left ventricle circumferential segments from each mouse using histomorphometry. Finally, we evaluated the potential impact on transcriptional tissue repair programs using spatial transcriptomic analysis on representative hearts with either adaptive or fibrotic post-infarction heart remodeling.\n\nResultsWe analyzed all 96 systolic and diastolic strain-related parameters in the same 48 regions of the left ventricle in all mice, with echocardiographic and histological sections following the same orientation. Stepwise analysis of the live imaging data revealed that a combination of 8 regional strain parameters could predict fibrotic remodeling (Area under the ROC curve= 0.8290). We observed that scarring remodeling was associated with opposing trends of systolic and diastolic circumferential strain % delta values on adjacent regions at day 5, while adaptive remodeling at day 28 occurred when the trend followed the direction of control (sham) hearts. Cluster analysis of gene transcripts and speckle tracking assessment on representative hearts with adaptive or fibrotic post-infarction remodeling indicated a correlation between regional post-infarction dyssynchrony and the transcriptional program. Adrenergic receptors, including Adra1, Trpc3, and Myh7, were found to be linked to specific regional dyssynchrony values and scarring remodeling.\n\nConclusionOur study demonstrates the potential of regional strain parameters obtained through live imaging in predicting fibrotic remodeling following myocardial infarction. Furthermore, our findings suggest a link between regional post-infarction dyssynchrony and the transcriptional program. These results highlight the potential applicability of our approach in clinical settings and provide insights for future personalization of therapeutic strategies.",

Although our understanding of how astrocytes regulate brain circuits has recently flourish, whether and how striatal astrocytes contribute in regulating food-related behaviors and whole-body metabolism is still unknown. In this study, we show that exposure to enriched food leads to profound changes in neuronal activity and synchrony. Chemogenetic manipulation of astrocytes activity in the dorsal striatum was sufficient to restore the cognitive defect in flexible behaviors induced by obesity, while manipulation of astrocyte in the nucleus accumbens led to acute change in whole-body substrate utilization and energy expenditure.

    "abstract": "In recent years, technology pertaining to nanobiomaterials has taken rapid strides, with the development of novel materials having unique properties. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have gained attention among these materials due to their high chemical stability, surface-to-volume ratio, and strong antimicrobial activity. The traditional method for synthesizing AgNPs involves toxic chemicals, which can have negative environmental impacts and pose health risks. Hence, there is a growing need for green synthesis methods for AgNPs that are environmentally friendly and safe for animal and human health. In this study, we explore the green synthesis of AgNPs using calyx from Abelmoschus esculentus, also known as okra, as an anthelmintic. Raillietina spp. is a common poultry parasite causing significant economic losses to the livestock industry. It is a major cause of ailment and mortality in livestock, deterring the host health. While chemical-based anthelmintic drugs are available, the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant parasite strains has made searching for new and effective treatments imperative. Although ethnomedicine has been promising for treating various diseases, including parasitic infections, nanoparticles have emerged as a viable alternative to traditional anthelmintic curative development. Our study aims at investigating the recent advances in nanomedicine, particularly AgNPs, as anthelmintic agents, which has shown remarkable alterations in the levels of tegumental enzymes, eventually leading to their paralysis and death. We discuss the mechanisms of action of AgNPs against Raillietina spp. and highlight the potential benefits of using biosynthesized curatives that interfere with the host-parasite interface to treat parasite-related disorders.",

However, the neural circuits and molecular mechanisms underlying these maladaptive behaviors remain elusive. Here, we report a pathway from vesicular glutamate transporter3 neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus to dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VGluT3DRN[-&gt;]DAVTA), of which population activity in response to innocuous mechanical stimuli and sucrose consumption, is respectively inhibited and attenuated by chronic neuropathic pain. Mechanistically, neuropathic pain dampens VGluT3DRN[-&gt;]DAVTA glutamatergic transmission and DAVTA neural excitability. VGluT3DRN[-&gt;]DAVTA activation alleviates neuropathic pain and comorbid depression-like behavior (CDB) by releasing glutamate, which subsequently promotes DA release in the nucleus accumbens medial shell (NAcMed) and produces analgesia and antidepressant effects via D2 and D1 receptors, respectively. In addition, VGluT3DRN[-&gt;]DAVTA inhibition produces pain-like hypersensitivity and depression-like behavior in healthy mice.

Often these regional baselines cannot be combined to produce broader geographical baselines. In cases where the mixture contains stocks spanning across a wide area a broad-scale baseline is created, but these baselines often are unable to resolve among regional stocks. Here, we introduce a new GSI method to harness the resolution capabilities of baselines developed for regional applications in the analyses of mixtures containing fish from a broad geographic range. This multistage process allows for disparate baselines to be used in a single integrated process that estimates the propagated errors from each stage. The baselines used by this model do not require any overlap in markers or in populations representing the broad-scale or regional baselines. The integrated multistage framework allows GSI of a wide geographic area without first developing a large scale, high resolution genetic baseline, or dividing a mixture sample into smaller regions beforehand. This approach is more cost-effective than updating range-wide baselines with all critical regionally important markers.",

    "abstract": "Implantable neuroelectronic interfaces have enabled significant advances in both fundamental research and treatment of neurological diseases, yet traditional intracranial depth electrodes require invasive surgery to place and can disrupt the neural networks during implantation. To address these limitations, we have developed an ultra-small and flexible endovascular neural probe that can be implanted into small 100-micron scale blood vessels in the brains of rodents without damaging the brain or vasculature. The structure and mechanical properties of the flexible probes were designed to meet the key constraints for implantation into tortuous blood vessels inaccessible with existing techniques. In vivo electrophysiology recording of local field potentials and single-unit spikes has been selectively achieved in the cortex and the olfactory bulb. Histology analysis of the tissue interface showed minimal immune response and long-term stability. This platform technology can be readily extended as both research tools and medical devices for the detection and intervention of neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "Therapies to revascularize ischemic tissue have long been a goal for the treatment of vascular disease and other disorders. Therapies using stem cell factor (SCF), also known as a c-Kit ligand, had great promise for treating ischemia for myocardial infarct and stroke, however clinical development for SCF was stopped due to toxic side effects including mast cell activation in patients. We recently developed a novel therapy using a transmembrane form of SCF (tmSCF) delivered in lipid nanodiscs. In previous studies, we demonstrated tmSCF nanodiscs were able to induce revascularization of ischemia limbs in mice and did not activate mast cells. To advance this therapeutic towards clinical application, we tested this therapy in an advanced model of hindlimb ischemia in rabbits with hyperlipidemia and diabetes. This model has therapeutic resistance to angiogenic therapies and maintains long term deficits in recovery from ischemic injury. We treated rabbits with local treatment with tmSCF nanodiscs or control solution delivered locally from an alginate gel delivered into the ischemic limb of the rabbits. After eight weeks, we found significantly higher vascularity in the tmSCF nanodisc-treated group in comparison to alginate treated control as quantified through angiography. Histological analysis also showed a significantly higher number of small and large blood vessels in the ischemic muscles of the tmSCF nanodisc treated group. Importantly, we did not observe inflammation or mast cell activation in the rabbits. Overall, this study supports the therapeutic potential of tmSCF nanodiscs for treating peripheral ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Tissue biology involves an intricate balance between cell-intrinsic processes and interactions between cells organized in specific spatial patterns, which can be respectively captured by single-cell profiling methods, such as single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), and histology imaging data, such as Hematoxylin-and-Eosin (H&E) stains. While single-cell profiles provide rich molecular information, they can be challenging to collect routinely and do not have spatial resolution. Conversely, histological H&E assays have been a cornerstone of tissue pathology for decades, but do not directly report on molecular details, although the observed structure they capture arises from molecules and cells. Here, we leverage adversarial machine learning to develop SCHAF (Single-Cell omics from Histology Analysis Framework), to generate a tissue samples spatially-resolved single-cell omics dataset from its H&E histology image. We demonstrate SCHAF on two types of human tumors--from lung and metastatic breast cancer--training with matched samples analyzed by both sc/snRNA-seq and by H&E staining. SCHAF generated appropriate single-cell profiles from histology images in test data, related them spatially, and compared well to ground-truth scRNA-Seq, expert pathologist annotations, or direct MERFISH measurements. SCHAF opens the way to next-generation H&E2.0 analyses and an integrated understanding of cell and tissue biology in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) systems have been used for diverse applications, from prototyping gene circuits to providing a platform for the development of synthetic life, but their performance is limited by issues such as batch-to-batch variability, poor predictability, and limited lifetime. These issues stem largely from the fact that cell lysate contains an active and complex metabolism whose effect on TX-TL has remained largely uncharacterized.\n\nMotivated by a minimal model of cell-free metabolism, this work explored the effects of energy molecules, which power TX-TL, and fuel molecules, which regenerate energy by harnessing core metabolism, on an E. coli-based TX-TL system. This work reports a compensatory interaction between TX-TL components Mg+2 and 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA, used to regenerate ATP), where if one components concentration is increased, the others must likewise be increased to maintain optimal translation. Furthermore, maximum total mRNA and protein production occur in different and opposite concentration regimes of Mg+2 and 3-PGA. To explore the observed phenomenon, transcription and translation were decoupled. Under translation inhibition, transcriptional output was uniform across Mg+2 and 3-PGA concentrations, but in a translation-only system, maximum protein production occurred in the previously found optimal regime of Mg+2 and 3-PGA, suggesting a TX-TL trade-off. Using alternative fuels to regenerate energy, this work found that the trade-off is universal across the different fuel sources, and that a systems position along the trade-off is determined strongly by Mg+2 and DNA concentrations. In systems where additional energy is supplied and where a fuel source is absent, the trade-off is absent, suggesting the trade-off arises from limitations in the regulation of translation and efficient energy regeneration. This work represents a significant advancement in understanding the effects of fuel and energy metabolism on TX-TL in cell-free systems and lays the foundation for improving TX-TL performance, lifetime, standardization, and prediction.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association analysis of electroencephalographic endophenotypes for alcohol use disorder has identified non-coding polymorphisms within the KCNJ6 gene. KCNJ6 encodes the GIRK2 protein, a subunit of a G-protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channel that regulates neuronal excitability. To elucidate how GIRK2 affects neuronal excitability and the response to ethanol exposure, we upregulated KCNJ6 in human glutamatergic neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells using two distinct strategies: CRISPRa induction and lentiviral expression. Multi-electrode-arrays, calcium imaging, patch-clamp electrophysiology, and mitochondrial stress tests collectively show that elevated GIRK2 acts in concert with 7-21 days of ethanol exposure to inhibit neuronal activity, to counteract ethanol-induced increases in glutamate sensitivity, and to promote an increase intrinsic excitability. Furthermore, ethanol exposure did not alter basal nor activity-dependent mitochondrial respiration in elevated GIRK2 neurons. These data highlight a role for GIRK2 in mitigating the effects of ethanol on neuronal glutamatergic signaling and mitochondrial activity.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=114 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/533236v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17c0737org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bde616org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4cb14borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10bef9a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is associated with severe COVID-19 and adverse fetal outcomes, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Moreover, clinical studies assessing therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy are limited. To address these gaps, we developed a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Outbred CD1 mice were infected at embryonic day (E) 6, E10, or E16 with a mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 (maSCV2) virus. Outcomes were gestational age-dependent, with greater morbidity, reduced anti-viral immunity, greater viral titers, and more adverse fetal outcomes occurring with infection at E16 (3rd trimester-equivalent) than with infection at either E6 (1st trimester-equivalent) or E10 (2nd trimester-equivalent). To assess the efficacy of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (recommended for pregnant individuals with COVID-19), we treated E16-infected dams with mouse equivalent doses of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir. Treatment reduced pulmonary viral titers, decreased maternal morbidity, and prevented adverse offspring outcomes. Our results highlight that severe COVID-19 during pregnancy and adverse fetal outcomes are associated with heightened virus replication in maternal lungs. Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir mitigated adverse maternal and fetal outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings prompt the need for further consideration of pregnancy in preclinical and clinical studies of therapeutics against viral infections.",

    "abstract": "Many poxviruses are significant human and animal pathogens, including viruses that cause smallpox and mpox. Identification of inhibitors of poxvirus replication is critical for drug development to manage poxvirus threats. Here we tested two compounds, nucleoside trifluridine and nucleotide adefovir dipivoxil, for antiviral activities against vaccinia virus (VACV) and mpox virus (MPXV) in physiologically relevant primary human fibroblasts. Both trifluridine and adefovir dipivoxil potently inhibited replication of VACV and MPXV (MA001 2022 isolate) in a plaque assay. Upon further characterization, they both conferred high potency in inhibiting VACV replication with half maximal effective concentrations (EC50) at low nanomolar levels in our recently developed assay based on a recombinant VACV secreted Gaussia luciferase. Our results further validated that the recombinant VACV with Gaussia luciferase secretion is a highly reliable, rapid, non-disruptive, and simple reporter tool for identification and chracterization of poxvirus inhibitors. Both compounds inhibited VACV DNA replication and downstream viral gene expression. Given that both compounds are FDA-approved drugs, and trifluridine is used to treat ocular vaccinia in medical practice due to its antiviral activity, our results suggest that it holds great promise to further test trifluridine and adefovir dipivoxil for countering poxvirus infection, including mpox.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria acquire P primarily as inorganic orthophosphate (Pi, PO43-). Once internalized, Pi is rapidly assimilated into biomass during the synthesis of ATP. Because Pi is essential, but excessive ATP is toxic, the acquisition of environmental Pi is tightly regulated. In the bacterium Salmonella enterica (Salmonella), growth in Pi-limiting environments activates the membrane sensor histidine kinase PhoR, leading to the phosphorylation of its cognate transcriptional regulator PhoB and subsequent transcription of genes involved in adaptations to low Pi. Pi limitation is thought to promote PhoR kinase activity by altering the conformation of a membrane signaling complex comprised by PhoR, the multicomponent Pi transporter system PstSACB and the regulatory protein PhoU. However, the identity of the low Pi signal and how it controls PhoR activity remain unknown. Here we characterize the PhoB-dependent and independent transcriptional changes elicited by Salmonella in response to P starvation, and identify PhoB-independent genes that are required for the utilization of several organic-P sources. We use this knowledge to identify the cellular compartment where the PhoR signaling complex senses the Pi-limiting signal. We demonstrate that the PhoB and PhoR signal transduction proteins can be maintained in an inactive state even when Salmonella is grown in media lacking Pi. Our results establish that PhoR activity is controlled by an intracellular signal resulting from P insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "During tuberculosis (TB) infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a sub-population of mycobacteria can enter a non-replicating persistent state that is not susceptible to most frontline TB drugs, resulting in phenotypic antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which contributes to an extended duration of TB therapy, frequent non-compliance and disease relapse. Recent clinical trial data indicated that inclusion of the fluoroquinolone Moxifloxacin (MXF) led to a shortening of TB treatment from 6-months to 4-months. MXF, however, has limited efficacy on Mtb persisting in a hypoxic environment. Here, we report a prodrug approach significantly enhancing MXFs lethality against non-replicating hypoxic Mtb while retaining its effectiveness against replicating Mtb. Since hypoxia is associated with a reductive environment and induces the expression of reductive enzymes such as nitroreducatases (NTRs) in Mtb, we designed and synthesized a library of nitroaryl and nitroheteroaryl conjugates of MXF. After optimization of several factors, including reduction potential, rate, and efficiency of drug release, as well as selectivity, we identified 2-nitrothiazole-derivative as a prodrug that is rapidly and nearly quantitatively converted to MXF in the presence of NTR. Biochemical studies supported by computational data reveal a rate-limiting influence of electron transfer in the mechanistic pathway for activation of the nitroaryl group, a key step in prodrug activation leading to drug release. The lead prodrugs potency against replicating bacteria in both cellular and animal model studies, and mode of action is nearly identical to MXF with significantly higher lethality against non-replicating Mtb than MXF. The prodrug showed improved accumulation of MXF inside non-replicating Mtb when compared with MXF alone, likely due to the prodrugs ability to enhance accumulation of MXF within non-replicating Mtb. Hence, together, the newly developed 2-nitrothiazole-prodrug is rapidly, efficiently, and selectively cleaved under reductive conditions to produce the active drug and had superior permeability and accumulation in non-replicating Mtb, which likely contributes to its increased efficacy. This proof-of-concept study supports prodrug approaches with a focus on improving accumulation of the active drug within non-replicating pathogens as a strategy to address phenotypic AMR.\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

Community-acquired S. aureus strains produce high levels of PSMs in planktonic cultures, and PSM alpha peptides have been shown to augment the release of extracellular membrane vesicles (MVs). We observed that amyloids, aggregates of proteins characterized by a fibrillar morphology and stained with specific dyes, co-purified with MVs harvested from cell-free culture supernatants of community-acquired S. aureus strains. {delta}-toxin was a major component of amyloid fibrils that co-purified with strain LAC MVs, and {delta}-toxin promoted the production of MVs and amyloid fibrils in a dose-dependent manner. To determine whether MVs and amyloid fibrils were generated under in vivo conditions, we inoculated mice with S. aureus harvested from planktonic cultures. Bacterial MVs could be isolated and purified from lavage fluids recovered from infected animals. Although {delta}-toxin was the most abundant PSM in lavage fluids, amyloid fibrils could not be detected in these samples. Our findings expand our understanding of amyloid fibril formation in S. aureus cultures, reveal important roles of {delta}-toxin in amyloid fibril formation and MV biogenesis, and demonstrate that MVs are generated in vivo in a staphylococcal infection model.\n\nImportanceExtracellular membrane vesicles (MVs) produced by Staphylococcus aureus in planktonic cultures encapsulate a diverse cargo of bacterial proteins, nucleic acids, and glycopolymers that are protected from destruction by external factors. {delta}-toxin, a member of the phenol soluble modulin family, was shown to be critical for MV biogenesis. Amyloid fibrils co-purified with MVs generated by virulent, community-acquired S. aureus strains, and fibril formation was dependent on expression of the S. aureus {delta}-toxin gene (hld). Mass spectrometry data confirmed that the amyloid fibrils were comprised of {delta}-toxin. Although S. aureus MVs were produced in vivo in a localized murine infection model, amyloid fibrils were not observed in the in vivo setting. Our findings provide critical insights into staphylococcal factors involved in MV biogenesis and amyloid formation.",

    "abstract": "The epidemiology of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, the leading cause of seafood-borne gastroenteritis world-wide, dramatically changed in the United States following the translocation and establishment of a Pacific lineage of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, sequence type (ST) 36, into the Atlantic. In this study we used phylogeography based on traceback locations and comparative genomics to identify features that promoted evolution, dispersal, and competitive dominance of ST36. This revealed a striking shuffling of filamentous prophage in the family Inoviridae (inoviruses), including loss of a prophage that had been maintained for decades, accompanied modern diversification and competitive replacement of the endemic north Pacific population. Subsequently, at least five distinct progenitors arising from this diversification translocated from the Pacific into the Atlantic and established four geographically defined clonal subpopulations with remarkably low migration or mixing. Founders of two prevailing Atlantic subpopulations each acquired new diagnostic inoviruses while other subpopulations that apparently declined did not. Broader surveys indicate inoviruses are common and active among the global population of V. parahaemolyticus and though parallel inovirus replacements, such as in ST36, appear infrequent, they are notable in pathogenic lineages that dispersed.\n\nImportanceAn understanding of the processes that contribute to emergence of pathogens from environmental reservoirs is critical as changing climate precipitates pathogen evolution and population expansion. Phylogeographic analysis of Vibrio parahaemolyticus hosts combined with analysis of their Inoviridae phage resolved ambiguities of diversification dynamics which preceded successful Atlantic invasion by the epidemiologically predominant ST36 lineage. It has been established experimentally that filamentous phage can limit host recombination, but here we show that phage loss is linked to rapid bacterial host diversification during epidemic spread in natural ecosystems alluding to a potential role for ubiquitous inoviruses in the adaptability of pathogens. This work paves the way for functional analyses to define the contribution of inoviruses in the evolutionary dynamics of environmentally transmitted pathogens.",

We found over 200 putative horizontally transferred elements within bats; sixteen transposons were shared across distantly related mammalian clades and two other elements were shared with a fish and two lizard species. Our results indicate that bats are a hotspot for horizontal transfer of DNA transposons.

    "abstract": "Cross-species virus transmission events can lead to dire public health emergencies in the form of epidemics and pandemics. One example in animals is the emergence of the H3N8 equine influenza virus (EIV), first isolated in 1963 in Miami, Florida, USA, after emerging among horses in South America. In the early 21st century the American lineage of EIV diverged into two  Florida clades that persist today, while an EIV transferred to dogs around 1999 and gave rise to the H3N8 canine influenza virus (CIV), first reported in 2004. Here, we compare CIV in dogs and EIV in horses to reveal their host-specific evolution, to determine the sources and connections between significant outbreaks, and to gain insight into the factors controlling their different evolutionary fates. H3N8 CIV only circulated in North America, was geographically restricted after the first few years, and went extinct in 2016. Of the two EIV Florida clades, clade 1 circulates widely and shows frequent transfers between the USA and South America, Europe and elsewhere, while clade 2 was globally distributed early after it emerged, but since about 2018 has only been detected in Central Asia. Any potential zoonotic threat of these viruses to humans can only be determined with an understanding of its natural history and evolution. Our comparative analysis of these three viral lineages reveals distinct patterns and rates of sequence variation yet with similar overall evolution between clades, suggesting epidemiological intervention strategies for possible eradication of H3N8 EIV.

The H3N8 equine influenza virus (EIV) emerged in 1963 by transfer of an avian influenza virus, and the H3N8 canine influenza virus (CIV) subsequently emerged in 1999 when EIV transferred to dogs. H3N8 CIV persistently circulated in only a few locations in the USA, and has not been detected since 2016. In the same period H3N8 EIV has circulated as two separate clades, one in North America and other regions of the world, while the other currently appears to be found only in Central Asia. By comparing the hosts, epidemiology, and evolution of these influenza viruses we explain how these lineages had different evolutionary fates, and show why elucidating these evolutionary processes is key to understanding zoonotic disease and viral emergence.

    "abstract": "Homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) are ubiquitous selfish elements that generate targeted double-stranded DNA breaks, facilitating the recombination of the HEG DNA sequence into the break site and contributing to the evolutionary dynamics of HEG-encoding genomes. Bacteriophages (phages) are well-documented to carry HEGs, with the paramount characterization of HEGs being focused on those encoded by coliphage T4. Recently, it has been observed that the highly sampled vibriophage, ICP1, is similarly enriched with HEGs distinct from T4s. Here, we examined the HEGs encoded by ICP1 and diverse phages, proposing HEG-driven mechanisms that contribute to phage evolution. Relative to ICP1 and T4, we found a variable distribution of HEGs across phages, with HEGs frequently encoded proximal to or within essential genes. We identified large regions (> 10kb) of high nucleotide identity flanked by HEGs, deemed HEG islands, which we hypothesize to be mobilized by the activity of flanking HEGs. Finally, we found examples of domain swapping between phage-encoded HEGs and genes encoded by other phages and phage satellites. We anticipate that HEGs have a larger impact on the evolutionary trajectory of phages than previously appreciated and that future work investigating the role of HEGs in phage evolution will continue to highlight these observations.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus agnetis is an emerging pathogen in chickens but has been most commonly isolated from sub-clinical mastitis in bovines. Previous whole-genome analyses for known virulence genes failed to identify determinants for the switch from mild ductal infections in cattle to severe infections in poultry. We now report identification of a family of 15 kbp, 17-19 gene mobile genetic elements (MGEs) specific to chicken osteomyelitis and dermatitis isolates of S. agnetis. These MGEs can be present in multiple copies per genome. The MGE has been vectored on a Staphylococcus phage that separately lysogenized two S. agnetis osteomyelitis strains. The S. agnetis genome from a broiler breeder case of ulcerative dermatitis contains 2 orthologs of this MGE, not associated with a prophage. BLASTn and phylogenetic analyses show that there are closely related intact MGEs found in genomes of S. aureus. The genome from a 1980s isolate from chickens in Ireland contains 3 copies of this MGE. More recent chicken isolates descended from that genome (Poland 2009, Oklahoma 2010, and Arkansas 2018) contain 2 to 4 related copies. Many of the genes of this MGE can be identified in disparate regions of the genomes of other chicken isolates of S. aureus. BLAST searches of the NCBI databases detect no similar MGEs outside of S. aureus and S. agnetis. These MGEs encode no proteins related to those produced by Staphylococcus aureus Pathogenicity Islands, which have been associated with the transition of S. aureus from human to chicken hosts. Other than mobilization functions, most of the genes in these new MGEs annotate as hypothetical proteins. The MGEs we describe appear to represent a new family of Chromosomal Islands (CIs) shared amongst S. agnetis and S. aureus. Further work is needed to understand the role of these CIs/MGEs in pathogenesis. Analysis of horizontal transfer of genetic elements between isolates and species of Staphylococci provides clues to evolution of host-pathogen interactions as well as revealing critical determinants for animal welfare and human diseases.",

Although short-read sequencing is now frequently used to examine TE expression, the highly repetitive nature of TEs limits their accurate quantification at the locus-specific level. We have developed LocusMasterTE, an improved method that integrates information from long-read RNA sequencing to enhance TE quantification. The fractional transcript per million (TPM) from long reads serves as a prior distribution during the Expectation-Maximization (EM) model in short-read TE quantification, thereby enabling the reassignment of multi-mapped reads to correct expression values. Using simulated short-reads, our results indicate that LocusMasterTE outperforms existing quantitative approaches and is especially favorable for quantifying evolutionarily younger TEs. Using matched cell line RNA-seq data, we further demonstrate improved locus-specific TE quantification by LocusMasterTE with stronger enrichment in active, and depletion at repressive, histone marks. Finally, by integrating colorectal cancer cell line long-read sequencing data with short read RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas colorectal cancer cohort, we demonstrate LocusMasterTEs ability to identify survival-related TEs and uncover new expression associations between locus-specific TEs and neighboring genes.

Mechanistically, ACOT 12&8 are dramatically upregulated in liver to convert FFA-derived acetyl-CoA to acetate and CoA. This conversion not only provides large amount of acetate which fuels brain preferentially rather than muscle, but also recycles CoA which is required for sustained fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis.

    "abstract": "Mutations in KRAS are common drivers of human cancers and are often those with the poorest overall prognosis for patients. A recently developed compound, MRTX1133 has shown promise in inhibiting the KRASG12D mutant protein, which is a primary driver mutation in pancreatic cancer cases worldwide. In this study, I performed a multi-omic analysis of four cancer cell lines following acute treatment with this compound. To obtain increased granularity in the observed proteomic observation, I attempted to perform multiplexed single cell proteomics on all four cell lines with a goal of over 500 single cells per treatment condition. Due to a high level of cellular death and morphological changes induced in the two mutant cell lines following drug treatment, only two cell lines could be analyzed with this approach. The final results provided in this draft contain results from approximately 1,800 single cells from two cell lines which each harbor two copies of the KRASG12D mutant gene. From these files 3,140 total proteins were identified with approximately 953 proteins quantified per cell. These results were sufficient to differentiate between single pancreatic cancer cells derived from different patients. In addition, I present observations suggesting new challenges to consider in pharmacological applications for single cell proteomics, including biases related to how the carrier channels are prepared and how single cells are selected or aliquoted. By sorting for viable cells following drug treatment that leads to high levels of cell death, I obtain very different results than when the entire populations are homogenized for bulk proteomics. These results suggest new questions for the application of single cell proteomics, and perhaps proteomics itself, when studying drug treatments that can result in diverse cellular responses including high cell death.

Here, analysis of X-ray crystal structures within a curated database (HLA3DB) shows that pHLA complexes encompassing multiple HLA allotypes present a discrete set of peptide backbone conformations. Leveraging these representative backbones, we employ a regression model trained on terms of a physically relevant energy function to develop a comparative modeling approach for nonamer peptide/HLA structures named RepPred. Our method outperforms the top pHLA modeling approach by up to 19% in terms of structural accuracy, and consistently predicts blind targets not included in our training set.

    "abstract": "Elucidating the biosynthetic pathways of natural products has been a major focus of biochemistry and pharmacy. However, predicting the whole pathways from target molecules to metabolic building blocks remains a challenge. Here we propose READRetro as a practical bio-retrosynthesis tool for planning the biosynthetic pathways of natural products. READRetro effectively resolves the tradeoff between generalizability and memorability in bio-retrosynthesis by implementing two separate modules; each module is responsible for either generalizability or memorability. Specifically, READRetro utilizes a rule-based retriever for memorability and an ensemble of two dual-representation-based deep learning models for generalizability. Through extensive experiments, READRetro was demonstrated to outperform existing models by a large margin in terms of both generalizability and memorability. READRetro was also capable of predicting the known pathways of complex plant secondary metabolites such as monoterpene indole alkaloids, demonstrating its applicability in the real-world bio-retrosynthesis planning of natural products. A website (https://readretro.net) and open-source code have been provided for READRetro, a practical tool with state-of-the-art performance for natural product biosynthesis research.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative understanding of cellular processes, such as cell cycle and differentiation, is impeded by various forms of complexity ranging from myriad molecular players and their multilevel regulatory interactions, cellular evolution with multiple intermediate stages, lack of elucidation of cause-effect relationships among the many system players, and the computational complexity associated with the profusion of variables and parameters. In this paper, we present an elegant modeling framework based on the cybernetic concept that biological regulation is inspired by objectives embedding entirely novel strategies for dimension reduction, process stage specification through the system dynamics, and innovative causal association of regulatory events with the ability to predict the evolution of the dynamical system. The elementary step of the modeling strategy involves stage-specific objective functions that are computationally-determined from experiments, augmented with dynamical network computations involving end point objective functions, mutual information, change point detection, and maximal clique centrality. We demonstrate the power of the method through application to the mammalian cell cycle, which involves thousands of biomolecules engaged in signaling, transcription, and regulation. Starting with a fine-grained transcriptional description obtained from RNA sequencing measurements, we develop an initial model, which is then dynamically modeled using the cybernetic-inspired method (CIM), utilizing the strategies described above. The CIM is able to distill the most significant interactions from a multitude of possibilities. In addition to capturing the complexity of regulatory processes in a mechanistically causal and stage-specific manner, we identify the functional network modules, including novel cell cycle stages. Our model is able to predict future cell cycles consistent with experimental measurements. We posit that this state-of-the-art framework has the promise to extend to the dynamics of other biological processes, with a potential to provide novel mechanistic insights.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCECellular processes like cell cycle are overly complex, involving multiple players interacting at multiple levels, and explicit modeling of such systems is challenging. The availability of longitudinal RNA measurements provides an opportunity to \"reverse-engineer\" for novel regulatory models. We develop a novel framework, inspired using goal-oriented cybernetic model, to implicitly model transcriptional regulation by constraining the system using inferred temporal goals. A preliminary causal network based on information-theory is used as a starting point, and our framework is used to distill the network to temporally-based networks containing essential molecular players. The strength of this approach is its ability to dynamically model the RNA temporal measurements. The approach developed paves the way for inferring regulatory processes in many complex cellular processes.",

Here, we investigated (1) brain activity correlates of such response-code conflicts, (2) activity modulations by individual dual-task performance and related cognitive abilities, (3) task-modulated connectivity within the task network, and (4)age-related differences in all these aspects. Young and older adults underwent fMRI while responding to the pitch of tones through spatially mapped speeded button presses with one or two hands concurrently. Using opposing stimulus-response mappings between hands, we induced conflict between simultaneously activated response codes. These response-code conflicts elicited activation in key regions of the multiple-demand network. Older adults showed non-compensatory hyperactivity in left superior frontal gyrus, and higher left intraparietal sulcus activity associated with lower attentional performance. While motor and parietal areas of the conflict-related network were modulated by attentional and task-switching abilities, efficient conflict resolution in dual-tasking was linked to suppressing visual cortex activity. Finally, connectivity between premotor or parietal seed regions and the conflict-sensitive network was neither conflict-specific nor age-sensitive. Overall, resolving dual-task response-code conflict recruited substantial parts of the multiple-demand network, whose activity and coupling, however, were only little affected by individual differences in task performance or age.",

We demonstrate that condensates form after passing a threshold concentration, maintain a soluble fraction, dissolve upon shifts in temperature and concentration, and exhibit dynamics consistent with internal rearrangement and exchange between condensed and soluble fractions. We also discovered that an established marker for insoluble protein aggregates, IbpA, has different colocalization patterns with bacterial condensates and aggregates, demonstrating its applicability as a reporter to differentiate the two in vivo.

    "abstract": "Herpetofauna monitoring can be strongly limited by terrain accessibility, impeding our understanding of species ecology and thus challenging their conservation. This is particularly true for species living in the canopy, on cliffs or in dense vegetation. Remote sensing imagery may fill this gap by offering a cost-effective monitoring approach allowing to improve species detection in inaccessible areas. We investigated the applicability of drone-based monitoring for a Critically Endangered insular gecko (Phelsuma inexpectata) and two invasive alien species representing a risk for the former (P. grandis and P. laticauda). We determined the approach distance before inducing behavioural response caused by the drones presence. All three study species showed no reaction to the drones presence until very close distances (mean distance for P. inexpectata: 33.8 cm; P. grandis: 21.9 cm; P. laticauda: 26.4 cm). We then performed horizontal and vertical approaches, taking photos every meter starting at 10 m away from the canopy edge to determine an optimal distance for detection while ensuring species-level identification. We examined a total of 328 photos. We found a bimodality in the number of detected geckos, with different individuals recorded between short and intermediate distances. Therefore, we recommend taking photos at two distances of 2-2.5 m and 5 m away from the canopy, ideally facing away from the sun and in low wind conditions. We encourage the application of our methodology for Phelsuma spp., but also for other species of similar size and ecology to improve detection in inaccessible areas.",

    "abstract": "Germplasm resource is the source of herbal medicine production. Cultivation of superior germplasm resources helps to resolve the serious conflict between long-term population persistence and growing market demand by producing materials with high quality consistently. Cibotium barometz is the original plant of cibotii rhizoma (\"Gouji\"), a traditional Chinese medicine used in the therapy of pain, weakness, and numbness of lower extremity. Long-history use of Cibotium has rendered wild populations of this species declined seriously in China. Without sufficient understanding of species and lineage diversity of Cibotium, it is difficult to propose a targeted conservation scheme at present, let alone selecting high-quality germplasm resources. In order to fill such a knowledge gap, this study sampled C. barometz and relative species throughout their distribution in China, performed genome skimming to obtain plastome data, and conducted phylogenomic analyses. We constructed a well-supported plastome phylogeny of Chinese Cibotium, which showed that three species with significant genetic difference distributed in China, namely C. barometz, C. cumingii, and C. sino-burmaense, a cryptic species endemic to NW Yunnan and adjacent region of NE Myanmar. Moreover, our results revealed two differentiated lineages of C. barometz distributed in the east and west side of a classic phylogeographic boundary that probably shaped by monsoons and landforms in China. We also evaluated the resolution of nine traditional barcode loci, and designed five new DNA barcodes based on the plastome data which can discriminate all these species and lineages of Chinese Cibotium accurately. These novel findings integrated genetic basis will guide conservation planners and medicinal plant breeders to build systematic conservation plans and exploit germplasm resources of Cibotium in China.",

The Rad51 protein is central to HR, but multiple auxiliary factors regulate its activity. The heterodimeric Swi5-Sfr1 complex is one such factor. It was previously shown that two sites within the intrinsically disordered domain of Sfr1 are critical for the interaction with Rad51. Here, we show that phosphorylation of five residues within this domain regulates the interaction of Swi5-Sfr1 with Rad51. Biochemical reconstitutions demonstrated that a phosphomimetic mutant version of Swi5-Sfr1 is defective in both the physical and functional interaction with Rad51. This translated to a defect in DNA repair, with the phosphomimetic mutant yeast strain phenocopying the previously established interaction mutant. Interestingly, a strain in which Sfr1 phosphorylation was blocked also displayed sensitivity to DNA damage. Taken together, we propose that controlled phosphorylation of Sfr1 is important for the role of Swi5-Sfr1 in promoting Rad51-dependent DNA repair.",

Using PL-Seq, we identified genes that exhibit significant differences in CE splicing depending on connectivity to short versus long 3UTRs.

    "abstract": "Study of fibroblast biology, including the process of fibroblast activation, is critical to our understanding of wound healing, tissue fibrosis, and cancer. However, the rapid adoption of next-generation sequencing technologies, particularly single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics, has revealed that fibroblast heterogeneity of both healthy and pathological tissues is more complicated than we currently understand. Therefore, a better understanding of molecular players that are not only indicative of but also that contribute to fibroblast activation is critical to piecing together the complete picture and to informing therapeutic strategies to combat associated pathologies. Here we focus on a long-noncoding RNA, LINC01013, recently implicated in pathological activation of cardiac fibroblasts and valvular interstitial cell. We analyze several sets of publicly available human transcriptomic data with the aim of determining whether LINC01013 correlates with fibroblast activation state, and whether compounds that affect fibroblast activation also modulate expression of LINC01013. We find that, in numerous independent datasets of healthy and diseased human fibroblasts, LINC01013 expression is associated with fibroblast activation. We also describe that, even in datasets comprised of small sample sizes, statistically significant correlations exist between expression of LINC01013 and expression of fibroblast activation markers ACTA2 and CCN2. This finding, while preliminary, suggests that changes in LINC01013 expression may be an indicator of changes in fibroblast activation state, and that LINC01013 might functionally contribute to fibroblast activation, lending potential rationale for greater exploration of this lncRNA in the context of tissue fibrosis or tumor stroma.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in Western countries. There is growing evidence that dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and disruption of microbiota-host interactions contribute to the pathology of NAFLD. We previously demonstrated that gut microbiota derived tryptophan metabolite indole-3-acetate (I3A) was decreased in both cecum and liver of high-fat diet-fed mice and attenuated the expression of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages and TNF-a and fatty acid induced inflammatory responses in an aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) dependent manner in hepatocytes. In this study, we investigated the effect of orally administered I3A in a mouse model of diet induced NAFLD. Western diet (WD)-fed mice given sugar water (SW) with I3A showed dramatically decreased serum ALT, hepatic TG, liver steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, lobular inflammation, and hepatic production of inflammatory cytokines, compared to WD-fed mice given only SW. Metagenomic analysis show that I3A administration did not significantly modify the intestinal microbiome, suggesting that I3As beneficial effects likely reflect the metabolites direct actions on the liver. Administration of I3A partially reversed WD induced alterations of liver metabolome and proteome, notably, decreasing expression of several enzymes in hepatic lipogenesis and {beta}- oxidation. Mechanistically, we also show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) mediates the anti-inflammatory effects of I3A in macrophages. The potency of I3A in alleviating liver steatosis and inflammation clearly demonstrates its potential as a therapeutic modality for preventing the progression of steatosis to NASH.",

    "abstract": "The oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET) occurs in the absence of new transcription and relies on post-transcriptional gene regulation, including translational control by mRNA poly(A) tail regulation, where cytoplasmic polyadenylation activates translation and deadenylation leads to translational repression and decay. However, how the transcriptome-wide landscape of mRNA poly(A) tails shapes translation across the OET in mammals remains unknown. Here, we performed long-read RNA sequencing to uncover poly(A) tail lengths and mRNA abundance transcriptome-wide in mice across five stages of development from oocyte to embryo. Integrating these data with recently published ribosome profiling data, we demonstrate that poly(A) tail length is coupled to translational efficiency across the entire OET. We uncover an extended wave of global deadenylation during fertilization, which sets up a switch in translation control between the oocyte and embryo. In the oocyte, short-tailed maternal mRNAs that resist deadenylation in the oocyte are translationally activated, whereas large groups of mRNAs deadenylated without decay in the oocyte are later readenylated to drive translation activation in the early embryo. Our findings provide an important resource and insight into the mechanisms by which cytoplasmic polyadenylation and deadenylation dynamically shape poly(A) tail length in a stage-specific manner to orchestrate development from oocyte to embryo in mammals.",

    "abstract": "G-proteins function as molecular switches to power cofactor translocation and confer fidelity in metal trafficking. MMAA, a G-protein motor, together with MMAB, an adenosyltransferase, orchestrate cofactor delivery and repair of B12-dependent human methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MMUT). The mechanism by which the motor assembles and moves a >1300 Da cargo, or fails in disease, are poorly understood. Herein, we report the crystal structure of the human MMUT-MMAA nanomotor assembly, which reveals a dramatic 180{degrees} rotation of the B12 domain, exposing it to solvent. The nanomotor complex, stabilized by MMAA wedging between two MMUT domains, leads to ordering of the switch I and III loops, revealing the molecular basis of mutase-dependent GTPase activation. The structure explains the biochemical penalties incurred by methylmalonic aciduria-causing mutations that reside at the newly identified MMAA-MMUT interfaces.",

    "abstract": "MotivationTo predict novel drug targets, graph-based machine learning methods have been widely used to capture the relationships between drug, target, and disease entities in heterogeneous biological networks. However, most of the existing methods cannot explicitly consider disease types when predicting targets. More importantly, drug-disease-target (DDT) networks could exhibit multi-relational hierarchical sub-structures with the information of biological interactive functions, but these methods, especially those based on Euclidean space embedding cannot fully utilize such topology information, which might lead to sub-optimal prediction results. We hypothesized that, by properly importing hyperbolic space embedding specifically for modeling hierarchical DDT networks, graph-based machine learning algorithms could better capture the relationships between aforementioned entities, which ultimately improves the target prediction performance.\n\nResultsTo test our hypothesis, we formulated the drug target prediction problem as a knowledge graph triple completion task explicitly considering disease types. To solve this problem, we proposed FLONE, a novel hyperbolic Lorentz space embedding-based method to capture the hierarchical structural information in the DDT network when inferring drug targets. We evaluated it on two different DDT networks, our experimental results showed that by introducing Lorentz space, one of the isomorphic models of hyperbolic space, FLONE generates more accurate candidate target predictions given the drug and disease than the Euclidean translation-based counterparts, which supports our hypothesis. Beyond these experiments, we also devised the hyperbolic encoders to fuse drug and target similarity information into FLONE, to make it capable to handle triples corresponding to previously unseen drugs and targets for more challenging prediction scenarios.\n\nAvailability and implementationSource code and dataset information are at: https://github.com/arantir123/DDT_triple_prediction.\n\nContacts.he@cs.bham.ac.uk",

    "abstract": "Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA), which involves amyloid deposition in blood vessels leading to fatal cerebral hemorrhage and recurring strokes, is present in the majority Alzheimers disease cases. Familial mutations in the amyloid {beta} peptide is correlated to higher risks of CAA, and are mostly comprised of mutations at residues 22 and 23. While the structure of the wild type A{beta} peptide has been investigated in great detail, less is known about the structure of mutants involved in CAA and evolutions thereof. This is particularly true for mutations at residue 22, for which detailed molecular structures, as typically determined from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy or electron microscopy, do not exist. In this report, we have used nanoscale infrared (IR) spectroscopy augmented with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM-IR) to investigate structural evolution of the A{beta} Dutch mutant (E22Q) at the single aggregate level. We show that that in the oligomeric stage, the structural ensemble is distinctly bimodal, with the two subtypes differing with respect to population of parallel {beta}-sheets. Fibrils on the other hand are structurally homogeneous, with early-stage fibrils distinctly anti parallel in character, which develop parallel {beta}-sheets upon maturation. Furthermore, the antiparallel structure is found to be a persistent feature across different stages of aggregation.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in neurodevelopmental biology is how flexibly the nervous system changes during development. To address this, we reconstructed the complete connectome of dauer, an alternative developmental stage of nematodes with distinct behavioral characteristics, by volumetric reconstruction and automated synapse detection using deep learning. With the basic architecture of the nervous system preserved, structural changes in neurons, large or small, were closely associated with connectivity changes, which in turn evoked dauer-specific behaviors such as nictation. Graph theoretical analyses revealed significant dauer-specific rewiring of sensory neuron connectivity and increased clustering within motor neurons in the dauer connectome. We suggest that the nervous system in the nematode, probably animals in general, has evolved to respond to harsh environments by reversibly developing a quantitatively and qualitatively differentiated connectome.",
