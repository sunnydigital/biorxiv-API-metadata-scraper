    "abstract": "Coordination of cell division and differentiation is critical for tissue patterning during organ development. Directional signaling and cell polarity have important roles in coordination of these processes. For instance, the Arabidopsis receptor-like kinase INFLORESCENCE AND ROOT APICES KINASE (IRK) functions to restrict stele area and repress longitudinal anticlinal divisions (LADs) in the endodermis where it is polarly localized. IRK is closely related to PXY/TDR CORRELATED 2 (PXC2); here, we show that PXC2 exhibits similar polarized accumulation suggesting they have related functions. pxc2 roots have increased stele area and irk pxc2 double mutant roots show increases in stele area and endodermal LADs beyond either single mutant, indicating that polarly localized IRK and PXC2 function redundantly to repress endodermal LADs and stele area. The double mutant also exhibits agravitropic root growth and abnormal cotyledon vein patterning. Manipulation of PIN1 trafficking and (re)localization mechanisms indicate that PXC2 and/or IRK suggest a link to modulation of polar auxin transport. We conclude that IRK and PXC2 have partially redundant functions in the root, but may have independent functions that are tissue-specific. We propose that repression of endodermal LADs and stele area through a PXC2/IRK-mediated, directional signaling pathway is required for normal ground tissue cell divisions, tissue patterning, and growth in Arabidopsis roots.",

    "abstract": "Identifying and characterizing the effect of combination therapies is of paramount importance in various diseases, including cancer. Various competing null models have been proposed to serve as baselines against which to compare the effect of drug combinations. In this work, we introduce Correlated Drug Action (CDA), a baseline model for the study of drug combinations in both cell cultures and in patient populations. CDA assumes that the efficacy of pairs of drugs to be used in a combination may be correlated, that is, if the efficacy of a drug in a given patient or cell is high (low), then the efficacy of the other drug may also be high (low) in the same patient or cell. Our model can be used in the temporal domain (temporal CDA or tCDA) to explain survival curves in patient populations, and in the dose domain (dose CDA or dCDA), to explain dose-response curves in cell cultures. At the level of clinical trials, we demonstrate tCDAs utility in identifying possibly synergistic combinations and cases where the combination can be explained in terms of the monotherapies. At the level of cells in culture, dCDA generalizes null models such as Bliss independence, the Highest Single Agent model, the dose equivalence principle, and is consistent with what should be expected in sham combinations. We demonstrate the applicability of dCDA in assessing combinations in experimental MCF7 cell-line data by introducing a new metric, the Excess over CDA (EOCDA).",

    "abstract": "AbstractWe introduce a deep learning model that predicts super-resolved versions of diffraction-limited microscopy images. Our model, named Task- Assisted Generative Adversarial Network (TA-GAN), incorporates an auxiliary task (e.g. segmentation, localization) closely related to the observed biological nanostructures characterization. We evaluate how TA-GAN improves generative accuracy over unassisted methods using images acquired with different modalities such as confocal, brightfield (diffraction-limited), super-resolved stimulated emission depletion, and structured illumination microscopy. The generated synthetic resolution enhanced images show an accurate distribution of the F-actin nanostructures, replicate the nanoscale synaptic cluster morphology, allow to identify dividing S. aureus bacterial cell boundaries, and localize nanodomains in simulated images of dendritic spines. We expand the applicability of the TA-GAN to different modalities, auxiliary tasks, and online imaging assistance. Incorporated directly into the acquisition pipeline of the microscope, the TA-GAN informs the user on the nanometric content of the field of view without requiring the acquisition of a super-resolved image. This information is used to optimize the acquisition sequence, and reduce light exposure. The TA-GAN also enables the creation of domain-adapted labeled datasets requiring minimal manual annotation, and assists microscopy users by taking online decisions regarding the choice of imaging modality and regions of interest.",

    "abstract": "Linker histones (LH) have been shown to preferentially bind to AT-rich DNA, particularly A-tracts, contiguous stretches of adenines. Using spFRET (single pair Forster/Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer), we recently found that the globular domain (gH) of Xenopus laevis H1.0b LH orients towards A-tracts on the linker-DNA (L-DNA) while binding on-dyad in LH:mononucleosome complexes. Here, we investigate the impact of this A-tract-mediated orientation of the gH on the compaction of higher-order structures by studying trinucleosomes as minimal models for chromatin. Two 600 bp DNA sequences were constructed, each containing three consecutive Widom 601 core sequences connected by about 40 bp L-DNA but differing in the positioning of A-tracts on either the outer or the inner L-DNAs flanking the first and third Widom 601 sequences. The two inner L-DNAs were fluorescently labelled at their midpoints. Trinucleosomes were reconstituted using the doubly labelled DNA, core histone octamers and H1.0b. SpFRET was performed for a range of NaCl concentrations to measure the compaction and whether gH orientations affected the stability of the trinucleosomes to salt-induced dissociation. While the LH compacted the trinucleosomes, the extent of compaction and the stability were similar for the two DNA sequences. Modeling constrained by the measured FRET efficiency suggests that the structures adopted by the trinucleosomes correspond to the standard zig-zagged two-helical start arrangement with the first and third nucleosomes stacked on top of each other. In this arrangement, the first and third LHs are insufficiently close to interact and affect compaction. Thus, despite differences in the positioning of the A-tracts in the sequences studied, LH binding compacts the corresponding trinucleosomes similarly.\n\nWhy it mattersThe compaction and three-dimensional structure of chromatin affect the exposure of the DNA and thus regulate gene expression. Linker histone proteins bind to nucleosomes and thereby contribute to chromatin compaction. We here investigated whether the DNA A-tract-mediated orientation of a linker histone globular domain affects chromatin structure by using a trinucleosome as a minimal model for chromatin. Our observations suggest that the trinucleosome structure and compaction are robust against differences in linker histone globular domain orientations.\n\neTOC blurbWe investigate whether DNA sequences, such as adenine-tracts, and sequence-induced linker histone reorientation affect chromatin structure. Using trinucleosomes as model systems for chromatin, we demonstrate that the chromatin structure and compaction are robust to the studied DNA sequence differences and sequence-induced linker histone orientation.",

    "abstract": "The coordination of activity between brain cells is a key determinant of neural circuit function; nevertheless, approaches that selectively regulate communication between two distinct cellular components of a mammalian circuit remain sparse. To address this gap, we developed a novel class of gap junctions by selectively engineering two connexin proteins found in Morone americana (white perch fish): connexin34.7 (Cx34.7) and connexin35 (Cx35). By iteratively exploiting protein mutagenesis, a novel in vitro assay of connexin docking, and computational modeling of connexin hemichannel interactions, we uncovered a pattern of structural motifs that contribute to hemichannel docking compatibility. Targeting these motifs, we designed Cx34.7 and Cx35 hemichannels that dock with each other, but not with themselves, nor with other major connexins expressed in the mammalian central nervous system. We validated these hemichannels in vivo using C. elegans and mice, demonstrating that they can facilitate communication across neural circuits composed of pairs of distinct cell types and modify behavior accordingly. Thus, we establish a potentially translational approach,  Long-term integration of Circuits using connexins (LinCx), for context-precise circuit-editing with unprecedented spatiotemporal specificity in mammals.",

    "abstract": "MotivationWith the wide availability of single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology, population-scale scRNA-seq datasets across multiple individuals and time points are emerging. Although the immediate analysis of these datasets tend to focus on standard analysis of clustering and differential expression, leveraging the power of scRNA-seq data at the personalized dynamic gene co-expression network-level has the potential to unlock subject and/or time-specific network-level variation critical for phenotypic differences. Community detection from co-expression networks of multiple time points or conditions has been well-studied; however, none of the existing settings included networks from multiple subjects and multiple time points simultaneously. To address this, we develop MuDCoD for multi-subject community detection in personalized dynamic gene networks from single cell RNA sequencing. MuDCoD builds on the spectral clustering framework and promotes information sharing among the subjects networks as well as networks at different time points. It clusters genes in the personalized dynamic gene networks and reveals gene communities that are variable or shared not only across time but also among subjects.\n\nResultsEvaluation and benchmarking of MuDCoD against existing approaches reveal that MuDCoD effectively leverages apparent shared signals among networks of the subjects at individual time points, and performs robustly when there is no or little information sharing among the networks. Applications to population-scale scRNA-seq datasets of human-induced pluripotent stem cells during dopaminergic neuron differentiation and CD4+ T cell activation indicate that MuDCoD enables robust inference for identifying time-varying personalized gene modules. Our results illustrate how personalized dynamic community detection can aid in the exploration of subject-specific biological processes that vary across time.\n\nAvailabilityMuDCoD is publicly available at https://github.com/bo1929/MuDCoD as a Python package.

    "abstract": "Post-translational methylation of proteins, which occurs in arginines and lysines, modulates several biological processes at different levels of cell signaling. Recently, methylation has been demonstrated in the regulation beyond histones, for example, in the dynamics of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. However, the presence and role of non-histone methylation in Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, has not yet been elucidated. Here, we applied mass spectrometry-based-proteomics (LC-MS/MS) to describe the methylproteome of T. cruzi epimastigotes. A total of 1253 methyl sites in 824 methylated proteins were identified, of these, 712 (86.4%) proteins were identified in two or more biological replicates. Our results of functional enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction, and co-occurrence with other PTMs, show that protein methylation impacts different levels of biological processes, such translation, RNA and DNA binding, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. In addition, 171 methylated proteins were previously reported with phosphorylation sites in T. cruzi, including flagellar proteins and RNA binding proteins, indicating that there may be an interplay between these different modifications in non-histone proteins. Our results show that a broad spectrum of functions are affected by methylation indicating its potential to impact important processes in the biology of the parasite and other trypanosomes.\n\nStatement of the significanceTrypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite that causes Chagas disease in humans and faces different environmental changes throughout its life cycle. Protein methylation is an important post-translational modification by which cells respond and adapt to the environment. We applied mass spectrometry-based proteomics and reported the first proteomic analysis of arginine and lysine methylation in T. cruzi. Our data demonstrate that protein methylation is broad and impacts different cellular processes in T. cruzi. This study represents a significant advance in the investigation of the importance of protein methylation in trypanosomes.",

    "abstract": "Human limbs emerge during the fourth post-conception week as mesenchymal buds which develop into fully-formed limbs over the subsequent months. Limb development is orchestrated by numerous temporally and spatially restricted gene expression programmes, making congenital alterations in phenotype common. Decades of work with model organisms has outlined the fundamental processes underlying vertebrate limb development, but an in-depth characterisation of this process in humans has yet to be performed. Here we detail the development of the human embryonic limb across space and time, using both single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. We demonstrate extensive diversification of cells, progressing from a restricted number of multipotent progenitors to myriad mature cell states, and identify several novel cell populations, including neural fibroblasts and multiple distinct mesenchymal states. We uncover two waves of human muscle development, each characterised by different cell states regulated by separate gene expression programmes. We identify musculin (MSC) as a key transcriptional repressor maintaining muscle stem cell identity and validate this by performing MSC knock down in human embryonic myoblasts, which results in significant upregulation of late myogenic genes. Through integration of multiple anatomically continuous spatial transcriptomic samples, we spatially map single-cell clusters across a sagittal section of a whole fetal hindlimb. We reveal a clear anatomical segregation between genes linked to brachydactyly and polysyndactyly, and uncover transcriptionally and spatially distinct populations of mesenchyme in the autopod. Finally, we perform scRNA-seq on murine embryonic limbs to facilitate cross-species developmental comparison at single-cell resolution, finding substantial homology between the two species.",

Here, we explored the role of {Delta}40p53 in regulating the long non-coding RNA-microRNA-cellular process axis, specifically focusing on LINC00176. Interestingly, LINC00176 levels were predominantly affected by the overexpression/stress-mediated induction and knockdown of {Delta}40p53 rather than p53 levels. Additional assays revealed that {Delta}40p53 transactivates LINC00176 transcriptionally and could also regulate its stability. RNA immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that LINC00176 sequesters several putative microRNA targets, which could further titrate several mRNA targets involved in different cellular processes. To understand the downstream effects of this regulation, we ectopically overexpressed and knocked down LINC00176 in HCT116 p53-/- (harboring only {Delta}40p53) cells, which affected their proliferation, cell viability, and expression of epithelial markers.

Here we sought to understand how BCAA catabolism supports intermediary metabolism and function in cultured adipocytes.\n\nMethodsUsing CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing, we generated 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes deficient in either branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase, subunit alpha (Bckdha) or acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 8 (Acad8), which predominantly metabolizes valine-derived isobutyryl-CoA, and examined their metabolism after differentiation. We performed stable-isotope tracing and mass spectrometry, developed a 13C metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) model incorporating central carbon metabolism and lipid biosynthesis, and performed RNA-sequencing to further explore functional changes.\n\nResultsGeneration of polyclonal cultures deficient in Bckdha resulted in a 90%+ decrease in [U-13C6]leucine labeling in citrate in differentiated adipocytes (p<0.001). Lipid droplet accumulation and mRNA levels of key markers of adipocyte differentiation were unaffected by Bckdha deficiency; however, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated adipogenesis and glycolysis were the primary downregulated pathways in these cells. Bckdha-deficient adipocytes had decreased glucose uptake (p<0.05), glycolytic flux (p<0.05), and increased glutamine contribution to the TCA cycle (p<0.05). These findings were supported by reduced lactate secretion (p<0.001) and oxygen consumption rates (p<0.05) and correlated with the transcriptional changes observed in adipocytes. Total de novo fatty acid synthesis flux was maintained but levels of odd-chain fatty acids and branched-chain fatty acids were reduced, as was the C16:1/C16:0 ratio. 13C-MFA confirmed these changes and highlighted the complex relationship between the TCA cycle, BCAA catabolism, and mitochondrial respiration. Finally, Acad8 deficiency resulted in far fewer differentially expressed genes compared to Bckdha deficiency and milder metabolic changes overall.\n\nConclusionsThese findings highlight key metabolic and transcriptional changes that occur due to Bckdha deficiency in adipocytes and identify important links between BCAA catabolism, glycolytic flux, and respiration.\n\nHighlightsO_LIBckdha deficiency reduced glycolysis and lactate secretion in adipocytes\nC_LIO_LIPyruvate and glutamine contribution to TCA metabolism and acetyl-CoA increased\nC_LIO_LIde novo fatty acid synthesis flux was maintained but fatty acid diversity decreased\nC_LIO_LIRNA-seq data highlighted regulation of genes in glycolysis, adipogenesis, and EMT\nC_LIO_LIAcad8 deficiency resulted in fewer altered transcripts and milder metabolic changes\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Voxelwise encoding models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as state-of-the-art predictive models of brain activity evoked by natural movies. Despite their superior predictive performance, the huge number of parameters in CNN-based models have made them difficult to interpret. Here, we investigate whether model compression can build more interpretable and more stable CNN-based voxelwise models while maintaining accuracy. We used multiple compression techniques to prune less important CNN filters and connections, a receptive field compression method to select receptive fields with optimal center and size, and principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality. We demonstrate that the model compression improves the accuracy of identifying visual stimuli in a hold-out test set. Additionally, compressed models offer a more stable interpretation of voxelwise pattern selectivity than uncompressed models. Finally, the receptive field-compressed models reveal that the optimal model-based population receptive fields become larger and more centralized along the ventral visual pathway. Overall, our findings support using model compression to build more interpretable voxelwise models.",

    "abstract": "The hyper diverse orchid genus Bulbophyllum is the second largest genus of flowering plants and exhibits a pantropical distribution with a center of diversity in tropical Asia. The only Bulbophyllum section with a center of diversity in Australasia is sect. Adelopetalum. However, phylogenetic placement, interspecific relationships, and spatio-temporal evolution of the section have remained largely unclear. To infer broad-level relationships within Bulbophyllum and interspecific relationships within sect. Adelopetalum, a genome skimming dataset was generated for 89 samples, yielding 70 plastid coding regions and the nuclear ribosomal DNA cistron. For 18 additional samples, Sanger data from two plastid loci (matK, ycf1) and nuclear ITS were added using a supermatrix approach. The study provided new insights into broad-level relationships in Bulbophyllum, including phylogenetic evidence for the non-monophyly of sections Beccariana, Brachyantha, Brachypus, Cirrhopetaloides, Cirrhopetalum, Desmosanthes, Minutissima, Oxysepala, Polymeres and Sestochilos. Section Adelopetalum and sect. Minutissima s.s. formed a highly supported clade that was resolved in sister group position to the remainder of the genus. Divergence time estimations based on a relaxed molecular clock model placed the origin of Bulbophyllum in the early Oligocene (ca. 33.2 Ma) and of sect. Adelopetalum in the late Oligocene (ca. 23.6 Ma). Ancestral range estimations based on a BAYAREALIKE model identified the Australian continent as ancestral area of sect. Adelopetalum. The section underwent crown diversification during the mid-Miocene to the late Pleistocene, predominantly in continental Australia. At least two independent long-distance dispersal events were inferred eastwards from the Australian continent to New Zealand, and New Caledonia from the early Pliocene onwards, likely mediated by the predominantly westerly winds of the southern hemisphere. Retraction and fragmentation of eastern Australian rainforests from the early Miocene onwards are discussed as likely drivers of lineage divergence within sect. Adelopetalum, facilitating allopatric speciation.",

Yet, we are still missing a mechanistic explanation of the whole brain dynamics underlying these plasticity defining changes.\n\nMethodIn this study, we explored the effect of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over left primary motor cortex (L-M1) on functional connectivity dynamics (FCD) in patients with ET. Resting-state fMRI (RsfMRI) was acquired before and after a single session of rTMS in 30 patients with ET and compared with RsfMRI of 20 age and gender matched healthy controls (HCs).

After a single session rTMS, the brain connectivity measures approached normality and patients with ET revealed significantly higher integration, lower segregation with higher metastability and increased intrinsic ignition.\n\nConclusionBrain metastability and intrinsic ignition measures could be valuable tools in appreciating mechanisms of brain stimulation in ET and other neurological diseases.",

Here, we show that the histone deacetylase, SIRT-1, is essential for autophagy and EV-D68 infection. Knockdown of SIRT-1 inhibits autophagy and reduces EV-D68 extracellular titers. The proviral activity of SIRT-1 does not require its deacetylase activity or functional autophagy. SIRT-1s proviral activity is, we demonstrate, mediated through the repression of ER stress. Inducing ER stress through thapsigargin treatment or SERCA2A knockdown in SIRT-1 knockdown cells had no additional effect on EV-D68 extracellular titers. Knockdown of SIRT-1 also decreases poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2 titers but not coxsackievirus B3. In non-lytic conditions, EV-D68 is primarily released in an enveloped form, and SIRT-1 is required for this process. Our data show that SIRT-1, through its translocation to the cytosol, is critical to promote the release of enveloped EV-D68 viral particles.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that irony is one of the most challenging forms of communication, consequently, it can be a valuable indicator of communication abilities. An ironic statement transmits the opposite meaning of its literal counterpart. The cognitive processes that may support the interpretation of irony include the Theory of Mind (ToM), executive functions, and processing style. The brain areas associated with irony detection are the medial prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), precuneus, and inferior parietal lobule, among others. This study aims to analyze the cognitive processes and neural correlates involved in irony detection in Mexican adults. Forty-five participants underwent a cognitive assessment and performed a contextual discrepancy task during fMRI acquisition. The behavioral results showed that the detection of nonliteral statements (irony, unrelated, and white lies) requires ToM and verbal abilities. In addition, white lies detection seemed to involve inhibitory control. Ironic statements were the hardest intention to detect, having the lowest percentage of classification and the slowest latency of classification. Irony detection involved brain areas associated with the ToM (i.e., precuneus) and language (i.e., IFG and pSTG) as was expected based on the results of previous studies. The detection of literal and unrelated statements recruited motor areas. No differential activation pattern was found for detection of white lies. Finally, a global perceptual processing style predicted the percent change in the BOLD signal in the IFG for all the nonliteral and literal statements.",

Although flexible, CNNs are difficult to interpret. We use Taylor decomposition approaches to understand the discovered model and how it maps task features to activity. We apply MINE to a published cortical dataset as well as experiments designed to probe thermoregulatory circuits in zebrafish. MINE allowed us to characterize neurons according to their receptive field and computational complexity, features which anatomically segregate in the brain. We also identified a new class of neurons that integrate thermosensory and behavioral information which eluded us previously when using traditional clustering and regression-based approaches.",

Xeroderris stuhlmannii (Taub.) Mendonca & E.P. Sousa (X. stuhlmannii (Taub.)) is a medicinal plant used traditionally in Zimbabwe to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications. However, there is no scientific evidence to support its inhibitory effect against digestive enzymes (-glucosidases) that are linked to high blood sugar in humans.\n\nAim of the study: This work aims to investigate whether bioactive phytochemicals of crude X. stuhlmannii (Taub.) can scavenge free radicals and inhibit -glucosidases in order to reduce blood sugar in humans.\n\nMaterials and methodsHere we examined the free radical scavenging potential of crude aqueous, ethyl acetate and methanolic extracts of X. stuhlmannii (Taub.) using the diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl assay in vitro. Furthermore, we carried out in vitro inhibition of -glucosidases (-amylase and -glucosidase) by the crude extracts using chromogenic 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid and p-nitrophenyl--D-glucopyranoside substrates. We also used molecular docking approaches (Autodock Vina) to screen for bioactive phytochemical compounds targeting the digestive enzymes.\n\nResultsOur results showed that phytochemicals in X. stuhlmannii (Taub.) aqueous, ethyl acetate and methanolic extracts scavenged free radicals with IC50 values ranging from 0.002-0.013 g/mL. Furthermore, crude aqueous, ethyl acetate and methanolic extracts significantly inhibited -amylase and -glucosidase with IC50 values of 10.5-29.5 g/mL (versus 54.1{+/-}0.7 g/mL for acarbose) and 8.8-49.5 g/mL (versus 161.4{+/-}1.8 g/mL for acarbose), respectively. In silico molecular docking findings and pharmacokinetic predictions showed that myricetin is likely a novel plant-derived -glucosidase inhibitor.\n\nConclusionCollectively, our findings suggest pharmacological targeting of digestive enzymes by X. stuhlmannii (Taub.) crude extracts may reduce blood sugar in humans with T2DM via inhibition of -glucosidases.",

    "abstract": "NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis (NMDAR-AE) is characterized by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-resident anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies that cause a wide range of neurological manifestations. Although many symptoms are responsive to immunotherapy, behavioral deficits persist, especially in young patients. However, the underlying mechanisms of these long-lasting impairments are unknown. Here, we used a patient-derived GluN1-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) to interrogate the underlying mechanisms of long-lasting sensory-motor impairments. Transient exposure to this mAb led to excess callosal projections in somatosensory cortex and resulted in permanent callosal axon alterations in mice. Importantly, these mice displayed persistent fine movement impairments which were similar to those in NMDAR-AE patients. Notably, the severity of these behavioral deficits was tightly correlated with the severity of callosal axon alterations. At the injection site, the anti-GluN1 autoantibody significantly decreased EPH receptor B2 (EPHB2) expression, a regulator of commissural projections, indicating EPHB2s essential role in this phenotype. Our studies reveal important insights into the cellular and molecular basis for persistent sensory-motor deficits in NMDAR-AE.",

    "abstract": "Human environments comprise various sources of distraction, which often occur unexpectedly in time. The proneness to distraction (i.e., distractibility) is posited to be independent of attentional sampling of targets, but its temporal dynamics and neurobiological basis are largely unknown. Brain oscillations in the theta band (3 - 8 Hz) have been associated with fluctuating neural excitability, which is hypothesised here to explain rhythmic modulation of distractibility. In a pitch discrimination task (N = 30) with unexpected auditory distractors, we show that distractor-evoked neural responses in the electroencephalogram and perceptual susceptibility to distraction were co-modulated and cycled approximately 3 - 5 times per second. Pre-distractor neural phase in left inferior frontal and insular cortex regions explained fluctuating distractibility. Thus, human distractibility is not constant but fluctuates on a subsecond timescale. Furthermore, slow neural oscillations subserve the behavioural consequences of a hitherto largely unexplained but ever-increasing phenomenon in modern environments - distraction by unexpected sound.",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposeLate secondary glaucoma is an often-severe complication after acute events like anterior segment surgery, trauma, infection, etc. TNF- is a major mediator that is rapidly upregulated, diffusing also to the retina and causes apoptosis of the ganglion cells and degeneration of their optic nerve axons (mediating steps to glaucomatous damage). Anti-TNF- antibodies are in animals very effective in protecting the ganglion cells and the optic nerve--and might therefore be useful prophylactically against secondary glaucoma in future such patients. Here we evaluate 1) toxicity and 2) efficacy of two TNF- inhibitors (adalimumab and infliximab), in rabbits by subconjunctival administration.\n\nMethodsFor drug toxicity, animals with normal, unburned corneas were injected with adalimumab (0.4, 4, or 40 mg), or infliximab (1, 10, or 100 mg). For drug efficacy, other animals were subjected to alkali burn before such injection, or steroids (for control). The rabbits were evaluated clinically with slit lamp and photography, electroretinography, optical coherence tomography, and intraocular pressure manometry. A sub-set of eyes were stained ex vivo after 3 days for retinal ganglion cell apoptosis (TUNEL). In other experiments the optic nerves were evaluated by paraphenylenediamine staining after 50 or 90 days. Loss of retinal ganglion cells and optic nerve degeneration were quantified.\n\nResultsSubconjunctival administration of 0.4 mg or 4.0 mg adalimumab were well tolerated, whereas 40.0 mg was toxic to the retina. 1, 10, or 100 mg infliximab were also well tolerated. Analysis of the optic nerve axons after 50 days confirmed the safety of 4.0 mg adalimumab and of 100 mg infliximab.\n\nFor efficacy, 4.0 mg adalimumab subconjunctivally in 0.08 mL provided practically full protection against ganglion cell apoptosis 3 days following alkali burn, and infliximab 100 mg only slightly less. At 90 days following burn injury, control optic nerves showed about 50% axon loss as compared to 8% in the adalimumab treatment group.\n\nConclusionsSubconjunctival injection of 4.0 mg adalimumab in rabbits shows no eye toxicity and provides excellent neuroprotection, both short (3 days) and long-term (90 days). Our total accumulated data from several of our studies, combined with the present paper, suggest that corneal injuries, including surgery, might benefit from routine administration of anti-TNF- biologics to reduce inflammation and future secondary glaucoma.",

    "abstract": "Tumor hypoxia is a major cause of resistance to cancer treatments and especially to radiotherapy (RT) and we wanted to assess whether ultra-high dose rate FLASH RT could overcome this resistance. We engrafted tumor cells of various origins subcutaneously in mice to provide a reliable and rigorous way to modulate oxygen supply via vascular clamping or carbogen breathing. We irradiated tumors using a single 20 Gy fraction at either conventional (CONV) or FLASH dose-rate. Using multiple different subcutaneous tumor models, and in contrast CONV-RT, FLASH-RT retained anti-tumor efficacy under extreme hypoxia. These findings demonstrate that in addition to normal tissue sparing, FLASH-RT overcomes hypoxia-mediated tumor resistance. Follow-up molecular analysis using RNAseq profiling uncovered FLASH-specific inhibition of cell proliferation and translation as well as metabolic shifts that discriminated FLASH-RT from CONV-RT. These data provide new and specific insights into the mechanism of action and identify novel targets for intervention.",

    "abstract": "A model of early auditory processing is proposed in which each peripheral channel is processed by a delay-and-subtract cancellation filter, tuned independently for each channel with a criterion of minimum power. For a channel dominated by a pure tone or a resolved partial of a complex tone, the optimal delay is its period. For a channel responding to harmonically-related partials, the optimal delay is their common fundamental period. Each peripheral channel is thus split into two subchannels, one that is cancellation-filtered and the other not. Perception can involve either or both, depending on the task. The model is illustrated by applying it to the masking asymmetry between pure tones and narrowband noise: a noise target masked by a tone is more easily detectable than a tone target masked by noise. The model is one of a wider class of models, monaural or binaural, that cancel irrelevant stimulus dimensions so as to attain invariance to competing sources. Similar to occlusion in the visual domain, cancellation yields sensory evidence that is incomplete, thus requiring Bayesian inference of an internal model of the world along the lines of Helmholtzs doctrine of unconscious inference.",

    "abstract": "Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and magnitude. Consequently, it is important to understand their effects and remediation. Resilience reflects the ability of an ecosystem to absorb change, which is important for understanding ecological dynamics and trajectories. To describe the impact of a powerful storm on coral reef structural complexity, we used novel computational tools and detailed 3D reconstructions captured at three time points over three years. Our data-set Reefs4D of 21 co-registered image-based models enabled us to calculate the differences at seven sites over time and is released with the paper. We employed six geometrical metrics, two of which are new algorithms for calculating fractal dimension of reefs in full 3D. We conducted a multivariate analysis to reveal which sites were affected the most and their relative recovery. We also explored the changes in fractal dimension per size category using our cube-counting algorithm. Three metrics showed a signicant difference between time points, i.e., decline and subsequent recovery in structural complexity. The multivariate analysis and the results per size category showed a similar trend. Coral reef resilience has been the subject of seminal studies in ecology. We add important information to the discussion by focusing on 3D structure through image-based modeling. The full picture shows resilience in structural complexity, suggesting that the reef has not gone through a catastrophic phase shift. Our novel analysis framework is widely transferable and useful for research, monitoring, and management.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=107 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/519015v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (50K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@888999org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c51dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@340d97org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16865d8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIThe effect of storms on coral reef 3D structure is poorly understood.\nC_LIO_LIWe studied the impact of a storm on coral reefs using a novel 3D imaging framework.\nC_LIO_LIWe used geometrical metrics including new methods for calculating fractal dimension.\nC_LIO_LIThe reefs recovered in two years with regards to structural complexity.\nC_LIO_LIBased on 3D analysis the reefs exhibit structural resilience.\nC_LI",

However, the computational identification of TMs poses challenges due to their convoluted biological functions, poorly-defined molecular features, and varying spatially organized patterns. Here, we present a hypothesis-free graph Fourier transform model, SpaGFT, to represent spatially organized features using the Fourier coefficients, leading to an accurate representation of spatially variable genes and proteins and the characterization of TM at a fast computational speed. We implemented sequencing-based and imaging-based spatial transcriptomics, spatial-CITE-seq, and spatial proteomics to identify spatially variable genes and proteins, define TM identities, and infer convoluted functions among TMs in mouse brains and human lymph nodes. We collected a human tonsil sample and performed CODEX to accurately demonstrate molecular and cellular variability within the secondary follicle structure. The superior accuracy, scalability, and interpretability of SpaGFT indicate that it is an effective representation of spatially-resolved omics data and an essential tool for bringing new insights into molecular tissue biology.",

    "abstract": "Identifying causal relations or causal networks among molecules/genes, rather than just their correlations, is of great importance but challenging in biology and medical field, which is essential for unravelling molecular mechanisms of disease progression and developing effective therapies for disease treatment. However, there is still a lack of high-quality causal inference algorithms for any observed data in contrast to time series data. In this study, we developed a new causal concept for any observed data and its causal inference algorithm built on cross-validated predictability (CVP) can quantify the causal effects among molecules/genes in the whole system. The causality was extensively validated by combining a large variety of statistical simulation experiments and available benchmark data (simulated data and various real data). Combining the predicted causal network and the real benchmark network, the CVP algorithm demonstrates high accuracy and strong robustness in comparison with the mainstream algorithms. In particular, the CVP algorithm is robust in identifying reliable driver genes and network biomarkers from the perspective of network biology, with the prediction results outperforming the mainstream conventional methods for predicting driver genes. CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown experiments in the liver cancer have validated that the functional driver genes identified by the CVP algorithm effectively inhibit the growth and colony formation of liver cancer cells. By knockdown experiments, we demonstrated the accuracy and significance of the causality predicted by CVP and identified the novel regulatory targets of functional driver genes SNRNP200 and RALGAPB in the liver cancer. These inferred causal networks explain regulatory patterns in different biological contexts in a clear sense and provide biological insights into molecular mechanisms of disease progression from a causality perspective.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes in the lamina region of the optic nerve head play vital roles in supporting retinal ganglion cell axon health. In glaucoma, these astrocytes are implicated as early responders to stressors, undergoing characteristic changes in cell function as well as cell morphology. Much of what is currently known about individual lamina astrocyte morphology has been learned from rodent models which lack a defining feature of the human optic nerve head, the collagenous lamina cribrosa (LC). Current methods available for evaluation of collagenous LC astrocyte morphology have significant shortcomings. We aimed to evaluate Multicolor DiOlistic labeling (MuDi) as an approach to reveal individual astrocyte morphologies across the collagenous LC.\n\nGold microcarriers were coated with all combinations of three fluorescent cell membrane dyes, DiI, DiD, and DiO, for a total of seven dye combinations. Microcarriers were delivered to 150m-thick coronal vibratome slices through the LC of pig, sheep, goat, and monkey eyes via MuDi. Labeled tissues were imaged with confocal and second harmonic generation microscopy to visualize dyed cells and LC collagenous beams, respectively. GFAP labeling of DiOlistically-labeled cells with astrocyte morphologies was used to investigate cell identity. 3D models of astrocytes were created from confocal image stacks for quantification of morphological features.\n\nDiOlistic labeling revealed fine details of LC astrocyte morphologies including somas, primary branches, higher-order branches, and end-feet. Labeled cells with astrocyte morphologies were GFAP+. Astrocytes were visible across seven distinct color channels, allowing high labeling density while still distinguishing individual cells from their neighbors. MuDi was capable of revealing tens to hundreds of collagenous LC astrocytes, in situ, with a single application. 3D astrocyte models allowed automated quantification of morphological features including branch number, length, thickness, hierarchy, and straightness as well as Sholl analysis.\n\nMuDi labeling provides an opportunity to investigate morphologies of collagenous LC astrocytes, providing both qualitative and quantitative detail, in healthy tissues. This approach may open doors for research of glaucoma, where astrocyte morphological alterations are thought to coincide with key functional changes related to disease progression.",

    "abstract": "The opportunistic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses the LasR-I quorum sensing system to increase resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic tobramycin. Paradoxically, lasR-null mutants are commonly isolated from chronic human infections treated with tobramycin, suggesting there may be a mechanism allowing the lasR-null mutants to persist under tobramycin selection. We hypothesized that the effects of inactivating lasR on tobramycin resistance might be dependent on the presence or absence of other gene mutations in that strain, a phenomenon known as epistasis. To test this hypothesis, we inactivated lasR in several highly tobramycin-resistant isolates from long-term evolution experiments. We show that the effects of {Delta}lasR on tobramycin resistance are strain dependent, which is due to a single mutation in the fusA1 gene encoding the translation elongation factor EF-G1A (G61A nucleotide substitution). The fusA1 G61A mutation confers a strong selective advantage to {Delta}lasR mutants under tobramycin treatment. The effects of fusA1 G61A on {Delta}lasR-dependent tobramycin resistance are dependent on the MexXY efflux pump and the MexXY regulator ArmZ. The fusA1 mutation also modulates {Delta}lasR mutant resistance to two other antibiotics, ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. Our results provide a possible explanation for the emergence of lasR-null mutants in clinical isolates and illustrate the importance of epistatic gene interactions in the evolution of quorum sensing.",

The possible mechanism of Sch protective effects against DN was predicted using network pharmacology and was verified by quantitative proteomics analysis.\n\nResultsHigh dose Sch treatment significantly downregulated fasting blood glucose, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and urinary protein levels and reduced collagen deposition in the glomeruli and tubule-interstitium of DN rats. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and plasma glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the kidney of DN rats significantly increased with Sch treatment. In addition, the levels of IL-6, IL-1{beta}, and TNF- were significantly reduced in DN rats treated with Sch. 11 proteins that target both Sch and DN were enriched in pathways such as MAPK signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling, renal cell carcinoma, gap junction, endocrine resistance, and TNF signaling. Furthermore, quantitative proteomics showed that Xaf1 was downregulated in the model vs. control group and upregulated in the Sch-treated vs. model group. Five proteins, Crb3, Tspan4, Wdr45, Zfp512, and Tmigd1, were found to be upregulated in the model vs. control group and downregulated in the Sch vs. model group. Three intersected proteins between the network pharmacology prediction and proteomics results, Crb3, Xaf1, and Tspan4, were identified.\n\nConclusionSch functions by relieving oxidative stress and the inflammatory response by regulating Crb3, Xaf1, and Tspan4 protein expression levels to treat DN disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNormative modeling is a statistical approach to quantify the degree to which a particular individual-level measure deviates from the pattern observed in a normative reference population. When applied to human brain morphometric measures it has the potential to inform about the significance of normative deviations for health and disease. Normative models can be implemented using a variety of algorithms that have not been systematically appraised.\n\nMethodsTo address this gap, eight algorithms were compared in terms of performance and computational efficiency using brain regional morphometric data from 37,407 healthy individuals (53% female; aged 3-90 years) collated from 87 international MRI datasets. Performance was assessed with the mean absolute error (MAE) and computational efficiency was inferred from central processing unit (CPU) time. The algorithms evaluated were Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLSR), Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR), Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS), Parametric Lambda, Mu, Sigma (LMS), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Warped Bayesian Linear Regression (WBLG), Hierarchical Bayesian Regression (HBR), and Multivariable Fractional Polynomial Regression (MFPR). Model optimization involved testing nine covariate combinations pertaining to acquisition features, parcellation software versions, and global neuroimaging measures (i.e., total intracranial volume, mean cortical thickness, and mean cortical surface area).\n\nFindingsStatistical comparisons across models at PFDR<0{middle dot}05 indicated that the MFPR-derived sex- and region-specific models with nonlinear polynomials for age and linear effects of global measures had superior predictive accuracy; the range of the MAE of the models of regional subcortical volumes was 70-520 mm3 and the corresponding ranges for regional cortical thickness and regional cortical surface area were 0{middle dot}09-0{middle dot}26 mm and 24-560 mm2, respectively. The MFPR-derived models were also computationally more efficient with a CPU time below one second compared to a range of 2 seconds to 60 minutes for the other algorithms. The performance of all sex- and region-specific MFPR models plateaued at sample sizes exceeding 3,000 and showed comparable MAEs across distinct 10-year age-bins covering the human lifespan.\n\nInterpretationThese results provide an empirically benchmarked framework for normative modeling of brain morphometry that is useful for interpreting prior literature and supporting future study designs.

We searched electronic databases for articles published in English between Jan 1, 2018, and Jan 31, 2023, using combinations of words or terms that included \"normative modeling\", OR \"growth curves\" OR \"centile curves\" AND terms referring to specific morphometric features. Although multiple studies employed normative models of brain morphometry, we identified a critical knowledge gap in the paucity of benchmarking statistical methods and sensitivity testing for key parameters that may influence model performance.\n\nAdded value of this studyThis study leveraged a large and international sample of healthy individuals (N=37,407) covering the human lifespan to benchmark eight statistical algorithms for normative modeling of brain morphometric measures. In addition to identifying the optimal algorithm, it also defined those parameters pertaining to image acquisition, sample composition, and size that are essential for robust modeling.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThis study provides guidance for the evaluation of prior literature and for the design of future studies. In the context of open and inclusive science, the scripts and model parameters developed are freely available through a web platform with minimal requirements in terms of computational infrastructure and user skills.",

    "abstract": "Appendiceal adenocarcinomas (AAs) are a rare and heterogeneous mix of tumors for which few preclinical models exist. The rarity of AA has made performing prospective clinical trials difficult, and in part because of this AA remains an orphan disease with no chemotherapeutic agents approved by the FDA for its treatment. AA has a unique biology in which it frequently forms diffuse peritoneal metastases, but almost never spreads via a hematogenous route and rarely spreads to lymphatics. Given its localization to the peritoneal space we hypothesized that intraperitoneal (IP) delivery of chemotherapy could be an effective treatment strategy. Here we tested the efficacy paclitaxel given by IP administration using three orthotopic PDX models of AA established in NSG mice. Weekly treatment of 25.0 mg/kg of IP paclitaxel dramatically reduced AA tumor growth in TM00351 (81.9% reduction vs. control), PMP-2 (98.3% reduction vs. control), and PMCA-3 (71.4% reduction vs. control) PDX models. Comparing the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) to IP administration in PMCA-3, neither 6.25 nor 12.5 mg/kg of IV paclitaxel significantly reduced tumor growth. These results suggest that IP administration of paclitaxel is favorable to IV administration. Given the established safety record of IP paclitaxel in gastric and ovarian cancers, and lack of effective chemotherapeutics for AA, these data showing the activity of IP paclitaxel in orthotopic PDX models of mucinous AA support the evaluation of IP paclitaxel in a prospective clinical trial.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine in the nucleus accumbens helps motivate behavior based on expectations of future reward (\"values\"). These values need to be updated by experience: after receiving reward, the choices that led to reward should be assigned greater value. There are multiple theoretical proposals for how this credit assignment could be achieved, but the specific algorithms that generate updated dopamine signals remain uncertain. We monitored accumbens dopamine as freely behaving rats foraged for rewards in a complex, changing environment. We observed brief pulses of dopamine both when rats received reward (scaling with prediction error), and when they encountered novel path opportunities. Furthermore, dopamine ramped up as rats ran towards reward ports, in proportion to the value at each location. By examining the evolution of these dopamine place-value signals, we found evidence for two distinct update processes: progressive propagation along taken paths, as in temporal-difference learning, and inference of value throughout the maze, using internal models. Our results demonstrate that within rich, naturalistic environments dopamine conveys place values that are updated via multiple, complementary learning algorithms.",

The Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) is the largest compendium of whole-genome CRISPR screens aimed at identifying cancer-specific genetic dependencies across human cell lines. A mitochondria-associated bias has been previously reported to mask signals for genes involved in other functions, and thus, methods for normalizing this dominant signal to improve co-essentiality networks are of interest. In this study, we explore three unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods - autoencoders, robust, and classical principal component analyses (PCA) - for normalizing the DepMap to improve functional networks extracted from these data. We propose a novel \"onion\" normalization technique to combine several normalized data layers into a single network. Benchmarking analyses reveal that robust PCA combined with onion normalization outperforms existing methods for normalizing the DepMap. Our work demonstrates the value of removing low-dimensional signals from the DepMap before constructing functional gene networks and provides generalizable dimensionality reduction-based normalization tools.",

    "abstract": "Osteocytes are the resident mechanosensory cells in bone. They are responsible for skeletal homeostasis and adaptation to mechanical cues. Integrin proteins play an prominent role in osteocyte mechanotransduction, however the details are not well stratified in vivo. Intravital imaging with multiphoton microscopy presents an opportunity to study molecular level mechanobiological events in vivo, and could be used to study integrin dynamics in osteocytes. However, fluorescent imaging limitations with respect to excessive optical scattering and low signal to noise ratio caused by mineralized bone matrix make such investigations non-trivial. Here we demonstrate that ultra-small and bright fluorescent core-shell silica nanoparticles (<7nm diameter), known as Cornell Prime Dots (CDots), are well-suited for the in vivo bone microenvironment and can improve intravital imaging capabilities. We report validation studies for CDots as a novel, locally injected in vivo osteocyte imaging tool for both non-specific cellular uptake and for targeting integrins. The pharmacokinetics of CDots reveal distinct sex differences in nanoparticle cycling and clearance in osteocytes, which represents a novel topic of study in bone biology. Integrin-targeted CDots were used to study osteocyte integrin dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, we report here the first evidence of osteocyte integrin endocytosis and recycling in vivo. Our results provide novel insights in osteocyte biology and will open up new lines of investigation that were previously unavailable in vivo.",

Here, we show that conventional culture media volumes dramatically impact O2 availability, limiting oxidative metabolism. We suggest optimal conditions to ensure cultured RPE is in a normoxic environment permissive to oxidative metabolism.\n\nMethodsWe altered the availability of O2 to human primary RPE cultures directly via a hypoxia chamber or indirectly via the amount of medium over cells. We measured oxygen consumption rates (OCR), glucose consumption, lactate production, 13C6-glucose flux, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1) stability, intracellular lipid droplets after a lipid challenge, trans-epithelial electrical resistance, cell morphology, and pigmentation.\n\nResultsMedium volumes commonly employed during RPE culture limit diffusion of O2 to cells, triggering hypoxia, activating HIF-1, limiting OCR, and dramatically altering cell metabolism, with only minor effects on typical markers of RPE health. Media volume effects on O2 availability decrease acetyl-CoA utilization, increase glycolysis, and alter the size and number of intracellular lipid droplets under lipid-rich conditions.\n\nConclusionsDespite having little impact on visible and typical markers of RPE culture health, media volume dramatically affects RPE physiology \"under the hood\". As RPE-centric diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD) involve oxidative metabolism, RPE cultures need to be optimized to study such diseases. We provide guidelines for optimal RPE culture volumes that balance ample nutrient availability from larger media volumes with adequate O2 availability seen with smaller media volumes.",

    "abstract": "The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) is incorporated into virions at the site of particle assembly on the plasma membrane (PM). The route taken by Env to reach the site of assembly and particle incorporation remains incompletely understood. Following initial delivery to the PM through the secretory pathway, Env is rapidly endocytosed, suggesting that recycling is required for particle incorporation. Endosomes marked by the small GTPase Rab14 have been previously shown to play a role in Env trafficking. Here we examined the role of KIF16B, the molecular motor protein that directs outward movement of Rab14-dependent cargo, in Env trafficking. Env colocalized extensively with KIF16B+ endosomes at the cellular periphery, while expression of a motor-deficient mutant of KIF16B redistributed Env to a perinuclear location. The half-life of Env labeled at the cell surface was markedly reduced in the absence of KIF16B, while a normal half-life was restored through inhibition of lysosomal degradation. In the absence of KIF16B, Env expression on the surface of cells was reduced, leading to a reduction in Env incorporation into particles and a corresponding reduction in particle infectivity. HIV-1 replication in KIF16B knockout cells was substantially reduced as compared to wildtype cells. These results indicate that KIF16B regulates an outward sorting step involved in Env trafficking, thereby limiting lysosomal degradation and enhancing particle incorporation.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein is an essential component of HIV-1 particles. The cellular pathways that contribute to incorporation of envelope into particles are not fully understood. Here we identify KIF16B, a motor protein that directs movement from internal compartments toward the plasma membrane, as a host factor that prevents envelope degradation and enhances particle incorporation. This is the first host motor protein identified that contributes to HIV-1 envelope incorporation and replication.",

Distinct organic and organo-mineral layers were identified in the forest and pasture floors, including the litter, partially and wholly decomposed organic material, and the mineral and rhizospheric soils. DNA was extracted, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR were performed to assess bacterial community structure and the abundance of critical groups of the N cycle. We observed a clear vertical gradient in bacterial community composition. Species followed a log-normal distribution, with the highest richness and diversity observed in transitional organic layers of both land uses. Generally, critical groups of the N cycle were more abundant in these transitional layers, especially in the pastures fragmented litter and in the forests partially decomposed organic material. Considering the organic layers increased diversity estimates significantly, with the highest alpha and gamma bacterial diversity observed on the pasture floor and the highest beta diversity on the forest floor. The results show that organic layers harbor significant bacterial diversity in natural and anthropized systems and suggest that they can be crucial for maintaining the N cycle in these ecosystems, highlighting the need to consider them when studying soil bacterial diversity.",

    "abstract": "C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), also known as DNA damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3), is a member of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family. The expression of CHOP is upregulated during unfolded protein response (UPR), and sustained CHOP activity plays an important role in UPR-induced apoptosis. MicroRNA-616 is localized in an intron of the CHOP gene. However, regulation of miR-616 expression during UPR and its function in breast cancer is not clearly understood. We show that miR-5p/-3p arms of miR-616 are expressed with levels of 5p arm higher than 3p arm. During conditions of UPR, the expression of miR-5p and miR-3p arms of miR-616 and its host gene (CHOP) was concordantly increased primarily in a PERK-dependent manner. We show that ectopic expression of miR-616 significantly suppressed cell growth and colony formation, whereas knockout of miR-616 increased it. We identified that MYC proto-oncogene (c-MYC) gene is repressed during the UPR and targeted by miR-616. Further, we show that expression of miR-616 and CHOP is downregulated in human breast cancer, where expression of miR-616 was associated with poor overall survival (OS) in luminal A subtype and better OS HER2 subtype of breast cancer. In summary, our results suggest a dual function for the DDIT3 locus, where CHOP protein and miR-616 can co-operate to regulate cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "Homeostatic plasticity represents a set of mechanisms that are thought to recover some aspect of neural function. One such mechanism called AMPAergic scaling was thought to be a likely candidate to homeostatically control spiking activity. However, recent findings have forced us to reconsider this idea as several studies suggest AMPAergic scaling is not directly triggered by changes in spiking. Moreover, studies examining homeostatic perturbations in vivo have suggested that GABAergic synapses may be more critical in terms of spiking homeostasis. Here we show results that GABAergic scaling can act to homeostatically control spiking levels. We find that increased or decreased spiking in cortical cultures triggers multiplicative GABAergic upscaling and downscaling, respectively. In contrast, we find that changes in AMPAR or GABAR transmission only influence GABAergic scaling through their indirect effect on spiking. We propose that GABAergic scaling, rather than glutamatergic scaling, is a key player in spike rate homeostasis.\n\nSignificance StatementThe nervous system maintains excitability in order to perform network behaviors when called upon to do so. Networks are thought to maintain spiking levels through homeostatic synaptic scaling, where compensatory multiplicative changes in synaptic strength are observed following alterations in cellular spike rate. Although we demonstrated that AMPAergic synaptic scaling does not appear meet these criteria as a spike rate homeostat, we now show that GABAergic scaling does. Here we present evidence that the characteristics of GABAergic scaling place it in an excellent position to be a spiking homeostat. This work highlights the importance of inhibitory circuitry in the homeostatic control of excitability. Further, it provides a point of focus into neurodevelopmental disorders where excitability is impaired.",

However, neural interfaces based on rigid electronics often suffer from recording instability due to the foreign body responses caused by their mechanical mismatch with soft tissues, limiting the longitudinal accuracy of neural decoding methods. Herein, it is reported that flexible electronics can be integrated with machine learning algorithms to achieve long-term reliable neural decoding. Wet-spun conductive polymer microfibers showed mechanical robustness and flexibility, low impedance, and chronic biocompatibility, enabling intracerebral neural recordings in epileptic mice at a high signal-to-noise ratio eight weeks after implantation. When the signals recorded by the flexible electrodes were used in machine learning analyses with diverse complex algorithms, they consistently showed higher prediction accuracy for epileptic seizures than stiff metal electrode signals, particularly in the case of using long-term recordings for testing or small-sample datasets for training. A real-time warning system based on the flexible neural electrodes was built that predicted seizures eight minutes in advance with a low false alarm rate.

    "abstract": "Modulation of odorant receptors mRNA induced by prolonged odor exposure is highly correlated with ligand-receptor interactions in Drosophila as well as mammals of the Muridae family. If this response feature is conserved in other organisms, this presents a potentially potent initial screening tool when searching for novel receptor-ligand interactions in species with predominantly orphan olfactory receptors. We demonstrate that mRNA modulation in response to 1-octen-3-ol odor exposure occurs in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. To investigate gene expression patterns at a global level, we generated an odor-evoked transcriptome associated with 1-octen-3-ol odor exposure. Transcriptomic data revealed that ORs and OBPs were transcriptionally responsive whereas other chemosensory gene families showed little to no differential expression. Alongside chemosensory gene expression changes, transcriptomic analysis found that prolonged exposure to 1-octen-3-ol modulated xenobiotic response genes, primarily members of the cytochrome P450, insect cuticle proteins, and glucuronosyltransferases families. Together, these findings suggest that mRNA transcriptional modulation caused by prolonged odor exposure is pervasive across taxa and accompanied by the activation of xenobiotic responses. Furthermore, odor-evoked transcriptomics create a potential screening tool for filtering and identification of chemosensory and xenobiotic targets of interest.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD), which is linked to reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, and neurotoxicity. Emerging evidence suggests a role of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), a major source of antioxidant response elements in AD. The molecular mechanism of oxidative stress and ferroptosis in astrocytes in AD is not yet fully understood. Here, we aim to investigate the mechanism by which Nrf2 regulates the ferroptosis of astrocytes in AD. Postmortem frontal cortex tissues from patients with AD and nondemented controls and brain tissue from the 3xTg AD mouse model and wild-type mice (10 months old) were used. Immunofluorescence staining for Nrf2, the ROS marker NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), and GFAP was performed. We further induced Nrf2 deficiency in mouse astrocytes by using RNAi and assessed the changes in ROS, ferroptosis, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial dysfunction by using western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. We found decreased expression of Nrf2 and upregulated expression of NOX4 in the frontal cortex from patients with AD and in the cortex of 3xTg mice compared to control mice. We demonstrated that Nrf2 deficiency led to ferroptosis-dependent oxidative stress-induced ROS with downregulated heme oxygenase-1 and glutathione peroxidase 4 and upregulated cystine glutamate expression. Moreover, Nrf2 deficiency increased lipid peroxidation, DNA oxidation, and mitochondrial fragmentation in mouse astrocytes. In conclusion, these results suggest that Nrf2 promotes ferroptosis of astrocytes involving oxidative stress in AD.",

    "abstract": "Driven by the development and upscaling of fast genome sequencing and assembly pipelines, the number of protein-coding sequences deposited in public protein sequence databases is increasing exponentially. Recently, the dramatic success of deep learning-based approaches applied to protein structure prediction has done the same for protein structures. We are now entering a new era in protein sequence and structure annotation, with hundreds of millions of predicted protein structures made available through the AlphaFold database. These models cover most of the catalogued natural proteins, including those difficult to annotate for function or putative biological role based on standard, homology-based approaches. In this work, we quantified how much of such \"dark matter\" of the natural protein universe was structurally illuminated by AlphaFold2 and modelled this diversity as an interactive sequence similarity network that can be navigated at https://uniprot3d.org/atlas/AFDB90v4. In the process, we discovered multiple novel protein families by searching for novelties from sequence, structure, and semantic perspectives. We added a number of them to Pfam, and experimentally demonstrate that one of these belongs to a novel superfamily of translation-targeting toxin-antitoxin systems, TumE-TumA. This work highlights the role of large-scale, evolution-driven protein comparison efforts in combination with structural similarities, genomic context conservation, and deep-learning based function prediction tools for the identification of novel protein families, aiding not only annotation and classification efforts but also the curation and prioritisation of target proteins for experimental characterisation.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis is a global concern due to its high prevalence in developing countries and the ability of mycobacteria to develop resistance to current treatment regimens. In this project, we propose the use of QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships) modeling as a means to identify and evaluate the inhibitory activity of candidate molecules for molecular improvement stages and/or in vitro assays. This approach allows for in silico estimation, reducing research time and costs. To achieve this, we utilized the SAR (Structure-Activity Relationships) study conducted by He, Alian, and Montellano (2007), which focused on a series of arylamides tested as inhibitors of the enzyme enoyl-ACP-reductase (InhA) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We developed both the Hansh-Fujita (classical) and CoMFA (Comparative Molecular Field Analysis) QSAR models. The classical QSAR model produced the most favorable statistical results using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). It achieved an internal validation correlation factor R2 of 0.9012 and demonstrated predictive quality with a Stone-Geisser indicator Q2 of 0.8612. External validation resulted in a correlation factor R2 of 0.9298 and Q2 of 0.720, indicating a highly predictive mathematical model. The CoMFA Model obtained a Q2 of 0.6520 in internal validation, enabling the estimation of energy fields around the molecules. This information is crucial for molecular improvement efforts. We constructed a library of small molecules, analogous to those used in the SAR study, and subjected them to the classic QSAR function. As a result, we identified ten molecules with high estimated biological activity. Molecular docking analysis suggests that these ten analogs, identified by the classical QSAR model, exhibit favorable estimated free energy of binding. In conclusion, the QSAR methodology proves to be an efficient and effective tool for searching and identifying promising drug-like molecules.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo develop a clinically feasible and practical therapy for multi-ocular protection following ocular injury by using a thermosensitive drug delivery system (DDS) for sustained delivery of TNF- and VEGF inhibitors to the eye.\n\nMethodsA thermosensitive, biodegradable hydrogel DDS (PLGA-PEG-PLGA triblock polymer) loaded with 0.7mg of adalimumab and 1.4 mg of aflibercept was injected subconjunctivally in Dutch-belted pigmented rabbits after corneal alkali injury. The polymer was tuned to transition from liquid to gel upon contact with body temperature without need of a catalyst. Control rabbits received 2mg of IgG loaded DDS or 1.4mg aflibercept loaded DDS. Animals were followed for 3 months and assessed for tolerability and prevention of corneal neovascularization (NV), improvement of corneal re-epithelialization, inhibition of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) and optic nerve axon loss, and inhibition of immune cell infiltration into the cornea. Drug release kinetics was assessed in vivo using aqueous humor protein analysis.\n\nResultsA single subconjunctival administration of dual anti-TNF/anti-VEGF DDS achieved sustained 3-month delivery of antibodies to the anterior chamber, iris, ciliary body, and retina. Administration after corneal alkali burn suppressed CD45+ immune cell infiltration into the cornea, completely inhibited cornea NV for 3 months, accelerated corneal re-epithelialization and wound healing, and prevented RGC and optic nerve axon loss at 3 months. In contrast, anti-VEGF alone or IgG DDS treatment led to persistent corneal epithelial defect, increased infiltration of CD45+ immune cells into the cornea, and significant loss of RGCs and optic nerve axons at 3 months. Aqueous humor protein analysis showed first-order release kinetics without adverse effects at the injection site.\n\nConclusionSustained concomitant inhibition of TNF- and VEGF using a biodegradable, slow-release thermosensitive DDS provides significant ocular protection and prevents corneal neovascularization and irreversible damage to retina and optic nerve after corneal alkali injury. This therapeutic approach has the potential to dramatically improve the outcomes of severe ocular injuries in patients.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisomes play a central role in tuning metabolic and signaling programs in a tissue- and cell type-specific manner. However, the mechanisms by which the status of peroxisomes is communicated and integrated into cellular signaling pathways is not yet understood. Herein, we report the cellular responses to acute peroxisomal proteotoxic stress upon silencing the peroxisomal protease/chaperone LONP2. Depletion of LONP2 triggered accumulation of its substrates, alterations in peroxisome size and numbers, and luminal protein import failure. Gene expression changes and lipidomic analysis revealed striking cell specific differences in the response to siLONP2. Specific to COS-7 cells was a strong activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) and upregulation of ribosomal biogenesis gene expression levels. Common changes between COS-7 and U2OS cell lines included repression of the retinoic acid signaling pathway, and upregulation of sphingolipids. Cholesterol accumulated in the endomembrane compartments in both cell lines, consistent with evidence that peroxisomes are required for cholesterol flux out of late endosomes. These unexpected consequences of peroxisomal stress provide an important insight for our understanding of the tissue-specific responses seen in peroxisomal disorders.",

Based on ADDomer, a self-assembling protein nanoparticle scaffold, we created ADDoCoV, a thermostable COVID-19 candidate vaccine displaying multiple copies of a SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding motif (RBM)-derived epitope. In vitro generated neutralising nanobodies combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) established authenticity and accessibility of the epitopes displayed. A Gigabody comprising multimerized nanobodies prevented SARS-CoV-2 virion attachment with picomolar EC50. Antibodies generated by immunising mice cross-reacted with VOCs including Delta and Omicron.

    "abstract": "The acquisition of the post-mitotic state is crucial for the execution of many terminally differentiated cell behaviors during organismal development. However, the mechanisms that maintain the post-mitotic state in this context remain poorly understood. To gain insight into these mechanisms, we used the genetically and visually accessible model of C. elegans anchor cell (AC) invasion into the vulval epithelium. The AC is a terminally differentiated uterine cell that must exit the cell cycle and enter a post-mitotic to initiate contact between the uterus and vulva through a cell invasion event. Here, we set out to identify the negative cell cycle regulators that maintain the AC in a post-mitotic, invasive state. Although our findings revealed a critical role for CKI-1 (p21CIP1/p27KIP1) in maintaining the post-mitotic state of the AC, loss of CKI-1 alone or in combination with other negative cell cycle regulators--including CKI-2 (p21CIP1/p27KIP1), LIN-35 (pRb/p107/p130), FZR-1 (Cdh1/Hct1), and LIN-23 ({beta}-TrCP)--resulted in proliferating ACs that retained their invasive abilities. Upon examination of the gene regulatory network controlling AC invasion, we determined that proliferating, invasive ACs maintain pro-invasive gene expression. We therefore report that maintenance of the post-mitotic state is not necessary for AC invasion, breaking the previously established C. elegans invasion/proliferation dichotomy.",

    "abstract": "During early development, myosin II mechanically reshapes and folds embryo tissue. A much-studied example is ventral furrow formation in Drosophila, marking the onset of gastrulation. Furrowing is driven by contraction of actomyosin networks on apical cell surfaces, but how the myosin patterning encodes tissue shape is unclear, and elastic models failed to reproduce essential features of experimental cell contraction profiles. The myosin patterning exhibits substantial cell-to-cell fluctuations with pulsatile time-dependence, a striking but unexplained feature of morphogenesis in many organisms. Here, using biophysical modeling we find viscous forces offer the principle resistance to actomyosin-driven apical constriction. In consequence, tissue shape is encoded in the direction-dependent curvature of the myosin patterning which orients an anterior-posterior furrow. Tissue contraction is highly sensitive to cell-to-cell myosin fluctuations, explaining furrowing failure in genetically perturbed embryos whose fluctuations are temporally persistent. In wild-type embryos, this catastrophic outcome is averted by pulsatile myosin time-dependence, a time-averaging effect that rescues furrowing. This low pass filter mechanism may underlie the usage of actomyosin pulsing in diverse morphogenetic processes across many organisms.",

    "abstract": "The intricate regulation of chromatin plays a key role in controlling genome architecture and accessibility. Histone lysine methyltransferases regulate chromatin by catalyzing the methylation of specific histone residues but are also hypothesized to have equally important non-catalytic roles. SUV420H1 di- and tri-methylates histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me2/me3) and plays crucial roles in DNA replication, repair, and heterochromatin formation, and is dysregulated in several cancers. Many of these processes were linked to its catalytic activity. However, deletion and inhibition of SUV420H1 have shown distinct phenotypes suggesting the enzyme likely has uncharacterized non-catalytic activities. To characterize the catalytic and non-catalytic mechanisms SUV420H1 uses to modify chromatin, we determined cryo- EM structures of SUV420H1 complexes with nucleosomes containing histone H2A or its variant H2A.Z. Our structural, biochemical, biophysical, and cellular analyses reveal how both SUV420H1 recognizes its substrate and H2A.Z stimulates its activity, and show that SUV420H1 binding to nucleosomes causes a dramatic detachment of nucleosomal DNA from histone octamer. We hypothesize that this detachment increases DNA accessibility to large macromolecular complexes, a prerequisite for DNA replication and repair. We also show that SUV420H1 can promote chromatin condensates, another non-catalytic role that we speculate is needed for its heterochromatin functions. Together, our studies uncover and characterize the catalytic and non-catalytic mechanisms of SUV420H1, a key histone methyltransferase that plays an essential role in genomic stability.",

    "abstract": "Tauopathy, including Alzheimer Disease (AD), is characterized by Tau protein accumulation and autophagy dysregulation. Emerging evidence connects polyamine metabolism with the autophagy pathway, however the role of polyamines in Tauopathy remains unclear. In the present study we investigated the role of spermine synthase (SMS) in autophagy regulation and tau protein processing in Drosophila and human cellular models of Tauopathy. Our previous study showed that Drosophila spermine synthase (dSms) deficiency impairs lysosomal function and blocks autophagy flux. Interestingly, partial loss-of-function of SMS in heterozygous dSms flies extends lifespan and improves the climbing performance of flies with human Tau (hTau) overexpression. Mechanistic analysis showed that heterozygous loss-of-function mutation of dSms reduces hTau protein accumulation through enhancing autophagic flux. Measurement of polyamine levels detected a mild elevation of spermidine in flies with heterozygous loss of dSms. SMS knock-down in human neuronal or glial cells also upregulates autophagic flux and reduces Tau protein accumulation. Proteomics analysis of postmortem brain tissue from AD patients showed a significant albeit modest elevation of SMS protein level in AD-relevant brain regions compared to that of control brains consistently across several datasets. Taken together, our study uncovers a correlation between SMS protein level and AD pathogenesis and reveals that SMS reduction upregulates autophagy, promotes Tau clearance, and reduces Tau protein accumulation. These findings provide a new potential therapeutic target of Tauopathy.",

    "abstract": "Each glia interacts with multiple neurons, but the fundamental logic of whether it interacts with all equally remains unclear. We find that a single sense-organ glia modulates different contacting neurons distinctly. To do so, it partitions regulatory cues into molecular microdomains at specific neuron contact-sites, at its delimited apical membrane. For one glial cue, K/Cl transporter KCC-3, microdomain-localization occurs through a two-step, neuron-dependent process. First, KCC-3 shuttles to glial apical membranes. Second, some contacting neuron cilia repel it, rendering it microdomain-localized around one distal neuron-ending. KCC-3 localization tracks animal aging, and while apical localization is sufficient for contacting neuron function, microdomain-restriction is required for distal neuron properties. Finally, we find the glia regulates its microdomains largely independently. Together, this uncovers that glia modulate cross-modal sensor processing by compartmentalizing regulatory cues into microdomains. Glia across species contact multiple neurons and localize disease-relevant cues like KCC-3. Thus, analogous compartmentalization may broadly drive how glia regulate information processing across neural circuits.",

    "abstract": "Alamar Blue (AB) has become an increasingly popular reagent of choice for cell viability assays. We chose AB over other reagents such as MTT and Cell-Titer Glo due to its cost effectiveness and its ability to be a nondestructive assay. While analyzing the effect of osimertinib, an EGFR inhibitor on the non-small cell lung cancer cell line, PC-9, we noticed unexpected right-shifts of dose response curves as compared to the curve obtained by Cell Titer Glo assay. Here, we describe our modified AB assay method to avoid right shift right shift in dose response curve. Unlike some of the redox drugs that were reported to directly affected AB reading, osimertinib itself did not directly increase AB reading. Yet, the removal of the drug containing medium prior to AB addition eliminated falsely increased reading giving comparable dose response curve as the one determined by Cell Titer Glo assay. When a panel of 11 drugs were assessed, we found that this modified AB assay eliminated unexpected similar right shifts detected in other epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. We also found that plate-to-plate variability can be minimized by adding an appropriate concentration of rhodamine B solution to the assay plates to calibrate fluorimeter sensitivity. This calibration method also enables a continuous longitudinal assay to monitor cell growth or recovery from drug toxicity over time. Our new modified AB assay is expected to provide accurate in vitro measurement of EGFR targeted therapies.",

We use this pipeline to further characterise a combination of two novel ECM peptide mimics (GPKG and LSVD) which act in vitro to enhance the transcription of ECM organisation and cell proliferation genes and in vivo to promote epithelial and dermal remodelling.

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence supports an instructive role for metabolism in stem cell fate decisions. However, much is yet unknown about how fetal metabolism changes during mammalian development and how altered maternal metabolism shapes fetal metabolism. Here, we present a descriptive atlas of in vivo fetal murine metabolism during mid-to-late gestation in normal and diabetic pregnancy. Using 13C-glucose and LC-MS, we profiled the metabolism of fetal brains, hearts, livers, and placentas harvested from pregnant dams between embryonic days (E)10.5 and 18.5. Comparative analysis of our large metabolomics dataset revealed metabolic features specific to fetal tissues developed under a hyperglycemic environment as well as metabolic signatures that may denote developmental transitions during euglycemic development. We observed sorbitol accumulation in fetal tissues and altered neurotransmitter levels in fetal brains isolated from dams with maternal hyperglycemia. Tracing 13C-glucose revealed disparate nutrient sourcing in fetuses depending on maternal glycemic states. Regardless of glycemic state, histidine-derived metabolites accumulated during late development in fetal tissues and maternal plasma. Our rich dataset presents a comprehensive overview of in vivo fetal tissue metabolism and alterations occurring as a result of maternal hyperglycemia.",

    "abstract": "DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are deleterious lesions that challenge genome integrity. To mitigate this threat, human cells rely on the activity of multiple DNA repair machineries that are tightly regulated throughout the cell cycle1. In interphase, DSBs are mainly repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR)2. However, these pathways are completely inhibited in mitosis3-5, leaving the fate of mitotic DSBs unknown. Here we show that DNA polymerase theta (Pol{theta})6 repairs mitotic DSBs and thereby maintains genome integrity. In contrast to other DSB repair factors, Pol{theta} function is activated in mitosis upon phosphorylation by the Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). Phosphorylated Pol{theta} is recruited to mitotic DSBs, where it mediates joining of broken DNA ends, while halting mitotic progression. The lack of Pol{theta} leads to a shortening of mitotic duration and defective repair of mitotic DSBs, resulting in a loss of genome integrity. In addition, we identify mitotic Pol{theta} repair as the underlying cause of the synthetic lethality between Pol{theta} and HR. Our findings reveal the critical importance of mitotic DSB repair for maintaining genome stability.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian cells adhere to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and sense mechanical cues through integrin-mediated adhesions1, 2. Focal adhesions and related structures are the primary architectures that transmit forces between the ECM and the actin cytoskeleton. Although focal adhesions are abundant when cells are cultured on rigid substrates, they are sparse in soft environments that cannot support high mechanical tensions3. Here, we report a new class of integrin-mediated adhesions, curved adhesions, whose formation is regulated by membrane curvature instead of mechanical tension. In soft matrices made of protein fibres, curved adhesions are induced by membrane curvatures imposed by the fibre geometry. Curved adhesions are mediated by integrin [a]V{beta}5 and are molecularly distinct from focal adhesions and clathrin lattices. The molecular mechanism involves a previously unknown interaction between integrin {beta}5 and a curvature-sensing protein FCHo2. We find that curved adhesions are prevalent in physiologically relevant environments. Disruption of curved adhesions by knocking down integrin {beta}5 or FCHo2 abolishes the migration of multiple cancer cell lines in 3D matrices. These findings provide a mechanism of cell anchorage to natural protein fibres that are too soft to support the formation of focal adhesions. Given their functional importance for 3D cell migration, curved adhesions may serve as a therapeutic target for future development.",

    "abstract": "Tetraploid and hexaploid wheat have multiple genomes, with successful meiosis and preservation of fertility relying on synapsis and crossover only taking place between homologous chromosomes. In hexaploid wheat, the major meiotic gene TaZIP4-B2 (Ph1) on chromosome 5B, promotes crossover between homologous chromosomes, whilst suppressing crossover between homeologous (related) chromosomes. Tetraploid wheat has three ZIP4 copies: TtZIP4-A1 on chromosome 3A, TtZIP4-B1 on 3B and TtZIP4-B2 on 5B. Previous studies showed that ZIP4 mutations eliminate approximately 85% of crossovers, consistent with loss of the class I crossover pathway. Here, we show that disruption of two ZIP4 gene copies in Ttzip4-A1B1 double mutants, results in a 76-78% reduction in crossovers when compared to wild-type plants. Moreover, when all three copies are disrupted in Ttzip4-A1B1B2 triple mutants, crossover is reduced by over 95%, suggesting that the TtZIP4-B2 copy is also affecting class II crossovers. This implies that, in wheat, the class I and class II crossover pathways may be interlinked. When ZIP4 duplicated and diverged from chromosome 3B on wheat polyploidization, the new 5B copy, TaZIP4-B2, may have acquired an additional function to stabilize both crossover pathways. In plants deficient in all three ZIP4 copies, synapsis is delayed and does not complete, consistent with our previous studies in hexaploid wheat, when a similar delay in synapsis was observed in a 59.3Mb deletion mutant, ph1b, encompassing the TaZIP4-B2 gene on chromosome 5B. These findings confirm the requirement of ZIP4-B2 for efficient synapsis, and suggest that TtZIP4 genes have a stronger effect on synapsis than previously described in Arabidopsis and rice. Thus, ZIP4-B2 accounts for the two major phenotypes reported for Ph1, promotion of homologous synapsis and suppression of homeologous crossover.\n\nKey messageIn tetraploid wheat, ZIP4 is required for efficient chromosome synapsis and for over 95% of crossovers, involving both the class I and class II crossover pathways.\n\nAuthor contribution statementTD grew and maintained the plants, made the crosses, carried out the KASP genotyping and sequencing, carried out the meiotic metaphase I studies and produced the corresponding figure, and wrote the manuscript.

While the majority of bacterial viruses, phages, use chromosomally-encoded cell surface structures as receptors, plasmid-dependent phages exploit plasmid-encoded conjugation proteins, making their host range dependent on horizontal transfer of the plasmid. Despite their unique biology and biotechnological significance, only a small number of plasmid-dependent phages have been characterized. Here we systematically search for new plasmid-dependent phages using a targeted discovery platform, and find that they are in fact common and abundant in nature, and vastly unexplored in terms of their genetic diversity. Plasmid-dependent tectiviruses have highly conserved genetic architecture but show profound differences in their host range which do not reflect bacterial phylogeny. Finally, we show that plasmid-dependent tectiviruses are missed by metaviromic analyses, showing the continued importance of culture-based phage discovery. Taken together, these results indicate plasmid-dependent phages play an unappreciated evolutionary role in constraining horizontal gene transfer.",

As plant cells are surrounded by walls, polarized cell shape and protein polarity in the plasma membrane are particularly important for normal physiology and development. We have identified WALLFLOWER (WFL), a transmembrane receptor kinase that is asymmetrically distributed at the inner face of epidermal cells and this localization is maintained independent of cell type. In epidermal hair (H) cells in the elongation and differentiation zones, WFL exhibits a dual polar localization, accumulating at the inner domain as well as at the root hair initiation domain (RHID). Furthermore, overexpression of WFL leads to a downward shift in root hair (RH) position suggesting WFL operates in a signaling pathway that functions across H cells to inform RH position. WFL asymmetric distribution and function is affected by deletion of the intracellular domains resulting in its mislocalization to the outer polar domain of H cells and exclusion from RHIDs and bulges. Thus, our results demonstrate that in epidermal H cells the WFL intracellular domains are required to direct its dual polar localization and influence RH position.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYA receptor kinase with dual polar localization, to the inner polar domain and root hair initiation domain, in root epidermal cells, requires its intracellular domain for localization and function.",

Here, we show that TgREMIND, a Toxoplasma gondii protein containing a membrane phospholipid interacting domain, is required for the biogenesis of rhoptries and dense granules. TgREMIND contains a Fes/CIP4 homology-Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (F-BAR) domain at the N-terminus, known to promote cell membrane bending, and a novel uncharacterized domain that we named REMIND for regulator of membrane interacting domain at the C-terminus. TgREMIND binds to PIP2 lipid species and both F-BAR and REMIND domains are necessary to ensure proper biological activities in vitro and in cellulo. Conditional depletion of TgREMIND results in the absence of dense granules and abnormal transparent rhoptries, leading to a severe inhibition of parasite motility, host invasion, and dissemination.

    "abstract": "Mutations in Myelin Protein Zero (MPZ) account for 5% of Charcot-Marie-Tooth cases and can cause demyelinating or axonal phenotypes, reflecting the diverse roles of MPZ in Schwann cells. MPZ holds the apposing membranes of the myelin sheath together, with the adhesion role fulfilled by the extracellular lmmunoglobulin-like domain (lgMPZ), which can oligomerize. Current knowledge for how the lgMPZ might form oligomeric assemblies involving 3 weakly-interacting interfaces has been extrapolated from a protein crystal structure in which individual rat lgMPZ subunits are packed together under artificial conditions. These interfaces include one that organizes the lgMPZ into tetramers, a  dimer interface that could link tetramers together, and a third hydrophobic interface that could mediate binding to lipid bilayers or the same hydrophobic surface on another lgMPZ domain. There are at present no data confirming whether the proposed lgMPZ interfaces actually mediate oligomerization in solution, whether they are required for the adhesion activity of MPZ, whether they are important for myelination, or whether their loss results in disease. We performed NMR and SAXS analysis of wild-type lgMPZ as well as mutant forms with amino-acid substitutions designed to interrupt its presumptive oligomerization interfaces. Here, we confirm the interface that mediates lgMPZ tetramerization, but find that dimerization is mediated by a distinct interface that has yet to be identified. We next correlated CMT phenotypes to subregions within lgMPZ tetramers. Axonal late-onset disease phenotypes (CMT2l/J) map to surface residues of lgMPZ proximal to the transmembrane domain. Early-onset demyelinating disease phenotypes (CMT1B/Dejerine-Sottas syndrome) map to two groups: one is described by variants that disrupt the stability of the lg-fold itself and are largely located within the core of the lg domain; whereas another describes a surface on the distal outer surface of lgMPZ tetramers. Computational docking studies predict that this latter disease-relevant subregion may mediate dimerization of lgMPZ tetramers.",

    "abstract": "The majority of human connectome studies in the literature based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data use either an anterior-to-posterior (AP) or a posterior-to-anterior (PA) phase encoding direction. However, whether and how phase encoding direction would affect test-retest reliability of functional connectome is unclear. Here, in a sample of healthy subjects with two sessions of fMRI scans separated by 12 weeks (two runs per session, one with AP, the other with PA), we tested the influence of phase encoding direction on global and nodal connectivity in the constructed brain networks. All data underwent the state-of-the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) pipeline to correct for phase-encoding-related distortions before entering analysis. We found that at the global level, the PA scans showed significantly higher intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for global connectivity compared with AP scans, which was particularly prominent when using the Seitzman-300 atlas (versus the CAB-NP-718 atlas). At the nodal level, regions most strongly affected by phase encoding direction were consistently mapped to the cingulate cortex and temporal lobe, with significantly higher ICCs during PA scans compared with AP scans, regardless of atlas. Further, we demonstrated that the observed reliability differences between phase encoding directions may relate to a similar effect on the reliability of temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) in the same regions (that PA scans were associated with higher reliability of tSNR than AP scans). Averaging the connectivity outcome from the AP and PA scans could slightly, but overall have limited value to boost the ICCs. These results were largely replicated in an independent, public dataset from the HCP-Early Psychosis (HCP-EP) study with a similar design but a much shorter scan session interval. Our findings suggest that phase encoding direction has significant effects on the reliability of connectomic estimates in fMRI studies. We urge that these effects need to be carefully considered in future neuroimaging designs, especially in longitudinal studies such as those related to neurodevelopment or clinical intervention.",

    "abstract": "The metabolic need of the premature oligodendrocytes (Pre-OLs) and mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) are distinct. The metabolic control of oligodendrocyte maturation is not fully understood. Here we show that the terminal maturation and higher mitochondrial respiration in the oligodendrocyte is an integrated process controlled through pyruvate dehydrogenase (Pdh). Combined bioenergetics and metabolic studies show that mature oligodendrocytes show elevated TCA cycle activity than the premature oligodendrocytes. Our signaling studies show that the increased TCA cycle activity is mediated by the activation of Pdh due to inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenases isoform-1 (Pdhk1) that phosphorylates and inhibits Pdh. Accordingly, when Pdhk1 is directly expressed in the premature oligodendrocytes, they fail to mature. While Pdh converts pyruvate into the acetyl-CoA by its oxidative decarboxylation, our study shows that Pdh also activates a unique molecular switch required for oligodendrocyte maturation by acetylating the bHLH family transcription factor Olig1. Pdh inhibition via Pdhk1 blocks the Olig1-acetylation and hence, oligodendrocyte maturation. Using the cuprizone model of demyelination, we show that Pdh is deactivated during the demyelination phase, which is reversed in the remyelination phase upon cuprizone withdrawal. In addition, Pdh activity status correlates with the Olig1-acetylation status. Hence, the Pdh metabolic node activation allows a robust mitochondrial respiration and activation of a molecular program necessary for the terminal maturation of oligodendrocytes. Our findings open a new dialogue in the developmental biology that links cellular development and metabolism. These findings have far-reaching implications for the development of therapies for a variety of demyelinating disorders including multiple sclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Sensory perception is dramatically influenced by the context. Models of contextual neural surround effects in vision have mostly accounted for Primary Visual Cortex (V1) data, via nonlinear computations such as divisive normalization. However, surround effects are not well understood within a hierarchy, for neurons with more complex stimulus selectivity beyond V1. We utilized feedforward deep convolutional neural networks and developed a gradient-based technique to visualize the most suppressive and excitatory surround. We found that deep neural networks exhibited a key signature of surround effects in V1, highlighting center stimuli that visually stand out from the surround and suppressing responses when the surround stimulus is similar to the center. We found that in some neurons, especially in late layers, when the center stimulus was altered, the most suppressive surround surprisingly can follow the change. Through the visualization approach, we generalized previous understanding of surround effects to more complex stimuli, in ways that have not been revealed in visual cortices. In contrast, the suppression based on center surround similarity was not observed in an untrained network. We identified further successes and mismatches of the feedforward CNNs to the biology. Our results provide a testable hypothesis of surround effects in higher visual cortices, and the visualization approach could be adopted in future biological experimental designs.\n\nAuthor summaryNeural responses and perception of a visual stimulus are influenced by the context, such as what spatially surrounds a given feature. Contextual surround effects have been extensively studied in the early visual cortex. But the brain processes visual inputs hierarchically, from simple features up to complex objects in higher visual areas. Contextual effects are not well understood for higher areas of cortex and for more complex stimuli. Utilizing artificial deep neural networks and a visualization technique we developed, we found that deep networks exhibited a key signature of surround effects in the early visual cortex, highlighting center stimuli that visually stand out from the surround and suppressing responses when the surround stimulus is similar to the center. We found in some neurons, especially in late layers, when the center stimulus was altered, the most suppressive surround could surprisingly follow. This is a generalization of known surround effects for more complex stimuli that has not been revealed in the visual cortex. Our findings relate to notions of efficient coding and salience perception, and emerged without incorporating specialized nonlinear computations typically used to explain contextual effects in the early cortex. Our visualization approach provides a new experimental paradigm and a testable hypothesis of surround effects for more complex stimuli in higher cortical areas; the visualization approach could be adopted in biological experimental designs.",

    "abstract": "Altricial young of many species beg parents for the nutrients required for healthy development. From human crying to begging chicks, young expend precious energy reserves to communicate their hunger. Despite repeated independent evolutionary origins, the neural basis of parent-directed communication by infants is unknown. Here, we examined the sensory and neural basis of begging behavior in tadpoles of the monogamous and biparental Mimetic poison frog (Ranitomeya imitator). In this species, tadpoles beg parents for egg meals by dancing. We used this robust motor display to determine that tadpoles use multimodal cues for caregiver recognition, where olfactory cues are necessary for caregiver recognition while visual cues provide an orientation goal. We found that dopamine related brain regions have higher neural activity in begging tadpoles and that dopamine signaling had opposing modulatory effects through D1 and D2 family receptors, similar to swimming behavior in other tadpole species. We then identified caudal posterior tuberculum dopamine neurons as more active during begging behavior and sensitive to caregiver olfactory cues. Projections of these dopaminergic neurons to the spinal accessory motor nucleus are required for begging displays. These findings support the idea that dopamine regulates olfactory-guided parental recognition in young and opens many avenues for studying how new communication behaviors can evolve from ancestral motor circuits.",

    "abstract": "Pain of unknown etiology is frequent in individuals with the tumor predisposition syndrome Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), even when tumors are absent. Schwann cells (SC) were recently shown to play roles in nociceptive processing, and we find that chemogenetic activation of SCs is sufficient to induce afferent and behavioral mechanical hypersensitivity in mice. In mouse models, animals show afferent and behavioral hypersensitivity when SC, but not neurons, lack Nf1. Importantly, hypersensitivity corresponds with SC-specific upregulation of mRNA encoding glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), independent of the presence of tumors. Neuropathic pain-like behaviors in the NF1 mice were inhibited by either chemogenetic silencing of SC calcium or by systemic delivery of GDNF targeting antibodies. Together, these findings suggest that Nf1 loss in SCs causes mechanical pain by influencing adjacent neurons and, data may identify cell-specific treatment strategies to ameliorate pain in individuals with NF1.\n\nGraphical AbstractGDNF released from Schwann cells acts on sensory neurons leading to mechanical hypersensitivity and pain-like behaviors in preclinical models of NF1.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=181 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/533004v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d17177org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@706f56org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19db1ccorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3e28d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Several rRNA modifying enzymes install rRNA modifications while participating in ribosome assembly. Here, we show that 18S rRNA methyltransferase DIMT1 is essential for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) proliferation through a non-catalytic function. We reveal that targeting a positively charged cleft of DIMT1, remote from the catalytic site, weakens the binding of DIMT1 to rRNA and mis-localizes DIMT1 to the nucleoplasm, in contrast with the primarily nucleolar localization of wild-type DIMT1. Mechanistically, rRNA binding is required for DIMT1 to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation, which explains why the distinct nucleoplasm localization of the rRNA-binding deficient DIMT1. Re-expression of wild-type or a catalytically inactive mutant E85A, but not the rRNA-binding deficient DIMT1, supports AML cell proliferation. This study provides a new strategy to target DIMT1-regulated AML proliferation via targeting this essential non-catalytic region.",

Despite binding to target motifs in closed chromatin, many pioneer factors display cell-type specific binding and activity. The mechanisms governing pioneer-factor occupancy and the relationship between chromatin occupancy and opening remain unclear. We studied three Drosophila transcription factors with distinct DNA-binding domains and biological functions: Zelda, Grainy head, and Twist. We demonstrated that the level of chromatin occupancy is a key determinant of pioneering activity. Multiple factors regulate occupancy, including motif content, local chromatin, and protein concentration. Regions outside the DNA-binding domain are required for binding and chromatin opening. Our results show that pioneering activity is not a binary feature intrinsic to a protein but occurs on a spectrum and is regulated by a variety of protein-intrinsic and cell-type-specific features.",

    "abstract": "Economic stress can serve as a \"second-hit\" for those who already accumulated a history of adverse life experiences. How one recovers from a setback is a core feature of resilience but is seldom captured in animal studies. We challenged mice in a novel two-hit stress model by exposing animals to chronic social defeat stress (first-hit) and then testing how mice adapt to reward scarcity on a neuroeconomic task (second-hit). Mice were tested longitudinally across months on the Restaurant Row task during which mice foraged daily for their sole source of food while on a limited time budget. An abrupt transition into a reward-scarce environment on this task elicits an economic crisis, precipitating a massive drop in food intake and body weight to which mice must respond in order to survive. We found that mice with a history of social defeat mounted a robust behavioral response to this economic challenge. This recovery was achieved through a complex redistribution of how time was allocated among competing opportunities via multiple valuation algorithms. Interestingly, we found that mice with a history of social defeat displayed changes in the development of decision-making policies during the recovery process important for not only ensuring food security necessary for survival but also prioritizing subjective value. These findings indicate that an individuals capacity to \"bounce back\" from economic stress depends on ones prior history of stress and can affect multiple aspects of subjective well-being, highlighting a motivational balance that may be altered in stress-related disorders such as depression.\n\nIn BriefDurand-de Cuttoli et al. found that after chronic social defeat stress, when mice were subsequently challenged on a neuroeconomic foraging task, an economic stressor can serve as a \"second hit\" and reveal changes in the development of complex decision-making strategies important for maintaining the balance between food security and subjective well-being.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are constantly exposed to pathogens, including viruses. However, serious brain infection via the olfactory route rarely occurs. When OSNs detect a virus, they coordinate local antiviral immune responses to stop virus progression to the brain. Despite effective immune control in the olfactory periphery, pathogen-triggered neuronal signals reach the CNS via the olfactory bulb (OB). We hypothesized that neuronal detection of a virus by OSNs initiates neuroimmune responses in the OB that prevent pathogen invasion. Using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model, we demonstrate viral-specific neuronal activation of OSNs projecting into the OB, indicating that OSNs are electrically activated by viruses. Further, behavioral changes are seen in both adult and larval zebrafish after viral exposure. By profiling the transcription of single cells in the OB after OSNs are exposed to virus, we found that both microglia and neurons enter a protective state. Microglia and macrophage populations in the OB respond within minutes of nasal viral delivery followed decreased expression of neuronal differentiation factors and enrichment of genes in the neuropeptide signaling pathway in neuronal clusters. Pituitary adenylate-cyclase-activating polypeptide (pacap), a known antimicrobial, was especially enriched in a neuronal cluster. We confirm that PACAP is antiviral in vitro and that PACAP expression increases in the OB 1 day post-viral treatment. Our work reveals how encounters with viruses in the olfactory periphery shape the vertebrate brain by inducing antimicrobial programs in neurons and by altering host behavior.",

How HIV depletes CD4+ T cells in humans remains unknown because vast majority of the dying CD4+ T cells in patients are uninfected. Burgeoning evidence supports the hypothesis that non-productive HIV-1 infection triggers CD4+ T-cell depletion in the course of pathogenic HIV and SIV infections. Here, we report that the CARD8 inflammasome is activated immediately after HIV-1 entry by the viral protease encapsulated in the incoming HIV-1 particles. Sensing of HIV-1 protease activity by the CARD8 inflammasome leads to rapid pyroptosis of quiescent CD4+ T cells without productive viral infection. In humanized mice reconstituted with a CARD8-deficient immune system, CD4+ T-cell loss is delayed despite increased levels of HIV-1 replication. Our study suggests that the CARD8 inflammasome drives CD4+ T-cell depletion and disease progression through rapid sensing of HIV-1 particles.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas is an adaptive immune system that allows bacteria to inactivate mobile genetic elements. Approximately 50% of bacteria harbor CRISPR-cas, however in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, CRISPR-cas loci are less common and often studied in heterologous systems. We analyzed the prevalence of CRISPR-cas in genomes of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated in Denmark. Only 2.9 % of the strains carried CRISPR-cas systems, but for strains of sequence type ST630 over half were positive. All CRISPR-cas loci were type III-A and located within the staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (SCCmec) type V(5C2&5) conferring {beta}-lactam resistance. Curiously, only 23 different CRISPR spacers were identified in 69 CRISPR-positive strains and almost identical SCCmec cassettes, CRISPR arrays and cas genes, are present in staphylococcal species other than aureus, suggesting that these were transferred horizontally. For the ST630 strain 110900, we demonstrate that the SCCmec cassette containing CRISPR-cas excises from the chromosome at high frequency. However, the cassette was not transferable under the conditions investigated. One of the CRISPR spacers targets a late gene in the lytic bacteriophage (phage) virus philPLA-RODI, and we show that the system protects against phage infection by reducing phage burst size. However, CRISPR-Cas can be overloaded or bypassed by CRISPR escape mutants. Our results imply that the endogenous type III-A CRISPR-Cas system in S. aureus is active against targeted phages, albeit with low efficacy. This suggests native S. aureus CRISPR-Cas offers only partial immunity, and in nature may work in tandem with other defense systems.\n\nImportanceCRISPR-Cas is an adaptive immune system enabling bacteria and archaea to protect themselves against mobile genetic elements such as phages. In strains of Staphylococcus aureus, CRISPR-cas is rare, but when present, it is located within the SCCmec element encoding resistance to methicillin and other {beta}-lactam antibiotics. We show that the entire module is excisable, with almost identical versions found in different species of non-aureus staphylococci suggesting that the system only rarely acquires new spacers in S. aureus. Additionally, we show that in its endogenous form, the S. aureus CRISPR-Cas is active but inefficient against lytic phages, with phages being able to form escape mutants or overload the system. This leads us to propose that CRISPR-Cas in S. aureus offers only partial immunity in native systems, and so may work together with other defense systems to prevent phage-mediated killing.",

K8.1, the major antigenic component of the KSHV virion, has been reported to play a critical role in the infection of certain B cells, but otherwise its function remains enigmatic. We created a K8.1 knockout virus (KSHV{Delta}K8.1) in the BAC16 genetic background and analyzed its infectivity on a range of adherent cells. We observed a strong defect on several epithelial cells, e.g. the HaCaT keratinocyte model cell line, HEK 293T and A549 lung epithelial cells, but no such defect on other cells, among them e.g. lymphatic and blood endothelial cells. Mechanistically, we found that reduced infectivity of the K8.1 knockout virus correlated with reduced attachment to HaCaT cells. The defect in infectivity of KSHV{Delta}K8.1 could be rescued by complementation through expression of K8.1 in KSHV{Delta}K8.1 producing cells by means of a lentiviral vector. In a coculture infection model, KSHV{Delta}K8.1 was highly efficient at infecting the BJAB B cell line but was significantly impaired at infecting the MC116 B cell line, in line with a previous report. In fusion assays together with the gH/gL glycoprotein complex and gB, the components of the conserved herpesviral core fusion machinery, we did not observe activation of membrane fusion by K8.1 or its R8.1 homolog of the rhesus monkey rhadinovirus. In summary, we found K8.1 to function in a highly cell-specific manner during KSHV entry at the attachment step, playing an important role in the infection of epithelial cells.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsHuman genetic variation is thought to guide the outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection but model systems within which to dissect these host genetic mechanisms are limited. Norway rat hepacivirus (NrHV), closely related to HCV, causes chronic liver infection in rats but causes acute self-limiting hepatitis in typical strains of laboratory mice, which resolves in two weeks. The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a robust mouse genetics resource comprised of a panel of recombinant inbred strains, which model the complexity of the human genome and provide a system within which to understand diseases driven by complex allelic variation.\n\nApproach & ResultsWe infected a panel of CC strains with NrHV and identified several that failed to clear virus after 4 weeks. Strains displayed an array of virologic phenotypes ranging from delayed clearance (CC046) to chronicity (CC071, CC080) with viremia for at least 10 months. Body weight loss, hepatocyte infection frequency, viral evolution, T-cell recruitment to the liver, liver inflammation and the capacity to develop liver fibrosis varied among infected CC strains.\n\nConclusionsThese models recapitulate many aspects of HCV infection in humans and demonstrate that host genetic variation affects a multitude of virus and host phenotypes. These models can be used to better understand the molecular mechanisms that drive hepacivirus clearance and chronicity, the virus and host interactions that promote chronic disease manifestations like liver fibrosis, therapeutic and vaccine performance, and how these factors are affected by host genetic variation.",

Herein, we found that DDX3X variants with significantly impaired ATPase activities demixed into the shells of unique hollow condensates, the dynamics of which were further differentiated by the RNA binding affinities of the different DDX3X variants. Proteomic and imaging studies revealed that DDX3X variant condensates sequestered wild-type DDX3X, DDX3Y, and other proteins important for various signaling pathways. Intriguingly, wild-type DDX3X improved the dynamics of heterogenous variant/wild-type hollow condensates more than DDX3Y.

    "abstract": "Cerebral small vessels are largely inaccessible to existing clinical in vivo imaging technologies. This study aims to present a novel analysis pipeline for vessel density mapping of cerebral small vessels from high-resolution 3D black-blood MRI at 3T. Twenty-eight subjects (10 under 35 years old, 18 over 60 years old) were imaged with the T1-weighted turbo spin-echo with variable flip angles (T1w TSE-VFA) sequence optimized for black-blood small vessel imaging with iso-0.5mm spatial resolution at 3T. Hessian-based vessel segmentation methods (Jerman, Frangi and Sato filter) were evaluated by vessel landmarks and manual annotation of lenticulostriate arteries (LSAs). Using optimized vessel segmentation, large vessel pruning and non-linear registration, a semiautomatic pipeline was proposed for quantification of small vessel density across brain regions and further for localized detection of small vessel changes across populations. Voxel-level statistics was performed to compare vessel density between two age groups. Additionally, local vessel density of aged subjects was correlated with their corresponding gross cognitive and executive function (EF) scores using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and EF composite scores compiled with Item Response Theory (IRT). Jerman filter showed better performance for vessel segmentation than Frangi and Sato filter which was employed in our pipeline. Cerebral small vessels on the order of a few hundred microns can be delineated using the proposed analysis pipeline on 3D black-blood MRI at 3T. The mean vessel density across brain regions was significantly higher in young subjects compared to aged subjects. In the aged subjects, localized vessel density was positively correlated with MoCA and IRT EF scores. The proposed pipeline is able to segment, quantify, and detect localized differences in vessel density of cerebral small vessels based on 3D high-resolution black-blood MRI. This framework may serve as a tool for localized detection of small vessel density changes in normal aging and cerebral small vessel disease.",

    "abstract": "HIV causes chronic inflammation and AIDS in humans, though the rate of disease progression varies between individuals. Similarly, simian lentiviruses vary in their pathogenicity based on characteristics of both the host (simian species) and virus strain. Here, we profile immune responses in pig-tailed macaques infected with variants of SIV that differ in virulence to understand the immune mechanisms underlying lentiviral pathogenicity. Compared to a minimally pathogenic lentiviral variant, infection with a highly pathogenic variant results in a more delayed, broad, and sustained activation of inflammatory pathways, including an extensive global interferon signature. Conversely, individual cells infected with highly pathogenic lentivirus upregulated fewer interferon-stimulated genes at a lower magnitude, indicating that highly pathogenic lentivirus has evolved to partially escape from interferon responses. Further, we identified distinct gene co-expression patterns and cell-cell communication pathways that implicate CXCL10 and CXCL16 as important molecular drivers of inflammatory pathways specifically in response to highly pathogenic lentivirus infection. Immune responses to highly pathogenic lentivirus infection are characterized by amplifying regulatory circuits of pro-inflammatory cytokines with dense longitudinal connectivity. Our work presents a model of lentiviral pathogenicity where failures in early viral control mechanisms lead to delayed, sustained, and amplifying pro-inflammatory circuits, which has implications for other viral infections with highly variable disease courses.",

Given the anionic nature of both Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacterial cell envelopes, negatively charged molecules are particularly difficult to deliver into these organisms. Many strategies have been employed to penetrate bacteria ranging from reagents such as cell-penetrating peptides, enzymes, and metal-chelating compounds, to physical perturbations. While cationic polymers are known antimicrobial agents, their ability to permeabilize bacterial cells without causing high levels of toxicity and cell lysis has not been demonstrated. Here, we evaluate the ability of four cationic polymers, two linear and two micellar (from self-assembled amphiphilic block copolymers), to facilitate the internalization of an anionic ATP-based chemical probe into Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Not only did we observe the permeabilization of these organisms, but also found that labeled cells were able to continue to grow and divide. In particular, the micelle-based polymers yielded effective internalization of the negatively charged chemical probe better than their linear analogues.",

    "abstract": "Schlafen (SLFN) is a family of proteins upregulated by type I interferons with a regulatory role in translation. Intriguingly, SLFN14 associates with the ribosome and can degrade rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA in vitro, but a role in translation is still unknown. Ribosomes are important regulatory hubs during translation elongation of mRNAs rich in rare codons. Therefore, we evaluated the potential role of SLFN14 in the expression of mRNAs enriched in rare codons, using HIV-1 genes as a model. We found that SLFN14 regulates in a variety of cell types, including primary immune cells, the expression of HIV-1 and non-viral genes based on their codon adaptation index, a measurement of the synonymous codon usage bias; consequently, SLFN14 inhibited the replication of HIV-1. The potent inhibitory effect of SLFN14 on the expression of the rare codon-rich transcript HIV-1 Gag was minimized by codon optimization. Mechanistically, we found that the endoribonuclease activity of SLFN14 is required, and that ribosomal, but not messenger, RNA degradation is associated with the transcript selectivity of SLFN14. Therefore, we propose that SLFN14 impairs the expression of transcripts rich in rare codons, in a catalytic-dependent manner.",

Cryopreservation and biobanking to secure the genetics of threatened populations is currently limited to coral sperm and larvae, which are only available during brief annual spawning events and are impacted by ocean warming, so there is an urgent need for methods to enable biobanking activities year-round. Here, we used vitrification and nanowarming to successfully recover adult coral tissues in a novel sample type, the single-polyp microfragment (SPMF). Fluorescence and confocal microscopy showed clearly defined tissues and green fluorescent protein fluorescence around the polyp mouth post-warming in 43.3% of SPMFs at 24 hours post-warming, and 30.0% at one month. These advances provide a basis for continued research and development of a field-ready protocol for cryopreservation of adult coral tissues, to permit biobanking of threatened coral species throughout the year and support reef restoration efforts.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive divergence leading to speciation is the major evolutionary process generating diversity in life forms. The most commonly observed form of speciation is allopatric speciation which requires that gene flow be prevented between populations by physical or temporal barriers, as they adapt to their respective environments. Eventually, these adaptive responses drive the populations far apart in the genotypic space such that individuals from the two populations become reproductively isolated. A widely accepted theory is that speciation simply occurs as a by-product of adaptive response of the populations1,2. Several ecological and laboratory examples of allopatric speciation exist3-6. However, we know little about the nature (pre- or post-zygotic) of barriers that arise first in this process. Understanding the first barriers that arise between populations is key, as populations diverge towards becoming distinct species. In recent years, fungi been used as model organisms to answer questions related to evolution of reproductive isolation3,7-9. Here we show rapid evolution of pre-zygotic barriers between allopatric yeast populations. We further demonstrate that these pre-zygotic barriers arise due to altered mating kinetics of the evolved population. Moreover, our non-adaptive evolution experiments with yeast under limited selection pressure also show rapid emergence of reproductive isolation. Overall, our results show that evolution of pre-zygotic reproductive barriers can occur as result of natural selection or drift. These barriers result because of altered mating kinetics or mate preference.\n\nOne sentence summaryPre-zygotic barriers to gene flow can arise due to adaptation or drift.",

Apart from being an important scaling parameter for demographic and phylogenetic inference, it allows one to understand at what rate new genetic diversity is generated and what is the expected level of genetic diversity in a population at equilibrium. However, except for well-established model organisms, accurate estimates of de novo mutation rates are available for a very limited number of organisms from the wild. We estimated mutation rates ({micro}) in two marine populations of the nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) with the aid of several 2- and 3-generational family pedigrees, deep (>50x) whole genome re-sequencing and a high-quality reference genome. After stringent filtering, we discovered 295 germline mutations from 106 offspring translating to {micro} = 4.64 x 10-9 and {micro} = 4.08 x 10-9 per base, per generation, in the two populations, respectively. Twenty percent of the mutations were shared by full-sibs showing that the level of parental mosaicism was relatively high. Since the estimated {micro} was 3.2 times smaller than the commonly used substitution rate, recalibration with {micro} led to substantial increase in estimated divergence times between different stickleback species. Our estimates of de novo mutation rate should provide a useful resource for research focused on fish population genetics and that of sticklebacks in particular.",

    "abstract": "In the unpredictable Anthropocene, a particularly pressing open question is how certain species invade urban environments. Sex-biased dispersal and learning arguably influence movement ecology, but their joint influence remains unexplored empirically, and might vary by space and time. We assayed reinforcement learning in wild-caught, temporarily-captive core, middle- or edge-range great-tailed grackles--a bird species undergoing urban-tracking rapid range expansion, led by dispersing males. We show: across populations, both sexes initially perform similarly when learning stimulus-reward pairings, but, when reward contingencies reverse, male--versus female--grackles finish  relearning faster, making fewer choice-option switches. How do male grackles do this? Bayesian cognitive modelling revealed male grackles choice behaviour is governed more strongly by the  weight of relative differences in recent foraging returns--i.e., they show more pronounced reward-payoff sensitivity. Confirming this mechanism, agent-based forward simulations of reinforcement learning--where we simulate  birds based on empirical estimates of our grackles reinforcement learning--replicate our sex-difference behavioural data. Finally, evolutionary modelling revealed natural selection should favour risk-sensitive learning in characteristically urban-like environments: stable but stochastic settings. Together, these results imply risk-sensitive learning is a winning strategy for urban-invasion leaders, underscoring the potential for life history and cognition to shape invasion success in human-modified environments.",

    "abstract": "O-linked N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) is a ubiquitous and dynamic yet still relatively poorly understood non-canonical glycosylation of intracellular proteins. Several vital branches of metabolism converge at the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) to produce the substrate for protein O-GlcNAcylation the uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). Availability of this metabolite is considered a key regulator of O-GlcNAcylation. Yet UDP-GlcNAc concentrations are rarely reported in studies exploring the HBP and O-GlcNAcylation, most likely because the methods to measure it restrict to specialized chromatographic procedures. To overcome this limitation, we introduce here an enzymatic method to quantify cellular and tissue UDP-GlcNAc. The method is based on O-GlcNAcylation of a substrate peptide by recombinant O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) and detection of the modification with a specific antibody. The assay can be performed in dot blot or microplate formats. The key to successful assay was the removal of strong inhibition of OGT by the reaction side product, uridine diphosphate (UDP). We applied the assay to provide the first systematic report of UDP-GlcNAc concentrations in mouse tissues and cultured cells. Furthermore, we show how changes in UDP-GlcNAc levels correlate with O-GlcNAcylation and the expression of OGT and O-GlcNAcase (OGA).",

    "abstract": "Substrate-binding proteins (SBP) are used by organisms from the three domains of life for transport and signaling. SBPs are composed of two domains that collectively trap ligands with high affinity and selectivity. To explore the role of the domains and the integrity of the hinge region between them in the function and conformation of SBPs, here we describe the ligand binding, conformational stability, and folding kinetics of the Lysine Arginine Ornithine binding protein (LAO) from Salmonella thiphimurium and constructs corresponding to its two independent domains. LAO is a class II SBP formed by a continuous and a discontinuous domain. Contrary to the expected behavior based on their connectivity, the discontinuous domain shows a stable native-like structure that binds L-arginine with moderate affinity, whereas the continuous domain is barely stable and shows no detectable ligand binding. Regarding folding kinetics, studies of the entire protein revealed the presence of at least two intermediates. While the unfolding and refolding of the continuous domain exhibited only a single intermediate and simpler and faster kinetics than LAO, the folding mechanism of the discontinuous domain was complex and involved multiple intermediates. These findings suggest that in the complete protein the continuous domain nucleates folding and that its presence funnels the folding of the discontinuous domain avoiding nonproductive interactions. The strong dependence of the function, stability, and folding pathway of the lobes on their covalent association, is most likely the result of the coevolution of both domains as a single unit.",

However, the search for fragment-specific selective sweeps among bacterial strains received little to no attention so far. In our work, we demonstrate that inter-strains locus-specific selective sweeps can be detected in bacteria. We introduce the SINCOPA algorithm, the first phylogeny-based method for soft and incomplete selective sweeps detection. We use SINCOPA to explore inter-strains locus-specific selective sweeps in a dataset containing more than 500 microbial genomes. We observe strong evidence in several loci for locus-specific selective sweeps including genes involved in biofilm formation and others that are related to coping with various unfavorable environmental conditions.

We analysed the protein-coding impact of single base substitution signatures in 12,341 cancer genomes from 18 cancer types. Stop-gain mutations (SGMs) were strongly enriched in the signatures of tobacco smoking, APOBEC cytidine deaminases, and reactive oxygen species. These mutational processes affect specific trinucleotide contexts to substitute serine and glutamic acid residues with stop codons. SGMs are enriched in cancer hallmark pathways and tumor suppressors such as TP53, FAT1, and APC. Tobacco-driven SGMs in lung cancer correlate with lifetime smoking history and highlight a preventable determinant of these harmful mutations. Our study exposes SGM expansion as a genetic mechanism by which endogenous and carcinogenic mutational processes contribute to protein loss-of-function, oncogenesis, and tumor heterogeneity, providing potential translational and mechanistic insights.",

    "abstract": "Treatment-resistant tumors are frequently characterized by a low tumor mutational burden (TMB) and poor T-cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment. Conversely, good responses to immunotherapy have been associated with high TMB and T-cell infiltration. This may imply that at least a subset of mutations in TMB-high tumors result in the generation of neoepitopes that are recognized (and cleared) by T cells. Currently, methods that specifically mutate MHC-presented tumor epitopes, while preserving genomic integrity, do not exist. Here, we have employed site-directed RNA editing to specifically alter MHC-presented tumor epitopes at the transcript level, with no modification to the genomic DNA, to modulate their antigenicity and recognition by cognate T-cell receptors (TCR). We demonstrate that RNA editing can be employed as a precision tool to specifically modulate antigenicity through the formation of RNA editing derived neoepitopes, which we have termed \"editopes\". In particular, we show potent induction of a T-cell response to an optimally edited peptide (40%) compared to a non-immunogenic mutant peptide (<2%) and its WT counterpart (20%).

    "abstract": "Asthma affects nearly 260 million people worldwide, where severe asthma cases represent the most difficult to treat due to corticosteroid insensitivity. Severe asthma is associated with higher levels of TH17 and TH1 responses, accompanied by neutrophil dominated inflammation. Better understanding of the immune responses to airway allergens that promote or protect against severe asthma is critical for identifying ways to treat these patients. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ATG5 gene, which encodes for a protein required for the cellular recycling process of autophagy, has been associated with higher risk for developing severe asthma. However, the exact role for ATG5 during allergic inflammation and whether other autophagy proteins are involved remains elusive. Using genetic tools to dissect the roles for ATG5 in innate immune cells in house dust mite (HDM)-challenged mice, we have identified a specific role for ATG5 in CD11c+ lung macrophages and dendritic cells for suppressing TH17 responses and neutrophil accumulation. We found that this role for ATG5 in CD11c+ cells to regulate neutrophil accumulation during allergic airway inflammation also required other autophagy proteins but did not involve regulation of inflammasome, despite higher levels of IL-1{beta} and Caspase 1 in the lungs of mice lacking autophagy in innate immune cells. Our data support a role for autophagy in CD11c+ lung macrophages and dendritic cells to promote an immune response to airway allergens that is associated with less severe asthma by suppressing TH17 responses and neutrophil accumulation in the lung.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation is critical for controlling infections, but when left unchecked can cause tissue damage and disease. For tuberculosis, the leading cause of death due to infection1, host inflammation is responsible for the clinical symptoms2, morbidity2, and mortality3,4. Specifically, neutrophil-dominated inflammation is associated with tuberculosis disease progression3,5,6. Therefore, understanding how neutrophil functions are regulated during infection is important for developing ways to prevent disease. Atg5 was the first gene shown to specifically function within neutrophils to promote control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis7, the causative agent of tuberculosis. ATG5 is best studied for its role in autophagy8-11, however, the protective activity of ATG5 in neutrophils was unexpectedly independent of other autophagy proteins and remained elusive7. We report here that ATG5, but not other autophagy proteins, is required in neutrophils to suppress neutrophil NETosis and swarming that occur due to elevated type I interferon levels during M. tuberculosis infection. The elevated level of NETosis that results from loss of ATG5 expression contributes to the early susceptibility of Atg5fl/fl-LysM-Cre mice during M. tuberculosis infection. NETosis is associated with poor disease outcomes in tuberculosis12,13 and COVID-19 patients14,15, as well as during other inflammatory diseases in humans16,17. Our studies identify an essential regulator of NETosis and elucidate previously unappreciated roles for ATG5 during infection, which may inform the design of host-directed therapeutics modulating these pathways.",
