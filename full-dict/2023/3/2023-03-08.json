    "abstract": "How perception of sensory stimuli emerges from brain activity is a fundamental question of neuroscience. To date, two disparate lines of research have examined this question. On one hand, human neuroimaging studies have helped us understand the large-scale brain dynamics of perception. On the other hand, work in animal models (mice, typically) has led to fundamental insight into the micro-scale neural circuits underlying perception. However, translating such fundamental insight from animal models to humans has been challenging. Here, using biophysical modeling, we show that the auditory awareness negativity (AAN), an evoked response associated with perception of target sounds in noise, can be accounted for by synaptic input to the supragranular layers of auditory cortex (AC) that is present when target sounds are heard but absent when they are missed. This additional input likely arises from cortico-cortical feedback and/or non-lemniscal thalamic projections and targets the apical dendrites of layer-V pyramidal neurons (PNs). In turn, this leads to increased local field potential activity, increased spiking activity in layer-V PNs, and the AAN. The results are consistent with current cellular models of conscious processing and help bridge the gap between the macro and micro levels of perception-related brain activity.\n\nAuthor SummaryTo date, our understanding of the brain basis of conscious perception has mostly been restricted to large-scale, network-level activity that can be measured non-invasively in human subjects. However, we lack understanding of how such network-level activity is supported by individual neurons and neural circuits. This is at least partially because conscious perception is difficult to study in experimental animals, where such detailed characterization of neural activity is possible. To address this gap, we used biophysical modeling to gain circuit-level insight into an auditory brain response known as the auditory awareness negativity (AAN). This response can be recorded non-invasively in humans and is associated with perceptual awareness of sounds of interest. Our model shows that the AAN likely arises from specific cortical layers and cell types. These data help bridge the gap between circuit- and network-level theories of consciousness, and could lead to new, targeted treatments for perceptual dysfunction and disorders of consciousness.",

    "abstract": "Fear-potentiated startle (FPS) has been widely used to study fear processing in humans and rodents. Human studies have shown higher startle amplitudes and exaggerated fear reactivity to unpredictable vs. predictable threats in individuals suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although human FPS studies often use both sexes, a surprisingly limited number of rodent FPS studies use females. Here we investigate the effects of signal-threat contingency, signal-threat order and threat predictability on FPS in both sexes. We use a classic fear-conditioning protocol (100% contingency of cue and shock pairings, with forward conditioning such that the cue co-terminates with the shock) and compare it to modified fear-conditioning protocols (70% contingency; backward conditioning; or cue and shock unpaired). Although there are no sex differences in the startle amplitudes when corrected for body weight, females demonstrate higher shock reactivity during fear-conditioning. Both sexes demonstrate comparable levels of cued, non-cued, and contextual fear in the classic FPS but females show reduced fear discrimination vs. males. Fear-conditioning with 70% contingency or backward order (cue co-starts with shock) induces similar levels of cued, non-cued, and contextual fear in both sexes but they differ in contextual fear extinction. Lastly, a prominent sex difference is uncovered following unpredictable fear-conditioning protocol (cue and shock un-paired), with females showing significantly higher startle overall during the FPS recall, regardless of trial type, and higher contextual fear than males. This striking sex difference in processing unpredictable threats in rodent FPS might help to understand the mechanisms underlying higher incidence of PTSD in women.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMale and female rats have comparable startle amplitudes when corrected for body weight\nC_LIO_LIFemale rats show higher foot-shock reactivity than males during fear-conditioning\nC_LIO_LIFemale rats show reduced fear discrimination vs. males in the classic FPS\nC_LIO_LIReversed signal-threat order increases contextual fear in both sexes\nC_LIO_LIExposure to unpredictable threats increases startle in general and contextual fear only in females\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection elicits both protein and lipid antigen-specific T cell responses. However, the incorporation of lipid antigens into subunit vaccine strategies and formulations has been underexplored, and the characteristics of vaccine-induced Mtb lipid-specific memory T cells have remained elusive. Mycolic acid (MA), a major lipid component of the Mtb cell wall, is presented by human CD1b molecules to unconventional T cell subsets. These MA-specific CD1b-restricted T cells have been detected in the blood and disease sites of Mtb-infected individuals, suggesting that MA is a promising lipid antigen for incorporation into multicomponent subunit vaccines. In this study, we utilized the enhanced stability of bicontinuous nanospheres (BCN) to efficiently encapsulate MA for in vivo delivery to MA-specific T cells, both alone and in combination with an immunodominant Mtb protein antigen (Ag85B). Pulmonary administration of MA-loaded BCN (MA-BCN) elicited MA-specific T cell responses in humanized CD1 transgenic mice. Simultaneous delivery of MA and Ag85B within BCN activated both MA- and Ag85B-specific T cells. Notably, pulmonary vaccination with MA-Ag85B-BCN resulted in the persistence of MA, but not Ag85B, within alveolar macrophages in the lung. Vaccination of MA-BCN through intravenous or subcutaneous route, or with attenuated Mtb likewise reproduced MA persistence. Moreover, MA-specific T cells in MA-BCN-vaccinated mice differentiated into a T follicular helper-like phenotype. Overall, the BCN platform allows for the dual encapsulation and in vivo activation of lipid and protein antigen-specific T cells and leads to persistent lipid depots that could offer long-lasting immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Global demand for wood products is increasing forest harvest. One understudied consequence of logging is that it accelerates mobilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from soils to aquatic ecosystems. Here, we tested how logging changed DOM in headwaters of hardwood-dominated catchments in northern Ontario, Canada. We apply a before-after control-impact experiment across four catchments for three years. DOM concentration in streams from logged catchments quadrupled, on average, after the first year post-harvest, but resulting changes to the molecular composition of DOM persisted for at least two-years. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry revealed that DOM within logged catchments was more energy-rich and chemically diverse than in controls, with novel highly unsaturated polyphenols, carboxylic-rich alicyclic, and nitrogen-containing formulae. The molecular composition of stream DOM measured fortnightly post-harvest was most strongly associated with DOM composition within intermediate and deeper layers of contributing soils, likely due to increased hydrological connectivity post-harvest. We estimate logging increased the total annual flux of dissolved organic carbon in streams by 6.4% of extracted wood carbon, and this carbon was more likely to be released into the atmosphere. Carbon accounting of forestry, including as a natural climate solution, must now consider the transport and fate of DOM from land into water.",

    "abstract": "Demographic models of Latin American populations often fail to fully capture their complex evolutionary history, which has been shaped by both recent admixture and deeper-in-time demographic events. To address this gap, we used high-coverage whole genome data from Indigenous American ancestries in present-day Mexico and existing genomes from across Latin America to infer multiple demographic models that capture the impact of different timescales on genetic diversity. Our approach, which combines analyses of allele frequencies and ancestry tract length distributions, represents a significant improvement over current models in predicting patterns of genetic variation in admixed Latin American populations. We jointly modeled the contribution of European, African, East Asian, and Indigenous American ancestries into present-day Latin American populations to capture the historical demographic events that have shaped genetic variation. Our inferred demographic histories are consistent across different genomic regions and annotations, suggesting that our inferences are robust to the potential effects of linked selection. In conjunction with published distributions of fitness effects for new nonsynonymous mutations in humans, we show in large-scale simulations that our models recover important features of both neutral and deleterious variation. By providing a more realistic framework for understanding the evolutionary history of Latin American populations, our models can help address the historical under-representation of admixed groups in genomics research, and can be a valuable resource for future studies of populations with complex admixture and demographic histories.",

    "abstract": "Microbial collectives - communities of microbes of the same or different species - can carry out functions that are often not achievable by individual microbes in isolation. Examples of collective functions include waste degradation, food fermentation, and vitamin production that are beneficial to humans. A human-desired collective function might be achieved by artificial selection on collectives. However, such selection on collectives is challenging due to the lack of theoretical understanding. Here, we examine a simple microbial system to develop a theoretical approach for understanding the conditions for successful artificial selection on collectives. In each selection cycle, multiple low-density \"Newborn\" collectives with wild and mutant cells are allowed to \"mature\" during which cells grow and possibly mutate. At the end of a cycle, \"Adult\" collective with the highest function is selected and is split into multiple Newborns for the next cycle. Repeating selection cycles, we aim to obtain the target composition that gives an optimal collective function. Investigating the possibility to get closer the target composition through artificial selection, we predict whether the selection is successful at given experimental setups. This approach allows us to find which experimental parameters are important for successful selection. Our results show that small bottleneck sizes play an important role while the effect of increasing collective numbers is not always significant.",

    "abstract": "C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), also known as DNA damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3), is a member of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family. The expression of CHOP is upregulated during unfolded protein response (UPR), and sustained CHOP activity plays an important role in UPR-induced apoptosis. MicroRNA-616 is localized in an intron of the CHOP gene. However, regulation of miR-616 expression during UPR and its function in breast cancer is not clearly understood. We show that miR-5p/-3p arms of miR-616 are expressed with levels of 5p arm higher than 3p arm. During conditions of UPR, the expression of miR-5p and miR-3p arms of miR-616 and its host gene (CHOP) was concordantly increased primarily in a PERK-dependent manner. We show that ectopic expression of miR-616 significantly suppressed cell growth and colony formation, whereas knockout of miR-616 increased it. We identified that MYC proto-oncogene (c-MYC) gene is repressed during the UPR and targeted by miR-616. Further, we show that expression of miR-616 and CHOP is downregulated in human breast cancer, where expression of miR-616 was associated with poor overall survival (OS) in luminal A subtype and better OS HER2 subtype of breast cancer. In summary, our results suggest a dual function for the DDIT3 locus, where CHOP protein and miR-616 can co-operate to regulate cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "Protein kinase CK2 activity is implicated in the pathogenesis of various hematological malignancies like Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) that remains challenging concerning treatment. Consequently, here we used Illumina HT-12 microarray gene RNA expression profiling to study the molecular events that might support the anti-leukemic effect of CIGB-300 peptide which targets both CK2 substrates and the CK2 catalytic subunits on HL-60 and OCI-AML3 cell lines. As a result, 185 and 812 genes appeared significantly modulated in HL-60 cells at 30 min and 3 h of incubation with CIGB-300 for p< 0.01 and FC>[boxv]1.5[boxv], respectively; while 222 and 332 genes appeared modulated in OCI-AML3 cells. Importantly, functional enrichment analysis evidenced that genes and transcription factors related to apoptosis, cell cycle, leukocyte differentiation, signaling by cytokines/interleukins, and NF-kB, TNF signaling pathways were significantly represented in AML cells transcriptomic profiles. The influence of CIGB-300 on these biological processes and pathways is dependent on the cellular background, in first place, and treatment duration. Of note, the impact of the peptide on NF-kB signaling was corroborated by the quantification of selected NF-kB target genes, as well as the measurement of p50 binding activity and soluble TNF- induction. Quantification of CSF1/M-CSF and CDKN1A/P21 by PCR supports peptide effects on differentiation and cell cycle. Overall, here we explore for the first time the temporal dynamics of the gene expression profile regulated by CIGB-300 and provide fresh molecular clues concerning the antineoplastic effect of CIGB-300 in two relevant AML backgrounds.",

    "abstract": "Loss of cell polarity and tissue disorganization occurs in majority of epithelial cancers. Studies in simple model organisms identified molecular mechanisms responsible for the establishment and maintenance of cellular polarity, which play a pivotal role in establishing proper tissue architecture. The exact role of these cell polarity pathways in mammalian cancer is not completely understood. Here we analyzed the mammalian orthologs of drosophila apical-basal polarity gene lethal giant larvae (lgl), which regulates asymmetric stem cell division and functions as a tumor suppressor in flies. There are two mammalian orthologs of lgl (Llgl1 and Llgl2). To determine the role of the entire lgl signaling pathway in mammals we generated mice with ablation of both Llgl1 and Llgl2 in skin epidermis using K14-Cre (Llgl1/2-/- cKO mice). Surprisingly, we found that ablation of Llgl1/2 genes does not impact epidermal polarity in adult mice. However, old Llgl1/2 cKO mice present with focal skin lesions which are missing epidermal layer and ripe with inflammation. To determine the role of lgl signaling pathway in cancer we generated Trp53-/-/Llgl1/2-/- cKO and Trp53-/+/Llgl1/2-/- cKO mice. Loss of Llgl1/2 promoted squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) development in Trp53-/- cKO and caused SCC in Trp53-/+ cKO mice, while no cancer was observed in Trp53-/+ cKO controls. Mechanistically, we show that ablation of Llgl1/2 causes activation of aPKC and upregulation of NF-kB signaling pathway, which may be necessary for SCC in Trp53-/+/Llgl1/2-/- cKO mice. We conclude that Lgl signaling pathway functions as a tumor suppressor in mammalian skin epidermis.",

    "abstract": "Vocalization behavior in birds, especially songs, strongly affects reproduction, but it is also highly impacted by geographic distance, climate, and time. For this reason, phenotypic differences in vocalizations between different bird populations are often interpreted as evidence of lineage divergence. Previous work has demonstrated that there is extensive variation in the songs of White-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys) throughout the species range, including between neighboring (and genetically distinct) subspecies Z. l. nuttalli and Z. l. pugetensis. However, it is unknown whether the divergence in their songs correlates to environmental or geographical factors. Previous work has been hindered by time-consuming traditional methods to study bird songs that rely on the manual annotation of song spectrograms into individual syllables. Here we explore the performance of automated machine learning methods of song annotation, which can process large datasets more efficiently, paying attention to the question of subspecies differences. We utilize a recently published artificial neural network to automatically annotate hundreds of White-crowned Sparrow vocalizations across two subspecies. By analyzing differences in syllable usage and composition, we find that Z. l. nuttalli and Z. l. pugetensis have significantly different songs. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that these differences are caused by the changes in syllables in the White-crowned Sparrow repertoire. However, the large sample size enabled by the AI approach allows us to demonstrate that divergence in song is correlated with environmental difference and migratory status, but not with geographical distance. Our findings support the hypothesis that the evolution of vocalization behavior is affected by environment, in addition to population structure.\n\nLAY SUMMARYO_LIBirdsong is an important behavior because it is important in bird communication and reproduction.\nC_LIO_LIWhite-crowned Sparrows in western North America are known to use different songs along their range, but it is unknown if those songs vary due to the environment.\nC_LIO_LIWe used machine learning to analyze these songs and found that populations of White-crowned Sparrows can be differentiated based on their songs.\nC_LIO_LIEnvironmental factors during the breeding season exert a greater influence on song evolution in migratory subspecies.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Nutrition is an important determinant of an animals survival and fitness. Phenotypic plasticity allows a genotype to adjust life history traits to changes in its nutritional environment, and it varies among individuals. The origin of this variation comes from differences in proximate mechanisms regulating trait expression. To understand how variation in plasticity is achieved, we made use of a Drosophila melanogaster isogenic panel to characterize nutritional plasticity for fecundity by feeding flies diets differing in their yeast content and counting the number of eggs produced. We then identified lines with the highest and lowest plastic responses to diet, and dissected the potential proximate mechanisms responsible for these differences in plasticity, including morphology, behaviour, and physiology. Our results suggest that variation in plasticity is not due to differences in ovariole number, but due to both increased food intake, and higher efficiency at converting food into eggs. Our results show that, in this population of D. melanogaster, variation in behaviour and physiology, but not morphology, underlies differences in plasticity for fecundity. Further, they set the stage for future studies aiming to understand how the proximate mechanisms that generate genetic variation in plasticity contribute to a populations persistence when faced with environmental changes.",

In this study, we aimed to characterize the temporal landscape of A-to-I editing in mouse retina development using total RNA-seq and Ribosome profiling, with a specific emphasis on its effect on gene translation. Our findings revealed that the editing underwent plastic changes and distinct editing contents facilitated stage-specific functions. Further analysis showed a dynamic interplay between A-to-I editing and alternative splicing, with A-to-I editing having a significant impact on splicing efficiency and increasing the quantity of splicing events. A-to-I editing held the potential of enhancing the translatomes diversity, but this came at the expense of reduced translational efficiency. When coupled with splicing, it could produce a coordinated regulatory effect on translatome dynamics. Overall, our study presents a temporally resolved atlas of A-to-I editing, connecting its dynamic changes with the regulatory impact on splicing and translation.",

    "abstract": "Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oral disease has increased during the era of HIV antiretroviral therapy. HPV and HIV proteins may be co-present at mucosal surfaces. Recent published studies have determined that HIVtat is secreted in the saliva and has been detected in oral mucosa even in the context of antiretroviral therapy. We hypothesized that HIVtat promoted oral HPV pathogenesis. Clinical HPV16 cloned episomes were introduced into differentiated oral epithelial cells (OKF6tert1). HIVtat mediated transactivation, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and effects on cellular differentiation were assessed. Detection of keratin 10 and of loricrin confirmed terminal differentiation. Sodium butyrate-treated (NaB) cells demonstrated an eight-fold increase in cross-linked involucrin, suggesting full terminal differentiation. HIVtat modulated this differentiation both in the presence and absence of NaB. Later viral events, including E6* and E1^E4 gene expression were assessed. HIVtat mediated relief of repressed L1 expression that mapped to a known inhibitory region (nucleotides 5561-6820). Viruses from HIVtat co-expressing cells exhibited robust de novo HPV16 infection. In conclusion, a novel oral keratinocyte monolayer system supported replication of an HPV16 clinical isolate where direct HIVtat and oral HPV interactions enhanced HPV de novo infection.",

    "abstract": "There have been theories presented on Azolla cyanobionts, known for voracious nitrogen fixation, vertical transmission of cyanobiont and helping transform a greenhouse planet to an icehouse one ~49 Mya. One such theory encapsulates the existence of two cyanobionts, named Major and Minor. We show here the identity of a possible minor cyanobiont of Azolla named Fischerella uthpalarensis. A likely cyanobiont with straight or curved filaments that were truly branched was isolated. Seven gene fragments, namely 16s rDNA (Forward and Reverse), RNA Polymerase, ITS1 region (Forward and Reverse), nifD and GroEL genes were utilized to identify the isolated cyanobiont. The best match based on BLASTn search tool was found in the RNA Polymerase beta subunit (rpoC) gene fragment, that showed 99.54% identity with 55% coverage to Fischerella muscicola. Phylogenetic inferences with the rpoC genetic locus and the GroEL protein sequence suggest a likely Fischerella genus identity. Furthermore, VnfDG and VnfN fragments too were amplified using PCR and sequenced to demonstrate that this cyanobiont has alternate nitrogenase genes, on top of the molybdenum counterpart, providing an advantage in lifestyle. We encountered a higher level of genomic-level synonymous substitutions, which was not reflected in protein sequences, namely VnfDG and VnfN gene products, which may be due to codon heterogeneity. We also propose for F. uthpalarensis atypicality in codon usage due to the likely acquisition of the V-nitrogenase operon from a presumed recent horizontal gene transfer (HGT) event. The cyanobiont from this study showcases a higher preference for AT over GC at the VnfDG composite locus again hinting at a symbiotic lifestyle.",

    "abstract": "Investigations on symbiotic associations between Lepidoptera and bacteria have been inconclusive as to whether these microorganisms represent transient or persistent associations. One reason for this is that most studies have sampled the microbiota from only a few species and frequently from laboratory-reared animals. We sequenced the 16S rRNA gene to profile the gut microbiome of the field collected, agricultural pests Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera frugiperda. We found that variation in the structure of bacterial communities is in great part associated with their host diet. Moreover, Enterococcus, among a few other taxa, is consistently present in all samples regardless of the plant hosts were collected. The larval gut bacteria composition matches previously published data in the same or related species, indicating that associations with bacteria taxa such as Enterococcus are persistent despite geographical variation and sampling techniques. Based on our phylogenetic analysis it is not clear, however, if Enterococci associated with Lepidoptera are necessarily different from environmental bacteria. We conclude that to fully understand the nature of Lepidoptera - gut bacteria associations it will be necessary to conduct larger sampling efforts and combine them with identification methods of bacterial strains that go beyond screening of the 16S rRNA gene.",

Here, 15 new deeply-rooted thaumarchaeotal genomes were assembled from acidic topsoils (0-15cm) and subsoils (30-60 cm), most of them corresponding to two genera of terrestrially prevalent Gagatemarchaeaceae (previously known as thaumarchaeotal Group I.1c). Unlike previous predictions, metabolic annotations suggest Gagatemarchaeaceae perform aerobic respiration and use various organic carbon sources. Evolutionary speciation between topsoil and subsoil lineages happened early in Gagatemarchaeaceae history, with significant metabolic and genomic trait differences. Reconstruction of the evolutionary mechanisms showed that the genome expansion in topsoil Gagatemarchaeaceae resulted from extensive early lateral gene acquisition, followed by progressive gene duplication throughout evolutionary history. Ancestral trait reconstruction using the expanded genomic diversity also refuted the previous hypothesis of a Thaumarchaeota thermophilic ancestor. Ultimately, this study provides an attractive model for studying mechanisms driving niche partitioning between spatially related ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Flavivirus NS5 is multi-functional viral protein that play critical roles in virus replication, evolution, and immune antagonism against the hosts. Its error-prone replicase activity copies viral RNA for progeny virus particles and shapes virus evolution. Its methyltransferase activity and STAT2-targeting activity compromise type-I interferon signalling, dampening protective immune response during infection. It interacts with several host factors to shape the host-cell environment for virus replication. Thus, NS5 represents a critical target for both vaccine and antiviral drug development. Here, we performed deep mutational scanning (DMS) on the NS5 of dengue virus serotype 2 in mammalian cells. In combination with available structural and biochemical data, the comprehensive single amino-acid mutational data corroborated key residues and interactions involved in enzymatic functions of the replicase and suggested potential plasticity in NS5 guanylyl transferase. Strikingly, we identified that a set of strictly conserved residues in the motifs lining the replicase active site could tolerate mutations, suggesting additional roles of the priming loop in viral RNA synthesis and possible strategies to modulate the error rate of viral replicase activity through active-site engineering. Our DMS dataset and NS5 libraries could provide a framework and a resource to investigate molecular, evolutionary, and immunological aspects of NS5 functions, with relevance to vaccine and antiviral drug development.",

    "abstract": "Human Papillomavirus (HPV) associated oral disease continues to increase, both in the context of immune competence and of immune suppression. There are few models of oral HPV infection and current models are laborious. We hypothesized that differentiated oral epithelial cells could support the HPV life cycle. Clinical HPV16 cloned episomes were introduced into differentiated oral epithelial cells (OKF6tert1). Viral and cellular gene expression was assessed in the presence or absence of sodium butyrate, a differentiating agent that moved the cells to full terminal differentiation. Detection of keratin 10, cross-linked involucrin, and loricrin in the presence and absence of sodium butyrate confirmed terminal differentiation. Increasing sodium butyrate concentrations in the absence of HPV, were associated with decreased suprabasal markers and increased terminal differentiation markers. However, in the presence of HPV and of increasing sodium butyrate concentrations, both mitotic and suprabasal markers were increased and the terminal differentiation marker, loricrin, decreased. In this unique differentiated state, early and late viral gene products were detected including spliced mRNAs for E6*, E1^E4, and L1. E7 and L1 proteins were detected. The ratio of late (E1^E4) to early (E6/E7) transcripts in HPV16+ OKF6tert1 cells was distinct compared to HPV16+ C33a cells. Consistent with permissive HPV replication, DNA damage responses (phospho-chk2, gamma-H2AX), HPV E2-dependent LCR transactivation, and DNase-resistant particles were detected and visualized by transmission electron microscopy. In sum, monolayers of differentiated immortalized oral epithelial cells supported the full HPV life cycle. HPV may optimize the differentiation state of oral epithelial cells to facilitate its replication.",

Using a newly created fish line with a mutation in the protease core, we show for the first time that the proteolytic function of Acrc is critical for DPCR during early vertebrate development and that Acrc deficiency leads to DPC accumulation and embryonic death. We also show that Sprt domain rather than IDR domain of Acrc is essential and that Sprtn protease cannot compensate for the absence of Acrc. We identified histone H3-DPC as a novel Acrc substrate.",

    "abstract": "Many nocturnally active fireflies use precisely timed bioluminescent patterns to identify mates, making them especially vulnerable to light pollution. As urbanization continues to brighten the night sky, firefly populations are under constant stress, and close to half of the species are now threatened. Ensuring the survival of firefly biodiversity depends on a large-scale conservation effort to monitor and protect thousands of populations. While species can be identified by their flash patterns, current methods require expert measurement and manual classification and are infeasible given the number and geographic distribution of fireflies. Here we present the application of a recurrent neural network (RNN) for accurate automated firefly flash pattern classification. Using recordings from commodity cameras, we can extract flash trajectories of individuals within a swarm and classify their species with a precision and recall of approximately seventy percent. In addition to scaling population monitoring, automated classification provides the means to study firefly behavior at the population level. We employ the classifier to measure and characterize the variability within and between swarms, unlocking a new dimension of their behavior. Our method is open source, and deployment in community science applications could revolutionize our ability to monitor and understand firefly populations.",

    "abstract": "Molecular dissection of meiotic recombination in mammals, combined with population-genetic and comparative studies, have revealed a complex evolutionary dynamics characterized by short-lived recombination hot-spots, highly suggestive of an intra-genomic Red Queen. At the center of this exceptional dynamics is a key gene, Prdm9. Initially discovered for its role in hybrid sterility, Prdm9 was subsequently recognized to have a double molecular function during meiosis, first recruiting the double strand break machinery and thus determining the location of hot spots; second, facilitating the pairing of homologous chromosomes. This latter function requires symmetric binding of Prdm9 (on both homologues). However, in many respects, the evolutionary mechanisms underlying this complex dynamics are still poorly understood. Here, we present a theoretical model of the evolutionary dynamics of meiotic recombination integrating current knowledge about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our modeling work gives important insights into the evolutionary dynamics of recombination. Most importantly, a Red Queen spontaneously emerges as an outcome of the interplay between the dual molecular functions of PRDM9. Thus, on one side, hot spots are eroded by biased gene conversion, itself a result of the recruitment of the double-strand break machinery by Prdm9. On the other side, the reduced symmetrical binding of Prdm9 caused by the loss of high affinity binding sites induces a net positive selection eliciting new Prdm9 alleles recognizing new targets. The model also offers new insights about the influence of the genetic dosage of PRDM9 on the dynamics of the Red Queen, which can paradoxically result in negative selection on new PRDM9 alleles entering the population. Finally, calibrating the model based on current empirical knowledge shows there is no need for much more realism in our model to correctly fit the empirical data.",

    "abstract": "The era of inexpensive genome sequencing and improved bioinformatics tools has reenergized the study of natural products, including the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). In recent years, RiPP discovery has challenged preconceptions about the scope of post-translational modification chemistry, but genome mining of new RiPP classes remains an unsolved challenge. Here, we report a RiPP class defined by an unusual (S)-N2,N2-dimethyl-1,2-propanediamine (Dmp)-modified C-terminus, which we term the daptides. Nearly 500 daptide biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were identified by analyzing the RiPP Recognition Element (RRE), a common substrate-binding domain found in half of prokaryotic RiPP classes. A representative daptide BGC from Microbacterium paraoxydans DSM 15019 was selected for experimental characterization. Derived from a C-terminal threonine residue, the class-defining Dmp is installed over three steps by an oxidative decarboxylase, aminotransferase, and methyltransferase. Daptides uniquely harbor two positively charged termini, and thus we suspect this modification could aid in membrane targeting, as corroborated by hemolysis assays. Our studies further show that the oxidative decarboxylation step requires a functionally unannotated accessory protein. Fused to the C-terminus of the accessory protein is an RRE domain, which delivers the unmodified substrate peptide to the oxidative decarboxylase. This discovery of a class-defining post-translational modification in RiPPs may serve as a prototype for unveiling additional RiPP classes through genome mining.",

    "abstract": "Histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) epigenetically silences gene expression by forming heterochromatin. Proteins called HP1, which contain specialized reader domains, bind to H3K9me and recruit factors that regulate epigenetic silencing. Though these interactions have been identified in vitro, we do not understand how HP1 proteins specifically and selectively bind to heterochromatin-associated factors within the nucleus. Using fission yeast as a model system, we measured the single-molecule dynamics associated with two archetypal HP1 paralogs, Swi6 and Chp2, and inferred how they form complexes with their interacting partners: Epe1, a putative H3K9 demethylase; Clr3, a histone deacetylase; and Mit1, a chromatin remodeler. Through a series of genetic perturbations that affect H3K9 methylation and HP1-mediated recruitment, we were able to track altered diffusive properties associated with each HP1 protein and its binding partner. Our findings show that the HP1-interacting proteins we investigated only co-localize with Swi6 and Chp2 at sites of H3K9me. When H3K9me is absent, Epe1 and Swi6 exhibit diffusive states consistent with off-chromatin interactions. Our results suggest that histone modifications like H3K9 methylation are not simply inert binding platforms but rather, they can shift the balance of HP1 complex assembly toward a predominantly chromatin-bound state. By inferring protein-protein interactions based on the altered mobilities of proteins in living cells, we propose that H3K9 methylation can stimulate the assembly of diverse HP1-associated complexes on chromatin.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDuring differentiation, epigenetic silencing is essential for preserving cellular identity. Establishing and maintaining epigenetic silencing depends on histone H3 lysine 9 methylation, which HP1 proteins recognize and bind with low micromolar affinity and millisecond-scale kinetics. HP1 proteins also recruit diverse histone modifiers to maintain gene silencing. HP1 protein biochemistry has revealed what can happen, but the state-of-the-art in this field includes little about what does happen in the complex and crowded environment of the nucleus. Using single-molecule tracking of HP1 proteins and their binding partners, we identified the rules that govern their complex formation in the native chromatin context, and we found that chromatin-- previously thought to be an inert platform--enhances complex formation between HP1 and its binding partners.",

    "abstract": "Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most frequent form of paediatric soft-tissue sarcoma and remains a medical challenge, holding in failure current therapeutic strategies. RMS shares histological features with cells of the muscle lineage and this cancer is thought to arise from malignant transformation of myogenic precursors. It has been proposed that RMS and myogenesis could represent the \"Jekyll and Hyde\" of skeletal muscle. The underlying idea is that some early steps of myogenic differentiation are blocked in RMS, and that understanding how the normal process has gone awry could help to decipher the biological underpinnings of tumorigenesis and tumor escape.\n\nIt is widely agreed that extracellular matrix (ECM) interferes in skeletal muscle regeneration and that defects in ECM components are clinically significant. The challenge is now to decipher actors and mechanisms responsible for the transmission of signals to muscle cells and the subsequent alterations that could be associated with RMS.\n\nUsing an original transgenic mice model, we show here that ADAMTSL1 is involved in skeletal muscle regeneration. As previously reported for other members of its family, ADAMTSL1 is part of the TGF-{beta}-ECM-sequestering complex and likely positively regulates TGF-{beta}-pathway activity. Last, we observed that ADAMTSL1 expression behaves as a strong prognostic factor in the aggressive fusion-positive RMS and correlates with a neural-like phenotype of tumor cells, resulting from gain of SMAD2/3/4 targets.",

    "abstract": "1Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been identified as a novel alternative to classical diagnostic imaging. Over the last several decades, many studies have been conducted to determine possible CEST agents, such as endogenously expressed compounds or proteins, that can be utilized to produce contrast with minimally invasive procedures and reduced or non-existent levels of toxicity. In recent years there has been an increased interest in the generation of genetically engineered CEST contrast agents, typically based on existing proteins with CEST contrast or modified to produce CEST contrast. We have developed an in-silico method for the evolution of peptide sequences to optimize CEST contrast and showed that these peptides could be combined to create de novo biosensors for CEST MRI. A single protein, superCESTide 2.0, was designed to be 198 amino acids. SuperCESTide 2.0 was expressed in E. coli and purified with size-exclusion chromatography. The magnetic transfer ratio asymmetry (MTRasym) generated by superCESTide 2.0 was comparable to levels seen in previous CEST reporters, such as protamine sulfate (salmon protamine, SP), Poly-L-Lysine (PLL), and human protamine (hPRM1). This data shows that novel peptides with sequences optimized in silico for CEST contrast that utilizes a more comprehensive range of amino acids can still produce contrast when assembled into protein units expressed in complex living environments.",

    "abstract": "Immune cells sense their microenvironment to fine-tune their inflammatory responses. Patients with cryopyrin associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), caused by mutations in the NLRP3 gene, present auto-inflammation. However, its manifestation is largely dependent on environmental cues through so far unknown mechanisms. Here, we link PIEZO-mediated mechanotransduction to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Yoda1, a PIEZO1 agonist, dramatically lowers the threshold for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. PIEZO-mediated stiffness-sensing increases NLRP3-dependent inflammatory responses. Activation of PIEZO1 triggers calcium influx, which activates KCNN4, a calcium-activated potassium channel, to evoke potassium efflux promoting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Activation of PIEZO1 is sufficient to activate the inflammasome in cells expressing CAPS-causing NLRP3 mutants in a KCNN4-dependent manner. We thus propose that PIEZO-dependent mechanosensing is essential for triggering auto-inflammation in CAPS.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryPIEZO-dependent mechanotransduction stimulates KCNN4-dependent potassium efflux to potentiate NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",

Here, we investigated the role of the inflammasome-activated pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) during infection. Ablation of GSDMD in knockout (KO) mice significantly attenuated virus-induced weight loss, lung dysfunction, lung histopathology, and mortality compared with wild type (WT) mice, despite similar viral loads. Infected GSDMD KO mice exhibited decreased inflammatory gene signatures revealed by lung transcriptomics, which also implicated a diminished neutrophil response. Importantly, neutrophil depletion in infected WT mice recapitulated the reduced mortality and lung inflammation observed in GSDMD KO animals, while having no additional protective effects in GSDMD KOs. These findings reveal a new function for GSDMD in promoting lung neutrophil responses that amplify influenza virus-induced inflammation and pathogenesis. Targeting the GSDMD/neutrophil axis may provide a new therapeutic avenue for treating severe influenza.",

Since the discovery of Pithovirus sibericum, recovered from a 30,000-y-old permafrost sample, other pithoviruses, and related cedratviruses, were isolated from various terrestrial and aquatic samples. Here we report the isolation and genome sequencing of two strains of Pithoviridae from soil samples, in addition to three other recent isolates. Using the 12 available genome sequences, we conducted a thorough comparative genomics study of the Pithoviridae family to decipher the organization and evolution of their genomes. Our study reveals a non-uniform genome organization in two main regions: one concentrating core genes, and another gene duplications. We also found that Pithoviridae genomes are more conservative than other families of giant viruses, with a low and stable proportion (5% to 7%) of genes originating from horizontal transfers. Genome size variation within the family is mainly due to variations in gene duplication rates (from 14% to 28%) and massive invasion by miniature inverted-repeats transposable elements (MITEs). While these repeated elements are absent from cedratviruses, repeat-rich regions cover as much as a quarter of the pithoviruses genomes. These regions, identified using a dedicated pipeline, are hotspots of mutations, gene capture events and genomic rearrangements, that likely contribute to their evolution.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveDeterioration of oral hygiene is closely related to increase severity and mortality of corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19), and also contribute to the development of various diseases such as aspiration pneumonia or Alzheimers. Oral care is attracting high interest in Japan, which has entered a super-aging society. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether commercially available Hinora(R) (HO) that oral care gels-containing hinokitiol and 4-isopropyl-3-methylphenol (IPMP) have biofilm formation inhibitory and antibacterial activities against various intraoral pathogen microorganisms.\n\nMethodCandida spp., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were selected during the study period, all which were analyzed using antimicrobial disc, microorganism turbidity, and crystal violet assays. In addition, the germ tube test using C. albicans was performed with a modification of Mackenzies method. Images for morphological observation of the germ tubes were acquired with an inverted microscope. For comparison between products, we used Refrecare(R) (RC), which contains only hinokitiol (not containing IPMP).\n\nResultsAll the intraoral pathogenic microorganisms showed drug susceptibility against undiluted form HO and/or RC. In particular, HO was more effective at lower concentrations than RC. In the HO-added group, inhibition circles were observed in all bacteria except P. aeruginosa when added at a concentration of 0.5 g/mL or more. The optical density values at 590 nm (crystal violet) and/or 600 nm (microorganism turbidity) of all the fungi and bacteria were significantly lower when cultured in medium with HO. Inhibition of growth or biofilm formation was observed when HO was added at a concentration of 0.05 g/mL or higher. To investigate the action mechanism of HO, germ tube tests were performed in C. albicans. The results show that culturing C. albicans in soyabean-casein digest broth with HO (0.05 g/mL) significantly suppressed germ tube formation.\n\nConclusionsThese data suggest that oral care gel-containing hinokitiol and IPMP has strong biofilm formation inhibitory, antifungal and antibacterial effects against Candida fungi and multiple intraoral pathogenic microorganisms. Therefore, it may be a promising treatment option for oral infections.",

    "abstract": "Biofilms are bacterial communities that result from a cell differentiation process that leads to the secretion of an extracellular matrix (ECM) by part of the bacterial population. In Bacillus subtilis, the main protein component of the ECM is the functional amyloid TasA, which forms a fiber-based scaffold that confers structure to the ECM. The N-terminal half of TasA is strongly conserved among Bacillus species and contains a protein domain, the amyloid core (AcTasA), which is critical for the formation of the amyloid architecture. In this study, we demonstrate that recombinantly purified AcTasA in vitro retains biochemical properties previously observed for the entire protein. Further analysis of the AcTasA amino acid sequence revealed two amyloidogenic stretches and a region of imperfect amino acid repeats, which are known to contribute to functional amyloid assembly. Biochemical characterization of these amyloidogenic stretches found in AcTasA revealed their amyloid capacity in vitro, contributing to the amyloid nature of AcTasA. Moreover, the study of the imperfect amino acid repeats revealed the critical role of residues D64, K68 and D69 in the structural function of TasA. In vivo and in vitro experiments with versions of TasA carrying the substitutions D64A, K68A, and D69A demonstrated a partial loss of function of the protein either in the assembly of the ECM or in the stability of the core and amyloid polymerization. Taken together, our findings allow us to better understand the polymerization process of TasA during biofilm formation and provide knowledge into the sequence determinants that promote the molecular behavior of functional amyloids.",

Using specific guide RNAs, we targeted dCas13 to the downstream region of the canonical stop codons of mammalian AGO1 and VEGFA, which are known to exhibit natural SCR. Results of readthrough assays revealed the enhancement of SCR of these mRNAs (both exogenous and endogenous) caused by dCas13. This effect was associated with ribosomal pausing, which has been reported in several SCR events. Furthermore, our results show that CRISPR-dCas13 can induce SCR across premature termination codons (PTC) in the mRNAs of green fluorescent protein and TP53. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this strategy in the induction of readthrough across the thalassemia-causing PTC in HBB mRNA. Thus, CRISPR-dCas13 can be programmed to enhance or induce SCR in a transcript-selective and stop codon-specific manner.",

A concern in this combined method (called SR-cryoCLEM), however, is whether and how fluorescence imaging prior to cryoEM acquisition is detrimental to sample integrity. In this report, we investigated the effect of high-dose laser light irradiation on apoferritin samples prepared for cryoEM with excitation wavelengths commonly used in fluorescence microscopy, and comparing these samples to controls that were kept in the dark. We found that laser illumination, of equal duration and intensity as used in super-resolution cryomicroscopy and in the presence of high concentrations of fluorescent protein, did not affect the achievable resolution in cryoEM, with final reconstructions reaching resolutions of ~1.8 [A] regardless of the illumination conditions. The finding that super-resolution fluorescence imaging of cryosamples prior to cryoEM data acquisition does not limit the achievable resolution suggests that super-resolution cryo-fluorescence microscopy and in situ structural biology using cryoEM are entirely compatible.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

The physical model of siQ-ChIP predicted that the IP step of ChIP would produce a classical binding isotherm when antibody or epitope was titrated. Here, we define experimental conditions in which this titration is observable for antibodies that recognize modified states of histone proteins. We show that minimally sequenced points along an isotherm can reveal differential binding specificities that are associated with on- and off-target epitope interactions. This work demonstrates that the interpretation of histone post-translational modification distribution from ChIP-seq data has a dependence on antibody concentration. Collectively, these studies introduce a simplified and reproducible experimental method to generate quantitative ChIP-seq data without spike-in normalization and demonstrate that histone antibody specificity can be analyzed directly in ChIP-seq experiments.",
