    "abstract": "BackgroundMorganella are opportunistic pathogens involved in various infections. In Morganella, intrinsic resistance to multiple antibiotics including colistin combined with the emergence of carbapenemase-producers (CP) strongly limits the antimicrobial armamentarium.\n\nMethodsFrom 2013 to 2021, 172 highly drug-resistant (XDR) Morganella isolates from 8 European countries and Canada, two reference strains from the Pasteur Institute collection and two susceptible isolates were characterized by WGS, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and biochemical tests. Complete genomes from Genbank (n=103) were included for genomic analysis. Intrinsic resistance mechanism to polymyxins was deciphered by combining genetic analysis with mass spectrometry on the lipid A.\n\nFindingsMorganella could be separated into 4 species named M. psychrotolerans, M. sibonii, M. morganii and a new species represented by a unique strain. Morganella morganii included two subspecies: M. morganii subsp. morganii (the most prevalent) and M. morganii subsp. intermedius. Intrinsic resistance to tetracycline and conservation of metabolic pathways correlated this refined taxonomy. CP were mostly identified among five  high-risk clones of M. morganii subsp. morganii. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) cut-off of 100 was used to decipher outbreaks involving this species. Cefepime-zidebactam and ceftazidime-avibactam were the most potent antimicrobials towards the 172 XDR Morganella spp. isolates of our collection (including 145 CP) except for metallo-{beta}-lactamase-producers. The intrinsic resistance to polymyxins corresponds to the addition of L-Ara4N on the lipid A.\n\nInterpretationThis global characterization of the widest collection of XDR Morganella spp. highlighted the need to clarify the taxonomy, deciphered intrinsic resistance mechanisms and paved the way for further genomic comparisons.\n\nFundingNone\n\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSOn January 28th 2022, we have searched for the terms \"Morganella\" and \"carbapenemase\" in all published reports available in PubMed with no language restriction. We identified a total of 43 articles and most of them (41/43) corresponded to a report of a single isolate of carbapenemase-producing Morganella morganii. Only one article aimed to decipher the antimicrobial susceptibility on a collection of Proteus, Providencia and Morganella isolated from global hospitalized patients with intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections. However, this collection only included 7 M. morganii isolates. On March 2021, when we finished the inclusions in our collection, only 104 genomes of Morganella spp. were available in the NCBI database.\n\nSince September 2021, very few reports were published on carbapenemase-producing Morganella with the exception of a study from Xiang G et al. reported 40 multi-drug resistant M. morganii isolates recovered from three hospitals in China from 2014 to 2020. Unfortunately, this collection included only two carbapenemase-producing M. morganii isolates (one OXA-48 and one IMP-1). A report of KPC-producing M. morganii in Japan and a longitudinal study of carbapemase-producing Enterobactrales in Taiwan that did not focused on Morganella.\n\nWe also searched in PubMed for the terms  Morganella sibonii\" or \"Morganella psychrotolerans\" in all published reports with no language restrictions. Our search identified a total of 20 articles. None of them was related to antimicrobial resistance and no study deciphered the Morganella spp. epidemiology on clinical isolates.\n\nAdded values of this studyThis global characterization involved the widest collection of Morganella spp. isolates ever reported (barely doubling the number of Morganella spp. genomes in Genbank). In addition, 145 isolates of this worldwide collection made of 172 multidrug resistant Morganella spp. were carbapenemase producers for which therapeutic alternatives are scarce due to intrinsic resistance to last resort molecules, such as polymyxin.\n\nFirst, we found that cefepime-zidebactam and ceftazidime-avibactam were the most potent antimicrobials towards XDR Morganella spp. isolates except for metallo-{beta}-lactamase-producers.\n\nThen, we observed that carbapenemase-encoding genes were present in different Morganella species highlighting necessary changes in the taxonomy. Morganella genus could be divided into 4 species named M. psychrotolerans, M. sibonii, M. morganii and a new species represented by a unique strain. Morganella morganii includes two subspecies: M. morganii subsp. morganii (the most prevalent) and M. morganii subsp. intermedius. We demonstrated that this refined taxonomy correlated with the intrinsic resistance to tetracycline, which was found only in M. sibonii, as well as several metabolic pathways (e.g. trehalose assimilation, type III (T3SS) and type IV secretion system (T6SS), etc....).\n\nIn addition, we highlighted five \"high-risk\" clones of carbapenemase-producing M. morganii subsp. morganii that have already disseminated worldwide. Combining whole genome sequencing (WGS) data with epidemiological investigations, we demonstrated that a cut-off of 100 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could be used to discriminate clonally-related from sporadic independent isolates. This information is of the utmost importance since WGS is now considered as the reference method to identify and follow outbreaks.\n\nThe intrinsic resistance of Morganella spp. to polymyxins was well-known but the underlying mechanism was unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the addition of L-Ara4N on the lipid A of Morganella is involved.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThe identification of \"high-risk\" clones among highly-drug resistant Morganella spp. paves the way of future investigations to better understand and hopefully limit the spread of these bugs. Additionally, our results identified new components and virulence factors of some Morganella species (e.g. T6SS and T3SS in M. sibonii) that deserve further investigation since they might be implicated in the bacterial lifestyle of this genus.",

    "abstract": "Artemisinin (ART) is a quick-killing and effective antimalarial activated by the haem derived from haemoglobin digestion. Mutations in the parasites Kelch 13 (K13) protein compromise the efficacy of this drug. Recent studies indicate an undefined role for K13 in haemoglobin uptake. Here, we show that K13 is associated with the collar that constricts cytostomal invaginations required for the parasite to ingest host cytosol. Induced mislocalisation of K13 led to the formation of atypical invaginations lacking the cytostomal ring and constricted neck normally associated with cytostomes. Moreover, the levels of haemoglobin degradation products, haem and haemozoin, are decreased when K13 is inactivated. Our findings demonstrate that K13 is required for normal formation and/or stabilisation of the cytostome, and thereby the parasites uptake of haemoglobin. This is consistent with perturbation of K13 function leading to decreased activation of ART and consequently, reduced killing.\n\nSignificance StatementArtemisinin-resistant parasites contain mutations in the gene encoding the Kelch 13 protein (K13). How K13 mutations result in artemisinin resistance is unclear. Here, we present evidence that normal K13 is required for the formation of the cytostome, a specialised parasite feeding apparatus used to endocytose host cell haemoglobin. Our results suggest that artemisinin resistance is due to a decrease in artemisinin activation brought about by a decrease in efficiency of haemoglobin uptake and consequently reduced production of haem.",

    "abstract": "While large membrane-impermeable antibiotics cannot traverse a lipid barrier, spacious importers such as TonB-dependent receptors (TBDRs) can mistakenly ferry antibiotics across the bacterial outer membrane (OM). We discovered that loss of PerA, an enigmatic {beta}-helix protein in the OM of the oligotrophic -proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus, reprograms the OM TBDR proteome from ChvT that imports the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin to an uncharacterized TBDR (BugA) that confers sensitivity to the polypeptide antibiotic bacitracin. Both antibiotics are large zinc-binding molecules that target the peptidoglycan, echoing the zinc stress response induces destabilization of PerA. Inactivation of PerA launches two conserved and interwoven envelope stress programs that remodel the OM with TBDRs, a tripartite multidrug efflux pump and periplasmic proteases. Thus, unanticipated entry routes for antibiotics emerge in stressed diderm bacteria that may be treatable with membrane impermeable antimicrobials owing to an underlying transcriptional stress response pathways coordinated by a novel type of OM regulator.",

    "abstract": "Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a double-stranded DNA gammaherpesvirus, with a poorly characterized lytic replication cycle. However, the lytic replication cycle of the alpha- and betaherpesviruses are well characterized. During lytic infection of alpha- and betaherpesviruses, the viral genome is replicated as a precursor form, which contains tandem genomes linked via terminal repeats (TRs). One genomic unit of the precursor form is packaged into a capsid and is cleaved at the TR by the terminase complex. While the alpha- and betaherpesvirus terminases are well characterized, the KSHV terminase remains poorly understood. KSHV ORF7, ORF29, and ORF67.5 are presumed to be components of the terminase complex based on their homology to other terminase proteins. We previously reported that ORF7-deficient KSHV formed numerous immature soccer ball-like capsids and failed to cleave the TRs. ORF7 interacted with ORF29 and ORF67.5, however ORF29 and ORF67.5 did not interact with each other. While these results suggested that ORF7 is important for KSHV terminase function and capsid formation, the function of ORF67.5 was completely unknown. Therefore, to analyze the function of ORF67.5, we constructed ORF67.5-deficient BAC16. ORF67.5-deficient KSHV failed to produce infectious virus, failed to cleave the TRs, and numerous soccer ball-like capsids were observed in ORF67.5-deficient KSHV-harboring cells. Furthermore, ORF67.5 promoted the interaction between ORF7 and ORF29, and ORF29 increased the interaction between ORF67.5 and ORF7. Thus, our data indicated that ORF67.5 functions as a component of the KSHV terminase complex by contributing to TR cleavage, terminase complex formation, capsid formation, and virus production.\n\nIMPORTANCEAlthough the formation and function of the alpha- and betaherpesvirus terminase complexes are well understood, the KSHV terminase complex is still largely uncharacterized. This complex presumably contains KSHV ORF7, ORF29, and ORF67.5. We were the first to report the presence of soccer ball-like capsids in ORF7-deficient KSHV-harboring lytic-induced cells. Here, we demonstrated that ORF67.5-deficient KSHV also formed the soccer ball-like capsids in lytic-induced cells. Moreover, ORF67.5 was required for TR cleavage, infectious virus production, and enhancement of the interaction between ORF7 and ORF29. ORF67.5 has several highly conserved regions among its human herpesviral homologs. These regions were necessary for virus production and for the interaction of ORF67.5 with ORF7, which was supported by the AI-predicted structure model. Importantly, our results provide the first evidence showing that ORF67.5 is essential for terminase complex formation and TR cleavage.",

    "abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes is ubiquitously found in nature and can easily enter food-processing facilities due to contaminations of raw materials. Several countermeasures are used to combat contamination of food products, for instance the use of disinfectants that contain quaternary ammonium compounds, such as benzalkonium chloride (BAC) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). In this study, we assessed the potential of the commonly used wildtype strain EGD-e to adapt to BAC and CTAB under laboratory growth conditions. All BAC-tolerant suppressors exclusively carried mutations in fepR or its promoter region likely resulting in the overproduction of the efflux pump FepA. In contrast, CTAB- tolerance was associated with mutations in sugR, which regulates the expression of the efflux pumps SugE1 and SugE2. L. monocytogenes strains lacking either FepA or SugE1/2 could still acquire tolerance towards BAC and CTAB. Genomic analysis revealed that the overproduction of the remaining efflux system could compensate for the deleted one. Even in the absence of both efflux systems, tolerant strains could be isolated, which all carried mutations in the diacylglycerol kinase encoding gene lmo1753 (dgkB). DgkB converts diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid, which is subsequently re-used for the synthesis of phospholipids suggesting that alterations in membrane composition could be the third adaptation mechanism.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementSurvival and proliferation of Listeria monocytogenes in the food industry is an ongoing concern, and while there are various countermeasures to combat contamination of food products, the pathogen still successfully manages to withstand the harsh conditions present in food-processing facilities, resulting in reoccurring outbreaks, subsequent infection, and disease. To counteract the spread of L. monocytogenes it is crucial to understand and elucidate the underlying mechanism that permit their successful evasion. We here present various adaptation mechanisms of L. monocytogenes to withstand two important quaternary ammonium compounds.",

    "abstract": "The constant arms race between bacteria and their phages has resulted in a large diversity of bacterial defence systems1,2, with many bacteria carrying several systems3,4. In response, phages often carry counter-defence genes5-9. If and how bacterial defence mechanisms interact to protect against phages with counter-defence genes remains unclear. Here, we report the existence of a novel defence system, coined MADS (Methylation Associated Defence System), which is located in a strongly conserved genomic defence hotspot in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and distributed across Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We find that the natural co-existence of MADS and a Type IE CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune system in the genome of P. aeruginosa SMC4386 provides synergistic levels of protection against phage DMS3, which carries an anti-CRISPR (acr) gene. Previous work has demonstrated that Acr-phages need to cooperate to overcome CRISPR immunity, with a first sacrificial phage causing host immunosuppression to enable successful secondary phage infections10,11. Modelling and experiments show that the co-existence of MADS and CRISPR-Cas provides strong and durable protection against Acr-phages by disrupting their cooperation and limiting the spread of mutants that overcome MADS. These data reveal that combining bacterial defences can robustly neutralise phage with counter-defence genes, even if each defence on its own can be readily by-passed, which is key to understanding how selection acts on defence combinations and their coevolutionary consequences.",

    "abstract": "Rickettsia microorganisms are causative agents of several neglected emerging infectious diseases transmitted to humans by ticks among other arthropod vectors. In this study, ticks were collected from four geographical regions of Uganda, pooled in sizes of 1-179 ticks based on location, tick species, life stage, host, and time of collection, and were tested by real time PCR for Rickettsia species harboured. The tick pools were tested with primers targeting gltA, 17kDa and ompA genes, followed by Sanger sequencing of 17kDa and ompA genes. Of the 471 tick pools tested, 116 (24.6%) were positive for Rickettsia spp. by the gltA primers. The prevalence of Rickettsia varied by district with Gulu recording the highest (30.1%) followed by Luwero (28.1%) and Kasese had the lowest (14%). Tick pools with highest positivity rates were from livestock (cattle, goats, sheep, and pigs), 26.9%, followed by vegetation 23.1% and pets (dogs and cats) 19.7%. Of 116 gltA-positive tick pools, 86 pools were positive using 17kDa primers of which 48 purified PCR products were successfully sequenced. The predominant Rickettsia spp. identified was R. africae (n=15) in four tick species, followed by R. conorii (n=5) in three tick species (Haemaphysalis elliptica, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, and Rh. decoloratus). Rickettsia conorii subsp. israelensis was detected in one tick pool. These findings indicate that multiple Rickettsia spp. capable of causing human illness are circulating in the four diverse geographical regions of Uganda including new strains previously known to occur in the Mediterranean region. Physicians should be informed about Rickettsia spp. infections as potential causes for acute febrile illnesses in these regions. Continued and expanded surveillance is essential to further identify and locate potential hotspots with Rickettsia spp. of concern.\n\nAuthor SummaryTick-borne rickettsioses are emerging infectious diseases of public health importance worldwide. Spotted fever rickettsioses transmitted by ticks can cause mild to severe human illness depending on the Rickettsia spp. and co-morbidities. Their diagnosis is challenging due to non-specific symptoms particularly in limited resource settings. Little is known about their prevalence in Uganda. Using entomological and molecular tools, we surveyed and studied tick-borne spotted fever rickettsioses in five districts from four diverse eco-regions of Uganda. Overall, 24.6% (116/471) tick pools were positive for Rickettsia species. By sequencing the 17kDa and ompA genes of Rickettsia, we identified R. africae as the most common agent, followed by R. conorii and R. conorii subsp. israelensis. The findings indicate multiple Rickettsia spp. that can cause febrile illness in humans are circulating in the four geographically diverse regions of Uganda. Physicians should be aware these agents are potential causes of febrile illness in these areas, particularly in individuals who encounter livestock or their grazing areas.",

    "abstract": "Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a tumor-suppressive mechanism that arrests cell proliferation in response to oncogene-induced replication stress (RS). OIS also depends on the cGAS-STING pathway, which detects cytosolic DNA and promotes the expression of type I interferons (IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Whether and how the RS and IFN responses cooperate to promote OIS is currently unknown. Here, we show that the MRE11 nuclease promotes OIS in immortalized human fibroblasts overexpressing the H-RASV12 oncogene both by slowing replication forks and by activating the cGAS-STING pathway in response to RS. Interestingly, overexpression of TREX1, the major nuclease degrading cytosolic DNA, prevented RAS-induced senescence. In contrast, overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of TREX1 was sufficient to induce senescence in human fibroblasts, even in the absence of H-RASV12 induction. Collectively, these data suggest that the RS and IFN responses in OIS are functionally linked through a process involving the nucleases MRE11 and TREX1.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA), which carries an enormous disease burden across the world, is characterised by irreversible degeneration of articular cartilage (AC), and subsequently bone. The cellular cause of OA is unknown. Here, using lineage tracing in mice, we show that the BMP-antagonist Gremlin 1 (Grem1) marks a novel chondrogenic progenitor (CP) cell population in the articular surface that generates joint cartilage and subchondral bone during development and adulthood. Notably, this CP population is depleted in injury-induced OA, and with age. OA is also induced by toxin-mediated ablation of Grem1 CP cells in young mice. Transcriptomic analysis and functional modelling in mice revealed articular surface Grem1-lineage cells are dependent on Foxo1; ablation of Foxo1 in Grem1-lineage cells led to early OA. This analysis identified FGFR3 signalling as a therapeutic target, and injection of its activator, FGF18, caused proliferation of Grem1-lineage CP cells, increased cartilage thickness, and reduced OA pathology. We propose that OA arises from the loss of CP cells at the articular surface secondary to an imbalance in progenitor cell homeostasis and present a new progenitor population as a locus for OA therapy.",

    "abstract": "Viral mimicry describes the immune response induced by endogenous stimuli such as dsRNA formed by endogenous retroelements. Activation of viral mimicry has the potential to kill cancer cells or augment anti-tumor immune response. Paradoxically, cancer cells frequently present a dysregulated epigenome, leading to increased expression of retroelements. We previously found that ADAR1 p150 upregulation is an adaptation mechanism to tolerate high retroelement-derived dsRNA levels, leading to a druggable dependency. Here, we systematically identified novel mechanisms of viral mimicry adaptation associated with cancer cell dependencies. We correlated the gene knockout sensitivity from the DepMap dataset and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) dataset of 1005 human cell lines and identified pathways such as RNA modification and nucleic acid metabolism. Among the top hits was the RNA decay protein XRN1 as an essential gene for the survival of a subset of cancer cell lines. XRN1-sensitive cancer cell lines have a high level of cytosolic dsRNA and high ISG expression. Furthermore, sensitivity to XRN1 knockout was mediated by MAVS and PKR activation, indicating that the cells die due to XRN1-dependent induction of viral mimicry. XRN1-resistant cell lines had low basal dsRNA levels, but became synthetically dependent on XRN1 upon treatment with viral mimicry inducing drugs such as 5-AZA-CdR or palbociclib. Finally, XRN1-dependency is partly independent of ADAR1 activity. These results confirm the potential for our ISG correlation analysis to discover novel regulators of viral mimicry and show that XRN1 activation is an adaptive mechanism to control high dsRNA stress induced by dysregulated retroelements in cancer cells and creates a dependency that can be explored for novel cancer therapies.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered numerous trait-associated loci across the human genome, most of which are located in noncoding regions, making interpretations difficult. Moreover, causal variants are hard to statistically fine-map at many loci because of widespread linkage disequilibrium. To address this challenge, we present a strategy utilizing transcription factor (TF) binding quantitative trait loci (bQTLs) for colocalization analysis to identify trait associations likely mediated by TF occupancy variation and to pinpoint likely causal variants using motif scores. We applied this approach to PU.1 bQTLs in lymphoblastoid cell lines and blood cell traits GWAS data. Colocalization analysis revealed 69 blood cell trait GWAS loci putatively driven by PU.1 occupancy variation. We nominate PU.1 motif-altering variants as the likely shared causal variants at 51 loci. Such integration of TF bQTL data with other GWAS data may reveal transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and causal noncoding variants underlying additional complex traits.",

One example is provided by biomolecular condensates, whose microenvironment can be vastly different from the surrounding cellular environments to engage unique biological functions. How microenvironments of biomolecular condensates affect their structure and function remains unknown. Here, we show that the arrangements and partitioning of biomolecules are dictated by the differences between the micropolarity of each subcompartment. Sufficient difference in micropolarity results in layered structures with the exterior shell presenting a more polar microenvironment than the interior core. Accordingly, micropolarity inversion is accompanied by conversions of the layered structures.

    "abstract": "Glutaminase is a rate-limiting enzyme in glutaminolysis, which produces glutamate from glutamine and enters the TCA cycle[1]. In addition, it plays a key role in redox homeostasis[2], autophagy[3], immune system regulation[4], central nervous system maintenance[5], and senolysis[6]. Therefore, the allosteric regulation of glutaminase is a fascinating topic that has broad implications for our understanding of glutamine metabolism and related diseases[7-9]. Phosphate was discovered as a natural agonist for glutaminase in 1947[10], but the structural basis and mechanism for this regulation remains unclear. Using cryo-electron microscopy, here we determine the structure of human glutaminase with phosphate. This structure allows us to capture phosphate binding at the dimer-dimer interface at near atomic resolution, revealing an allosteric activation mechanism by remodelling the catalytic pocket. Surprisingly, we find that phosphate antagonizes BPTES (a classical antagonist) and CB-839 (the current subject of several phase II clinical trials). Accurate identification of phosphate binding sites lays the foundation for the design of glutaminase agonists and antagonists with broad pharmaceutical significance.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular heme formation and trafficking are fundamental processes in living organisms. Three biogenesis pathways are used by bacteria and archaea to produce iron protoporphyrin IX (heme b) that diverge after the formation of the common intermediate uroporphyrinogen III (urogen III). In this work, we identify and provide a detailed characterization of the enzymes involved in the transformation of urogen III into heme. We show that in this organism operates the protoporphyrin-dependent pathway (PPD pathway), in which the last reaction is the incorporation of ferrous iron into the porphyrin ring by the ferrochelatase enzyme. In general, following this final reaction, little is known about how the formed heme b reaches the target proteins. In particular, the chaperons that are thought to be required to traffic heme for incorporation into hemeproteins to avoid the cytotoxicity associated to free heme, remain largely unidentified. We identified in C. jejuni a chaperon-like protein, named CgdH2, that binds heme with a dissociation constant of 4.9 {+/-} 1.0 {micro}M, a binding that is impaired upon mutation of residues histidine 45 and 133. We show that C. jejuni CgdH2 establishes protein-protein interactions with ferrochelatase, which should enable for the observed transfer of heme from ferrochelatase to CgdH2. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that C. jejuni CgdH2 is evolutionarily distinct from the currently known chaperones. Therefore, CgdH2 is a novel chaperone and the first protein identified as an acceptor of the intracellularly formed heme, thus enlarging our understanding of bacterial heme homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Snyder-Robinson Syndrome (SRS) is caused by mutations in the spermine synthase (SMS) gene, the enzyme product of which converts the polyamine spermidine into spermine. Affecting primarily males, common manifestations of SRS include intellectual disability, osteoporosis, hypotonic musculature, and seizures, along with other, more variable symptoms. Currently, medical management focuses on treating symptoms without addressing the underlying molecular cause of the disease.\n\nReduced SMS catalytic activity in cells of SRS patients causes the accumulation of spermidine, while spermine levels are reduced. The resulting exaggeration in spermidine-to-spermine ratio is a biochemical hallmark of SRS that tends to correlate with symptom severity in the patient. Our studies aim to pharmacologically manipulate polyamine metabolism to correct this polyamine imbalance and investigate the potential of this approach as a therapeutic strategy for affected individuals.\n\nHere we report the use of 2-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO; eflornithine), an FDA-approved inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, in re-establishing normal spermidine-to-spermine ratios in SRS patient cells. Through mechanistic studies, we demonstrate that, while reducing spermidine biosynthesis, DFMO also stimulates the conversion of existing spermidine into spermine in cell lines with hypomorphic variants of SMS. Further, DFMO treatment induces a compensatory uptake of exogenous polyamines, including spermine and spermine mimetics, cooperatively reducing spermidine and increasing spermine levels. In a Drosophila SRS model characterized by reduced lifespan, adding DFMO to the feed extends lifespan. As nearly all known SRS patient mutations are hypomorphic, these studies form a foundation for future translational studies with significant therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "The most abundant renewable biopolymer on earth, viz., cellulose, acts as carbon storage reserve in plant and microbial cell walls that could potentially be converted into biofuels or other valuable bioproducts. Cellulose is synthesized by a plant cell membrane-integrated processive glycosyltransferase (GT) called cellulose synthase (CesA). Since only a few of these plant CesAs have been purified and characterized to date, there are huge gaps in our mechanistic understanding of these enzymes. Furthermore, the coordination between different CesAs involved in primary and secondary cell wall formation is yet to be unveiled. The biochemistry and structural biology studies of CesAs are currently hampered by challenges associated with their expression and extraction at high yields. To aid in understanding CesA reaction mechanisms and to provide a more efficient CesA extraction method, two putative plant CesAs - PpCesA5 from Physcomitrella patens and PttCesA8 from Populus tremula x tremuloides that are involved in primary and secondary cell wall formation in plants were expressed using Pichia pastoris as an expression host. We developed a protoplast-based membrane protein extraction approach to directly isolate both these membrane-bound enzymes for purification, as detected by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry-based analyses. Our method results in a higher purified protein yield by 3-4-fold than the standard cell homogenization protocol. Our purified CesAs were reconstituted into liposomes to yield active enzymes that gave similar biochemical characteristics (e.g., substrate utilization and cofactor requirements, no primer needed to initiate polymerization reaction) as enzymes isolated using the standard protocol. This method resulted in reconstituted CesA5 and CesA8 with similar Michaelis-Menten kinetic constants, Km = 167 M, 108 M and Vmax = 7.88x10-5 mol/min, 4.31x10-5 mol/min, respectively, in concurrence with the previous studies. Taken together, these results suggest that CesAs involved in primary and secondary cell wall formation can be expressed and purified using a simple and more efficient extraction method. This could potentially help unravel the mechanism of native and engineered cellulose synthase complexes involved in plant cell wall biosynthesis.",

In this study, we metabolically engineered a cellulolytic thermophile Clostridium thermocellum and demonstrated its compatibility with CBP integrated with a mild Co-solvent Enhanced Lignocellulosic Fractionation (CELF) pretreatment for conversion of hardwood poplar into short-chain esters (i.e., ethyl acetate, ethyl isobutyrate, isobutyl acetate, isobutyl isobutyrate) with broad use as solvents, flavors, fragrances, and biofuels. A recombinant C. thermocellum engineered with deletion of carbohydrate esterases and stable overexpression of a thermostable alcohol acetyltransferase improved the target esters production without compromised deacetylation activities. We discovered these esterases exhibited promiscuous thioesterase activities and their deletion improved ester production by increasing isobutanol flux and rerouting the native electron and carbon fermentative metabolism besides their known major function of ester degradation. The total ester production could be further enhanced up to 80-fold and the composition of short-chain esters could be modified by deleting lactate biosynthesis and/or CELF-pretreated poplar under different pretreatment conditions.",

    "abstract": "Iron acquisition systems are crucial for pathogen growth and survival in iron-limiting host environments. To overcome nutritional immunity, bacterial pathogens evolved to use diverse mechanisms to acquire iron. Here, we examined a heme acquisition system driven by hemophores called HphAs from several Gram-negative bacteria. Structural determination of HphAs revealed a N-terminal clamp-like domain that binds heme and a C-terminal eight-stranded {beta}-barrel domain that shares the same architecture as the Slam-dependent Neisserial surface lipoproteins. The structure of these HphAs is strikingly similar to a novel hemophore discovered by Latham et al. (2019), named hemophilin1. The genetic organization of HphAs consist of genes encoding a Slam homolog and a TonB-dependent receptor (TBDR). We investigated the Slam-HphA system in the native organism or the reconstituted system in E. coli cells and found that the efficient secretion of HphA is dependent on Slam. The TBDR also played an important role for heme uptake and conferred specificity for its cognate HphA. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis of HphA homologs revealed that HphAs are conserved in the alpha, beta, and gammaproteobacteria Together, these results show that HphA presents a new class of hemophores in Gram-negative bacteria and further expands the role of Slams in transporting soluble proteins supporting it role as a type 11 secretion system.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn the environment, microbial communities are constantly exposed to invasion by antimicrobial resistant bacteria (ARB) and their associated antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) that were enriched in the anthroposphere. A successful invader has to overcome the biotic resilience of the habitat, which is more difficult with increasing biodiversity. The capacity to exploit resources in a given habitat is enhanced when communities exhibit greater diversity, reducing opportunities for invaders, leading to a lower persistence. In the context of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) dissemination, exogenous ARB reaching a natural community may persist longer if the biodiversity of the autochthonous community is low, increasing the chance of ARGs to transfer to community members. Reciprocally, high microbial diversity could serve as a natural long-term barrier towards invasion by ARB and ARGs.\n\nResultsTo test this hypothesis, a sampling campaign across seven European countries was carried out to obtain 172 environmental samples from sites with low anthropogenic impact. Samples were collected from contrasting environments: stationary structured forest soils, or dynamic river biofilms and sediments. Microbial diversity and relative abundance of 27 ARGs and 5 mobile genetic element marker genes were determined. In soils, higher diversity, evenness and richness were all significantly negatively correlated with the relative abundance of the majority (>85%) of ARGs. Furthermore, the number of detected ARGs per sample was inversely correlated with diversity. However, no such effects were found for the more dynamic, regularly mixed rivers. Conclusions: In conclusion, we demonstrate that diversity can serve as barrier towards AMR dissemination in the environment. This effect is mainly observed in stationary, structured environments, where long-term, diversity-based resilience against invasion can evolve. Such barrier effects can in the future be exploited to limit the environmental proliferation of AMR.",

    "abstract": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) are the main enzymes of protein biosynthesis. Human glycyl-tRNA synthetase, in addition to the main function of amino acid transfer to the corresponding tRNA molecules, is also involved in the initiation of IRES I translation. All members of the enterovirus genus have this type of IRES.\n\nIt is also known that the presence of point mutations in aaRS leads to the occurrence of diseases in which peripheral nerves are affected. One such disorder of the nervous system is the incurable neurodegenerative disorder Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT). The most studied enzyme whose mutations cause CMT is glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS).\n\nIn this work, we tested the ability of various mutant forms of glycyl-tRNA synthetase associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome to form a stable complex with IRES I. It turned out that neither catalytic activity nor the ability to form a dimer are necessary for the interaction of GlyRS with IRES.",

    "abstract": "Selective transport through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) depends on the dynamic binding of the intrinsically disordered components of the NPC, the FG-nups, with each other and with nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). Hydrophobic interactions with the phenylalanines of FG-nups are critical for this dynamic binding. 1,6-hexanediol (1,6HD), is an aliphatic alcohol that interferes with hydrophobic interactions. Here we assessed the specificity and mechanism by which 1,6HD disrupts the permeability barrier of NPCs in live bakers yeast cells. Exposure to 1,6HD (10 min, 0-5%) leads to gradual loss of the NPC permeability. This is likely a direct effect on the nuclear transport machinery as cell viability, the pH and ATP levels in the cytosol, as well as the appearance of mitochondria, Golgi, peroxisomes, ER, vacuoles, plasma membrane, nucleolus, secretory pathway and stress granules are not notably changed. There are however effects on the cytoskeleton and Hsp104 to be noted. While 1,6HD treatment does not lead to dissociation or degradation of NPC subunits, a massive relocation of multiple NTRs from NPCs does occur. This displacement quantitatively correlates with the increased passive permeability of NPCs. The loss of NTRs and associated cargo will present a major change in the macromolecular crowding and composition and hence the physicochemical properties of the central channel. We conclude that 1,6HD provides a surprisingly specific intervention to temporarily permeate NPCs and we present evidence that the mechanism includes release of NTRs from the NPCs.",

    "abstract": "Stimulation of adipocyte {beta}-adrenergic receptors ({beta}-ARs) induces expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), promoting non-shivering thermogenesis. Association of {beta}-ARs with a lysine myristoylated form of A-kinase anchoring protein 12 (AKAP12)/gravin- is required for downstream signaling that culminates in UCP1 induction. Conversely, demyristoylation of gravin- by histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11) suppresses this pathway. Whether inhibition of HDAC11 in adipocytes is sufficient to drive UCP1 expression independently of {beta}-ARs is not known. Here, we demonstrate that adipocyte-specific deletion of HDAC11 in mice leads to robust induction of UCP1 in adipose tissue (AT), resulting in increased body temperature. These effects are mimicked by treating mice in vivo or human AT ex vivo with an HDAC11-selective inhibitor, FT895. FT895 triggers biphasic, gravin- myristoylation-dependent induction of UCP1 protein expression, with a non-canonical acute response that is post-transcriptional and independent of protein kinase A (PKA), and a delayed response requiring PKA activity and new Ucp1 mRNA synthesis. Remarkably, HDAC11 inhibition promotes UCP1 expression even in models of adipocyte catecholamine resistance where {beta}-AR signaling is blocked. These findings define cell autonomous, multi-modal roles for HDAC11 as a suppressor of thermogenesis, and highlight the potential of inhibiting HDAC11 to therapeutically alter AT phenotype independently of {beta}-AR stimulation.",

Many pathogens lose their pathogenicity by knocking out opgG, an OPG-related gene indispensable for OPG synthesis. However, the biochemical functions of OpgG and OpgD, a paralog of OpgG, have not been elucidated. In this report, structural and functional analyses of OpgG and OpgD from Escherichia coli revealed that these proteins are {beta}-1,2-glucanases with remarkably different activity, establishing a new glycoside hydrolase family. Furthermore, a reaction mechanism with an unprecedentedly long proton transfer pathway is proposed for OpgD. The conformation of the region that forms the reaction pathway differs noticeably between OpgG and OpgD, which explains the observed low activity of OpgG. The findings enhance our understanding of OPG biosynthesis and provide insights into functional diversity for this novel enzyme family.",

Master transcription factors play a key role during development, differentiation, homeostasis and disease pathology. RUNX2 is the master transcription factor for bone development, and it regulates several important signaling pathways during chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. However, modulation of RUNX2 activity during hMSC differentiation into various lineages is not yet fully described. We differentiated hMSCs into chondro-, osteo-, and adipogenic lineages and studied RUNX2 protein dynamics using Transcription Factor - Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (TF-FRAP) at different time points. The TF-FRAP method can capture the dynamic changes of RUNX2 protein mobility at the single cell level resolution, and cluster analysis shows how RUNX2 dynamics change at subpopulation level in proliferating and differentiating hMSCs. Our data show that although whole hMSC population is exposed to differentiation stimuli, some subpopulations in hMSCs do not respond to environmental cues.",

In order to interrogate the pace of acquisition of algal polysaccharide utilizing loci (PUL) and their diffusion rate inside populations, we investigated the PUL dedicated to degradation of porphyran, the main polysaccharide of the red algae Porphyra sp. used to prepare maki-sushi. We demonstrated that both methylated and unmethylated fractions were catabolized without the help of external enzymes. The PUL organization was conserved in several Bacteroidetes strains, highlighting lateral transfers inside the microbiota, but we point out various conserved mutations, deletion and insertions. Geographic distribution of the variants showed that specific mutation and recombination events appeared independently in geographically distant populations.",

We show that axonal serotonin release in the mPFC directly inhibits the major mPFC output neurons. In serotonergic neurons projecting from the dorsal raphe to the mPFC, we find endogenous activity signatures pre-reward retrieval and at reward retrieval during a cognitive flexibility task. In vivo optogenetic activation of this pathway during pre-reward retrieval selectively improved extradimensional rule shift performance while inhibition impaired it, demonstrating sufficiency and necessity for mPFC serotonin release in cognitive flexibility. Locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior were not affected by either optogenetic manipulation. Collectively, our data reveal a powerful and specific modulatory role of endogenous serotonin release from dorsal raphe-to-mPFC projecting neurons in cognitive flexibility.",

Voxel-based studies typically involve the normalization of these qualitatively different HG types, thus making it difficult to evaluate the contribution of sulcal/gyral variability to voxel-based effects and perhaps obscuring some effects. To examine the structural covariance of single and duplicated HG, templates were created for the left single and duplicated HG. Structural covariance analysis with a Jacobian measure of volumetric displacement demonstrated consistent spatial covariance with homologous structure in the right hemisphere across qualitatively different HG morphology.

Computational theories suggest that priority maps identify salient locations based on individual feature dimensions (e.g., color, motion), which are integrated into an aggregate priority map. While widely accepted, a core assumption of this framework--the existence of independent feature dimension maps in visual cortex--remains untested. Here, we tested the hypothesis that feature-selective retinotopic regions in human cortex act as neural feature dimension maps, indexing salience based on their preferred feature. We used fMRI activation patterns to reconstruct spatial maps while participants viewed stimuli with salient regions defined by color or motion direction. Reconstructed spatial maps selectively represented salient locations defined by each regions preferred feature. These findings identify spatially organized feature dimension maps that characterize the salience of scene locations based on a specific visual feature, confirming a key prediction of priority map theory.",

Here we built sensory-cognitive neural network models of working memory that perform tasks using raw visual stimuli. Contrary to intuitions that working memory capacity limitation stems from memory or cognitive constraints, we found that pre-training the sensory region of our models with natural images imposes sufficient constraints on models to exhibit a wide range of human-like behaviors in visual working memory tasks designed to probe capacity. Examining the neural mechanisms in our model reveals that capacity limitation mainly arises in a bottom-up manner. Our models offer a principled and functionally grounded explanation for the working memory capacity limitation without parameter fitting to behavioral data or much hyperparameter tuning. This work highlights the importance of developing models with realistic sensory processing even when investigating memory and other high-level cognitive phenomena.",

    "abstract": "A persistent effort in neuroscience has been to pinpoint the neurobiological substrates that support mental processes. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) aims to develop a new framework based on fundamental neurobiological dimensions. However, results from several meta-analysis of task-based fMRI showed substantial spatial overlap between several mental processes including emotion and anticipatory processes, irrespectively of the valence. Consequently, there is a crucial need to better characterize the core neurobiological processes using a data-driven techniques, given that these analytic approaches can capture the core neurobiological processes across neuroimaging literature that may not be identifiable through expert-driven categories. Therefore, we sought to examine the main data-driven co-activation networks across the past 20 years of published meta-analyses on task-based fMRI studies. We manually extracted 19,822 coordinates from 1,347 identified meta-analytic experiments. A Correlation-Matrix-Based Hierarchical Clustering was conducted on spatial similarity between these meta-analytic experiments, to identify the main co-activation networks. Activation likelihood estimation was then used to identify spatially convergent brain regions across experiments in each network. Across 1,347 meta-analyses, we found 13 co-activation networks which were further characterized by various psychological terms and distinct association with receptor density maps and intrinsic functional connectivity networks. At a fMRI activation resolution, neurobiological processes seem more similar than different across various mental functions. We discussed the potential limitation of linking brain activation to psychological labels and investigated potential avenues to tackle this long-lasting research question.",

Phase entrainment in the beta band, angular velocity in the beta band, power responses in the beta band and delta-beta PAC were assessed for each child and each group.

Children with dyslexia did not exhibit any phase consistency, and beta-band angular velocity was significantly faster compared to control children.

Here, we present a new and upgraded resource, AutophagyNet. It builds on the previous database but contains major improvements to address user feedback and novel needs due to the advancement in omics data availability. AutophagyNet contains updated interaction curation and integration of over 280,000 experimentally verified interactions between core autophagy proteins and their protein, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators as well as their potential upstream pathway connections. AutophagyNet provides annotations for each core protein about their role: 1) in different types of autophagy (mitophagy, xenophagy, etc.); 2) in distinct stages of autophagy (initiation, elongation, termination, etc); 3) with subcellular and tissue-specific localization. These annotations can be used to filter the dataset, providing customizable download options tailored to the users needs. The resource is available in various file formats (e.g., CSV, BioPAX and PSI-MI), and data can be analyzed and visualized directly in Cytoscape. The multi-layered regulation of autophagy can be analyzed by combining AutophagyNet with tissue- or cell type-specific using (multi-)omics datasets (e.g. transcriptomic or proteomic data).
