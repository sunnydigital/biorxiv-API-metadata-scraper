    "abstract": "Deciphering the mechanism of secondary cell wall/SCW formation in plants is key to understanding their development and the molecular basis of biomass recalcitrance. Although transcriptional regulation is essential for SCW formation, little is known about the implication of post-transcriptional mechanisms in this process. Here we report that two bonafide RNA-binding proteins homologous to the animal translational regulator Musashi, MSIL2 and MSIL4, function redundantly to control SCW formation in Arabidopsis. MSIL2/4 interactomes are similar and enriched in proteins involved in mRNA binding and translational regulation. MSIL2/4 mutations alter SCW formation in the fibers, leading to a reduction in lignin deposition, and an increase of 4-O-glucuronoxylan methylation. In accordance, quantitative proteomics of stems reveal an overaccumulation of glucuronoxylan biosynthetic machinery, including GXM3, in the msil2/4 mutant stem. We showed that MSIL4 immunoprecipitates GXM mRNAs, suggesting a novel aspect of SCW regulation, linking post-transcriptional control to the regulation of SCW biosynthesis genes.",

    "abstract": "The final step in secretion is membrane fusion facilitated by SNARE proteins that reside in opposite membranes. The formation of a trans-SNARE complex between one R and three Q coiled-coiled SNARE domains drives the final approach of the membranes providing the mechanical energy for fusion. Biological control of this mechanism is exerted by additional domains within some SNAREs. For example, the N-terminal Longin domain (LD) of R-SNAREs (also called Vesicle-associated membrane proteins, VAMPs) can fold back onto the SNARE domain blocking interaction with other cognate SNAREs. The LD may also determine the subcellular localization via interaction with other trafficking related proteins. Here, we provide cell-biological and genetic evidence that phosphorylation of the Tyrosine57 residue regulates the functionality of VAMP721. We found that an aspartate mutation mimics phosphorylation, leading to protein instability and subsequent degradation in lytic vacuoles. The mutant SNARE also fails to rescue the defects of vamp721vamp722 loss-of-function lines in spite of its wildtype-like localization within the secretory pathway and the ability to interact with cognate SNARE partners. Most importantly, it imposes a dominant negative phenotype interfering with root growth, normal secretion and cytokinesis in wildtype plants generating large aggregates that mainly contain secretory vesicles. Non-phosphorylatable VAMP721Y57F needs higher gene dosage to rescue double mutants in comparison to native VAMP721 underpinning that phosphorylation modulates SNARE function. We propose a model where a short-lived phosphorylation of Y57 serves as a regulatory step to control VAMP721 activity, favouring its open state and interaction with cognate partners to ultimately drive membrane fusion.",

    "abstract": "Local adaptation frequently evolves in patches or environments that are connected via migration. In these cases, genomic regions that are linked to an adaptive locus experience reduced effective migration rates. Via individual-based simulations of a two-patch system, we show that this reduced effective migration results in the accumulation of conditionally deleterious mutations, but not universally deleterious mutations, adjacent to adaptive loci. When there is redundancy in the genetic basis of local adaptation (i.e. genotypic redundancy), turnover of adaptive loci allows conditionally deleterious mutation load to be purged. The amount of mutational load that accumulates adjacent to adaptive loci is dependent on redundancy, recombination rate, migration rate, population size, strength of selection, and the phenotypic effect size of adaptive alleles. Our results highlight the need to be cautious when interpreting patterns of local adaptation at the level of phenotype or fitness, as the genetic basis of local adaptation can be transient, and evolution may confer a degree of maladaptation to non-local environments.",

    "abstract": "For popcorn, obtaining and identifying haploids are still challenging steps. We aimed to induce and screen haploids in popcorn using the Navajo phenotype, seedling vigor and ploidy level. We used the Krasnodar Haploid Inducer (KHI) in crosses with 20 popcorn source germplasms and five maize controls. The field trial design was completely randomized, with three replications. We assessed the efficacy of induction and of identification of haploids based on haploidy induction rate (HIR) and false positive and negative rates (FPR and FNR). Additionally, we also measured the penetrance of the Navajo marker gene (R1-nj). All putative haploids classified by R1-nj were germinated together with a diploid sample and evaluated for false positives and negatives based on vigor. Seedlings from 14 females were submitted to flow cytometry to determine the ploidy level. The HIR and penetrance were analyzed by fitting a generalized linear model with a logit link function. The HIR of the KHI, adjusted by cytometry, ranged from 0.0 to 1.2%, with a mean of 0.34%. The average FPR from screening based on the Navajo phenotype were 26.2% and 76.4%, by the vigor and ploidy, respectively. The FNR was zero. The penetrance of R1-nj ranged from 30.8 to 98.6%. The average number of seeds per ear in temperate germplasm (76) was lower than that obtained in tropical germplasm (98). There is induction of haploids in germplasm of tropical and temperate origin. We recommend the selection of haploids associating the Navajo phenotype with a direct method of confirming the ploidy level, such as flow cytometry. We also show that haploid screening based on Navajo phenotype and seedling vigor reduces misclassification. The origin and genetic background of the source germplasm influence the R1-nj penetrance. Because the known inducers are maize, developing doubled-haploid technology for popcorn hybrid breeding requires overcoming the unilateral cross-incompatibility.",

    "abstract": "Because measuring expansion volume (EV) is simple and inexpensive, popcorn breeders have developed high-quality single crosses ignoring the contents of zeins, starch, lipids, and cellular wall components in selection. However, some methods of quantification of these quality-related traits can be applied to popcorn breeding, increasing the selection efficacy for quality. The objectives of this study were assess methods of quantification of zeins and starch that can be used in popcorn breeding, characterize a temperate and a tropical populations for zeins and starch contents, and identify candidate genes for these quality-related traits. We genotyped and phenotyped 286 plants. For quantification of total zeins and zein subunits we choose the  lab-on-a-chip microfluidic electrophoresis. For quantification of starch and amylose/amylopectin we choose the Megazymes Amylose/Amylopectin kit assay. The temperate population has superior EV (+36%), a higher level (+32%) of the 19 kDa zein subunit, and lower levels of the 21, 22, and 27 kDa subunits (-1543, -40 and -47%, respectively). Although there are statistical differences between the two populations regarding starch, amylose, and amylose/amylopectin ratio, the differences are not significant (-2 to 8%). Six candidate genes were identified for the 19 and 22 kDa zeins, one for the 21 kDa zein, one for total zeins, two for starch, and four for amylose, with emphasis on three genes from the Z1C subfamily, coding for the 19 and 22 kDa alpha-zeins, located on chromosome 4. The evaluated quantification methods can be used in popcorn breeding programs, with the potential to revolutionize the breeding for quality.\n\nKey messageThe protein chip and the Amylose/Amylopectin kit assay for zein and starch quantification, respectively, can be effectively used in popcorn breeding, with the potential to revolutionize the breeding for quality.",

HPTG enables parallelized in vivo screening of 43 three-dimensional microtissues within a single 3D printed device. Using HPTG, we screen microtissue formations with varying cellular and material components and identify formulations that support vascular self-assembly, integration and tissue function. Our studies highlight the importance of combinatorial studies that vary cellular and material formulation variables concomitantly, by revealing that inclusion of stromal cells can \"rescue\" vascular self-assembly in manner that is material-dependent. HPTG provides a route for accelerating pre-clinical progress for diverse medical applications including tissue therapy, cancer biomedicine, and regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "To survive extreme desiccation, seeds enter dormancy that can last millennia. This dormancy involves the accumulation of protective but structurally disordered storage proteins through unknown adjustments of proteolytic surveillance mechanisms. Mutation of all six types II metacaspases (MCAs)-II in the model plant Arabidopsis revealed their essential role in modulating these proteolytic mechanisms. MCA-II mutant seeds fail to properly target at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) the AAA ATPase Cell Division Cycle 48 (CDC48) to dispose of misfolded proteins. MCA-IIs cleave a CDC48 adaptor, the ubiquitination regulatory X domain-containing (PUX) responsible for localizing CDC48 to the lipid droplets. When cleaved, CDC48-PUX is inactivated and allows a lipid droplet-to-ER shuttling of CDC48, an important step in the regulation of seeds lifespan. In sum, we uncover antagonism between proteolytic pathways bestowing longevity.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryMetacaspase proteases confer seed longevity by antagonizing CDC48 activity.",

    "abstract": "While many heterologous molecules can be produced via microbial bioconversion processes, maximizing their titers, rates, and yields from lignin-derived carbon streams remains challenging. Growth coupling can not only increase titers and yields but also shift the production period from stationary phase to growth phase. These methods for designing growth-coupling strains however require multi-gene edits for implementation which may be perceived as impractical. Here, we computationally evaluated 4,114 potential solutions for growth coupling para-coumarate to indigoidine production and prototype two cut sets in Pseudomonas putida KT2440. We used adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) on the initial triple deletion strain to restore growth on p-CA. Using X-ray tomography on this post-ALE strain we revealed increased cell density and decreased cell volume. Proteomics identified upregulated peroxidases that mitigate reactive oxygen species formation. Nine iterative stepwise modifications further informed by model-guided and rational approaches realized a growth coupled strain that produced 7.3 g/L indigoidine at 77% MTY in para-coumarate minimal medium. These ensemble strategies provide a blueprint for producing target molecules at high product titers, rates, and yields.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=80 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/532821v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f0754aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a45d24org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@df0596org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e7e140_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Action reading is thought to engage motor simulations, yielding modulations in activity of motor-related cortical regions, and contributing to action language comprehension. To test these ideas, we measured 1) corticospinal excitability during action reading, and 2) reading comprehension ability, in individuals with normal and impaired imagery (i.e., phantasia and aphantasia, respectively). Thirty-four participants (17 phantasic and 17 aphantasic) were asked to read manual action sentences. By means of transcranial magnetic stimulation, we triggered motor-evoked potentials (MEP) in the target right index finger. MEP amplitude, a marker of corticospinal excitability, increased during action reading relative to rest for phantasic individuals, but not for aphantasic individuals. This result provides neurophysiological evidence that individuals living with aphantasia present a real neurophysiological deficit in motor system engagement during action reading. Furthermore, deep-level reading comprehension ability was impaired in individuals with aphantasia, who had difficulty selecting words that best fit the context of sentences. Altogether, these findings support the idea that motor simulations, along with the activation within the motor system, contribute to action language comprehension.",

    "abstract": "Cellular interactions are essential for tissue organization and functionality. In particular, immune cells rely on direct and usually transient interactions with other immune and non-immune populations to specify and regulate their function. To study these \"kiss-and-run\" interactions directly in vivo, we previously developed LIPSTIC (Labeling Immune Partnerships by SorTagging Intercellular Contacts), an approach that uses enzymatic transfer of a labeled substrate between the molecular partners CD40L and CD40 to label interacting cells. Reliance on this pathway limited the use of LIPSTIC to measuring interactions between CD4+ helper T cells and antigen presenting cells, however. Here, we report the development of a universal version of LIPSTIC (uLIPSTIC), which can record physical interactions both among immune cells and between immune and non-immune populations irrespective of the receptors and ligands involved. We show that uLIPSTIC can be used, among other things, to monitor the priming of CD8+ T cells by dendritic cells, reveal the cellular partners of regulatory T cells in steady state, and identify germinal center (GC)-resident T follicular helper (Tfh) cells based on their ability to interact cognately with GC B cells. By coupling uLIPSTIC with single-cell transcriptomics, we build a catalog of the immune populations that physically interact with intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and find evidence of stepwise acquisition of the ability to interact with IECs as CD4+ T cells adapt to residence in the intestinal tissue. Thus, uLIPSTIC provides a broadly useful technology for measuring and understanding cell-cell interactions across multiple biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Conflicts between humans and polar bears have been predicted to increase as polar bear prime habitat, sea ice, is decreasing. In Svalbard, a strong protection and strict control schemes have secured near complete records of bears killed and found dead since 1987. We analyzed the trend in the number of kills and related this to human visitation to the island. We found a slight decrease in the number of kills in the period 1987-2019, and a decrease in per capita number of kills when monthly kills were compared to the monthly number of visitors disembarking in the main settlement. We then used a discrete choice resource selection model to assess whether polar bear kill events are related to attributes of the kill sites and environmental conditions at the time. We divided Svalbard in four sectors, North, East, South, and West, and monthly average ice cover was calculated in 25-km rings around Svalbard, rings that were further delineated by the four sectors. We found that the odds of a kill was greater along the shoreline, and that the odds would be reduced by 50% when moving only 900 m from the shoreline when all sectors were included. Distance from other covariates like settlements, trappers cabins, and landing sites for tourists did for the most part not have a significant impact on the odds of a kill. Sectorwise, ice cover had no significant impact on the odds for a kill. The decreasing trend in kills of polar bears might partly be explained by the success of strict protection and management regimes of Svalbard wilderness.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how species assemble into communities is a central tenet in ecology. One of the most elusive questions is the relative contribution of environmental filtering versus limiting similarity. Important advances in this area have been achieved by looking at communities through a functional lens (i.e., the traits they express), so as to derive principles valid across species pools. Yet, even using traits in lieu of taxonomy, the issue remains controversial because i) environmental filtering and limiting similarity often act simultaneously in shaping communities; and ii) their effect is scale-dependent. We exploited the experimental arena offered by caves, island-like natural laboratories characterized by largely constant environmental gradients and a limited diversity of species and interactions. Leveraging uniquely available data on distribution and traits for European cave spiders, we tested explicit hypotheses about variations in community assembly rules across ecological gradients and scales. We demonstrate that environmental filtering and limiting similarity shape cave communities acting on trait evolution in opposing directions. These effects are strongly scale dependent, varying along multiple environmental gradients. Conversely, the effect of geography on trait composition is weak, indicating that trait turnover in space happens primarily by substitution of species pursuing similar functions due to strong environmental filters. Our findings reconcile contrasted views about the relative importance of the two main mechanisms shaping patterns of biodiversity, and provide a conceptual foundation to account for scaling effects in the study of community assembly.",

Here, we conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature, screening 563 abstracts and identifying 204 studies that used SDMs to produce distribution estimates for mosquito species. While the number of studies employing SDM methods has increased markedly over the past decade, the overwhelming majority used a single method (MaxEnt) and focused on human infectious disease vectors or their close relatives. The majority of regional models were developed for areas in Africa and Asia, while more localized modeling efforts were most common for North America and Europe. Findings from this study highlight gaps in taxonomic, geographic, and methodological foci of current SDM literature for mosquitoes that can guide future efforts to study the geography of mosquito-borne disease risk.",

    "abstract": "After centuries of deforestation, many industrialised countries are experiencing an increase in forest area and biomass due to changes in land- and forest-use since the mid-20th century. At the same time, the impacts of climate change on forests are aggravating, but the interplay between past land- and forest-use (i.e. land- and forest-use legacies) and climate change in forest functioning remains elusive. Here using network theory and linear mixed models, we quantified how land- and forest-use legacies modulate tree growth synchrony in response to climate change. We analysed tree growth data from European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) stands with different histories of forest management at the species rear edge. We found that tree growth synchrony increased following heatwaves, late spring frosts, and reduced precipitation. Interestingly, the greatest tree growth synchrony occurred in recently-established forests, while stands containing large trees and heterogeneous tree sizes showed much lower growth synchrony. Our results highlight the importance of maintaining large trees and structurally heterogeneous forests to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on forest productivity, and thereby, increase forest resilience to future forest climate risks.",

How the placenta and the fetus respond to acute MIA over time is unknown. Here, we characterized the response to acute maternal pulmonary inflammation across time in maternal and fetal organs using multi-omics. Unlike maternal organs which mounted strong innate immune responses, the placenta upregulated tissue-integrity genes, likely to prevent fetal exposure to infections, and downregulated growth-associated genes. Subsequently, the placenta upregulated biosynthesis and endoplasmic reticulum stress genes in order to return to homeostasis. These responses likely protected the fetus, since we observed no immune response in fetal liver. Instead, likely due to nutrient depletion, the fetal liver displayed metabolic adaptations, including increases in lipids containing docosahexaenoic acid, crucial for fetal brain development. Our study shows, for the first time, the integrated temporal response to pulmonary MIA across maternal and fetal organs.",

    "abstract": "Yams are important tubers widely consumed in developing countries in various forms, mainly boiled, pounded and fried. Tuber quality is a key criterion for acceptance by the various actors in the value chain. However, the genetics of yam tuber quality has not yet been comprehensively investigated. Given this lack of knowledge, we used population genomics and candidate gene association approaches to unravel the genetic basis of the three main quality attributes of boiled yam, namely texture, starch content and colour indices. We re-sequenced the whole genome of 127 yam genotypes with different quality attributes, and performed an enrichment of the already available functional genome annotation using comparative genomics. Population genomics analysis highlighted three main genetic groups and 1,053 genes under selection. We focused this work on three known quality trait-related pathways: pectin, starch content and flavonoid biosynthesis, and inventoried in the genome all the structural genes related to those pathways by comparative genomics. We improved the functional annotation of the three pathways with 48% more genes. A total of 18 candidate genes containing genetic variants significantly associated with the target traits were detected, including eight genes that were also found under selection. The texture-related candidate genes were distributed between the pectin and starch pathways. Overall, the use of comparative genomics has allowed the generation of an unprecedented genomic resource. The improved functional annotation of the yam genome is a promising predictive tool for identifying other core genes associated with any trait of interest to meet the growing need and diversified demands for yams.",

Yet, the genomic basis of these evolutionary changes remains unclear. Utilizing the high-quality genome assemblies of great apes (including human), gibbon and macaque, we conducted comparative genome analyses, and identified 15,885 great-ape-specific structural variants (GSSVs), including 8 coding GSSVs resulting in the creation of novel proteins (e.g. ACAN and CMYA5). Functional annotations of the GSSV-related genes revealed the enrichment of genes involved development and morphogenesis, especially neurogenesis and neural network formation, suggesting the potential role of GSSVs in shaping the great-ape-shared traits. Further dissection of the brain-related GSSVs show great-ape-specific changes of enhancer activities and gene expression in the brain, involving a group of GSSV-regulated genes (such as NOL3) that potentially contribute to the altered brain development and function in great apes. The presented data highlights the evolutionary role of structural variants in the phenotypic innovations during the origin of the great lineage.",

By expressing the highly specific PUFe RNA-binding domain fused to CD63 in EV producer cells stably expressing the target mRNA, our system exceeds mRNA loading efficiencies by up to 4.5-fold over previously reported EV-based approaches. By combining with an mRNA-stabilizing protein, PABPc, and a fusogenic endosomal escape moiety, VSVg, functional mRNA delivery in vivo is achieved at doses substantially lower than clinically used lipid nanoparticles.

Our studies demonstrate that the binding modes of MKIs are like that of their corresponding acyclic counterparts against the same kinase targets. Importantly, within the respective binding sites, the MKI scaffolds retain the same conformations as their corresponding acyclic counterparts, demonstrating the rigidity of scaffolds before and after molecular cyclization. The MKI database includes 641 nanomole-level MKIs from 56 human kinases elucidating the features of rigid scaffolds, and the tendency of core structures among MKIs.

Existing statistical tests are insufficient however, as none are simultaneously computationally efficient and statistically valid for a finite number of observations. In this work, motivated by a recent application in reference-genome-free inference (1), we develop OASIS (Optimized Adaptive Statistic for Inferring Structure), a family of statistical tests for contingency tables. OASIS constructs a test-statistic which is linear in the normalized data matrix, providing closed form p-value bounds through classical concentration inequalities. In the process, OASIS provides a decomposition of the table, lending interpretability to its rejection of the null. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the OASIS test statistic, showing that these finite-sample bounds correctly characterize the p-value bound derived up to a variance term. Experiments on genomic sequencing data highlight the power and interpretability of OASIS. The same method based on OASIS significance calls detects SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium Tuberculosis strains de novo, which cannot be achieved with current approaches. We demonstrate in simulations that OASIS is robust to overdispersion, a common feature in genomic data like single cell RNA-sequencing, where under accepted noise models OASIS still provides good control of the false discovery rate, while Pearsons X2 test consistently rejects the null. Additionally, we show on synthetic data that OASIS is more powerful than Pearsons X2 test in certain regimes, including for some important two group alternatives, which we corroborate with approximate power calculations.",

    "abstract": "The uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) dissipates the transmembrane (TM) proton gradient in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) by leaking protons across the membrane, producing heat in the process. Such non-shivering production of heat in brown adipose tissue can combat obesity-related diseases. UCP1 associated proton leak is activated by free fatty acids and inhibited by purine nucleotides. The mechanism of proton leak remains unknown, in part due to the unavailability of high-resolution structures of the protein. As a result, the binding site of the activators (fatty acids) and inhibitors (nucleotides) is unknown. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we generate a conformational ensemble of UCP1. Using Metadynamics-based free energy calculations, we converge on the most likely ATP-bound conformation of UCP1. Our conformational ensemble provides a molecular basis of a breadth of prior biochemical data available for UCP1. Based on the simulations, we make the following testable predictions about the mechanisms of activation of proton leak and proton leak inhibition by ATP: (1) R277 plays the dual role of stabilising ATP at the binding site for inhibition, and acting as a proton surrogate for D28 in the absence of a proton during proton transport (2) the binding of ATP to UCP1 is mediated by residues R84, R92, R183, and S88 (3) R92 shuttles ATP from the E191-R92 gate in the inter-membrane space to the nucleotide binding site, and serves to increase ATP affinity (4) ATP can inhibit proton leak by controlling the ionisation states of matrix facing lysine residues such as K269 and K56 and (5) fatty acids can bind to UCP1 from the IMM either via the cavity between TM1 and TM2 or between TM5 and TM6. Our simulations set the platform for future investigations into the proton transport and inhibition mechanisms of UCP1.",

    "abstract": "Rotating excitation waves and electrical turbulence in excitable cardiac tissue are associated with arrhythmias such as life-threatening ventricular fibrillation. Experimental studies (S. Luther et al., Nature 475, 235-239 (2011)). have shown that a time-periodic sequence of low-energy electrical far-field pulses is able to terminate fibrillation more gently than a single high-energy pulse. During this so called low-energy antifibrillation pacing (LEAP), only tissue near sufficiently large conduction heterogeneities, such as large coronary arteries, is activated. Based on extensive simulations and simple theoretical reasoning, we present a comprehensive unified mechanism for successful LEAP in two spatial dimensional systems, which is able to explain both the termination of stable spirals and of spatiotemporal chaos. We carried out extensive simulations (more than 500000 runs for each considered model) varying pacing periods, pacing field strength and initial conditions using a model of cardiac tissue perforated by blood vessels, which was found earlier to reproduce the behavior seen in the LEAP experiments for different dynamical regimes and different cellular models (P. Buran et al., Chaos 27, 113110 (2017) and New J. Phys. 24 083024 (2022)). We studied altogether three different cellular models to capture qualitatively different kinds of fibrillatory states like stable spirals and spatiotemporal chaos. To achieve a mechanistic understanding of the simulation results, we have investigated a variety of macroscopic observables characterizing an excitable medium with respect to their correlation with the success of an individual low-energy pulse during LEAP. We found in all considered cases that the refractory boundary length LRB, the total length of the borders between refractory and excitable parts of the tissue, displays the strongest correlation with the success of the pacing and thus predicts best the success of an individual LEAP pulse. Furthermore, we found the success probability PL decays exponentially with this length according to PL = exp(- k(E)LRB), where E is the strength of the electrical field in pacing and k(E) is a monotonically decreasing function of E. A closer look at the spatiotemporal dynamics in the simulations reveals that actually each pulse during LEAP annihilates practically all defects and excitation fronts, however, also induces new pairs of defects and associated excitation fronts at the refractory boundaries. The success probability of each individual pulse can thus be simply interpreted as the probability that no new rotor pair gets created by the shock, while all existing defects get annihilated. This assumption allows to derive the observed exponential dependence of the success probability on the refractory boundary length, where the prefactor k(E) in the exponent is equal (for stable spirals) or proportional (for spatiotemporal chaos) to the probability{lambda} (E) that a new rotor pairs is created by the shock along a segment of unit length along the refractory boundary. Our findings are in conformity with the upper limit of vulnerability (ULV) hypothesis, which states that the single pulse defibrillation threshold is simply given by the lowest field strength, where no new rotor pairs arise as a result of the shock. LEAP operates at field strengths (and energies) below this ULV limit. Successful LEAP protocols are characterized by a coordinated interplay between the pulses, that gradually decreases the refractory boundary length and therefore simultaneously increases the success probability until complete defibrillation is achieved.",

    "abstract": "The canonical ion channels gated by chemical ligands use the free energy of agonist binding to open the channel pore, returning to a closed state upon agonist departure. A unique class of ion channels, known as channel-enzymes (chanzymes), possess additional enzymatic activity that is directly or indirectly linked to their channel function. Here we investigated a TRPM2 chanzyme from choanoflagellates, an evolutionary ancestor of all metazoan TRPM channels, which integrates two seemingly incompatible functions into a single peptide: a channel module activated by ADP ribose (ADPR) with high open probability and an enzyme module (NUDT9-H domain) consuming ADPR at a remarkably slow rate. Using time-resolved cryo- electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we captured a complete series of structural snapshots of the gating and catalytic cycles, revealing the coupling mechanism between channel gating and enzymatic activity. Our results showed that the slow kinetics of the NUDT9-H enzyme module confers a novel self-regulatory mechanism, whereby the enzyme module modulates channel gating in a binary manner. Binding of ADPR to NUDT9-H first triggers tetramerization of the enzyme modules, promoting channel opening, while the subsequent hydrolysis reaction reduces local ADPR availability, inducing channel closure. This coupling enables the ion-conducting pore to alternate rapidly between open and closed states, avoiding Mg2+ and Ca2+ overload. We further demonstrated how the NUDT9-H domain has evolved from a structurally semi-independent ADPR hydrolase module in early species TRPM2 to a fully integrated component of a gating ring essential for channel activation in advanced species TRPM2. Our study demonstrated an example of how organisms can adapt to their environments at the molecular level.",

    "abstract": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the most characterized pathway for cells to internalize diverse receptor-bound cargo such as proteins, nanoparticles, and viruses. However, the effect of membrane tension on clathrin-coated pit (CCP) maturation remains inadequately characterized. This study aimed to figure out the effect of membrane tension on CCP maturation spatially and temporarily, which is still a controversial and elusive issue. We obtained the sizes and spatial distributions of CCPs by the structured illumination microscopy of fixed cells and observed CCP lifetimes in live cells by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. The processes of CCP maturation and abortion were reproduced numerically through Monte Carlo simulation. The results showed that the growth time of CCP was more reasonably proportional to its volume rather than its surface area. We further investigated the spatial distribution of the membrane tension and size of CCPs and found a significant positive correlation between the membrane tension and the size of mature CCPs spatially, indicating that the CCPs tended to enrich in the highest-tension region, especially the mature ones. This finding agreed with our numerical prediction that the CCP structure grew larger to overcome a higher energy barrier caused by higher background cell membrane tension. Based on the aforementioned results, we speculated that when the external environment was complex, the cells might choose to reinforce the endocytic vesicles by CCPs in high-tension regions to ensure adequate nutrient uptake.",

    "abstract": "Most membrane proteins are oligomers, but the physical forces explaining the stable association of these complexes inside the lipid bilayer are not well understood. The homodimeric antiporter CLC-ec1 highlights the puzzling nature of this reaction. This complex is thermodynamically stable even though it associates via a large hydrophobic protein-protein interface that appears well adapted to interact with the membrane interior. In a previous study, however, we discovered that when CLC-ec1 is dissociated, this interface introduces a morphological defect in the surrounding membrane, leading us to hypothesize association is driven by the elimination of this defect upon dimerization. This study tests this hypothetical mechanism directly and shows it is supported by molecular and physical models. First, using coarse-grained umbrella-sampling molecular simulations, we calculated the membrane contribution to the potential-of-mean-force for dimerization in a POPC bilayer. This shows the stable association of CLC subunits prior to formation of direct protein-protein contacts, but only via the native interface that presents the membrane defect, and not others. Single-molecule photobleaching experiments show that addition of short-chain DLPC lipids, known to alleviate the membrane defect, also shifts the association equilibrium from dimers to monomers. We explain this destabilizing effect through additional umbrella-sampling and alchemical free-energy simulations, which show DLPC enrichment of the defect diminishes the membrane contribution to the association free energy, as it improves the lipid-solvation energetics of the monomer but not the dimer. In summary, this study establishes a physical model that explains the stability and orientational specificity of CLC dimers in terms of membrane-mediated forces, rather than protein-protein interactions. We posit that cells might ubiquitously leverage morphological defects in the bilayer to drive organization of membrane proteins into functional complexes, and that cellular regulation of lipid composition can modulate this organizing effect.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic flows are widely emerging as key functional players in development. In early Drosophila embryos, flows drive the spreading of nuclei across the embryo. Here, we combine hydrodynamic modeling with quantitative imaging to develop a two-fluid model that features an active actomyosin gel and a passive viscous cytosol. Gel contractility is controlled by the cell cycle oscillator, the two fluids being coupled by friction. In addition to recapitulating experimental flow patterns, our model explains observations that remained elusive, and makes a series of new predictions. First, the model captures the vorticity of cytosolic flows, which highlights deviations from Stokes flow that were observed experimentally but remained unexplained. Second, the model reveals strong differences in the gel and cytosol motion. In particular, a micron-sized boundary layer is predicted close to the cortex, where the gel slides tangentially whilst the cytosolic flow cannot slip. Third, the model unveils a mechanism that stabilizes the spreading of nuclei with respect to perturbations of their initial positions. This self-correcting mechanism is argued to be functionally important for proper nuclear spreading. Fourth, we use our model to analyze the effects of flows on the transport of the morphogen Bicoid, and the establishment of its gradients. Finally, the model predicts that the flow strength should be reduced if the shape of the domain is more round, which is experimentally confirmed in Drosophila mutants. Thus, our two-fluid model explains flows and nuclear positioning in early Drosophila, while making predictions that suggest novel future experiments.",

Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of human CSF reveal a substantial inflammatory infiltrate in LM.

To investigate the mechanistic relationships between immune cell signaling and cancer cells within the leptomeninges, we developed syngeneic lung, breast, and melanoma LM mouse models. Here we show that transgenic host mice, lacking IFN-{gamma} or its receptor, fail to control LM growth. Overexpression of Ifng through a targeted AAV system controls cancer cell growth independent of adaptive immunity. Instead, leptomeningeal IFN-{gamma} actively recruits and activates peripheral myeloid cells, generating a diverse spectrum of dendritic cell subsets. These migratory, CCR7+ dendritic cells orchestrate the influx, proliferation, and cytotoxic action of natural killer cells to control cancer cell growth in the leptomeninges. This work uncovers leptomeningeal-specific IFN-{gamma} signaling and suggests a novel immune-therapeutic approach against tumors within this space.",

    "abstract": "Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is a progressive form of blindness caused by degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, mainly caused by mutations in the OPA1 mitochondrial dynamin like GTPase (OPA1) gene. OPA1 encodes a dynamin-like GTPase present in the mitochondrial inner membrane. When associated with OPA1 mutations, DOA can present not only ocular symptoms but also multi-organ symptoms (DOA plus). DOA plus often results from point mutations in the GTPase domain, which are assumed to have dominant negative effects. However, the presence of mutations in the GTPase domain does not always result in DOA plus. Therefore, an experimental system to distinguish between DOA and DOA plus is needed. In this study, we found that loss-of-function mutations of the dOPA1 gene in Drosophila can imitate the pathology of optic nerve degeneration observed in DOA. We successfully rescued this degeneration by expressing the human OPA1 (hOPA1) gene, indicating that hOPA1 is functionally interchangeable with dOPA1 in the fly system. However, we could not rescue any previously reported mutations known to cause either DOA or DOA plus. By expressing both WT and DOA plus mutant hOPA1 forms in the optic nerve of dOPA1 mutants, we observed that DOA plus mutations suppressed the rescue, facilitating the distinction between loss-of-function and dominant negative mutations in hOPA1. The fly model developed in this study can assist in the differential diagnosis between DOA and DOA plus and inform early treatment decisions in patients with mutations in hOPA1.",

Tolcapone is an effective antiparkinsonian drug. However, its safety studies on mothers and fetuses are limited. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of tolcapone on the mother and the developing fetus during different stages if gestation. Tolcapone was administered to pregnant mice at a dose of 60 (H-Tol) or 30 mg/kg/day (L-Tol) during early or mid-gestation. We observed that tolcapone administration during early gestation causes abortion and delays fetal development in a dose-dependent manner. During mid-gestation tolcapone barely caused embryo lethality; however, the mice developed preeclampsia-like phenotypes, including maternal hypertension, proteinuria, and fetal growth restriction. Histomorphological analysis of placentas from tolcapone treated mice revealed abnormalities in the trophoblast layer and the impaired trophoblast invasion in the decidua. Mechanistically, we revealed that tolcapone inhibits the invasion and migration of trophoblasts in vitro, with changes in the protein expression of Snail, Twist, and E-cadherin. In conclusion, tolcapone caused embryo lethality and growth restriction during early gestation, whereas it caused preeclampsia-like phenotypes in mice with defective trophoblast invasion in mid-gestation. Collectively, our study provides novel insights into the effects of tolcapone on pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "VASP is a member of the Enabled/VASP protein family that is involved in cortical actin dynamics and may also contribute to the formation of gap junctions. In vessels, gap junctional coupling allows the transfer of signals along the vessel wall and coordinates vascular behavior. Moreover, VASP is reportedly a mediator of NO-induced inhibition of platelet aggregation. Therefore, we hypothesized that VASP exerts also important physiologic functions in arterioles. We examined the spread of vasodilations enabled by gap junctional coupling in endothelial cells as well as NO-induced arteriolar dilations in VASP-deficient mice by intravital microscopy of the microcirculation in a skeletal muscle in anesthetized mice. Conducted dilations were initiated by brief, locally confined stimulation of the arterioles with acetylcholine. The maximal diameters of the arterioles under study ranged from 30 to 40 m. Brief stimulation with acetylcholine induced a short dilation at the local site that was also observed at remote, upstream sites without an attenuation of the amplitude up to a distance of 1.2 mm in control animals (wild-type). In contrast, remote dilations were reduced in VASP-deficient mice despite a similar local dilation indicating an impairment of conducted dilations. Superfusion of NOdonors induced a concentration-dependent dilation in wild-type mice. However, these dilations were slightly reduced in VASP-deficient animals. In contrast, dilations induced by the endothelial stimulator acetylcholine were fully preserved in VASP-deficient mice. In summary, this study suggests that VASP exerts critical functions in arteriolar diameter control. It is crucial for the conduction of dilator signals along the endothelial cell layer. The impairment possibly reflects a perturbed formation of gap junctions in the endothelial cell membrane. VASP also participates in the full dilatory potential of NOdonors although the effect of its deficiency is only subtle. In contrast, VASP is not required for dilations initiated by endothelial stimulation which are mediated in the murine microcirculation by an EDH-mechanism.",

Freezing and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedding (FFPE) are two common ways to store tissues, and these practices have generated vast biospecimen repositories. However, these biospecimens have been underutilized for multi-omic analysis due to the low throughput of current analytical technologies that impede large-scale studies.\n\nMethodsTissue sampling, preparation, and downstream analysis were integrated into a 96-well format multi-omics workflow, MultiomicsTracks96. Frozen mouse organs were sampled using the CryoGrid system, and matched FFPE samples were processed using a microtome. The 96-well format sonicator, PIXUL, was adapted to extract DNA, RNA, chromatin, and protein from tissues. The 96-well format analytical platform, Matrix, was used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP), methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP), and RNA reverse transcription (RT) assays followed by qPCR and sequencing. LC-MS/MS was used for protein analysis. The Segway genome segmentation algorithm was used to identify functional genomic regions, and linear regressors based on the multi-omics data were trained to predict protein expression.\n\nResultsMultiomicsTracks96 was used to generate 8-dimensional datasets including RNA-seq measurements of mRNA expression; MeRIP-seq measurements of m6A and m5C; ChIP-seq measurements of H3K27Ac, H3K4m3, and Pol II; MeDIP-seq measurements of 5mC; and LC-MS/MS measurements of proteins. We observed high correlation between data from matched frozen and FFPE organs. The Segway genome segmentation algorithm applied to epigenomic profiles (ChIP-seq: H3K27Ac, H3K4m3, Pol II; MeDIP-seq: 5mC) was able to recapitulate and predict organ-specific super-enhancers in both FFPE and frozen samples. Linear regression analysis showed that proteomic expression profiles can be more accurately predicted by the full suite of multi-omics data, compared to using epigenomic, transcriptomic, or epitranscriptomic measurements individually.\n\nConclusionsThe MultiomicsTracks96 workflow is well suited for high dimensional multi-omics studies - for instance, multiorgan animal models of disease, drug toxicities, environmental exposure, and aging as well as large-scale clinical investigations involving the use of biospecimens from existing tissue repositories.",

A transient downregulation of GLUT1, the central glucose transporter in T-cells, marked the onset of reprogramming in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. At late activation, CD4+ T-cells upregulated enzymes associated with degradation of fatty acids while CD8+ T-cells preferentially upregulated enzymes in the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins. Surprisingly, we found that activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells became transcriptionally more divergent at the same time their proteome became more similar.

    "abstract": "A new species of cichlid fish, Lethrinops chilingali is described from specimens collected from Lake Chilingali, near Nkhotakota, Malawi. It is assigned to the genus Lethrinops based on the form of the lower jaw dental arcade and by the absence of traits diagnostic of the phenotypically similar Ctenopharynx, Taeniolethrinops and Tramitichromis. It also lacks the enlarged cephalic lateral line canal pores found in species of Alticorpus and Aulonocara. The presence of a broken horizontal stripe on the flanks of females and immature/non-territorial males of Lethrinops chilingali distinguishes them from all congeners, including Lethrinops lethrinus, in which the stripe is typically continuous. Lethrinops chilingali also has a relatively shorter snout, shorter lachrymal bone and less ventrally positioned mouth than Lethrinops lethrinus. It appears likely that Lethrinops chilingali is now extinct in the wild, as this narrow endemic species has not been positively recorded in the natural environment since 2009. Breeding populations remain in captivity.",

    "abstract": "Predicting effects of climate change on plant disease is critical for protecting ecosystems and food production. Climate change could exacerbate plant disease because parasites may be quicker to acclimate and adapt to novel climatic conditions than their hosts due to their smaller body sizes and faster generation times. Here we show how disease pressure responds to the anomalous weather that will increasingly occur with climate change by compiling a global database (5380 plant populations; 437 unique plant-disease combinations; 2,858,795 individual plant-disease samples) of disease incidence in both agricultural and wild plant systems. Because wild plant populations are assumed to be adapted to local climates, we hypothesized that large deviations from historical conditions would increase disease incidence. By contrast, since agricultural plants have been transported globally, we did not expect the historical climate where they are currently grown to be as predictive of disease incidence. Supporting these hypotheses, we found that disease outbreaks tended to occur during periods of warm temperatures in agricultural and cool-climate wild plant systems, but also occurred in warm-adapted wild (but not agricultural) plant systems experiencing anomalously cool weather. Outbreaks were additionally associated with higher rainfall in wild systems, especially those with historically wet climates. Our results suggest that historical climate affects susceptibility to disease for wild plant-disease systems, while warming drives risks for agricultural plant disease outbreaks regardless of historical climate.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) is a powerful method for studying folding states and mechanical properties of proteins, however, it requires surface immobilization of proteins onto force-transducing probes such as cantilevers or microscale beads. A common immobilization method relies on coupling surface-exposed lysine residues to carboxylated surfaces using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl) carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS). Because proteins typically contain many lysine groups, this strategy results in a heterogeneous distribution of tether positions in the molecule. Genetically encoded peptide tags (e.g., ybbR) provide alternative chemistries for achieving site-specific immobilization, but thus far a direct comparison of site-specific vs. lysine-based immobilization strategies to assess effects on the observed mechanical properties was lacking. Here, we directly compared lysine- vs. ybbR-based protein immobilization in SMFS assays using several model polyprotein systems. Our results show that lysine-based immobilization results in significant signal deterioration for monomeric streptavidin-biotin interactions, and loss of the ability to correctly classify unfolding pathways in a multipathway Cohesin-Dockerin system. We developed a mixed immobilization approach where a site-specifically tethered ligand was used to probe surface-bound proteins immobilized through lysine groups, and found partial recovery of specific signals. The mixed immobilization approach represents a viable alternative for mechanical assays on in vivo-derived samples or other proteins of interest where genetically encoded tags are not feasible.",

In multicolor configurations it can even be the ideal tool to investigate interactions, but this is hindered by a number of experimental challenges. We systematically and quantitatively analyze the impact of all the necessary sub-elements of any SPT-TIRF setup on signal-to-noise ratio, especially in dynamic studies using minimally-invasive dyes for biomolecule labeling. We show that the dominant limiting factor is the autofluorescence originating from the commonly-used optical glass. We identify and test a different material and show a significant improvement of signal-to-noise ratio in a multichannel TIRF configuration employing the new glass covers. We also address the problem of photobleaching of fluorescent probes by presenting effective approaches suited to a multicolor implementation that requires simultaneous stabilization of multiple dyes. We apply the developed protocol to the analysis of p75 receptors labeled by two fluorophores on the membrane of living cells. Our strategy yields reliable, simultaneous two-color SPT, even for fast-diffusing receptors, enabling this study under conditions not accessible with standard experimental configurations. We argue that the present protocol can pave the way for multicolor super-resolved localization and tracking of single molecules by TIRF microscopy, much expanding the potential of SPT.",

Here, we quantify interactive effects of genotype and environment on immune traits by investigating three inbred mouse strains rewilded in an outdoor enclosure and infected with the parasite, Trichuris muris. Whereas cytokine response heterogeneity was primarily driven by genotype, cellular composition heterogeneity was shaped by interactions between genotype and environment. Notably, genetic differences under laboratory conditions can be decreased following rewilding, and variation in T cell markers are more driven by genetics, whereas B cell markers are driven more by environment. Importantly, variation in worm burden is associated with measures of immune variation, as well as genetics and environment. These results indicate that nonheritable influences interact with genetic factors to shape immune variation, with synergistic impacts on the deployment and evolution of defense mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "RNase E is a major ribonuclease for RNA metabolism in bacteria. Because it has a large substrate spectrum and poor substrate specificity, its activity must be well controlled under different conditions. Only a few regulators of RNase E are known in bacteria, limiting our understanding on the posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms operating in these organisms. Here we show that, RebA, a protein universally present in cyanobacteria, interacts with RNase E in the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC 7120. Distinct from those known regulators of RNase E, RebA interacts with the 5 sensor domain in the catalytic region of RNase E, and suppresses the cleavage activities of RNase E for all tested RNA substrates irrespective of their 5-end status. Consistent with the inhibitory function of RebA on RNase E, conditional depletion of RNase E and overproduction of RebA caused formation of elongated cells, whereas the absence of RebA and overproduction of RNase E resulted in a shorter-cell phenotype. We further showed that the morphological changes caused by altered levels of RNase E or RebA are dependent on their physical interaction. The action of RebA represents a new mechanism, highly conserved in cyanobacteria, for RNase E regulation. Our findings provide insights into the regulation and the function of RNase E, and demonstrate the importance of balanced RNA metabolism in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to determine minimum selection concentrations of various antibiotics using four manure-originated multi-drug resistant plasmids in a surrogate Escherichia coli host. These plasmids carried genes conferring resistance phenotypes to several antibiotic classes including {beta}-lactams, lincosamides, phenicols, macrolides, sulfonamides and tetracyclines. The minimum selection concentrations of antibiotics tested in nutrient-rich medium were determined: 14.1-28.2 mg/L for penicillin G, 0.1 mg/L for oxytetracycline, 0.45 mg/L for chlortetracycline, 2 mg/L for lincomycin, 1 mg/L for florfenicol, 1.3-4 mg/L for azithromycin, 0.13-0.25 mg/L for tetracycline, 0.004-0.01 mg/L for cefotaxime. Penicillin G, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, lincomycin and florfenicol had minimum selection concentrations in nutrient-defined medium slightly changed within 3.5-fold range compared to those in nutrient-rich medium. The minimum selection concentrations of antibiotics interfering folic acid synthesis in bacteria were also determined: 63 mg/L for sulfamethoxazole, 11.2 mg/L for sulfisoxazole and 0.06 mg/L for trimethoprim. Mixing two antibiotics changed minimum selection concentrations within 3.7-fold range compared to those in single antibiotic tests. Relatively high plasmid loss rates (> 90%) were observed when culturing plasmid-bearing strains in antibiotic-free nutrient-rich and nutrient-defined media. Overall results suggested that these plasmids can be maintained at concentrations environmentally relevant in waste water treatment plants, sewage, manure and manured soil although they are not stable in antibiotic-free environments.\n\nIMPORTANCEAntibiotic resistance crisis is a grave concern in healthcare systems around the world. To combat this crisis, we sought to find out how likely manure-originated multi-drug resistant plasmids are to be selected and maintained in different environment matrices. Our study showed that these plasmids conferring resistance to {beta}-lactams, lincosamides, phenicols, macrolides, sulfonamides and tetracyclines can be selected at minimum selection concentrations which are lower than minimum inhibition concentrations of the E. coli host strain. Lincomycin, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim had minimum selection concentrations lower than the antibiotic concentrations in several environment matrices reported previously. Our findings suggest that despite the burden and the high rate of plasmid loss, these plasmids can still be selected, maintained and circulated well in some polluted environments.",

    "abstract": "This study was to assess the gene diversity and characterize a large set of plasmids harboring extended {beta}-lactamase (ESBL) genes from raw and digested dairy manure. A total of eighty-four plasmids that were captured in this E. coli recipient were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology. Twenty-four plasmids of interest were subsequently sequenced using MinION technology in order that a hybrid assembly could be performed on short-and long-read sequences to circularize and complete these plasmids. The size of sequenced plasmids ranged between 40 and 260 kb with various incompatibility groups: IncC, IncI1, IncN, IncY, IncB/O/K/Z, IncX1, IncHI2, IncHI2A, IncFIB(K), IncFII. A variety of extended {beta}-lactamase genes were identified: blaCTXM -1, blaCTXM -14, blaCTXM -15, blaCTXM-27, blaCTXM-55, blaCTXM-61, blaPER-1, blaIMP-27. Interestingly, the blaIMP-27 gene, a novel metallo-{beta}-lactamase discovered in the last decade, was found located on an integrated region in the host chromosome. And one plasmid carrying the blaCMY-2 gene, an AmpC gene, also expressed ESBL phenotype. Four virulence factors, including cia, cib, traT and terC, were detected on some of these plasmids. In addition, six type-2 toxin-antitoxin systems were detected: MazF/E, PemK/I, HipA/B, YdcE/D, RelB/E and HigB/A. Twenty-two out of twenty-four complete plasmids carried putative prophage regions; and most of prophage hits were marked as incomplete, except that the largest plasmid pT525A and the IncY plasmid pT415A had prophage hits with higher scores.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe widespread of antibiotic resistant bacteria is largely due to the exchange of mobile genetic elements such as plasmids. Plasmids harboring extended {beta}-lactamase (ESBL) genes originated from dairy manure potentially become entrained in manured soil, which subsequently enter the human food chain. Currently there is a lack of detailed information on these plasmids in the environment, specifically in dairy manure. This study unveils the abundance and diversity of ESBL-carrying plasmids from both raw and digested manures which were captured in gfp-labelled E. coli CV601. In addition, the study provides insightful information of plasmid characteristics including incompatibility groups, ESBL genes combined with other resistance genes, mobile genetic elements (transposons, insertion sequence), toxin-antitoxin systems, virulence factors and prophage sequences.",

A. tumefaciens strain 1D1609 genome encodes four effector genes, in which all four are specialized effector harboring a conserved N-terminal PAAR-like DUF4150 domain but distinct C-terminal effector domains. Previous study reported that V2a is a His-Me finger nuclease toxin contributing to DNase-mediated antibacterial activity. However, it remains unknown about the functions and roles of other three effectors. In this study, we identified V2c is another His-Me finger nuclease encoded by 1D1609 genome but with distinct SHH motif differed from AHH motif of V2a. We demonstrated that the ectopic expression of V2c caused growth inhibition, plasmid DNA degradation, and cell elongation in Escherichia coli. The cognate immunity protein, V3c, neutralizes the DNase activity and rescues phenotypes of the growth inhibition and cell elongation. Ectopic expression of V2c DNase-inactive variants retain the cell elongation phenotype while V2a induced cell elongation in a DNase-mediated manner. We also showed that the amino acids of conserved SHH and HNH motifs are responsible for the V2c DNase activity in vivo and in vitro. Notably, V2c also mediated the DNA degradation and cell elongation of target cell in the context of interbacterial competition. Importantly, V2a and V2c function synergistically to exert stronger antibacterial activity against the soft rot phytopathogen, Dickeya dadantii.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is now in a post-pandemic period, for which the potential for re-emergence and future spread is unknown. Adding to this uncertainty is the unique capacity of ZIKV to directly transmit between humans via sexual transmission. Recently, we demonstrated that direct transmission of ZIKV between vertebrate hosts leads to rapid adaptation resulting in enhanced virulence in mice and the emergence of three amino acid substitutions (NS2A-A117V, NS2A- A117T, and NS4A-E19G) shared among all vertebrate-passaged lineages. Here, we further characterized these host-adapted viruses and found that vertebrate-passaged viruses also have enhanced transmission potential in mosquitoes. To understand the contribution of genetic changes to the enhanced virulence and transmission phenotype, we engineered these amino acid substitutions, singly and in combination, into a ZIKV infectious clone. We found that NS4A- E19G contributed to the enhanced virulence and mortality phenotype in mice. Further analyses revealed that NS4A-E19G results in increased neurotropism and distinct innate immune signaling patterns in the brain. None of the substitutions contributed to changes in transmission potential in mosquitoes. Together, these findings suggest that direct transmission chains could enable the emergence of more virulent ZIKV strains without compromising mosquito transmission capacity, although the underlying genetics of these adaptations are complex.",

Bacteria maintain a diversity of PBPs, indicating that despite their apparent functional redundancy, there is differentiation across the PBP family. Seemingly redundant proteins can be important for enabling an organism to cope with environmental stressors. We sought to evaluate the consequence of environmental pH on PBP enzymatic activity in Bacillus subtilis. Our data show that a subset of B. subtilis PBPs change activity levels during alkaline shock and that one PBP isoform is rapidly modified to generate a smaller protein (i.e., PBP1a to PBP1b). Our results indicate that a subset of the PBPs are preferred for growth under alkaline conditions, while others are readily dispensable. Indeed, we found that this phenomenon could also be observed in Streptococcus pneumoniae, implying that it may be generalizable across additional bacterial species and further emphasizing the evolutionary benefit of maintaining many, seemingly redundant periplasmic enzymes.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=119 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/533529v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bf28c7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e2e88org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1112259org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e604ae_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The M. tb genome lacks obvious homologues of several conserved cell division proteins, and this study aimed at identifying and functionally characterising mycobacterial homologues of the E.coli septum site specification protein MinD (Ec MinD). Sequence homology based analyses suggested that the genomes of both M.tb and the saprophyte Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis) encode two putative Ec MinD homologues - Rv1708/MSMEG_3743 and Rv3660c/MSMEG_6171. Both Rv1708 and MSMEG_3743 were observed to fully complement the mini-cell phenotype of the E.coli {Delta}minDE mutant HL1, but the other homologues only partially complemented the mutant phenotype. Over-expression of MSMEG_3743 but not MSMEG_6171 in M. smegmatis led to cell elongation and a drastic decrease in CFU counts, indicating the essentiality of MSMEG_3743 in cell-division. Sequence analysis of MSMEG_3743 showed a conserved Walker A motif, the functional role of which was confirmed by a radiolabelled ATPase activity assay. Rv1708 was observed to interact with the chromosome associated proteins ScpA and ParB, pointing to a link between its septum formation role and chromosome segregation. Comparative structural analyses showed Rv1708 to be closer in similarity to Ec MinD than Rv3660c. In summary we have demonstrated that Rv1708 and MSMEG_3743 are true mycobacterial homologues of Ec MinD, adding a critical missing piece to the mycobacterial cell division puzzle.",

    "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila grows intracellularly within a host membrane-bound vacuole that is formed in response to a bacterial type IV secretion system (T4SS). T4SS translocated Sde proteins promote phosphoribosyl-linked ubiquitination of endoplasmic reticulum protein Rtn4, but the role played by this modification is obscure due to lack of clear growth defects of mutants. To identify the steps in vacuole biogenesis promoted by these proteins, mutations were identified that unmasked growth defects in {Delta}sde strains. Mutations in the sdhA, ridL and legA3 genes aggravated the {Delta}sde fitness defect, resulting in disruption of the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) membrane within 2 hrs of bacterial contact with host cells. Depletion of Rab5B and sorting nexin 1 partially bypassed loss of Sde proteins, consistent with Sde blocking early endosome and retrograde trafficking, similar to roles previously demonstrated for SdhA and RidL proteins. Sde protein protection of LCV lysis was only observed shortly after infection, presumably because Sde proteins are inactivated by the metaeffector SidJ during the course of infection. Deletion of SidJ extended the time that Sde proteins could prevent vacuole disruption, indicating that Sde proteins are negatively regulated at the posttranslational level and are limited to protecting membrane integrity at the earliest stages of replication. Transcriptional analysis was consistent with this timing model for an early point of execution of Sde protein. Therefore, Sde proteins act as temporally-regulated vacuole guards during establishment of the replication niche, possibly by constructing a physical barrier that blocks access of disruptive host compartments early during biogenesis of the LCV.\n\nSignificance statementMaintaining replication compartment integrity is critical for growth of intravacuolar pathogens within host cells. By identifying genetically redundant pathways, Legionella pneumophila Sde proteins that promote phosphoribosyl-linked ubiquitination of target eukaryotic proteins are shown to be temporally-regulated vacuole guards, preventing replication vacuole dissolution during early stages of infection. As targeting of reticulon 4 by these proteins leads to tubular endoplasmic reticulum aggregation, Sde proteins are likely to construct a barrier that blocks access of disruptive early endosomal compartments to the replication vacuole. Our study provides a new framework for how vacuole guards function to support biogenesis of the L. pneumophila replicative niche.",

    "abstract": "Abstract (Summary)Plasmodium falciparum has an AT-rich genome with highly biased codon and amino acid usage that is not balanced by the tRNA genes repertoire. To determine whether individual tRNA genes can be differentially expressed to compensate for the tRNA-codon imbalance, we characterized the tRNA profiles of the parasite. While we found that the parasite stably maintained a biased expression of different tRNAs throughout the intraerythrocytic cycle (IDC), the tRNA-codon imbalance remains. Specifically, the requirements for a limited tRNA subset in the codons of a gene negatively correlated with its mRNA level. A detailed analysis revealed that these observations implicate host adaptation during P. falciparum genome evolution, whereby housekeeping genes evolved to minimize dependence on exogenous amino acids, allowing these genes to mitigate the negative effects during acute nutrient deprivation. We found that these host-adapted features can derive a decentralized nutrient-dependent regulatory programme via sensing isoleucine as a proxy for nutrient stress, which causes a reduction in aminoacylated Ile-tRNA level. This, in turn, rapidly reprogrammes the global protein output and transcriptome in a targeted fashion. Our findings provide strong evidence showing that the primary sequences of proteins underlie gene expression programmes, suggesting new perspectives on protein evolution.",

This study analyzes the secretome of six pathogenic P. syringae pv. aptata strains with different defined virulence capacities in order to identify common and strain-specific features, and correlate the secretome with disease outcome. All strains show a high type III secretion system (T3SS) and type VI secretion system (T6SS) activity under apoplast-like conditions mimicking the infection. Surprisingly, we found that low pathogenic strains show a higher secretion of most T3SS substrates, whereas a distinct subgroup of four effectors was exclusively secreted in medium and high pathogenic strains. Similarly, we detected two T6SS secretion patterns: while one set of proteins was highly secreted in all strains, another subset consisting of known T6SS substrates and previously uncharacterized proteins was exclusively secreted in medium and high virulence strains. Taken together, our data show that P. syringae pathogenicity is correlated with the repertoire and fine-tuning of effector secretion and indicate distinct strategies for establishing virulence of P. syringae pv. aptata in plants.",

    "abstract": "Natural transformation is a process where bacteria actively take up DNA from the environment and recombine it into their genome or reconvert it into extra-chromosomal genetic elements. The evolutionary benefits of transformation are still under debate. One main explanation is that foreign allele and gene uptake facilitates natural selection by increasing genetic variation, analogous to meiotic sex. However, previous experimental evolution studies comparing fitness gains of evolved transforming- and isogenic non-transforming strains have yielded mixed support for the \"sex hypothesis.\" Previous studies testing the sex hypothesis for natural transformation have largely ignored species interactions, which theory predicts provide conditions favourable to sex. To test for the adaptive benefits of bacterial transformation, the naturally transformable wildtype Acinetobacter baylyi and a transformation-deficient {Delta}comA mutant were evolved for five weeks. To provide strong and potentially fluctuating selection, A. baylyi was embedded in a community of five other bacterial species. DNA from a pool of different Acinetobacter strains was provided as a substrate for transformation. No effect of transformation ability on the fitness of evolved populations was found, with fitness increasing non-significantly in most treatments. Populations showed fitness improvement in their respective environments, with no apparent costs of adaptation to competing species. Despite the absence of fitness effects of transformation, wildtype populations evolved variable transformation frequencies that were slightly greater than their ancestor which potentially could be caused by genetic drift.",

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been explored to treat metabolic syndrome by restoring the GM. FMT is generally safe, but motivated by case-reports, accidental transfer of pathogenic bacteria remains a concern. Fecal virome transplantation (FVT, sterile-filtrated feces) from lean donors has shown promise in alleviating metabolic effects of a high-fat diet. FVT has the advantage over FMT that mainly bacteriophages are transferred but still carries the risk of eukaryotic viral infections. To address this, modified FVTs were compared with unmodified FVT and saline in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Unmodified-FVT improved liver pathology and reduced adipose inflammation, while \"eukaryotic-virus-free\" FVT enhanced blood glucose clearance. GM analysis suggested bacteriophage-mediated GM modulation had influenced these outcomes.

Viruses have a high potential to modify the rumen digestion of feeds via infection and cell lysis of prokaryotes in the rumen; however, understanding of the rumen virome is substantially less advanced due to limitations of the reference genome database. In this study, we conducted metagenomic sequencing of virus-like particles (VLPs) in the rumens of 22 Japanese cattle to construct a reference viral genome catalog of the rumen and uncover the rumen virome characteristics. We succeeded in construction of 8 232 nonredundant viral genomes ([&ge;]5 kb length and [&ge;]50% completeness). Among them, putative hosts of 1 223 virus genomes were predicted, and 1 053 virus genomes were taxonomically classified, mainly Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, and Podoviridae. Additionally, 2 764 putative auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) were identified in the viral genomes. Importantly, 22 viral genomes associated with archaea in the rumen were identified. Some archaeal viruses have AMGs related to DNA synthesis, suggesting that archaeal viruses control archaeal populations in the rumen and affect methane production from the rumen. Furthermore, we revealed that most rumen viruses were highly rumen-and individual-specific and related to rumen-specific prokaryotes. Overall, the rumen viral catalog and findings of this study will help future analyses to uncover the roles of rumen viruses in feed digestion, productivity, and methane production.",

    "abstract": "The advent of genome editing platforms such as the CRISPR/Cas9 system ushers an unprecedented speed on the development of new crop varieties that can withstand agricultural challenges of the 21st century. The CRISPR/Cas9 system depends on the specificity of engineered single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). However, sgRNA design in plants can be challenging due to a multitude of design tools to choose from, many of which use guidelines that are based on animal experiments yet allow the use of plant genomes. Upon choosing sgRNAs, it is also unclear whether an in vitro assay is needed to validate the targeting efficiency of a particular sgRNA prior to in vivo delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Here, we demonstrate the in vitro and in vivo activity of four different sgRNAs that we selected based on their ability to target multiple members of the eggplant polyphenol oxidase gene family. Some sgRNAs that have high in vitro cleavage activity did not produce edits in vivo, suggesting that an in vitro assay may not be a reliable basis to predict sgRNAs with highly efficient in vivo cleavage activity. Further analysis of our sgRNAs using other design algorithms suggest that plant-validated criteria such as the presence of necessary secondary structures and appropriate base-pairing may be the reason for the discrepancy between our observed in vitro and in vivo cleavage efficiencies.

    "abstract": "Efficient repair of DNA lesions is essential for faithful transmission of genetic information between somatic cells and for genome integrity across generations. Plants have multiple, partially redundant and overlapping DNA repair pathways, probably due to the less constricted germline and the inevitable exposure to light including higher energy wavelengths. Many proteins involved in DNA repair and their mode of actions are well described. In contrast, a role for DNA damage-associated RNA components, evident from many other organisms, is less well understood. Here, we have challenged young Arabidopsis thaliana plants with two different types of genotoxic stress and performed de novo assembly and transcriptome analysis. We identified three long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are lowly or not expressed under regular conditions but up-regulated or induced by DNA damage. To understand their potential role in DNA repair, we generated CRISPR/Cas deletion mutants and found that the absence of the lncRNAs impairs the recovery capacity of the plants from genotoxic stress. The genetic loci are highly conserved among world-wide distributed Arabidopsis accessions and within related species in the Brassicaceae group. Together, these results suggest that the lncRNAs have a conserved function in connection with DNA damage and provide a basis for a mechanistic analysis of their role.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomal pauses are a critical part of co-translational events including protein folding and localization. However, extended ribosome pauses can lead to ribosome collisions, resulting in the activation of ribosome rescue pathways and turnover of protein and mRNA. While this relationship has been known, the specific threshold between permissible pausing versus activation of rescue pathways has not been quantified. We have taken a method used to measure elongation time and adapted it for use in S. cerevisiae to quantify the impact of elongation stalls. We find, in transcripts containing Arg CGA codon repeat-induced stalls, a Hel2-mediated dose-dependent decrease in protein expression and mRNA level and an elongation delay on the order of minutes. In transcripts that contain synonymous substitutions to non-optimal Leu codons, there is a decrease in protein and mRNA levels, as well as similar elongation delay, but this occurs through a non-Hel2-mediated mechanism. Finally, we find that Dhh1 selectively increases protein expression, mRNA level, and elongation rate. This indicates that distinct poorly translated codons in an mRNA will activate different rescue pathways despite similar elongation stall durations. Taken together, these results provide new quantitative mechanistic insight into the surveillance of translation and the roles of Hel2 and Dhh1 in mediating ribosome pausing events.",

    "abstract": "Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is an NAD+ dependent histone H3 deacetylase that is prominently found associated with chromatin, attenuates transcriptionally active promoters and regulates DNA repair, metabolic homeostasis and lifespan. Unlike other sirtuins, it has low affinity to free histone tail but demonstrates strong binding to nucleosomes. It is poorly understood how SIRT6 docking on nucleosomes stimulates its histone deacetylation activity. Here we present the structure of human SIRT6 bound to a nucleosome determined by cryogenic electron microscopy. The zinc finger domain of SIRT6 associates tightly with the acidic patch of the nucleosome through multiple arginine anchors. The Rossmann fold domain binds to the terminus of the looser DNA half of the nucleosome, detaching two turns of the DNA from the histone octamer and placing the NAD+ binding pocket close to the DNA exit site. This domain shows flexibility with respect to the fixed zinc finger and moves with, but also relative to, the unwrapped DNA terminus. We apply molecular dynamics simulations of the histone tails in the nucleosome to show that in this mode of interaction, the active site of SIRT6 is perfectly poised to catalyze deacetylation of the H3 histone tail and that the partial unwrapping of the DNA allows even lysines close to the H3 core to reach the enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Pangenomes exhibit remarkable variability in many prokaryotic species. This variation is maintained through the processes of horizontal gene transfer and gene loss. Repeated acquisitions of near-identical homologs can easily be observed across pangenomes, leading to the question of whether these parallel events potentiate similar evolutionary trajectories, or whether the remarkably different genetic background of the recipients mean that post-acquisition evolutionary trajectories end up being quite different. In this study, we present a machine learning method that predicts the presence or absence of genes in the Escherichia coli pangenome based on the presence of other accessory genes within the genome. We are, in effect, asking whether gene acquisitions potentiate similar evolutionary trajectories or not. Our analysis leverages the repeated transfer of genes through the E. coli pangenome to observe patterns of repeated evolution following similar events. The presence or absence of a substantial set of genes is highly predictable, from other genes alone, indicating that selection potentiates and maintains gene-gene co-occurrence and avoidance relationships deterministically over long-term bacterial evolution despite differences in host evolutionary history. We propose that the pangenome can be understood as a set of genes with relationships that govern their likely cohabitants, analogous to an ecosystems set of interacting organisms. Our findings highlight intra-genomic gene fitness effects as key drivers of prokaryotic evolution, with ensuing pangenome-wide emergence of repeated patterns of community structure.",

    "abstract": "Most microbes evolve faster than their hosts and should therefore drive evolution of host-microbe interactions1-3. However, relatively little is known about the characteristics that define the adaptive path of microbes to host-association. In this study we have identified microbial traits that mediate adaptation to hosts by experimentally evolving the bacterium Pseudomonas lurida with the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We repeatedly observed the evolution of beneficial host-specialist bacteria with improved persistence in the nematode, achieved by mutations that uniformly upregulate the universal second messenger c-di-GMP. We subsequently upregulated c-di-GMP in different Pseudomonas species, consistently causing increased host-association. Comparison of Pseudomonad genomes from various environments revealed that c-di-GMP underlies adaptation to a variety of hosts, from plants to humans, suggesting that it is fundamental for establishing host-association.",

However, the efforts to expand these toolkits for use in live animals has been limited. Here, we report a new method for the semi-synthesis of site-specifically modified and chemically defined proteins in live animals. Importantly, we illustrate the usefulness of this methodology in the context of a challenging, chromatin bound N-terminal histone tail within rodent postmitotic neurons located in ventral striatum (Nucleus Accumbens/NAc). This approach provides the field with a precise and broadly applicable methodology for manipulating histones in vivo, thereby serving as a unique template towards examining chromatin phenomena that may mediate transcriptomic and physiological plasticity within mammals.",

In this study, we report the 3.0-[A] resolution cryo-EM structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 1,3-{beta}-glucan synthase, Fks1. The structure reveals a central catalytic region adopting a cellulose synthase fold with a cytosolic conserved GT-A type glycosyltransferase domain and a closed transmembrane glucan-transporting channel. We found that two extracellular disulfide bonds are crucial for Fks1 enzymatic activity.

    "abstract": "RNA plays an indispensable role in mammalian cell functions. Cas13, a class of RNA-guided ribonuclease, is a flexible tool for modifying and regulating coding and non-coding RNAs, with enormous potential for creating new cell functions. However, the lack of control over Cas13 activity has limited its cell engineering capability. Here, we present the CRISTAL (Control of RNA with Inducible SpliT CAs13 Orthologs and Exogenous Ligands) platform. CRISTAL is powered by a collection (10 total) of orthogonal split inducible Cas13s that can be turned ON or OFF via small molecules in multiple cell types, providing precise temporal control. Also, we engineered Cas13 logic circuits that can respond to endogenous signaling and exogenous small molecule inputs. Furthermore, the orthogonality, low leakiness, and high dynamic range of our inducible Cas13d and Cas13b enable the design and construction of a robust incoherent feedforward loop, leading to near-perfect and tunable adaptation response. Finally, using our inducible Cas13s, we achieve simultaneous multiplexed control of multiple genes in vitro and in mice. Together, our CRISTAL design represents a powerful platform for precisely regulating RNA dynamics to advance cell engineering and elucidate RNA biology.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveSynovial fluid contains proteins that may have been released from surrounding tissues, our aim was to gain new insights into the proteomic profiles of human synovial fluid in knees with and without osteoarthritis (OA).\n\nMethodsWe used synovial fluid from 11 patients with end-stage medial compartment knee OA, aspirated during total knee replacement, and from 13 deceased donors who had no prior history of knee OA (healthy controls). These samples were analyzed using high-multiplex immunoassays Olink(R). The differential expression of proteins between the groups was analyzed using a linear mixed effects model. The linear associations between pairs of protein expressions were estimated with a linear regression model.\n\nResultsWe found that almost half of the detected proteins were differentially expressed between the OA and non-OA controls. The proteins that were most elevated in the OA group compared to controls were tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5 (fold change 10.6, 95% CI [6.6-17.0]), coagulation factor XI (4.3 [2.6-6.8]) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (4.3 [2.3-6.8]). The proteins with lower levels in OA compared to controls were fatty acid-binding protein, adipocyte (0.03 [0.02-0.05]), myocilin (0.05 [0.03-0.08]) and carbonic anhydrase 3 (0.14 [0.09-0.23]). The protein-protein co-expression analysis suggests an overall lower number of protein pairs that show co-expression in OA.\n\nConclusionThere is a substantial change in protein abundance in synovial fluid in end-stage knee OA, suggesting that global joint homeostasis is severely deranged. Our findings suggest altered co-expression between the immune response and extracellular matrix organization in end-stage knee OA, in comparison to non-OA controls.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models are seeing increased use as methods to predict mutational effects or allowed mutations in proteins. The models commonly used for these purposes include large language models (LLMs) and 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These two model types have very different architectures and are commonly trained on different representations of proteins. LLMs make use of the transformer architecture and are trained purely on protein sequences whereas 3D CNNs are trained on voxelized representations of local protein structure. While comparable overall prediction accuracies have been reported for both types of models, it is not known to what extent these models make comparable specific predictions and/or generalize protein biochemistry in similar ways. Here, we perform a systematic comparison of two LLMs and two structure-based models (CNNs) and show that the different model types have distinct strengths and weaknesses. The overall prediction accuracies are largely uncorrelated between the sequence- and structure-based models. Overall, the two structure-based models are better at predicting buried aliphatic and hydrophobic residues whereas the two LLMs are better at predicting solvent-exposed polar and charged amino acids. Finally, we find that a combined model that takes the individual model predictions as input can leverage these individual model strengths and results in significantly improved overall prediction accuracy.",

    "abstract": "During meiosis, genetic recombination is initiated by the formation of many DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) catalysed by the evolutionarily conserved topoisomerase-like enzyme, Spo11, in preferred genomic sites known as hotspots. DSB formation activates the Tel1/ATM DNA damage responsive (DDR) kinase, locally inhibiting Spo11 activity in adjacent hotspots via a process known as DSB interference. Intriguingly, in S. cerevisiae, over short genomic distances (<15 kb), Spo11 activity displays characteristics of concerted activity or clustering, wherein the frequency of DSB formation in adjacent hotspots is greater than expected by chance. We have proposed that clustering is caused by a limited number of sub-chromosomal domains becoming primed for DSB formation. Here, we demonstrate that DSB clustering is abolished when meiotic prophase timing is extended via deletion of the NDT80 transcription factor. We propose that extension of meiotic prophase enables most cells, and therefore most chromosomal domains within them, to reach an equilibrium state of similar Spo11-DSB potential, reducing the impact that priming has on estimates of coincident DSB formation. Consistent with this view, genome-wide maps of Spo11-DSB formation generated in the absence of Tel1 are skewed towards regions that load pro-DSB factors early--revealing regions of preferential priming--but this effect is abolished when NDT80 is deleted. Our work highlights how the stochastic nature of Spo11-DSB formation in individual cells within the limited temporal window of meiotic prophase can cause localised DSB clustering--a phenomenon that is exacerbated in tel1{Delta} cells due to the dual roles that Tel1 has in DSB interference and meiotic prophase checkpoint control.",
