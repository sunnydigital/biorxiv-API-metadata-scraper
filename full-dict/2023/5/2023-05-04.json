    "abstract": "BackgroundThe coordinated transcriptional regulation of activated T-cells is based on the complex dynamic behavior of signaling networks. Given an external stimulus, T-cell gene expression is characterized by impulse and sustained patterns over the course. Here, we analyzed the temporal pattern of activation across different T-cell populations to develop consensus gene signatures for T-cell activation.\n\nMethodsWe applied a meta-analysis of anti-CD3/CD28 induced CD4+ T-cell activation kinetics of publicly available transcriptomewide time series using a random effects model. We used non-negative matrix factorization, an unsupervised deconvolution method, to infer changes in biological patterns over time. For verification and to further map a wider variety of the T-cell landscape, we performed a time series of transcriptome-wide RNA sequencing on activated blood T-cells. Lastly, we matched the identified consensus biomarker signatures to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data of autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells from 24 patients with large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) to characterize activation status of the cell product before infusion.\n\nResultsWe identified time-resolved gene expression profiles comprising 521 genes of up to 10 disjunct time points during activation and different polarization conditions. The gene signatures include central transcriptional regulators of T-cell activation, representing successive waves as well as sustained patterns of induction. They cover early, intermediate, and late response expression rates across multiple T-cell populations, thus defining consensus biomarker signatures for T-cell activation. Intermediate and late response activation signatures in CAR T-cell infusion products were correlated to immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome.\n\nConclusionIn conclusion, we describe temporally resolved gene expression patterns across T-cell populations. These biomarker signatures are a valuable source for e.g., monitoring transcriptional changes during T-cell activation with a reasonable number of genes, annotating T-cell states in single-cell transcriptome studies or assessing dysregulated functions of human T-cell immunity.",

    "abstract": "Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is a leafy vegetable crop with ongoing breeding efforts related to quality, resilience, and innovative production systems. Genetic variation of important traits in close relatives is necessary to meet lettuce breeding goals. Lactuca virosa (2x=2n=18), a wild relative assigned to the tertiary lettuce gene pool, has a much larger genome (3.7 Gbp) than Lactuca sativa (2.5 Gbp). It has been used in interspecific crosses and is a donor to modern crisphead lettuce cultivars. Here, we present a de novo reference assembly of L. virosa with high continuity and complete gene space. This assembly facilitated comparisons to the genome of L. sativa and to that of the wild species L. saligna, a representative of the secondary lettuce gene pool. To assess the diversity in gene content, we classified the genes of the three Lactuca species as core, accessory and unique. In addition, we identified three interspecific chromosomal inversions compared to L. sativa, which each may cause recombination suppression and thus hamper future introgression breeding. Using three-way comparisons in both reference-based and reference-free manners, we show that the proliferation of long-terminal repeat elements has driven the genome expansion of L. virosa. Further, we performed a genome-wide comparison of immune genes, nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat, and receptor-like kinases among Lactuca spp. and indicate the evolutionary patterns and mechanisms behind their expansions. These genome analyses greatly facilitate the understanding of genetic variation in L. virosa, which is beneficial for the breeding of improved lettuce varieties.",

    "abstract": "High throughput field phenotyping techniques employing multispectral cameras allow to extract a variety of variables and features to predict yield and yield related traits, but little is known about which types of multispectral features may allow to forecast yield potential in the early growth phase. In this study, we hypothesized that the best features for predicting yield in an early stage might be different from the best predictors for the late growth stages. Based on a variety testing trial of 19 European wheat varieties in 2021, multispectral images were taken on 19 dates ranging from tillering to harvest by an unmanned aerial vehicle measuring reflectance in five bands, including visible bands, Red-edge and the near-infrared (NIR). Orthomosaic images were created, and then the single band reflectances, vegetation indices (VI) and texture features (TF) based on a gray level correlation matrix (GLCM) were extracted. We evaluated the performance of these three types of features for yield prediction and classification at different growth stages by, i) using features on each of the measurement dates, ii) smoothing features across the 19 dates, and iii) combining features across the directly adjacent dates, in combination with the random forest models. Our results showed that, for most features, measurements at the flowering stage showed the best performance and the Red reflectance was able to predict yield with a RMSE of 47.4 g m-2 (R2 = 0.63), the best VI was NDRE predicting yield with a RMSE of 47.9 g m-2 (R2 = 0.63), the best TF was contrast predicting yield with a RMSE of 57.2 g m-2 (R2 = 0.46) at the booting stage. Combining dates improved yield prediction in all dates and made the prediction errors more stable across dates. Rather than the Red-edge band, visible bands especially the Red band enabled to distinguish between the high- and low-yielding varieties already in the tillering stage, with a total accuracy of 76.7%. The study confirms our hypothesis and further implies that, in the early stages, the visible bands may be more effective than Red-edge bands in assessing the yield potential in a range of testing varieties.",

    "abstract": "Many autoimmune diseases show flares in which symptoms erupt and then decline. A prominent example is multiple sclerosis (MS) in its relapsing-remitting phase. Mathematical models attempting to capture the flares in multiple sclerosis have often been oscillatory in nature, assuming a regular pattern of symptom flare-ups and remissions. However, this fails to account for the non-periodic nature of flares, which can appear at seemingly random intervals. Here we propose that flares resemble excitable dynamics triggered by stochastic events and show that a minimal mathematical model of autoimmune cells and inhibitory regulatory cells can provide such excitability. In our model, autoimmune response releases antigens that cause autoimmune cells to expand in a positive feedback loop, while regulatory cells inhibit the autoimmune cells in a negative feedback loop. The model can quantitatively explain the decline of MS relapses during pregnancy and their postpartum surge based on lymphocyte dynamics, as well as the decline in MS relapses with age. The model also points to potential therapeutic targets and predicts that even small modulation of regulatory T cell production, removal or activity can have a large effect on relapse rate. Excitable dynamics may underlie flares and relapses found across autoimmune diseases, thus providing an understanding that may help improve treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Glucocorticoids potently inhibit expression of many inflammatory mediators, and have been very widely used to treat both acute and chronic inflammatory diseases for more than seventy years. However, they can have several unwanted effects, amongst which immunosuppression is one of the most common. Here we investigated effects of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone on the responses of primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages to the pro-inflammatory agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS). At the mRNA level, dexamethasone inhibited the LPS-induced expression of more than 100 genes that are involved in cell-intrinsic defence against viral pathogens. Expression of most of the corresponding proteins was also reduced by dexamethasone. This antiviral disarmament occurred at two distinct levels. First, dexamethasone strongly and dose-dependently inhibited the expression of the type I interferon IFN{beta} by LPS-activated macrophages. IFN{beta} mediates an autocrine positive feedback loop in LPS-treated macrophages, promoting the expression of antiviral genes and other interferon-stimulated genes. Hence reduction of IFN{beta} expression contributes to impaired expression of antiviral genes. Dexamethasone also acted downstream of IFN{beta} to inhibit expression of a subset of interferon-regulated genes. We tested a number of hypotheses based on previous publications, but found that no single mechanism could account for more than a small fraction of the broad suppressive impact of dexamethasone on macrophage type I interferon signaling, underlining the complexity of this pathway. Preliminary experiments indicated that dexamethasone exerted similar inhibitory effects on primary human monocyte-derived or alveolar macrophages.",

    "abstract": "Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in the form of H2O2 can act both as physiological signaling molecules as well as damaging agents, depending on its concentration and localization. The downstream biological effects of H2O2 were often studied making use of exogenously added H2O2, generally as a bolus and at supraphysiological levels. But this does not mimic the continuous, low levels of intracellular H2O2 production by for instance mitochondrial respiration. The enzyme D-Amino Acid Oxidase (DAAO) catalyzes H2O2 formation using D-amino acids, which are absent from culture media, as a substrate. Ectopic expression of DAAO has recently been used in several studies to produce inducible and titratable intracellular H2O2. However, a method to directly quantify the amount of H2O2 produced by DAAO has been lacking, making it difficult to assess whether observed phenotypes are the result of physiological or artificially high levels of H2O2. Here we describe a simple assay to directly quantify DAAO activity by measuring the oxygen consumed during H2O2 production. The oxygen consumption rate of DAAO can directly be compared to the basal mitochondrial respiration in the same assay, allowing to estimate whether the ensuing level of H2O2 production is within the range of physiological mitochondrial ROS production. We show that the assay can also be used to select clones that express differently localized DAAO with the same absolute level of H2O2 production to be able to discriminate the effects of H2O2 production at different subcellular locations from differences in total oxidative burden. This method therefore greatly improves the interpretation and applicability of DAAO-based models, thereby moving the redox biology field forward.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities play a critical role in ecological processes, and their diversity is key to their functioning. However, little is known about if communities can regenerate ecological diversity following species removal or extinction, and how the rediversified communities would compare to the original ones. Here we show that simple two-ecotype communities from the E. coli Long Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE) consistently rediversified into two ecotypes following the isolation of one of the ecotypes, coexisting via negative frequency-dependent selection. Communities separated by more than 30,000 generations of evolutionary time rediversify in similar ways. The rediversified ecotype appears to share a number of growth traits with the ecotype it replaces. However, the rediversified community is also different compared to the original community in ways relevant to the mechanism of ecotype coexistence, for example in stationary phase response and survival. We found substantial variation in the transcriptional states between the two original ecotypes, whereas the differences within the rediversified community were comparatively smaller, but with unique patterns of differential expression. Our results suggest that evolution may leave room for alternative diversification processes even in a maximally reduced community of only two strains. We hypothesize that the presence of alternative evolutionary pathways may be even more pronounced in communities of many species, highlighting an important role for perturbations, such as species removal, in evolving ecological communities.",

However, while there has been significant progress in the individual assays being developed, multi-parametric optical sensing of droplets and their encapsulated contents remains challenging. The current common approach of microscopy based high-speed imaging of droplets is technically complex and requires expensive instrumentation limiting their large-scale adoption. Here we have adapted the principles of the widely established technique of flow cytometry to a novel optofluidic setup - the OptiDrop platform, with on-chip detection of scatter and multiple fluorescence signals from microfluidic droplets and their contents using optical fibers. The highly customizable on-chip optical fiber-based signal detection system enables simplified, miniaturized, low-cost, multi-parametric sensing of optical signals with high sensitivity and single cell resolution within each droplet. Our work on differential expression analysis of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) protein in response to IFN{gamma} stimulation further demonstrates the OptiDrop platforms capabilities in sensitively detecting cell surface biomarkers using fluorescently labeled antibodies. The OptiDrop platform thus combines the versatility of flow cytometry with the power of droplet microfluidics to provide wide-ranging optical sensing solutions for research and diagnostics.",

This process involves identifying new therapeutic uses for existing drugs, which can significantly reduce the cost, risk, and time associated with developing new drugs, de novo development. A previous conducted study proved that Deep Learning can be used to streamline this process by identifying drug repurposing hypotheses. The study presented a model called REDIRECTION, which utilized the rich biomedical information available in graph form and combined it with Geometric Deep Learning to find new indications for existing drugs. The reported metrics for this model were 0.87 for AUROC and 0.83 for AUPRC. In this current study, the importance of node features in GNNs is explored. Specifically, the study used GNNs to embed two-dimensional drug molecular structures and obtain corresponding features. These features were incorporated into the drug repurposing graph, along with some other enhancements, resulting in an improved model called DMSR. Performance score for the reported metrics values raised by 0.0448 in AUROC and 0.0919 in AUPRC. Based on these findings, we believe that the method used for embedding drug molecular structures is interesting and captures valuable information about drugs. Its incorporation in the graph for drug repurposing can significantly benefit the process, leading to improved performance evaluation metrics.",

    "abstract": "Rabies, a fatal neurological disease caused by Lyssavirus rabies (RABV), poses a significant threat to public health globally. Despite extensive studies on RABV-induced neuropathology, the involvement of extraneural organs during rabies pathogenesis and the tropisms of wild-type strains to different organs remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the tropism of a dog and bat RABV variant to three different extraneural tissues (kidneys, lungs and liver) and characterized cellular and tissue damage associated with infection in mice over 30 days. Our results reveal that RABV may have a tropism for the kidneys and cause tissue-specific cellular damage. Furthermore, we propose that RABV spreads to extraneural tissues simultaneously with central nervous system (CNS) infection. Understanding the involvement of extraneural organs in rabies pathogenesis may contribute to the development of effective treatment strategies of this fatal disease.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYRabies is a lethal viral infection that targets the nervous system and generally can be transmitted to humans by bites of infected animals. While there has been significant research focused on how the virus damages the brain, little is known about how the infection affects other organs in the periphery. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted an experimental study to investigate the effects of two distinct wild strains of the virus, one isolated from dogs and the other from bats, on the lungs, liver, and kidneys in mice model of infection. Our findings suggest that the rabies virus infection leads to cell death and produces specific lesions in each of these organs, and we hypothesize that rabies virus may spread to these tissues at the same time as the brain, which possible contributes to the disease outcome. These findings enhance our understanding on how rabies virus targets organs outside the nervous system and its pathology in these different systems.",

Acovimab also possesses strong synergistic neutralizing activity against some Omicron variants when combined with Sotrovimab. Polyclonal plasma antibodies from COVID-19 vaccinees who had recovered from SARS-CoV2 infection were shown to possess low neutralizing titers of antibodies against conserved RBD targets of CoV2 variants including XBB.1.5, which also synergistically neutralize with Sotrovimab against this variant.\n\nSummaryThe increasing prevalence of the highly antibody-evasive Omicron sublineages increases the risk of breakthrough infections and leaves high-risk and vulnerable immunocompromised individuals with no effective options for prophylactic or therapeutic antibody treatments. Here, we report a heavily mutated anti-RBD monoclonal antibody, Acovimab, directed against a site in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) region of the CoV2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), that possesses very broad and highly potent neutralizing activity against CoV2 variants, including many Omicron variants. This antibody is derived from the IGHV1-58*01 germline sequence and possesses a relatively high level of mutation (15.5% of the VH aa sequence), which is unusual for anti-RBD antibodies. Neutralizing activity was very potent (IC50s range of 1-9 ng/ml) for early Omicron subvariants that possess an unmutated F486 residue and is retained but less potent (IC50s of 200-650 ng/ml) for more resistant Omicron subvariants which contain the F486V mutation (BA4/5, BA4.6, and BQ1.1), but is lost for the later ultra-resistant variants that contain F486S (XBB) or F486P (XBB.1.5) mutations. Based on these specificities, it is predicted that Acovimab by itself should protect against CoV2 infections other than those caused by the XBB/XBB.1.5 family. Acovimab also shows strong synergy in neutralization when combined with Sotrovimab, which neutralizes all Omicron variants, including XBB.1.5. Plasma from subjects with hybrid immunity (induced by vaccination + infection) possessed low levels of XBB.1.5 RBM-targeting plasma-neutralizing antibodies, and these also neutralized synergistically when combined with Sotrovimab. These results suggest potentially novel immunotherapeutic options for treating most of the CoV2 variants responsible for current infections.",

    "abstract": "Peptidoglycan (PG) is a protective sac-like exoskeleton present in most bacterial cell walls. It is a large, covalently cross-linked mesh-like polymer made up of several glycan strands cross-bridged to each other by short peptide chains. Because PG forms a continuous mesh around the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, opening the mesh is critical to generate space for the incorporation of new material during its expansion. In Escherichia coli, the  space-making activity is known to be achieved by cleavage of cross-links between the glycan strands by a set of redundant PG endopeptidases whose absence leads to rapid lysis and cell death. Here, we demonstrate a hitherto unknown role of glycan strand cleavage in making space for cell wall expansion in E. coli. We find that overexpression of a membrane-bound lytic transglycosylase, MltD that cuts the glycan polymers of the PG sacculus rescues the cell lysis caused by the absence of essential cross-link specific endopeptidases, MepS, MepM and MepH. Further detailed genetic and biochemical analysis revealed that MltD works in conjunction with cross-link specific endopeptidases to expand the PG sacculus. Interestingly, we find that cellular MltD levels are stringently controlled by two independent regulatory pathways. MltD undergoes regulated proteolysis by NlpI-Prc, a periplasmic adaptor-protease complex that specifically degrades two of the elongation-specific endopeptidases, MepS and MepH. In addition, MltD levels are post-transcriptionally controlled by RpoS, a stationary-phase specific sigma factor. Overall, our results show that coordinated cleavage of the glycan strands and the peptide cross-bridges facilitates the opening of the PG mesh for successful expansion of the cell wall during growth of a bacterium.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMost bacteria are protected by a cell wall made up of peptidoglycan (PG), a mesh-like large polymer. PG consists of several linear glycan strands interlinked through short peptide chains to form a continuous meshwork around the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Because PG tightly encases the cytoplasmic membrane, the growth of a bacterial cell is coupled to the expansion of PG requiring the activity of hydrolytic enzymes that cleave PG cross-links to make space for incorporation of new PG material. ln E. coli, a set of redundant cross-link specific endopeptidases are known to be crucial for expansion of PG. In this study, we show that cleavage of the glycan polymers by MltD, a glycan cleaving enzyme compensates the absence of cross-link cleavage and contributes to the expansion of PG. Overall, our work shows a previously unknown role of glycan hydrolases in cell wall expansion identifying these as potential targets for development of cell wall-specific antimicrobial agents.",

    "abstract": "Legionella are natural inhabitants of building plumbing biofilms, where interactions with other microorganisms influence their survival, proliferation, and death. Here, we investigated the associations of Legionella with prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbiomes in biofilm samples extracted from 85 shower hoses of a multiunit residential building. Legionella spp. relative abundance in the biofilms ranged between 0 - 7.8%, of which only 0 - 0.46% was L. pneumophila. Our data suggest that some microbiome members were associated with high (e.g., Chthonomonas, Vrihiamoeba) or low (e.g., Aquabacterium, Vannella) Legionella relative abundance. The correlations of the different Legionella variants (30 Zero-Radius OTUs detected) showed distinct patterns, suggesting separate ecological niches occupied by different Legionella species. This study provides insights into the ecology of Legionella with respect to: 1) the colonization of a high number of real shower hoses biofilm samples; 2) the ecological meaning of associations between Legionella and co-occurring prokaryotic/eukaryotic organisms; 3) critical points and future directions of microbial-interaction-based-ecological-investigations.",

Here, we updated the mucosal vaccine for Omicron variants by creating ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-BA.5-S, which encodes for a pre- fusion and surface-stabilized S protein of the BA.5 strain, and then tested monovalent and bivalent vaccines for efficacy against circulating variants including BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5. Whereas monovalent ChAd-vectored vaccines effectively induced systemic and mucosal antibody responses against matched strains, the bivalent ChAd-vectored vaccine elicited greater breadth. However, serum neutralizing antibody responses induced by both monovalent and bivalent vaccines were poor against the antigenically distant XBB.1.5 Omicron strain and did not protect in passive transfer experiments. Nonetheless, nasally delivered bivalent ChAd- vectored vaccines induced robust antibody and spike-specific memory T cell responses in the respiratory mucosa, and conferred protection against WA1/2020 D614G and Omicron variants BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5 in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of both mice and hamsters.

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), one of the most common forms of interstitial lung disease, is a poorly understood and fatal condition with only two FDA-approved medications. As a chronic fibroproliferative disorder, the pathobiology of the fibroblast in IPF is critical to the evaluation and discovery of novel therapeutics. Unfortunately, our ability to interrogate this biology in vitro is greatly limited by the well-documented effect of tissue culture plastic on the fibroblast phenotype. Using decellularized IPF-derived lung matrix, we characterize the phenotype of fibroblasts seeded into three-dimensional (3D) fibrotic hydrogels. We identify differential gene expression and differential contractility in IPF fibroblasts as compared to their normal counterparts. Additionally, fibroblasts seeded into these matrices lose the classical myofibroblast marker, smooth muscle actin, and gain significant expression of proinflammatory cytokines compared to 2D tissue culture dishes. In a series of co-culture studies with monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages, we validate this proinflammatory state. The application of this 3D fibrotic hydrogel model for the potential intervention in disease associated fibroblast-immune cell crosstalk may uncover a novel therapeutic avenue. These findings add to a growing understanding of the lung microenvironment effect on fibroblast phenotypes and shed new light on the potential role of fibroblasts as immune signaling hubs during lung fibrosis.",

It binds to and impedes the transcription of extrachromosomal DNA templates; an ability which is lost upon chromosomal DNA integration. How the complex distinguishes among different DNA templates is unknown. Here we show that, in human cells, Smc5/6 preferentially binds to circular rather than linear extrachromosomal DNA. We further show that this binding is unlikely due to differences in the chromatin composition. Instead, the transcriptional process, per se, and more specifically the accumulation of DNA secondary structures known to be substrates for topoisomerases, is responsible for Smc5/6 recruitment. Those findings, in conjunction with our genome-wide Smc5/6 binding analysis showing that Smc5/6 localizes at few but highly transcribe chromosome loci, reveal a previously unforeseen role of Smc5/6 in DNA topology management during transcription.",

    "abstract": "A targeted double-strand break introduced into the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is repaired by the relatively error-prone nonhomologous-end joining (NHEJ) pathway when homologous recombination is not an option. A ZFN cleavage site was inserted out-of-frame into the LYS2 locus of a haploid yeast strain to study the genetic control of NHEJ when the ends contain 5' overhangs. Repair events that destroyed the cleavage site were identified either as Lys+ colonies on selective medium or as surviving colonies on rich medium. Junction sequences in Lys+ events solely reflected NHEJ and were influenced by the nuclease activity of Mre11 as well as by the presence/absence of the NHEJ-specific polymerase Pol4 and the translesion-synthesis DNA polymerases Pol {sigma} and Pol 11. Although most NHEJ events were dependent on Pol4, a 29-bp deletion with endpoints in 3-bp repeats was an exception. The Pol4-independent deletion required TLS polymerases as well as the exonuclease activity of the replicative Pol DNA polymerase. Survivors were equally split between NHEJ events and 1 kb or 11 kb deletions that reflected microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). MMEJ events required the processive resection activity of Exo1/Sgs1, but there unexpectedly was no dependence on the Rad1-Rad10 endonuclease for the removal of presumptive 3' tails. Finally, NHEJ was more efficient in non-growing than in growing cells and was most efficient in G0 cells. These studies provide novel insight into the flexibility and complexity of error-prone DSB repair in yeast.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAmblyomma americanum, a known vector of multiple tick-borne pathogens, has expanded its geographic distribution across the United States in the past decades. Tick microbiomes may play a role shaping their hosts life history and vectorial capacity. Bacterial communities associated with A. americanum may reflect, or enable, geographic expansion and studying the microbiota will improve understanding of tick- borne disease ecology. We examined the microbiota structure of 189 adult ticks collected in four regions encompassing their historical and current geographic distribution. Both geographic region of origin and sex were significant predictors of alpha diversity. As in other tick models, within-sample diversity was low and uneven given the presence of dominant endosymbionts. Beta diversity analyses revealed that bacterial profiles of ticks of both sexes collected in the West were significantly different from those of the Historic range. Biomarkers were identified for all regions except the historical range. In addition, Bray-Curtis dissimilarities overall increased with distance between sites. Relative quantification of ecological processes showed that, for females and males, respectively, drift and dispersal limitation were the primary drivers of community assembly. Collectively, our findings highlight how microbiota structural variance discriminates the western-expanded populations of A. americanum ticks from the Historical range. Spatial autocorrelation, and particularly the detection of non- selective ecological processes, are indicative of geographic isolation. Our conclusions demonstrate the value of synergistic analysis of biogeographic and microbial ecology data in investigating range expansion in A. americanum and potentially other tick vectors as well.\n\nImportanceThe incidence of tick-borne diseases is on the rise worldwide, including in the United States. This increase in cases is in large part due to the geographic expansion of tick vectors. Among them is the Lone Star tick, Amblyomma americanum, and understanding the factors driving its recent expansion is important for risk assessment and tick population control. Climate change and human activities have previously been posited to be main driving forces for their expansion. New sources of relevant biological data can further our understanding of this phenomenon. Microbial communities associated with ticks include bacteria that affect pathogen transmission and tick behaviors. Here, we investigated whether bacterial community and geographic location data could be combined to better understand the expansion of A. americanum populations. Its not clear whether differences in the microbiota are reflective of or facilitating expansion, but our findings suggest this approach is promising and warrants further investigation.",

Here we investigate the role of CTCF, a master chromatin conformation regulator, in regulating escape from XCI. CTCF binding profiles and epigenetic features were systematically examined at constitutive and facultative escape genes using mouse allelic systems to distinguish the inactive X (Xi) and active X (Xa) chromosomes.\n\nResultsWe found that escape genes are located inside domains flanked by convergent arrays of CTCF binding sites, consistent with the formation of loops. In addition, strong and divergent CTCF binding sites often located at the boundaries between escape genes and adjacent neighbors subject to XCI would help insulate domains. Facultative escapees show clear differences in CTCF binding dependent on their XCI status in specific cell types/tissues. Concordantly, deletion but not inversion of a CTCF binding site at the boundary between the facultative escape gene Car5b and its silent neighbor Siah1b resulted in loss of Car5b escape. Reduced CTCF binding and enrichment of a repressive mark over Car5b in cells with a boundary deletion indicated loss of looping and insulation. In mutant lines in which either the Xi-specific compact structure or its H3K27me3 enrichment was disrupted, escape genes showed an increase in gene expression and associated active marks, supporting the roles of the 3D Xi structure and heterochromatic marks in constraining levels of escape.\n\nConclusionOur findings indicate that escape from XCI is modulated both by looping and insulation of chromatin via convergent arrays of CTCF binding sites and by compaction and epigenetic features of the surrounding heterochromatin.",

    "abstract": "Decreasing the expression of very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 3 (ACSVL3) in U87MG glioblastoma cells by either RNA interference or genomic knockout (KO) significantly decreased their growth rate in culture, as well as their ability to form rapidly growing tumors in mice. U87-KO cells grew at a 9-fold slower rate than U87MG cells. When injected subcutaneously in nude mice, the tumor initiation frequency of U87-KO cells was 70% of that of U87MG cells, and the average growth rate of tumors that did form was decreased by 9-fold. Two hypotheses to explain the decreased growth rate of KO cells were investigated. Lack of ACSVL3 could reduce cell growth either by increasing apoptosis, or via effects on the cell cycle. We examined intrinsic, extrinsic, and caspase-independent apoptosis pathways; none were affected by lack of ACSVL3. However, significant differences in the cell cycle were seen in KO cells, suggesting arrest in S-phase. Levels of cyclin-dependent kinases 1, 2, and 4 were elevated in U87-KO cells, as were regulatory proteins p21 and p53 that promote cell cycle arrest. In contrast, lack of ACSVL3 reduced the level of the inhibitory regulatory protein p27. {gamma}-H2AX, a marker of DNA double strand breaks, was elevated in U87-KO cells, while pH3, a mitotic index marker, was reduced. Previously reported alterations in sphingolipid metabolism in ACSVL3-depleted U87 cells may explain the effect of KO on cell cycle. These studies reinforce the notion that ACSVL3 is a promising therapeutic target in glioblastoma.",

Microsecond atomistic simulations provided a detailed characterization of the conformational landscapes and revealed the increased thermodynamic stabilization of the BA.2 variant which is contrasted with the BA.4/BA.5 variants inducing a significant mobility of the complexes. Using ensemble-based mutational scanning of binding interactions, we identified binding affinity and structural stability hotspots in the Omicron complexes. Perturbation response scanning and network-based mutational profiling approaches probed the effect of the Omicron variants on allosteric communications. The results of this analysis revealed specific roles of Omicron mutations as \"plastic and evolutionary adaptable\" modulators of binding and allostery which are coupled to the major regulatory positions through interaction networks. Through perturbation network scanning of allosteric residue potentials in the Omicron variant complexes, which is performed in the background of the original strain, we identified that the key Omicron binding affinity hotspots N501Y and Q498R could mediate allosteric interactions and epistatic couplings. Our results suggested that the synergistic role of these hotspots in controlling stability, binding and allostery can enable for compensatory balance of fitness tradeoffs with conformationally and evolutionary adaptable immune-escape Omicron mutations. Through integrative computational approaches, this study provides a systematic analysis of the effects of Omicron mutations on thermodynamics, binding and allosteric signaling in the complexes with ACE2 receptor. The findings support a mechanism in which Omicron mutations can evolve to balance thermodynamic stability and conformational adaptability in order to ensure proper tradeoff between stability, binding and immune escape.",

    "abstract": "Performing photosynthesis in the desert is a challenging task since it requires a fast adaptation to extreme illumination and temperature changes. To understand adaptive mechanisms, we purified Photosystem II (PSII) from Chlorella ohadii, a green alga from the desert soil surface, and identified structural elements that might enable the photosystem functioning under harsh conditions. The 2.72 [A] cryogenic electron-microscopy (cryoEM) structure of PSII exhibited 64 subunits, encompassing 386 chlorophylls, 86 carotenoids, four plastoquinones, and several structural lipids. At the luminal side of PSII, the oxygen evolving complex was protected by a unique subunit arrangement - PsbO (OEE1), PsbP (OEE2), CP47, and PsbU (plant OEE3 homolog). PsbU interacted with PsbO, CP43, and PsbP, thus stabilising the oxygen evolving shield. Substantial changes were observed on the stromal electron acceptor side - PsbY was identified as a transmembrane helix situated alongside PsbF and PsbE enclosing cytochrome b559, supported by the adjacent C-terminal helix of Psb10. These four transmembrane helices bundled jointly, shielding cytochrome b559 from the solvent. The bulk of Psb10 formed a cap protecting the quinone site and probably contributed to the PSII stacking. So far, the C. ohadii PSII structure is the most complete description of the complex, suggesting numerous future experiments. A protective mechanism that prevented QB from rendering itself fully reduced is proposed.",

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic mRNA life cycle includes transcription, nuclear mRNA export and degradation. To quantify all these processes simultaneously, we perform thiol-linked alkylation after metabolic labeling of RNA with 4-thiouridine (4sU), followed by sequencing of RNA (SLAM-seq) in the nuclear and cytosolic compartments. We develop a model that reliably quantifies mRNA synthesis, nuclear export, and nuclear and cytosolic degradation rates on a genome-wide scale. We find that nuclear degradation of polyadenylated mRNA is negligible and nuclear mRNA export is slow, while cytosolic mRNA degradation is comparatively fast. Consequently, an mRNA molecule generally spends most of its life in the nucleus. We also observe large differences in the nuclear export rates of different 3UTR transcript isoforms. Furthermore, we identify genes whose expression is abruptly induced upon metabolic labeling. These transcripts are exported substantially faster than average mRNAs, suggesting the existence of alternative export pathways. Our results highlight nuclear mRNA export as a limiting factor in mRNA metabolism and gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Crohns disease (CD) is marked by recurring intestinal inflammation and tissue injury, often resulting in fibro-stenosis and bowel obstruction, necessitating surgical intervention with high recurrence rates. To elucidate complex intercellular interactions leading to fibro-stenosis in CD, we analysed the transcriptome of cells isolated from the transmural ileum of CD patients, including a trio of lesions from each patient: non-affected, inflamed, and stenotic ileum samples, and compared them with samples from non-CD patients. Our computational analysis revealed that pro-fibrotic signals from a subset of monocyte-derived cells expressing CD150 induce a disease-specific fibroblast population, resulting in chronic inflammation and tissue fibrosis. The transcription factor TWIST1 was identified as a key modulator of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) production. Therapeutic inhibition of TWIST1 inhibits fibroblast activation, reducing ECM production and deposition. These findings suggest that the myeloid-stromal axis may offer a promising therapeutic target to prevent fibro-stenosis in CD.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial AB toxins are secreted virulence factors that are internalized by target cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis, translocating their enzymatic domain to the cytosol from endosomes (short-trip) or the endoplasmic reticulum (long-trip). To accomplish this, they evolved a multidomain structure organized into either a single polypeptide chain or non-covalently associated polypeptide chains. The prototypical short-trip single-chain toxin is characterized by a receptor-binding domain that confers cellular specificity and a translocation domain responsible for pore formation whereby the catalytic domain translocates to the cytosol in an endosomal acidification-dependent way.\n\nIn this work, the resolution of the three-dimensional structure of AIP56 showed that instead of a two-domain organization, as previously predicted, AIP56 has a three-domain organization, with a NleC-like catalytic domain associated with a small middle domain that contains the linker-peptide, followed by the receptor-binding domain. In contrast to prototypical single-chain AB toxins, AIP56 does not comprise a typical structurally complex translocation domain; instead, the elements involved in translocation are scattered across its domains. Thus, the catalytic domain contains a helical hairpin that serves as a molecular switch for triggering the conformational changes necessary for membrane insertion only with endosomal acidification, whereas the middle and receptor-binding domains are required for pore formation. Considering the increasing number of putative AIP56 homologous toxins in databases, the data presented here have implications far beyond the AIP56 intoxication process and the virulence of Phdp.",

    "abstract": "With the aim of broadening immune responses against the evolving SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants, bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines that encode the ancestral and Omicron BA.5 spike proteins have been authorized for clinical use, supplanting the original monovalent counterpart in numerous countries. However, recent studies have demonstrated that administering either a monovalent or bivalent vaccine as a fourth vaccine dose results in similar neutralizing antibody titers against the latest Omicron subvariants, raising the possibility of immunological imprinting. Utilizing binding immunoassays, pseudotyped virus neutralization assays, and antigenic mapping, we investigated antibody responses from 72 participants who received three monovalent mRNA vaccine doses followed by either a bivalent or monovalent booster, or who experienced breakthrough infections with the BA.5 or BQ subvariant after vaccinations with an original monovalent vaccine. Compared to a monovalent booster, the bivalent booster did not yield noticeably higher binding titers to D614G, BA.5, and BQ.1.1 spike proteins, nor higher virus-neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV-2 variants including the predominant XBB.1.5 and the emergent XBB.1.16. However, sera from breakthrough infection cohorts neutralized Omicron subvariants significantly better. Multiple analyses of these results, including antigenic mapping, made clear that inclusion of the ancestral spike prevents the broadening of antibodies to the BA.5 component in the bivalent vaccine, thereby defeating its intended goal. Our findings suggest that the ancestral spike in the current bivalent COVID-19 vaccine is the cause of deep immunological imprinting. Its removal from future vaccine compositions is therefore strongly recommended.",

    "abstract": "NLR family, apoptosis inhibitory proteins (NAIPs) detect bacterial flagellin and structurally related components of bacterial type III secretion systems (T3SS), and recruit NLR family, CARD domain containing protein 4 (NLRC4) and caspase-1 into an inflammasome complex that induces pyroptosis. NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome assembly is initiated by the binding of a single NAIP to its cognate ligand, but a subset of bacterial flagellins or T3SS structural proteins are thought to evade NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome sensing by not binding to their cognate NAIPs. Unlike other inflammasome components such as NLRP3, AIM2, or some NAIPs, NLRC4 is constitutively present in resting macrophages, and not thought to be regulated by inflammatory signals. Here, we demonstrate that Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation upregulates NLRC4 transcription and protein expression in murine macrophages, which licenses NAIP detection of evasive ligands. TLR-induced NLRC4 upregulation and NAIP detection of evasive ligands required p38 MAPK signaling. In contrast, TLR priming in human macrophages did not upregulate NLRC4 expression, and human macrophages remained unable to detect NAIP-evasive ligands even following priming. Critically, ectopic expression of either murine or human NLRC4 was sufficient to induce pyroptosis in response to immunoevasive NAIP ligands, indicating that increased levels of NLRC4 enable the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome to detect these normally evasive ligands. Altogether, our data reveal that TLR priming tunes the threshold for NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome activation and enables inflammasome responses against immunoevasive or suboptimal NAIP ligands.\n\nSignificance StatementCytosolic receptors in the neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein (NAIP) family detect bacterial flagellin and components of the type III secretion system (T3SS). NAIP binding to its cognate ligand engages the adaptor molecule NLRC4 to form NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasomes culminating in inflammatory cell death. However, some bacterial pathogens evade NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome detection, thus bypassing a crucial barrier of the immune system. Here, we find that, in murine macrophages, TLR-dependent p38 MAPK signaling increases NLRC4 expression, thereby lowering the threshold for NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome activation in response to immunoevasive NAIP ligands. Human macrophages were unable to undergo priming-induced upregulation of NLRC4 and could not detect immunoevasive NAIP ligands. These findings provide a new insight into species-specific regulation of the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic loss-of-function SCN1A variants cause a spectrum of seizure disorders. We previously identified variants in individuals with SCN1A-related epilepsy that fall in or near a poison exon (PE) in SCN1A intron 20 (20N). We hypothesized these variants lead to increased PE inclusion, which introduces a premature stop codon, and, therefore, reduced abundance of the full-length SCN1A transcript and Nav1.1 protein. We used a splicing reporter assay to interrogate PE inclusion in HEK293T cells. In addition, we used patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiated into neurons to quantify 20N inclusion by long and short-read sequencing and Nav1.1 abundance by western blot. We performed RNA-antisense purification with mass spectrometry to identify RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that could account for the aberrant PE splicing. We demonstrate that variants in/near 20N lead to increased 20N inclusion by long-read sequencing or splicing reporter assay and decreased Nav1.1 abundance. We also identified 28 RBPs that differentially interact with variant constructs compared to wild-type, including SRSF1 and HNRNPL. We propose a model whereby 20N variants disrupt RBP binding to splicing enhancers (SRSF1) and suppressors (HNRNPL), to favor PE inclusion. Overall, we demonstrate that SCN1A 20N variants cause haploinsufficiency and SCN1A-related epilepsies. This work provides insights into the complex control of RBP-mediated PE alternative splicing, with broader implications for PE discovery and identification of pathogenic PE variants in other genetic conditions.",

In this study, a N-carbamoyl-{beta}-alanine amidohydrolase encoding gene from Rhizobium radiobacter MDC 8606 was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant enzyme (RrC{beta}AA) showed a specific activity of 14 U/mg using N-carbamoyl-{beta}-alanine as a substrate with an optimum activity of 55{degrees}C at pH 8.0. In this work, we report also the first prokaryotic N-carbamoyl-{beta}-alanine amidohydrolases structure at a resolution of 2.0 [A]. A discontinuous catalytic domain and a dimerization domain attached through a flexible hinge region at the domain interface has been revealed. We have found that the ligand is interacting with a conserved glutamic acid (Glu131), histidine (H385) and arginine (Arg291) residues. Studies let us to explain the preference on the enzyme for linear carbamoyl substrates as large carbamoyl substrates cannot fit in the active site of the enzyme. This work envisages the use of RrC{beta}AA from the Rhizobium radiobacter MDC 8606 for the industrial production of L--, L-{beta}-, and L-{gamma} - amino acids. The structural analysis provides new insights on enzyme-substrate interaction, which shed light on engineering of N-carbamoyl-{beta}-alanine amidohydrolases for high catalytic activity and broad substrate specificity.",

The highresolution crystal structure and the cryo-EM density map of the LAT-1-TOL-1 ectodomain complex reveal a previously-unobserved mode of one-to-one interaction enabled by a large interface.

    "abstract": "Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the auditory startle response is the gold standard operational measure of sensorimotor gating. Affected by various neurological and neuropsychiatric illnesses, PPI also declines during aging. While PPI deficits are often associated with cognitive overload, attention impairments and motor dysfunctions, their reversal is routinely used in experimental systems for drug screening. Yet, the cellular and circuit-level mechanisms of PPI remain unclear, even under non-pathological conditions. Recent evidence shows that neurons located in the brainstem caudal pontine reticular nucleus (PnC) expressing the glycine transporter type 2 (GlyT2+) receive inputs from the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and contribute to PPI via an uncharted pathway. Using tract-tracing and immunohistochemical analyses in GlyT2-eGFP mice, we reveal the neuroanatomical location of CeA glutamatergic neurons innervating GlyT2+ neurons. Our precise in vitro optogenetic manipulations coupled to field electrophysiological recordings demonstrate that CeA glutamatergic inputs do suppress auditory neurotransmission in PnC neurons but not via action on transmitter release from auditory afferents. Rather, our data is consistent with excitatory drive onto GlyT2+ neurons. Indeed, our PPI experiments in vivo demonstrate that optogenetic activation of GlyT2+ PnC neurons increases PPI and is sufficient to induce PPI, clarifying the crucial role of these neurons in young GlyT2-Cre mice. In contrast, in older GlyT2-Cre mice, PPI is reduced and not further altered by optogenetic inhibition of GlyT2+ neurons. We conclude that GlyT2+ PnC neurons innervated by CeA glutamatergic inputs are crucial for PPI and we highlight their reduced activity during the age-dependent decline in PPI.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSensorimotor gating is a pre-attentive mechanism that declines with age and that is affected by neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle commonly measures sensorimotor gating to assess cognitive and motor symptoms and to screen drug efficacy. Yet, the neuronal mechanisms underlying PPI are still unresolved, limiting therapeutic advances. Here, we identify brainstem glycinergic neurons essential for PPI using tract tracing, in vitro electrophysiology and precise in vivo optogenetic manipulations during startle measurements in mice. Innervated by amygdala glutamatergic inputs, we show that these glycinergic neurons are essential and sufficient to induce PPI in young mice. In contrast, these neurons do not contribute to PPI in older mice. We provide new insights to the theoretical construct of PPI.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria-rich brown adipocytes dissipate cellular fuel as heat by thermogenic energy expenditure (TEE). Prolonged nutrient excess or cold exposure impair TEE and contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity, but the mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here we report that stress-induced proton leak into the matrix interface of mitochondrial innermembrane (IM) mobilizes a group of proteins from IM into matrix, which in turn alter mitochondrial bioenergetics. We further determine a smaller subset that correlates with obesity in human subcutaneous adipose tissue. We go on to show that the top factor on this short list, acyl-CoA thioesterase 9 (ACOT9), migrates from the IM into the matrix upon stress where it enzymatically deactivates and prevents the utilization of acetyl-CoA in TEE. The loss of ACOT9 protects mice against the complications of obesity by maintaining unobstructed TEE. Overall, our results introduce aberrant protein translocation as a strategy to identify pathogenic factors.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryThermogenic stress impairs mitochondrial energy utilization by forcing translocation of IM-bound proteins into the matrix.",

In addition, smaller regional variants are linked to wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders, underscoring the genes essential role in brain development. Like many essential neurodevelopmental genes, AUTS2 is large and complex, generating distinct long (AUTS2-l) and short (AUTS2-s) protein isoforms from alternative promoters. Although evidence suggests unique isoform functions, the contributions of each isoform to specific AUTS2-linked phenotypes have not been clearly resolved. Furthermore, Auts2 is widely expressed across the developing brain, but cell populations most central to disease presentation have not been determined. In this study, we focused on the specific roles of AUTS2-l in brain development, behavior, and postnatal brain gene expression, showing that brain-wide AUTS2-l ablation leads to specific subsets of the recessive pathologies associated with C-terminal mutations that disrupt both isoforms. We identify downstream genes that could explain expressed phenotypes including hundreds of putative direct AUTS2- l target genes. Furthermore, in contrast to C-terminal Auts2 mutations which lead to dominant hypoactivity, AUTS2-l loss-of-function is associated with dominant hyperactivity, a phenotype exhibited by many human patients. Finally, we show that AUTS2-l ablation in Calbindin 1-expressing cell lineages is sufficient to yield learning/memory deficits and hyperactivity with abnormal dentate gyrus granule cell maturation, but not other phenotypic effects. These data provide new clues to in vivo AUTS2-l functions and novel information relevant to genotype-phenotype correlations in the human AUTS2 region.",

These studies have identified a small number of traits that show genetic sex differences on a global level. However, such global analyses cannot elucidate the local architecture of genetic sex differences6. To address this gap and gain insight into local (dis-)similarities in genetic signal between males and females, we estimated local genetic correlations and tested whether these differ from one, compared local heritability estimates, and tested for equality of local genetic effects in 157 quantitative traits. While the vast majority of loci do not significantly differ between males and females, almost every trait we studied had at least one locus that did. We show that these loci can highlight trait-relevant biology and may partly explain observed phenotypic sex differences.",

Confirmation analyses were carried out by Sanger sequencing and included samples from other family members.\n\nResultsOur data revealed a novel heterozygous g.10924C>A variant on the ABO*A-allele located in the transcription factor binding site for RUNX1 in intron 1 (+5.8 kb site). Inheritance was shown by the results of the donors mother, who shared the novel variant and the anti-A specific mixed-field agglutination.\n\nConclusionWe discovered a regulatory variant in the 8-bp RUNX1 motif of ABO, which extends current knowledge of three other variants affecting the same motif and also leading to A3 or B3 phenotypes.

LRS provides significant advantages over short-read sequencing approaches, including phased de novo genome assembly, access to previously excluded genomic regions, and discovery of more complex structural variants (SVs) associated with disease. Limitations remain with respect to cost, scalability, and platform-dependent read accuracy and the tradeoffs between sequence coverage and sensitivity of variant discovery are important experimental considerations for the application of LRS. We compare the genetic variant calling precision and recall of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and PacBio HiFi platforms over a range of sequence coverages. For read-based applications, LRS sensitivity begins to plateau around 12-fold coverage with a majority of variants called with reasonable accuracy (F1 score above 0.5), and both platforms perform well for SV detection. Genome assembly increases variant calling precision and recall of SVs and indels in HiFi datasets with HiFi outperforming ONT in quality as measured by the F1 score of assembly-based variant callsets.

    "abstract": "2.The dominant paradigm for analysing genetic variation relies on a central idea: all genomes in a species can be described as minor differences from a single reference genome. However, this approach can be problematic or inadequate for bacteria, where there can be significant sequence divergence within a species.\n\nReference graphs are an emerging solution to the reference bias issues implicit in the \"single-reference\" model. Such a graph represents variation at multiple scales within a population - e.g., nucleotide- and locus-level.\n\nThe genetic causes of drug resistance in bacteria have proven comparatively easy to decode compared with studies of human diseases. For example, it is possible to predict resistance to numerous anti-tuberculosis drugs by simply testing for the presence of a list of single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertion/deletions, commonly referred to as a catalogue.\n\nWe developed DrPRG (Drug resistance Prediction with Reference Graphs) using the bacterial reference graph method Pandora. First, we outline the construction of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance reference graph, a process that can be replicated for other species. The graph is built from a global dataset of isolates with varying drug susceptibility profiles, thus capturing common and rare resistance- and susceptible-associated haplotypes. We benchmark DrPRG against the existing graph-based tool Mykrobe and the haplotype-based approach of TBProfiler using 44,709 and 138 publicly available Illumina and Nanopore samples with associated phenotypes. We find DrPRG has significantly improved sensitivity and specificity for some drugs compared to these tools, with no significant decreases. It uses significantly less computational memory than both tools, and provides significantly faster runtimes, except when runtime is compared to Mykrobe on Nanopore data.\n\nWe discover and discuss novel insights into resistance-conferring variation for M. tuberculosis - including deletion of genes katG and pncA - and suggest mutations that may warrant reclassification as associated with resistance.\n\n3. Impact statementMycobacterium tuberculosis is the bacterium responsible for tuberculosis (TB). TB is one of the leading causes of death worldwide; before the coronavirus pandemic it was the leading cause of death from a single pathogen. Drug-resistant TB incidence has recently increased, making the detection of resistance even more vital. In this study, we develop a new software tool to predict drug resistance from whole-genome sequence data of the pathogen using new reference graph models to represent a reference genome. We evaluate it on M. tuberculosis against existing tools for resistance prediction and show improved performance. Using our method, we discover new resistance-associated variations and discuss reclassification of a selection of existing mutations. As such, this work contributes to TB drug resistance diagnostic efforts. In addition, the method could be applied to any bacterial species, so is of interest to anyone working on antimicrobial resistance.\n\n4.

    "abstract": "BackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating illness that affects millions of individuals worldwide. While chronic stress increases incidence levels of MDD, stress-mediated disruptions in brain function that precipitate the disorder remain elusive. Serotonin-associated antidepressants (ADs) remain the first line of therapy for many with MDD, yet low remission rates and delays between treatment and symptomatic alleviation have prompted skepticism regarding precise roles for serotonin in the precipitation of MDD. Our group recently demonstrated that serotonin epigenetically modifies histone proteins (H3K4me3Q5ser) to regulate transcriptional permissiveness in brain. However, this phenomenon has not yet been explored following stress and/or AD exposures.\n\nMethodsHere, we employed a combination of genome-wide (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq) and western blotting analyses in dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of male and female mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress to examine the impact of stress exposures on H3K4me3Q5ser dynamics in DRN, as well as associations between the mark and stress-induced gene expression. Stress-induced regulation of H3K4me3Q5ser levels were also assessed in the context of AD exposures, and viral-mediated gene therapy was employed to manipulate H3K4me3Q5ser levels to examine the impact of reducing the mark in DRN on stress-associated gene expression and behavior.\n\nResultsWe found that H3K4me3Q5ser plays important roles in stress-mediated transcriptional plasticity in DRN. Mice exposed to chronic stress displayed dysregulated dynamics of H3K4me3Q5ser in DRN, and viral-mediated attenuation of these dynamics rescued stress-mediated gene expression programs and behavior.\n\nConclusionsThese findings establish a neurotransmission-independent role for serotonin in stress-associated transcriptional and behavioral plasticity in DRN.",

However, the cellular and molecular substrates underlying this dysfunction remain unknown. Here, cell-population-specific chromatin accessibility profiling in human OFC unexpectedly mapped genetic risk for MDD exclusively to non-neuronal cells, and transcriptomic analyses revealed significant glial dysregulation in this region. Characterization of MDD-specific cis-regulatory elements identified ZBTB7A - a transcriptional regulator of astrocyte reactivity - as an important mediator of MDD-specific chromatin accessibility and gene expression. Genetic manipulations in mouse OFC demonstrated that astrocytic Zbtb7a is both necessary and sufficient to promote behavioral deficits, cell-type-specific transcriptional and chromatin profiles, and OFC neuronal hyperexcitability induced by chronic stress - a major risk factor for MDD.

Like songbirds, parrots have a nucleated neural song system, but because the two sister groups diverged over 50 million years ago it remains unknown if the song systems operate according to similar principles. Here we established a neuroscience-compatible call-and-response behavioral paradigm to elicit learned contact calls in budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus). Using variational autoencoder-based machine learning methods, we show that contact calls within affiliated groups converge but that individuals maintain unique acoustic features, or vocal signatures, even after call convergence. Next, we transiently and reversibly inactivated the outputs of the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) as animals engaged in call-and-response interactions. Contact call pitch modulation, stereotypy and acoustic structure were dramatically degraded, resulting in the loss of individually unique features of the vocal signature. These results are in stark contrast to results from songbirds, where AFP inactivations with identical methods have the opposite result of increasing the stereotypy of learned vocalizations and retaining acoustic structure. Together, our results show that the anterior pathways of parrots and songbirds have different functional organization and that parrot frontal cortical circuits are necessary for individually unique features of vocal communication.",

    "abstract": "During programmed cell death, it is commonly accepted that macrophages are recruited by apoptotic cells to complete cell degradation. Interdigital cell death, a classical model of developmental cell death, contributes to digit individualization in limbs of mammals and other vertebrates. Here we show that macrophages are present in interdigits before significant cell death occurs and remain after apoptosis inhibition. The typical interdigital phagocytic activity was not observed after a partial depletion of macrophages and was markedly reduced by engulfment/phagosome maturation inhibition, as detected by its association with high lysosomal activity. {beta}-galactosidase activity in this region was also coupled with phagocytosis, against its relationship with cellular senescence. Interdigital phagocytosis correlated with high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), common in embryo regions carrying abundant cell death, suggesting that macrophages are the major source of ROS. ROS generation was dependent on NADPH oxidases and blood vessel integrity, but not directly associated with lysosomal activity. Therefore, macrophages prepattern regions where abundant cell death is going to occur, and their activation causes high lysosomal activity and the generation of ROS by an oxidative burst-like phenomenon.\n\nSummary statementRecruitment of macrophages to the interdigital regions is not linked to apoptosis initiation and they phagocytize by a mechanism involving an oxidative burst-like phenomenon.",
