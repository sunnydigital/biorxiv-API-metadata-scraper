    "abstract": "MotivationProfiling neurons by their electrophysiological phenotype is essential for understanding their roles in information coding within and beyond the nervous systems. Technological development has unleashed our power to record neurons more than ever before, yet the booming size of the dataset poses new challenges for data analysis. Current software tools require users to have either significant programming knowledge or to devote great time and effort, which impedes their prevalence and adoption among experimentalists. To address this problem, here we present ElecFeX, a MATLAB-based graphical user interface designed for a more accessible and efficient analysis of single-cell electrophysiological recordings. ElecFeX has a simple and succinct graphical layout to enable effortless handling of large datasets. This tool includes a set of customizable methods for most common electrophysiological features, and these methods can process multiple files all at once in a reliable and reproducible manner. The output is assembled in a properly formatted file which is exportable for further analysis such as statistical comparison and clustering. By providing such a streamlined and user-friendly open-sourced interface, we hope ElecFeX can benefit broader users for their studies associated with neural activity.\n\nSummaryCharacterizing neurons by their electrophysiological phenotypes is essential for understanding the neural basis of behavioral and cognitive functions. Recent developments in electrode technologies have enabled the collection of hundreds of neural recordings; that necessitated the development of new toolkits capable of performing feature extraction efficiently. To address this urgent need for a powerful and accessible tool, we present ElecFeX, an open-source MATLAB-based toolbox that (1) has a succinct and intuitive graphical user interface, (2) provides generalized methods for wide-ranging electrophysiological features, (3) processes large-size dataset effortlessly, and (4) yields formatted output for further analysis such as neuronal characterization and classification. We implemented the toolbox on a diverse set of neural recordings and demonstrated its functionality, efficiency, and versatility in capturing features that can well-distinguish neuronal subgroups across brain regions and species. ElecFeX is thus presented as a powerful tool to significantly promote future studies on neuronal electrical activity.",

    "abstract": "During the expansion of a cell collective, such as the development of microbial colonies and tumor progression, the local cell growth increases the local pressure, which in turn suppresses cell growth. How this pressure-growth coupling affects the expansion of a cell collective remains unclear. Here, we answer this question using a continuum model of cell collective. We find that a fast-growing leading front and a slow-growing interior of the cell collective emerge due to the pressure-dependent growth rate. The leading front can exhibit fingering instability and we confirm the predicted instability criteria numerically with the leading front explicitly simulated. Intriguingly, we find that fingering instability is not only a consequence of local cell growth but also enhances the entire populations growth rate as positive feedback. Our work unveils the fitness advantage of fingering formation quantitatively and suggests that the ability to form protrusion can be evolutionarily selected.",

    "abstract": "The neural basis of fear of heights remains essentially unknown. We observed mice displaying stereotyped aversive behaviors when encountered height threats, resembling human height vertigo. Visual input plays a crucial role in mouse reactions to heights, which can also be influenced by vestibular input and prior height experiences. Unexpectedly, fear of heights in inexperienced mice does not rely on image-forming visual processing by the primary visual cortex. Instead, a subset of neurons in the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN) connecting to the lateral/ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (l/vlPAG) drives the expression of height-related fear. Additionally, a subcortical visual pathway linking the superior colliculus to the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus inhibits the defensive response to height threats. These findings highlight an unconscious fear response to height threats through a rapid subcortical visual and defensive pathway from vLGN to l/vlPAG.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryA non-image visual mechanism of fear of heights",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SZ) is a neuropsychiatric disorder that affects millions globally. Current diagnosis of SZ is symptom-based, which poses difficulty due to the variability of symptoms across patients. To this end, many recent studies have developed deep learning methods for automated diagnosis of SZ, especially using raw EEG, which provides high temporal precision. For such methods to be productionized, they must be both explainable and robust. Explainable models are essential to identify biomarkers of SZ, and robust models are critical to learn generalizable patterns, especially amidst changes in the implementation environment. One common example is channel loss during recording, which could be detrimental to EEG classifier performance. In this study, we develop a novel channel dropout (CD) approach to increase the robustness of explainable deep learning models trained on EEG data for SZ diagnosis to channel loss. We develop a baseline convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and implement our approach in the form of a CD layer added to the baseline architecture (CNN-CD). We then apply two explainability approaches for insight into the spatial and spectral features learned by the CNN models and show that the application of CD decreases model sensitivity to channel loss. Results further show that our models heavily prioritize the parietal electrodes and the -band, which is supported by existing literature. It is our hope that this study motivates the further development of models that are both explainable and robust and bridges the transition from research to application in a clinical decision support role.",

    "abstract": "Activation of oncogenes through DNA amplification/overexpression plays an important role in cancer initiation and progression. Chromosome 17 has many cancer-associated genetic anomalies. This cytogenetic anomaly is strongly associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer. FOXK2 gene is located on 17q25 and encodes a transcriptional factor with a forkhead DNA binding domain. By integrative analysis of public genomic datasets of breast cancers, we found that FOXK2 is frequently amplified and overexpressed in breast cancers. FOXK2 overexpression in breast cancer patients is associated with poor overall survival. FOXK2 knockdown significantly inhibits cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis, and anchorage-independent growth, as well as causes G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in breast cancer cells. Moreover, inhibition of FOXK2 expression sensitizes breast cancer cells to frontline anti-tumor chemotherapies. More importantly, co-overexpression of FOXK2 and PI3KCA with oncogenic mutations (E545K or H1047R) induces cellular transformation in non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells, suggesting that FOXK2 is an oncogene in breast cancer and is involved in PI3KCA-driven tumorigenesis. Our study identified CCNE2, PDK1, and Estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) as direct transcriptional targets of FOXK2 in MCF-7 cells. Blocking CCNE2- and PDK1-mediated signaling by using small molecule inhibitors has synergistic anti-tumor effects in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, FOXK2 inhibition by gene knockdown or inhibitors for its transcriptional targets (CCNE2 and PDK1) in combination with PI3KCA inhibitor, Alpelisib, showed synergistic anti-tumor effects on breast cancer cells with PI3KCA oncogenic mutations. In summary, we provide compelling evidence that FOXK2 plays an oncogenic role in breast tumorigenesis and targeting FOXK2-mediated pathways may be a potential therapeutic strategy in breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Carbon monoxide (CO) has emerged as a potential neuroprotective agent that could underlie the reduced risk of Parkinsons disease (PD) among smokers. Here, we evaluated the neuroprotective potential of low-dose CO treatment in PD models. In an AAV-alpha-synuclein (aSyn) model, rats underwent right nigral injection of AAV1/2-aSynA53T and left injection of empty AAV and were treated with oral CO drug product (HBI-002 10ml/kg, daily by gavage) or vehicle. In a short-term MPTP model (40mg/kg, i.p.), mice were treated with inhaled CO (iCO) (250ppm) or air. HPLC measurement of striatal dopamine, immunohistochemistry, stereological cell counting, and biochemical analyses were conducted blinded to treatment condition. Administration of HBI-002 in the aSyn model reduced ipsilateral loss of both striatal dopamine and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in the substantia nigra and reduced aSyn aggregates and S129 phosphorylation. In MPTP-exposed mice, low-dose iCO reduced loss of dopamine and TH+ neurons. In saline-treated mice, iCO had no effect on striatal dopamine levels or TH+ cell counts. CO has been shown to activate PD-relevant cytoprotective cascades. Indeed, HBI-002 increased both heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and HIF-1alpha. HBI-002 also increased Cathepsin D and Polo-like kinase 2, proteins that contribute to aSyn degradation. In human brain samples, HO-1 decorated Lewy bodies (LB), but HO-1 expression was greater in neurons without LB than neurons with LB pathology. These results demonstrating reduced dopamine cell death and aSyn pathology and engagement of PD-relevant molecular cascades advance low-dose CO as a potential neuroprotective strategy for PD.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide, alcohol use and abuse are a leading risk of mortality, causing 5.3% of all deaths (W.H.O., 2022). The endocrine stress system, initiated by the peripheral release of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) from primarily glutamatergic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), is profoundly linked with alcohol use, abuse, and relapse (Blaine & Sinha, 2017). These PVN CRH-releasing (PVNCRH) neurons are essential for peripheral and central stress responses (Rasiah et al., 2023), but little is known about how alcohol affects these neurons. Here, we show that two- bottle choice alcohol consumption blunts the endocrine mediated corticosterone response to stress during acute withdrawal in female mice. Conversely, using slice electrophysiology, we demonstrate that acute withdrawal engenders a hyperexcitable phenotype of PVNCRH neurons in females that is accompanied by increased glutamatergic transmission in both male and female mice. Only male mice show a concurrent increase in GABAergic synaptic transmission. We then tested whether chemogenetic inhibition of PVNCRH neurons would restore stress response in female mice with a history of alcohol drinking in the looming disc test, which mimics an approaching predator threat. Accordingly, inhibition of PVNCRH neurons reduced active escape in hM4Di alcohol history mice only. This study indicates that stress responsive PVNCRH neurons in females are particularly affected by a history of alcohol consumption. Interestingly, women have indicated an increase in heavy alcohol use to cope with stress (Rodriguez et al., 2020), perhaps pointing to a potential underlying mechanism in alcohol mediated changes to PVNCRH neurons that alter stress response.",

    "abstract": "The long-term consequences of cancer or cancer therapy on the patients immune system years after cancer-free survival remain poorly understood. Here, we have performed an in-depth characterization of the bone marrow ecosystem of multiple myeloma long-term survivors at initial diagnosis and up to 17 years following cancer-free survival. Using comparative single-cell analyses in combination with molecular, genomic and functional approaches, we demonstrate that multiple myeloma long-term survivors display pronounced alterations in their bone marrow microenvironment associated with impaired immunity. These immunological alterations were frequently driven by an inflammatory immune circuit fueled by the long-term persistence or resurgence of residual myeloma cells. Notably, even in the complete absence of any detectable residual disease for decades, sustained changes in the immune system were observed, suggesting an irreversible  immunological scarring caused by the initial exposure to the cancer and therapy. Collectively, our study provides key insights into the molecular and cellular bone marrow ecosystem of multiple myeloma long-term survivors, revealing reversible and irreversible alterations of the immune compartment, which can serve as diagnostic and predictive tools.\n\nStatement of significanceLarge-scale single-cell profiling of a unique cohort of multiple myeloma long-term survivors uncovered that exposure to cancer and its treatment causes both reversible and irreversible immune alterations associated with impaired immunity. These findings have far-reaching implications for the understanding of long-term immune alterations in cancer, which need to be considered also in the context of immune therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, our study demonstrates how cancer-associated immune trafficking can be used to predict disease re-initiation in the bone marrow, opening new avenues for minimally invasive disease monitoring.",

This disease is characterized by pronounced alveolar hypoventilation and diminished chemoreflexes, particularly to abnormally high levels of arterial pCO2. Mutations in the transcription factors PHOX2B and LBX1 have been identified in CCHS patients, but the dysfunctional circuit responsible for this disease remains unknown. Here, we show that distinct sets of medullary neurons co-expressing both transcription factors (dB2 neurons) account for specific respiratory functions and phenotypes seen in CCHS. By combining murine intersectional chemogenetics, intersectional labeling, and the selective targeting of the CCHS disease-causing Lbx1FS mutation to specific subgroups of dB2 neurons, we uncovered novel sets of these cells key for i) respiratory tidal volumes and the hypercarbic reflex, ii) neonatal respiratory stability and iii) neonatal survival. These data provide functional evidence for the essential role of dB2 neurons in neonatal respiratory physiology and will be instrumental for the development of therapeutic strategies for the management of CCHS.

    "abstract": "The control of gene expression is a fundamental process essential for correct development and to maintain homeostasis. Many post-transcriptional mechanisms exist to maintain the correct levels of each RNA transcript within the cell. Controlled and targeted cytoplasmic RNA degradation is one such mechanism with the 5-3 exoribonuclease Pacman (XRN1) and the 3-5 exoribonuclease Dis3L2 playing crucial roles. Loss of function mutations in either Pacman or Dis3L2 have been demonstrated to result in distinct phenotypes, and both have been implicated in human disease. One mechanism by which gene expression is controlled is through the function of miRNAs which have been shown to be crucial for the control of almost all cellular processes. Although the biogenesis and mechanisms of action of miRNAs have been comprehensively studied, the mechanisms regulating their own turnover are not well understood. Here we characterise the miRNA landscape in a natural developing tissue, the Drosophila melanogaster wing imaginal disc, and assess the importance of Pacman and Dis3L2 on the abundance of miRNAs. We reveal a complex landscape of miRNA expression and show that whilst a null mutation in dis3L2 has a minimal effect on the miRNA expression profile, loss of Pacman has a profound effect with a third of all detected miRNAs demonstrating Pacman-sensitivity. We also reveal a role of Pacman in regulating the highly conserved let-7 cluster (containing miR-100, let-7 and miR-125) and present a genetic model outlining a positive feedback loop regulated by Pacman which begins to explain the apoptotic phenotype observed in Pacman mutants.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPhosphodiesterases (PDEs) are the enzymes that hydrolyze cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP) playing a key role in the homeostasis of these two second messengers. PDE2A is a dual-specific PDE that breaks down both cAMP and cGMP and can be activated by cGMP. It appears peculiar that the Pde2A-deficient (Pde2A-/-) mouse model is embryonically lethal, likely due to a strongly reduced size of liver and to a severe anemia. In addition, the heart of Pde2A-/- embryos shows ventricular and atrial septum defects, hypertrabeculation, heart dilatation and non-compaction defects. We recently highlighted a direct relationship between Pde2A impairment, consequent increase of cAMP and the onset of mouse congenital heart defects (CHDs), however the molecular mechanisms underlining the heart defects remain unknown.\n\nMethodsTranscriptome analysis of Pde2A-/- embryonic heart was performed by RNA sequencing and the most altered genes were also analyzed by quantitative real time PCR. In vivo treatment with drugs acting on cAMP signaling (Metoprolol and H89) and oxidative stress (N-Acetyl-Cysteine, NAC) were carried out on pregnant Pde2A+/- female. Histological, biochemical, and molecular analyses were then performed on embryonic hearts.\n\nResultsWe found a significant modulation of more than 500 genes affecting biological processes involved in the immune system, cardiomyocyte development and contractility, angiogenesis, control of gene transcription and oxidative stress in hearts from Pde2A-/- embryos. Metoprolol and H89 administration were able to prevent heart dilatation and hypertabeculation in Pde2A-/-embryos. Metoprolol was also able to partially impede heart septum defect and oxidative stress at tissue and molecular levels.

    "abstract": "The success of a predatory attack is related to how much a predator manages to approach a prey without being detected. Some carnivore mammals use environmental objects as visual obstacles during stalking behaviour, allowing them to get closer to their prey while only showing parts of their coat or faces during movement or visual monitoring. Here, we investigate the influence of carnivores body postures and gaze on their detection by potential prey. To do so, we photographed taxidermized carnivore models (cougar, ocelot and lesser grison) in natural scenes and presented them to human dichromats (i.e., colourblind) and trichromats (i.e., normal colour vision). Our findings highlight the importance of predators complete body outline and gaze as search images during predator detection tasks. We also demonstrate how the coat and facial colour pattern of predators may camouflage their body outline and gaze, hampering predator detection. Furthermore, we observed that carnivore coat colour patterns may serve as an additional cue for trichromats, particularly in hidden carnivore detection tasks that proved to be more difficult for dichromats. We discuss our results within the context of a predator-prey arms race scenario, considering the evolutionary processes that may have generated the evidence presented in this study.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying behavior and relating it to underlying biological states is of paramount importance in many life science fields. Although barriers to recording postural data have been reduced by progress in deep-learning-based computer vision tools for keypoint tracking, extracting specific behaviors from this data remains challenging. Manual behavior coding, the present gold standard, is labor-intensive and subject to intra-and inter-observer variability. Automatic methods are stymied by the difficulty of explicitly defining complex behaviors, even ones which appear obvious to the human eye. Here, we demonstrate an effective technique for detecting one such behavior, a form of locomotion characterized by stereotyped spinning, termed circling. Though circling has an extensive history as a behavioral marker, at present there exists no standard automated detection method. Accordingly, we developed a technique to identify instances of the behavior by applying simple postprocessing to markerless keypoint data from videos of freely-exploring (Cib2-/-;Cib3-/-) mutant mice, a strain we previously found to exhibit circling. Our technique agrees with human consensus at the same level as do individual observers, and it achieves >90% accuracy in discriminating videos of wild type mice from videos of mutants. As using this technique requires no experience writing or modifying code, it also provides a convenient, noninvasive, quantitative tool for analyzing circling mouse models. Additionally, as our approach was agnostic to the underlying behavior, these results support the feasibility of algorithmically detecting specific, research-relevant behaviors using readily-interpretable parameters tuned on the basis of human consensus.",

This study investigated the hypothesis that successive triads of ex-Gaussian mu, sigma, and tau parameters of reaction-time variability across time can be used to construct a geometrical object we termed ex-Gaussian RT-signature, which could help characterize interindividual differences between congruent and incongruent stimuli. To test this hypothesis, we calculated the similarity index of these geometrical objects in young adult participants without detectable neurological disorders. Our findings show that each participant displayed distinct ex-Gaussian RT-signatures in a Cartesian 3D plot, thus exhibiting distinct psychophysical fingerprints. Furthermore, our results revealed that the ex-Gaussian RT-signatures for incongruent stimuli demonstrated a significantly higher similarity index across participants than congruent stimuli (p<0.001; Cohen d=0.4). We suggest that visualizing this psychophysical signature could serve as a valuable tool in characterizing differences in cognitive functioning between individuals, thus providing insights into the development of personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "Disruptions to sleep can be debilitating and have a severe effect on daily life. Patients with the sleep disorder narcolepsy suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness, disrupted nighttime sleep, and cataplexy - the abrupt loss of postural muscle tone (atonia) during wakefulness, often triggered by strong emotion. The dopamine (DA) system is implicated in both sleep-wake states and cataplexy, but little is known about the function of DA release in the striatum - a major output region of midbrain DA neurons - and sleep disorders. To better characterize the function and pattern of DA release in sleepiness and cataplexy, we combined optogenetics, fiber photometry, and sleep recordings in a murine model of narcolepsy (orexin-/-; OX KO) and in wildtype mice. Recording DA release in the ventral striatum revealed OX-independent changes across sleep-wake states as well as striking increases in DA release in the ventral, but not dorsal, striatum prior to cataplexy onset. Tonic low frequency stimulation of ventral tegmental efferents in the ventral striatum suppressed both cataplexy and REM sleep, while phasic high frequency stimulation increased cataplexy propensity and decreased the latency to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Together, our findings demonstrate a functional role of DA release in the striatum in regulating cataplexy and REM sleep.",

    "abstract": "The early embryonic development of the pig comprises a long in utero pre- and peri-implantation development, which dramatically differs from mouse and human. During this pro-tracted peri-implantation period, an intimate dialogue between the embryo and the uterus is established through a complex series of paracrine signals. It leads to concomitant drastic changes in the embryonic morphology and uterine receptivity to implantation. From day 7 after fertilization, the spherical blastocyst elongates as ovoid, tubular and filamentous wich transforms from a 0.5-1 mm diameter sphere to a 1000 mm long filamentous blastocyst at day 16. At the same time, the inner cell mass moves up to the trophoblast as the Raubers layer disappears and evolves as an embryonic disc that is directly exposed to molecules present in the uterine fluids. These drastic changes occurring before implantation are driven and coordinated by interactions between embryonic cells and maternal tissues.\n\nTo better understand the biology of pig embryos before implantation, we generated a large dataset of single-cell RNAseq at different embryonic stages (early and hatched blastocyst, spheroid and ovoid conceptus) and proteomic datasets from corresponding uterine fluids. These data were cleaned, filtered and represent a total of 34,888 cells. We first characterised the embryonic and extra-embryonic cell populations and their evolution, and identified population-specific markers of the three main populations (epiblast, trophectoderm and hypoblast). Our analysis also confirmed known functions and predicted new biological functions associated with these cell populations.We then inferred gene regulatory networks working on modules of gene regulation (regulon) and selected those that were specifically active in each embryonic population. We confirmed the relevance of the identified regulons by a meta-analysis of two other scRNAseq datasets (porcine and human preimplantation embryos). We then linked these regulons to signalling pathways and biological processes. Our results confirm the molecular specificity and functionality of the three main cell populations and identify novel stage-specific subpopulations. In particular, we discovered two previously unknown subpopulations of the trophectoderm, one characterised by the expression of LRP2, which could represent a subpopulation of progenitor cells, and the other, expressing many pro-apoptotic markers, which could correspond to the cells of the Raubers layer. We also provide new insights into the biology of these populations, their reciprocal functional interactions and the molecular dialogue established with the maternal uterine environment.",

    "abstract": "Conditions for self-organisation via Turings mechanism in biological systems represented by reaction-diffusion or reaction-cross-diffusion models have been extensively studied. Nonetheless, the impact of tissue stratification in such systems is under-explored, despite its ubiquity in the context of a thin epithelium overlying connective tissue, for instance the epidermis and underlying dermal mesenchyme of embryonic skin. In particular, each layer can be subject to extensively different biochemical reactions and transport processes, with chemotaxis - a special case of cross-diffusion - often present in the mesenchyme, contrasting the solely molecular transport typically found in the epidermal layer. We study Turing patterning conditions for a class of reaction-cross-diffusion systems in bilayered regions, with a thin upper layer and coupled by a linear transport law. In particular, the role of differential transport through the interface is explored together with the presence of asymmetry between the homogeneous equilibria of the two layers. A linear stability analysis is carried out around a spatially homogeneous equilibrium state in the asymptotic limit of weak and strong coupling strengths, where quantitative approximations of the bifurcation curve can be computed. Our theoretical findings, for an arbitrary number of reacting species, reveal quantitative Turing conditions, highlighting when the coupling mechanism between the layered regions can either trigger patterning or stabilize a homogeneous equilibrium regardless of the independent patterning state of each layer. We support our theoretical results through direct numerical simulations, and provide an open source code to explore such systems further.",

    "abstract": "All living things are profoundly affected by temperature. In spite of the thermodynamic constraints on biology, some animals have evolved to live and move in extremely cold environments. Here, we investigate behavioral mechanisms of cold tolerance in the snow fly (Chionea spp.), a flightless crane fly that is active throughout the winter in boreal and alpine environments of the northern hemisphere. Using thermal imaging, we show that adult snow flies maintain the ability to walk down to an average body temperature of -7 {degrees}C. At this supercooling limit, ice crystallization occurs within the snow flys hemolymph and rapidly spreads throughout the body, resulting in death. However, we discovered that snow flies frequently survive freezing by rapidly amputating legs before ice crystallization can spread to their vital organs. Self-amputation of freezing limbs is a last-ditch tactic to prolong survival in frigid conditions that few animals can endure. Understanding the extreme physiology and behavior of snow insects is urgently important, as the alpine ecosystems they inhabit are being disproportionately altered by anthropogenic climate change.",

Complexin (Cpx) controls spontaneous and evoked neurotransmitter release by modulating SNARE complex zippering. Although the central SNARE-binding helix is essential, post-translational modifications to Cpxs C-terminal membrane-binding amphipathic helix modulate its activity. Here we demonstrate that RNA editing of the Cpx C-terminus regulates its ability to clamp SNARE-mediated fusion and alters presynaptic output. RNA editing of Cpx within single neurons is stochastic, generating up to eight edit variants that fine-tune neurotransmitter release by changing the subcellular localization and clamping properties of the protein. Similar editing rules for other synaptic genes were observed, indicating stochastic editing at single adenosines and across multiple mRNAs can generate unique synaptic proteomes within the same population of neurons to fine-tune presynaptic output.",

    "abstract": "Emerging concepts of developmental vascular remodelling recently identified that selectively labelled sprouting tip cells and/or venous endothelial cells (ECs) accumulate in developing arteries, suggesting directional migration of specific ECs drives artery formation. However, a general population analysis and detailed quantitative investigation of migratory mechanisms is so far lacking. Here, we developed a universally applicable quantitative approach and a computational model allowing to track and simulate stochastically labelled EC populations irrespective of labelling density and origin. Dynamic mapping of EC distributions in a bespoke coordinate system revealed how ECs move during the most active remodelling phases in the mouse retina. Simulation and parameter sensitivity analysis illustrated that the population shift from veins to arteries cannot be explained by random walk, but best fits to a tuneable dual force-field between shear-force induced directionality against blood flow, and hypoxia mediated VEGFA-gradients. High migration rates require only weak flow-migration coupling, whereas low migration rates require strong coupling to the flow direction. Functional analysis identified Cdc42 as the critical mediator of overall population movement from veins to arteries, yet with surprising heterogeneity suggesting the existence of distinct cell populations. This new quantitative understanding will enable future tailored intervention and tuning of the remodelling process.",

Compared to other apes, humans have a relatively larger lateral nucleus of the amygdala, which is consistent with both the self-domestication and the cooperative breeding hypothesis of human evolution.\n\nMethodsHere, we take a comparative approach to the evolutionary origin of the relatively larger lateral amygdala nucleus in humans. We carry out phylogenetic analysis on a sample of 17 mammalian species for which we acquired single amygdala nuclei volumetric data.\n\nResultsOur results indicate that there has been convergent evolution toward larger lateral amygdala nuclei in both domesticated and cooperatively breeding mammals.\n\nConclusionThese results suggest that changes in processing fearful stimuli to reduce fear-induced aggression, which are necessary for domesticated and cooperatively breeding species alike, tap into the same neurobiological proximate mechanism. However, humans show not only changes in processing fearful stimuli but also in prosociality. Since cooperative breeding, but not domestication, is also associated with prosociality, a prominent role of the former during human evolution is more parsimonious, whereas self-domestication may have been involved as an additional stepping stone.",

    "abstract": "Vascularization plays a critical role in organ maturation and cell type development. Drug discovery, organ mimicry, and ultimately transplantation in a clinical setting thereby hinges on achieving robust vascularization of in vitro engineered organs. Here, focusing on human kidney organoids, we overcome this hurdle by combining an inducible ETS translocation variant 2 (ETV2) human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line, which directs endothelial fate, with a non-transgenic iPSC line in suspension organoid culture. The resulting human kidney organoids show extensive vascularization by endothelial cells with an identity most closely related to endogenous kidney endothelia. Vascularized organoids also show increased maturation of nephron structures including more mature podocytes with improved marker expression, foot process interdigitation, an associated fenestrated endothelium, and the presence of renin+ cells. The creation of an engineered vascular niche capable of improving kidney organoid maturation and cell type complexity is a significant step forward in the path to clinical translation. Furthermore, this approach is orthogonal to native tissue differentiation paths, hence readily adaptable to other organoid systems and thus has the potential for a broad impact on basic and translational organoid studies.\n\nTranslational StatementDeveloping therapies for patients with kidney diseases relies on a morphologically and physiologically representative in vitro model. Human kidney organoids are an attractive model to recapitulate kidney physiology, however, they are limited by the absence of a vascular network and mature cell populations. In this work, we have generated a genetically inducible endothelial niche that, when combined with an established kidney organoid protocol, induces the maturation of a robust endothelial cell network, induces a more mature podocyte population, and induces the emergence a functional renin population. This advance significantly increases the clinical relevance of human kidney organoids for etiological studies of kidney disease and future regenerative medicine strategies.\n\nGraphical AbstractGenetically engineered endothelial niche induces mature cell populations in human kidney organoids\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/542848v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b129d4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@313ae3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@111c91org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16a8d45_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "A-to-I RNA editing is an important cellular process that modifies genomically encoded information during transcription, to generate various RNA isoforms from a single DNA sequence. It involves the conversion of specific adenosines in the RNA sequence to inosines by ADAR proteins, resulting in their recognition as guanosines by cellular machinery, and as such plays a vital role in neuronal and immune functions. Given the widespread occurrence of A-to-I RNA editing events across the animal kingdom, with thousands to millions of editing sites found in the transcriptomes of organisms such as flies and humans, identifying the critical sites and understanding their in-vivo functions remains a challenging task. Here we show for the first time the physiological importance of a single editing site, found within the extracellular domain of the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl), and bridge the gap between its evolutionary conservation across Drosophila species and its function in shaping the behavior of adult flies. We used genomic editing to ablate editing at this specific site, such that the endogenous channel harbors only the unedited version and used a battery of behavioral paradigms to analyze the effects on various features of adult behavior. We provide evidence that GluClunedited flies exhibit reduced olfactory responses to both appetitive and aversive odors, as well as impaired pheromone-dependent social interactions, and that editing of this site is required for proper processing of olfactory information in olfactory projection neurons. Our findings demonstrate that evolutionary conservation is a useful criterion to pinpoint which of the many editing events has the potential of having a function and pave the path for dissecting the link between RNA modification, neuronal physiology, and behavior.",

    "abstract": "The subiculum, a key output region of the hippocampus, is increasingly recognized as playing a crucial role in seizure initiation and spread. The subiculum consists of glutamatergic pyramidal cells, which show alterations in intrinsic excitability in the course of epilepsy, and multiple types of GABAergic interneurons, which exhibit varying characteristics in epilepsy. In this study, we aimed to assess the role of the vasoactive intestinal peptide interneurons (VIP-INs) of the ventral subiculum in the pathophysiology of temporal lobe epilepsy. We observed that an anatomically restricted inhibition of VIP-INs of the ventral subiculum was sufficient to reduce seizures in the intrahippocampal kainic acid model of epilepsy, changing the circadian rhythm of seizures, emphasizing the critical role of this small cell population in modulating TLE. As we expected, permanent unilateral or bilateral silencing of VIP-INs of the ventral subiculum in non-epileptic animals did not induce seizures or epileptiform activity. Interestingly, transient activation of VIP-INs of the ventral subiculum was enough to increase the frequency of seizures in the acute seizure model. Our results offer new perspectives on the crucial involvement of VIP-INs of the ventral subiculum in the pathophysiology of TLE. Given the observed predominant disinhibitory role of the VIP-INs input in subicular microcircuits, modifications of this input could be considered in the development of therapeutic strategies to improve seizure control.",

    "abstract": "Glycyl tRNA aminoacylation is catalyzed by two different enzymes in different lineages of the Tree of Life. We have investigated the complex evolutionary history of one of these enzymes, the bacterial glycyl tRNA synthetase (bacGlyRS). Component domains of bacGlyRS show common ancestry with 1) the catalytic domain of class II tRNA synthetases; 2) the HD domain of the bacterial RNase Y; 3) the body and tail domains of the archaeal CCA-adding enzyme; 4) the anti-codon binding domain of the arginyl tRNA synthetase; and 5) a previously unrecognized domain that we call ATL (Ancient tRNA latch). The emergence of bacGlyRS in its extant form would have required the recruitment of domains from a pool of existing homologs, possibly at different times, by a process of molecular bricolage. A domain-by-domain analysis reveals that the catalytic and ATL domains in bacGlyRS are more closely related to domains in the universal alanyl tRNA synthetase (uniAlaRS) than to any other aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. The data suggest that bacGlyRS was present at the last bacterial common ancestor. Similarities between component domains of bacGlyRS and archaeal homologs, including the archaeal CCA-adding enzyme, suggest a complex evolutionary history. Here we explore a scenario in which bacGlyRS and uniAlaRS emerged from a shared core before the last universal common ancestor by a stepwise accumulation of protein domains during the dawn of biology.",

We hypothesise that these variants may regulate expression in specific biological contexts, such as stimulated immune cells. Here, we used human iPSC-derived macrophages to map eQTLs across 24 cellular conditions. We found that 76% of eQTLs detected in at least one stimulated condition were also found in naive cells. The percentage of response eQTLs (reQTLs) varied widely across conditions (3.7% - 28.4%), with reQTLs specific to a single condition being rare (1.11%). Despite their relative rarity, reQTLs were overrepresented among disease-colocalizing eQTLs. We nominated an additional 21.7% of disease effector genes at GWAS loci via colocalization of reQTLs, with 38.6% of these not found in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) catalogue.

    "abstract": "Investigating the evolution of structural features in modern multidomain proteins helps to understand their immense diversity and functional versatility. The class of periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) offers an opportunity to interrogate one of the main processes driving diversification: the duplication and fusion of protein sequences to generate new architectures. The symmetry of their two-lobed topology, their mechanism of binding, and the organization of their operon structure led to the hypothesis that PBPs arose through a duplication and fusion event of a single common ancestor. To investigate this claim, we set out to reverse the evolutionary process and recreate the structural equivalent of a single-lobed progenitor using ribose-binding protein (RBP) as our model. We found that this modern PBP can be deconstructed into its lobes, producing two proteins that represent possible progenitor halves. The isolated halves of RBP are well folded and monomeric proteins, albeit with a lower thermostability, and do not retain the original binding function. However, the two entities readily form a heterodimer in vitro and in-cell. The X-ray structure of the heterodimer closely resembles the parental protein. Moreover, the binding function is fully regained upon formation of the heterodimer with a ligand affinity similar to that observed in the modern RBP. This highlights how a duplication event could have given rise to a stable and functional PBP-like fold and provides insights into how more complex functional structures can evolve from simpler molecular components.",

Comparison with other bacterial CEs reveals that the extended loop is not conserved. However, the hydrogen bonding functionality to CGA is preserved thanks to other residues. Structural comparison with ferulic acid esterases (FAEs), a related enzyme class, shows that CEs feature a more restricted active site, reflecting the fact that they hydrolyze smaller substrates compared to FAEs.",

    "abstract": "The recently discovered interaction between Presenilin 1 (PS1), a catalytic subunit of {gamma}-secretase responsible for generating amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) peptides, and GLT-1, a major glutamate transporter in the brain (EAAT2) provides a mechanistic link between these two key factors involved in Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology. Modulating this interaction can be crucial to understand the consequence of such crosstalk in AD context and beyond. However, the interaction sites between these two proteins are unknown. Herein, we utilized an alanine scanning approach coupled with FRET-based fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to identify the interaction sites between PS1 and GLT-1 in their native environment within intact cells. We found that GLT-1 residues at position 276 to 279 (TM5) and PS1 residues at position 249 to 252 (TM6) are crucial for GLT-1/PS1 interaction. These results have been cross validated using AlphaFold Multimer prediction. To further investigate whether this interaction of endogenously expressed GLT-1 and PS1 can be prevented in primary neurons, we designed PS1/GLT-1 cell-permeable peptides (CPPs) targeting the PS1 or GLT-1 binding site. We used HIV TAT domain to allow for cell penetration which was assayed in neurons. First, we assessed the toxicity and penetration of CPPs by confocal microscopy. Next, to ensure the efficiency of CPPs, we monitored the modulation of GLT-1/PS1 interaction in intact neurons by FLIM. We saw significantly less interaction between PS1 and GLT-1 with both CPPs. Our study establishes a new tool to study the functional aspect of GLT-1/PS1 interaction and its relevance in normal physiology and AD models.",

The redox sensing mechanism in -proteobacterial NifA is poorly understood. In this work, we examine if a Cys pair that is part of a C(X)5C motif and located immediately upstream of NifAs DNA binding domain is involved in redox sensing in NifA from the -proteobacterium Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus (Gd). We hypothesize that the Cys residues redox state may directly influence the DNA binding domains DNA binding affinity and/or alter the proteins oligomeric sate. Two DNA binding domain constructs were generated, a longer construct (2C-DBD), consisting of the DNA binding domain with the upstream Cys pair, and a shorter construct (NC-DBD) that lacks the Cys pair. The Kd of NC-DBD for its cognate DNA sequence (nifH-UAS) is equal to 20.0 M. The Kd of 2C-DBD for nifH-UAS when the Cys pair is oxidized is 34.5 M. Reduction of the disulfide bond does not change the DNA binding affinity. Additional experiments indicate that the redox state of the Cys residues does not influence the secondary structure or oligomerization state of the NifA DNA binding domain. Together, these results demonstrate that the Cys pair upstream of the DNA binding domain of Gd-NifA does not regulate DNA binding or domain dimerization in a redox dependent manner. This suggests that other Cys residues in NifA, such as those located in the central AAA+ domain, are responsible for redox sensing.",

Previous work using SweetTrac1, a biosensor constructed by the intramolecular fusion of a conformation-sensitive fluorescent protein in the plasma membrane transporter SWEET1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, identified common features in the transporters substrates. Here, we report SweetTrac2, a new biosensor based on the Arabidopsis vacuole membrane transporter SWEET2 and use it to explore the substrate specificity of this second protein. Our results show that SWEET1 and SWEET2 recognize similar substrates but some with different affinities. Sequence comparison and mutagenesis analysis support the conclusion that the differences in affinity depend on non-specific interactions involving key residues in the binding pocket.

Since most AAV serotypes used in gene therapy infect cells via interaction with AAVR, the quantification of the vector-binding ability of AAV to AAVR could be an important quality check for therapeutic AAV vectors. To enable a steady evaluation of the AAV-AAVR interaction, we created an engineered AAVR through mutagenesis. Engineered AAVR showed high durability against acid while retaining its AAV-binding activity and an affinity chromatography column with engineered AAVR was also developed. This column enabled repeated binding and acid dissociation measurements of AAVR with various AAV serotypes. Our data showed that the binding affinities of AAV to AAVR were diverse among serotypes, providing insight into the relationship with the infection efficiency of AAV vectors. Thus, this affinity column can be used in process development for quality checks, quantitating capsid titers, and affinity purification of AAV vectors.

    "abstract": "The increasing number of publicly available bacterial gene expression data sets provides an unprecedented resource for the study of gene regulation in diverse conditions, but emphasizes the need for self-supervised methods for the automated generation of new hypotheses. One approach for inferring coordinated regulation from bacterial expression data is through the use of neural networks known as denoising autoencoders (DAEs), which encode large datasets in a reduced bottleneck layer. We have generalized this application of DAEs to include deep networks and explore the effects of network architecture on gene set inference using deep learning. We developed a DAE-based pipeline to extract gene sets from a large compendium of transcriptomic data in Escherichia coli, independently of the DAE network parameters and architecture. We validate our method by identifying many of the inferred gene sets with known pathways in E. coli, and have subsequently used this pipeline to explore how the choice of network architecture impacts gene sets recovery. We find that increasing network depth leads the DAEs to explain gene expression in terms of fewer, more concisely defined gene sets, and that adjusting the network compression results in a trade-off between generalizability and overall biological inference. Finally, leveraging our understanding of the impact of DAE architecture choices on gene set inference, we apply our pipeline to an independent uropathogenic E. coli dataset collected directly from infected patients to identify genes which are uniquely induced during human colonization.",

    "abstract": "Inferring gene expressions from histopathological images has always been a fascinating but challenging task due to the huge differences between the two modal data. Previous works have used modified DenseNet121 to encode the local images and make gene expression predictions. And later works improved the prediction accuracy of gene expression by incorporating the coordinate information from images and using all spots in the tissue region as input. While these methods were limited in use due to model complexity, large demand on GPU memory, and insufficient encoding of local images, thus the results had low interpretability, relatively low accuracy, and over-smooth prediction of gene expression among neighbor spots. In this paper, we propose TCGN, (Transformer with Convolution and Graph-Node co-embedding method) for gene expression prediction from H&E stained pathological slide images. TCGN consists of convolutional layers, transformer encoders, and graph neural networks, and is the first to integrate these blocks in a general and interpretable computer vision backbone for histopathological image analysis. We trained TCGN and compared its performance with three existing methods on a publicly available spatial transcriptomic dataset. Even in the absence of the coordinates information and neighbor spots, TCGN still outperformed the existing methods by 5% and achieved 10 times higher prediction accuracy than the counterpart model. Besides its higher accuracy, our model is also small enough to be run on a personal computer and does not need complex building graph preprocessing compared to the existing methods. Moreover, TCGN is interpretable in recognizing special cell morphology and cell-cell interactions compared to models using all spots as input that are not interpretable. A more accurate omics information prediction from pathological images not only links genotypes to phenotypes so that we can predict more biomarkers that are expensive to test from histopathological images that are low-cost to obtain, but also provides a theoretical basis for future modeling of multi-modal data. Our results support that TCGN is a useful tool for inferring gene expressions from histopathological images and other potential histopathological image analysis studies.\n\nHighlightsO_LIFirst deep learning model to integrate CNN, GNN, and transformer for image analysis\nC_LIO_LIAn interpretable model that uses cell morphology and organizations to predict genes\nC_LIO_LIHigher gene expression prediction accuracy without global information\nC_LIO_LIAccurately predicted genes are related to immune escape and abnormal metabolism\nC_LIO_LIPredict important biomarkers for breast cancer accurately from cheaper images\nC_LI\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=123 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/542669v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c6a4dforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7266d4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bcfd0aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@188d452_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We developed covalent protein painting (CPP), a protein footprinting method that quantitatively labels exposed lysine, and have now extended the method to whole intact animals to measure surface accessibility as a surrogate of in vivo protein conformations. We investigated how protein structure and protein expression change as Alzheimers disease (AD) progresses by conducting in vivo whole animal labeling of AD mice. This allowed us to analyze broadly protein accessibility in various organs over the course of AD. We observed that structural changes of proteins related to  energy generation,  carbon metabolism, and  metal ion homeostasis preceded expression changes in the brain.

    "abstract": "Populational brain imaging methods based on group averages provide valuable insights into the general functions of the brain. However, they often overlook the inherent inter- and intra-subject variability, limiting our understanding of individual differences. To address this limitation, researchers have turned to big datasets and deep brain imaging datasets. Big datasets enable the exploration of inter-subject variations, while deep brain imaging datasets, involving repeated scanning of multiple subjects over time, offer detailed insights into intra-subject variability. Despite the availability of numerous big datasets, the number of deep brain imaging datasets remains limited. In this article, we present a deep brain imaging dataset derived from the Bergen Breakfast Scanning Club (BBSC) project. The dataset comprises data collected from three subjects who underwent repeated scanning over the course of approximately one year. Specifically, three types of data chunks were collected: behavioral data, functional brain data, and structural brain data. Functional brain images, encompassing magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), along with their anatomical reference T1-weighted brain images, were collected twice a week during the data collection period. In total, 38, 40, and 25 sessions of functional data were acquired for subjects 1, 2, and 3, respectively. On the other hand, structural brain images, including T2-weighted brain images, diffusion-weighted images (DWI), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, were obtained once a month. A total of 10, 9, and 6 sessions were collected for subjects 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n\nThe primary objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive description of the data acquisition protocol employed in the BBSC project, as well as detailed insights into the preprocessing steps applied to the acquired data.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal area CA3 is thought to play a central role in memory formation and retrieval. Although various network mechanisms have been hypothesized to mediate these computations, direct evidence is lacking. Using intracellular membrane potential recordings from CA3 neurons and optogenetic manipulations in behaving mice we found that place field activity is produced by a symmetric form of Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP) at recurrent synaptic connections among CA3 principal neurons but not at synapses from the dentate gyrus (DG). Additional manipulations revealed that excitatory input from the entorhinal cortex (EC) but not DG was required to update place cell activity based on the animals movement. These data were captured by a computational model that used BTSP and an external updating input to produce attractor dynamics under online learning conditions. Additional theoretical results demonstrate the enhanced memory storage capacity of such networks, particularly in the face of correlated input patterns. The evidence sheds light on the cellular and circuit mechanisms of learning and memory formation in the hippocampus.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryEvidence from behaving mice points to cellular and circuit mechanisms that underlie observed attractor dynamics in area CA3.",

    "abstract": "Freshwater biomonitoring is essential for aquatic biodiversity conservation. Advances in high-throughput sequencing allowed parallel sequencing of community samples containing DNA from environmental samples, i.e., metabarcoding. Two approaches of DNA-based method are widely used, bulk-sample metabarcoding the use of bulk tissues such as insects and eDNA the use of environmental samples such as air, water and soil. Despite the novelty of this approach for routine freshwater biomonitoring, questions still need to be answered about its applicability and reliability due to confounding factors, e.g., sample type, laboratory technicalities, and limitations of databases. Hence, studies on direct comparisons are essential to validate the efficiency of these molecular approaches compared to the conventional morphological approach to accurately assessed biodiversity for riverine benthic macroinvertebrate biomonitoring. This study used three approaches to estimate diversity and composition of benthic macroinvertebrates. We also evaluated the relationship between benthic macroinvertebrate communities and environmental factors. We morphologically identified 8,052 individuals from 35 families, 31 genera, and 29 species. eDNA metabarcoding identified 51 families, 84 genera, and 90 species, while 37 families, 55 genera, and 107 species were detected through bulk-sample metabarcoding. We report that bulk-sample metabarcoding showed finer taxonomic resolution than other approaches.

    "abstract": "Despite being previously regarded as extremely unlikely, the idea that entirely novel protein-coding genes can emerge from non-coding sequences has gradually become accepted over the past two decades. Examples of \"de novo origination\", resulting in lineage-specific \"orphan\" genes, lacking orthologs, are now produced every year. However, many are likely cases of duplicates that are difficult to recognize. Here, I re-examine the claims and show that four very well-known examples of genes alleged to have emerged de novo \"from scratch\" - namely FLJ33706 in humans, Goddard in fruit flies, BSC4 in bakers yeast and AFGP2 in codfish - all have plausible evolutionary ancestors in pre-existing genes. In the case of the first two, highly diverged retrogenes that code for regulatory proteins may have been misidentified as being orphans. The antifreeze glycoproteins in cod, moreover, are shown to have likely not evolved from repetitive non-genic sequences but, as in other related cases, from an apolipoprotein that may well have been pseudogenized before later being reactivated. These findings detract from various claims made about de novo gene birth and show there has been a tendency not to invest the necessary effort in searching for homologs outside of a very limited syntenic or phylostratigraphic methodology. An approach used here for improving homology detection draws upon similarities, not just in terms of statistical sequence analysis, but also with biochemistry and function, in order to obviate failure.",

We present an empirical Bayesian method, STAREG, for identifying replicable spatially variable genes in data generated from various spatially resolved transcriptomic techniques. STAREG models the joint distribution of p-values from different studies with a mixture model and accounts for the heterogeneity of different studies. It provides effective control of the false discovery rate and has higher power by borrowing information across genes and different studies. Moreover, it provides different rankings of important spatially variable genes. With the EM algorithm in combination with pool-adjacent-violator-algorithm (PAVA), STAREG is scalable to datasets with tens of thousands of genes measured on tens of thousands of spatial spots without any tuning parameters. Analyzing three pairs of spatially resolved transcriptomic datasets using STAREG, we show that it makes biological discoveries that otherwise cannot be obtained by using existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale imputation reference panels are now available and have contributed to efficient genome-wide association studies through genotype imputation. However, it is still under debate whether large-size multi-ancestry or small-size population-specific reference panels are the optimal choices for under-represented populations. We imputed genotypes of East Asian (EAS; 180k Japanese) subjects using the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) reference panel and found that the standard imputation quality metric (Rsq) substantially overestimated the dosage r2 (squared correlation between imputed dosage and true genotype). Variance component analysis of Rsq revealed that the increased imputed-genotype certainty (dosages closer to 0, 1, or 2) caused upward bias, indicating some systemic bias in the imputation. Through systematic simulations using different template switching rates ({theta} value) in the hidden Markov model, we uncovered that the lower {theta} value increased the imputed-genotype certainty and Rsq; however, dosage r2 was insensitive to the {theta} value, thereby causing a deviation. In simulated reference panels with different sizes and ancestral diversities, the {theta} value estimates from Minimac decreased with the size of a single ancestry and increased with the ancestral diversity. Thus, Rsq could overestimate or underestimate dosage r2 for a subpopulation in the multi-ancestry panel and the deviation represents different imputed-dosage distributions. Finally, despite the impact of {theta} value, distant ancestries in the reference panel contributed only a few additional variants passing a predefined Rsq threshold. We conclude that the {theta} value has a substantial impact on the imputed dosage and the imputation quality metric value.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is highly comorbid with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Previously, using a lateral fluid percussion model (LFP) (an open model of head injury) to generate a single mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI), we showed that TBI produces escalation in alcohol drinking, that alcohol exposure negatively impacts TBI outcomes, and that the endocannabinoid degradation inhibitor (JZL184) confers significant protection from behavioral and neuropathological outcomes in male rodents. In the present study, we used a weight drop model (a closed model of head injury) to produce a repeated mild TBI (rmTBI, 3 TBIs, spaced by 24 hours) to examine the sex-specific effects on alcohol consumption and anxiety-like behavior in rats, and whether systemic treatment with JZL184 would reverse TBI effects on those behaviors in both sexes. In two separate studies, adult male and female Wistar rats were subjected to rmTBI or sham using the weight drop model. Physiological measures of injury severity were collected from all animals. Animals in both studies were allowed to consume alcohol using an intermittent 2-bottle choice procedure (12 pre-TBI sessions and 12 post-TBI sessions). Neurological severity and neurobehavioral scores (NSS and NBS, respectively) were tested 24 hours after the final injury. Anxiety-like behavior was tested at 37-38 days post-injury in Study 1, and 6-8 days post-injury in Study 2. Our results show that females exhibited reduced respiratory rates relative to males with no significant differences between Sham and rmTBI, no effect of rmTBI or sex on righting reflex, and increased neurological deficits in rmTBI groups in both studies. In Study 1, rmTBI increased alcohol consumption in female but not male rats. Male rats consistently exhibited higher levels of anxiety-like behavior than females. rmTBI did not affect anxiety-like behavior 37-38 days post-injury. In Study 2, rmTBI once again increased alcohol consumption in female but not male rats, and repeated systemic treatment with JZL184 did not affect alcohol consumption. Also in Study 2, rmTBI increased anxiety-like behavior in males but not females and repeated systemic treatment with JZL184 produced an unexpected increase in anxiety-like behavior 6-8 days post-injury. In summary, rmTBI increased alcohol consumption in female rats, systemic JZL184 treatment did not alter alcohol consumption, and both rmTBI and sub-chronic systemic JZL184 treatment increased anxiety-like behavior 6-8 days post-injury in males but not females, highlighting robust sex differences in rmTBI effects.",

    "abstract": "How evolution at the cellular level potentiates change at the macroevolutionary level is a major question in evolutionary biology. With >66,000 described species, rove beetles (Staphylinidae) comprise the largest metazoan family. Their exceptional radiation has been coupled to pervasive biosynthetic innovation whereby numerous lineages bear defensive glands with diverse chemistries. Here, we combine comparative genomic and single-cell transcriptomic data from across the largest rove beetle clade, Aleocharinae. We retrace the functional evolution of two novel secretory cell types that together comprise the tergal gland--a putative catalyst behind Aleocharinaes megadiversity. We identify key genomic contingencies that were critical to the assembly of each cell type and their organ-level partnership in manufacturing the beetles defensive secretion. This process hinged on evolving a mechanism for regulated production of noxious benzoquinones that appears convergent with plant toxin release systems, and synthesis of an effective benzoquinone solvent that weaponized the total secretion. We show that this cooperative biosynthetic system arose at the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary, and that following its establishment, both cell types underwent [~]150 million years of stasis, their chemistry and core molecular architecture maintained almost clade-wide as Aleocharinae radiated globally into tens of thousands of lineages. Despite this deep conservation, we show that the two cell types have acted as substrates for the emergence of adaptive, biochemical novelties--most dramatically in symbiotic lineages that have infiltrated social insect colonies and produce host behavior-manipulating secretions. Our findings uncover genomic and cell type evolutionary processes underlying the origin, functional conservation and evolvability of a chemical innovation in beetles.",

    "abstract": "Histone modifications are an integral component of eukaryotic genome regulation. Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) is responsible for depositing histone H2A lysine 119 monoubiquitylation (H2AK119ub) and can work cooperatively with PRC2-mediated histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) to maintain gene repression. However, H3K27me3-independent functions and roles in gene activation have also been described for PRC1. Thus, the extent to which Polycomb complexes and their corresponding histone modifications function together or independently and the conservation of these roles in different organisms is unclear. Using C. elegans as a model, we investigated the relationship between H2AK119ub and H3K27me3. Here we show that the majority of H2AK119ub and H3K27me3 enrichment across the genome in embryos is distinct, and that the bulk levels of these modifications are regulated independently. We identify many genes related to nervous system development and functionality that have H2AK119ub-enriched promoters and are misregulated in H2AK119ub-deficient mutants, including a subset of genes that are normally H3K27me3-repressed. Surprisingly, we also find an enrichment of H2AK119ub at enhancers, including enhancers proximal to genes which are both up-regulated and down-regulated following the loss of this histone modification. Together, our results indicate a dual role for H2AK119ub in the regulation of both H3K27me3-repressed and enhancer chromatin states.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) converts the energy of substrate oxidation into a H+ electrochemical gradient ({Delta}p), which is composed by an inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) potential ({Delta}{Psi}mt) and a pH gradient ({Delta}pH). So far, {Delta}{Psi}mt has been assumed to be composed exclusively by H+. Mitochondrial Ca2+ and Na+ homeostasis, which are essential for cellular function, are controlled by exchangers and antiporters in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). In the last few years, some of them have been identified, except for the mitochondrial Na+/H+ exchanger (mNHE). Here, using a rainbow of mitochondrial and nuclear genetic models, we have identified it as, specifically, the P-module of complex I (CI). In turn, its activity creates a Na+ gradient across the IMM, parallel to {Delta}pH, which accounts for half of the {Delta}{Psi}mt in coupled respiring mitochondria. We have also found that a deregulation of this mNHE function in CI, without affecting its enzymatic activity, occurs in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), which has profound consequences in {Delta}{Psi}mt and mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis and explains the previously unknown molecular pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of the fitness and stability of a protein upon mutations is of high importance in protein engineering and design. Despite the rapid development of deep learning techniques and accumulation of experimental data, the multi-labeled nature of fitness data hinders the training of robust deep-learning-based models for the fitness and stability prediction tasks. Here, we propose three geometric-learning-based models, GeoFitness, GeoDDG and GeoDTm, for the prediction of the fitness score, {Delta}{Delta}G and {Delta}Tm of a protein upon mutations, respectively. In the optimization of GeoFitness, we designed a novel loss function to allow supervised training of a unified model using the large amount of multi-labeled fitness data in the deep mutational scanning (DMS) database. By this means, GeoFitness efficiently learns the general functional effects of protein mutations and achieves better performance over the other state-of-the-art methods. To further improve the downstream tasks of {Delta}{Delta}G/{Delta}Tm prediction, we re-utilized the encoder of GeoFitness as a pre-trained module in GeoDDG and GeoDTm to overcome the challenge of lack of sufficient amount of specifically labeled data. This pre-training strategy in combination with data expansion remarkably improves model performance and generalizability. When evaluated on the benchmark test sets (S669 for {Delta}{Delta}G prediction and a newly collected set S571 for {Delta}Tm prediction), GeoDDG and GeoDTm outperform the other state-of-the-art methods by at least 35% and 70%, respectively, in terms of the Spearman correlation coefficient between predicted and experimental values. An online server for the suite of these three predictors, GeoStab-suite, is available at http://structpred.life.tsinghua.edu.cn/server_geostab.html.",

However, the specific computational problem being solved by grid cells has remained elusive. We here provide mathematical proof that spatial periodicity in grid cell firing is the only possible solution to a neural sequence code of 2D trajectories and that the hexagonal firing pattern of grid cells is the most parsimonious solution to such a sequence code. We thereby provide a teleological cause for the existence of grid cells and reveal the underlying nature of the global geometrical organization in grid maps as a direct consequence of a simple local sequence code using a minimal number of neurons.

    "abstract": "The vagus nerve plays a critical role in balancing the bodys physiological functions, including the cardiovascular system. Measures of heart rate (HR) and its variability (HRV) may provide non-invasive proxies of vagal activity in humans, but transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has produced mixed effects so far--limited by a lack of studies stimulating the right branch. Here, we used a randomized cross-over design to study the effects of taVNS on HR and HRV. To estimate how the side of the stimulation (left vs. right ear) affects cardiovascular function, we recorded an electrocardiogram in four sessions per person (factors: Stimulation x Side). To evaluate potential interactions with physiological states, we investigated three phases per session: baseline, during stimulation (taVNS vs. sham), and after consuming a milkshake ([~]400 kcal) with concurrent stimulation. First, we found moderate evidence against an effect of taVNS on HR (BF10=0.21). Second, taVNS decreased HRV (multivariate p =.004) independent of physiological state with strong evidence for RMSSD (BF10=15.11) and HF-HRV (BF10=11.80). Third, taVNS-induced changes were comparable across sides and more strongly correlated (vs. sham), indicating similar cardiovascular effects independent of the stimulation side. We conclude that taVNS reduces HRV without altering HR, contradicting the common assumption that increased HRV indexes a heightened vagal tone. Instead, our results support a putative role of vagal afferent activation in arousal. Crucially, modulatory effects on the cardiovascular system can be safely elicited by taVNS on both sides, opening new options for treatment.\n\nGraphical AbstractCreated with BioRender.com\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=129 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/542695v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b6a615org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@51bcf7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4d047forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@626251_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family is a crucial component of heterochromatin with diverse functions in gene regulation, cell cycle control, and cell differentiation. In humans, there are three paralogs, HP1, HP1{beta}, and HP1{gamma}, which exhibit remarkable similarities in their domain architecture and sequence properties. Nevertheless, these paralogs display distinct behaviors in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a process linked to heterochromatin formation. Here, we employ a coarse-grained simulation framework to uncover the sequence features responsible for the observed differences in LLPS. We highlight the significance of the net charge and charge patterning along the sequence in governing paralog LLPS propensities. We also show that both highly conserved folded and less-conserved disordered domains contribute to the observed differences. Furthermore, we explore the potential co-localization of different HP1 paralogs in multicomponent assemblies and the impact of DNA on this process. Importantly, our study reveals that DNA can significantly reshape the stability of a minimal condensate formed by HP1 paralogs due to competitive interactions of HP1 with HP1{beta} and HP1{gamma} versus DNA. In conclusion, our work highlights the physicochemical nature of interactions that govern the distinct phase-separation behaviors of HP1 paralogs and provides a molecular framework for understanding their role in chromatin organization.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=144 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/542535v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d2dcb6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9837d1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17881d3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9359f0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Distinct interaction patterns of HP1 paralogs, in concert with DNA modulation, induce the organization of chromatin via liquid-liquid phase separation.\n\nC_FIG",

We aimed to identify novel actionable mechanisms to overcome such resistance.\n\nMethodsThree paclitaxel (PR) and gemcitabine resistant (GR) PDAC models were established. Transcriptomics and proteomics were used to identify conserved mechanisms of drug resistance. Genetic and pharmacological approaches were used to overcome paclitaxel resistance.\n\nResultsUpregulation of ABCB1 through locus amplification was identified as a conserved feature unique to PR cells. ABCB1 was not affected in any of the GR models and no cross resistance was observed. The ABCB1 inhibitor verapamil or siRNA mediated ABCB1 depletion sensitized PR cells to paclitaxel and prevented efflux of ABCB1 substrates in all models. ABCB1 expression was detected in PDAC patients that had received gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel treatment. A pharmacological screen identified known and novel kinase inhibitors that attenuate efflux of ABCB1 substrates and sensitize PR PDAC cells to paclitaxel.\n\nConclusionUpregulation of ABCB1 through locus amplification represents a novel, conserved mechanism of PDAC paclitaxel resistance. ABCB1 has not been previously implicated in PR PDAC. The synthetic lethal interactions identified in this study can be further (pre)clinically explored as therapeutic strategies to overcome paclitaxel resistance in PDAC.",

    "abstract": "Despite their immense success as a model of macaque visual cortex, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have struggled to predict activity in visual cortex of the mouse, which is thought to be strongly dependent on the animals behavioral state. Furthermore, most computational models focus on predicting neural responses to static images presented under head fixation, which are dramatically different from the dynamic, continuous visual stimuli that arise during movement in the real world. Consequently, it is still unknown how natural visual input and different behavioral variables may integrate over time to generate responses in primary visual cortex (V1). To address this, we introduce a multimodal recurrent neural network that integrates gaze-contingent visual input with behavioral and temporal dynamics to explain V1 activity in freely moving mice. We show that the model achieves state-of-the-art predictions of V1 activity during free exploration and demonstrate the importance of each component in an extensive ablation study. Analyzing our model using maximally activating stimuli and saliency maps, we reveal new insights into cortical function, including the prevalence of mixed selectivity for behavioral variables in mouse V1. In summary, our model offers a comprehensive deep-learning framework for exploring the computational principles underlying V1 neurons in freely-moving animals engaged in natural behavior.",

Despite NPM1 mutation being the most common driver mutation in cytogenetically normal adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the mechanisms of NPM1c+-induced leukemogenesis remain unclear. Caspase-2 is a pro-apoptotic protein activated by NPM1 in the nucleolus. Here, we show that caspase-2 is also activated by NPM1c+ in the cytoplasm, and DNA damage-induced apoptosis is caspase-2-dependent in NPM1c+ AML but not in NPM1wt cells. Strikingly, in NPM1c+ cells, loss of caspase-2 results in profound cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and down-regulation of stem cell pathways that regulate pluripotency including impairment in the AKT/mTORC1 and Wnt signaling pathways. In contrast, there were minimal differences in proliferation, differentiation, or the transcriptional profile of NPM1wt cells with and without caspase-2. Together, these results show that caspase-2 is essential for proliferation and self-renewal of AML cells that have mutated NPM1. This study demonstrates that caspase-2 is a major effector of NPM1c+ function and may even be a druggable target to treat NPM1c+ AML and prevent relapse.",

Using both mouse (T4888M) and human (C643) derived fluorescently labeled ATC cell lines we show these cell lines display different engraftment rates, mass volume, proliferation, and angiogenic potential. Next, using a PIP-FUCCI reporter to track proliferation in-vivo we observed cells in each phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, we performed long-term non-invasive intravital microscopy over 48 hours to understand cellular dynamics in the tumor microenvironment at the single cell level. Lastly, we tested a well-known mTOR inhibitor to show our model could be used as an effective screening platform for new therapeutic compounds.

However, current methods for artificial control of cerebral circulation can abolish pulsatility-dependent vascular signaling or neural network phenomena such as the electrocorticogram even when preserving individual neuronal activity. Thus, we set out to mechanically render cerebral hemodynamics fully regulable to replicate or modify native pig brain perfusion. To this end, blood flow to the head was surgically separated from the systemic circulation and full extracorporeal pulsatile circulatory control (EPCC) delivered via a modified aorta or brachiocephalic artery. This control relied on a computerized algorithm that maintained, for several hours, blood pressure, flow and pulsatility at near-native values individually measured before EPCC. Continuous electrocorticography and brain depth electrode recordings were used to evaluate brain activity relative to the standard offered by awake human electrocorticography. Under EPCC, this activity remained unaltered or minimally perturbed compared to the native circulation state, as did cerebral oxygenation, pressure, temperature and microscopic structure. Thus, our approach enables the study of neural activity and its circulatory manipulation in independence of most of the rest of the organism.",

Relative to traditional machine learning methods or deep learning methods applied to extracted features, there are fewer methods for developing deep learning models on small raw EEG datasets. One potential approach for enhancing deep learning performance in this case is the use of transfer learning. In this study, we propose a novel EEG transfer learning approach wherein we first train a model on a large publicly available sleep stage classification dataset. We then use the learned representations to develop a classifier for automated major depressive disorder diagnosis with raw multichannel EEG. We find that our approach improves model performance, and we further examine how transfer learning affected the representations learned by the model through a pair of explainability analyses. Our proposed approach represents a significant step forward for the domain raw resting-state EEG classification. Furthermore, it has the potential to expand the use of deep learning methods across more raw EEG datasets and lead to the development of more reliable EEG classifiers.\n\nClinical RelevanceThe proposed approach takes the field of deep learning in EEG a step closer to the robustness needed for clinical implementation.",

    "abstract": "Lewy bodies (LBs), rich in -synuclein, are a hallmark of Parkinsons disease (PD). Understanding their biogenesis is likely to provide insight into the pathophysiology of PD, yet a cellular model for LB formation remains elusive. The realization that immune challenge is a trigger for neurodevelopmental disease has been a breakthrough in the understanding of PD. Here, iPSC-derived human dopaminergic (DA) neurons from multiple healthy donors were found to form LB-like inclusions following treatment with -synuclein preformed fibrils, but only when coupled to an immune challenge (interferon-gamma) or when co-cultured with activated microglia. Human cortical neurons derived from the same iPSC lines did not form LB-like inclusions. Exposure to interferon-gamma impairs autophagy in a lysosomal-specific manner in vitro similar to the disruption of proteostasis pathways that contribute to PD. We find that lysosomal membrane proteins LAMP1 and LAMP2 and transcription factors regulating lysosomal biogenesis and function are downregulated in DA but not cortical neurons. Finally, due to the excellent sample preservation afforded by cells compared to post-mortem PD brain tissue, we conclude that the LB-like inclusions in DA neurons are membrane-bound, suggesting they are not limited to the cytoplasmic compartment.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=199 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/542776v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (53K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8e66a5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f500e0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10c9892org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f4a71d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The visual cliff assay (VCA) has been used in multiple animal models including humans to assess stereopsis, the pinnacle percept of binocular function that is markedly disrupted in amblyopia. Amblyopia is a neurodevelopmental disorder of the visual system caused by refractive error, strabismus, or obscuration of the visual axis during infancy and early childhood. While the current standard of care can improve visual acuity in the amblyopic eye, gains are infrequently associated with improvements in stereoscopic depth perception and typically only achieved when treatment is initiated in early childhood. The mouse model of amblyopia induced by monocular deprivation (MD) is a powerful tool to study the mechanistic pathophysiology of this disorder and test novel therapeutics. However, to date, only one study has used the VCA to assess the effects of MD in mice in a limited capacity. Advantages of the VCA include no need for operant conditioning or training, completion in minutes, and minimal equipment. We comprehensively characterize and validate fundamental aspects of the VCA including test-retest reliability and contributions of binocularity using multiple monocular and binocular manipulations with clinically relevant paradigms. After long-term (3 weeks) MD, mice exhibit reduced predilection for the safe side, decreased latency to cross to the cliff side, and more crosses to the cliff side compared to sham littermate controls. Our data demonstrate that the VCA can detect binocular deficits in amblyopia but with important limitations that guide how the VCA should be applied to read out binocular function in both mechanistic and therapeutic studies in mice.",

    "abstract": "Multisensory integration combines information from multiple sensory modalities to create a coherent perception of the world. In contexts where sensory information is limited or equivocal, it also allows animals to integrate individually ambiguous stimuli into a clearer or more accurate percept and, thus, react with a more adaptive behavioral response. Although responses to multisensory stimuli have been described at the neuronal and behavioral levels, a causal or direct link between these two is still missing. In this study, we studied the integration of audiovisual inputs in the Mauthner cell, a command neuron necessary and sufficient to trigger a stereotypical escape response in fish. We performed intracellular recordings while presenting a diverse range of stimuli to determine which stimulus properties affect their integration. Our results show that stimulus modality, intensity, temporal structure, and interstimulus delay affect input summation. Mechanistically, we found that the distinct decay dynamics of feedforward inhibition triggered by auditory and visual stimuli can account for certain aspects of input integration. Altogether, this is the first study to investigate multisensory integration in a cell of clear behavioral relevance and provides a phenomenological and mechanistic characterization of how multisensory integration depends on stimulus properties.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn real-world scenarios where sensory information can be ambiguous, mechanisms that reduce the uncertainty and increase information about potential threats is of critical importance. During multisensory integration, independent signals from an event are combined to form a percept with enhanced information. The Mauthner cell is a paramount example of an identified brainstem neural circuit in fish that decides whether or not to execute a fast escape, directly contributing to the animal survival. Here we show that the mechanistic implementation of multisensory integration at a single-cell level in the Mauthner cell results from properties of the sensory inputs, restrictions imposed by intrinsic properties, neuronal architecture and network inhibitory effects. Importantly, this multisensory response enhancement has direct and unequivocal impact in animal behavior and survival.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by memory loss and progressive cognitive impairments. In mouse models of AD pathology, studies have found neuronal and synaptic deficits in the hippocampus, but less is known about what happens in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), which is the primary spatial input to the hippocampus and an early site of AD pathology. Here, we measured the neuronal intrinsic excitability and synaptic activity in MEC layer II (MECII) stellate cells, MECII pyramidal cells, and MEC layer III (MECIII) excitatory neurons at early (3 months) and late (10 months) time points in the 3xTg mouse model of AD pathology. At 3 months of age, prior to the onset of memory impairments, we found early hyperexcitability in MECII stellate and pyramidal cells intrinsic properties, but this was balanced by a relative reduction in synaptic excitation (E) compared to inhibition (I), suggesting intact homeostatic mechanisms regulating activity in MECII. Conversely, MECIII neurons had reduced intrinsic excitability at this early time point with no change in the synaptic E/I ratio. By 10 months of age, after the onset of memory deficits, neuronal excitability of MECII pyramidal cells and MECIII excitatory neurons was largely normalized in 3xTg mice. However, MECII stellate cells remained hyperexcitable and this was further exacerbated by an increased synaptic E/I ratio. This observed combination of increased intrinsically and synaptically generated excitability suggests a breakdown in homeostatic mechanisms specifically in MECII stellate cells at this post-symptomatic time point. Together, these data suggest that the breakdown in homeostatic excitability mechanisms in MECII stellate cells may contribute to the emergence of memory deficits in AD.",

    "abstract": "Error monitoring is an essential human ability underlying learning and metacognition. In the time domain, humans possess a remarkable ability to learn and adapt to temporal intervals, yet the neural mechanisms underlying this are not well understood. Recently, we demonstrated that humans exhibit improvements in sensorimotor time estimates when given the chance to incorporate feedback from a previous trial (Bader and Wiener 2021), suggesting that humans are metacognitively aware of their own timing errors. To test the neural basis of this metacognitive ability, human participants of both sexes underwent fMRI while they performed a visual temporal reproduction task with randomized suprasecond intervals (1-6s). Crucially, each trial was repeated following feedback, allowing a \"re-do\" to learn from the successes or errors in the initial trial. Behaviorally, we replicated our previous finding that subjects improve their performance on re-do trials despite the feedback being temporally uninformative (i.e. early or late). For neuroimaging, we observed a dissociation between estimating and reproducing time intervals, with the former more likely to engage regions associated with the default mode network (DMN), including the superior frontal gyri, precuneus, and posterior cingulate, whereas the latter activated regions associated traditionally with the \"Timing Network\" (TN), including the supplementary motor area (SMA), precentral gyrus, and right supramarginal gyrus. Notably, greater DMN involvement was observed in Re-do trials. Further, the extent of the DMN was greater on re-do trials, whereas for the TN it was more constrained. Finally, Task-based connectivity between these networks demonstrated higher inter-network correlation on initial trials, but primarily when estimating trials, whereas on re-do trials communication was higher during reproduction. Overall, these results suggest the DMN and TN work in concert to mediate subjective awareness of ones sense of time for the purpose of improving timing performance.\n\nSignificance StatementA finely tuned sense of time perception is imperative for everyday motor actions (e.g., hitting a baseball). Timing self-regulation requires correct assessment and updating duration estimates if necessary. Using a modified version of a classical task of time measurement, we explored the neural regions involved in error detection, time awareness, and learning to time. Reinforcing the role of the SMA in measuring temporal information and providing evidence of co-activation with the DMN, this study demonstrates that the brain overlays sensorimotor timing with a metacognitive awareness of its passage.",

    "abstract": "The alignment between deep neural network (DNN) features and cortical responses currently provides the most accurate quantitative explanation for higher visual areas [1, 2, 3, 4]. At the same time, these model features have been critiqued as uninterpretable explanations, trading one black box (the human brain) for another (a neural network). In this paper, we train networks to directly predict, from scratch, brain responses to images from a large-scale dataset of natural scenes [5]. We then employ \"network dissection\" [6], a method used for enhancing neural network interpretability by identifying and localizing the most significant features in images for individual units of a trained network, and which has been used to study category selectivity in the human brain [7]. We adapt this approach to create a hypothesis-neutral model that is then used to explore the tuning properties of specific visual regions beyond category selectivity, which we call \"brain dissection\". We use brain dissection to examine a range of ecologically important, intermediate properties, including depth, surface normals, curvature, and object relations and find consistent feature selectivity differences across sub-regions of the parietal, lateral, and ventral visual streams. For example, in the three scene-selective network we find that RSC prefers far depths and in-plane horizontal surface normals, while OPA and PPA prefer near and mid depths and vertical surface normals, indicating a change in the spatial coordinate system used for scene representations across RSC and OPA/PPA. Such findings contribute to a deeper, more fine-grained understanding of the functional characteristics of human visual cortex when viewing natural scenes.

    "abstract": "The rebound-competent viral reservoir (RCVR), comprised of virus that is able to persist during antiretroviral therapy (ART) and mediate reactivation of systemic viral replication and rebound viremia after antiretroviral therapy interruption (ATI), remains the biggest obstacle to the eradication of HIV infection. A better understanding of the cellular and tissue origins and the dynamics of viral populations that initiate rebound upon ATI could help develop targeted therapeutic strategies for reducing the RCVR. In this study, barcoded SIVmac239M was used to infect rhesus macaques to enable monitoring of viral barcode clonotypes contributing to virus detectable in plasma after ATI. Blood, lymphoid tissues (LTs, spleen, mesenteric and inguinal lymph nodes), and non-lymphoid tissues (NLTs, colon, ileum, lung, liver, and brain) were analyzed using viral barcode sequencing, intact proviral DNA assay, single-cell RNA sequencing, and combined CODEX/RNAscope/in situ hybridization. Four of seven animals had viral barcodes detectable by deep sequencing of plasma at necropsy although plasma viral RNA remained < 22 copies/mL. Among the tissues studied, mesenteric and inguinal lymph nodes, and spleen contained viral barcodes detected in plasma, and trended to have higher cell-associated viral loads, higher intact provirus levels, and greater diversity of viral barcodes. CD4+ T cells were the main cell type harboring viral RNA (vRNA) after ATI. Further, T cell zones in LTs showed higher vRNA levels than B cell zones for most animals. These findings are consistent with LTs contributing to virus present in plasma early after ATI.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe reemerging of SIV clonotypes at early post-ATI are likely from the secondary lymphoid tissues.",

    "abstract": "Chronic implant-related bone infections are a severe complication in orthopedic surgery. Biofilm formation on the implant surface impairs an effective immune response leading to bacterial persistence. In a previous study, we found that Staphylococcus aureus (SA) induced IRF3 activation and Ifnb gene expression only in its planktonic form but not in the biofilm. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in this process.\n\nWe treated murine RAW 264.7 macrophages with conditioned media (CM) generated from planktonic or biofilm cultured SA in combination with agonists or inhibitors of the cGAS/STING pathway. We further evaluated bacterial gene expression of planktonic and biofilm SA to find potential mediators. STING inhibition resulted in a loss of IRF3 activation and Ifnb induction in SA planktonic CM, whereas STING activation induced an IRF3 dependent IFN-{beta} response in SA biofilm CM. Expression levels of genes associated with virulence decreased with biofilm formation while those associated with cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) synthesis did not correlate with Ifnb induction. We further observed that cGAS contributed to the Ifnb induction by SA planktonic CM although cGAS activation was not sufficient to induce Ifnb gene expression in SA biofilm CM.\n\nOur data indicate that the different degrees of virulence associated with planktonic and biofilm SA environments result in an altered induction of an IRF3 mediated IFN-{beta} response via the STING pathway. This finding suggests that the STING/IRF3/IFN-{beta} axis is a potential candidate for further investigation as immunotherapeutic target in implant-related bone infections.",

Nevertheless, the subcellular localization of OAS3 and RNase L during the antiviral response has remained elusive. Herein, we show that upon activation in response to double-stranded RNA or viral infection, OAS3 and RNase L integrate into higher-order cytoplasmic assemblies distinct from stress granules (SGs), RNase L-induced bodies (RLBs), or processing bodies (P-bodies). We identified these assemblies as double-stranded RNA-induced foci (dRIF), which also contain activated protein kinase R (PKR). We observed incorporation of RNase L, OAS3, and PKR in dRIFs during Zika virus and dengue virus infection. Our data support that condensation of dsRNA, OAS3 and RNase L at dRIFs promotes the homodimerization and oligomerization of RNase L required for its rapid activation, demonstrating a fundamental role for biological condensates in activating antiviral signaling.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulated immune responses contribute to pathogenesis of COVID-19 leading to uncontrolled and exaggerated inflammation observed during severe COVID-19. However, it remains unclear how immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is induced and subsequently controlled. Notably, here we have uncovered an important role for complement in the induction of innate and adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Complement rapidly opsonized SARS-CoV-2 via the lectin pathway. Complement-opsonized SARS-CoV-2 efficiently interacted with dendritic cells (DCs), inducing type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, which were inhibited by antibodies against the complement receptors (CR)3 and CR4. These data suggest that complement is important in inducing immunity via DCs in the acute phase against SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, serum from COVID-19 patients as well as monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 attenuated innate and adaptive immunity induced by complement-opsonized SARS-CoV-2. Blocking the FcyRII, CD32, restored complement-induced immunity. These data strongly suggest that complement opsonization of SARS-CoV-2 is important for inducing innate and adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent induction of antibody responses is important to limit the immune responses and restore immune homeostasis. These data suggest that dysregulation in complement and FcyRII signalling might underlie mechanisms causing severe COVID-19.",

Polymicrobial interactions may be mediated by contact-dependent proteins with antibacterial properties. The Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) is a macromolecular weapon used by Gram-negative bacteria to translocate proteins into adjacent cells. The T6SS is used by pathogens to escape immune cells, eliminate commensal bacteria, and facilitate infection. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that causes a wide range of infections in immunocompromised patients and infects the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis. Infections with the bacterium can be deadly and are challenging to treat because many isolates are multidrug-resistant. We found that globally dispersed S. maltophilia clinical and environmental strains possess T6SS genes. We demonstrate that the T6SS of an S. maltophilia patient isolate is active and can eliminate other bacteria. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the T6SS contributes to the competitive fitness of S. maltophilia against a co-infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate, and that the T6SS alters the cellular organization of S. maltophilia and P. aeruginosa co-cultures. This study expands our knowledge of the mechanisms employed by S. maltophilia to secrete antibacterial proteins and compete against other bacteria.\n\nIMPORTANCEInfections with the opportunistic pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia can be fatal for immunocompromised patients.

Consumers and industry are increasingly transitioning to low-sugar food formulations, but potential impacts of reduced-sugar on preservative efficacy are barely characterised. In this study, we report enhanced sorbic acid resistance of spoilage yeasts in low-glucose conditions. We had anticipated that low glucose may induce respiratory metabolism, previously shown to be targeted by sorbic acid. However, a shift from respiratory to fermentative metabolism was correlated with the sorbic acid resistance in low glucose. Fermentation-deficient yeast species did not show the low-glucose resistance phenotype. Phenotypes observed for certain yeast deletion strains suggested roles for glucose signalling and repression pathways in the sorbic acid resistance at low glucose. This low- glucose induced sorbic acid resistance was alleviated by supplementing yeast cultures with succinic acid, a metabolic intermediate of respiratory metabolism (and a food-safe additive) that promoted respiration. The results indicate that metabolic adaptation of spoilage yeasts promotes sorbic acid resistance at low glucose, providing new insight into potential spoilage, and preservation, of foodstuffs as both food producers and consumers move towards a reduced-sugar landscape.",

    "abstract": "Across the tree of life, clonal populations--from cancer to chronic bacterial infections -- frequently give rise to subpopulations with different metabolic phenotypes. Metabolic exchange or cross-feeding between subpopulations can have profound effects on both cell phenotypes and population-level behavior. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, subpopulations with loss-of-function mutations in the lasR gene are common. Though LasR is often described for its role in density-dependent virulence factor expression, interactions between genotypes suggest potential metabolic differences. The specific metabolic pathways and regulatory genetics enabling such interactions were previously undescribed. Here, we performed an unbiased metabolomics analysis that revealed broad differences in intracellular metabolomes, including higher levels of intracellular citrate in LasR- strains. We found that while both strains secreted citrate, only LasR- strains, consumed citrate in rich media. Elevated activity of the CbrAB two component system which relieves carbon catabolite repression enabled citrate uptake. Within mixed genotype communities, we found that the citrate responsive two component system TctED and its gene targets OpdH (porin) and TctABC (transporter) required for citrate uptake were induced and required for enhanced RhlR signalling and virulence factor expression in LasR- strains. Enhanced citrate uptake by LasR- strains eliminates differences in RhlR activity between LasR+ and LasR- strains thereby circum-venting the sensitivity of LasR- strains to quorum sensing controlled exoproducts. Citrate cross feeding also induces pyocyanin production in LasR- strains co-cultured with Staphylococcus aureus, another species known to secrete biologically-active concentrations of citrate. Metabolite cross feeding may play unrecognized roles in competitive fitness and virulence outcomes when different cell types are together.\n\nIMPORTANCECross-feeding can change community composition, structure and function. Though cross-feeding has predominantly focused on interactions between species, here we unravel a cross-feeding mechanism between frequently co-observed isolate genotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here we illustrate an example of how such clonally-derived metabolic diversity enables intraspecies cross-feeding. Citrate, a metabolite released by many cells including P. aeruginosa, was differentially consumed between genotypes, and this cross-feeding induced virulence factor expression and fitness in genotypes associated with worse disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIncreasing incidence of invasive group A Streptococcus (iGAS) disease has been reported in Europe and United States over the past several years. Coupled with this are observations of higher rates of resistance to non-beta lactam antimicrobials.\n\nObjectivesThe aim of this study was to characterize iGAS and pharyngitis isolates from West Virginia (WV), a region outside of the US national active bacteria core surveillance purview, where risk factors associated with iGAS infections are prevalent.\n\nMethodsSeventy-seven invasive group A Streptococcus isolates were collected from sixty-seven unique patients at the J.W. Ruby Memorial Hospital Clinical Microbiology Laboratory in WV from 2021-23. Invasive isolates and twenty unique pharyngitis isolates were tested for clindamycin and erythromycin susceptibilities in the clinical laboratory. Patient demographic and clinical information was retrieved from patient electronic health records. Isolates were further characterized based on emm-type and detection of MLSB resistance determinants.\n\nResultsTwenty-six (39%) isolates were of a single emm-type, emm92. All emm92 isolates were uniformly erythromycin/clindamycin resistant with inducible or constitutive MLSB resistance imparted by the plasmid-borne erm(T) gene. The majority of emm92 infections were associated with adult patients who reported intravenous drug use, whereas no pharyngitis infections were caused by an emm92 strain. Overall, fifty-one (76%) of the sixty-seven iGAS isolates were determined to carry MLSB resistance.\n\nConclusionsIsolates of emm-type 92 predominated in this collection, were uniformly erythromycin/clindamycin resistant, and were associated with adult intravenous drug use but not with pediatric pharyngitis.",

    "abstract": "Eating behavior is essential to human health. However, whether future eating behavior is subjected to the conditioning of precedent dietary composition is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of dietary fiber consumption on subsequent nutrient-specific food preferences between palatable high-fat and high-sugar diets and explore its correlation with the gut microbiota. C57BL/6NJcl male mice were subjected to a 2-week dietary intervention and fed either a control (n = 6) or inulin (n = 6) diet. Afterwards, all mice were subjected to a 3-day eating behavioral test to self-select a high-fat or a high-sugar diet. The test diet feed intakes were recorded, and the mices fecal samples were analyzed to evaluate the gut microbiota composition. The inulin mice exhibited a preference for a high-fat diet over a high-sugar diet, associated with distinct gut microbiota compositions profiles between the inulin and control mice. The gut microbiota Bacteroides acidifaciens (99.68%), Bacteroides caecemuris (99.37%), and Bacteroides xylanolyticus (92.28%) positively correlated with a preference for fat. Further studies involving fecal microbiota transplantation and eating behavior-related neurotransmitter analyses may clarify the role of gut microbiota on food preferences. Food preferences induced by dietary intervention are a novel observation, and the gut microbiome may be significantly associated with this preference.",

    "abstract": "Myxovirus resistance proteins (MxA and MxB) are interferon-induced proteins that exert antiviral activity against a diverse range of RNA and DNA viruses. In primates, MxA has been shown to inhibit myxoviruses, bunyaviruses, and hepatitis B virus, whereas MxB restricts retroviruses and herpesviruses. As a result of their conflicts with viruses, both genes have been undergoing diversifying selection during primate evolution. Here, we investigate how MxB evolution in primates has affected its restriction of herpesviruses. In contrast to human MxB, we find that most primate orthologs, including the closely related chimpanzee MxB, do not inhibit HSV-1 replication. However, all primate MxB orthologs tested restrict human cytomegalovirus. Through the generation of human and chimpanzee MxB chimeras we show that a single residue, M83, is the key determinant of restriction of HSV-1 replication. Humans are the only primate species known to encode a methionine at this position, whereas most other primate species encode a lysine. Residue 83 is also the most polymorphic residue in MxB in human populations, with M83 being the most common variant. However, [~]2.5% of human MxB alleles encode a threonine at this position, which does not restrict HSV-1. Thus, a single amino acid variant in MxB, which has recently risen to high frequency in humans, has endowed humans with HSV-1 antiviral activity.\n\nImportanceHerpesviruses present a major global disease burden. Understanding the host cell mechanisms that block viral infections as well as how viruses can evolve to counteract these host defenses is critically important for understanding viral disease pathogenesis, and for developing therapeutic tools aimed at treating or preventing viral infections. Additionally, understanding how these host and viral mechanisms adapt to counter one another can aid in identifying the risks of, and barriers to, cross-species transmission events. As highlighted by the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, episodic transmission events can have severe consequences for human health. This study reveals that the major human variant of the antiviral protein MxB inhibits the human pathogen HSV-1, whereas human minor variants and orthologous MxB genes from even closely related primates do not. Thus, in contrast to the many antagonistic virus-host interactions in which the virus is successful in thwarting the defense systems of their native hosts, in this case the human gene appears to be at least temporarily winning at this interface of the primate-herpesviral evolutionary arms race. Our findings further show that a polymorphism at amino acid 83 in a small fraction of the human population is sufficient to abrogate MxBs ability to inhibit HSV-1, which could have important implications for human susceptibility to HSV-1 pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHuman noroviruses are a leading cause of acute and sporadic gastroenteritis worldwide. The evolution of human noroviruses in immunocompromised persons has been evaluated in many studies. Much less is known about the evolutionary dynamics of human norovirus in healthy adults.\n\nMethodsWe used sequential samples collected from a controlled human infection study with GI.1/Norwalk/US/68 virus to evaluate intra- and inter-host evolution of a human norovirus in healthy adults. Up to 12 samples from day 1 to day 56 post-challenge were sequenced using a norovirus-specific capture probe method.\n\nResultsComplete genomes were assembled, even in samples that were below the limit of detection of standard RT-qPCR assays, up to 28 days post-challenge. Analysis of 123 complete genomes showed changes in the GI.1 genome in all persons, but there were no conserved changes across all persons. Single nucleotide variants resulting in non-synonymous amino acid changes were observed in all proteins, with the capsid VP1 and nonstructural protein NS3 having the largest numbers of changes.\n\nConclusionsThese data highlight the potential of a new capture-based sequencing approach to assemble human norovirus genomes with high sensitivity and demonstrate limited conserved immune pressure-driven evolution of GI.1 virus in healthy adults.",

    "abstract": "To study the adaptation of multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) during treatment patients diagnosed with MDR-TB were recruited into an observational study. Clinical data and M. tuberculosis DNA at diagnosis and between seven days and two months of MDR-TB treatment were collected. The drugs prescribed were recorded. Interpretable WGS data from 118 isolates from 54 participants was obtained (11 in Belarus and 43 in Moldova) and screened for the presence of unfixed single nucleotide polymorphisms (mixed SNPs / loci).\n\nThis study was performed shortly after the publication of the 2019 WHO consolidated guidelines on drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment. Existing drug supplies and procurement in one country after the switch to the all oral MDR-TB regimen in addition to patient factors, influenced the selection of and exposure to drugs.\n\nConfidently mixed SNPs were identified in samples from multiple participants in only five genes (gyrA, pncA, Rv1129c, Rv1148c, and sugI). All other genes with confidently mixed SNPs were identified in isolates from only a single individual. A significant proportion of the participants (52 of 54 participants) received d-cycloserine as part of their initial treatment, most participants who initially received d-cycloserine did not receive bedaquiline in their initial regimen (all at one site). Three different mixed SNPs were identified in sugI gene from a follow up isolate from three participants (P7A, P7T, and Q6stop). Mutations in sugI have previously been reported in spontaneous in vitro d-cycloserine resistant mutants. Alterations in the sugI gene may indicate a sub optimal d-cycloserine containing regimen and potentially be of clinical significance with respect to adaptation to d-cycloserine. Monitoring the accumulation of low frequency escape mutants may help identify regimens insufficiently powerful to block the accumulation of antimicrobial resistance mutants and identify drug(s) at risk of resistance selection.",

    "abstract": "Mucosal barriers provide the first line of defense between internal body surfaces and microbial threats from the outside world.1 In the colon, the barrier consists of two layers of mucus and a single layer of tightly interconnected epithelial cells supported by connective tissue and immune cells.2 Microbes colonize the loose, outer layer of colonic mucus, but are essentially excluded from the tight, epithelial-associated layer by host defenses.3 The amount and composition of the mucus is calibrated based on microbial signals and loss of even a single component of this mixture can destabilize microbial biogeography and increase the risk of disease.4-7 However, the specific components of mucus, their molecular microbial targets, and how they work to contain the gut microbiota are still largely unknown. Here we show that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), the prototypical damage-associated molecular pattern molecule (DAMP), acts as an agent of host mucosal defense in the colon. HMGB1 in colonic mucus targets an evolutionarily conserved amino acid sequence found in bacterial adhesins, including the well-characterized Enterobacteriaceae adhesin FimH. HMGB1 aggregates bacteria and blocks adhesin-carbohydrate interactions, inhibiting invasion through colonic mucus and adhesion to host cells. Exposure to HMGB1 also suppresses bacterial expression of FimH. In ulcerative colitis, HMGB1 mucosal defense is compromised, leading to tissue-adherent bacteria expressing FimH. Our results demonstrate a new, physiologic role for extracellular HMGB1 that refines its functions as a DAMP to include direct, virulence limiting effects on bacteria. The amino acid sequence targeted by HMGB1 appears to be broadly utilized by bacterial adhesins, critical for virulence, and differentially expressed by bacteria in commensal versus pathogenic states. These characteristics suggest that this amino acid sequence is a novel microbial virulence determinant and could be used to develop new approaches to diagnosis and treatment of bacterial disease that precisely identify and target virulent microbes.",

    "abstract": "Selective breakdown of proteins and aggregates is crucial for maintaining normal cellular activities and is involved in the pathogenesis of diverse diseases. How the cell recognizes and tags these targets in different structural states for degradation by the proteasome and autophagy pathways has not been well understood. Here, we discovered that a HECT-family ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 is broadly required for the efficient degradation of soluble factors and for the clearance of protein aggregates/condensates. Underlying this capacity of HUWE1 is a novel Ubiquitin-Directed ubiquitin Ligase (UDL) activity which recognizes both soluble substrates and aggregates that carry a high density of ubiquitin chains and rapidly expand the ubiquitin modifications on these targets. Ubiquitin signal amplification by HUWE1 recruits the ubiquitin-dependent segregase p97/VCP to process these targets for subsequent degradation or clearance. HUWE1 controls the cytotoxicity of protein aggregates, mediates Targeted Protein Degradation and regulates cell-cycle transitions with its UDL activity.",

    "abstract": "Wnt proteins are secreted hydrophobic glycoproteins that act over long distances through poorly understood mechanisms. We discovered that Wnt7a is secreted on extracellular vesicles (EVs) following muscle injury. Structural analysis identified the motif responsible for Wnt7a secretion on EVs that we term the Exosome Binding Peptide (EBP). Addition of the EBP to an unrelated protein directed secretion on EVs. Disruption of palmitoylation, knockdown of WLS, or deletion of the N-terminal signal peptide did not affect Wnt7a secretion on purified EVs. Bio-ID analysis identified Coatomer proteins as candidates responsible for loading Wnt7a onto EVs. The crystal structure of EBP bound to the COPB2 coatomer subunit, the binding thermodynamics, and mutagenesis experiments, together demonstrate that a dilysine motif in the EBP mediates binding to COPB2. Other Wnts contain functionally analogous structural motifs. Mutation of the EBP results in a significant impairment in the ability of Wnt7a to stimulate regeneration, indicating that secretion of Wnt7a on exosomes is critical for normal regeneration in vivo. Our studies have defined the structural mechanism that mediates binding of Wnt7a to exosomes and elucidated the singularity of long-range Wnt signalling.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles-associated adeno-associated viral vectors (EV-AAVs) emerged as a new opportunity for non-invasive gene therapy targeting the central nervous system (CNS). However, in previous reports, only AAV serotypes with known ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) have been used for EV-AAV production and testing through non-invasive strategies. In this work, we aimed at optimizing a size exclusion chromatography (SEC) protocol for the production and isolation of natural and biologically active brain-targeting EV-AAVs, that could be applied to any AAV serotype and further used for non-invasive gene delivery to the CNS. We performed a comparison between SEC and differential ultracentrifugation (UC) isolation protocols in terms of yield, contaminants, and transgene expression efficiency. We found that SEC allows a higher recovery of EV-AAVs, free of cell contaminating proteins and with less solo AAVs than UC. Remarkably, SEC-purified EV-AAVs also showed to be more potent at transgene expression than solo AAVs in neuronal cell lines. EV-AAVs exhibited the ability to cross the BBB in neonatal mice upon intravenous administration. In conclusion, SEC-purified brain-targeting EV-AAVs show to be a promising gene delivery vector for therapy of brain disorders.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/542901v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (70K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7016b8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e3a5f3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a43286org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f110c5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG During the production of AAV vectors, a small percentage of AAVs is secreted in association with extracellular vesicles, named \"EV-AAVs\".
