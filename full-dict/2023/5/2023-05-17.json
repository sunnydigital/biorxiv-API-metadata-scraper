    "abstract": "Successful learning depends on various factors such as depth of processing, motivation, or curiosity about information. A strong drive to learn something or the expectation of receiving a reward can be crucial to enhance learning. However, the influence of curiosity on the processing of information-related feedback and its similarity with reward processing is not well understood. This study examined whether states of curiosity influence specific event-related-potentials (ERPs) associated with reward processing and whether these ERPs are related with later memory benefits. In an initial screening phase, participants indicated their curiosity and confidence about answers to various trivia questions. In a subsequent study phase, we targeted different time windows related to feedback processing during the presentation of trivia answers containing the Reward-Positivity (RewP; 250 - 350 ms), the P3 (250 - 500 ms), and the Late-Positive-Potential (LPP; 600 - 1000 ms). In a delayed surprise memory test, we found that participants recalled more high-than low-curiosity answers. The RewP, P3 and LPP showed greater positive mean amplitudes for high compared to low curiosity, reflecting increased feedback processing. In addition, we found that the RewP and the P3 showed more positive mean amplitudes for later recalled compared to later forgotten answers, but curiosity did not modulate this encoding-related finding. These findings support the view that curiosity can act as an amplifier of reward-related feedback processing and opens the investigation of further curiosity-related ERP studies.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in the extracellular matrix (ECM) are common in epilepsy, yet whether they are cause or consequence of disease is unknow. Using Theilers virus infection model of acquired epilepsy we find de novo expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), a major ECM component, in dentate gyrus (DG) and amygdala exclusively in mice with seizures. Preventing synthesis of CSPGs specifically in DG and amygdala by deletion of major CSPG aggrecan reduced seizure burden. Patch-clamp recordings from dentate granule cells (DGCs) revealed enhanced intrinsic and synaptic excitability in seizing mice that was normalized by aggrecan deletion. In situ experiments suggest that DGCs hyperexcitability results from negatively charged CSPGs increasing stationary cations (K+, Ca2+) on the membrane thereby depolarizing neurons, increasing their intrinsic and synaptic excitability. We show similar changes in CSPGs in pilocarpine-induced epilepsy suggesting enhanced CSPGs in the DG and amygdala may be a common ictogenic factor and novel therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have adopted an edge-centric framework to study fine-scale dynamics in human fMRI. To date, however, no studies have applied this same framework to data collected from model organisms. Here, we analyze structural and functional imaging data from lightly anesthetized mice through an edge-centric lens. We find evidence of \"bursty\" dynamics and events - brief periods of high-amplitude network connectivity. Further, we show that on a per-frame basis events best explain static FC and can be divided into a series of hierarchically-related clusters. The co-fluctuation patterns associated with each centroid link distinct anatomical areas and largely adhere to the boundaries of algorithmically detected functional brain systems. We then investigate the anatomical connectivity undergirding high-amplitude co-fluctuation patterns. We find that events induce modular bipartitions of the anatomical network of inter-areal axonal projections. Finally, we replicate these same findings in a human imaging dataset. In summary, this report recapitulates in a model organism many of the same phenomena observed in previously edge-centric analyses of human imaging data. However, unlike human subjects, the murine nervous system is amenable to invasive experimental perturbations. Thus, this study sets the stage for future investigation into the causal origins of fine-scale brain dynamics and high-amplitude co-fluctuations. Moreover, the cross-species consistency of the reported findings enhances the likelihood of future translation.",

    "abstract": "Elevated anxiety often precedes anorexia nervosa and persists after weight restoration. Patients with anorexia nervosa often describe hunger as pleasant, potentially because food restriction can be anxiolytic. Here, we tested whether chronic stress can cause animals to prefer a starvation-like state. We developed a virtual reality place preference paradigm in which head-fixed mice can voluntarily seek a starvation-like state induced by optogenetic stimulation of hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons. Prior to stress induction, male but not female mice showed mild aversion to AgRP stimulation. Strikingly, following chronic stress, a subset of females developed a strong preference for AgRP stimulation that was predicted by high baseline anxiety. Such stress-induced changes in preference were reflected in changes in facial expressions during AgRP stimulation. Our study suggests that stress may cause females predisposed to anxiety to seek a starvation state, and provides a powerful experimental framework for investigating the underlying neural mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has represented an issue for global health since its outbreak in March 2020. It is now evident that the SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a wide range of long-term neurological symptoms and is worryingly associated with the aggravation of Alzheimers disease. Little is known about the molecular basis of these manifestations.\n\nMethodsSeveral SARS-CoV-2 strain variants were used to infect SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and K18-hACE C57BL/6J mice. The Tau phosphorylation profile and aggregation propensity upon infection were investigated using immunoblot and immunofluorescence on cellular extracts, subcellular fractions, and brain tissue. The viral proteins Spike, Nucleocapsid, and Membrane were overexpressed in SH-SY5Y cells and the direct effect on Tau phosphorylation was checked using immunoblot experiments.\n\nResultsUpon infection, Tau is phosphorylated at several pathological epitopes associated with Alzheimers disease and other tauopathies. Moreover, this event increases Taus propensity to form insoluble aggregates and alters its subcellular localization.\n\nConclusionsOur data support the evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Central Nervous System triggers downstream effects altering Tau function, eventually leading to the impairment of neuronal function.",

    "abstract": "Cellular-resolution manipulation technologies like optogenetics enable so-called causal engram-cell experiments in which learning-activated neurons are tagged with a light-responsive protein (opsin) such that subsequent photostimulation elicits memory behavior. The opsin-tagged neurons are considered key neural circuit elements with photostimulation demonstrating their sufficiency for memory expression. Can the sufficiency interpretation be correct if the brain is a complex dynamical system with adaptive, non-linear, and homeostatic interactions? We find that during photostimulation of place avoidance memory-tagged neurons, mouse CA1 hippocampus activity maintains intrinsic ensemble discharge relationships and the low-dimensional manifold organization of the population dynamics. Although the photostimulation causes spatially-precise conditioned avoidance, such manipulations, are better interpreted as eliciting the endogenous population dynamics of a complex system, rather than the causal demonstration of neural circuit function.",

Here we show that unbounded position variance is indeed observed in a common task, turning a crank. In postural tasks, intermittent control has been proposed to limit position variance. We further show that when position variance is unbounded, it displays a distinctive signature of underlying Brownian motion, a low-frequency power spectrum that declines at -20 dB/decade but exhibits flattening in bounded tasks. Remarkably, a descriptive model of a control system competent to account for all of these data must feature a forward-path velocity command corrupted by stationary noise. This provides independent behavioral support for the theory that the brain encodes motion commands in terms of velocity.",

    "abstract": "Postnatal neurogenesis has been shown to rely on the endocannabinoid system. Here we aimed at unravelling the role of Cannabidivarin (CBDV), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid, with high affinity for the non-classical cannabinoid receptor TRPV1, on subventricular zone (SVZ) postnatal neurogenesis. Using the neurosphere assay, SVZ-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) were incubated with CBDV and/or 5-Iodoresinferotoxin (TRPV1 antagonist), and their role on cell viability, proliferation, and differentiation were dissected. CBDV was able to promote, through a TRPV1-dependent mechanism, cell survival, cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, pulse-chase experiments revealed that CBDV-induced neuronal differentiation was a result of cell cycle exit of NSPCs. Regarding oligodendrocyte differentiation, CBDV inhibited oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation. Since our data suggested that the CBDV-induced modulation of NSPCs acted via TRPV1, a sodium-calcium channel, and that intracellular calcium levels are known regulators of NSPCs fate and neuronal maturation, single cell calcium imaging was performed to evaluate the functional response of SVZ-derived cells. We observed that CBDV-responsive cells displayed a two-phase calcium influx profile, being the initial phase dependent on TRPV1 activation. Taken together, this work unveiled a novel and untapped neurogenic potential of CBDV via TRPV1 modulation. These findings pave the way to future neural stem cell biological studies and repair strategies by repurposing this non-psychoactive cannabinoid as a valuable therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "The CA1 region of the hippocampus is one of the most studied regions of the rodent brain, thought to play an important role in cognitive functions such as memory and spatial navigation. Despite a wealth of experimental data on its structure and function, it can be challenging to reconcile information obtained from diverse experimental approaches. To address this challenge, we present a community-driven, full-scale in silico model of the rat CA1 that integrates a broad range of experimental data, from synapse to network, including the reconstruction of its principal afferents, the Schaffer collaterals, and a model of the effects that acetylcholine has on the system. We have tested and validated each model component and the final network model, and made input data, assumptions, and strategies explicit and transparent. The flexibility of the model allows scientists to address a range of scientific questions. In this article, we describe the methods used to set up simulations that reproduce and extend in vitro and in vivo experiments. Among several applications in the article, we focus on theta rhythm, a prominent hippocampal oscillation associated with various behavioral correlates and use our computer model to reproduce and reconcile experimental findings. Finally, we make data, code and model available through the hippocampushub.eu portal, which also provides an extensive set of analyses of the model and a user-friendly interface to facilitate adoption and usage. This neuroscience community-driven model represents a valuable tool for integrating diverse experimental data and provides a foundation for further research into the complex workings of the hippocampal CA1 region.",

    "abstract": "The ability to discriminate visual stimuli is constrained by their retinal representations. Previous studies of visual discriminability were limited to either low-dimensional artificial stimuli or theoretical considerations without a realistic model. Here we propose a novel framework for understanding stimulus discriminability achieved by retinal representations of naturalistic stimuli with the method of information geometry. To model the joint probability distribution of neural responses conditioned on the stimulus, we created a stochastic encoding model of a population of salamander retinal ganglion cells based on a three-layer convolutional neural network model. This model not only accurately captured the mean response to natural scenes but also a variety of second-order statistics. With the model and the proposed theory, we are able to compute the Fisher information metric over stimuli and study the most discriminable stimulus directions. We found that the most discriminable stimulus varied substantially, allowing an examination of the relationship between the most discriminable stimulus and the current stimulus. We found that the most discriminative response mode is often aligned with the most stochastic mode. This finding carries the important implication that under natural scenes noise correlations in the retina are information-limiting rather than aiding in increasing information transmission as has been previously speculated. We observed that sensitivity saturates less in the population than for single cells and also that Fisher information varies less than sensitivity as a function of firing rate. We conclude that under natural scenes, population coding benefits from complementary coding and helps to equalize the information carried by different firing rates, which may facilitate decoding of the stimulus under principles of information maximization.",

The models di-rect correspondence with biology generated predictions about how multiscale organisation shapes activity. We predict that structural and functional recurrency increases towards deeper layers and that stronger innervation by long-range connectivity increases local correlated activity. The model also predicts the role of inhibitory interneuron types in stimulus encoding, and of different layers in driving layer 2/3 stimulus responses.

    "abstract": "Dopamine transporter (DAT) controls dopamine signaling in the brain through the reuptake of synaptically released dopamine. DAT is a target of abused psychostimulants such as amphetamine (Amph). Acute Amph is proposed to cause transient DAT endocytosis which among other Amph effects on dopaminergic neurons elevates extracellular dopamine. However, the effects of repeated Amph abuse, leading to behavioral sensitization and drug addiction, on DAT traffic are unknown. Hence, we developed a 14-day Amph-sensitization protocol in knock-in mice expressing HA-epitope tagged DAT (HA-DAT) and investigated effects of Amph challenge on HA-DAT in sensitized animals. Amph challenge resulted in the highest locomotor activity on day 14 in both sexes, which was however sustained for 1 hour in male but not female mice. Strikingly, significant (by 30-60%) reduction in the amount of the HA-DAT protein in striatum was observed in response to Amph challenge of sensitized males but not females. Amph reduced Vmax of dopamine transport in striatal synaptosomes of males without changing Km values. Consistently, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a significant increase of HA-DAT co-localization with the endosomal protein VPS35 only in males. Amph-induced HA-DAT down-regulation in the striatum of sensitized mice was blocked by chloroquine, vacuolin-1 (inhibitor of PIKfive kinase), and inhibitor of Rho-associated kinases (ROCK1/2), indicative of the involvement of endocytic trafficking in DAT down-regulation. Interestingly, HA-DAT protein down-regulation was observed in nucleus accumbens and not in dorsal striatum. We propose that Amph challenge in sensitized mice leads to ROCK-dependent endocytosis and post-endocytic traffic of DAT in a brain-region-specific and sex-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Cancer-related cognitive impairments (CRCI) are debilitating consequences of cancer treatment with platinum agents (e.g., cisplatin) that greatly alter cancer survivors health-related quality of life. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an essential role in neurogenesis, learning, and memory, and the reduction of BDNF is associated with the development of cognitive impairment in various neurological disorders, including CRCI. Our previous CRCI rodent studies have shown that cisplatin reduces hippocampal neurogenesis and BDNF expression and increases hippocampal apoptosis, which is associated with cognitive impairments. Few studies have reported on the effects of chemotherapy and medical stress on serum BDNF levels and cognition in middle-aged female rat models. The present study aimed to compare the effects of medical stress and cisplatin on serum BDNF levels and cognitive performance in 9-month-old female Sprague Dawley rats to age-matched controls. Serum BDNF levels were collected longitudinally during cisplatin treatment, and cognitive function was assessed by novel object recognition (NOR) 14 weeks post-cisplatin initiation. Terminal BDNF levels were collected ten weeks after cisplatin completion. We also screened three BDNF-augmenting compounds, riluzole, ampakine CX546, and CX1739, for their neuroprotective effects on hippocampal neurons, in vitro. We assessed dendritic arborization by Sholl analysis and dendritic spine density by quantifying postsynaptic density-95 (PSD95) puncta. Cisplatin and exposure to medical stress reduced serum BDNF levels and impaired object discrimination in NOR compared to age-matched controls. Pharmacological BDNF augmentation protected neurons against cisplatin-induced reductions in dendritic branching and PSD95. Ampakines (CX546 and CX1739) but not riluzole altered the antitumor efficacy of cisplatin in two human ovarian cancer cell lines, OVCAR8 and SKOV3.ip1, in vitro. In conclusion, we established the first middle-aged rat model of cisplatin-induced CRCI, assessing the contribution of medical stress and longitudinal changes in BDNF levels with cognitive function. We conducted an in vitro screening of BDNF-enhancing agents to evaluate their potential neuroprotective effects against cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity and their effect on ovarian cancer cell viability.",

    "abstract": "The inactivated vaccine CoronaVac is one of the most widely used COVID-19 vaccines globally. However, the longitudinal evolution of the immune response induced by CoronaVac remains elusive compared to other vaccine platforms. Here, we recruited 88 healthy individuals that received 3 doses of CoronaVac vaccine. We longitudinally evaluated their polyclonal and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells and neutralizing antibody response after receiving each dose of vaccine for over 300 days. Both the 2nd and 3rd dose of vaccination induced robust spike-specific neutralizing antibodies, with a 3rd vaccine further increased the overall magnitude of antibody response, and neutralization against Omicron sub-lineages B.1.1.529, BA.2, BA.4/BA.5 and BA.2.75.2. Spike-specific CD4+ T cell and circulating T follicular helper (cTFH) cells were markedly increased by the 2nd and 3rd dose of CoronaVac vaccine, accompanied with altered composition of functional cTFH cell subsets with distinct effector and memory potential. Additionally, cTFH cells are positively correlated with neutralizing antibody titers. Our results suggest that CoronaVac vaccine-induced spike-specific T cells are capable of supporting humoral immunity for long-term immune protection.",

    "abstract": "Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a bio-based, biodegradable alternative to petroleum-based plastics. PHB production at industrial scales remains infeasible, in part due to insufficient yields and high costs. Addressing these challenges requires identifying novel biological chassis for PHB production and modifying known biological chassis to enhance production using sustainable, renewable inputs. Here, we take the former approach and present the first description of PHB production by two prosthecate photosynthetic purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB), Rhodomicrobium vannielii and Rhodomicrobium udaipurense. We show that both species produce PHB across photoheterotrophic, photoautotrophic, photoferrotrophic, and photoelectrotrophic growth conditions. Both species show the greatest PHB titers during photoheterotrophic growth on butyrate with dinitrogen gas as a nitrogen source (up to 44.08 mg/L), while photoelectrotrophic growth demonstrated the lowest titers (up to 0.13 mg/L). These titers are both greater (photoheterotrophy) and less (photoelectrotrophy) than those observed previously in a related PNSB, Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE-1. On the other hand, we observe the highest electron yields during photoautotrophic growth with hydrogen gas or ferrous iron electron donors, and these electron yields were generally greater than those observed previously in TIE-1. These data suggest that non model organisms like Rhodomicrobium should be explored for sustainable PHB production and highlights utility in exploring novel biological chassis.",

    "abstract": "The intraerythrocytic malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum exports hundreds of proteins into the host red blood cell (RBC). Most are targeted to the ER by a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids and cleaved further downstream at a conserved motif called the Protein Export Element (PEXEL) by the ER protease plasmepsin V (PM V). The mature effectors then travel through the secretory pathway to the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that surrounds the parasite. There, PEXEL proteins are somehow recognized as export-destined proteins, as opposed to PV- resident proteins, and are selectively translocated out into the RBC. The mature N terminus appears to be important for export. There is conflicting data on whether PM V cleavage is needed for proper export, or whether any means of generating the mature N terminus would suffice. We replaced the PEXEL-containing N-terminal sequence of an exported GFP reporter with a signal peptide sequence and showed that precise cleavage by signal peptidase, generating the proper mature N terminus, yields export competence. Expressing a construct with only the native ER targeting signal without the PM V cleavage site dramatically decreased the amount of a mature PEXEL reporter, indicating that the hydrophobic stretch lacks an efficient cleavage signal. Therefore, the PEXEL motif functions as a specialized signal cleavage site when appropriately located after an ER targeting sequence. Our data suggest that PM V cleavage and RBC export are two independent events for PEXEL proteins. We also tested and rejected the hypothesis that an alpha-helical mature N terminus is necessary for export.\n\nImportanceMalaria parasites export hundreds of proteins to the cytoplasm of the host red blood cells for their survival. A five amino acid sequence, called the PEXEL motif, is conserved among many exported proteins and is thought to be a signal for export. However, the motif is cleaved inside the endoplasmic reticulum of the parasite and mature proteins starting from the fourth PEXEL residue travel to the parasite periphery for export. We showed that the PEXEL motif is dispensable for export as long as identical mature proteins can be efficiently produced via alternative means in the ER. We also showed that the exported and non-exported proteins are differentiated at the parasite periphery based on their mature N termini, however, any discernible export signal within that region remained cryptic. Our study resolves a longstanding paradox in PEXEL protein trafficking.",

    "abstract": "Antiviral responses are often accompanied by translation inhibition and formation of stress granules (SG) in infected cells. However, the triggers for these processes and their role during infection remain subjects of active investigation. Copy-back viral genomes (cbVGs) are the primary inducers of the Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling (MAVS) pathway and antiviral immunity during Sendai Virus (SeV) and Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) infections. The relationship between cbVGs and cellular stress during viral infections is unknown. Here we show that SG form during infections containing high levels of cbVGs, and not during infections with low levels of cbVGs. Moreover, using RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization to differentiate accumulation of standard viral genomes from cbVGs at a single-cell level during infection, we show that SG form exclusively in cells that accumulate high levels of cbVGs. PKR activation is increased during high cbVG infections and, as expected, PKR is necessary to induce virus-induced SG. However, SG form independent of MAVS signaling, demonstrating that cbVGs induce antiviral immunity and SG formation through two independent mechanisms. Furthermore, we show that translation inhibition and SG formation do not affect the overall expression of interferon and interferon stimulated genes during infection, making the stress response dispensable for antiviral immunity. Using live-cell imaging, we show that SG formation is highly dynamic and correlates with a drastic reduction of viral protein expression even in cells infected for several days. Through analysis of active protein translation at a single cell level, we show that infected cells that form SG show inhibition of protein translation. Together, our data reveal a new cbVG-driven mechanism of viral interference where cbVGs induce PKR-mediated translation inhibition and SG formation leading to a reduction in viral protein expression without altering overall antiviral immunity.\n\nOne Sentence SummarycbVGs trigger the cellular stress response independent of the antiviral response during RSV and parainfluenza virus infection leading to a reduction of virus protein expression.",

Here we show a novel function for these two proteins, in which alanine promotes the formation of a chimeric Nrg1/Rtg3 regulator that represses the ALT2 gene (encoding an alanine transaminase paralogue of unknown function) expression. A NRG1/NRG2 paralogous pair, resulting from a post-wide genome, small scale duplication event, is extant in the Saccharomyces genus. Neo-functionalization of only one paralogue resulted in Nrg1, able to interact with Rtg3. Either nrg1{Delta} or rtg3{Delta} single mutant strains are unable to utilize ethanol and show a typical petite (small) phenotype on glucose. Neither of the WT genes complemented the petite phenotype, suggesting irreversible mitochondrial DNA damage in these mutants. Neither nrg1{Delta} nor rtg3{Delta} mutant strains express genes encoded by any of five polycistronic units transcribed from mitochondrial DNA in S. cerevisiae. This, and the direct measure of the mitochondrial DNA gene complement confirms that irreversible damage of the mitochondrial DNA occurred in both mutant strains and is consistent with an essential role of the chimeric Nrg1/Rtg3 regulator in mitochondrial DNA maintenance.",

While circadian periods have been shown to correlate with entrainment phases, and clock amplitude influences the phase response of an oscillator to pulse-like zeitgeber signals, the co-modulations of amplitude and periods, which we term twist, have not been studied in detail. In this paper we define two concepts: parametric twist refers to amplitude-period correlations arising in ensembles of self-sustained clocks in the absence of external inputs, and phase space twist refers to the co-modulation of an individual clocks amplitude and period in response to external zeitgebers. Our findings show that twist influences the interaction of oscillators with the environment, facilitating entrainment, fastening recovery to pulse-like perturbations or modifying the response of an individual clock to coupling. This theoretical framework might be applied to understand the emerging properties of other oscillating systems.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, genomic imprinting results from different sets of epigenetic marks that distinguish the parental origins of loci in the progeny. Epigenetic reprogramming of genomic imprinting is necessary to establish a totipotent cell state. The consecutive erasure of parental epigenetic marks and the deposition of new marks occurs alongside major life stage transitions including gametogenesis and fertilization. However, despite occurring concomitantly with gametogenesis, the role of meiosis in epigenetic reprogramming has received little attention. To address this question, we use the model bryophyte Marchantia polymorpha. Following the haploid reproductive phase of this land plant, the expression of the paternal genome is silenced by the histone modification H3K27me3 in the short-lived diploid embryo. We show that imprinting is erased during meiosis, which occurs separately from gametogenesis and fertilization in Marchantia. The epigenetic reprogramming initiated during meiosis is completed in the meiotic spores where the chromatin landscape of the next haploid generation is established de novo. Hence, our findings illustrate a potential role for meiosis in epigenetic reprogramming that may be generalized to other sexually reproducing species.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is an important contributor to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that is the most common morbidity in very preterm infants. Mitochondrial functional differences due to inherited and acquired mutations influence the pathogenesis of disorders in which oxidative stress plays a critical role. We previously showed using mitochondrial-nuclear exchange (MNX) mice that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variations modulate hyperoxia-induced lung injury severity in a model of BPD. In this study, we studied the effects of mtDNA variations on mitochondrial function including mitophagy in alveolar epithelial cells (AT2) from MNX mice. We also investigated oxidant and inflammatory stress as well as transcriptomic profiles in lung tissue in mice and expression of proteins such as PINK1, Parkin and SIRT3 in infants with BPD. Our results indicate that AT2 from mice with C57 mtDNA had decreased mitochondrial bioenergetic function and inner membrane potential, increased mitochondrial membrane permeability and were exposed to higher levels of oxidant stress during hyperoxia compared to AT2 from mice with C3H mtDNA. Lungs from hyperoxia-exposed mice with C57 mtDNA also had higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to lungs from mice with C3H mtDNA. We also noted changes in KEGG pathways related to inflammation, PPAR and glutamatergic signaling, and mitophagy in mice with certain mito-nuclear combinations but not others. Mitophagy was decreased by hyperoxia in all mice strains, but to a greater degree in AT2 and neonatal mice lung fibroblasts from hyperoxia-exposed mice with C57 mtDNA compared to C3H mtDNA. Finally, mtDNA haplogroups vary with ethnicity, and Black infants with BPD had lower levels of PINK1, Parkin and SIRT3 expression in HUVEC at birth and tracheal aspirates at 28 days of life when compared to White infants with BPD. These results indicate that predisposition to neonatal lung injury may be modulated by variations in mtDNA and mito-nuclear interactions need to be investigated to discover novel pathogenic mechanisms for BPD.",

    "abstract": "Auanema freiburgense is a trioecious nematode with co-existing males, females, and selfing hermaphrodites. Crosses of XO males with XX females result in a low percentage of XO sons due to the elimination of the nullo-X spermatids by the fathers. This process yields most viable sperm containing an X chromosome, leading to a higher transmission probability of the X chromosome compared to expected transmission via random segregation. The mechanism underlying this process involves the asymmetric distribution of essential cellular organelles during sperm formation, which likely depends on the X chromosome. Specifically, sperm components segregate with the X chromosome daughter cell, while other components are discarded in the nullo-X daughter cell. Here we found that intercrossing two strains of A. freiburgense results in lines in which males produce viable nullo-X sperm. Thus, crosses of those hybrid males with females result in a high percentage of sons. To uncover the genetic basis of nullo-spermatid elimination and X-chromosome drive, we generated a genome assembly for A. freiburgense and genotyped the intercrossed lines. We identified a QTL encompassing several genes on the X chromosome that are associated with its non-Mendelian inheritance observed in A. freiburgense. This finding provides valuable clues to the underlying factors involved in asymmetric organelle partitioning during male meiotic division and thus non-Mendelian transmission of the X chromosome and sex ratios.",

To begin to address this knowledge gap in an unbiased manner, we carried out mRNA display screens against a bromodomain - the N-terminal bromodomain of BRD3 - using peptide libraries that contained either one or two acetyllysine residues. We discovered peptides with very strong consensus sequences and with affinities that are significantly higher than typical bromodomain-peptide interactions. X-ray crystal structures also revealed modes of binding that have not been seen with natural ligands.

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS) can unlock crucial insights into the intricate world of glycosylation analysis. Despite its immense potential, the qualitative and quantitative analysis of isobaric glycopeptide structures remains one of the most daunting hurdles in the field of glycoproteomics. The ability to distinguish between these complex glycan structures poses a significant challenge, hindering our ability to accurately measure and understand the role of glycoproteins in biological systems. A few recent publications described the use of collision energy (CE) modulation to improve structural elucidation, especially for qualitative purposes. Different linkages of glycan units usually demonstrate different stabilities under CID/HCD fragmentation conditions. Fragmentation of the glycan moiety produces low molecular weight ions (oxonium ions) that can serve as a structure-specific signature for specific glycan moieties, however, specificity of these fragments has never been examined closely. Here, we investigated fragmentation specificity using synthetic stable isotope-labelled glycopeptide standards. These standards were isotopically labelled at the reducing terminal GlcNAc, which allowed us to resolve fragments produced by oligomannose core moiety and fragments generated from outer antennary structures. Our research identified the potential for false positive structure assignments due to the occurrence of \"Ghost\" fragments resulting from single glyco unit rearrangement or mannose core fragmentation within the collision cell. To mitigate this issue, we have established a minimal intensity threshold for these fragments to prevent the misidentification of structure-specific fragments in glycoproteomics analysis. Our findings provide a crucial step forward in the quest for more accurate and reliable glycoproteomics measurements.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=142 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/541150v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a5bb21org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a09b5aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@137504borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@78831e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Several strains in the Pseudomonas genus are categorized as plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). Although several of these strains are strong candidates for applications as biofertilizers or biopesticides, known genome editing approaches are generally limited and require further development. Editing genomes in PGPR could enable more robust agricultural applications, persistence and biosafety measures. In this study, we investigate the use of five phage-encoded recombinases to develop a recombineering workflow in 3 PGPR strains: P. protegens Pf-5, P. protegens CHA0, and P. putida KT2440. Using point mutations in the rpoB gene, we reach maximum recombineering efficiencies of 1.5 x 10-4, 3 x 10-4, and 5 x 10-5, respectively, in these strains using {lambda}-Red Beta recombinase from E. coli. We further examine recombineering efficiencies across these strains as a function of selected mutation, editing template concentration, and phosphorothiolate bond protection. This work validates the use of these tools across several environmentally and biotechnologically relevant strains to expand the possibilities of genetic manipulation in the Pseudomonas genus.\n\nImportanceThe Pseudomonas genus contains many members currently being investigated for applications in biodegradation, biopesticides, biocontrol and synthetic biology. Though several strains have been identified with beneficial properties, in situ genetic manipulations to further improve these strains for commercial applications have been limited due to lack of efficient genetic tools that have been tested across this genus. Here we test the recombineering efficiencies of 5 phage-derived recombinases across 3 biotechnologically relevant Pseudomonas strains: P. putida KT2440, P. protegens Pf-5, and P. protegens CHA0. These results demonstrate a method to generate targeted mutations quickly and efficiently across these strains, ideally introducing a method that can be implemented across the Pseudomonas genus and a strategy that may be applied to develop analogous systems in other non-model bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are gaining ground as next-generation drug delivery modalities. Genetic fusion of the protein of interest to a scaffold protein with high EV-sorting ability represents a robust cargo loading strategy. To address the paucity of such scaffold proteins we conducted a large-scale comparative study involving 244 candidate proteins. Their EV-sorting potential was evaluated using a simple but reliable assay that can distinguish intravesicular cargo proteins from surface and non-vesicular proteins. Notably, 24 proteins with conserved EV-sorting abilities across five types of producer cells were identified. Most of these are first to be reported including TSPAN2 and TSPAN3, which emerged as lead candidates, outperforming the well-known CD63 scaffold. Importantly, these engineered EVs show promise as delivery vehicles as demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo internalization studies with luminal cargo proteins as well as surface display of functional domains. The discovery of these novel scaffolds provides a new platform for EV-based engineering.",

    "abstract": "In rats, eating obesogenic diets increase calcium-permeable AMPA receptor (CP-AMPAR) transmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core, and enhances food-motivated behavior. Interestingly these diet-induced alterations in NAc transmission are pronounced in obesity-prone (OP) rats and absent in obesity-resistant (OR) populations. However, effects of diet manipulation on food motivation, and the mechanisms underlying NAc plasticity in OPs is unknown. Using male selectively-bred OP and OR rats, we assessed food-motivated behavior following ad lib access to chow (CH), junk-food (JF), or 10d of JF followed by a return to chow diet (JF-Dep). Behavioral tests included conditioned reinforcement, instrumental responding, and free consumption. Additionally, optogenetic, chemogenetic, and pharmacological approaches were used to examine NAc CP-AMPAR recruitment following diet manipulation and ex vivo treatment of brain slices. Motivation for food was greater in OP than OR rats, as expected. However, JF-Dep only produced enhancements in food-seeking in OP groups, while continuous JF access reduced food-seeking in both OPs and ORs. Reducing excitatory transmission in the NAc was sufficient to recruit CP-AMPARs to synapses in OPs, but not ORs. In OPs, JF-induced increases in CP-AMPARs occurred in mPFC-, but not BLA-to-NAc inputs. Diet differentially affects behavioral and neural plasticity in obesity susceptible populations. We also identify conditions for acute recruitment of NAc CP-AMPARs; these results suggest that synaptic scaling mechanisms contribute to NAc CP-AMPAR recruitment. Overall, this work improves our understanding of how sugary, fatty food consumption interacts with obesity susceptibility to influence food-motivated behavior. It also extends our fundamental understanding of NAc CP-AMPAR recruitment; this has important implications for motivation in the context of obesity as well as drug addiction.",

    "abstract": "Early screening to determine patient risk of developing Alzheimers will allow better interventions and planning but necessitates accessible methods such as behavioral biomarkers. Previously, we showed that cognitively healthy older individuals whose cerebrospinal fluid amyloid / tau ratio indicates high risk of cognitive decline experienced implicit interference during a high-effort task, signaling early changes in attention. To further investigate attentions effect on implicit interference, we analyzed two experiments completed sequentially by the same high- and low-risk individuals. We hypothesized that if attention modulates interference, practice would affect the influence of implicit distractors. Indeed, while both groups experienced a strong practice effect, the association between practice and interference effects diverged between groups: stronger practice effects correlated with more implicit interference in high-risk participants, but less interference in low-risk individuals. Furthermore, low-risk individuals showed a positive correlation between implicit interference and EEG low-range alpha event-related desynchronization when switching from high-to low-load tasks. These results demonstrate how attention impacts implicit interference and highlight early differences in cognition between high- and low-risk individuals.",

    "abstract": "All brain areas affected in Parkinsons disease (PD) show an abundance of microglia with an activated morphology together with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that neuroinflammation may contribute to the neurodegenerative process in this common and incurable disorder. We applied a single nucleus RNA- and ATAC-sequencing approach using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform to postmortem PD samples to investigate microglial heterogeneity in PD. We created a multiomic dataset using substantia nigra (SN) tissues from 19 PD donors and 14 non-PD controls (NPCs), as well as three other brain regions from the PD donors which are differentially affected in this disease: the ventral tegmental area (VTA), substantia inominata (SI), and hypothalamus (HypoTs). We identified thirteen microglial subpopulations within these tissues as well as a perivascular macrophage and a monocyte population, of which we characterized the transcriptional and chromatin repertoires. Using this data, we investigated whether these microglial subpopulations have any association with PD and whether they have regional specificity. We uncovered several changes in microglial subpopulations in PD, which appear to parallel the magnitude of neurodegeneration across these four selected brain regions. Specifically, we identified that inflammatory microglia in PD are more prevalent in the SN and differentially express PD-associated markers. Our analysis revealed the depletion of a CD83 and HIF1A-expressing microglial subpopulation, specifically in the SN in PD, that has a unique chromatin signature compared to other microglial subpopulations. Interestingly, this microglial subpopulation has regional specificity to the brainstem in non-disease tissues. Furthermore, it is highly enriched for transcripts of proteins involved in antigen presentation and heat-shock proteins, and its depletion in the PD SN may have implications for neuronal vulnerability in disease.",

    "abstract": "Lewy pathology composed of -synuclein is the key pathological hallmark of Parkinsons disease (PD), found both in dopaminergic neurons that control motor function, and throughout cortical regions that control cognitive function. Recent work has investigated which dopaminergic neurons are most susceptible to death, but little is known about which neurons are vulnerable to developing Lewy pathology and what molecular changes an aggregate induces. In the current study, we use spatial transcriptomics to selectively capture whole transcriptome signatures from cortical neurons with Lewy pathology compared to those without pathology in the same brains. We find, both in PD and in a mouse model of PD, that there are specific classes of excitatory neurons that are vulnerable to developing Lewy pathology in the cortex. Further, we identify conserved gene expression changes in aggregate-bearing neurons that we designate the Lewy-associated molecular dysfunction from aggregates (LAMDA) signature. This gene signature indicates that neurons with aggregates downregulate synaptic, mitochondrial, ubiquitin-proteasome, endo-lysosomal, and cytoskeletal genes and upregulate DNA repair and complement/cytokine genes. However, beyond DNA repair gene upregulation, we find that neurons also activate apoptotic pathways, suggesting that if DNA repair fails, neurons undergo programmed cell death. Our results identify neurons vulnerable to Lewy pathology in the PD cortex and identify a conserved signature of molecular dysfunction in both mice and humans.",

    "abstract": "Increasing global temperatures and unpredictable climatic extremes have contributed to the spread of vector-borne diseases. The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the main vector of multiple arboviruses that negatively impact human health, mostly in low socioeconomic areas of the world. Co-circulation and co-infection of these viruses in humans have been increasingly reported; however, how vectors contribute to this alarming trend remains unclear. Here, we examine single and co-infection of Mayaro virus (-D strain, Alphavirus) and dengue virus (serotype 2, Flavivirus) in Ae. aegypti adults and cell lines at two constant temperatures, moderate (27{degrees}C) and hot (32{degrees}C), to quantify vector competence and the effect of temperature on infection, dissemination and transmission, including on the degree of interaction between the two viruses. Both viruses were primarily affected by temperature but there was a partial interaction with co-infection. Dengue virus quickly replicates in adult mosquitoes, with a tendency for higher titers in co-infected mosquitoes at both temperatures and mosquito mortality was more severe at higher temperatures in all conditions. For dengue, and to a lesser extent Mayaro, vector competence and vectorial capacity were higher at hotter temperature in co- vs single infections and was more evident at earlier timepoints (7 vs 14 days post infection). The temperature-dependent phenotype was confirmed in vitro by faster cellular infection and initial replication at higher temperatures for dengue but not for Mayaro virus. Our study suggests that contrasting kinetics of the two viruses could be related to their intrinsic thermal requirements, where alphaviruses thrive better at lower temperatures compared to flaviviruses, but further studies are necessary to clarify the role of co-infection at different and variable temperature regimes.\n\nAuthor summaryGlobal warming is having devastating consequences for the environment, and a cause of concern is the increase in local abundance and geographic range of mosquitoes and the associated viruses they transmit. This study explores how temperature affects the mosquitos ability to survive and potentially spread two viruses, Mayaro and dengue, in single or co-infections. We found that Mayaro virus was not clearly affected by temperature or the presence of dengue infection. In contrast, dengue virus showed higher infection and potential for higher transmission in mosquitoes kept at high temperatures, and this trend was stronger in co-infections compared to single infections. Mosquito survival consistently decreased at high temperatures. We hypothesize the differences observed for dengue virus are due to the faster growth and viral activity in the mosquito at hotter temperatures, a pattern not observed for Mayaro virus. More studies under different temperature regimes are needed to clarify the role of co-infection.",

    "abstract": "In the Pseduomonadacea family, the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor AlgU is crucial to withstand adverse conditions. Azotobacter vinelandii, a closed relative of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been a model for cellular differentiation in Gram-negative bacteria since it forms desiccation-resistant cysts. Previous work demonstrated the essential role of AlgU to withstand oxidative stress and on A. vinelandii differentiation, particularly for the positive control of alginate production. In this study, the AlgU regulon was dissected by a proteomic approach under vegetative growing conditions and upon encystment induction. Our results revealed several molecular targets that explained the requirement of this sigma factor during oxidative stress and extended its role in alginate production. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AlgU was necessary to produce alkyl resorcinols, a type of aromatic lipids that conform the cell membrane of the differentiated cell. AlgU was also found to positively regulate stress resistance proteins such as OsmC, LEA-1, or proteins involved in trehalose synthesis. A position-specific scoring-matrix (PSSM) was generated based on the consensus sequence recognized by AlgU in P. aeruginosa, which allowed the identification of direct AlgU targets in the A. vinelandii genome. This work further expands our knowledge about the function of the ECF sigma factor AlgU in A. vinelandii and contributes to explains its key regulatory role under adverse conditions.",

Bacteriophage are highly specific to their bacterial host species and so we hypothesize that phage populations would mirror those of bacterial pathogens within infected tissues. To test this, here we study publicly-available cell-free DNA generated using next generation sequencing of infected bodily fluids, including urine, joint fluid, peritoneal fluid, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, and abscess fluid as well as uninfected control samples. These were analyzed using a computational pipeline for identifying bacteriophage sequences in cfDNA.

Additionally, phages from E. coli, Streptococcus, and S. aureus are overrepresented both in terms of proportion and diversity in fluids infected with these same pathogens. These data indicate that phages reflect the relative abundance of their bacterial hosts at sites of infection.

Whereas most organisms grow exponentially at the single-cell level, we find that Mtb exhibits a unique linear growth mode. Mtb growth characteristics are highly variable from cell-to-cell, notably in their growth speeds, cell cycle timing, and cell sizes. Together, our study demonstrates that growth behavior of Mtb diverges from what we have learned from model bacteria.

    "abstract": "The global increase of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health concern. An effective AMR surveillance tool is needed to track the emergence and spread of AMR. Wastewater surveillance has been proposed as a resource-efficient tool for monitoring AMR carriage in the community. Here, we performed genomic surveillance of antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli obtained from fecal sludge and sewage in Uganda to gain insights into E. coli epidemiology and AMR burden in the underlying population. Selective media containing different antibiotic combinations (cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime + ciprofloxacin + gentamicin) were used to obtain antimicrobial-resistant E. coli from fecal sludge and sewage. Short-read sequencing was performed for the obtained isolates, and a subset of isolates (selected from predominant sequence types (STs)) was also subjected to long-read sequencing. Genomic analysis of the obtained E. coli isolates (n = 181) revealed the prevalence of ST10 complex, including ST167 (n = 43), ST10 (n = 28), ST1284 (n = 17), and ST617 (n = 4), in both fecal sludge and sewage, irrespective of antibiotics used for selection. We also detected global high-risk clones ST1193 (n = 10) and ST131 (n = 2 clade A, n = 3 subclade C1-M27, and n = 1 subclade C2). Diverse AMR determinants, including extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase genes (mostly blaCTX-M-15) and mutations in gyrA and parC, were identified. Analysis of the completed genomes revealed that diverse IncF plasmids and chromosomal integration were the major contributors to the spread of AMR genes in the predominant STs. This study showed that a combination of sewage surveillance (or fecal sludge surveillance) and whole-genome sequencing can be a powerful tool for monitoring AMR carriage in the underlying population.",

L1 replicates in early embryos, causing genetic diversity and defects, but can be active in some somatic stem cells, tumors and during aging. L1 encodes two proteins essential for retrotransposition: ORF2, a replicase, and ORF1, a coiled coil mediated homo trimer, which functions as a nucleic acid chaperone. Both proteins contain highly conserved domains and preferentially bind their encoding transcript to form an L1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP), which mediates retrotransposition. However, the coiled coil has undergone episodes of substantial amino acid replacement to the extent that a given L1 family can concurrently express multiple ORF1s that differ in the sequence of their coiled coils. Here we show that such distinct ORF1p sequences can become entangled forming heterotrimers when co-expressed from separate vectors.",

    "abstract": "The VirB protein, encoded by the large virulence plasmid of Shigella spp., is a key transcriptional regulator of virulence genes. Without a functional virB gene, Shigella cells are avirulent. On the virulence plasmid, VirB functions to offset transcriptional silencing mediated by the nucleoid structuring protein, H-NS, which binds and sequesters AT-rich DNA, making it inaccessible for gene expression. Thus, gaining a mechanistic understanding of how VirB counters H-NS-mediated silencing is of considerable interest. VirB is unusual in that it does not resemble classic transcription factors. Instead, its closest relatives are found in the ParB superfamily, where the best-characterized members function in faithful DNA segregation before cell division. Here, we show that VirB is a fast-evolving member of this superfamily and report for the first time that the VirB protein binds a highly unusual ligand, CTP. VirB binds this nucleoside triphosphate preferentially and with specificity. Based on alignments with the best-characterized members of the ParB family, we identify amino acids of VirB likely to bind CTP. Substitutions in these residues disrupt several well-documented activities of VirB, including its anti-silencing activity at a VirB-dependent promoter, its role in generating a Congo red positive phenotype in Shigella, and the ability of the VirB protein to form foci in the bacterial cytoplasm when fused to GFP. Thus, this work is the first to show that VirB is a bona fide CTP-binding protein and links Shigella virulence phenotypes to the nucleoside triphosphate, CTP.\n\nImportanceShigella species cause bacillary dysentery (shigellosis), the second leading cause of diarrheal deaths worldwide. With growing antibiotic resistance, there is a pressing need to identify novel molecular drug targets. Shigella virulence phenotypes are controlled by the transcriptional regulator, VirB. We show that VirB belongs to a fast-evolving, primarily plasmid-borne clade of the ParB superfamily, which has diverged from versions that have a distinct cellular role - DNA partitioning. We are the first to report that, like classic members of the ParB family, VirB binds a highly unusual ligand, CTP. Mutants predicted to be defective in CTP binding are compromised in a variety of virulence attributes controlled by VirB. This study i) reveals that VirB binds CTP, ii) provides a link between VirB-CTP interactions and Shigella virulence phenotypes, and iii) broadens our understanding of the ParB superfamily, a group of bacterial proteins that play critical roles in many different bacteria.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDrug-resistant TB (DR-TB) poses a major global challenge to public health and therapeutics. It is an emerging global concern associated with increased morbidity and mortality mostly seen in the low- and middle-income countries. Lack of adequate diagnostic equipment for detection and monitoring of DR-TB leads to delayed diagnosis and subsequent inappropriate treatment. TB drug resistance testing has relied on phenotypic presentations in drug sensitivity testing (DST). The cost of setting up a TB phenotypic testing facility is prohibitive for most healthcare facilities due to its intensive investment in infrastructure, equipment, laboratory consumables, and personnel.\n\nMolecular techniques are highly sensitive and offer timely and accurate results for TB drug resistance testing, thereby positively influencing patient management plan. The commonly used assay for detection of rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) is GenoType MTBDRplus. Although the GenoType MTBDRplus is more inexpensive and accurate than DST, when compared to other molecular techniques, it requires more specialized expertise, more hands-on time, substantial laboratory infrastructure and result interpretation is subjective to user. The FluoroCycler(R) MTBDR is a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay that detects M.tb and at the same time identifies mutations in rpoB, katG and inhA genes that are associated with RIF and INH resistance. It can detect up to 45 mutations in these genes in a single tube, producing results within 2.5 hours and this ability is only comparable to sequencing.\n\nMethodsThe study was carried out at the National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory (NTRL) in Kenya in the period between January to October 2022. A total of 243 M.tb clinical isolates were included in the study. These isolates comprised of 50 isolates with mutations in rpoB, 51 isolates with katG mutations, 51 isolates with mutations in inhA. and 91 M.tb isolates lacking mutations in these genes based on Genotype MTBDRplus results. DNA from the isolates was extracted using the FluoroLyse extraction kit. Real-time PCR targeting the rpoB, InhA, and katG genes was performed using the FluoroType MTBDR amplification mix. Isolates with discordant results between Genotype MTBDRplus and FluoroCycler(R) MTBDR assays underwent targeted sequencing for the respective genes, then sequences were analyzed for mutations using Geneious version 11.0 software.\n\nResultsThe sensitivity of the Fluorocycler XT MTBDR assay for detection of mutations that confer drug resistance was 86% (95% CI 73.0,94.0) for rpoB, 96% (95% CI 87, 100) for katG and 92% (95% CI 81, 98) for inhA. The assays specificity was 97% (95% CI 93, 99) for rpoB, 98% (95% CI 96, 100) for katG and 97% (95% CI 93, 99) for inhA. Discrepancy between Genotype MTBDRplus and FluoroType MTBDR results were observed in 28 (11.5%) isolates with rpoB, katG and inhA genes having 26% (13/50), 10% (5/50), and 20% (10/50) isolates with discrepant results respectively. Sequencing results that were in agreement with FluoroType MTBDR results were 77% (10/13) for rpoB, 80% (4/5) for katG, and 70% (7/10) for inhA compared to 23% (3/13), 20% (1/5), and 30% (3/10) for Genotype MTBDRplus assay\n\nConclusionThe diagnostic accuracy of FluoroType MTBDR for the detection of mutations conferring resistance to RIF and INH was high compared with that of Genotype MTBDRplus, and demonstrates its suitability as a replacement assay for Genotype MTBDRplus.",

    "abstract": "Processive enzymes, such as polymerases or ribosomes, are often studied in en-semble or bulk experiments through the monitoring of time-dependent signals, such as fluorescence time traces. However, ensemble signals are a superposition of the time traces of all molecules in the reaction and can exhibit less distinct features than individual single-molecule signals due to the stochasticity of biomolecular processes. Here, we demonstrate that under certain conditions, bulk signals from processive reactions can still be decomposed to reveal hidden information about individual reaction steps. Using mRNA translation as a case study for processive biochemical reactions, we explore the limits of least-squares approaches for ensemble fluorescence signal decomposition. Specifically, we show that decomposing a noisy ensemble signal generated by the translation of mRNAs containing more than a few codons represents an ill-posed problem, which can be addressed through Tikhonov regularization. Our findings can help to increase the information content extracted from bulk experiments, thereby expanding the range of these time- and cost-efficient methods.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant advances in reconstructing genome-scale metabolic networks, the understanding of cellular metabolism remains incomplete for many organisms. A promising approach for elucidating cellular metabolism is analysing the full scope of enzyme promiscuity, which exploits the capacity of enzymes to bind to non-annotated substrates and generate novel reactions. To guide time-consuming costly experimentation, different computational methods have been proposed for exploring enzyme promiscuity. One relevant algorithm is PROXIMAL, which strongly relies on KEGG to define generic reaction rules and link specific molecular substructures with associated chemical transformations. Here, we present a completely new pipeline, PROXIMAL2, which overcomes the dependency on KEGG data. In addition, PROXIMAL2 introduces two relevant improvements with respect to the former version: i) correct treatment of multi-step reactions and ii) tracking of electric charges in the transformations. We compare PROXIMAL and PROXIMAL2 in recovering annotated products from substrates in KEGG reactions, finding a highly significant improvement in the level of accuracy. We then applied PROXIMAL2 to predict degradation reactions of phenolic compounds in the human gut microbiota. The results were compared to RetroPath RL, a different and relevant enzyme promiscuity method. We found a significant overlap between these two methods but also complementary results, which open new research directions into this relevant question in nutrition.",

    "abstract": "Papain-like protease (PLpro) is a viral protease found in some coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Inhibition of PLpro activity could potentially limit viral replication, making it an attractive target for antiviral drug development. This work describes the discovery of novel allosteric residues of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro that can be targeted with antiviral drugs. First, a computational analysis was performed to identify potential druggable pockets on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. The computational analysis predicted three druggable pockets around PLpros surface and are located at the interfaces of its four domains. Pocket 1 is located at the interface between the Ub1 and thumb domains, pocket 2 is at the interface between the thumb, finger, and palm domains, and pocket 3 is at the interface between the finger and palm domains. Targeted alanine mutagenesis of selected residues with important structural interactions revealed 14 residues that are essential for maintaining a catalytically active and thermodynamically stable PLpro. Namely, these residues are T10, D12, T54, Y72, and Y83 in pocket 1; Q122, S239, Q237, H275, and S278 in pocket 2; and S212, Y213, Y251, K254, and Y305, in pocket 3. In addition to this, residues that were found important to catalysis were recovered by mutating them to amino acids of similar physicochemical properties to further elucidate the mechanistic properties of the local interactions they make. Experimental work confirms essential contacts are present in the allosteric sites of PLpro that could be targeted with non-competitive inhibitors as novel therapeutics against COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionWe encode the visual world retinotopically, imposing a spatial code on visual information processing1-4. However, models of brain organization generally assume that retinotopic coding is replaced by abstract, amodal coding as information propagates through the visual hierarchy5,6 towards memory structures7-12. This view raises a puzzle for constructive accounts of visual memory: how can mnemonic and visual information interact effectively in the brain if they are represented using fundamentally different neural codes13? Recent work has suggested that even high-level cortical areas, including the default mode network, exhibit retinotopic coding: they contain visually evoked population receptive fields (pRFs) with inverted response amplitudes14,15. But, the functional relevance of this retinotopic coding at the cortical apex remains unclear. Here, we report that retinotopic coding at the cortical apex structures interactions between mnemonic and perceptual areas in the brain. Using fine-grained, individual participant functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show that just beyond the anterior edge of category-selective visual cortex, category-selective memory areas exhibit a robust, inverted retinotopic code. The negative and positive pRF populations in mnemonic and perceptual areas, respectively, have closely matched visual field representations, reflecting their tight functional coupling. Moreover, the +/- pRFs in perceptual and mnemonic cortex exhibit spatially-specific opponent responses during both bottom-up visual processing and top-down memory recall, suggesting that these areas are interlocked in a mutually-inhibitory dynamic. This spatially-specific opponency further generalizes to familiar scene perception, a task that requires mnemonic-perceptual interplay. Together, these results show that retinotopic coding structures interactions between perceptual and mnemonic systems in the brain, thereby scaffolding their dynamic interaction.",

    "abstract": "Neuropeptides play key roles in shaping the organization and function of neuronal circuits. In the inferior colliculus (IC), which is located in the auditory midbrain, Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is expressed by a large class of GABAergic neurons that project locally as well as outside the IC. The IC integrates information from numerous auditory nuclei making the IC an important hub for sound processing. Most neurons in the IC have local axon collaterals, however the organization and function of local circuits in the IC remains largely unknown. We previously found that neurons in the IC can express the NPY Y1 receptor (Y1R+) and application of the Y1R agonist, [Leu31, Pro34]-NPY (LP-NPY), decreases the excitability of Y1R+ neurons. To investigate how Y1R+ neurons and NPY signaling contribute to local IC networks, we used optogenetics to activate Y1R+ neurons while recording from other neurons in the ipsilateral IC. Here, we show that 78.4% of glutamatergic neurons in the IC express the Y1 receptor, providing extensive opportunities for NPY signaling to regulate excitation in local IC circuits. Additionally, Y1R+ neuron synapses exhibit modest short-term synaptic plasticity, suggesting that local excitatory circuits maintain their influence over computations during sustained stimuli. We further found that application of LP-NPY decreases recurrent excitation in the IC, suggesting that NPY signaling strongly regulates local circuit function in the auditory midbrain. Together, our data show that excitatory neurons are highly interconnected in the local IC and their influence over local circuits is tightly regulated by NPY signaling.",

Here, we adopt a hybrid approach, combining the predictive power of ANNs with the interpretability of classic models. We apply this approach to Reinforcement Learning (RL), beginning with classic RL models and replacing their components one-by-one with ANNs. We find that hybrid models can provide similar fit to fully-general ANNs, while retaining the interpretability of classic cognitive models: They reveal reward-based learning mechanisms in humans that are strikingly similar to classic RL. They also reveal mechanisms not contained in classic models, including separate rewardblind mechanisms, and the specific memory contents relevant to reward-based and reward-blind mechanisms.",

Despite advances in rehabilitation care, effective neuroprotective treatments for TBI patients are lacking. Furthermore, current drug delivery methods for TBI treatment are inefficient in targeting inflamed brain areas. To address this issue, we have developed a liposomal nanocarrier (Lipo) encapsulating dexamethasone (Dex), an agonist for the glucocorticoid receptor utilized to alleviate inflammation and swelling in various conditions. In vitro studies show that Lipo-Dex were well tolerated in human and murine neural cells. Lipo-Dex showed significant suppression of inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-, release after induction of neural inflammation with lipopolysaccharide. Further, the Lipo-Dex were administered to young adult male and female C57BL/6 mice immediately after a controlled cortical impact injury. Our findings demonstrate that Lipo-Dex can selectively target the injured brain, thereby reducing lesion volume, cell death, astrogliosis, the release of proinflammatory cytokines, and microglial activation compared to Lipo-treated mice in a sex-dependent manner, showing a major impact only in male mice. This highlights the importance of considering sex as a crucial variable in developing and evaluating new nano-therapies for brain injury. These results suggest that Lipo-Dex administration may effectively treat acute TBI.",

Though many systems for bioproduct production are well documented and tested in model organisms, it is essential to look beyond to non-model organisms to expand the field and take advantage of metabolically versatile strains. This investigation centers on Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE-1, a purple, non-sulfur autotrophic, and anaerobic bacterium capable of producing bioproducts that are comparable to their petroleum-based counterparts. To induce bioplastic overproduction, genes that might have a potential role in the PHB biosynthesis such as the regulator, phaR, and phaZ known for its ability to degrade PHB granules were deleted using markerless deletion. Mutants in pathways that might compete with polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production such as glycogen and nitrogen fixation previously created to increase n-butanol production by TIE-1 were also tested. In addition, a phage integration system was developed to insert RuBisCO (RuBisCO form I and II genes) driven by a constitutive promoter PaphII into TIE- 1 genome. Our results show that deletion of the phaR gene of the PHB pathway increases PHB productivity when TIE-1 was grown photoheterotrophically with butyrate and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl). Mutants unable to make glycogen or fix dinitrogen gas show an increase in PHB productivity under photoautotrophic growth conditions with hydrogen. In addition, the engineered TIE-1 overexpressing RuBisCO form I and form II produces significantly more polyhydroxybutyrate than the wild type under photoheterotrophy with butyrate and photoautotrophy with hydrogen. Inserting RuBisCO genes into TIE-1 genome is a more effective strategy than deleting competitive pathways to increase PHB production in TIE-1. The phage integration system developed for TIE-1 thus creates numerous opportunities for synthetic biology in TIE-1.",

Mosquito species were identified by qRT-PCR or Sanger sequencing, the presence of infectious virus in mosquitoes was confirmed by plaque assays, and viral genome copies were quantified by qRT-PCR. We found that Culex pipiens pipiens were able to transmit WNV (11% IR, 40% DR, 100% TR) but not USUV (EU lineage: 13% IR, 0% DR; AF lineage: 16% IR, 17% DR, 0% TR). In contrast, Culex modestus was able to transmit USUV (AF lineage: 60% IR, 67% DR, 50% TR), but not WNV (0% IR). We found that the presence or absence of Wolbachia was species-dependent and did not associate with virus transmission.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThis is the first report that Belgian Culex mosquitoes can transmit both WNV and USUV, forewarning the risk of human transmission. More research is needed to understand the potential influence of Wolbachia on arbovirus transmission in Culex modestus mosquitoes.\n\nAuthor SummaryWest Nile virus and Usutu virus can cause seasonal epidemics in humans. They are maintained in a transmission cycle between wild birds and Culex mosquitoes, and humans that are bitten by infected mosquitoes can develop life-threatening neurological disease. Certain Culex species carry the symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia which can block virus transmission in mosquitoes. In Belgium, it is currently unknown which Culex species can transmit West Nile virus and/or Usutu virus, or if they carry Wolbachia bacteria. In our study, we captured wild mosquitoes from Belgium and infected them with West Nile virus or Usutu virus. We found that a common European species (Culex pipiens pipiens, the Northern House mosquito) could transmit West Nile virus, whereas a lesser known species (Culex modestus) could transmit Usutu virus. Wolbachia bacteria could be found in almost all Culex pipiens pipiens, but not in Culex modestus, suggesting that Wolbachia prevalence is species-specific. More research is needed to understand if Wolbachia can block virus transmission in Culex modestus. This is the first report on the ability of Culex mosquitoes to transmit West Nile virus and Usutu virus in Belgium, forewarning the risk of transmission to humans.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionarily conserved circadian system allows organisms to synchronize internal processes with 24-h cycling environmental timing cues, ensuring optimal adaptation. Like other organs, the pancreas function is under circadian control. Recent evidence suggests that aging by itself is associated with altered circadian homeostasis in different tissues which could affect the organs resiliency to aging-related pathologies. Pancreas pathologies of either endocrine or exocrine components are age-related. Whether pancreas circadian transcriptome output is affected by age is still unknown. To address this, here we profiled the impact of age on the pancreatic transcriptome over a full circadian cycle and elucidated a circadian transcriptome reorganization of pancreas by aging. Our study highlights gain of rhythms in the extrinsic cellular pathways in the aged pancreas and extends a potential role to fibroblast-associated mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Vaccines have been central in ending the COVID-19 pandemic, but newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants increasingly escape first-generation vaccine protection. To fill this gap, live particle-based vaccines mimicking natural infection aim at protecting against a broader spectrum of virus variants. We designed \"single-cycle SARS-CoV-2 viruses\" (SCVs) that lack essential viral genes, possess superior immune-modulatory features and provide an excellent safety profile in the Syrian hamster model. Full protection of all intranasally vaccinated animals was achieved against an autologous challenge with SARS-CoV-2 virus using an Envelope-gene-deleted vaccine candidate. By deleting key immune-downregulating genes, sterilizing immunity was achieved with an advanced candidate without virus spread to contact animals. Hence, SCVs have the potential to induce a broad and durable protection against COVID-19 superior to a natural infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHepatic knockdown of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene or the angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) gene has been demonstrated to reduce blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, and hepatic knockdown of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene has been demonstrated to reduce blood pressure. Genome editing can productively target each of these three genes in hepatocytes in the liver, offering the possibility of durable \"one-and-done\" therapies for hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. However, concerns around making permanent gene sequence changes via DNA strand breaks might hinder acceptance of these therapies. Epigenome editing offers an alternative approach to gene inactivation, via silencing of gene expression by methylation of the promoter region, but the long-term durability of epigenome editing remains to be established.\n\nMethodsWe assessed the ability of epigenome editing to durably reduce the expression of the human PCSK9, ANGPTL3, and AGT genes in HuH-7 hepatoma cells. Using the CRISPRoff epigenome editor, we identified guide RNAs that produced efficient gene knockdown immediately after transfection. We assessed the durability of gene expression and methylation changes through serial cell passages.\n\nResultsCells treated with CRISPRoff and PCSK9 guide RNAs were maintained for up to 124 cell doublings and demonstrated durable knockdown of gene expression and increased CpG dinucleotide methylation in the promoter, exon 1, and intron 1 regions. In contrast, cells treated with CRISPRoff and ANGPTL3 guide RNAs experienced only transient knockdown of gene expression. Cells treated with CRISPRoff and AGT guide RNAs also experienced transient knockdown of gene expression; although initially there was increased CpG methylation throughout the early part of the gene, this methylation was geographically heterogeneous--transient in the promoter, and stable in intron 1.\n\nConclusionsThis work demonstrates precise and durable gene regulation via methylation, supporting a new therapeutic approach for protection against cardiovascular disease via knockdown of genes such as PCSK9. However, the durability of knockdown with methylation changes is not generalizable across target genes, likely limiting the therapeutic potential of epigenome editing compared to other modalities.",

    "abstract": "Invasive ants, such as Linepithema humile (the Argentine ant), pose a global threat, necessitating a better understanding of their behaviour in order to improve management strategies. Traditional eradication methods, including baiting, have had limited success, but the causes of control failure are not always clear. Here we propose that ants may learn to avoid toxic baits in part due to their association with ant corpses. Ants were tested on a Y-maze after exposure to scented corpses or dummies. 69% (n = 64) of ants avoided branches bearing the scent of scented corpses. At a collective level, colonies neglected food sources associated with scented ant corpses in favour of a food source with a novel odour, with only 42% (n = 273) of foragers feeding from the corpse-scent associated food source. However, if corpses were produced by feeding ants scented toxicant, focal ants encountering these corpses did not avoid the corpse-associated scent on a Y maze (53%, n = 65). Moreover, in a dual-feeder test, ants did not avoid feeding at food sources scented with an odour associated with conspecific corpses. The study demonstrates that conspecific corpses can act as a negative stimulus for Linepithema humile, leading to avoidance of odours associated with corpses, which can lead to potential avoidance of toxic baits. Why the more realistic Y-maze trial with corpses of ants that had ingested the toxicant elicited no avoidance is unclear: it may be due to weaker odour cues from ingested food, or a counterbalancing of the negative corpse stimulus by the positive presence of food remains on the corpse. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates that conspecific corpses act as a negative stimulus for ants, and this should be kept in mind when planning control efforts. A simple solution to this issue would be adding odours to baits, and cycling baits between treatments. This would disrupt the association between bait odour and corpses.",

    "abstract": "We report here the first occurrence of an adenosine deaminase-related growth factor (ADGF) that deaminates adenosine 5 monophosphate (AMP) in preference to adenosine. The ADGFs are a group of secreted deaminases found throughout the animal kingdom that affect the extracellular concentration of adenosine by converting it to inosine. The AMP deaminase studied here was first isolated and biochemically characterized from the roman snail Helix pomatia in 1983. Determination of the amino acid sequence of the AMP deaminase enabled sequence comparisons to protein databases and revealed it as a member of the ADGF family. Cloning and expression of its cDNA in Pichia pastoris allowed the comparison of the biochemical characteristics of the native and recombinant forms of the enzyme and confirmed they correspond to the previously reported activity. Uncharacteristically, the H. pomatia AMP deaminase was determined to be dissimilar to the AMP deaminase family by sequence comparison while demonstrating similarity to the ADGFs despite having AMP as its preferred substrate rather than adenosine.",
