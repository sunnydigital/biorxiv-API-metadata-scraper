    "abstract": "Searching tandem mass spectrometry proteomics data against a database is a well-established method for assigning peptide sequences to observed spectra but typically cannot identify peptides harboring unexpected post-translational modifications (PTMs). Open modification searching aims to address this problem by allowing a spectrum to match a peptide even if the spectrums precursor mass differs from the peptide mass. However, expanding the search space in this way can lead to a loss in statistical power to detect peptides. We therefore developed a method, called CONGA, that takes into account results from both types of searches--a traditional \"narrow window\" search and an open modification search--while carrying out rigorous false discovery rate (FDR) control. The result is an algorithm that provides the best of both worlds: the ability to detect unexpected PTMs without a concomitant loss of power to detect unmodified peptides.",

    "abstract": "Aortic Smooth Muscle Cells (SMCs) play a vital role in maintaining homeostasis in the aorta by sensing and responding to mechanical stimuli. However, the mechanisms that underlie the ability of SMCs to sense and respond to stiffness change in their environment are still partially unclear. In this study, we focus on the role of acto-myosin contractility in stiffness sensing and introduce a novel continuum mechanics approach based on the principles of thermal strains. Each stress fiber satisfies a universal stress-strain relationship driven by a Youngs modulus, a contraction coefficient scaling the fictitious thermal strain, a maximum contraction stress and a softening parameter describing the sliding effects between actin and myosin filaments. To account for the inherent variability of cellular responses, large populations of SMCs are modeled with the finite-element method, each cell having a random number and a random arrangement of stress fibers. Moreover, the level of myosin activation in each stress fiber satisfies a Weibull probability density function. Model predictions are compared to traction force measurements on different SMC lineages. It is demonstrated that the model not only predicts well the effects of substrate stiffness on cellular traction, but it can also successfully approximate the statistical variations of cellular tractions induced by intercellular variability. Finally, stresses in the nuclear envelope and in the nucleus are computed with the model, showing that the variations of cytoskeletal forces induced by substrate stiffness directly induce deformations of the nucleus which can potentially alter gene expression. The predictability of the model combined to its relative simplicity are promising assets for further investigation of stiffness sensing in 3D environments. Eventually, this could contribute to decipher the effects of mechanosensitivity impairment, which are known to be at the root of aortic aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Plant external surfaces are often covered by barriers that control the exchange of molecules, protect from pathogens, and offer mechanical integrity. A key question is when and how such surface barriers are generated. Post-embryonic surfaces have well-studied barriers, including the cuticle, and late Arabidopsis embryo was shown to be protected by an endosperm-derived sheath deposited onto a primordial cuticle. Here we show that both cuticle and sheath are preceded by another structure during the earliest stages of embryogenesis. This structure, which we named the embryonic envelope, is tightly wrapped around the embryonic surface but can be physically detached by cell wall digestion. We show that this structure is composed primarily of Extensin and Arabinogalactan O-glycoproteins and lipids, which appear to form a dense and elastic crosslinked embryonic envelope. The envelope forms in cuticle-deficient mutants and in a mutant that lacks endosperm. This embryo-derived envelope is therefore distinct from previously described cuticle and sheath structures. We propose that it acts as an expandable diffusion barrier, as well as a means to mechanically confine the embryo to maintain its tensegrity during early embryogenesis.\n\nSummary statementThe early Arabidopsis embryo is surrounded by a proteinaceous envelope that is distinct from the cuticle or embryo sheath",

    "abstract": "The stem, consisting of nodes and internodes, is one of the major organs in seed plants. In contrast to other organs, however, processes of stem development remain elusive, especially when nodes and internodes are initiated. By introducing an intron into the Cre recombinase gene, we established a heat-shock inducible clonal analysis system in a single binary vector and applied it to the stem in the flag leaf phytomer of rice. With detailed characterizations of stem development, we show that cell fate acquisition for each domain of the stem occurs stepwise. Cell fates for a single phytomer and the foot (non-elongating domain at the stem base) were established in the shoot apical meristem by one plastochron before the leaf initiation. The fate acquisition for the node occurred just before the leaf initiation, separating cell lineages for leaves and stems. Subsequently, fates for the axillary bud were established in early leaf primordia. Finally, cells committed to the internode emerged from, at most, a few tiers of cells when the stem epidermis was at the 12[~]25 celled stage. Thus, the internode is the last part of the stem whose cell fate is established. This study provides a groundwork to unveil underlying molecular mechanisms in stem development and a useful tool for clonal analysis, which can be applied to various species.",

    "abstract": "Unit activity in particular deep neural networks (DNNs) are remarkably similar to the neuronal population responses to static images along the primate ventral visual cortex. Lin-ear combinations of DNN unit activities are widely used to build predictive models of neu-ronal activity in the visual cortex. Nevertheless, prediction performance in these models is often investigated on stimulus sets consisting of everyday objects under naturalistic set-tings. Recent work has revealed a generalization gap in how predicting neuronal responses to synthetically generated out-of-distribution (OOD) stimuli. Here, we investigated how the recent progress in improving DNNs object recognition generalization, as well as various DNN design choices such as architecture, learning algorithm, and datasets have impacted the generalization gap in neural predictivity. We came to a surprising conclusion that the performance on none of the common computer vision OOD object recognition benchmarks is predictive of OOD neural predictivity performance. Furthermore, we found that adver-sarially robust models often yield substantially higher generalization in neural predictivity, although the degree of robustness itself was not predictive of neural predictivity score. These results suggest that improving object recognition behavior on current benchmarks alone may not lead to more general models of neurons in the primate ventral visual cortex.",

We combine information from a large-scale metatranscriptomic dataset from natural poplar trees and experimental genetic manipulation assays in model Arabidopsis seedlings to converge on a conserved role for transport of the plant metabolite myo-inositol in mediating host-microbe interactions. While microbial catabolism of this compound is often linked to increased host colonization, we identify motility phenotypes that occur independently of catabolism, suggesting that inositol may additionally serve as a eukaryotic-derived signaling molecule to modulate microbial activities.

    "abstract": "The evolutionary mechanism(s) underlying the expression of novel microRNAs (miRs) are still elusive. To explore this issue, we studied the expression of intronic primate-specific hsa-miR-608, located in the Semaphorin 4G (SEMA4G) gene. Engineered  humanized mice carrying human miR-608 flanked by 250 bp in the murine Sema4g gene expressed miR-608 in several tissues. Moreover, miR-608 flanked by shortened fragments of its human genome region elevated miR-608 levels by 100-fold in murine and human-originated cells, identifying the 150 nucleotides 5 to pre-miR-608 as an active promoter. Surprisingly, pulldown of this 5 sequence revealed tight interaction with ribosomal protein L24 (RPL24), which inhibited miR-608 expression. Furthermore, RPL24 depletion altered the levels of 22 miRs, and we discovered that direct interaction of RPL24 with DDX5, a component of the large microprocessor complex, inhibits pri-miR processing. Moreover, RPL24 depletion resulted in Angiogenin (ANG)-mediated production of 5-half tRFs in human cells, and altered plant tRF profiles. Expanding previous reports that RPL24 regulates miR processing in Arabidopsis thaliana, we implicate RPL24 in an evolutionarily-conserved regulation of miR processing and tRF production.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=145 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/539194v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4f2058org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d4a2cdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c7786org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7b1608_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Cardiomyocytes in the sinoatrial node (SAN) are specialized to undergo spontaneous diastolic depolarization (DD) to create action potentials (AP) that serve as the origin of the heartbeat. Two cellular clocks govern DD: the membrane clock where ion channels contribute ionic conductance to create DD and the Ca2+ clock where rhythmic Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during diastole contributes pacemaking. How the membrane and Ca2+ clocks interact to synchronize and drive DD is not well understood. Here, we identified stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), the activator of store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), in the P-cell cardiomyocytes of the SAN. Functional studies from STIM1 KO mice reveal dramatic changes in properties of AP and DD. Mechanistically, we show that STIM1 regulates the funny currents and HCN4 channels that are required to initiate DD and maintain sinus rhythm in mice. Taken together, our studies suggest that STIM1 acts as a sensor for both the Ca2+ and membrane clocks for mouse SAN for cardiac pacemaking.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the intracellular calcium concentration are a fundamental fingerprint of astrocytes, the main type of glial cell. Astrocyte calcium signals can be measured with two-photon microscopy, occur in anatomically restricted subcellular regions, and are coordinated across astrocytic networks. However, current analytical tools to identify the astrocytic subcellular regions where calcium signals occur are time-consuming and extensively rely on user-defined parameters. These limitations limit reproducibility and prevent scalability to large datasets and fields-of-view. Here, we present Astrocytic calcium Spatio-Temporal Rapid Analysis (ASTRA), a novel software combining deep learning with image feature engineering for fast and fully automated semantic segmentation of two-photon calcium imaging recordings of astrocytes. We applied ASTRA to several two-photon microscopy datasets and found that ASTRA performed rapid detection and segmentation of astrocytic cell somata and processes with performance close to that of human experts, outperformed state-of-the-art algorithms for the analysis of astrocytic and neuronal calcium data, and generalized across indicators and acquisition parameters. We also applied ASTRA to the first report of two-photon mesoscopic imaging of hundreds of astrocytes in awake mice, documenting large-scale redundant and synergistic interactions in extended astrocytic networks. ASTRA is a powerful tool enabling closed-loop and large-scale reproducible investigation of astrocytic morphology and function.",

    "abstract": "The auditory system computes the position of a sound along each of the three spatial axes, azimuth, elevation and distance, from very different acoustical cues. The extraction of sound azimuth from binaural cues (differences in arrival time and intensity between the ears) is well understood, as is the representation of these binaural cues in the auditory cortex of different species. Sound elevation is computed from monaural spectral cues arising from direction-dependent filtering of the pinnae, head, and upper body. The cortical representation of these cues in humans is still debated. We have shown that the fMRI blood-oxigen level-dependent activity in small parts of auditory cortex relates monotonically to perceived sound elevation and tracks listeners internal adaptation to new spectral cues. Here we confirm the previously suggested cortical code with a different method that reflects neural activity rather than blood oxigenation (electroencephalography), show that elevation is represented relatively late in the cortex, with related activity peaking at about 400 ms after sound onset, and show that differences in sound elevation can be decoded from the electroencephalogram of listeners, particularely from those who can distinguish elevations well. We used an adaptation design to isolate elevation-specific brain responses from those to other features of the stimuli. These responses gradually increased with decreasing sound elevation, consistent with our previous fMRI findings and population rate code for sound elevation. The long latency as well as the topographical distribution of the elevation-specific brain response indicates the involvement of higher-level cognitive processes not present for binaural cue representation. The differences between brain responses to sounds at different elevations predicted the listeners sound localization accuracy, suggesting that these responses reflect perceived elevation. This is, to our knowledge, the first study that demonstrates the cortical encoding of sound elevation in humans with high-temporal resolution. Our results agree with previous findings from functional magnetic resonance imaging, providing strong support for the hypothesis that elevation is represented in a population-rate code. This represents a critical advance in our understanding of spatial auditory processing along a dimension that is still poorly understood.",

    "abstract": "A major aspiration of investors is to better forecast stock performance. Interestingly, emerging  neuroforecasting research suggests that brain activity associated with anticipatory reward relates to market behavior and population-wide preferences, including stock price dynamics. In this study we extend these findings to professional investors processing comprehensive real-world information on stock investment options while making predictions of long-term stock performance. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we sampled investors neural responses to investment cases and assessed whether these responses relate to future performance on the stock market. We find that our sample of investors could not successfully predict future market performance of the investment cases, confirming that stated preferences do not predict the market. Stock metrics of the investment cases were not predictive of future stock performance either. However, as investors processed case information, nucleus accumbens (NAcc) activity was higher for investment cases that ended up overperforming in the market. These findings remained robust, even when controlling for stock metrics and investors predictions made in the scanner. Cross-validated prediction analysis indicated that NAcc activity could significantly predict future stock performance out-of-sample above chance. Our findings resonate with recent neuroforecasting studies and suggest that brain activity of professional investors may help in forecasting future stock performance.\n\nSignificance StatementThe investors dream of forecasting the stock market is typically considered to be just that: An unrealistic aspiration. However, we find that forecasting stock performance may in fact not be completely unattainable. Results of our neuroimaging experiment reveal that professional investors fail to accurately predict long-term stock performance. However, while processing complex information pertaining to investment cases, brain activity in a region associated with reward anticipation was increased for stocks that would end up overperforming in the future market. Remarkably, this effect held after controlling for the stock information presented in the investment cases. Our findings add to recent work in  neuroforecasting, demonstrating that market behavior can be forecasted by brain activity of a small sample, here of professional investors.",

Our model was trained and tested on data from mice undergoing baseline sleep, sleep deprivation, and recovery sleep, enabling it to handle a wide range of sleep conditions. Employing k-fold cross-validation and data augmentation techniques, SlumberNet achieved high levels of accuracy ([~]98%) in predicting sleep stages and showed robust performance even with a small and diverse training dataset. Comparison of SlumberNets performance to manual sleep stage classification revealed a significant reduction in analysis time ([~]50x faster), without sacrificing accuracy. Our study showcases the potential of deep learning to facilitate sleep research by providing a more efficient, accurate, and scalable method for sleep stage classification. Our work with SlumberNet demonstrates the power of deep learning in sleep research, and looking forward, SlumberNet could be adapted to human EEG analysis and sleep stage classification.

    "abstract": "Adrenergic signaling is known to play a critical role in regulating female reproductive processes in both mammals and insects. In Drosophila, the ortholog of noradrenaline, octopamine (Oa), is required for ovulation as well as several other female reproductive processes. Loss of function studies using mutant alleles of receptors, transporters, and biosynthetic enzymes for Oa have led to a model in which disruption of octopaminergic pathways reduces egg laying. However, neither the complete expression pattern in the reproductive tract nor the role of most octopamine receptors in oviposition is known. We show that all six known Oa receptors are expressed in peripheral neurons at multiple sites within in the female fly reproductive tract as well as in non-neuronal cells within the sperm storage organs. The complex pattern of Oa receptor expression in the reproductive tract suggests the potential for influencing multiple regulatory pathways, including those known to inhibit egg-laying in unmated flies. Indeed, activation of some neurons that express Oa receptors inhibits oviposition, and neurons that express different subtypes of Oa receptor can affect different stages of egg laying. Stimulation of some Oa receptor expressing neurons (OaRNs) also induces contractions in lateral oviduct muscle and activation of non-neuronal cells in the sperm storage organs by Oa generates OAMB-dependent intracellular calcium release. Our results are consistent with a model in which adrenergic pathways play a variety of complex roles in the fly reproductive tract that includes both the stimulation and inhibition of oviposition.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been associated with Alzheimers disease (AD). However, the functional role of lncRNAs in AD remains unclear. Here, we report a crucial role for the lncRNA Neat1 in astrocyte dysfunction and memory deficits associated with AD. Transcriptomics analysis show abnormally high expression levels of NEAT1 in the brains of AD patients relative to aged-matched healthy controls, with the most significantly elevated levels in glial cells. In a human transgenic APP-J20 (J20) mouse model of AD, RNA-fluorescent in situ hybridization characterization of Neat1 expression in hippocampal astrocyte versus non-astrocyte cell populations revealed a significant increase in Neat1 expression in astrocytes of male, but not female, mice. This corresponded with increased seizure susceptibility in J20 male mice. Interestingly, Neat1 deficiency in the dCA1 in J20 male mice did not alter seizure threshold. Mechanistically, Neat1 deficiency in the dorsal area CA1 of the hippocampus (dCA1) J20 male mice significantly improved hippocampus-dependent memory. Neat1 deficiency also remarkably reduced astrocyte reactivity markers suggesting that Neat1 overexpression is associated with astrocyte dysfunction induced by hAPP/A{beta} in the J20 mice. Together, these findings indicate that abnormal Neat1 overexpression may contribute to memory deficits in the J20 AD model not through altered neuronal activity, but through astrocyte dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The Pseudomonas genus has shown great potential as a sustainable solution to support agriculture through its plant-growth promoting and biocontrol activities. However, their efficacy as bioinoculants is limited by unpredictable colonization in natural conditions. Our study identifies the iol locus, a gene cluster in Pseudomonas involved in inositol catabolism, as a feature enriched among superior root colonizers in natural soil. Further characterization revealed that the iol locus increases competitiveness by inducing swimming motility and fluorescent siderophore production in response to inositol, a plant-derived compound. Public data analyses indicate that the iol locus is broadly conserved in the Pseudomonas genus and linked to diverse host-microbe interactions. Our findings suggest the iol locus as a potential target for developing more effective bioinoculants, given its conservation and association with diverse host-microbe interactions.",

    "abstract": "Powassan virus (POWV) is an emerging tick-borne Flavivirus that causes lethal encephalitis and long term neurologic damage. Currently there are no POWV therapeutics, licensed vaccines or reverse genetics systems for producing infectious POWVs from recombinant DNA. Here we used a circular polymerase extension reaction (CPER) approach to generate recombinant LI9 (recLI9) POWVs with attenuating NS1 protein mutations and a recLI9-split-eGFP reporter virus. Flavivirus NS1 proteins are highly conserved glycoproteins that regulate replication, spread and neurovirulence. POWV NS1 proteins contain three putative N-linked glycosylation sites that we modified individually in infectious recLI9 mutants (N85Q, N208Q, N224Q). NS1 glycosylation site mutations reduced replication kinetics and were attenuated with a 1-2 log decrease in infectious titers. The severely attenuated recLI9-N224Q mutant exhibited a 2-3 day delay in focal cell-to-cell spread and reduced NS1 secretion. Like WT LI9, the recLI9-N224Q mutant was lethal when intracranially inoculated into suckling mice. However, footpad inoculation of recLI9-N224Q resulted in the survival of 80% of mice and demonstrated that NS1-N224Q mutations attenuate POWV neuroinvasion in vivo. To monitor NS1 trafficking, we CPER fused a split GFP11-tag to the NS1 C-terminus and generated an infectious reporter virus, recLI9-NS1-GFP11. Cells infected with recLI9-NS1-GFP11 revealed NS1 trafficking in live cells and the novel formation of large NS1 lined intracellular vesicles. An infectious recLI9-NS1-GFP11 reporter virus permits real-time analysis of NS1 functions in POWV replication, assembly and secretion, and provides a platform for evaluating antiviral compounds. Collectively, our robust POWV reverse genetics system permits analysis of viral spread and neurovirulence determinants in vitro and in vivo, and enables the rational genetic design of live attenuated POWV vaccines.",

    "abstract": "During preimplantation development, mouse embryos form a fluid-filled lumen, which sets their first axis of symmetry1,2. Pressurized fluid breaks open cell-cell contacts and accumulates into pockets, which gradually coarsen into a single lumen3-5. During coarsening, the adhesive and contractile properties of cells are thought to guide intercellular fluid (IF) but what cell behavior may control fluid movements is unknown. Here, we report large fluid-filled spherical membrane intrusions called inverse blebs6,7 growing into cells at adhesive contacts. At the onset of lumen coarsening, we observed hundreds of inverse blebs throughout the embryo, each dynamically filling with IF and retracting within a minute. We find that inverse blebs grow due to pressure build-up resulting from luminal fluid accumulation and cell-cell adhesion, which locally confines fluid. Inverse blebs then retract due to actomyosin contraction, which effectively redistributes fluid within the intercellular space. Importantly, inverse blebs show topological specificity and only occur at contacts between two cells, not at contacts formed by multiple cells, which essentially serve as fluid sinks. Manipulating the topology of the embryo reveals that, in the absence of sinks, inverse blebs pump fluid into one another in a futile cycle. We propose that inverse blebs operate as hydraulic pumps to promote luminal coarsening, thereby constituting an instrument used by cells to control fluid movement.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLymphangiogenesis is believed to be a protective response in the setting of multiple forms of kidney injury and mitigates the progression of interstitial fibrosis. To augment this protective response, promoting kidney lymphangiogenesis is being investigated as a potential treatment to slow the progression of kidney disease.\n\nAs injury related lymphangiogenesis is driven by signaling from the receptor VEGFR-3 in response to the cognate growth factor VEGF-C released by tubular epithelial cells, this signaling pathway is a candidate for future kidney therapeutics. However, the consequences to kidney development and function to targeting this signaling pathway remains poorly defined.\n\nMethodsWe generated a new mouse model expressing Vegf-C under regulation of the nephron progenitor Six2Cre driver strain (Six2Vegf-C). Mice underwent a detailed phenotypic evaluation. Whole kidneys were processed for histology and micro computed tomography 3-dimensional imaging.\n\nResultsSix2Vegf-C mice had reduced body weight and kidney function compared to littermate controls. Six2Vegf-C kidneys demonstrated large peripelvic fluid filled lesions with distortion of the pelvicalcyceal system which progressed in severity with age. 3D imaging showed a 3-fold increase in total cortical vascular density. Histology confirmed a substantial increase in LYVE1+/PDPN+/VEGFR3+ lymphatic capillaries extending alongside EMCN+ peritubular capillaries. There was no change in EMCN+ peritubular capillary density.\n\nConclusionsKidney lymphangiogenesis was robustly induced in the Six2Vegf-C mice. There were no changes in peritubular blood capillary density despite these endothelial cells also expressing VEGFR-3. The model resulted in a severe cystic kidney phenotype that resembled a human condition termed renal lymphangiectasia. This study defines the vascular consequences of augmenting VEGF-C signaling during kidney development and provides new insight into a mimicker of human cystic kidney disease.",

    "abstract": "Formation, maintenance, and differentiation of tissue-specific progenitor cells are fundamental tasks during organogenesis. Retinal development is an excellent model for dissecting these processes; mechanisms of retinal differentiation can be harnessed for retinal regeneration toward curing blindness. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of embryonic mouse eye cups in which transcription factor Six3 was conditionally inactivated in peripheral retinas on top of germline deletion of its close paralog Six6 (\"DKO\"), we identified cell clusters and then inferred developmental trajectories in the integrated dataset. In control retinas, naive retinal progenitor cells had two major trajectories leading to ciliary margin cells and retinal neurons, respectively. The ciliary margin trajectory was directly from naive retinal progenitor cells at G1 phase, and the retinal neuron trajectory was through a neurogenic state marked by Atoh7 expression. Upon Six3 and Six6 dual deficiency, both naive and neurogenic retinal progenitor cells were defective. Ciliary margin differentiation was enhanced, and multi-lineage retinal differentiation was disrupted. An ectopic neuronal trajectory lacking the Atoh7+ state led to ectopic neurons. Differential expression analysis not only confirmed previous phenotype studies but also identified novel candidate genes regulated by Six3/Six6. Six3 and Six6 were jointly required for balancing the opposing gradients of the Fgf and Wnt signaling in the central-peripheral patterning of the eye cups. Taken together, we identify transcriptomes and developmental trajectories jointly regulated by Six3 and Six6, providing deeper insight into molecular mechanisms underlying early retinal differentiation.",

We performed four parallel genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens to investigate the interplay between these two aspects of pluripotency. Our comparative analyses led to the discovery of genes with distinct roles in pluripotency regulation, including many mitochondrial and metabolism regulators crucial for stem cell fitness, and chromatin regulators that control stem cell identity. We further discovered a core set of factors that control both stem cell fitness and pluripotency identity, including an interconnected network of chromatin factors that safeguard pluripotency. Our unbiased and systematic screening and comparative analyses disentangle two interconnected aspects of pluripotency, provide rich datasets for exploring pluripotent cell identity versus self-renewal, and offer a valuable model for categorizing gene function in broad biological contexts.",

    "abstract": "Development can proceed in \"fits and starts\", with rapid transitions between cell states involving concerted transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression. However, it is not clear how these transitions are regulated in complex cell populations, in which cells receive multiple inputs. It is also not clear to what extent these rapid transitions represent developmental commitment. Here we address these issues using Dictyostelium cells undergoing development in their physiological niche. A continuous single cell transcriptomics time series reveals a sharp \"jump\" in global gene expression marking functionally different cell states. By simultaneously live imaging the physiological dynamics of transcription and signalling over millimetre length scales, we show that the jump coincides with the onset of collective oscillations of cAMP, the positive feedback signal for multicellular development. Different jump genes respond to distinct dynamic features of signalling. The late gene expression changes of the jump are almost completely dependent on cAMP. In contrast, transcript changes at the onset of the jump require additional input. The spatial boundary marking the jump divides cells separated by only a few minutes of developmental time, with cells missing a jump then waiting several hours for the onset of the next wave of cAMP oscillations. This timing variability contrasts the prevailing developmental paradigm of a timed synchronous process and is associated with substantial pre-jump transcriptome variability. The coupling of collective signalling with gene expression is a potentially powerful strategy to drive robust cell state transitions in heterogeneous signalling environments. Based on the context of the jump, we also conclude that sharp gene expression transitions may not be sufficient for commitment.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant dopamine (DA) signaling is implicated in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (BPD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), substance use disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Treatment of these disorders remains inadequate. We established that the human DA transporter (DAT) coding variant (DAT Val559), identified in individuals with ADHD, ASD, or BPD, exhibits anomalous DA efflux (ADE) that is blocked by therapeutic amphetamines and methylphenidate. As the latter agents have high abuse liability, we exploited DAT Val559 knock-in mice to identify non-addictive agents that can normalize DAT Val559 functional and behavioral effects ex vivo and in vivo. Kappa opioid receptors (KORs) are expressed by DA neurons and modulate DA release and clearance, suggesting that targeting KORs might offset the effects of DAT Val559. We establish that enhanced DAT Thr53 phosphorylation and increased DAT surface trafficking associated with DAT Val559 expression are mimicked by KOR agonism of wildtype preparations and rescued by KOR antagonism of DAT Val559 ex vivo preparations. Importantly, KOR antagonism also corrected in vivo DA release and sex-dependent behavioral abnormalities. Given their low abuse liability, our studies with a construct valid model of human DA associated disorders reinforce considerations of KOR antagonism as a pharmacological strategy to treat DA associated brain disorders.",

However, most stimuli that are commonly used in vision research only reveal neural responses to single features, such as a specific stimulus orientation. How larger feature distributions affect neural responses and visual perception is therefore poorly understood. To address this question, we presented broadband visual stimuli with parametrically-controlled bandwidth of stimulus orientations and spatial frequencies to awake mice while recording the activity of neural populations in the primary visual cortex with two-photon imaging. Matching the orientation bandwidth of broadband stimuli to naturalistic images strongly increased neural responses and improved feature discrimination performance. Correspondingly, increasing orientation bandwidth also improved the performance of mice in a visual discrimination task. Our results strongly suggest that the visual system is tuned to the feature distributions of naturalistic visual inputs, with broader feature distributions driving more robust neural responses and enhanced visual perception.",

Here, we show that antibodies against this THSD7A segment in mice induce typical clinical and morphological signs of membranous nephropathy. The high-resolution structure of these two domains reveals a non-canonical thrombospondin repeat fold that is distinct from the established type 1 thrombospondin repeat. As it shares a conserved disulfide pattern with the canonical fold, we refer to these domains d1 and d2 as type 1A thrombospondin repeats. Both domains comprise a seven layered CC-W-PP-R-W-QQ-CC pattern, which is only partly shared by other THSD7A thrombospondin repeat domains. The two domains form a well-defined V-shaped tandem arrangement.

These common vOTUs regularly comprised >65% of the viral community by relative abundance. Many (56%) of the vOTUs were detected both during the tomato growing season and post-harvest, indicating persistence through time. Together, these results indicate habitat-specific differences in viral community composition, yet relative stability and persistence of viral communities within agricultural soils, in contrast to their recently observed dynamics in natural soils.",

The cellular responses of these two strains, one containing the thermostable direct hemolysin (tdh+) gene and the other one containing tdh-related hemolysin (trh+) gene, were studied at the transcriptomic level. Results showed that, at 30 {degrees}C, tdh+ and trh+ strains reached 6.77 {+/-} 0.20 and 6.14 {+/-} 0.07 Log CFU/ml respectively after 5 days. During this time, higher growth rate was observed in the tdh+ strain than the trh+ strain. When being kept at 10 {degrees}C, both Vp strains persisted at ca. 3.0 Log CFU/ml in seawater with no difference observed between them. Growth and persistence predictive models were then established based on the Baranyi equation. The goodness of fit scores ranged from 0.674 to 0.950. RNA sequencing results showed that downregulated central energy metabolism and weakened degradation of branched chain amino acid were observed only in trh+ strain not in tdh+ strain at 30 {degrees}C. This might be one reason for the lower growth rates of the trh+ strain at 30 {degrees}C. Histidine metabolism and biofilm formation pathways were significantly downregulated in both strains at 10 {degrees}C. No significant difference was observed for virulence-associated gene expression between 10 and 30 {degrees}C, regardless of the strains.\n\nSIGINIFICANCEGiven the involvement of Vp in a wide range of seafood outbreaks, a systematical characterization of Vp fitness and transcriptomic changes at temperatures of critical importance for seafood production and storage is needed. In this study, predictive models describing the behavior of Vp strains containing different virulence factors are established. While no difference was observed at the lower temperature (10 C), tdh+ strain had faster growth rate than the trh+ strain. Transcriptomic analysis showed that significantly higher number of genes were upregulated at 30 {degrees}C than 10 {degrees}C. Majority of differentially expressed genes of Vp at 30 {degrees}C were annotated to functional categories supporting cellular growth. At the lower temperature, the down regulation of the biofilm formation pathway and histidine metabolism indicates that the current practice of storing seafood at lower temperatures not only protect the seafood quality but also ensure the seafood safety.",

    "abstract": "Flaviviruses are single-stranded positive-sense RNA (+RNA) viruses that are responsible for several (re)emerging diseases such as Yellow, Dengue or West Nile fevers. The Zika epidemic highlighted their dangerousness when a relatively benign virus known since the 1950s turned into a deadly pathogen. The central protein for their replication is NS5 (non-structural protein 5), which is composed of the N-terminal methyltransferase (MTase) domain and the C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) domain. It is responsible for both, RNA replication and installation of the 5 RNA cap. We structurally and biochemically analyzed the Ntaya virus MTase and RdRp domains and we compared their properties to other flaviviral NS5s. The enzymatic centers are well conserved across Flaviviridae, suggesting that the development of drugs targeting all flaviviruses is feasible. However, the enzymatic activities of the isolated proteins were significantly different for the MTase domains.",

    "abstract": "Circulating lactate is a fuel source for liver metabolism but may exacerbate metabolic diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Indeed, haploinsufficiency of lactate transporter monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) in mice reportedly promotes resistance to hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Here, we used adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to deliver thyroxin binding globulin (TBG)-Cre or lecithin-retinol acyltransferase (Lrat)-Cre to MCT1fl/fl mice on a choline deficient, high fat NASH diet to deplete hepatocyte or stellate cell MCT1, respectively. Stellate cell MCT1KO (AAV-Lrat-Cre) attenuated liver type 1 collagen protein expression and caused a downward trend in trichrome staining. MCT1 depletion in cultured human LX2 stellate cells also diminished collagen 1 protein expression. Tetra-ethylenglycol-cholesterol (Chol)-conjugated siRNAs, which enter all hepatic cell types, and hepatocyte-selective tri-N-acetyl galactosamine (GN)-conjugated siRNAs were then used to evaluate MCT1 function in a genetically obese NASH mouse model. MCT1 silencing by Chol-siRNA decreased liver collagen 1 levels, while hepatocyte-selective MCT1 depletion by AAV-TBG-Cre or by GN-siRNA unexpectedly increased collagen 1 and total fibrosis without effect on triglyceride accumulation. These findings demonstrate that stellate cell lactate transporter MCT1 significantly contributes to liver fibrosis through increased collagen 1 protein expression in vitro and in vivo, while hepatocyte MCT1 appears not to be an attractive therapeutic target for NASH.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn all organisms, the innate immune system defends against pathogens through basal expression of molecules that provide critical barriers to invasion and inducible expression of effectors that combat infection. The adenosine deaminase that act on RNA (ADAR) family of RNA binding proteins has been reported to influence innate immunity in metazoans. However, studies on the susceptibility of ADAR mutant animals to infection are largely lacking.\n\nResultsHere, by analyzing adr-1 and adr-2 null mutants in well-established slow-killing assays, we find that both Caenorhabditis elegans ADARs are important for organismal survival to gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, all of which are pathogenic to humans. Furthermore, our high-throughput sequencing and genetic analysis reveal that ADR-1 and ADR-2 function in the same pathway to regulate collagen expression. Consistent with this finding, our scanning electron microscopy studies indicate adr-1;adr-2 mutant animals also have altered cuticle morphology prior to pathogen exposure.\n\nConclusionsOur data uncover a critical role of the C. elegans ADAR family of RNA binding proteins in promoting cuticular collagen expression, which represents a new post-transcriptional regulatory node that influences the extracellular matrix. In addition, we provide the first evidence that ADAR mutant animals have altered susceptibility to infection with several opportunistic human pathogens, suggesting a broader role of ADARs in altering physical barriers to infection to influence innate immunity.",

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and is caused by mutations in the gene encoding for the Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). FMRP is an evolutionarily conserved and neuronally enriched RNA binding protein (RBP) with functions in the control of processes including RNA editing, RNA transport, and protein translation. Specific target RNAs play critical roles in neurodevelopment including the regulation of neurite morphogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function. The different biological functions of FMRP are modulated by its cooperative interaction with distinct sets of neuronal RNA and protein binding partners. Here, we focus on interactions between FMRP and components of the microRNA (miRNA) pathway. Using the Drosophila model system, we show that dFMRP can repress the translation of a reporter mRNA via a deadenylation-independent mechanism. This repression requires the activity of both AGO1 and GW182, conserved components of the miRNA-containing RISC (miRISC). Interestingly, we find that dFMRP can bind directly to a short stem loop structure in the reporter and that dFMRP binding is a prerequisite for repression by miR-958. Finally, we show that dFmr1 interacts genetically with GW182 to control neurite morphogenesis. Collectively, these data suggest the dFMRP can directly recruit the miRISC to nearby miRNA binding sites and then repress translation via the activity of the miRISC effector, GW182.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization is a worldwide phenomenon tremendously modifying environmental features. By affecting the reservoirs of pathogens and the body and immune conditions of hosts, it is expected that urbanization alters the epidemiological dynamics and diversity of diseases. Cities could act as a shield against the parasite load or as a parasite burden, depending on whether urban features have positive or negative effects on vectors and hosts. In this study, we investigated the prevalence and diversity of avian malaria parasites (Plasmodium/Haemoproteus sp. and Leucocytozoon sp.) in great tits (Parus major) living across an urbanization gradient. We overall observed high prevalence in adult birds (from 95% to 100%), yet low prevalence in fledglings (from 0% to 38%). Malaria prevalence tended to increase with increasing urbanization in adults, and urban nestlings were more infected with Plasmodium/Haemoproteus sp. than forest ones. We found evidence for lower diversity in malaria lineages in the most natural site but higher diversity in the most natural urban park, while parasite diversity was overall similar across other urbanization levels. Parasite lineages were not habitat specific but for one Plasmodium sp. lineage (YWT4) associated with urban areas and some rare lineages (AFR065) present only in a zoo area perhaps because of the presence of African birds there. This study suggests that urbanization can lead to a \"parasite burden\" for urban dwelling species and can favour different avian malaria lineages. Such results open questions on the eco-evolutionary processes favouring certain disease lineages in urban environments.",

Long separated from the ancient supercontinent Gondwana, most of Australias plants and animals are unique and endemic, including the continents frogs. Australian frogs comprise a remarkable ecological and morphological diversity categorized into a small number of distantly related radiations. We present a phylogenomic hypothesis based on an exon-capture dataset that spans the main clades of Australian myobatrachoid, pelodryadid hyloid, and microhylid frogs. Our time-calibrated phylogenomic-scale phylogeny identifies great disparity in the relative ages of these groups which vary from Gondwanan relics to recent immigrants from Asia and include arguably the continents oldest living vertebrate radiation. This age stratification provides insight into the colonization of, and diversification on, the Australian continent through deep time, during periods of dramatic climatic and community changes. Contemporary Australian frog diversity highlights the adaptive capacity of anurans, particularly in response to heat and aridity, and explains why they are one of the continents most visible faunas.",

To understand how MSH2 regulates crossovers formed by the independent interfering and non-interfering pathways, we combine mutants that elevate non-interfering crossovers with msh2. We demonstrate that MSH2 blocks non-interfering crossovers at polymorphic loci, which is the opposite effect to interfering crossovers. We also observe MSH2-independent crossover inhibition at highly polymorphic sites. We measure recombination along the chromosome arms, in lines differing in the heterozygosity pattern, and observe a dramatic crossover increase at the boundaries between heterozygous and homozygous regions, which is MSH2-dependent. Together, we show that MSH2 is a master regulator of meiotic DSB repair, with antagonistic effects on interfering and non-interfering crossovers, that shapes the crossover landscape in relation to interhomolog polymorphism.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic fungi are a cause of growing concern. Developing an efficient and safe antifungal is challenging because of the similar biological properties of fungal and host cells. Consequently, there is an urgent need to better understand the mechanisms underlying antifungal resistance to prolong the efficacy of current molecules. A major step in this direction would be to be able to predict or even prevent the acquisition of resistance. We leverage the power of experimental evolution to quantify the diversity of paths to resistance to the antifungal 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), commercially known as flucytosine. We generated hundreds of independent 5-FC resistant mutants derived from two genetic backgrounds from wild isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Through automated pin-spotting, whole-genome and amplicon sequencing, we identified the most likely causes of resistance for most strains. Approximately a third of all resistant mutants evolved resistance through the pleiotropic drug response, a potentially novel mechanism in response to 5-FC, marked by cross-resistance to fluconazole. For the majority of the remaining two thirds, resistance was acquired through loss-of-function mutations in FUR1, which encodes an important enzyme in the metabolism of 5-FC. We describe conditions in which mutations affecting this particular step of the metabolic pathway are favored over known resistance mutations affecting a step upstream, such as the well-known target cytosine deaminase encoded by FCY1. This observation suggests that ecological interactions may dictate the identity of resistance hotspots.",

We examined direct RNA sequencing data from diverse taxa including virus, bacteria, fungi, and animals. The algorithm consistently identified a 5-methylcytosine at the central position of a GCU motif. However, it also identified a 5-methylcytosine in the same motif in fully unmodified in vitro transcribed RNA, suggesting that this a frequent false prediction.

Nanopore sequencing technology provides an attractive means of detecting these modifications directly on the RNA, but accurate modification predictions are dependent upon the software developed to interpret the sequencing results. One of these tools, Tombo, allows users to detect modifications using sequencing results from a single RNA sample. However, we find that this method falsely predicts modifications in a specific sequence context across a variety of RNA samples, including RNA that lacks modifications. Results from previous publications include predictions in human coronaviruses with this sequence context and should be reconsidered.

We find here that Rad24-RFC loads 9-1-1 onto DNA gaps in preference to a recessed 5' DNA end, thus presumably leaving 9-1-1 on a 3' ss/ds DNA after Rad24-RFC ejects from the 5' gap end and may explain reports of 9-1-1 directly functioning in DNA repair with various TLS polymerases, in addition to signaling the ATR kinase. To gain a deeper understanding of 9-1-1 loading at gaps we report high-resolution structures of Rad24-RFC during loading of 9-1-1 onto 10-nt and 5-nt gapped DNAs. At a 10-nt gap we captured five Rad24-RFC-9-1-1 loading intermediates in which the 9-1-1 DNA entry gate varies from fully open to fully closed around DNA using ATP{gamma}S, supporting the emerging view that ATP hydrolysis is not needed for clamp opening/closing, but instead for dissociation of the loader from the clamp encircling DNA. The structure of Rad24-RFC-9-1-1 at a 5-nt gap shows a 180{degrees} axially rotated 3'-dsDNA which orients the template strand to bridge the 3'- and 5'- junctions with a minimum 5-nt ssDNA. The structures reveal a unique loop on Rad24 that limits the length of dsDNA in the inner chamber, and inability to melt DNA ends unlike RFC, thereby explaining Rad24-RFCs preference for a preexisting ssDNA gap and suggesting a direct role in gap repair in addition to its checkpoint role.",

How a primosome is assembled and how the length of the RNA primer is defined in the T4 bacteriophage, or in any model system, are unclear. Here we report a series of cryo-EM structures of T4 primosome assembly intermediates at resolutions up to 2.7 [A]. We show that the gp41 helicase is an open spiral in the absence of ssDNA, and ssDNA binding triggers a large-scale scissor-like conformational change that drives the open spiral to a closed ring that activates the helicase. We found that the activation of the gp41 helicase exposes a cryptic hydrophobic primase-binding surface allowing for the recruitment of the gp61 primase. The primase binds the gp41 helicase in a bipartite mode in which the N-terminal Zn-binding domain (ZBD) and the C-terminal RNA polymerase domain (RPD) each contain a helicase-interacting motif (HIM1 and HIM2, respectively) that bind to separate gp41 N-terminal hairpin dimers, leading to the assembly of one primase on the helicase hexamer. Based on two observed primosome conformations - one in a DNA-scanning mode and the other in a post RNA primer-synthesis mode - we suggest that the linker loop between the gp61 ZBD and RPD contributes to the T4 pentaribonucleotide primer. Our study reveals T4 primosome assembly process and sheds light on RNA primer synthesis mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Electroactive bacteria combine the oxidation of carbon substrates with an extracellular electron transfer (EET) process that discharges electrons to an electron acceptor outside the cell. This process involves electron transfer through consecutive redox proteins that efficiently connect the inner membrane to the cell exterior. In this study, we isolated and characterized the quinone-interacting membrane cytochrome c ImcH from Geobacter sulfurreducens, which is involved in the EET process to high redox potential acceptors. Our work provides evidence that ImcH is electroneutral, as it transfers electrons and protons to the same side of the membrane, contributing to the maintenance of a proton motive force, and plays a central role in recycling the menaquinone pool.\n\nImportanceGeobacter sulfurreducens is a model electroactive bacterium, widespread in the environment and of significant interest for biotechnological applications. Its ability to form thick and conductive biofilms on top of conducting surfaces makes this microbe very useful in bioelectrochemical systems for the production of energy or added value products. To explore Geobacter spp. as a biocatalyst it is essential to understand its metabolism, particularly the molecular mechanisms for extracellular electron transfer and energy conservation. Our results reveal the importance of ImcH in both processes, identifying this protein as a major player on Geobacter metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic polymerase  (Pol ) is a dual-function DNA polymerase/primase complex that synthesizes an RNA-DNA hybrid primer of 20-30 nucleotides for DNA replication. Pol  is composed of Pol1, Pol12, Primase 1 (Pri1), and Pri2, with Pol1 and Pri1 containing the DNA polymerase activity and RNA primase activity, respectively, whereas Pol12 and Pri2 serve a structural role. It has been unclear how Pol  hands over an RNA primer made by Pri1 to Pol1 for DNA primer extension, and how the primer length is defined, perhaps due to the difficulty in studying the highly mobile structure. Here we report a comprehensive cryo-EM analysis of the intact 4-subunit yeast Pol  in the apo, primer initiation, primer elongation, RNA primer hand-off from Pri1 to Pol1, and DNA extension states in a 3.5 [A] - 5.6 [A] resolution range. We found that Pol  is a three-lobed flexible structure. Pri2 functions as a flexible hinge that holds together the catalytic Pol1-core, and the noncatalytic Pol1 CTD that binds to Pol 12 to form a stable platform upon which the other components are organized. In the apo state, Pol1-core is sequestered on the Pol12-Pol1-CTD platform, and Pri1 is mobile perhaps in search of a template. Upon binding a ssDNA template, a large conformation change is induced that enables Pri1 to perform RNA synthesis, and positions Pol1-core to accept the future RNA primed site 50 [A] upstream of where Pri1 binds. We reveal in detail the critical point at which Pol1-core takes over the 3-end of the RNA from Pri1. DNA primer extension appears limited by the spiral motion of Pol1-core while Pri2-CTD stably holds onto the 5 end of the RNA primer. Since both Pri1 and Pol1-core are attached via two linkers to the platform, primer growth will produce stress within this \"two-point\" attachment that may limit the length of the RNA-DNA hybrid primer. Hence, this study reveals the large and dynamic series of movements that Pol  undergoes to synthesize a primer for DNA replication.",

New structural data of NLRP3 provide a framework to probe the conformational impact of nucleotide binding. In this study, microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to detail information on the unique structural conformations adopted by NLRP3 with ATP or ADP binding. Sampling convergence reflected a high degree of confidence in the MD simulations as shown by RMSD and protein-nucleotide concordance, favourable overall MM-PBSA ligand binding energies for both nucleotides and low cosine coefficients of the principal eigenvectors obtained with essential dynamics (ED) analysis. NLRP3-ADP simulations provide relatively stable conformations with few global rearrangements as shown by decreased protein RMSD, Rg, SASA, and solvent accessibility for the ADP-bound structure. In contrast, ATP binding induced increased flexibility and resulted in substantive conformational changes to the NLRP3 structure. Binding of ATP was thermodynamically favourable as shown by the {Delta}Gsolv and MM-PBSA calculations of complex free energies, and these NLRP3-ATP simulations resulted in similar structural transitions as observed in the activated NLRC4 empirical structure. Lastly, the active conformation of NLRP3 critically depends on hinging between the HD2 and LRR domains, whereby ATP binding drives local conformational changes that are conveyed to the global structure.",

Our results showed that the oral bacterium Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) produces OMVs with a bimodal size distribution, where larger OMVs were much more likely to possess leukotoxin (LtxA). Among the smallest OMVs (< 100 nm diameter), the fraction that are toxin positive ranges from 0-30%, while the largest OMVs (> 200 nm diameter) are between 70-100% toxin positive.

    "abstract": "Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is fatal and therapeutically under-served. We describe a novel CRPC-restraining role for the vasodilatory soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) pathway. We discovered that sGC subunits are dysregulated during CRPC progression and its catalytic product, cyclic GMP (cGMP), is lowered in CRPC patients. Abrogating sGC heterodimer formation in castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC) cells inhibited androgen deprivation (AD)-induced senescence, and promoted castration-resistant tumor growth. We found sGC is oxidatively inactivated in CRPC. Paradoxically, AD restored sGC activity in CRPC cells through redox-protective responses evoked to protect against AD-induced oxidative stress. sGC stimulation via its FDA-approved agonist, riociguat, inhibited castration-resistant growth, and the anti-tumor response correlated with elevated cGMP, indicating on-target sGC activity. Consistent with known sGC function, riociguat improved tumor oxygenation, decreasing the PC stem cell marker, CD44, and enhancing radiation-induced tumor suppression. Our studies thus provide the first evidence for therapeutically targeting sGC via riociguat to treat CRPC.\n\nStatement of significanceProstate cancer is the second highest cancer-related cause of death for American men. Once patients progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer, the incurable and fatal stage, there are few viable treatment options available. Here we identify and characterize a new and clinically actionable target, the soluble guanylyl cyclase complex, in castration-resistant prostate cancer. Notably we find that repurposing the FDA-approved and safely tolerated sGC agonist, riociguat, decreases castration-resistant tumor growth and re-sensitizes these tumors to radiation therapy. Thus our study provides both new biology regarding the origins of castration resistance as well as a new and viable treatment option.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus that persistently infects patients, enters protected brain, placental, and testicular compartments, is sexually transmitted, and causes fetal microcephaly in utero. ZIKV persistently infects brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) that form the blood-brain-barrier and Sertoli cells that form testicular barriers, establishing reservoirs that enable viral dissemination. ZIKV persistence requires inhibiting interferon (IFN) responses that direct viral clearance. We found that ZIKV induces IFN-{beta} and IFN-{lambda} in hBMECs but post-transcriptionally inhibits IFN-{beta}/{lambda} expression. IFN{beta}/{lambda} mRNAs contain AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3 untranslated regions which regulate protein expression through interactions with ARE binding proteins (ARE-BPs). We found that ZIKV infection of primary hBMECs induces the expression of the ARE-BP tristetraprolin (TTP) and that TTP is a novel regulator of endothelial IFN secretion. In hBMECs, TTP knockout (KO) increased IFN-{beta}/{lambda}1 mRNA abundance and IFN-{beta}/{lambda}1 secretion in response to ZIKV infection and inhibited viral persistence. In contrast, TTP expression dramatically reduced IFN-{beta}/{lambda}1 secretion in hBMECs. IFN-{beta}/{lambda}1 mRNA stability was not significantly altered by TTP and is consistent with TTP inhibition of IFN-{beta}/{lambda}1 translation. TTP is similarly induced by ZIKV infection of Sertoli cells, and like hBMECs, TTP expression or KO inhibited or enhanced IFN-{beta}/{lambda} mRNA levels, respectively. These findings reveal a mechanism for ZIKV induced TTP to promote viral persistence in hBMECs and Sertoli cells by post-transcriptionally regulating IFN-{beta}/{lambda} secretion. Our results demonstrate a novel role for virally induced TTP in regulating IFN secretion in barrier cells that normally restrict viral persistence and spread to protected compartments.\n\nImportanceOur findings define a novel role for ZIKV induced TTP expression in regulating IFN-{beta}/{lambda} production in primary hBMECs and Sertoli cells. These cells comprise key physiological barriers subverted by ZIKV to access brain and testicular compartments and serve as reservoirs for persistent replication and dissemination. We demonstrate for the first time that the ARE binding protein TTP is virally induced and post-transcriptionally regulates IFN-{beta}/{lambda} secretion. In ZIKV infected hBMEC and Sertoli cells, TTP knockout increased IFN-{beta}/{lambda} secretion, while TTP expression blocked IFN-{beta}/{lambda} secretion. The TTP directed blockade of IFN secretion permits ZIKV spread and persistence in hBMECs and Sertoli cells and may similarly augment ZIKV spread across IFN-{lambda} protected placental barriers. Our work highlights the importance of post-transcriptional ZIKV regulation of IFN expression and secretion in cells that regulate viral access to protected compartments and defines a novel mechanism of ZIKV regulated IFN responses which facilitate neurovirulence and sexual transmission.",

We show that Pirh2 and KLHDC10 directly bind to Ala-tails, and structural predictions identify candidate Ala-tail binding sites, which we experimentally validate. The degron-binding pockets and specific pocket residues implicated in Ala-tail recognition are conserved among Pirh2 and KLHDC10 homologs, suggesting that an important function of these ligases across eukaryotes is in targeting Ala-tailed substrates. Moreover, we establish that the two Ala-tail binding pockets have convergently evolved, either from an ancient module of bacterial provenance (Pirh2) or via tinkering of a widespread C-degron recognition element (KLHDC10). These results shed light on the recognition of a simple degron sequence and the evolution of Ala-tail proteolytic signaling.",

    "abstract": "RationaleVascular calcification and increased extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness are hallmarks of vascular ageing. Sox9 (SRY-Box Transcription Factor 9) is a master regulator of chondrogenesis, also expressed in the vasculature, that has been implicated in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) osteo-chondrogenic conversion.\n\nObjectiveHere, we investigated the relationship between vascular ageing, calcification and Sox9-driven ECM regulation in VSMCs.\n\nMethods and ResultsImmunohistochemistry in human aortic samples showed that Sox9 was not spatially associated with vascular calcification but correlated with the senescence marker p16. Analysis of Sox9 expression in vitro showed it was mechanosensitive with increased expression and nuclear translocation in senescent cells and on stiff matrices. Manipulation of Sox9 via overexpression and depletion, combined with atomic force microscopy (AFM) and proteomics, revealed that Sox9 regulates ECM stiffness and organisation by orchestrating changes in collagen expression and reducing VSMC contractility, leading to the formation of an ECM that mirrored that of senescent cells. These ECM changes promoted phenotypic modulation of VSMCs whereby senescent cells plated onto ECM synthesized from cells depleted of Sox9 returned to a proliferative state, while proliferating cells on a matrix produced by Sox9 expressing cells showed reduced proliferation and increased DNA damage, reiterating features of senescent cells. Procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 3 (LH3) was identified as a Sox9 target, and key regulator of ECM stiffness. LH3 is packaged into extracellular vesicles (EVs) and Sox9 promoted EV secretion, leading to increased LH3 deposition within the ECM.\n\nConclusionsThese findings identify cellular senescence and Sox9 as a key regulators of ECM stiffness during VSMC ageing and highlight a crucial role for ECM structure and composition in regulating VSMC phenotype. We identify a positive feedback cycle whereby cellular senescence and increased ECM stiffening promote Sox9 expression which drives further ECM modifications that act to accelerate vascular stiffening and cellular senescence.",

    "abstract": "Most eukaryotic genes have been vertically transmitted to the present from distant ancestors. However, variable gene number across species indicates that gene gain and loss also occurs. While new genes typically originate as products of duplications and rearrangements of pre-existing genes, putative de novo genes - genes born out of previously non-genic sequence - have been identified. Previous studies of de novo genes in Drosophila have provided evidence that expression in male reproductive tissues is common. However, no studies have focused on female reproductive tissues. Here we begin addressing this gap in the literature by analyzing the transcriptomes of three female reproductive tract organs (spermatheca, seminal receptacle, and parovaria) in three species - our focal species, D. melanogaster - and two closely related species, D. simulans and D. yakuba, with the goal of identifying putative D. melanogaster-specific de novo genes expressed in these tissues. We discovered several candidate genes, which, consistent with the literature, tend to be short, simple, and lowly expressed. We also find evidence that some of these genes are expressed in other D. melanogaster tissues and both sexes. The relatively small number of candidate genes discovered here is similar to that observed in the accessory gland, but substantially fewer than that observed in the testis.",

    "abstract": "There has been considerable progress in the development of computational methods for designing protein-protein interactions, but engineering high-affinity binders without extensive screening and maturation remains challenging. Here, we test a protein design pipeline that uses iterative rounds of deep learning (DL)-based structure prediction (AlphaFold2) and sequence optimization (ProteinMPNN) to design autoinhibitory domains (AiDs) for a PD-L1 antagonist. Inspired by recent advances in therapeutic design, we sought to create autoinhibited (or masked) forms of the antagonist that can be conditionally activated by proteases. Twenty-three de novo designed AiDs, varying in length and topology, were fused to the antagonist with a protease sensitive linker, and binding to PD-L1 was tested with and without protease treatment. Nine of the fusion proteins demonstrated conditional binding to PD-L1 and the top performing AiDs were selected for further characterization as single domain proteins. Without any experimental affinity maturation, four of the AiDs bind to the PD-L1 antagonist with equilibrium dissociation constants (KDs) below 150 nM, with the lowest KD equal to 0.9 nM. Our study demonstrates that DL-based protein modeling can be used to rapidly generate high affinity protein binders.\n\nSignificance statementProtein-protein interactions are critical to most processes in biology, and improved methods for designing protein binders will enable the creation of new research reagents, diagnostics, and therapeutics.

    "abstract": "Results from data on > 1000 haplotypes distributed over a nine-year period from a natural population of the microcrustacean Daphnia pulex reveal evolutionary-genomic features at a refined scale, including key population-genetic properties that are obscured in studies with smaller sample sizes. Background selection, resulting from the recurrent introduction of dele-terious alleles, appears to strongly influence the dynamics of neutral alleles, inducing indirect negative selection on rare variants and positive selection on common variants. Fluctuating selection increases the persistence of nonsynonymous alleles with intermediate frequencies, while reducing standing levels of variation at linked silent sites. Combined with the results from an equally large metapopulation survey of the study species, regions of gene structure that are under strong purifying selection and classes of genes that are under strong positive selection in this key species can be confidently identified. Most notable among rapidly evolving Daph-nia genes are those associated with ribosomes, mitochondrial functions, sensory systems, and lifespan determination.",
