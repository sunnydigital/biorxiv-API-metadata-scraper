    "abstract": "Long-timescale behavior of proteins is fundamental to many biological processes. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and biophysical experiments are often used to study protein dynamics. However, high computational demands of MD limit what timescales are feasible to study, often missing rare events, which are critical to explain experiments. On the other hand, experiments are limited by low resolution. We present dynamic Augmented Markov models (dynAMMo) to bridge the gap between these data and overcome their respective limitations. For the first time, dynAMMo enables the construction of mechanistic models of slow exchange processes that have been not observed in MD data by integrating dynamic experimental observables. As a consequence, dynAMMo allows us to bypass costly and extensive simulations, yet providing mechanistic insights of the system. Validated with controlled model systems and a well-studied protein, dynAMMo offers a new approach to quantitatively model protein dynamics on long timescales in an unprecedented manner.",

    "abstract": "The marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is a main contributor to global photosynthesis, whilst being limited by iron availability. Cyanobacterial genomes typically encode two different types of FutA iron binding proteins: periplasmic FutA2 ABC transporter subunits bind Fe(III), while cytosolic FutA1 binds Fe(II). Owing to their small size and their economized genome Prochlorococcus ecotypes typically possess a single futA gene. How the encoded FutA protein might bind different Fe oxidation states was previously unknown. Here we use structural biology techniques at room temperature to probe the dynamic behavior of FutA. Neutron diffraction confirmed four negatively charged tyrosinates, that together with a neutral water molecule coordinate iron in trigonal bipyramidal geometry. Positioning of the positively charged Arg103 side chain in the second coordination shell yields an overall charge-neutral Fe(III) binding state in structures determined by neutron diffraction and serial femtosecond crystallography. Conventional rotation X-ray crystallography using a home source revealed X-ray induced photoreduction of the iron center with observation of the Fe(II) binding state; here, an additional positioning of the Arg203 side chain in the second coordination shell maintained an overall charge neutral Fe(II) binding site. Dose series using serial synchrotron crystallography and an XFEL X-ray pump-probe approach capture the transition between Fe(III) and Fe(II) states, revealing how Arg203 operates as a switch to accommodate the different iron oxidation states. This switching ability of the Prochlorococcus FutA protein may reflect ecological adaptation by genome streamlining and loss of specialized FutA proteins.",

    "abstract": "Atomistic resolution is considered the standard for high-resolution biomolecular structures, but coarse-grained models are often necessary to reflect limited experimental resolution or to achieve feasibility in computational studies. It is generally assumed that reduced representations involve a loss of detail, accuracy, and transferability. This study explores the use of advanced machine-learning networks to learn from known structures of proteins how to reconstruct atomistic models from reduced representations to assess how much information is lost when the vast knowledge about protein structures is taken into account. The main finding is that highly accurate and stereochemically realistic all-atom structures can be recovered with minimal loss of information from just a single bead per amino acid residue, especially when placed at the side chain center of mass. High-accuracy reconstructions with better than 1 [A] heavy atom root-mean square deviations are still possible when only C coordinates are used as input. This suggests that lower-resolution representations are essentially sufficient to represent protein structures when combined with a machine-learning framework that encodes knowledge from known structures. Practical applications of this high-accuracy reconstruction scheme are illustrated for adding atomistic detail to low-resolution structures from experiment or coarse-grained models generated from computational modeling. Moreover, a rapid, deterministic all-atom reconstruction scheme allows the implementation of an efficient multi-scale framework. As a demonstration, the rapid refinement of accurate models against cryoEM densities is shown where sampling at the coarse-grained level is guided by map correlation functions applied at the atomistic level. With this approach, the accuracy of standard all-atom simulation based refinement schemes can be matched at a fraction of the computational cost.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThe fundamental insight of this work is that atomistic detail of proteins can be recovered with minimal loss of information from highly reduced representations with just a single bead per amino acid residue. This is possible by encoding the existing knowledge about protein structures in a machine-learning model. This suggests that it is not strictly necessary to resolve structures in atomistic detail in experiments, computational modeling, or the generation of protein conformations via neural networks since atomistic details can inferred quickly via the neural network. This increases the relevance of experimental structures obtained at lower resolutions and broadens the impact of coarse-grained modeling.",

    "abstract": "Membrane fusion in vitro is a strategy to load model or cell-derived vesicles with proteins, drugs, and genetic materials for theranostic applications. It is thus crucial to develop strategies to control the fusion process, also through synthetic fusogenic agents. Ligand-protected, membrane-penetrating gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) can facilitate membrane fusion, but the molecular mechanisms remain unresolved. Here, we tackle NP-induced stalk formation using a coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics approach and enhanced sampling techniques. We show that smaller (2 nm in diameter) NPs lead to a lower free energy barrier and higher stalk stability than larger NPs (4 nm). We demonstrate that this difference is due to a different ligand conformational freedom, which in turn depends on the Au core curvature. Our study provides precious insights into the mechanisms underlying NP-mediated membrane fusion, while our computational approach is general and applicable to studying stalk formation caused by other fusogenic agents.\n\nTOC GRAPHICS\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=197 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/541080v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (93K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@137598forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d8c93eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@842de2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e08f44_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Ribosomes from plants have unique plant-specific features that may aid in rapid gene expression and regulation in response to changing environmental conditions due to their sessile nature. Here, we present high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of the 60S and 80S ribosomes from wheat, a monocot staple crop plant (Triticum aestivum). We compare wheat ribosome with closely related ribosomes from a dicot plant and other eukaryotes from yeast to humans. While plant ribosomes have unique plant-specific rRNA modification (Cm1847) in peptide exit tunnel, Zinc-finger motif in eL34 is absent and uL4 is extended making an exclusive interaction network. We note striking differences in eL15-Helix 11 (25S) interaction network, eL6-Expansion segment 7 assembly and certain rRNA chemical modifications between monocot and dicot ribosomes. Among eukaryotic ribosomes, we observe that rRNA modification (Gm75) in 5.8S rRNA is highly conserved and a base flipping (G1506) in peptide exit tunnel, and these features are likely involved in sensing nascent peptide. Finally, we discuss importance of universal conservation of three consecutive rRNA modifications in all ribosomes for their interaction with A-site aminoacyl-tRNA.",

    "abstract": "Streptophyte algae are the closest relatives of land plants and their latest common ancestor performed the most drastic adaptation that happened in plant evolution around 500 million years ago: the conquest of land. Beside other adaptations, this step required changes in cell wall composition. Today knowledge on cell walls of streptophyte algae and especially presence of arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs), which are important signaling molecules of all land plants, is limited. To get deeper insights in cell walls of streptophyte algae, especially of the Charophyceae, we performed sequential cell wall extractions of four Chara species. The three species Chara globularis, Chara subspinosa and Chara tomentosa revealed comparable cell wall compositions with pectins, xylans and xyloglucans, whereas Chara aspera was outstanding with higher amounts of uronic acids in the pectic fractions and lack of reactivity with antibodies binding to xylan- and xyloglucan epitopes. Search for AGPs in the four Chara species and also Nitellopsis obtusa revealed presence of galactans with pyranosidic galactose in 1,3-, 1,6- and 1,3,6-linkage, which are typical galactan motifs of land plant AGPs. A unique feature of these branched galactans were high portions of 3-O-methylgalactose. Only Nitellopsis contained substantial amounts of Ara. Bioinformatic search for prolyl-4-hydroxylase necessary for biosynthesis of AGPs revealed one possible functional sequence in the genome of Chara braunii, but no hydroxyproline could be detected in the four Chara species and Nitellopsis obtusa. We conclude that AGPs typical for land plants are absent at least in these members of the Charophyceae.",

    "abstract": "Volatiles emitted by herbivore-attacked plants (senders) can enhance defenses in neighboring plants (receivers), with important consequences for community dynamics. However, the temporal dynamics of this phenomenon remain poorly studied. Using a custom-built, high-throughput proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) system, we explored temporal patterns of volatile transfer and responses between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants. We found that continuous exposure to natural blends of herbivore-induced volatiles results in distinct temporal response patterns in neighboring plants, characterized by an induced terpene burst at the onset of the second day of exposure. This delayed burst is not explained by terpene accumulation during the night, but coincides with delayed jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants. The delayed burst occurs independent of day:night light transitions and cannot be fully explained by sender volatile dynamics. Instead, it is the result of a clocked stress memory from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary exposure to bioactive volatiles on the second day. Our study reveals that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volatiles results in a response that integrates priming and direct induction into a distinct and predictable temporal response pattern, with potentially important consequences for plant-herbivore dynamics and tritrophic interactions. This work also contributes to answering the long-standing question of whether stress volatiles predominantly induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring plants.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCommunity participation is a critical element in the management of Aedes breeding sites. Many educational interventions have been conducted to encourage prevention and elimination of breeding sites among different community actors, such as government-run programs for vector surveillance aimed at preventing and eliminating breeding sites at the household level within a community. Getting people involved in prevention and elimination of vector breeding sites in their communities requires communication and social mobilization strategies to promote and reinforce those prevention actions that, in turn, should be effective from the entomological standpoint.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsArticles published in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, were reviewed to assess whether educational interventions targeting Aedes were effective in reducing entomological indicators or in improving practices to prevent the presence of or eliminate breeding sites. The most widely used indicators were the larval indices, and the practices to reduce/eliminate breeding sites. We found that using a community-based approach adapted to the eco-epidemiological and sociocultural scenarios explain the reduction of entomological indicators by educational interventions.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThose who design or implement educational interventions should strengthen the evaluation of those interventions using qualitative approaches that provide a more complete picture of the social context and barriers/facilitators to implementing vector control. Engaging school children in cross-sectorial collaboration involving the health and education spheres promotes the participation of the community in vector surveillance and reduces the risk of arboviral disease transmission.\n\nAuthor summaryDengue, Zika, and chikungunya are mosquito-borne diseases that represent a major global public health problem. These diseases are transmitted mainly through the bite of the Aedes aegypti vector mosquito and, to a lesser extent, Ae. albopictus. Getting people involved in prevention and elimination of mosquitos in their communities requires communication and social mobilization strategies to promote and reinforce those prevention actions that, in turn, should be effective from the entomological standpoint. The success of vector control programs has been demonstrated to lie in a comprehensive effort involving key community participation and intersectoral alliances. In addition, the participation of schoolchildren to mobilize their families in the prevention of breeding sites and the management of mosquito populations is recommended. In this article, we proposed to conduct a systematic review of scientific publications that evaluate the effects of educational interventions on Aedes through entomological indicators. As a result, we obtained only 26 articles that evaluated the efficacy of educational interventions in reducing vector populations out of 732 articles reviewed. The selected articles were published in both English and Spanish, and to a lesser extent in Portuguese, which highlights the importance of avoiding language bias in systematic reviews. As a conclusion of our work, we can mention that the interventions that incorporated the social context and the barriers/facilitators for the implementation of vector control were the most successful. In addition, we emphasize the importance of involving schoolchildren to promote community participation in vector surveillance.",

    "abstract": "The relevance of plants as food is expected to grow for a more sustainable diet. In this new context, improving the nutritional quality of plant-derived foods is a must. Biofortification of green leafy vegetables with pro-vitamin A carotenoids such as {beta}-carotene has remained challenging to date. Here we combined two strategies to achieve this goal. One of them (that we call strategy C) involves producing {beta}-carotene in extraplastidial locations of leaf cells to avoid the negative impacts on photosynthesis derived from changing the balance of carotenoids and chlorophylls in chloroplasts. The second approach (that we refer to as strategy P) involves the conversion of chloroplasts into non-photosynthetic, carotenoid-overaccumulating chromoplasts in some leaves, leaving other non-engineered leaves to sustain normal plant growth. Combination of these two strategies resulted in a 5- fold increase in the amount of {beta}-carotene in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Following several attempts to further improve {beta}-carotene leaf contents by metabolic engineering, hormone treatments and genetic screenings, it was found that promoting the proliferation of plastoglobules with high-light treatments not only improved {beta}-carotene accumulation but it also resulted in a much higher bioaccessibility. Combination of strategies C and P together with a high-light treatment increased the levels of accessible {beta}-carotene 30-fold compared to controls. We further demonstrate that stimulating plastoglobule proliferation with strategy P but also with high-light alone can also stimulate and hence improve {beta}-carotene contents and bioaccessibility in edible lettuce (Lactuca sativa) leaves, unveiling the power of non-GMO approaches for leaf biofortification.",

    "abstract": "Cell polarity - broadly defined as the asymmetric distribution of cellular activities and or subcellular components within a cell - determines the geometry of cell growth and division during development. RHO GTPase proteins regulate the establishment of cell polarity and are conserved among eukaryotes. RHO Of Plant (ROP) proteins are a subgroup of RHO GTPases that are required for cellular morphogenesis in plants. However, how ROP proteins modulate the geometry of cell growth and division during the morphogenesis of plant tissues and organs is not well understood. To investigate how ROP proteins function during tissue development and organogenesis, we characterised the function of the single copy ROP gene of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. M. polymorpha develops morphologically complex three-dimensional tissues and organs exemplified by air chambers and gemmae, respectively. Mprop loss of function mutants form defective air chambers and gemmae, indicating ROP function is required for tissue development and organogenesis. During air chamber and gemma development in wild-type, the MpROP protein is enriched to sites of polarised growth at the cell surface and accumulates at the expanding cell plate of dividing cells. Consistent with these observations, polarised cell growth is lost, and cell divisions are misoriented in Mprop mutants. We propose that ROP regulates both polarised cell growth and cell division orientation in a coordinated manner to orchestrate tissue development and organogenesis in land plants.",

We searched for a direct Cd action on the photosynthetic electron transport chain using induced chlorophyll fluorescence and P700 light absorption. Young barley and maize plants were treated with Cd in toxic (80 M) and nearly lethal (250 M) concentrations. The maximal and relative photochemical activities of PSI, its major limitation at the donor side, and partially acceptor-side limitation of PSII changed in agreement with Cd accumulation in the corresponding chloroplasts. Probably, acceptor-side limitation of PSII increased with a direct Cd action under 80 M that was overcome with an indirect Cd action under 250 M. These alterations can be explained by Cd/Cu substitution in plastocyanin. The photochemical and non-photochemical quenching by PSII varied diversely that cannot be explained unambiguously by any mechanism. The limitations of PSI (Y(ND), Y(NA)) and PSII (qC) were compared for the first time. They were ranged as follows: Y(NA) < qC < Y(ND). Short segments of qC and Y(ND) dynamics varied proportionally to each other.

    "abstract": "Many insects have evolved the ability to manipulate plant growth to generate extraordinary structures called galls in which insect larva can develop while being sheltered within and feeding on the plant. In particular, Cynipid (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) wasps have evolved to form some of the most morphologically complex galls known and generate an astonishing array of gall shapes, colors, and sizes. However, the biochemical basis underlying these remarkable cellular and developmental transformations remains poorly understood. A key determinant in plant cellular development is the deposition of the cell wall to dictate the physical form and physiological function of newly developing cells, tissues, and organs. However, it is unclear to what degree cell walls are restructured to initiate and support the formation of new gall tissue. Here, we characterize the molecular alterations underlying gall development using a combination of metabolomic, histological, and biochemical techniques to elucidate how leaf cells are reprogrammed to form galls. Strikingly, gall development involves an exceptionally coordinated spatial deposition of lignin and xylan to form de novo gall vasculature. Our results highlight how Cynipid wasps can radically change the metabolite profile and restructure the cell wall to enable the formation of galls, providing new insights into the mechanism of gall induction and the extent to which plants can be entirely reprogrammed to form novel structures and organs.",

    "abstract": "Priming is a general term for a phenomenon in which exposure to an early environmental stimulus results in a more rapid or vigorous response when the plant is exposed to subsequent challenges. Various types of priming have been described:  systemic acquired resistance against biotic stimuli,  epigenetic stress memory induced by repeated abiotic stimuli, and  seed priming treatments which apply water and additional adjuncts to seeds to improve crop performance. Using a high-throughput chemical genomic approach, thousands of small molecules were screened to identify compounds capable of  chemical priming, asking if these could serve as artificial environments to persistently induce altered response to later abiotic challenges when applied as seed treatments. Attenuation of expected visual anthocyanin accumulation was chosen as a screening phenotype due to the visual nature of these pigments, as well as their biological roles in development and stress response. Several novel structural categories of molecules were identified that had the ability to reduce total anthocyanin accumulation in 7-18-day old seedlings induced by later low temperature challenge, persisting days after the removal of the compounds. Application variables were explored with thought to future use of the priming compounds as functional treatments: a dose-dependent relationship was established, additional effects on growth and development were documented to ensure minimal detrimental side effects on the treated plants, and the necessary temporal window of treatment was explored and reduced. Cross testing of the priming treatments identified by low temperature screening for ability to reduce anthocyanin induction by alternative exogenous and endogenous conditions showed consistent attenuative effect and revealed that the effect of priming on this metabolic phenotype was not specific to low temperature response. The presented research represents a proof-of-concept for the functional potential of seed priming with novel compounds, and highlights anthocyanin accumulation as a flexible component of plant stress response.",

    "abstract": "Soybean cyst nematodes (SCN, Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) are a significant threat to soybean production globally, causing severe yield losses and necessitating the development of effective strategies to combat this devastating nematode disease. This study presents dual RNA-seq analyses of the three most common SCN-resistant lines (Plant Introduction (PI) 437654, 548402, and 88788) and the susceptible line Lee74 against the SCN HG type 1.2.5.7 to identify the mechanisms of resistance and virulence genes involved in resistance breakdown. Transcriptomic and pathway analyses reveal the activation of the phenylpropanoid pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, plant hormone signal transduction, and secondary metabolite pathways in the resistance mechanisms. PI 437654, which exhibited robust resistance (female index, FI=0%), demonstrated unique gene expression associated with cell wall reinforcement, oxidative enzymes, ROS scavengers, and Ca+2 sensors governing the salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis process, indicating its key defense mechanism. Moreover, using different hosts with varying levels of immunity and a susceptible line provided insights into SCN pathogenesis and how H. glycine overcomes different layers of host immunity by modulating its virulence genes. This research provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying soybean-SCN interactions and identifies potential targets for developing strategies to manage this devastating nematode disease.",

    "abstract": "MADS genes encode transcription factors that act as master regulators of plant reproduction and flower development. The SEPALLATA (SEP) subfamily is required for the development of floral organs and plays roles in inflorescence architecture and development of the floral meristem. The SEPALLTAs act as organizers of MADS complexes, forming both heterodimers and heterotetramers in vitro. To date, the MADS complexes characterized in angiosperm floral organ development contain at least one SEPALLATA protein. Whether DNA-binding by SEPALLATA-containing dimeric MADS complexes are sufficient for launching floral organ identity programs, however, is not clear as only defects in floral meristem determinacy were observed in tetramerization impaired SEPALLATA mutants. Here, we used a combination of genome-wide binding studies, high resolution structural studies of the SEP3/AGAMOUS tetramerization domain, structure-based mutagenesis and complementation experiments in sep1 sep2 sep3 and sep1 sep2 sep3 ag-4 plants transformed with versions of SEP3 encoding tetramerization mutants. We demonstrate that while SEP3 heterodimers are able to bind DNA both in vitro and in vivo and recognize the majority of SEP3 wild type binding sites genome-wide, tetramerization is not only required for floral meristem determinacy, but also absolutely required for floral organ identity in the second, third and fourth whorls.",

    "abstract": "Unknown to many, the Philippines is host to a few remaining accessions of the underutilized and understudied cereal foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.). We collected together accessions from different eco-geographical locations within the Philippines, along with a few accessions from Lanyu, Taiwan, to undertake a study of the nutritional value and genetic diversity within accessions of foxtail millet grown in the Philippines. All accessions were field grown in 2022, dry season (DS) at the Institute of Plant Breeding (IPB) Experiment Station, Los Banos, Laguna, Philippines. The accessions were tested for micronutrients, including Zn and Fe, nitrogen as a proxy for protein, {beta}-carotene and a number of phenolic compounds with known nutritional potential. Of the 20 accessions tested, the accessions Bayaras and GB61438 had the highest level of Zn (107.1 mg/kg) and Fe (70.52 mg/kg), respectively, higher than levels found in traditional rice varieties. For {beta}-carotene the highest concentration was found in the accession Balles ([~]10{micro}g/g). Twelve phenolic compounds were detected, with catechin, syringic acid, ferulic acid and kaempferol having the highest concentrations and greatest variation between accessions. To assess the genetic diversity of these local foxtail millet accessions, we sequenced a core set of eight accessions to a depth of at least 25-fold. Analysis of the population structure, using genome-wide, high-quality SNPs, showed modest diversity among the accession, with two unadmixed groups. The accessions are monophyletic relative to their earliest common ancestor, with the very light brown accessions emerging earlier than the light brown and reddish-brown varieties. Analysis of Zinc/Iron permease (ZIP) transporters within the foxtail millet reference sequence, var. Yugu1 identified 17 putative ZIP transporters. Variant calling identified SNPs primarily within 3 and 5 regions, and introns, indicating variation between foxtail millet accessions within regulatory gene regions rather than in structural proteins. The local foxtail millet accessions found across the Philippines, therefore, represent a potential alternative source of nutrition that would help to address the problems of the double-burden of malnutrition found in the Philippines.",

    "abstract": "Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) mediates epigenetic silencing of target genes in animals and plants. In Arabidopsis, PRC2 is required for the cold-induced epigenetic silencing of the FLC floral repressor locus to align flowering with spring. During this process, PRC2 relies on VEL accessory factors, including the constitutively expressed VRN5 and the cold-induced VIN3. The VEL proteins are physically associated with PRC2, but their individual functions remain unclear. Here, we show an intimate association between recombinant VRN5 and multiple components within a reconstituted PRC2, dependent on a compact conformation of VRN5 central domains. Key residues mediating this compact conformation are conserved amongst VRN5 orthologs across the plant kingdom. By contrast, VIN3 interacts with VAL1, a transcriptional repressor that binds directly to FLC. These associations differentially affect their role in H3K27me deposition: both proteins are required for H3K27me3, but only VRN5 is necessary for H3K27me2. Although originally defined as vernalization regulators, VIN3 and VRN5 co-associate with many targets in the Arabidopsis genome that are modified with H3K27me3. Our work, therefore, reveals the distinct accessory roles for VEL proteins in conferring cold-induced silencing on FLC, with broad relevance for PRC2 targets generally.",

This study takes the representative streets in the main urban area of Zhongshan City, Guangdong Province as an example to explore urban street greening perception from the perspective of combining Green visual index (GVI) and Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This study uses a deep learning based image semantic segmentation method to analyze Baidu Street View to calculate the GVI of the street, and uses GF-1 satellite data to calculate NDVI to compare and analyze the characteristics and correlation of GVI and NDVI of urban streets. The results show that: 1. The GVI of streets in the central urban area of Zhongshan varies from 8.06% to 36.00%, with Xingzhong Road in Shiqi District Street having the highest GVI; 2. The mean value of NDVI of each street shows different changes with the increase of buffer scale, and the mean value of NDVI has a strong scale sensitivity; 3. The highest Pearson correlation coefficient between GVI and 25m DNVI mean value was 0.862; 4. The GVI prediction model based on NDVI is: y=0.8249x+0.0181, R2=0.7433. On this basis, the shortcomings of street landscape are analyzed and optimization suggestions are given, providing reference for urban street landscape evaluation, spatial optimization, and landscape improvement.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between sensory stimuli and perceptions is brain-state dependent: in wakefulness stimuli evoke perceptions; under anesthesia perceptions are abolished; during dreaming and in dissociated states, percepts are internally generated. Here, we exploit this state dependence to identify brain activity associated with internally generated or stimulus-evoked perception. In awake mice, visual stimuli phase reset spontaneous cortical waves to elicit 3-6 Hz feedback traveling waves. These stimulus-evoked waves traverse the cortex and entrain visual and parietal neurons. Under anesthesia and during ketamine-induced dissociation, visual stimuli do not disrupt spontaneous waves. Uniquely in the dissociated state, spontaneous waves traverse the cortex caudally and entrain visual and parietal neurons, akin to stimulus-evoked waves in wakefulness. Thus, coordinated neuronal assemblies orchestrated by traveling cortical waves emerge in states in which perception can manifest. The awake state is privileged in that this coordination is elicited by specifically by external visual stimuli.",

Here, we identify neuroanatomical and developmental factors that influence the real-time integration of stereotypes and factual evidence during live social interactions. The study uses precisely quantified communicative exchanges in a longitudinal cohort of seventeen-year-olds followed since infancy, testing their ability to moderate stereotype tendencies toward children as contrary evidence accumulates. Our results reveal that the impact of stereotypes on communicative behavior is linked to individual variation in the right anterior cingulate gyrus. In contrast, the ability to moderate stereotype tendencies is influenced by early-life exposure to social interactions, beyond the effects of familial environment and social experiences acquired later in life. These findings pinpoint a key brain structure underlying stereotype tendencies and suggest that early-life social experiences have lasting consequences on how individuals integrate factual evidence during interpersonal communication.",

    "abstract": "The Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in Brazil between 2015 and 2016 was associated with an increased prevalence of severe congenital malformations, including microcephaly. Notably, the distribution of microcephaly cases was not uniform across the country, with a disproportionately higher incidence recorded in the Northeast region (NE). Our previous work demonstrated that saxitoxin (STX), a toxin ubiquitously present in the drinking water reservoirs of the NE, exacerbated the damaging effects of ZIKV on the developing brain. In the present study, we hypothesized that STXs impact might vary among different neural cell types. Our experimental observations suggest that exposure to STX potentiates the neurotoxic effect of Zika Virus (ZIKV) on human neuronal cells. However, while ZIKV infection demonstrated severe impacts on astrocytes and neural stem cells (NSCs), the addition of STX did not exacerbate these effects. We observed that neurons subjected to STX exposure were more prone to apoptosis and displayed a higher number of ZIKV-infected cells. These findings suggest that STX exacerbates the harmful effects of ZIKV on neurons, thereby providing a plausible explanation for the heightened severity of ZIKV-induced congenital malformations observed in Brazils NE. This study underscores the importance of understanding the interactive effects of environmental toxins and infectious pathogens on neural development, with potential implications for public health policies and interventions.",

While SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are highly protective against severe COVID-19 disease, they do not protect against other sarbecoviruses or merbecoviruses. Here, we vaccinate mice with a trivalent sortase-conjugate nanoparticle (scNP) vaccine containing the SARS-CoV-2, RsSHC014, and MERS-CoV receptor binding domains (RBDs), which elicited live-virus neutralizing antibody responses and broad protection. Specifically, a monovalent SARS-CoV-2 RBD scNP vaccine only protected against sarbecovirus challenge, whereas the trivalent RBD scNP vaccine protected against both merbecovirus and sarbecovirus challenge in highly pathogenic and lethal mouse models. Moreover, the trivalent RBD scNP elicited serum neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 BA.1 live viruses.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are key components of innate immunity across all kingdoms of life. Both natural and synthetic AMPs are receiving renewed attention in the efforts to combat the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis and the loss of antibiotic efficacy. The gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most concerning infectious bacteria in AMR, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) where respiratory infections are difficult to eradicate and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Cationic AMPs exploit the negative charge of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on P. aeruginosa to bind to and disrupt the bacterial membrane(s) and cause lethal damage. P. aeruginosa modifies its LPS, via environmental or genetic factors, to neutralise the charge of the cell and evade AMP killing. Free-LPS is also a component of CF sputum, as is anionic extracellular DNA (eDNA), each of which can bind AMPs by electrostatic interaction. Both free LPS and eDNA also feed into pro-inflammatory cycles. Glatiramer acetate (GA) is a random peptide co-polymer of glycine, lysine, alanine, and tyrosine and used as drug in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS); we have previously shown GA to be an AMP which synergises with tobramycin against P. aeruginosa from CF, functioning via bacterial membrane disruption. Here, we demonstrate direct binding and sequestration/neutralisation of P. aeruginosa LPS in keeping with GAs ability to disrupt the outer membrane. Binding and neutralisation of eDNA was also seen. At CF-relevant concentrations, however, neither strongly inhibited membrane disruption by GA. Furthermore, in both type strains and clinical CF isolates of P. aeruginosa, exposure to GA did not result in increased modification of the Lipid A portion of LPS or in increased expression of genetically encoded systems involved in AMP sensing and LPS modification. With this low selective pressure on P. aeruginosa for known AMP resistance mechanisms, the potential to neutralise pro-inflammatory CF sputum components, as well as the previously described enhancement of antibiotic function, GA is a promising candidate for drug repurposing.",

Migratory birds are among the most well-studied animals on Earth, yet relatively little is known about in-flight behavior during nocturnal migration. Because many migrating bird species vocalize during flight, passive acoustic monitoring shows great promise for facilitating widespread monitoring of bird migration.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we present Nighthawk, a deep learning model designed to detect and identify the vocalizations of nocturnally migrating birds. We trained Nighthawk on the in-flight vocalizations of migratory birds using a diverse dataset of recordings from across the Americas.\nC_LIO_LIOur results demonstrate that Nighthawk performs well as a nocturnal flight call detector and classifier for dozens of avian taxa, both at the species level and for broader taxonomic groups (e.g., orders and families). The model accurately quantified nightly nocturnal migration intensity and species phenology and performed well on data from across North America. Incorporating modest amounts of additional annotated audio (50-120 h) into model training yielded high performance on target datasets from both North and South America.\nC_LIO_LIBy monitoring the vocalizations of actively migrating birds, Nighthawk provides a detailed window onto nocturnal bird migration that is not presently attainable by other means (e.g., radar or citizen science). Scientists, managers, and practitioners could use acoustic monitoring with Nighthawk for a number of applications, including: monitoring migration passage at wind farms; studying airspace usage during migratory flights; monitoring the changing migrations of species susceptible to climate change; and revealing previously unknown migration routes and behaviors. Overall, this work will empower diverse stakeholders to efficiently monitor migrating birds across the Western Hemisphere and collect data in aid of science and conservation.

    "abstract": "Heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense with climate change, but the demographic and evolutionary consequences of heatwaves are rarely investigated in herbaceous plant species. We examine the consequences of a short but extreme heatwave in Oregon populations of the common yellow monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus) by leveraging a common garden experiment planted with range-wide populations and observational studies of eleven local populations. In the common garden, 89% of seedlings died during the heatwave including >96% of seedlings from geographically-local populations. Some populations from hotter and drier environments had higher fitness, however others from comparable environments performed poorly. Observational studies of local natural populations drastically differed in the consequences of the heatwave - one population was completely extirpated and nearly half had a >50% decrease in fitness. However, a few populations had greater fitness during the heatwave year. Differences in mortality corresponded to the impact of the heatwave on soil moisture - retention of soil moisture throughout the heatwave led to greater survivorship. Our results suggest that not all populations experience the same intensity or degree of mortality during extreme events and such heterogeneity could be important for genetic rescue or to facilitate the distribution of adaptive variants throughout the region.",

    "abstract": "Ageing is driven by the accumulation of diverse types of damage that leads to a decline in function over time. In unicellular organisms, in addition to this damage accumulation within individuals, asymmetric partitioning of damage at cell division might also play a crucial role in shaping demographic ageing patterns. Despite empirical single-cell studies providing quantitative data at the molecular and demographic level, a comprehensive understanding of how cellular damage production and partition propagate and influence demographic patterns is still lacking. To address this gap, we present a generic and flexible damage model using a stochastic differential equation approach which incorporates stochastic damage accumulation and asymmetric damage partitioning at cell divisions. We provide an analytical approximation linking cellular and damage parameters to demographic ageing patterns. Interestingly, we observe that the lifespan of the cells follows an inverse-gaussian distribution whose statistical properties can be expressed with cellular and damage parameters, as well as easily inferred from empirical single-cell data. Furthermore, we demonstrate how stochasticity (noise) in damage production and asymmetry in damage partitioning contribute to shaping lifespans. Applying the model to empirical E.coli data reveals non-exponential scaling in mortality rates, which cannot be captured by classical Gompertz-Makeham models. Additionally, we highlight the essential role of stochastic division times in shaping lifespans. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of how fundamental processes contribute to cellular damage dynamics and generate demographic patterns. The generic nature and flexibility of our damage model offer a valuable framework for investigating ageing in diverse biological systems.",

    "abstract": "In anaerobic Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures, NADH-cofactor balancing by glycerol formation constrains ethanol yields. Introduction of an acetate-to-ethanol reduction pathway based on heterologous acetylating acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (A-ALD) can replace glycerol formation as  redox-sink and improve ethanol yields in acetate-containing media. Acetate concentrations in feedstock for first-generation bioethanol production are, however, insufficient to completely replace glycerol formation. An alternative glycerol-reduction strategy bypasses the oxidative reaction in glycolysis by introducing phosphoribulokinase (PRK) and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO). For optimal performance in industrial settings, yeast strains should ideally first fully convert acetate and, subsequently, continue low-glycerol fermentation via the PRK-RuBisCO pathway. However, anaerobic batch cultures of a strain carrying both pathways showed inferior acetate reduction relative to a strain expressing only the A-ALD pathway. Complete A-ALD-mediated acetate reduction by a dual-pathway strain, grown anaerobically on 50 g L-1 glucose and 5 mmol L-1 acetate, was achieved upon reducing PRK abundance by a C-terminal extension of its amino-acid sequence. Yields of glycerol and ethanol on glucose were 55% lower and 6% higher, respectively, than those of a non-engineered reference strain. The negative impact of the PRK-RuBisCO pathway on acetate reduction was attributed to sensitivity of the reversible A-ALD reaction to intracellular acetaldehyde concentrations.",

    "abstract": "In the field of microbiome studies, it is of interest to infer correlations between abundances of different microbes (here referred to as operational taxonomic units, OTUs). Several methods taking the compositional nature of the sequencing data into account exist. However, these methods cannot infer correlations between OTU abundances and other variables. In this paper we introduce the methods SparCEV (Sparse Correlations with External Variables) and SparXCC (Sparse Cross-Correlations between Compositional data) for quantifying correlations between OTU abundances and either continuous phenotypic variables or components of other compositional datasets, such as transcriptomic data. We compare these new methods to empirical Pearson cross-correlations after applying naive transformations of the data (log and log-TSS). Additionally, we test the centered log ratio transformation (CLR) and the variance stabilising transformation (VST). We find that CLR and VST outperform naive transformations, except when the correlation matrix is dense. For large numbers of OTUs, SparCEV and SparXCC perform similarly to CLR and VST. SparCEV outperforms all other tested methods when the number of OTUs is small (less than 100). SparXCC outperforms all tested methods when at least one of the compositional datasets has few variables (less than 50), and more so when both datasets have few variables.\n\nAuthor summarySequencing data of the microbiome posses a unique and challenging structure that renders many standard statistical tools invalid. Features such as compositionality and sparsity complicates statistical analysis, and as a result, specialized tools are needed. Practitioners have long been interested in the construction of correlation networks within the microbiome, and several methods for accomplishing this exist. However, less attention has been paid to the estimation of cross-correlations between microbial abundances and other variables (such as gene expression data or environmental and phenotypic variables). Here, we introduce novel approaches, SparCEV and SparXCC, for inferring such cross-correlations, and compare these to transformation-based approaches, namely log, log-TSS, CLR and VST. In some cases, SparCEV and SparXCC yield superior results, while in other cases, a simpler transformation-based approach suffices. The methods are used to study cross-correlations between bacterial abundances in the skin microbiome and the severity of atopic dermatitis, as well as cross-correlations between fungal and bacterial OTUs in the root microbiome of the legume Lotus japonicus.",

    "abstract": "PurposePTEN loss-of-function/PI3K pathway hyperactivation occurs in [~]50% of metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients, resulting in poor therapeutic outcomes and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors across multiple malignancies. Our prior studies in prostate-specific PTEN/p53-deleted genetically engineered mice (Pb-Cre;PTENfl/flTrp53fl/fl GEM) with aggressive-variant prostate cancer (AVPC) demonstrated feedback Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling activation in 40% mice resistant to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)/PI3K inhibitor (PI3Ki)/PD-1 antibody (aPD-1) combination, resulting in restoration of lactate cross-talk between tumor-cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), histone lactylation (H3K18lac) and phagocytic suppression within TAM. Here, we targeted immunometabolic mechanism(s) of resistance to ADT/PI3Ki/aPD-1 combination, with the goal of durable tumor control in PTEN/p53-deficient PC.\n\nExperimental designPb-Cre;PTENfl/flTrp53fl/fl GEM were treated with either ADT (degarelix), PI3Ki (copanlisib), aPD-1, MEK inhibitor (trametinib) or Porcupine inhibitor (LGK 974) as single agents or their combinations. MRI was used to monitor tumor kinetics and immune/proteomic profiling/ex vivo co-culture mechanistic studies were performed on prostate tumors or established GEM-derived cell lines.\n\nResultsWe tested whether Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway inhibition with LGK 974 addition to degarelix/copanlisib/aPD-1 therapy enhances tumor control in GEM, and observed de novo resistance due to feedback activation of MEK signaling. Based on our observation that degarelix/aPD-1 treatment resulted in partial inhibition of MEK signaling, we substituted trametinib for degarelix/aPD-1 treatment, and observed a durable tumor growth control of PI3Ki/MEKi/PORCNi in 100% mice via H3K18lac suppression and complete TAM activation within TME.\n\nConclusionsAbrogation of lactate-mediated cross-talk between cancer cells and TAM results in durable ADT-independent tumor control in PTEN/p53-deficient AVPC, and warrants further investigation in clinical trials.\n\nSTATEMENT OF TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCEPTEN loss-of-function occurs in [~]50% of mCRPC patients, and associated with poor prognosis, and immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance across multiple malignancies. Our prior studies have demonstrated that ADT/PI3Ki/PD-1 triplet combination therapy controls PTEN/p53-deficient PC in 60% of mice via enhancement of TAM phagocytosis. Here, we discovered that resistance to ADT/PI3K/PD-1 therapy occurred via restoration of lactate production via feedback Wnt/MEK signaling following treatment with PI3Ki, resulting in inhibition of TAM phagocytosis. Critically, co-targeting of PI3K/MEK/Wnt signaling pathways using an intermittent dosing schedule of corresponding targeted agents resulted in complete tumor control and significantly prolonged survival without significant long-term toxicity. Collectively, our findings provide \"proof-of-concept\" that targeting lactate as a macrophage phagocytic checkpoint controls growth of murine PTEN/p53-deficient PC and warrant further investigation in AVPC clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that type II ryanodine receptors (RyR2) tetramers can be rapidly rearranged in response to a phosphorylation cocktail. The cocktail modified downstream targets indiscriminately making it impossible to determine whether phosphorylation of RyR2 was an essential element of the response. We therefore used the {beta}-agonist isoproterenol and mice with one of the homozygous mutations, S2030A+/+, S2808A+/+, S2814A+/+, or S2814D+/+, to address this question and to elucidate the role of these clinically relevant mutations. We measured the length of the dyad using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and directly visualized RyR2 distribution using dual-tilt electron tomography. We found that: 1) The S2814D mutation, by itself, significantly expanded the dyad and reorganized the tetramers suggesting a direct link between the phosphorylation state of the tetramer and the microarchitecture. 2) All of the wild-type, as well as the S2808A and S2814A mice, had significant expansions of their dyads in response to ISO, while S2030A did not. 3) In agreement with functional data from the same mutants, S2030 and S2808 were necessary for a complete {beta}-adrenergic response, whereas S2814 was not. 4) All the mutated residues had unique effects on the organization of their tetramer arrays. 5) The correlation of structure with function suggests that tetramer-tetramer contacts play an important functional role. We conclude that both the size of the dyad and the arrangement of the tetramers are linked to the state of the channel tetramer and can be dynamically altered by a {beta}-adrenergic receptor agonist.\n\nSummaryAnalysis of RyR2 mutants suggests a direct link between the phosphorylation state of the channel tetramer and the microarchitecture of the dyad.

    "abstract": "The Aspergillus fumigatus unfolded protein response (UPR) is a two-component relay consisting of the ER-bound IreA protein, which splices and activates the mRNA of the transcription factor HacA. Spliced hacA accumulates under conditions of acute ER stress in vitro, and UPR null mutants are hypovirulent in a murine model of invasive pulmonary infection. In this report, we demonstrate that a hacA deletion mutant is completely unable to establish infection in a model of fungal keratitis, a corneal infection and an important cause of ocular morbidity and unilateral blindness worldwide. Contrary to our initial prediction, however, we demonstrate that hacA splicing is not increased above baseline conditions in the cornea, nor is the expression of genes classically associated with UPR activation, such as protein chaperones. We employed transcriptomics on wild-type and{Delta} hacA strains in gelatin media, as a proxy for the corneal environment, and found that hacA supports the expression of numerous primary and secondary metabolic processes that likely promote adaptation to nutrient limitation. Taken together, our results support a model in which the cornea, similar to growth on protein in vitro, is a source of sub-acute ER stress for A. fumigatus, but one nevertheless that requires the UPR pathway for proper adaptation. The data also suggest that this pathway could be a target for novel antifungals that improve visual outcomes for fungal keratitis patients.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYFungal keratitis has emerged as a leading cause of ocular morbidity and unilateral blindness worldwide. Relative to other infectious contexts, however, little is known about the fungal genes or pathways that regulate invasive growth and virulence in the corneal environment. In this report, we demonstrate that genetic disruption of the Aspergillus fumigatus unfolded protein response (UPR) abolishes the ability of the mold to establish infection in a mouse model of FK. Despite this critical role for virulence, however, we did not detect a concerted activation of the pathway beyond levels observed on standard medium, suggesting that the host environment is not an acute source of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Transcriptomic profiling of the wild-type and UPR-deficient strains under host-relevant nutrient conditions revealed a critical role for the pathway in regulating primary and secondary metabolism, cell wall biology, and mitochondrial function, all of which likely modulate fungal growth within and interactions with the host. These results expand our understanding of UPR regulation and function in this important mold pathogen and suggest the pathway could serve as a target for novel antifungals that improve visual outcomes in the setting of fungal keratitis.",

    "abstract": "Lentiviral accessory genes enhance replication through diverse mechanisms. HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr modulates the host DNA damage response (DDR) at multiple steps through the degradation of host proteins, cell cycle arrest, DNA damage, and both activation and repression of DDR signaling. Vpr also alters host and viral transcription; however, the connection between Vpr-mediated DDR modulation and transcriptional activation remains unclear. Here, we determined the cellular consequences of Vpr-induced DNA damage using Vpr mutants that allow us to separate the ability of Vpr to induce DNA damage from CRL4ADCAF1 complex dependent phenotypes including cell cycle arrest, host protein degradation, and repression of DDR. In both tissue-cultured U2OS cells and primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), we found that Vpr induces DNA breaks and activates DDR signaling in the absence of cell cycle arrest and CRL4ADCAF1 complex engagement. Moreover, through RNA-sequencing, we found that Vpr-induced DNA damage alters cellular transcription via activation of NF-{kappa}B/RelA signaling. NF-{kappa}B/RelA transcriptional activation was dependent on ATM-NEMO, as inhibition of NEMO resulted in loss of NF-{kappa}B transcriptional upregulation by Vpr. Furthermore, HIV-1 infection of primary MDMs validated NF-{kappa}B transcriptional activation during infection. Both virion delivered and de novo expressed Vpr induced DNA damage and activated NF-{kappa}B transcription, suggesting that engagement of the DDR can occur during early and late stages of viral replication. Together, our data support a model where Vpr-induced DNA damage activates NF-{kappa}B through the ATM-NEMO pathway, independent of cell cycle arrest and CRL4ADCAF1 engagement. We propose this is essential to overcoming restrictive environments, such as macrophages, to enhance viral transcription and replication.",

    "abstract": "Climate change globally and sea level rise affect the mangrove ecosystem. The high diversity and temporal heterogeneity of the mangrove ecosystem will lead to a high diversity of sediment bacterial community structure and function. However, seasonal variations and potential assembly mechanisms of sediment bacterial communities in mangrove ecosystems remain to be discovered. We collected rhizosphere sediments and bulk sediments from Kandelia obovata and Aegiceras corniculatum at three locations covering Dongzhai Harbour in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and sequenced 16S rRNAs. The results indicated that the alpha and beta diversity of bacterial communities in mangrove sediments differed significantly between seasons, and the bacterial communities in rhizosphere sediments had smaller seasonal changes and were more stable than those in bulk sediment bacterial communities. The seasonal changes in carbon, nitrogen content, and pH were the main influencing factors. The stochastic process dominated the assembly of bacterial communities in mangrove sediments. The assembly of bacterial communities varies between seasons. We found that the proportion of dispersal limitation was significantly negatively correlated with the carbon and nitrogen content in the sediment. Compared with bulk components, the dispersal limitation of bacterial communities in rhizosphere sediments accounted for a lower proportion of community construction, which might be caused by higher carbon and nitrogen content conditions in rhizosphere sediments. We found that beta diversity based on Bray-Curtis distance was significantly positively correlated with dispersal limitation, which explained why the beta diversity of bacterial communities in rhizosphere sediments was significantly lower than that of bulk components. This study increases the understanding of the responses of mangrove bacterial communities to seasonal change and may be beneficial for the protection of mangrove ecosystems in the face of climate change.",

    "abstract": "Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are megaenzymes that form chemically diverse polyketides and are found within the genomes of nearly all classes of life. We recently discovered the type I PKS from the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, TgPKS2, which contains a unique putative chain release mechanism that includes ketosynthase (KS) and thioester reductase (TR) domains. Our bioinformatic analysis of the thioester reductase of TgPKS2, TgTR, suggests differences in putative apicomplexan reductase domains compared to other systems and hints at a possibly conserved release mechanism within the apicomplexan subclass Coccidia. To evaluate this release module, we first isolated TgTR and observed that it is capable of 4 electron (4e-) reduction of octanoyl-CoA to the primary alcohol, octanol, utilizing NADH as a cofactor. TgTR was also capable of generating octanol in the presence of octanal and NADH, but no reactions were observed when NADPH was supplied as a cofactor. To biochemically characterize the protein, we measured the catalytic efficiency of TgTR using a fluorescence assay and determined the TgTR binding affinity for cofactor and substrates using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). We additionally show that TgTR is capable of reducing an acyl carrier protein (ACP)-tethered substrate by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and determine that TgTR binds to holo-TgACP4, its predicted cognate ACP, with a KD of 5.75 {+/-} 0.77 {micro}M. Finally, our transcriptional analysis shows that TgPKS2 is upregulated [~]4-fold in the parasites cyst-forming bradyzoite stage compared to tachyzoites. Our study identifies features that distinguish TgPKS2 from well-characterized systems in bacteria and fungi, and suggests it aids the T. gondii cyst stage. Together, this work increases our knowledge of PKS thioester reductase domains and advances our understanding of unconventional polyketide chain termination mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The designability of orthogonal coiled coil (CC) dimers, which draw on well-established design rules, plays a pivotal role in fueling the development of CCs as synthetically versatile assembly-directing motifs for the fabrication of bionanomaterials. Here, we aim to expand the synthetic CC toolkit through establishing a \"minimalistic\" set of orthogonal, de novo CC peptides that comprise 3.5 heptads in length and a single buried Asn to prescribe dimer formation. The designed sequences display excellent partner fidelity, confirmed via circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and are corroborated in silico using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Detailed analysis of the MD conformational data highlights the importance of interhelical E@g-N@a interactions in coordinating an extensive 6-residue hydrogen bonding network that \"locks\" the interchain Asn-Asn contact in place. The enhanced stability imparted to the Asn-Asn bond elicits an increase in thermal stability of CCs up to [~]15{degrees}C and accounts for significant differences in stability within the collection of similarly designed orthogonal CC pairs. The presented work underlines the utility of MD simulation as a tool for constructing de novo, orthogonal CCs, and presents an alternative handle for modulating the stability of orthogonal CCs via tuning the number of interhelical E@g-N@a contacts. Expansion of CC design rules is a key ingredient for guiding the design and assembly of more complex, intricate CC-based architectures for tackling a variety of challenges within the fields of nanomedicine and bionanotechnology.",

    "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation is an integral part of many cellular processes, not only in eukaryotes but also in bacteria. The discovery of both prokaryotic protein kinases and phosphatases has created interest in generating antibacterial therapeutics that target these enzymes. NMA1982 is a putative phosphatase from Neisseria meningitidis, the causative agent of meningitis and meningococcal septicemia. The overall fold of NMA1982 closely resembles that of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). However, the hallmark C(X)5R PTP signature motif, containing the catalytic cysteine and invariant arginine, is shorter by one amino acid in NMA1982. This has cast doubt about the catalytic mechanism of NMA1982 and its assignment to the PTP superfamily. Here, we demonstrate that NMA1982 indeed employs a catalytic mechanism that is specific to PTPs. Mutagenesis experiments, transition state inhibition, pH-dependence activity, and oxidative inactivation experiments all support that NMA1982 is a genuine phosphatase. Importantly, we show that NMA1982 is secreted by N. meningitidis, suggesting that this protein is a potential virulence factor. Future studies will need to address whether NMA1982 is indeed essential for N. meningitidis survival and virulence. Based on its unique active site conformation, NMA1982 may become a suitable target for developing selective antibacterial drugs.",

    "abstract": "Human schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium, and S. japonicum. Praziquantel (PZQ) is the method of choice for treatment. Due to constant selection pressure, there is an urgent need for new therapies for schistosomiasis. Previous treatment of S. mansoni included the use of oxamniquine (OXA), a drug that is activated by a schistosome sulfotransferase (SULT). Guided by data from X-ray crystallography and Schistosoma killing assays more than 350 OXA derivatives were designed, synthesized, and tested. We were able to identify CIDD-0150610 and CIDD-0150303 as potent derivatives in vitro that kill (100%) of all three Schistosoma species at a final concentration of 71.5 {micro}M. We evaluated the efficacy of the best OXA derivates in an in vivo model after treatment with a single dose of 100 mg/kg by oral gavage. The highest rate of worm burden reduction was achieved by CIDD-150303 (81.8%) against S. mansoni, CIDD-0149830 (80.2%) against S. haematobium and CIDD-066790 (86.7%) against S. japonicum. We have also evaluated the ability of the derivatives to kill immature stages since PZQ does not kill immature schistosomes. CIDD-0150303 demonstrated (100%) killing for all life stages at a final concentration of 143 {micro}M in vitro and effective reduction in worm burden in vivo against S. mansoni. To understand how OXA derivatives fit in the SULT binding pocket, X-ray crystal structures of CIDD-0150303 and CIDD-0150610 demonstrate that the SULT active site will accommodate further modifications to our most active compounds as we fine tune them to increase favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Treatment with a single dose of 100 mg/kg by oral gavage with co-dose of PZQ + CIDD-0150303 reduced the worm burden of PZQ resistant parasites in an animal model by 90.8%. Therefore, we conclude that CIDD-0150303, CIDD-0149830 and CIDD-066790 are novel drugs that overcome some of PZQ limitations, and CIDD-0150303 can be used with PZQ in combination therapy.\n\nAuthor SummaryHuman schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic worms in the genus Schistosoma. Human schistosomiasis is caused mainly by three major species: S. mansoni, S. haematobium, and S. japonicum. It affects some 229 million people in 78 countries. Currently, there is no effective vaccine against human schistosomiasis. Praziquantel is the method of choice for treatment and evidence for drug resistance has been reported. Our focus is drug discovery for schistosomiasis. Our project team is designing, synthesizing, and testing reengineered derivatives of oxamniquine against the three human species of Schistosoma. The aim is to develop a new drug for schistosomiasis to overcome developing resistance and improve efficacy. We developed and identified compounds that kill all three human Schistosoma species in addition to a PZQ-resistant strain in animal models. Additionally, animal studies demonstrate that combination treatment of reengineered oxamniquine drugs and praziquantel effectively reduced the infection with a praziquantel resistant strain in infected mice.",

    "abstract": "Orthogonal translation systems (OTSs) are the most expedient way to generate unnatural proteins by adding non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) to the genetic code. Diversifying substrate specificity typically starts from a stable enzyme that is capable to withstand the structure-perturbing effects of the required mutations. We here take a radically different position, starting from an enzyme that has evolved to cope with instability and thus may better tolerate mutations. By engineering psychrophilic (\"cold\") PylRS orthologs we develop \"cold\" OTS as an alternative to the commonly used mesophilic and thermophilic OTSs. In particular, the psychrophilic PylRS homolog from Methanococcoides burtonii (MburPylRS) showed remarkable properties in terms of catalytic efficiency and promiscuity, even at very low ncAA concentrations. Outstanding multi-site incorporation efficiencies were achieved with N{varepsilon}-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-L-lysine (BocK) and especially S-allyl-L-cysteine in up to five sites. Given the broad range of host organisms (archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes) in which the system can be used, we anticipate that Cold-OTS will greatly facilitate the transformation of the expanded genetic code from an academic discipline into a high-value chemistry-driven biotechnology.",

    "abstract": "As living drugs, engineered T cell therapies are revolutionizing disease treatment with their unique functional capabilities. However, they suffer from limitations of potentially unpredictable behavior, toxicities, and non-traditional pharmacokinetics. Engineering conditional control mechanisms responsive to tractable stimuli such as small molecules or light is thus highly desirable. We and others previously developed \"universal\" chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that interact with co-administered antibody adaptors to direct target cell killing and T cell activation. Universal CARs are of high therapeutic interest due to their ability to simultaneously target multiple antigens on the same disease or different diseases by combining with adaptors to different antigens. Here, we further enhance the programmability and potential safety of universal CAR T cells by engineering OFF-switch adaptors that can conditionally control CAR activity, including T cell activation, target cell lysis, and transgene expression, in response to a small molecule or light stimulus. Moreover, in adaptor combination assays, OFF-switch adaptors were capable of orthogonal conditional targeting of multiple antigens simultaneously following Boolean logic. OFF-switch adaptors represent a robust new approach for precision targeting of universal CAR T cells with potential for enhanced safety.",

    "abstract": "Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites, remains one of the most devastating infectious diseases worldwide, despite control efforts that have lowered morbidity and mortality. The only P. falciparum vaccine candidates to show field efficacy are those targeting the asymptomatic pre-erythrocytic (PE) stages of infection. The subunit (SU) RTS,S/AS01 vaccine, the only licensed malaria vaccine to date, is only modestly effective against clinical malaria. Both RTS,S/AS01 and the SU R21 vaccine candidate target the PE sporozoite (spz) circumsporozoite (CS) protein. These candidates elicit high-titer antibodies that provide short-term protection from disease, but do not induce the liver-resident memory CD8+ T cells (Trm) that confer strong PE immunity and long-term protection. In contrast, whole-organism (WO) vaccines, employing for example radiation-attenuated spz (RAS), elicit both high antibody titers and Trm, and have achieved high levels of sterilizing protection. However, they require multiple intravenous (IV) doses, which must be administered at intervals of several weeks, complicating mass administration in the field. Moreover, the quantities of spz required present production difficulties. To reduce reliance on WO while maintaining protection via both antibodies and Trm responses, we have developed an accelerated vaccination regimen that combines two distinct agents in a prime-and-trap strategy. While the priming dose is a self-replicating RNA encoding P. yoelii CS protein, delivered via an advanced cationic nanocarrier (LIONTM), the trapping dose consists of WO RAS. This accelerated regime confers sterile protection in the P. yoelii mouse model of malaria. Our approach presents a clear path to late-stage preclinical and clinical testing of dose-sparing, same-day regimens that can confer sterilizing protection against malaria.",

    "abstract": "Quickly understanding the genomic changes that lead to pathogen emergence is necessary to launch mitigation efforts and reduce harm. Often the evolutionary events that result in an epidemic typically remain elusive long after an outbreak, which is particularly true for plant pathogens. To rapidly define the consequential evolutionary events result in pathogen emergence, we tracked in real-time a 2022 bacterial plant disease outbreak in US geranium (Pelargonium x hortorum) caused by Xhp2022, a novel lineage of Xanthomonas hortorum. Genomes from 31 Xhp2022 isolates from seven states showed limited chromosomal variation, and all contained a single plasmid (p93). Time tree and SNP whole genome analysis estimated that Xhp2022 emerged in the early 2020s. Phylogenomic analysis determined that p93 resulted from cointegration of three plasmids (p31, p45, and p66) present in a 2012 outbreak. p31, p45 and p66 were individually found in varying abundance across X. hortorum isolates from historical outbreaks dating to 1974 suggesting these plasmids were maintained in the broader metapopulation. p93 specifically arose from two co-integration events from homologous and Tn3 and XerC-mediated site-specific recombination. Although p93 suffered a 49kb nucleotide reduction, it maintained critical fitness gene functions encoding, for example, metal resistance and virulence factors, which were likely selected by the ornamental production system. Overall we demonstrate how rapid sequencing of current and historical isolates track the evolutionary history of an emerging, ongoing threat. We show a recent, tractable event of genome reduction for niche adaptation typically observed over millenia in obligate and fastidious pathogens.\n\nSignificanceGenome-resolved epidemiology is rapidly changing how we track pathogens in real-time to support stakeholders and health. This research highlights how we responded to a current disease outbreak of geranium. Our work revealed that a new group of the bacterial plant pathogen Xanthomonas horotrum emerged in 2022 as a result of a recent genome reduction. We determined that three distinct plasmids were present in the broader X. hortorum metapopulation since 1974. In 2012, the three plasmids were altogether present in individual isolates; then in 2022, all three plasmids co-integrated while maintaining critical fitness genes but losing extraneous genomic material. This parallels genome efficiency and reduction that we see across millenia or even millions of years with obligate parasites with increased niche-specificity.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDental calculus is increasingly used by researchers to study dietary patterns in past populations. The benefits of using dental calculus for this purpose have been clearly demonstrated in previous studies, with dental calculus harbouring a wealth of microremains and biomarkers for health and diet within its mineral matrix. Previous studies have demonstrated some of the limitations and biases of how methods of processing may overlook, or even remove, some of the important information contained within the mineralised matrix. However, there are many factors that are impossible to account for in vivo and in archaeological material, such as exact dietary intake, and individual factors such as pH and enzyme activity, leaving some limitations that may not be addressed through these types of studies and will require a different approach.\n\nWe present a protocol for creating a calcifying oral biofilm model that can be used to explore the biases and limitations of dental calculus as a medium for paleodietary reconstructions. We report the microbial and mineral composition of our model in an effort to validate the model calculus as an appropriate proxy to natural dental calculus. The microbial profile and species diversity of our model was determined using metagenomic classification with the nf-core/eager pipeline and Kraken2, and compared to various reference samples from oral sites, including saliva, plaque, and dental calculus. We then assessed whether our model calculus mineralises in a manner similar to natural dental calculus using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The metagenomic classification showed a microbial profile predominantly made up of (facultative) anaerobes, with a community structure that was somewhat distinct from other oral reference samples. The core genera of the model consisted of oral species, but clustered separately from oral reference samples, with a higher abundance of anaerobes.\n\nMineral and organic components of our model mimic that of the modern and archaeological reference calculus that was used as a comparison. There was an overall increase in the inorganic component relative to organic over the course of the experiment, with carbonated hydroxyapatite as the principal compound, consistent with natural human-derived calculus.\n\nWe conclude that oral biofilm models, such as the one presented in this study, have great potential to validate current methods used in the analysis of archaeological dental calculus, and should be used to complement, rather than replace current in vivo studies.",

    "abstract": "In Bacillus subtilis, the RicT (YaaT), RicA (YmcA) and RicF (YlbF) proteins, which form a stable ternary complex, are needed together with RNase Y (Rny), to cleave and thereby stabilize several key transcripts encoding enzymes of intermediary metabolism. We show here that RicT, but not RicA or RicF, forms a stable complex with Rny, and that this association requires the presence of RicA and RicF. We propose that RicT is handed off from the ternary complex to Rny. We show further that the two iron-sulfur clusters carried by the ternary Ric complex are required for the formation of the stable RicT-Rny complex. We demonstrate that proteins of the degradosome-like network of B. subtilis, which also interact with Rny, are dispensable for processing of the gapA operon. Thus, Rny participates in distinct RNA-related processes, determined by its binding partners, and a RicT-Rny complex is likely the functional entity for gapA mRNA maturation.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe action of nucleases on RNA is universal and essential for all forms of life and includes processing steps that lead to the mature and functional forms of certain transcripts. In B. subtilis it has been shown that key transcripts for energy producing steps of glycolysis, for nitrogen assimilation and for oxidative phosphorylation, all of them crucial processes of intermediary metabolism, are cleaved at specific locations, resulting in mRNA stabilization. The proteins required for these cleavages in B. subtilis (Rny (RNase Y), RicA (YmcA), RicF (YlbF) and RicT (YaaT)) are broadly conserved among the firmicutes, including in several important pathogens, hinting that regulatory mechanisms they control may also be conserved. Several aspects of these regulatory events have been explored: phenotypes associated with the absence of these proteins have been described, the impact of these absences on the transcriptome has been documented, and there has been significant exploration of the biochemistry and structural biology of Rny and the Ric proteins. The present study further advances our understanding of the association of Ric proteins and Rny and shows that a complex of Rny with RicT is probably the entity that carries out mRNA maturation.",

    "abstract": "Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis. In immunocompetent hosts, symptoms usually resolve within three days; however, in immunocompromised persons, HuNoV infection can become persistent, debilitating, and sometimes life-threatening. There are no licensed therapeutics for HuNoV due to a near half-century delay in its cultivation. Treatment for chronic HuNoV infection in immunosuppressed patients anecdotally includes nitazoxanide, a broad-spectrum antimicrobial licensed for treatment of parasite-induced gastroenteritis. Despite its off-label use for chronic HuNoV infection, nitazoxanide has not been clearly demonstrated to be an effective treatment. In this study, we established a standardized pipeline for antiviral testing using multiple human small intestinal enteroid (HIE) lines representing different intestinal segments and evaluated whether nitazoxanide inhibits replication of 5 HuNoV strains in vitro. Nitazoxanide did not exhibit high selective antiviral activity against any HuNoV strains tested, indicating it is not an effective antiviral for norovirus infection. HIEs are further demonstrated as a model to serve as a pre-clinical platform to test antivirals against human noroviruses to treat gastrointestinal disease.",

    "abstract": "Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) are important pathogens that can develop resistance via multiple molecular mechanisms, including enzymatic hydrolysis or reduced antibiotic influx. The identification of these mechanisms is crucial for effective pathogen surveillance, infection control, and patient care. However, many clinical laboratories do not test for the molecular basis of resistance. In this study, we investigated whether we could gain insight into resistance mechanisms by using the inoculum effect (IE), a phenomenon where the inoculum size used in antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) affects the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measured. We demonstrated that seven different carbapenemases impart a meropenem IE when expressed in Escherichia coli. Next, we measured the meropenem MIC as a function of inoculum size for 110 clinical CRE isolates. We found that the carbapenem IE was strictly dependent on the resistance mechanism: carbapenemase-producing CRE (CP-CRE) exhibited a strong IE, whereas porin-deficient CRE (PD-CRE) displayed none. Strains with both carbapenemases and porin deficiency had higher MICs at low inoculum and also an IE; we termed these \"hyper-CRE\". Concerningly, 50% and 24% of CP-CRE isolates changed susceptibility classification to meropenem and ertapenem, respectively, across the allowable inoculum range in clinical guidelines, with 42% testing meropenem susceptible at some point in this range. The meropenem IE and the ratio of ertapenem to meropenem MIC at standard inoculum reliably distinguished CP-CRE and hyper-CRE from PD-CRE. Understanding how molecular mechanisms of resistance affect AST could improve diagnosis and guide therapies for CRE infections.\n\nSignificance StatementInfections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) pose a significant threat to public health worldwide. Carbapenem resistance can occur through several molecular mechanisms, including enzymatic hydrolysis by carbapenemases and reduced influx via porin mutations. Knowing the mechanisms of resistance informs therapies and infection control measures to prevent further spread of these deadly pathogens. In a large collection of CRE isolates, we found that only carbapenemase-producing CRE exhibit an inoculum effect, in which their measured resistance varies markedly with cell density, which risks misdiagnosis. Measuring this inoculum effect, or integrating other data from routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing, enhances the detection of carbapenem resistance and thus paves the way for more effective strategies to combat this growing public health crisis.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas putida have emerged as promising biocatalysts for the conversion of sugars and aromatics obtained from lignocellulosic biomass. Understanding the role of carbon catabolite repression (CCR) in these strains is critical to optimize biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals. The CCR functioning in P. putida M2, a strain capable of consuming both hexose and pentose sugars as well as aromatics, was investigated by cultivation experiments, proteomics, and CRISPRi-based gene repression. Strain M2 co-utilized sugars and aromatics simultaneously; however, during co-cultivation with glucose and phenylpropanoid aromatics (p-coumarate and ferulate), intermediates (4-hydroxybenzoate and vanillate) accumulated, and substrate consumption was incomplete. In contrast, xylose-aromatic consumption resulted in transient intermediate accumulation and complete aromatic consumption, while xylose was incompletely consumed. Proteomics analysis revealed that glucose exerted stronger repression than xylose on the aromatic catabolic proteins. Key glucose (Eda) and xylose (XylX) catabolic proteins were also identified at lower abundance during co-cultivation with aromatics implying simultaneous catabolite repression by sugars and aromatics. Downregulation of crc via CRISPRi led to faster growth and uptake of glucose and p-coumarate in the CRISPRi strains compared to the control while no difference was observed on xylose + p-coumarate. The increased abundance of the Eda and amino acids biosynthesis proteins in the CRISPRi strain further supported these observations. Lastly, small RNAs (sRNAs) sequencing results showed that CrcY and CrcZ homologues levels in M2, previously identified in P. putida strains, were lower under strong CCR (glucose + p-coumarate) condition compared to when repression was absent (p-coumarate or glucose only).\n\nIMPORTANCEA newly isolated Pseudomonas putida strain, P. putida M2, can utilize both hexose and pentose sugars as well as aromatics making it a promising host for the valorization of lignocellulosic biomass. Pseudomonads have developed a regulatory strategy, carbon catabolite repression, to control the assimilation of carbon sources in the environment. Carbon catabolite repression may impede the simultaneous and complete metabolism of sugars and aromatics present in lignocellulosic biomass and hinder the development of an efficient industrial biocatalyst. This study provides insight into the cellular physiology and proteome during mixed-substrate utilization in P. putida M2. The phenotypic and proteomics results demonstrated simultaneous catabolite repression in the sugar-aromatic mixtures while the CRISPRi and sRNA sequencing demonstrated the potential role of the crc gene and small RNAs in carbon catabolite repression.",

    "abstract": "Growing brinjal (Solanum melongena L.) in a soil polluted with organophosphorus pesticide (OP) residues coupled with an additional threat of wilt disease caused by Ralstonia solanacearum (Rs), pose a formidable management challenge for residue free crop production. Our study aimed at identifying efficient OP-degrading bacteria (OPDB) and their compatibility with microbial bio-control agents (MBCA) for twin objective of microbial degradation of OP -residues and reduction in incidence of bacterial wilt of brinjal in OP-contaminated soil. As many, ten bacterial isolates showing OP-degrading potential were recovered through colony growth in mineral salt (MS) - medium treated with 25 ppm chlorpyriphos. Efficient isolates displaying growth up to 700ppm chlorpyriphos were further screened for OP-degradation, leading to identification of two most efficient OPDB, Acromobacter marplatensis [MW397524] (Am) and Pseudomonas azotoformans [MW397525] (Pa). These two isolates having in vitro compatibility with each other, showed further compatibility with two most widely used MBCA, viz., Pseudomonas flourescens [KT258013] (Pf) and Trichoderma harzianum [ON364138] (Th), facilitating the development of consortium having extended functional corridor. The response of combination of OPDB + MBCA(Am +Pa + Pf + Th) showed 80% lower percent wilt incidence (PWI), 2.8 times higher fruit yield of brinjal, and 15-25% lower OP-residues over un-inoculated control treatment. Our studies, hence, put forward a strong unified delivery mechanism of OPDB and MBCA as a part of green technology for chemical residue -free vegetable production in contaminated soils.\n\nIMPORTANCEMicrobes isolated from crop rhizospheres are known to exhibit multiple functions (plant growth promotion, antagonism against soil borne pathogens e.g., Rs, and acaricidal properties) depending upon type of stimuli by regulating the plant defense. Considering the limited past efforts on twin objective of cleaning up the pesticide residues accumulated in the soil (microbial removal of pesticide residues) and providing an additional safeguard against soil borne pathogen causing bacterial wilt in brinjal to collectively develop a microbial consortia mediated crop production system, devoid of any chemical residues. Such an effort adds strength to organic production system on pesticide contaminated soils. In the present study, we succeeded in identifying two most effective chloropyrifos residues degrading OPDB having compatibility two MBCA for developing consortia formulation, which aided in developing pesticide residue free soil, neutralising bacterial wilt pathogen (Rs), and creating a better nutrient supply for a well deserved production system. Such efforts would pave the way for developing more robust microbial formulations (with emphasis on entomopathogenic application) having dynamic microbial functions to replace any futuristic use of agrochemcials.",

    "abstract": "Sensory systems allow pathogens to differentiate between different niches and respond to stimuli within them. A major mechanism through which bacteria sense and respond to stimuli in their surroundings is two-component systems (TCSs). TCSs allow for the detection of multiple stimuli to lead to a highly controlled and rapid change in gene expression. Here, we provide a comprehensive list of TCSs important for the pathogenesis of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). UPEC accounts for >75% of urinary tract infections (UTIs) worldwide. UTIs are most prevalent among people assigned female at birth, with the vagina becoming colonized by UPEC in addition to the gut and the bladder. In the bladder, adherence to the urothelium triggers E. coli invasion of bladder cells and an intracellular pathogenic cascade. Intracellular E. coli are safely hidden from host neutrophils, competition from the microbiota, and antibiotics that kill extracellular E. coli. To survive in these intimately connected, yet physiologically diverse niches E. coli must rapidly coordinate metabolic and virulence systems in response to the distinct stimuli encountered in each environment. We hypothesized that specific TCSs allow UPEC to sense these diverse environments encountered during infection with built-in redundant safeguards. Here, we created a library of isogenic TCS deletion mutants that we leveraged to map distinct TCS contributions to infection. We identify - for the first time - a comprehensive panel of UPEC TCSs that are critical for infection of the genitourinary tract and report that the TCSs mediating colonization of the bladder, kidneys, or vagina are distinct.\n\nIMPORTANCEWhile two-component system (TCS) signaling has been investigated at depth in model strains of E. coli, there have been no studies to elucidate - at a systems level - which TCSs are important during infection by pathogenic Escherichia coli. Here, we report the generation of a markerless TCS deletion library in a uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) isolate that can be leveraged for dissecting the role of TCS signaling in different aspects of pathogenesis. We use this library to demonstrate, for the first time in UPEC, that niche-specific colonization is guided by distinct TCS groups.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria play an important role in primary production and nitrogen fixation. Although Cyanobacteria are well-known diazotrophic organisms, their role in other steps Nitrogen Cycle is obscure. Screening of Cyanobacterial genomes from cultured and unculturable species can help identify potentially novel functions. In this study, we assembled Cyanobacterial genomes from metagenomic data generated from environmental DNA isolated from a brackish water lagoon (Chilika, India). We annotated these Cyanobacterial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAG) for all the encoded functions using KEGG Orthology. We found two high-quality Cyanobacterial MAGs containing the nirBD gene and nifH and nifD genes involved in the nitrogen cycle. nirBD encodes for the Dissimilatory Nitrate Reduction to Ammonium (DNRA) activity, a function previously not ascribed to Cyanobacteria. We validated the presence of NirBD in publicly available isolate genomes of Cyanobacteria and examined its evolution in the phylum by phylogenetic reconciliation of species and gene trees. Our analysis revealed that both horizontal gene transfers and speciation events contributed to the dispersal of the nirBD gene in Cyanobacteria. We observed that mostly filamentous Cyanobacteria served as ancestral donors in horizontal gene transfer events. Further, we found that the nirBD gene is under a purifying selection pressure in Cyanobacteria. This study demonstrates the genomic potential and evolution of DNRA activity in Cyanobacteria for the utilisation of nitrate in the ecosystem which can help these organisms to cope with extreme environmental conditions. It expands our overall comprehension of the contribution of Cyanobacteria in the biogeochemical cycling in aquatic ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Bioactive metabolites produced by symbiotic microbiota causally impact host health and disease, nonetheless, incomplete functional annotation of genes as well as complexities and dynamic nature of microbiota make understanding species-level contribution in production and actions difficult. Alpha-galactosylceramides produced by Bacteroides fragilis (BfaGC) are one of the first modulators of colonic immune development, but biosynthetic pathways and the significance of the single species in the symbiont community still remained elusive.\n\nTo address these questions at the microbiota level, we have investigated the lipidomic profiles of prominent gut symbionts and the metagenome-level landscape of responsible gene signatures in the human gut. We first elucidated the chemical diversity of sphingolipid biosynthesis pathways of major bacterial species. In addition to commonly shared ceramide backbone synthases showing two distinct intermediates, alpha-galactosyltransferase (agcT), the necessary and sufficient component for BfaGC production and host colonic type I natural killer T (NKT) cell regulation by B. fragilis, was characterized by forward-genetics based targeted metabolomic screenings. Phylogenetic analysis of agcT in human gut symbionts revealed that only a few ceramide producers have agcT and hence can produce aGCs, on the other hand, structurally conserved homologues of agcT are widely distributed among species lacking ceramides. Among them, alpha-glucosyl-diacylglycerol(aGlcDAG)-producing glycosyltransferases with conserved GT4-GT1 domains are one of the most prominent homologs in gut microbiota, represented by Enterococcus bgsB. Of interest, aGlcDAGs produced by bgsB can antagonize BfaGC-mediated activation of NKT cells, showing the opposite, lipid structure-specific actions to regulate host immune responses. Further metagenomic analysis of multiple human cohorts uncovered that the agcT gene signature is almost exclusively contributed by B. fragilis, regardless of age, geographical and health status, where the bgsB signature is contributed by >100 species, of which abundance of individual microbes is highly variable. Our results collectively showcase the diversities of gut microbiota producing biologically relevant metabolites in multiple layers-biosynthetic pathways, host immunomodulatory functions and microbiome-level landscapes in the host.",

    "abstract": "Although the human bladder is reported to harbor unique microbiota, our understanding of how these microbial communities interact with their human hosts is limited, mostly owing to the lack of isolates to test mechanistic hypotheses. Niche-specific bacterial collections and associated reference genome databases have been instrumental in expanding knowledge of the microbiota of other anatomical sites, e.g., the gut and oral cavity. To facilitate genomic, functional, and experimental analyses of the human bladder microbiota, here we present a bladder-specific bacterial reference collection comprised of 1134 genomes. These genomes were culled from bacterial isolates obtained by a metaculturomic method from bladder urine collected by transurethral catheterization. This bladder-specific bacterial reference collection includes 196 different species, including representatives of major aerobes and facultative anaerobes, as well as some anaerobes. It captures 72.2 % of the genera found when we reexamined previously published 16S rRNA gene sequencing of 392 adult female bladder urine samples. Comparative genomic analysis found that the taxonomies and functions of the bladder microbiota shared more similarities with the vaginal microbiota than the gut microbiota. Whole-genome phylogenetic and functional analyses of 186 bladder E. coli isolates and 387 gut E. coli isolates supports the hypothesis that phylogroup distribution and functions of E. coli strains differ dramatically between these two very different niches. This bladder-specific bacterial reference collection is a unique resource that will enable hypothesis-driven bladder microbiota research and comparison to isolates from other anatomical sites.",

Thirty-five co-abundance groups (CAGs), clustered from 297 prevalent amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), showed greater concordance with beta-diversity plots based on all 1131 ASVs than the 130 classifiable genera, leading to a significantly improved preservation of community-level information. TRF-enriched CAGs positively correlated with metabolic improvement, while TRF-reduced CAGs negatively correlated. TRF restored the diurnal rhythm of most of these key CAGs. Novel ASVs, unclassifiable at the genus level, were identified in these key CAGs.

It is generally assumed that most cells contain self-sustained circadian clocks that drive circadian rhythms in gene expression that ultimately generating circadian rhythms in physiology. While those clocks supposedly act cell autonomously, current work suggests that in Drosophila some of them can be adjusted by the brain circadian pacemaker through neuropeptides, like the Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF). Despite these findings and the ample knowledge of the molecular clockwork, it is still unknown how circadian gene expression in Drosophila is achieved across the body.\n\nResultsHere, we used single-cell and bulk RNAseq data to identify cells within the fly that express core-clock components. Surprisingly, we found that less than a third of the cell types in the fly express core-clock genes. Moreover, we identified Lamina wild field (Lawf) and Ponx-neuro positive (Poxn) neurons as putative new circadian neurons. In addition, we found several cell types that do not express core clock components but are highly enriched for cyclically expressed mRNAs. Strikingly, these cell types express the PDF receptor (Pdfr), suggesting that PDF drives rhythmic gene expression in many cell types in flies. Other cell types express both core circadian clock components and Pdfr, suggesting that in these cells, PDF regulates the phase of rhythmic gene expression.\n\nConclusionsTogether, our data suggest three different mechanisms generate cyclic daily gene expression in cells and tissues: canonical endogenous canonical molecular clock, PDF signaling-driven expression, or a combination of both.",

However, it is unknown how proteasome activity is linked to cell survival/death under hyperosmotic stress. We have previously reported that apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 3 (ASK3) contributes to cell survival through its inactivation under hyperosmotic stress. 19S regulatory particle subunits of the proteasome were enriched in the ASK3 inactivator candidates identified through our genome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen. In this study, we demonstrate that the proteasome regulates ASK3 inactivation through its proteolytic activity. Intriguingly, the proteasome inactivates ASK3 via degradation of not ASK3 per se but another ASK family member ASK1 which activates ASK3 in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Furthermore, the elevated ASK1 level under proteasome inhibition sensitizes cells to hyperosmotic stress. These findings suggest that ASK family maintenance links proteasome capacity to cell fate bifurcation under hyperosmotic stress.",

    "abstract": "Collembola are used widely to monitor soil health and functional parameters. Recent developments in high throughput sequencing (especially metabarcoding) have substantially increased their potential for these ends. Collembola are especially amenable to metabarcoding because of their small size, high abundance, and ubiquity in most habitat types. However, most Collembola sampling protocols collect a substantial and highly varied bycatch that can be a considerable impediment to metabarcoding, especially because of data lost to non-target species. We designed a primer set amplifying the D2 expansion segment of ribosomal DNA that is highly conserved across Collembola and successfully excludes from amplification nearly all other invertebrate taxa. We tested the diagnostic power of the primer set by clearly distinguishing Collembola communities between forest sites with differing habitat qualities in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The oligos successfully amplified targets from all Collembola orders previously encountered in the sampling locations, with no non-target amplification, and also excluded the closely related Protura and Diplura. Alpha diversity (OTU count) and phylogenetic diversity was significantly higher in high quality habitats. Moreover, the beta diversity indices successfully differentiated high and low-quality habitats. This new addition to the biomonitoring toolbox greatly increases the accessibility of Collembola metabarcoding for various types of habitat assessments.",

    "abstract": "To adapt to the change of intertidal environment, intertidal macroalgae have evolved complicated Ci utilization mechanism. However, our knowledge regarding the CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM) of macroalgae is limited. Carbonic anhydrase (CA), a key component of CCM, plays important roles in many physiological reactions in various organisms. While there are a large number of genes encoding CA in the Pyropia yezoensis genome, the exact function of specific CA in P. yezoensis remains elusive. To explore the specific function of chloroplast CA in intertidal macroalgae, we produced chloroplast-localized {beta}CA1 knockdown mutants of P. yezoensis through RNA interference, and Pyca1i mutants showed a notable decrease in leaf area and overall biomass, as well as decreased soluble protein and unsaturated fatty acid content under different DIC conditions. However, Pyca1i mutants showed relatively higher starch content compared to the wild-type. The activity of enzymes involved in Calvin cycle, photorespiration, Pentose-phosphate pathway and floridean starch synthesis of P.yezoensis indicated an effective starch accumulation pathway after interference of {beta}CA1. All results suggest that the decreased activity of Py{beta}CA1 impaired the CCM and development of thalli of P.yezoensis, but stimulated starch accumulation in the cytoplasm through feedback to the photorespiration pathway and PP pathway to replenish intermediates for the Calvin cycle. This study is the first to explore the specific function of chloroplast CA in intertidal macroalgae using genomic technology. The results provide valuable insights into the adaption mechanisms of intertidal macroalgae to their environment.",

    "abstract": "The insulin signaling pathway is evolutionarily conserved throughout metazoans, playing key roles in development, growth, and metabolism. Misregulation of this pathway is associated with a multitude of disease states including diabetes, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Genome-wide association studies indicate that natural variants in putative intronic regulatory elements of the human insulin receptor gene (INSR) are associated with metabolic conditions, however, this genes transcriptional regulation remains incompletely studied. INSR is widely expressed throughout development and was previously described as a  housekeeping gene. Yet, there is abundant evidence that this gene is expressed in a cell-type specific manner, with dynamic regulation in response to environmental signals. The Drosophila insulin-like receptor gene (InR) is homologous to the human INSR gene and was previously shown to be regulated by multiple transcriptional elements located primarily within the introns of the gene. These elements were roughly defined in [~]1.5 kbp segments, but we lack an understanding of the potential detailed mechanisms of their regulation, as well as the integrative output of the battery of enhancers in the entire locus. Using luciferase assays, we characterized the substructure of these cis-regulatory elements in Drosophila S2 cells, focusing on regulation through the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and the dFOXO transcription factor. The direct action of EcR on Enhancer 2 reveals a bimodal form of regulation, with active repression in the absence of the ligand, and positive activation in the presence of 20E. By identifying the location of activators of this enhancer, we characterized a long-range of repression acting over at least 475 bp, similar to the action of long-range repressors found in the embryo. dFOXO and 20E have contrasting effects on some of the individual regulatory elements, and for the adjacent enhancers 2 and 3, their influence was/was not found to be additive, indicating that enhancer action on this locus can/cannot be characterized in part by additive models. Other characterized enhancers from within this locus exhibited \"distributed\" or \"localized\" modes of action, suggesting that predicting the joint functional output of multiple regulatory regions will require a deeper experimental characterization. The noncoding intronic regions of InR have demonstrated dynamic regulation of expression and cell type specificity. This complex transcriptional circuitry goes beyond the simple conception of a  housekeeping gene. Further studies are aimed at identifying how these elements work together in vivo to generate finely tuned expression in tissue- and temporal-specific manners, to provide a guide to understanding the impact of natural variation in this genes regulation, applicable to human genetic studies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBackground: Cardiac fibrosis is a common pathological process in heart disease and represents a therapeutic target. TGF{beta} is the canonical driver of cardiac fibrosis and was recently shown to be dependent on IL11 for its profibrotic effects in fibroblasts. In the opposite direction, recombinant human IL11 has been reported as anti-fibrotic and also anti- inflammatory in the mouse heart. Objectives: In this study, we determined the effects of IL11 expression in cardiomyocytes on cardiac pathobiology and function. Methods: We used the Cre-loxP system to generate a tamoxifen-inducible mouse with cardiomyocyte-restricted murine Il11 expression. Using protein assays, bulk RNA-sequencing, and in vivo imaging we analysed the effects of IL11 on myocardial fibrosis, inflammation and cardiac function and challenge previous reports suggesting cardioprotective potential of IL11. Results: TGF{beta} stimulation of cardiomyocytes caused Il11 upregulation. As compared to wild-type controls, Il11 expressing hearts demonstrated severe cardiac fibrosis and inflammation that was associated with the upregulation of cytokines, chemokines, complement factors and increased inflammatory cells. IL11 expression also activated a programme of endothelial-to- mesenchymal transition and resulted in left ventricular dysfunction. Conclusion: Our data define species matched IL11 as strongly profibrotic and proinflammatory when secreted from cardiomyocytes and further establish IL11 as a disease factor.",

To begin to understand the evolution of this pathway and the significance of the relationships among its components, we characterized 11 C. briggsae orthologs of C. elegans heterochronic genes. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we made a variety of alleles and found that several mutant phenotypes differ in significant ways from those of C. elegans. Although most mutant orthologs displayed defects in developmental timing, their phenotypes could differ in which stages were affected, the penetrance and expressivity of the phenotypes, or by having additional pleiotropies that were not obviously connected to developmental timing. However, when examining pairwise epistasis and synergistic relationships, we found those paralleled the known relationships between their C. elegans orthologs, suggesting that the arrangements of these genes in functional modules is conserved, but the modules relationships to each other and/or to their targets has drifted since the time of the species last common ancestor. Furthermore, our investigation has revealed a relationship to this pathway to other aspects of the animals growth and development, including gonad development, that is relevant to both species.",

Periosteal cells (PCs) of jaw bones are different from those of long bones in phenotypic characteristics and functions. So far, the role of periosteum in jaw bones during bone grafting remain unclarified. Here we propose a subperiosteal bone grafting model based on the clinical procedures. By integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomic (ST), we found a functional Ctsk+Fmod+ subset of PCs in jaw bones. The Ctsk+Fmod+ PCs had the potential of multi-directional differentiation. Furthermore, Spp1 secreted by macrophages could impair the osteogenic capacity of Ctsk+Fmod+ PCs, which could be partly rescued by blocking Spp1. The identification of this Ctsk+Fmod+ subclusters, which shows osteoprogenitor characteristics and close interaction with macrophages, reveals the heterogeneity of periosteal cells in jaw bones, and may provide target of intervention to improve osteogenesis during bone augmentation surgery.",

We generated a custom AAV8- packaged mCherry-eGFP-LC3B biosensor driven by the insulin promoter for beta-cell-selective expression. For real time autophagic flux evaluation, fluorescent signal from eGFP and mCherry fluorophores was correlated in space and time to follow the process of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. We observed autophagic flux defects in the beta-cells of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of T1D prior to hyperglycemia onset that were less apparent in mice without a functional immune system. We also evaluated autophagic flux in human donor islets that were transplanted under the kidney capsule of immune incompetent mice. Collectively, we provide the first evaluation of autophagic flux in vivo in 4D and demonstrate that autophagy defects precede hyperglycemia in NOD mice suggesting a potential causative role for these defects in beta-cell demise during T1D pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The gut plays a critical role in maintaining human health by facilitating the absorption of nutrients, regulating metabolism, and interacting with the immune system and gut microbiota. The co-culture of two human colorectal cancer cell lines, Caco-2 and HT29, on Transwell is commonly used as an in vitro gut mimic in studies of intestinal absorption pharmacokinetics, gut mechanics, and gut-microbe interplay given the similar morphology, expression of transporters and enzymes, and barrier function. However, to sufficiently evaluate the translatability of insights from such a system to human physiological contexts, a detailed survey of cell type heterogeneity in the system and a holistic comparison with human physiology are needed to be conducted rather than by the presence of a few well-studied proteins. Single-cell RNA sequencing provides high-resolution expression profiles of cells in the co-culture, enabling the heterogeneity to be characterized and the similarity to human epithelial cells to be evaluated. Transcriptional profiles of 16019 genes in 13784 cells were acquired and compared to human epithelial cells (GSE185224). We identified the intestinal stem cell-, transit amplifying-, enterocyte-, goblet cell-, and enteroendocrine-like cells together with differentiating HT29 cells in the system based on the expression of canonical markers in healthy adult human epithelial cells. The epithelium-like co-culture was fetal intestine-like, with less variety of gene expression compared to the human gut. Transporters for major types of substance (lipid, amino acid, ion, water, etc.) were found transcribed in the majority of the enterocytes-like cells in the system. However, some of the well-studied transporters such as FATP4 and GLUT2 were absent. Toll-like receptors were not highly expressed in the sample, yet the treatment of lipopolysaccharide still caused a mild change in trans-epithelial electrical resistance and gene expression, possibly by the interaction with CD14, the co-receptor for TLRs. Overall, the Caco-2/HT29 co-culture is a cost-effective epithelium model for drug permeability testing or mechanical simulation, but its phenotypic discrepancy with the real epithelium is not negligible. As a result, its response to biological factors might not provide transferrable knowledge to the study of human gut physiology, especially the innate immune aspect.",

How epithelial cells regulate the hydraulic and cortical forces to control lumen morphology is not completely understood. Here, we quantified the mechanical role of tight junctions in lumen formation using genetically modified MDCKII cysts. We found that the paracellular ion barrier formed by claudin receptors is not required for hydraulic inflation of lumen. However, depletion of the zonula occludens scaffold resulted in lumen collapse and folding of apical membranes. Combining quantitative measurements and perturbations of hydrostatic lumen pressure and junctional tension with modelling, we were able to predict lumen morphologies from the pressure-tension force balance. We found that in MDCK tissue the tight junction promotes formation of spherical lumen by decreasing cortical tension via inhibition of myosin. In addition, we found that the apical surface area of cells is largely uncoupled from lumen volume changes, suggesting that excess apical area contributes to lumen opening in the low-pressure regime. Overall, our findings provide a mechanical understanding of how epithelial cells use tight junctions to modulate tissue and lumen shape.",

    "abstract": "Over the past several decades, a trend toward delayed childbirth has led to increases in parental age at the time of conception. Sperm epigenome undergoes age-dependent changes increasing risks of adverse conditions in offspring conceived by fathers of advanced age. Animal experiments also demonstrate that epigenetic transfer of maladaptive information of advanced age fathers is associated with reduced offspring health including reduced life span. The mechanism(s) linking paternal age with epigenetic changes in sperm remain unknown. The sperm epigenome is shaped in a compartment protected by the blood-testes barrier (BTB) known to deteriorate with age. Permeability of the BTB is regulated by the balance of two mTOR complexes in Sertoli cells. We hypothesized that this balance is also responsible for age-dependent changes in the sperm epigenome. Experiments with transgenic mice demonstrate that the shift of the balance in favor of mTOR complex two rejuvenates sperm DNA-methylome while the shift in favor of mTOR complex one accelerates aging of the sperm DNA-methylome and results in a reproductive phenotype concordant with older age. These results demonstrate for the first time that the balance of mTOR complexes in Sertoli cells regulates the rate of sperm epigenetic aging. Thus, mTOR pathway in Sertoli cells may be used as novel target of therapeutic interventions to rejuvenate the sperm epigenome in advanced-age fathers.",

Canonical Wnt signaling and its inhibitors are implicated in the early steps of ectodermal appendage development and patterning. To study the activation dynamics of the Wnt target and inhibitor Dickkopf4 (Dkk4) in ectodermal appendages, we used CRSIPR/Cas9 to generate a Dkk4-Cre knock-in mouse (Mus musculus) line, where the Cre recombinase cDNA replaces the expression of endogenous Dkk4. Using Cre reporters, the Dkk4-Cre activity was evident at the prospective sites of ectodermal appendages, overlapping with the Dkk4 mRNA expression. Unexpectedly, a predominantly mesenchymal cell population in the embryo posterior also showed Dkk4-Cre activity. Lineage-tracing suggested that these cells are likely derived from a few Dkk4-Cre-expressing cells in the epiblast at early gastrulation. Finally, our analyses of Dkk4-Cre-expressing cells in developing hair follicle epithelial placodes revealed intra- and inter-placodal cellular heterogeneity, supporting emerging data on the positional and transcriptional variability in placodes.

We present evidence that polar lobe inheritance is not sufficient to specify 3D potential, but rather makes the D macromere lineage responsive to some intercellular signal(s) required for activating the special properties of 3D. Experimental removal of micromeres results in loss of organizer-linked MAPK activation, complete and specific defects of organizer-dependent larval organs, and progressive cell cycle retardation leading to equalization of the normally accelerated division schedule of 3D. Ablation of the second-quartet micromere 2d greatly potentiates the effects of first-quartet micromere ablation. Our findings link 3D establishment in I. obsoleta to the putative ancestral spiralian mechanism in which a signal from micromeres leads to specification of 3D among four initially equivalent macromeres.\n\nSummary StatementCell ablation experiments on embryos of the snail Ilyanassa reveal that specification of the organizer cell 3D depends on cell-extrinsic cues as well as polar lobe inheritance.",

Moreover, RasGAP and ZO-2 are required for transcriptional modulation by p190A.
