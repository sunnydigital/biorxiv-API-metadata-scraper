    "abstract": "A new generation of scalable single cell whole genome sequencing (scWGS) methods allows unprecedented high resolution measurement of the evolutionary dynamics of cancer cell populations. Phylogenetic reconstruction is central to identifying sub-populations and distinguishing the mutational processes that gave rise to them. Existing phylogenetic tree building models do not scale to the tens of thousands of high resolution genomes achievable with current scWGS methods. We constructed a phylogenetic model and associated Bayesian inference procedure, sitka, specifically for scWGS data. The method is based on a novel phylogenetic encoding of copy number (CN) data, the sitka transformation, that simplifies the site dependencies induced by rearrangements while still forming a sound foundation to phylogenetic inference. The sitka transformation allows us to design novel scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. Moreover, we introduce a novel point mutation calling method that incorporates the CN data and the underlying phylogenetic tree to overcome the low per-cell coverage of scWGS. We demonstrate our method on three single cell datasets, including a novel PDX series, and analyse the topological properties of the inferred trees.

    "abstract": "Alstrom syndrome (AS) is a rare multi-system disorder for which early-onset childhood obesity is a cardinal feature. Like humans with AS, animal models with Alms1 loss-of-function mutations develop obesity, supporting the notion that ALMS1/Alms1 is required for the regulatory control of energy balance across species. This study aimed to determine which component(s) of energy balance are reliant on Alms1. Here, we performed comprehensive energy balance phenotyping Alms1tvrm102 mice at both eight- and eighteen-weeks-of-age. We found that adiposity gains occurred early and rapidly in Alms1tvrm102 male mice but much later in females. Rapid increases in body fat in males was due to a marked reduction in energy expenditure (EE) during early life and not due to any genotype-specific increases in energy intake under chow conditions. Energy intake did increase in a genotype-specific manner when mice were provided a high-fat-diet, exacerbating the effects of reduced EE on obesity progression. The EE deficit observed in male Alms1tvrm102 mice did not persist as mice aged, suggesting loss of Alms1 either causes a developmental delay in the mechanisms controlling early life EE, or that activation of compensatory mechanisms occurs after obesity is established. Future studies will determine how ALMS1/Alms1 modulates EE and how sex moderates this process.",

    "abstract": "1Bi-stable gene regulatory motifs are found in a wide variety of natural gene regulatory networks and effect transcriptional switching between stable phenotypic states in cells. In synthetic gene regulatory circuits, these architectures can be leveraged to dynamically switch between distinct metabolic states for metabolic engineering and therapeutic applications. However, the lack of modularity and predictability of these motifs in varying environments has limited widespread application, especially since the factors that affect switching characteristics are still unclear. In this work, we use a mathematical model along with a newly developed dynamical modeling and continuity analysis framework to analyze the dynamics and robustness of bi-stable switches over a range of biologically relevant model parameter values. We identify a hitherto undiscovered fundamental trade-off between the robustness of the motif - the parameter ranges over which it retains bi-stable function, and the speed at which it effects a phenotypic change. Further, using E. coli as a model host, we constructed a large library (100) of transcriptional switches that show a wide range of switching speeds, to experimentally demonstrate the presence of this trade-off. The presence of this trade-off has significant implications on the design of transcriptional switches for diverse applications and explains the circuit architecture of naturally occurring transcriptional switches as well. Additionally, we anticipate that our diverse library of experimentally validated robust bi-stable switches will be valuable to effect phenotypic changes with differing switching speed requirements for metabolic engineering applications.\n\n2 Significance statementThe ability to switch genes on and off in response to spatio-temporal stimuli is critical to the survival of all organisms. At the cellular level, such switching is effected by regulatory motifs such as the bi-stable genetic toggle switch. Bi-stable motifs also serve as a primitive mode of cellular memory - \"remembering\" the last environment to which the cells have been exposed. In this work, we uncover a fundamental trade-off between the robust functioning of these switches and the speed at which they can effect a change in the gene expression landscape. These findings have a broad impact on the design and use of such synthetic gene regulatory devices across several fields such as industrial biotechnology, healthcare, etc.",

    "abstract": "Influenza, a negative sense single-strand RNA virus of the genus Orthomyxoviridae, causes respiratory illness in humans and animals and significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. While exposure to a specific influenza A strain causes homologous protection, two immune-dominant influenza A virus (IAV)-encoded epitopes - Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) - undergo antigenic shift and drift, resulting in IAVs to which humans lack pre-existing immunity. Without a universal vaccine or therapeutic agent, influenza virus infections will significantly threaten human health. The extracellular domain of the Matrix protein 2-ion channel (M2e) is an ideal antigenic target for a universal influenza therapy: it is highly conserved across influenza A serotypes, has a low mutation rate, and is essential for viral entry and replication. However, less than 20% of humans generate M2e-specific antibodies in response to IAV exposure, thus lacking the benefits of M2e-MAb-mediated immunity. To therapeutically address this deficit, we generated several non-neutralizing M2e-specific monoclonal antibodies (M2e-MAbs) with strong universal IAV treatment potential. Using three MAbs that bind to M2e differentially and competitively, we developed a low-dose M2e-MAb triple cocktail as an effective universal prophylactic and therapeutic agent. We identified the low-dose M2e-MAb triple cocktails optimal antibody-clone combination, isotype, minimum effective dosage, and administration time points in mouse models challenged with human and zoonotic BSL-2 and BSL-3 IAV strains, demonstrating its universal potential. Using the IgG2a isotype, which had proven most effective, we established Fc{gamma}RI, Fc{gamma}RIII, and Fc{gamma}RIV as required for M2e-MAb-mediated protection of IAV-challenged mice. Importantly, we established individual M2e-MAbs and the resulting triple cocktail as effective and viral escape mutant-resistant treatments in immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice. These unique qualities provide precedence for prioritizing our M2e-MAbs for therapeutic development.\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENTSP serves on the scientific advisory board for Shoreline Biosciences, Qihan Biotechnology and is a Scientific Consultant for Qihan Biotechnology and the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation.

    "abstract": "The dynamics of living cells can be studied by live-cell fluorescence microscopy. However, this requires the use of excessive light energy to obtain good signal-to-noise ratio, which can then photobleach fluorochromes, and more worrisomely, lead to photo-toxicity. Upon light excitation, noble metal nanoparticles such as silver nanoparticles (AgNP) generate plasmons, which can then amplify excitation in direct proximity of the nanoparticles surface and couple to the oscillating dipole of nearby radiating fluorophores, modifying their rate of emission and thus, enhancing their fluorescence. Here, we show that AgNP fed to cells to accumulate within lysosomes enhanced the fluorescence of lysosome-targeted Alexa488-conjugated dextran, BODIPY-cholesterol, and DQ-BSA. Moreover, AgNP increased the fluorescence of GFP fused to the cytosolic tail of LAMP1, showing that metal enhanced fluorescence can occur across the lysosomal membrane. The inclusion of AgNPs in lysosomes did not disturb lysosomal properties such as lysosomal pH, degradative capacity, autophagy and autophagic flux, and membrane integrity, though AgNP seemed to increase basal lysosome tubulation. Importantly, by using AgNP, we could track lysosome motility with reduced laser power without damaging and altering lysosome dynamics. Overall, AgNP-enhanced fluorescence may be a useful tool to study the dynamics of the endo-lysosomal pathway while minimizing photo-toxicity.\n\neTOCSilver nanoparticles enhance fluorescence via surface plasmons. Here, we show that loading lysosomes with silver nanoparticles enhances the fluorescence of fluorochrome- and GFP-based molecular probes for lysosomes. This affords reduced excitation and exposure, diminishing photobleaching and phototoxicity, and preserving lysosome dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Globular bushy cells (GBCs) of the cochlear nucleus play central roles in the temporal processing of sound. Despite investigation over many decades, fundamental questions remain about their dendrite structure, afferent innervation, and integration of synaptic inputs. Here, we use volume electron microscopy (EM) to construct synaptic maps that precisely specify convergence ratios and synaptic weights for auditory- nerve innervation and accurate surface areas of all postsynaptic compartments. Detailed biophysically-based compartmental models can help develop hypotheses regarding how GBCs integrate inputs to yield their recorded responses to sound. We established a pipeline to export a precise reconstruction of auditory nerve axons and their endbulb terminals together with high-resolution dendrite, soma, and axon reconstructions into biophysically-detailed compartmental models that could be activated by a standard cochlear transduction model. With these constraints, the models predict auditory nerve input profiles whereby all endbulbs onto a GBC are subthreshold (coincidence detection mode), or one or two inputs are suprathreshold (mixed mode). The models also predict the relative importance of dendrite geometry, soma size, and axon initial segment length in setting action potential threshold and generating heterogeneity in sound-evoked responses, and thereby propose mechanisms by which GBCs may homeostatically adjust their excitability. Volume EM also reveals new dendritic structures and dendrites that lack innervation. This framework defines a pathway from subcellular morphology to synaptic connectivity, and facilitates investigation into the roles of specific cellular features in sound encoding. We also clarify the need for new experimental measurements to provide missing cellular parameters, and predict responses to sound for further in vivo studies, thereby serving as a template for investigation of other neuron classes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCulture-independent 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding is a commonly used method in microbiome profiling. However, this approach can only reflect the proportion of sequencing reads, rather than the actual cell fraction. To achieve more quantitative cell fraction estimates, we need to resolve the 16S gene copy numbers (GCN) for different community members. Currently, there are several bioinformatic tools available to estimate 16S GCN, either based on taxonomy assignment or phylogeny.\n\nMethodHere we develop a novel algorithm, Stacked Ensemble Model (SEM), that estimates 16S GCN directly from the 16S rRNA gene sequence strings, without resolving taxonomy or phylogeny. For accessibility, we developed a public, end-to-end, web-based tool based on the SEM model, named Artificial Neural Network Approximator for 16S rRNA Gene Copy Number (ANNA16).\n\nResultsBased on 27,579 16S rRNA gene sequence data (rrnDB database), we show that ANNA16 outperforms the most commonly used 16S GCN prediction algorithms. The prediction error range in the 5-fold cross validation of SEM is completely lower than all other algorithms for the 16S full-length sequence and partially lower at 16S subregions. The final test and a mock community test indicate ANNA16 is more accurate than all currently available tools (i.e., rrnDB, CopyRighter, PICRUSt2, & PAPRICA). SHAP value analysis indicates ANNA16 mainly learns information from rare insertions.\n\nConclusionANNA16 represents a deep learning based 16S GCN prediction tool. Compared to the traditional GCN prediction tools, ANNA16 has a simple structure, faster inference speed without precomputing, and higher accuracy. With increased 16S GCN data in the database, future studies could improve the prediction errors for rare, high-GCN taxa due to current under sampling.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory experimental evolution provides a powerful tool for studying microbial adaptation to different environments. To understand the differences and similarities of the dynamic evolutionary landscapes of two model species from the Bacillus genus as they adapt to abiotic and biotic surfaces, we revived the archived population samples from our four previous experimental evolution studies and performed longitudinal whole-population genome sequencing. Surprisingly, higher number of mutations, higher genotypic diversity, and higher evolvability were detected in the biotic conditions with smaller population size. Different adaptation strategies were observed in different environments within each species, with more diversified mutational spectrum detected in biotic conditions. The insertion sequences of Bacillus thuringiensis are critical for its adaptation to the plastic bead-attached biofilm environment, but insertion sequence mobility was a general phenomenon in this species independent of the selection condition. Additionally, certain parallel evolution has been observed across species and environments, particularly when two species adapt to the same environment at the same time. Further, our results suggest that the population size might be an important driver of evolution. Together, these results provide the first comprehensive mutational landscape of two bacterial species biofilms that is adapted to an abiotic and biotic surface.\n\nImportanceBiofilm formation is a vital factor for the survival and adaptation of bacteria in diverse environmental niches. Experimental evolution combined with the advancement of whole-population genome sequencing provides us a powerful tool to understand the genomic dynamic of evolutionary adaptation to different environments, such as during biofilm development. Previous studies described the genetic and phenotypic changes of selected clones from experimentally evolved Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus subtilis that were adapted under abiotic and biotic biofilm conditions. However, the full understanding of the dynamic evolutionary landscapes was lacking. Further, the differences and similarities of adaptive mechanisms in B. thuringiensis and B. subtilis were not identified. To overcome these limitations, we performed longitudinal whole-population genome sequencing to study the underlying genetic dynamics at high resolution. Our study provides the first comprehensive mutational landscape of two bacterial species biofilms that is adapted to an abiotic and biotic surface.",

    "abstract": "Interpreting data using mechanistic mathematical models provides a foundation for discovery and decision-making in all areas of science and engineering. Developing mechanistic insight by combining mathematical models and experimental data is especially critical in mathematical biology as new data and new types of data are collected and reported. Key steps in using mechanistic mathematical models to interpret data include: (i) identifiability analysis; (ii) parameter estimation; and (iii) model prediction. Here we present a systematic, computationally-efficient workflow we call Profile-Wise Analysis (PWA) that addresses all three steps in a unified way. Recently-developed methods for constructing  profile-wise prediction intervals enable this workflow and provide the central linkage between different workflow components. These methods propagate profile-likelihood-based confidence sets for model parameters to predictions in a way that isolates how different parameter combinations affect model predictions. We show how to extend these profile-wise prediction intervals to two-dimensional interest parameters. We then demonstrate how to combine profile-wise prediction confidence sets to give an overall prediction confidence set that approximates the full likelihood-based prediction confidence set well. Our three case studies illustrate practical aspects of the workflow, focusing on ordinary differential equation (ODE) mechanistic models with both Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise models. While the case studies focus on ODE-based models, the workflow applies to other classes of mathematical models, including partial differential equations and simulation-based stochastic models.

    "abstract": "Centrifugation is a commonly performed laboratory procedure that helps to separate blood cells such as red blood cells RBCs, white bood cells WBCs, and platelets from plasma or serum. Although centrifugation is a routine procedure in most medical laboratories, factors that affect the efficacy of the centrifugation process have never been studied analytically. In this paper, we examine the effect of centrifugation time on the efficacy of the centrifugation process by studying the dynamics of blood cells via the well-known Langevin equation or equivalently, by solving the Fokker-Plank equation. Our result depicts that the speed of the centrifuge is one of the determinant factors concerning the efficacy of the centrifugation process. As angular speed increases, centrifugal force increases and as a result, the particles are forced to separate from plasma or serum. The room temperature also considerably affects the dynamics of the sample during centrifugation. Most importantly, the generation of heat during centrifugation increases the temperature within a centrifuge, and as a result, not only the stability of the sample but also the mobility of analyse is affected. We show that as the temperature within the centrifuge intensifies, the velocity of the cells as well as the displacement of the cells in the fluid increases. We then study the dynamics of the whole blood during capillary action where in this case the blood flows upward in a narrow space without the assistance of external forces. Previous investigations show that the height that the fluid rises increases as surface tension steps up. The viscosity of the fluid also affects the capillary action but to date, the dependence of the height on viscosity has never been explored due to the lack of a mathematical correlation between the viscosity of blood and surface tension [1]. In this work, we first examine the correlation between surface tension and viscous friction via data fitting. Our result exhibits that the viscosity of the blood increases linearly as surface tension increases. The mathematical relation between the height and viscous friction is derived. It is shown that the height of the blood that rises in the capillary increases as the viscous friction intensifies. As the temperature of the room steps up, the height also decreases. The dependence of erythrocytes sedimentation rate on surface tension is also studied. The results obtained in this work show that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR increases as surface tension steps down.\n\nPACS numbersValid PACS appear here",

    "abstract": "The immune response to an acute primary infection is a coupled process of antigen proliferation, molecular recognition by naive B-cells, and their subsequent proliferation and antibody shedding. Here we show B-cells can efficiently recognise new antigens by a tuned kinetic proofreading mechanism, where the number of proofreading steps and the characteristic rate of each step are set by the complexity of the immune repertoire. This process produces potent, specific and fast recognition of antigens, maintaining a spectrum of genetically distinct B-cell lineages as input for affinity maturation. We show that the proliferation-recognition dynamics of a primary infection can me mapped onto a generalised Luria-Delbruck process, akin to the dynamics of the classic fluctuation experiment. We derive the resulting statistics of the activated immune repertoire: antigen binding affinity, expected size, and frequency of active B-cell clones are related by power laws. Their exponents depend on the antigen and B-cell proliferation rate, the number of proofreading steps, and the lineage density of the naive repertoire. Empirical data of mouse immune repertoires are found to be consistent with activation involving at least three proofreading steps. Our model predicts key clinical characteristics of acute infections. The primary immune response to a given antigen is strongly heterogeneous across individuals; few elite responders are distinguished by early activation of high-affinity clones. Conversely, ageing of the immune system, by reducing the density of naive clones, degrades potency and speed of pathogen recognition.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a life-altering event causing sensation loss, motor paralysis and impaired autonomic function. Electrical spinal cord stimulation has shown promise for restoring lost motor, and impaired autonomic function, despite targeting lumbar locomotor networks. Sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs), primarily located in the intermediate laminae of thoracic and upper lumbar segments (T1-L2), provide neural input to excite sympathetic tissues and organs that provide homeostatic and metabolic support during movement and exercise. We hypothesized that ascending propriospinal neurons located in the lumbar spinal cord provide synaptic input to thoracic SPNs, providing a spinal neural mechanism explaining improved motor and autonomic function in response to spinal cord stimulation. Here, we demonstrate that synaptic contacts from locomotor-related V3 interneurons (INs) are present in all thoracic laminae. Injection of an anterograde tracer into lumbar segments demonstrated that 8-20% of glutamatergic input onto SPNs originated from lumbar V3 INs and displayed a somatotopographical organization of synaptic input to thoracic SPNs, with rostral lumbar V3 INs projecting to rostral thoracic, and caudal lumbar V3 INs projecting to caudal thoracic SPNs. Whole cell patch clamp recording in SPNs demonstrated prolonged depolarizations or action potentials in response to optical activation of either lumbar V3 INs in spinal cord preparations or in response to optical activation of V3 terminals in thoracic slice preparations. This work demonstrates a direct intraspinal connection between lumbar locomotor and thoracic sympathetic networks and suggests communication between motor and autonomic systems may be a general function of the spinal cord.\n\nKey pointsO_LIWe provide direct anatomical and electrophysiological evidence of an ascending intraspinal synaptic connection between lumbar motor and thoracic sympathetic autonomic neural systems.\nC_LIO_LIThese connections are formed between lumbar locomotor related V3 interneurons and thoracic sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs)\nC_LIO_LIV3 synaptic input accounts for [~] 20% of glutamatergic input to SPNs.\nC_LIO_LIOptical activation of lumbar V3 interneurons elicit action potentials in thoracic SPNs.\nC_LIO_LIThis intraspinal pathway may explain why electrical stimulation of the lumbar region in persons with long-standing motor complete spinal cord injury improves both motor and sympathetic function.\nC_LIO_LIThese findings suggest communication between motor and autonomic systems may be a general feature of spinal cord function and await further research to explore this concept.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Social insects are models for phenotypic plasticity: the generation of different phenotypes from the same genotype. Ant queens and workers differ not only in their morphology and behaviour, but also in their fecundity and lifespan, which is often several times higher in queens. However, the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying these differences are not yet well understood. Since ant queens can live and reproduce for more than two decades, they need to protect their germline from the activity of transposable elements (TEs). This protection may be redundant in short-lived, often sterile workers. We have analysed the expression of two protective classes of smallRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), in different tissues, castes, and age classes of the ant species Temnothorax rugatulus. We show that piRNAs are particularly active in the ovaries of queens. TEs are clear targets of the piRNAs in this ant species, and piRNA-specific sequence signatures in the ovaries of all queens regardless of age indicate that young and old queens have similarly active piRNA pathways. Interestingly, the reduced ovaries of the workers also showed the same level of piRNA activity. This was not only the case in young, fertile workers from queenless nests, but also in the presumably older foragers, which have almost completely regressed ovaries. These findings suggest that the germline in these ants is invariably protected by piRNA activity, irrespective of ovarian development. The brain and thorax of queens also contained piRNAs, but at lower levels, and the piRNA-specific ping-pong signatures were strongly reduced in these tissues. We also annotated and analysed miRNAs in different tissues. We confidently detected the expression of 304 miRNAs. Of these, 10 were enriched in the brain and three to the thorax, whereas 83 were specific to the ovaries. 105 miRNAs were found to be expressed in all three tissues. We also identified miRNAs whose expression potentially is related to ant caste, fecundity, and age, suggesting that caste-specific gene activity may be regulated in part by miRNAs. In contrast, our studies of piRNA activity indicate similar profiles across caste, fecundity and age groups, but strong tissue specificity with the highest piRNA mediated TE protection in the germline.",

We explored the hypothesis that CMPF at a concentration seen in uremia activates Piezo1 located on red blood cells (RBC). We incubated RBC from five healthy individuals with either Jedi1 or CMPF (both 87 M), with or without the Piezo1 inhibitor GsMTx-4 (2 M), and quantified the cells osmotic fragility. Our results indicate that compared to controls (i.e., RBC incubated with buffer), both Jedi1 and CMPF increase the osmotic fragility of RBC (i.e., reduce their resistance to osmotic stress). Effects of Jedi1 and CMPF were reversed to the control level by GsMTx-4. These results indicate a role of Piezo1 in augmenting RBC osmotic fragility and modulation of this effect by Jedi1 and CMPF.

    "abstract": "Decline in protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is a hallmark of cellular aging and aging-related diseases. Maintaining a balanced proteostasis requires a complex network of molecular machineries that govern protein synthesis, folding, localization, and degradation. Under proteotoxic stress, misfolded proteins that accumulate in cytosol can be imported into mitochondria for degradation via  mitochondrial as guardian in cytosol (MAGIC) pathway. Here we report an unexpected role of yeast Gas1, a cell wall-bound glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored {beta}-1,3-glucanosyltransferase, in differentially regulating MAGIC and ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Deletion of Gas1 inhibits MAGIC but elevates polyubiquitination and UPS-mediated protein degradation. Interestingly, we found that Gas1 exhibits mitochondrial localization attributed to its C-terminal GPI anchor signal. But this mitochondria-associated GPI anchor signal is not required for mitochondrial import and degradation of misfolded proteins via MAGIC. By contrast, catalytic inactivation of Gas1 via the gas1E161Qmutation inhibits MAGIC but not its mitochondrial localization. These data suggest that the glucanosyltransferase activity of Gas1 is important for regulating cytosolic proteostasis.",

Syntenin is thought to drive the biogenesis of CD63 exosomes by recruiting Alix and the ESCRT machinery to endosomes, initiating an endosome-mediated pathway of exosome biogenesis. Contrary to this model, we show here that syntenin drives the biogenesis of CD63 exosomes by blocking CD63 endocytosis, thereby allowing CD63 to accumulate at the plasma membrane, the primary site of exosome biogenesis. Consistent with these results, we find that inhibitors of endocytosis induce the exosomal secretion of CD63, that endocytosis inhibits the vesicular secretion of exosome cargo proteins, and that high-level expression of CD63 itself also inhibits endocytosis. These and other results indicate that exosomes bud primarily from the plasma membrane, that endocytosis inhibits their loading into exosomes, that syntenin and CD63 are expression-dependent regulators of exosome biogenesis, and that syntenin drives the biogenesis of CD63 exosomes even in Alix knockout cells.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant alternative splicing can generate neoantigens, which can themselves stimulate immune responses and surveillance. Previous methods for quantifying splicing-derived neoantigens are limited by independent references and potential batch effects. Here, we introduce SpliceMutr, a bioinformatics approach and pipeline for identifying splicing derived neoantigens from paired tumor normal data. SpliceMutr facilitates the identification of tumor-specific antigenic splice variants, predicts MHC-binding affinity, and estimates splicing antigenicity scores per gene. By applying this tool to genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we generate splicing-derived neoantigens and neoantigenicity scores per sample and across all cancer types and find numerous correlations between splicing antigenicity and well-established biomarkers of anti-tumor immunity. Notably, carriers of mutations within splicing machinery genes have higher splicing antigenicity, which provides support for our approach. Further analysis of splicing antigenicity in cohorts of melanoma patients treated with mono- or combined immune checkpoint inhibition suggest that the abundance of splicing antigens is reduced post-treatment from baseline in patients who progress, likely because of an immunoediting process. We also observe increased splicing antigenicity in responders to immunotherapy, which may relate to an increased capacity to mount an immune response to splicing-derived antigens. This new computational tool provides novel analytical capabilities for splicing antigenicity and is openly available for further immuno-oncologic analysis.",

    "abstract": "The question of how interactions between the gut microbiome and vertebrate hosts contribute to host adaptation and speciation is one of the major problems in current evolutionary research. Using bacteriome and mycobiome metabarcoding, we examined how these two components of the gut microbiota vary with the degree of host admixture in secondary contact between two house mouse subspecies (Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus). We used a large dataset collected at two replicates of the hybrid zone and model-based statistical analyses to ensure the robustness of our results. Assuming that the microbiota of wild hosts suffers from spatial autocorrelation, we directly compared the results of statistical models that were spatially naive with those that accounted for spatial autocorrelation. We showed that neglecting spatial autocorrelation can drastically affect the results and lead to misleading conclusions. The spatial analyses showed little difference between subspecies, both in microbiome composition and in individual bacterial lineages. Similarly, the degree of admixture had minimal effects on the gut bacteriome and mycobiome and was caused by changes in a few microbial lineages that correspond to the common symbionts of free-living house mice. In contrast to previous studies, these data do not support the hypothesis that the microbiota plays an important role in host reproductive isolation in this particular model system.",

    "abstract": "Activity patterns tend to be highly stereotyped and critical for executing many different behaviors including foraging, social interactions and predator avoidance. Differences in the circadian timing of locomotor activity and rest periods can facilitate habitat partitioning and the exploitation of novel niches. As a consequence, closely related species often display highly divergent activity patterns, raising the possibility that a shift from diurnal to nocturnal behavior, or vice versa, can occur rapidly. In Africas Lake Malawi alone, there are over 500 species of cichlids, which inhabit diverse environments and exhibit extensive phenotypic variation. We have previously identified a substantial range in activity patterns across adult Lake Malawi cichlid species, from strongly diurnal to strongly nocturnal. In many species, including fishes, ecological pressures differ dramatically across life-history stages, raising the possibility that activity patterns may change over ontogeny. To determine if rest-activity patterns change across life stages we compared the locomotor patterns of six Lake Malawi cichlid species. While total rest and activity did not change between early juvenile and adult stages, rest-activity patterns did, with juveniles displaying distinct activity rhythms that are more robust than adults. One distinct difference between juveniles and adults is the emergence of complex social behavior. To determine whether social context is required for activity rhythms, we next measured locomotor behavior in group housed adult fish. We found that when normal social interactions were allowed, locomotor activity patterns were restored, supporting the notion that social interactions promote circadian regulation of activity in adult fish. These findings reveal a previously unidentified link between developmental stage and social interactions in the circadian timing of cichlid activity.",

The most commonly used software for the lineage assignment of newly isolated SARS-CoV-2 genomes is pangolin, which offers two methods of assignment, pangoLEARN and pUShER. PangoLEARN rapidly assigns lineages using a machine learning algorithm, while pUShER performs a phylogenetic placement to identify the lineage corresponding to a newly sequenced genome. In a preliminary study, we observed that pangoLEARN (decision tree model), while substantially faster than pUShER, offered less consistency across different versions of pangolin v3. Here, we expand upon this analysis to include v3 and v4 of pangolin, which moved the default algorithm for lineage assignment from pangoLEARN in v3 to pUShER in v4, and perform a thorough analysis confirming that pUShER is not only more stable across versions but also more accurate.

    "abstract": "The first step in the process of bacterial natural transformation is DNA capture. Although long-hypothesized based on genetics and functional experiments, the pilus structure responsible for initial DNA-binding had not yet been visualized for Bacillus subtilis. Here, we visualize functional competence pili in Bacillus subtilis using fluorophore-conjugated maleimide labeling in conjunction with epifluorescence microscopy. In strains that produce pilin monomers within ten-fold of wild type levels, the median length of detectable pili is 300nm. These pili are retractile and associate with DNA. Analysis of pilus distribution at the cell surface reveals that they are predominantly located along the long axis of the cell. The distribution is consistent with localization of proteins associated with subsequent transformation steps, DNA-binding and DNA translocation in the cytosol. These data suggest a distributed model for B. subtilis transformation machinery, in which initial steps of DNA capture occur throughout the long axis of the cell and subsequent steps may also occur away from the cell poles.\n\nImportanceThis work provides novel visual evidence for DNA translocation across the cell wall during Bacillus subtilis natural competence, an essential step in the natural transformation process. Our data demonstrate the existence of natural competence associated, retractile pili that can bind exogenous DNA. Furthermore, we show that pilus biogenesis occurs throughout the cell long axis. These data strongly support DNA translocation occurring all along the lateral cell wall during natural competence, wherein pili are produced, bind to free DNA in the extracellular space, and finally retract to pull the bound DNA through the gap in the cell wall created during pilus biogenesis.",

IgM is a large (1 MDa), multimeric protein, for which both hexameric and pentameric structures have been described, the latter additionally containing a joining (J) chain. Using a combination of single-particle mass spectrometry and mass photometry, proteomics and immunochemical assays, we here demonstrate that circulatory (serum) IgM exclusively exists as a complex of J-chain-containing pentamers covalently bound to the small CD5 antigen-like (CD5L, 36 kDa) protein. In sharp contrast, secretory IgM in saliva and milk is principally devoid of CD5L. Unlike IgM itself, CD5L is not produced by B cells, implying that it associates with IgM in the extracellular space. We demonstrate that CD5L integration has functional implications, i.e., it diminishes IgM binding to two of its receptors, the Fc{micro}R and the polymeric Immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR). On the other hand, binding to Fc{micro}R as well as complement activation via C1q seem unaffected by CD5L integration. Taken together, we redefine the composition of circulatory IgM as a J-chain containing pentamer, always in complex with CD5L.",

We studied the effect of a bacterial endosymbiont on a facultatively multicellular social amoeba host. Aggregates of the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum contain a subpopulation of sentinel cells that function akin to the immune systems of more conventional multicellular organisms. Sentinel cells sequester and discard toxins from D. discoideum aggregates and may play a central role in defense against pathogens. We measured the number and functionality of sentinel cells in aggregates of D. discoideum infected by bacterial endosymbionts in the genus Paraburkholderia. Infected D. discoideum produced fewer and less functional sentinel cells, suggesting that Paraburkholderia may interfere with its hosts immune system. Despite impaired sentinel cells, however, infected D. discoideum were less sensitive to ethidium bromide toxicity, suggesting that Paraburkholderia may also have a protective effect on its host. By contrast, D. discoideum infected by Paraburkholderia did not show differences in their sensitivity to two non-symbiotic pathogens.

    "abstract": "Gene editing the BCL11A erythroid enhancer is a validated approach to fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction for {beta}-hemoglobinopathy therapy, though heterogeneity in edit allele distribution and HbF response may impact its safety and efficacy. Here we compared combined CRISPR-Cas9 endonuclease editing of the BCL11A +58 and +55 enhancers with leading gene modification approaches under clinical investigation. We found that combined targeting of the BCL11A +58 and +55 enhancers with 3xNLS-SpCas9 and two sgRNAs resulted in superior HbF induction, including in engrafting erythroid cells from sickle cell disease (SCD) patient xenografts, attributable to simultaneous disruption of core half E-box/GATA motifs at both enhancers. We corroborated prior observations that double strand breaks (DSBs) could produce unintended on- target outcomes in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) such as long deletions and centromere-distal chromosome fragment loss. We show these unintended outcomes are a byproduct of cellular proliferation stimulated by ex vivo culture. Editing HSPCs without cytokine culture bypassed long deletion and micronuclei formation while preserving efficient on-target editing and engraftment function. These results indicate that nuclease editing of quiescent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) limits DSB genotoxicity while maintaining therapeutic potency and encourages efforts for in vivo delivery of nucleases to HSCs.",

    "abstract": "The human mitochondrial ribosome contains three [2Fe-2S] clusters whose assembly pathway, role, and implications for mitochondrial and metabolic diseases are unknown. Here, structure-function correlation studies show that the clusters play a structural role during mitoribosome assembly. To uncover the assembly pathway, we have examined the effect of silencing the expression of Fe-S cluster biosynthetic and delivery factors on mitoribosome stability. We find that the mitoribosome receives its [2Fe-2S] clusters from the GLRX5-BOLA3 node. Additionally, the assembly of the small subunit depends on the mitoribosome biogenesis factor METTL17, recently reported containing a [4Fe-4S] cluster, which we propose is inserted via the ISCA1-NFU1 node. Consistently, fibroblasts from subjects suffering from \"multiple mitochondrial dysfunction\" syndrome due to mutations in BOLA3 or NFU1 display previously unrecognized attenuation of mitochondrial protein synthesis that contributes to their cellular and pathophysiological phenotypes. Finally, we report that, in addition to their structural role, one of the mitoribosomal [2Fe-2S] clusters and the [4Fe-4S] cluster in mitoribosome assembly factor METTL17 sense changes in the redox environment, thus providing a way to regulate organellar protein synthesis accordingly.",

However, how it functions in this process is not well understood. Developing and optimizing a protein purification strategy will facilitate biochemical and structural studies of FAM210A. Here, we developed a method to purify human FAM210A with deleted mitochondrial targeting signal sequence using the MBP-His10 fusion in Escherichia coli. The recombinant FAM210A protein was inserted into the E. coli cell membrane and purified from isolated bacterial cell membranes, followed by a two-step process using Ni-NTA resin-based immobilized-metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and ion exchange purification. A pulldown assay validated the functionality of purified FAM210A protein interacting with human mitochondrial elongation factor EF-Tu in HEK293T cell lysates.

    "abstract": "The ATR kinase, which coordinates cellular responses to DNA replication stress, is also essential for the proliferation of normal unstressed cells. Although its role in the replication stress response is well defined, the mechanisms by which ATR supports normal cell proliferation remain elusive. Here, we show that ATR is dispensable for the viability of G0-arrested naive B cells. However, upon cytokine-induced proliferation, Atr-deficient B cells initiate DNA replication efficiently in early S phase, but by mid-S phase they display dNTP depletion, fork stalling, and replication failure. Nonetheless, productive DNA replication can be restored in Atr-deficient cells by pathways that suppress origin firing, such as downregulation of CDC7 and CDK1 kinase activities. Together, these findings indicate that ATR supports the proliferation of normal unstressed cells by tempering the pace of origin firing during the early S phase to avoid exhaustion of dNTPs and other replication factors.",

    "abstract": "BIG (also known as DOC1 and TIR3) is an 0.5 MDa protein that has been associated with multiple important functions in signalling and development through forward genetic screens in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the biochemical function(s) of BIG are unknown. Here, we investigated whether BIG plays a role in the Arg/N-degron pathways, protein regulatory mechanisms in which substrate protein fate is influenced by the N-terminal (Nt) residue. In Arabidopsis, PROTEOLYSIS1 (PRT1) is an E3 ligase with specificity for aromatic amino acids, whereas PROTEOLYSIS6 (PRT6) targets basic N-terminal residues. We crossed a big loss-of-function allele to prt6 and prt1 mutants and examined the stability of protein substrates. Stability of model N-degron pathway substrates was enhanced in prt6-1 big-2 and prt1-1 big-2 relative to the respective single mutants. Abundance of the PRT6 physiological substrates, HYPOXIA RESPONSIVE ERF (HRE)2 and VERNALIZATION (VRN)2 was similarly increased in prt6 big double mutants, without increase in transcripts. Accordingly, hypoxia marker expression was enhanced in prt6 big double mutants, in a manner requiring arginyltransferase activity and RAP-type ERFVII transcription factors. Transcriptomic analysis of roots not only demonstrated synergistically increased expression of a plethora of hypoxia responsive genes in the double mutant relative to prt6 but also revealed other roles for PRT6 and BIG, including regulation of suberin deposition through both ERFVII-dependent and independent mechanisms, respectively. Our results show that BIG acts together with PRT6 to regulate the hypoxia response and wider processes.\n\nSignificance StatementThe N-degron pathways are a group of protein regulatory mechanisms that play important roles in plant growth, development, and response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Despite rapid progress in the last decade, key enzymatic components of the pathways remain to be identified. BIG (also known as DOC1 and TIR3) is a protein of approximately 0.5 MDa, associated with multiple, distinct roles in plants but the precise biochemical functions of this protein have remained enigmatic until now. Here we identify BIG as a new component of plant N-degron pathways that acts together with the N-recognin E3 ligase PROTEOLYSIS6 (PRT6) to control the hypoxia response and other functions in Arabidopsis thaliana.",

    "abstract": "Common respiratory diseases continue to represent a major public health problem, and much of the morbidity and mortality is due to airway inflammation and mucus production. Our previous work identified a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) known as MAPK13 that is activated in airway disease and is required for mucus production in human cell-culture models. However, only weak first-generation MAPK13 inhibitors were made to confirm gene-knockdown function, and there was no extension to effectiveness in vivo. Here we report the discovery of a first-in-class MAPK13 inhibitor (designated NuP-3) that down-regulates type-2 cytokine-stimulated mucus production in air-liquid interface and organoid cultures of human airway epithelial cells. We also show that NuP-3 treatment effectively attenuates respiratory inflammation and mucus production in new minipig models of airway disease after type-2 cytokine challenge or respiratory viral infection. Treatment also down-regulates biomarkers linked to basal-epithelial stem cell activation as an upstream site for target engagement. The results thereby provide proof-of-concept for a novel small-molecule kinase inhibitor to modify as yet uncorrected features of respiratory airway disease including stem cell reprogramming towards inflammation and mucus production.",

    "abstract": "Tumor-associated neutrophils are found in many types of cancer and are often reported to contribute to negative outcomes. The presence of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-{beta}) in the tumor microenvironment reportedly contributes to the skewing of neutrophils to a more pro-tumor phenotype. The effects of TGF-{beta} on neutrophil signaling and migration are, however, unclear. We sought to characterize TGF-{beta} signaling in both primary human neutrophils and the neutrophil-like cell line HL-60 and determine whether it directly induces neutrophil migration. We found that TGF-{beta}1 does not induce neutrophil chemotaxis in transwell or underagarose migration assays. TGF-{beta}1 does activate canonical signaling through SMAD3 and noncanonical signaling through ERK1/2 in neutrophils in a time-and dose-dependent manner. Additionally, TGF-{beta}1 present in the tumor-conditioned media (TCM) of invasive breast cancer cells results in SMAD3 activation. We discovered that TCM induces neutrophils to secrete leukotriene B4 (LTB4), which is a lipid mediator important for amplifying the range of neutrophil recruitment. However, TGF-{beta}1 alone does not induce secretion of LTB4. RNA-sequencing revealed that TGF-{beta}1 and TCM alter gene expression in HL-60 cells, including the mRNA levels of the pro-tumor oncostatin M (OSM) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). These new insights into the role and impact of TGF-{beta}1 on neutrophil signaling, migration, and gene expression have significant implications in the understanding of the changes in neutrophils that occur in the tumor microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "In most vertebrates, oviducts are derived from Mullerian ducts and sperm ducts from Wolffian ducts. In teleosts, however, Mullerian ducts are absent. Wolffian ducts function as nephric ducts in both sexes, and genital ducts are formed by posterior extension of either ovaries or testes. Whether genital ducts of teleosts are newly evolved organs or are a variant of the Mullerian ducts is an important question for evolutionary mechanisms of morphogenesis. One of the genes essential for Mullerian duct formation in mice, wnt4, is expressed in the mesenchyme and induces invagination of the coelomic epithelium and its posterior elongation. Here, we approached to the above question by examining genital duct development in mutants of two Wnt4 genes in medaka (wnt4a is orthologous to mouse wnt4 and wnt4b paralogous). The wnt4b mutants had short body but were fertile with normal genital ducts. In contrast, both male and female wnt4a mutants had posterior elongation of the gonads stopped within or just outside the coelom, depending on the mutated alleles. Genetic females of the scl mutants (unable to synthesize testosterone or estrogens) have gonads containing both previtellogenic oocytes and spermatogenic cysts. Their gonads do not have ovarian cavities or sperm duct primordia and are lacking genital ducts completely. The results suggest Wnt4a target organs are posterior parts of the ovarian cavities or the sperm duct primordia. Medaka wnt4a was expressed in the mesenchyme ventral to the genital ducts in both sexes. Thus, the aborted elongation of genital ducts in the wnt4a mutants, the ortholog of mouse wnt4, suggests strongly that mouse Mullerian ducts and teleost genital ducts share homologous developmental processes. To further demonstrate this possible homology, mechanisms of genital duct formation and possible roles of Wnt4 should be compared before and after the appearance of Mullerian ducts in vertebrate phylogeny, namely jawless fish and cartilaginous fish. Additionally, wnt4a and wnt4b single mutants or double mutants did not show sex-reversal, suggesting both genes are dispensable for gonadal sex differentiation in medaka. This is in contrast to indispensable function of Wnt4 in mammalian ovarian differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common and progressive spinal deformity in children that exhibits striking sexual dimorphism, with girls at more than five-fold greater risk of severe disease compared to boys. Despite its medical impact, the molecular mechanisms that drive AIS are largely unknown. We previously defined a female-specific AIS genetic risk locus in an enhancer near the PAX1 gene. Here we sought to define the roles of PAX1 and newly-identified AIS-associated genes in the developmental mechanism of AIS. In a genetic study of 9,161 individuals with AIS and 80,731 unaffected controls, significant association was identified with a variant in COL11A1 encoding collagen (1) XI (rs3753841; NM_080629_c.4004C>T; p.(Pro1335Leu); P=7.07e-11, OR=1.118). Using CRISPR mutagenesis we generated Pax1 knockout mice (Pax1-/-). In postnatal spines we found that Pax1 and collagen (1) XI protein both localize within the intervertebral disc (IVD)-vertebral junction region encompassing the growth plate, with less collagen (1) XI detected in Pax1-/- spines compared to wildtype. By genetic targeting we found that wildtype Col11a1 expression in growth plate cells (GPCs) suppresses expression of Pax1 and of Mmp3, encoding the matrix metalloproteinase 3 enzyme implicated in matrix remodeling. However, this suppression was abrogated in the presence of the AIS-associated COL11A1P1335L mutant. Further, we found that either knockdown of the estrogen receptor gene Esr2, or tamoxifen treatment, significantly altered Col11a1 and Mmp3 expression in GPCs. These studies support a new molecular model of AIS pathogenesis wherein genetic variation and estrogen signaling increase disease susceptibility by altering a Pax1-Col11a1-Mmp3 signaling axis in the growth plate.",

    "abstract": "Dozens of variants in the photoreceptor-specific transcription factor (TF) CRX are linked with different human blinding diseases that vary in their severity and age of onset. How different variants in a single TF cause a range of pathological phenotypes is not understood. We deployed massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to measure changes to CRX cis-regulatory function in live mouse retinas carrying knock-ins of two phenotypically distinct human disease-causing Crx variants, one in the DNA binding domain (p.R90W) and the other in the transcriptional effector domain (p.E168d2). We found that the effects of CRX variants on global cis-regulatory activity patterns correspond with the severity of their phenotypes. The variants affect similar sets of enhancers but to different degrees. A subset of silencers were converted to enhancers in retinas lacking a functional CRX effector domain, but were unaffected by p.R90W. Episomal MPRA activities of CRX-bound sequences showed some correspondence with chromatin environments at their original genomic loci, including an enrichment of silencers and depletion of strong enhancers among distal elements whose accessibility increases later in retinal development. Many distal silencers were de-repressed by p.E168d2, but not by p.R90W, suggesting that loss of developmentally timed silencing caused by p.E168d2 may contribute to phenotypic differences between the two variants. Our findings indicate that phenotypically distinct disease variants in different domains of CRX have partially overlapping effects on its cis-regulatory function, leading to mis-regulation of similar sets of enhancers, while having a qualitatively different impact on silencers.",

    "abstract": "Balanced biosynthesis is the hallmark of bacterial cell physiology, where the concentrations of stable proteins remain steady. However, this poses a conceptual challenge to modeling the cell-cycle and cell-size controls in bacteria, as prevailing concentration-based eukaryote models are not directly applicable. In this study, we revisit and significantly extend the initiator-titration model, proposed thirty years ago, and explain how bacteria precisely and robustly control replication initiation based on the mechanism of protein copy-number sensing. Using a mean-field approach, we first derive an analytical expression of the cell size at initiation based on three biological mechanistic control parameters for an extended initiator-titration model. We also study the stability of our model analytically and show that initiation can become unstable in multifork replication conditions. Using simulations, we further show that the presence of the conversion between active and inactive initiator protein forms significantly represses initiation instability. Importantly, the two-step Poisson process set by the initiator titration step results in significantly improved initiation synchrony with CV [~] 1/N scaling rather than the standard [Formula] scaling in the Poisson process, where N is the total number of initiators required for initiation. Our results answer two long-standing questions in replication initiation: (1) Why do bacteria produce almost two orders of magnitude more DnaA, the master initiator proteins, than required for initiation? (2) Why does DnaA exist in active (DnaA-ATP) and inactive (DnaA-ADP) forms if only the active form is competent for initiation? The mechanism presented in this work provides a satisfying general solution to how the cell can achieve precision control without sensing protein concentrations, with broad implications from evolution to the design of synthetic cells.",

    "abstract": "Transposable element activity has greatly impacted the evolution of Kochia scoparia syn. Bassia scoparia (kochia), an important agricultural weed. In this study, an improved kochia genome assembly of the glyphosate-susceptible line 7710 was analyzed in comparison to a glyphosate-resistant line, M32. A near complete genome assembly consisting of 14 super-scaffolds with a total length of 969.6 Mb, and N50 scaffold length of 99.88 Mb, was generated with hybrid short-read (Illumina), and singlemolecule (PacBio/Bionano genomics) data, in addition to chromatin interaction mapping (Hi-C). The 9 largest scaffolds corresponded to the 9 chromosomes of a close relative, Beta vulgaris. From this assembly, 54,387 protein-coding gene loci were annotated. After gene annotation it was revealed that 58% of the whole-genome consisted of transposable elements. We identified that gene families containing FHY3 (FAR-Red Elongated Hypocotyl 3) and FAR1 (FAR-Red Impaired Response 1) functional domains have undergone a massive Bassia-lineage specific expansion. FHY3 and FAR1 domains were first described as a \"domesticated\" (non-active) sub-type of Mutator Don-Robertson transposase (MuDR) that function as transcription factors; however, the domains may still function as transposases in the correct genomic context, but this has yet to be observed. Mutator elements are associated with large DNA segmental transposition within the genome including gene duplication events, which can greatly influence plant phenotypes and evolution. We discovered in our work that putative MuDR elements with detectable FHY3/FAR1 domains were tightly associated with segmental duplications of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) that confer resistance to the herbicide glyphosate. Further, in a case study of MuDR activity, we characterized a new MuDR subtype, named here as \"Muntjac\", which contributes to the evolution of herbicide resistance in kochia through the process of transduplication. Collectively, our study provides insights into the de-domestication of a FHY3/FAR1 transposon and provides new perspectives on the evolution of glyphosate resistance in kochia.",
