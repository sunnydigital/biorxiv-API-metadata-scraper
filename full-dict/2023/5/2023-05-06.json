    "abstract": "Tpp49Aa1 from Lysinibacillus sphaericus is a Toxin_10 family protein that - in combination with Cry48Aa1, a 3-domain crystal protein - has potent mosquitocidal activity, specifically against Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. MHz serial femtosecond crystallography at a nano-focused X-ray free electron laser, allowed rapid and high-quality data collection to determine the Tpp49Aa1 structure at 1.62 [A] resolution from native nanocrystals. This revealed the packing of Tpp49Aa1 within these nanocrystals, isolated from sporulated bacteria, as a homodimer with a large intermolecular interface, shedding light on natural crystallization. Complementary experiments conducted at varied pH also enabled investigations of the early structural events leading up to the dissolution of natural Tpp49Aa1 crystals. Using modelling, we propose a potential interaction between Tpp49Aa1 and Cry48Aa1 that may play a role in their codependency and broaden our understanding of this two-component system. We expand the known target range, demonstrating Tpp49Aa1/Cry48Aa1 susceptibility of larvae from Anopheles stephensi, Aedes albopictus and Culex tarsalis - substantially increasing the potential use of this toxin pair in mosquito control. Further functional insights are gained using Culex cell lines to characterise cellular models for future investigations into Cry48Aa1/Tpp49Aa1 mechanism of action and to demonstrate transient detrimental effects of individual toxin components.\n\nSignificance StatementThe Tpp49Aa1/Cry48Aa1 protein pair kills mosquito larvae. Innovative use of nano-focused X-ray free electron laser to match the size of natural Tpp49Aa1 nanocrystals and the highest beam intensity available in any XFEL for high-throughput data collection, allowed structural resolution to 1.62 [A].\n\nTpp proteins show a range of interactions with different partners to elicit toxicity. To gain insight into Tpp49Aa1, its interaction with Cry48Aa1 was modelled. We also establish cell-based assays of Tpp49Aa1/Cry48Aa1 activity.\n\nWe expand the known target range to include three more mosquito species: Anopheles stephensi, Aedes albopictus and Culex tarsalis. This study will underpin future Tpp mode of action investigations and aid insecticide optimization against mosquito vectors of emerging diseases such as West Nile Virus and malaria.",

    "abstract": "Proximity labeling with genetically encoded enzymes is widely used to study protein-protein interactions in cells. However, the resolution and accuracy of proximity labeling methods are limited by a lack of control over the enzymatic labeling process. Here, we present a high spatial and temporal resolution technology that can be activated on demand using light, for high accuracy proximity labeling. Our system, called Light Activated BioID (LAB), is generated by fusing the two halves of the split-TurboID proximity labeling enzyme to the photodimeric proteins CRY2 and CIB1. Using live cell imaging, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and mass spectrometry, we show that upon exposure to blue light, CRY2 and CIB1 dimerize, reconstitute the split-TurboID enzyme, and biotinylate proximate proteins. Turning off the light halts the biotinylation reaction. We validate LAB in different cell types and demonstrate that it can identify known binding partners of proteins while reducing background labeling and false positives.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules and molecular motors are essential components of the cellular cytoskeleton, driving fundamental processes in vivo, including chromosome segregation and cargo transport. When reconstituted in vitro, these cytoskeletal proteins serve as energy-consuming building blocks to study the self-organization of active matter. Cytoskeletal active gels display rich emergent dynamics, including extensile flows, locally contractile asters, and bulk contraction. However, how the protein-protein interaction kinetics set their contractile or extensile nature is unclear. Here, we explore the origin of the transition from extensile bundles to contractile asters in a minimal reconstituted system composed of stabilized microtubules, depletant, ATP, and clusters of kinesin-1 motors. We show that the microtubule binding and unbinding kinetics of highly processive motor clusters set their ability to end-accumulate, which can drive polarity sorting of the microtubules and aster formation. We further demonstrate that the microscopic time scale of end-accumulation sets the emergent time scale of aster formation. Finally, we show that biochemical regulation is insufficient to explain fully the transition as generic aligning interactions through depletion, crosslinking, or excluded volume interactions can drive bundle formation, despite the presence of end-accumulating motors. The extensile-to-contractile transition is well captured by a simple self-assembly model where nematic and polar aligning interactions compete to form either bundles or asters. Starting from a five-dimensional organization phase space, we identify a single control parameter given by the ratio of the different component concentrations that dictates the material-scale organization. Overall, this work shows that the interplay of biochemical and mechanical tuning at the microscopic level controls the robust self-organization of active cytoskeletal materials.\n\nSignificance statementSelf-organization in living cells is often driven by energy-consuming motor proteins that push and pull on a network of cytoskeletal filaments. However, it is unclear how to connect the emergent structure and dynamics of reconstituted cytoskeletal materials to the kinetics and mechanics of their microscopic building blocks. Here, we systematically correlate bulk structure with asymmetry of the motor distribution along single filaments to explain the transition from extensile bundles to contractile asters in active networks of stabilized microtubules crosslinked by motor proteins. We combine experiments and scaling arguments to identify a single number that predicts how the system will self-organize. This work shows that biochemical and mechanical interactions compete to set the emergent structure of active biomimetic gels.",

    "abstract": "The physical body of an organism serves as a vital interface for interactions with its environment. Here we investigated the impact of human body size on the perception of action possibilities (affordances) offered by the environment. We found that the body size delineated a distinct boundary on affordances, dividing objects of continuous real-world sizes into two discrete categories with each affording distinct action sets. Additionally, the boundary shifted with imagined body sizes, suggesting a causal link between body size and affordance perception. Intriguingly, ChatGPT, a large language model lacking physical embodiment, exhibited a modest yet comparable affordance boundary at the scale of human body size, suggesting the boundary is not exclusively derived from organism-environment interactions. A subsequent fMRI experiment showed that only the affordances of objects within the range of body size were represented in the brain, suggesting that objects capable of being manipulated are the only objects capable of offering affordance in the eyes of an organism. In summary, our study suggests a novel definition of object-ness in an affordance-based context, advocating the concept of embodied cognition in understanding the emergence of intelligence constrained by an organisms physical attributes.",

    "abstract": "Type 9 secretion system (T9SS) is one of the least characterized secretion systems exclusively found in the Bacteroidetes phylum which comprise various environmental and economically relevant bacteria. While T9SS plays a central role in bacterial movement termed gliding motility, survival and pathogenicity, there is an unmet need for a comprehensive tool that predicts T9SS, gliding motility and proteins secreted via T9SS. In this study, we develop such a computational tool, Type 9 secretion system and Gliding motility Prediction (T9GPred). To build this tool, we manually curated published experimental evidence and identified mandatory components for T9SS and gliding motility prediction. We also compiled experimentally characterized proteins secreted via T9SS and determined the presence of three unique types of C-terminal domain signals, and these insights were leveraged to predict proteins secreted via T9SS. Notably, using recently published experimental evidence, we show that T9GPred has high predictive power. Thus, we used T9GPred to predict the presence of T9SS, gliding motility and associated secreted proteins across 693 completely sequenced Bacteroidetes strains. T9GPred predicted 402 strains to have T9SS, of which 327 strains are also predicted to exhibit gliding motility. Further, T9GPred also predicted putative secreted proteins for the 402 strains. In a nutshell, T9GPred is a novel computational tool for systems-level prediction of T9SS and streamlining future experimentation. The source code of the computational tool is available in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/asamallab/T9GPred. The tool and its predicted results are compiled in a web server available at: https://cb.imsc.res.in/t9gpred/.",

Here, using fMRI-measured brain responses to 1,000 diverse sentences, we develop a GPT-based encoding model and use this model to identify new sentences that are predicted to drive or suppress responses in the human language network. We demonstrate that these model-selected novel sentences indeed drive and suppress activity of human language areas in new individuals (86% increase and 98% decrease relative to the average response to diverse naturalistic sentences). A systematic analysis of the model-selected sentences reveals that surprisal and well-formedness of linguistic input are key determinants of response strength in the language network.

    "abstract": "The tick Ixodes ricinus is the most important vector species of infectious diseases in European France. Understanding its distribution, phenology, and host species use, along with the distribution and prevalence of associated pathogens at national scales is essential for developing prevention strategies. The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic map and narrative review of the existing knowledge on the eco-epidemiology of I. ricinus in France. Using literature published up to 2020, the present paper provides a distribution map for the species and a summary of environmental factors explaining observed geographical differences in phenology and temporal differences in abundance. The diversity of vertebrate host species used by this tick, along with their degree of infestation when available, are presented and discussed with respect to their potential contribution to the population dynamics of I. ricinus and the circulation of tick-borne zoonotic pathogens. Prevalence data of detected pathogens are summarised in different maps. Results from 187 identified references show that the species is present in most departments, but scarce under Mediterranean climate and in coastal habitats. Its phenology is generally bimodal with variations depending on climate. Abundance seems positively influenced by forest cover and host abundance. Rodents and ruminants are the most studied species groups, but the diversity of sampling protocols (e.g., location, season, exhaustivity of inspection) precluded direct comparisons between species groups. Data on pathogens are patchy, with most studies conducted near research units. Among pathogens, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato is the most searched for in ticks and seems more prevalent in north-eastern and central France. The review carried out here has made it possible to highlight the gaps in our knowledge of tick-host-pathogen interactions, their ecology and their distribution, and the need to address these gaps in order to optimize tick and tick-borne diseases prevention and control strategies.",

    "abstract": "The nutritional status during early life can have enduring effects on an animals metabolism, although the mechanisms underlying these long-term effects are still unclear. Epigenetic modifications are considered a prime candidate mechanism for encoding early-life nutritional memories during this critical developmental period. However, the extent to which these epigenetic changes occur and persist over time remains uncertain, in part due to challenges associated with directly stimulating the fetus with specific nutrients in viviparous mammalian systems. In this study, we used medaka as an oviparous vertebrate model to establish an early-life high-fat diet (HFD) model. Larvae were fed with HFD from the hatching stages (one week after fertilization) for six weeks, followed by normal chow (NC) for eight weeks until the adult stage. We examined the changes in the transcriptomic and epigenetic state of the liver over this period. We found that HFD induces fatty liver phenotypes, accompanied by drastic changes in the hepatic transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, and histone modifications, especially in metabolic genes. These changes were largely reversed after the long-term NC, demonstrating the high plasticity of the epigenetic state in hepatocytes. However, we found a certain number of genomic loci showing non-reversible epigenetic changes, especially around genes related to cell signaling, liver fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, implying persistent changes in the cellular state of the liver triggered by early-life HFD feeding. Our data provide novel insights into the epigenetic mechanism of nutritional programming and a comprehensive atlas of the long-term epigenetic state in an early-life HFD model of non-mammalian vertebrates.",

In addition, smaller regional variants are linked to wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders, underscoring the genes essential role in brain development. Like many essential neurodevelopmental genes, AUTS2 is large and complex, generating distinct long (AUTS2-l) and short (AUTS2-s) protein isoforms from alternative promoters. Although evidence suggests unique isoform functions, the contributions of each isoform to specific AUTS2-linked phenotypes have not been clearly resolved. Furthermore, Auts2 is widely expressed across the developing brain, but cell populations most central to disease presentation have not been determined. In this study, we focused on the specific roles of AUTS2-l in brain development, behavior, and postnatal brain gene expression, showing that brain-wide AUTS2-l ablation leads to specific subsets of the recessive pathologies associated with C-terminal mutations that disrupt both isoforms. We identify downstream genes that could explain expressed phenotypes including hundreds of putative direct AUTS2- l target genes. Furthermore, in contrast to C-terminal Auts2 mutations which lead to dominant hypoactivity, AUTS2-l loss-of-function is associated with dominant hyperactivity, a phenotype exhibited by many human patients. Finally, we show that AUTS2-l ablation in Calbindin 1-expressing cell lineages is sufficient to yield learning/memory deficits and hyperactivity with abnormal dentate gyrus granule cell maturation, but not other phenotypic effects. These data provide new clues to in vivo AUTS2-l functions and novel information relevant to genotype-phenotype correlations in the human AUTS2 region.",

We calibrate and fit the model parameters based on well-established modeling techniques. Our results indicate that the main pathways involved in the patterning of tip and stalk endothelial cells under hypoxia differ, and the time under hypoxia affects how a reaction affects patterning. Interestingly, the interaction of receptors with Neuropilin1 is also relevant for cell patterning. Our simulations under different oxygen concentrations indicate time- and oxygen-availability-dependent responses for the two cells. Following simulations with various stimuli, our model suggests that factors such as period under hypoxia and oxygen availability must be considered for pattern control.

    "abstract": "Representations from artificial neural network (ANN) language models have been shown to predict human brain activity in the language network. To understand what aspects of linguistic stimuli contribute to ANN-to-brain similarity, we used an fMRI dataset of responses to n=627 naturalistic English sentences (Pereira et al., 2018) and systematically manipulated the stimuli for which ANN representations were extracted. In particular, we i) perturbed sentences word order, ii) removed different subsets of words, or iii) replaced sentences with other sentences of varying semantic similarity. We found that the lexical semantic content of the sentence (largely carried by content words) rather than the sentences syntactic form (conveyed via word order or function words) is primarily responsible for the ANN-to-brain similarity. In follow-up analyses, we found that perturbation manipulations that adversely affect brain predictivity also lead to more divergent representations in the ANNs embedding space and decrease the ANNs ability to predict upcoming tokens in those stimuli. Further, results are robust to whether the mapping model is trained on intact or perturbed stimuli, and whether the ANN sentence representations are conditioned on the same linguistic context that humans saw. The critical result--that lexical- semantic content is the main contributor to the similarity between ANN representations and neural ones--aligns with the idea that the goal of the human language system is to extract meaning from linguistic strings. Finally, this work highlights the strength of systematic experimental manipulations for evaluating how close we are to accurate and generalizable models of the human language network.",

    "abstract": "During neuronal activity the extracellular concentration of potassium ions ([K+]o) increases substantially above resting levels, but it remains unclear what role these [K+]o changes play in dendritic integration of synaptic inputs. We used mathematical formulations and biophysical modeling to explore the role of activity-dependent K+ changes near dendritic segments of a visual cortex pyramidal neuron, receiving synaptic inputs tuned to stimulus orientation. We found that the fine-scale spatial arrangement of inputs dictates the magnitude of [K+]o changes around the dendrites: Dendritic segments with similarly-tuned inputs can attain substantially higher [K+]o increases than segments with diversely-tuned inputs. These [K+]o elevations in turn increase dendritic excitability, leading to more robust and prolonged dendritic spikes. Ultimately, these local effects amplify the gain of neuronal input-output transformations, causing higher orientation-tuned somatic firing rates without compromising orientation selectivity. Our results suggest that local activity-dependent [K+]o changes around dendrites may act as a \"volume knob\" that determines the impact of synaptic inputs on feature-tuned neuronal firing.",

    "abstract": "This study tested the role of a cross-modal feature based attention (FBA) cue on perceptual learning and spatial transfer. The trained task was figure-ground segregation in the motion domain. The experiment involved a pre-test, ten days of training, and a post-test. Twelve visually intact participants were immersed in a virtual environment and tasked with identifying the location and motion direction of a peripheral 10{whitebullet}aperture of semi-coherently moving dots embedded at randomized locations within whole-field random dot motion. The aperture contained both randomly moving dots and signal dots which had global leftward or rightward motion. To manipulate motion coherence, a 3-up-1-down staircase adjusted the direction range of the signal dots in response to segregation judgments. The dot stimulus was preceded by a 1s white-noise spatialized auditory cue emitted from the fixation point (neutral group), or from an emitter moving in the direction of signal dots at 80{whitebullet}/s in a horizontal arc centered on the fixation point (FBA cue group). Visual feedback indicated the selected and true aperture locations, and correctness of the motion direction judgment. Analysis measured MD discrimination within the aperture as well as segregation ability, both measured in terms of direction range threshold (DRT). At trained locations, MD DRT improved similarly in FBA and neutral groups, and learning was retained when the pre-cue was removed ({Delta}DRT from pretest to posttest: 61{+/-}10{whitebullet}(SD) FBA, 74{+/-}10{whitebullet}neutral), and transferred to untrained locations (41{+/-}10{whitebullet}FBA, 45{+/-}10{whitebullet}neutral). DRT for localization also improved in both groups when pre-cues were removed (49{+/-}10{whitebullet}FBA, 44{+/-}10{whitebullet}neutral), but only the FBA group showed full transfer of learning to untrained locations in the segregation task (32{+/-}10{whitebullet}FBA, 23{+/-}10{whitebullet}neutral). In summary, transfer occurred for both motion direction and segregation tasks, but the segregation transfer required the presence of the cross-modal FBA cue during training.",

    "abstract": "Actin bundling proteins crosslink filaments into polarized structures that shape and support membrane protrusions including filopodia, microvilli, and stereocilia. In the case of epithelial microvilli, mitotic spindle positioning protein (MISP) is an actin bundler that localizes specifically to the basal rootlets, where the pointed ends of core bundle filaments converge. Previous studies established that MISP is prevented from binding more distal segments of the core bundle by competition with other actin binding proteins. Yet whether MISP holds a preference for binding directly to rootlet actin remains an open question. Using in vitro TIRF microscopy assays, we found that MISP exhibits a clear binding preference for filaments enriched in ADP-actin monomers. Consistent with this, assays with actively growing actin filaments revealed that MISP binds at or near their pointed ends. Moreover, although substrate attached MISP assembles filament bundles in parallel and antiparallel configurations, in solution MISP assembles parallel bundles consisting of multiple filaments exhibiting uniform polarity. These discoveries highlight nucleotide state sensing as a mechanism for sorting actin bundlers along filaments and driving their accumulation near filament ends. Such localized binding might drive parallel bundle formation and/or locally modulate bundle mechanical properties in microvilli and related protrusions.",

Hormone injection studies and genetic removal of androgen and estrogen receptors demonstrated androgen receptor (AR) mediated regulation of gene activity in PT cells as the regulatory mechanism. Interestingly, caloric restriction feminizes the male kidney. Single-nuclear multiomic analysis identified putative cis-regulatory regions and cooperating factors mediating PT responses to AR activity in the mouse kidney. In the human kidney, a limited set of genes showed conserved sex-linked regulation while analysis of the mouse liver underscored organ-specific differences in the regulation of sexually dimorphic gene expression.

Since CNAs are not associated with dosage compensation in mRNA expression, cancer cells with a high CNA burden must harbor mechanisms to mitigate proteotoxic stress resulting from stoichiometric imbalance and accumulation of unfolded proteins (1). Here, we show that aneuploid human cancer cells exhibit discordance between CNAs and protein levels due to compensation at the proteome level, mainly concerning multi-protein complexes. Moreover, we identify the N-recognin ubiquitin ligase UBR4 as a critical mediator of protein interactome homeostasis that is essential for viability, specifically in highly aneuploid cancers in vitro and in vivo. UBR4 prunes the proteome to ensure the balanced expression of protein complex members. Inactivation of UBR4 in highly aneuploid cancer cells causes a convergence of copy number and protein levels and induces proteotoxic stress pathways. UBR4 inhibition may present a broadly applicable therapeutic strategy for cancer and other diseases driven by aneuploidy.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryThe N-recognin ubiquitin ligase UBR4 as a critical mediator of protein interactome homeostasis that is essential for viability in aneuploid cancers.",

    "abstract": "Background: Men with incurable castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are typically treated with taxanes; however, drug resistance rapidly develops. Thus, overcoming taxane resistant PC is a major clinical need. We previously identified a seven gene network in aggressive CRPC, which includes the mitotic serine threonine kinase BUB1, a major regulator of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Alterations in mitotic kinases (and SAC malfunction) are associated with advanced PC and taxane resistance development and thereby represent potential vulnerabilities.\n\nMethods: We evaluated BUB1 expression in publicly available data sets and in existing and newly generated taxane resistant PC cells. The effects of BUB1 depletion on the growth of a panel of PC and non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cells was determined. We examined the capacity of pharmacologic inhibition of BUB1 kinase to reverse taxane-resistant PC growth. We evaluated the role of the prevalent androgen receptor variant AR-V7, in regulating BUB1 expression and taxane resistance.\n\nResults: BUB1 mRNA was over-expressed in PC, metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and in tumors of patients treated with taxane-based chemotherapeutics compared to benign prostate tissue. Furthermore, BUB1 levels were elevated in taxane resistant PC cell lines compared to their sensitive counterparts. BUB1 depletion decreased growth of CRPC cells through delayed mitosis but did not affect proliferation of androgen dependent (ADPC) or non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cells. Furthermore, BUB1 inhibition with the specific kinase inhibitor, BAY1816032, re-sensitized taxane resistant CRPC cells to the clinically used drugs, docetaxel and cabazitaxel. Consistent with AR-V7 regulation of BUB1, we also found that AR-V7 was elevated in taxane resistant CRPC cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of AR-V7 in CRPC cells that lack this protein resulted in increased BUB1 and conferred docetaxel resistance. BUB1 pharmacologic inhibition in combination with taxanes sensitized AR-V7 expressing CRPC cells to docetaxel treatment.\n\nConclusion: These data support BUB1 as an exploitable and therapeutically tractable vulnerability in taxane resistant CRPC including in AR variant driven CRPC.",

By combining molecular modeling with electrophysiological recordings, we identified amino acids involved in the dynamic entry pathway and the binding of VUAA1 to Drosophila melanogasters odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco). Our results provide new evidence for the exact location of the agonist binding site and a detailed and original mechanism of ligand translocation controlled by a network of conserved residues.

HLB is primarily spread by the insect vector Diaphorina citri (Asian Citrus Psyllid). To counteract the rapid spread of HLB by D. citri, traditional vector control strategies such as insecticide sprays, the release of natural predators, and mass introductions of natural parasitoids are used. However, these methods alone have not managed to contain the spread of disease. To further expand the available tools for D. citri control via generating specific modifications of the D. citri genome, we have developed protocols for CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic modification. Until now, genome editing in D. citri has been challenging due to the general fragility and size of D.citri eggs. Here we present optimized methods for collecting and preparing eggs to introduce the Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) into early embryos and alternative methods (ReMOT Control) for injecting RNP into the hemocoel of adult females for ovarian transduction. Using these methods, we have generated visible somatic mutations, indicating their suitability for gene editing in D. citri. These methods represent the first steps towards advancing D. citri research in preparation for future genetic-based systems for controlling HLB.",

Heterodimer structures of {gamma}c TMD bound to the TMDs of IL-7R and IL-9R, determined in near lipid bilayer environment, reveal a conserved knob-into-hole mechanism of recognition that mediates receptor sharing within the membrane.

    "abstract": "Pyroptosis and apoptosis are two forms of regulated cell death that can defend against intracellular infection. Although pyroptosis and apoptosis have distinct signaling pathways, when a cell fails to complete pyroptosis, backup pathways will initiate apoptosis. Here, we investigated the utility of apoptosis compared to pyroptosis in defense against an intracellular bacterial infection. We previously engineered Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to persistently express flagellin, and thereby activate NLRC4 during systemic infection in mice. The resulting pyroptosis clears this flagellin-engineered strain. We now show that infection of caspase-1 or gasdermin D deficient macrophages by this flagellin-engineered S. Typhimurium induces apoptosis in vitro. Additionally, we also now engineer S. Typhimurium to translocate the pro-apoptotic BH3 domain of BID, which also triggers apoptosis in macrophages in vitro. In both engineered strains, apoptosis occurred somewhat slower than pyroptosis. During mouse infection, the apoptotic pathway successfully cleared these engineered S. Typhimurium from the intestinal niche, but failed to clear the bacteria from the myeloid niche in the spleen or lymph nodes. In contrast, the pyroptotic pathway was beneficial in defense of both niches. In order to clear an infection, distinct cell types may have specific tasks that they must complete before they die. In some cells, either apoptotic or pyroptotic signaling may initiate the same tasks, whereas in other cell types these modes of cell death may lead to different tasks that may not be identical in defense against infection. We recently suggested that such diverse tasks can be considered as different cellular \"bucket lists\" to be accomplished before a cell dies.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells experiencing hypoxic stress employ Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) to undergo metastasis through rewiring chromatin landscape, epigenetics, and importantly alternative splicing. Here, we investigated the role of CTCF, chromatin, epigenetic and alternative splicing modulator under hypoxia to promote EMT. Our result shows that hypoxia-induced epigenetic changes upregulate CTCF expression in breast cancer. We delineate that CTCF is a direct target of HIF1 and the hypoxia-induced HIF1-CTCF axis functionally contributes to promoting EMT in breast cancer cells. Finally, our work uncovers COL5A1, an EMT gene, as a direct target of CTCF. We demonstrated that hypoxia-mediated CTCF enrichment on COL5A1 promoter regulates expression as well as alternative splicing events to promote EMT. Here, we put forward an intricate mechanism of alternative splicing where CTCF-mediated promoter-exon upstream looping regulates DNA de-methylation and CTCF-mediated RNA Pol II pausing at COL5A1 exon 64A. Our global analysis of CTCF-ChIP-seq data reveals that the hypoxia-induced differential CTCF occupancy possibly regulates gene expression and alternative splicing events of many genes that are enriched in the EMT pathway, cancer cell motility and invasion, angiogenesis, and stemness under hypoxia, similarly to the proposed model. Finally, we employed the epigenetic modulator dCas9-DNMT3A system to specifically disrupt HIF1 or CTCF binding under hypoxia and hence the HIF1-CTCF-COL5A1exon64A axis that alleviates the EMT potential of breast cancer cells that may represent a novel therapeutic target in breast cancer.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=180 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/539689v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e15c15org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1649a71org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d77481org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@21f148_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphical AbstractC_FLOATNO C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Stalled ribosomes are rescued by pathways that recycle the ribosome and target the nascent polypeptide for degradation. In E. coli, these pathways are triggered by ribosome collisions through recruitment of SmrB, a nuclease that cleaves the mRNA. In B. subtilis, the related protein MutS2 was recently implicated in ribosome rescue. Here we show that MutS2 is recruited to collisions by its SMR and KOW domains and reveal the interaction of these domains with collided ribosomes by cryo-EM. Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches, we show that MutS2 uses its ABC ATPase activity to split ribosomes, targeting the nascent peptide for degradation by the ribosome quality control pathway. Notably, we see no evidence of mRNA cleavage by MutS2, nor does it promote ribosome rescue by tmRNA as SmrB cleavage does in E. coli. These findings clarify the biochemical and cellular roles of MutS2 in ribosome rescue in B. subtilis and raise questions about how these pathways function differently in various bacteria.",

TIP60 typically localizes to the nucleus in a punctate foci pattern, although defining factors and mechanisms regulating the assembly of TIP60 foci and their spatial distribution inside the nucleus are not understood. In the present study, we report that TIP60 can undergo phase separation to form liquid like droplets in the nuclear compartment, which is facilitated by the presence of an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) located between its chromodomain and catalytic domain. Importantly, we identified that autoacetylation on lysine 187, located within the IDR region of TIP60, is important for nuclear localization, oligomer formation and phase separation. Finally, we observed that the phase separation of TIP60 promotes its interaction with its partner proteins and actively contribute to its cellular functions.",

Here, we systematically replaced individual replicative human histones with non-replicative human variant histones using a histone replacement system in yeast. Variants H2A.J, TsH2B, and H3.5 complemented for their respective replicative counterparts. However, macroH2A1 failed to complement and its expression was toxic in yeast, negatively interacting with native yeast histones and kinetochore genes. To isolate yeast with \"macroH2A1 chromatin\" we decoupled the effects of its macro and histone fold domains, which revealed that both domains sufficed to override native yeast nucleosome positioning. Furthermore, both modified constructs of macroH2A1 exhibited lower nucleosome occupancy that correlated with decreased short-range chromatin interactions (<20 Kb), disrupted centromeric clustering, and increased chromosome instability. While supporting viability, macroH2A1 dramatically alters chromatin organization in yeast, leading to genome instability and massive fitness defects.",

These well-conserved properties allowed \"humanization\" of the nucleosome core particle (NCP) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae at high fitness costs. Here we studied nucleosome-humanized yeast-genomes to understand how species-specific chromatin affects nuclear organization and function. We found a size increase in human-NCP, linked to shorter free linker DNA, supporting decreased chromatin accessibility. 3-D humanized-genome maps showed increased chromatin compaction and defective centromere clustering, correlated with high chromosomal aneuploidy rate. Site-specific chromatin alterations were associated with lack of initiation of early origins of replication and dysregulation of the ribosomal (rDNA and rRNA) metabolism. This latter led to nucleolar fragmentation and rDNA-array instability, through a non-coding RNA dependent mechanism, leading to its extraordinary, but entirely reversible, intra-chromosomal expansion. Overall, our results reveal species-specific properties of the NCP that define epigenome function across vast evolutionary distances.\n\nHighlightsHumanized nucleosomes wrap 10 additional nucleotides, shortening free linker length\n\nHistone-humanized nucleosomes have increased occupancy for DNA\n\nHumanized nucleosomes potentially decrease chromatin accessibility by blocking-out free linker DNA\n\nNucleosome humanization impedes DNA replication by affecting chromatin structure at origins\n\nHumanized nucleosomes reversibly destabilize the ribosomal DNA array and leads to massive intrachromosomal rDNA locus expansion\n\nHistone humanization disrupts rDNA silencing and leads to nucleolar fragmentation",

    "abstract": "Transmission of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) from one cell generation to the next plays a key role in regulating cellular identity in mammalian development and diseases. While recent work has shown that the activity of DNMT1, the protein responsible for the stable inheritance of 5mC from mother to daughter cells, is imprecise; it remains unclear how the fidelity of DNMT1 is tuned in different genomic and cell state contexts. Here we describe Dyad-seq, a method that combines enzymatic detection of modified cytosines with nucleobase conversion techniques to quantify the genome-wide methylation status of cytosines at the resolution of individual CpG dinucleotides. We find that the fidelity of DNMT1-mediated maintenance methylation is directly related to the local density of DNA methylation, and for genomic regions that are lowly methylated, histone modifications can dramatically alter the maintenance methylation activity. Further, to gain deeper insights into the methylation and demethylation turnover dynamics, we extended Dyad-seq to quantify all combinations of 5mC and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at individual CpG dyads to show that TET proteins preferentially hydroxymethylate only one of the two 5mC sites in a symmetrically methylated CpG dyad rather than sequentially convert both 5mC to 5hmC. To understand how cell state transitions impact DNMT1-mediated maintenance methylation, we scaled the method down and combined it with the measurement of mRNA to simultaneously quantify genome-wide methylation levels, maintenance methylation fidelity and the transcriptome from the same cell (scDyad&T-seq). Applying scDyad&T-seq to mouse embryonic stem cells transitioning from serum to 2i conditions, we observe dramatic and heterogenous demethylation and the emergence of transcriptionally distinct subpopulations that are closely linked to the cell-to-cell variability in loss of DNMT1-mediated maintenance methylation activity, with regions of the genome that escape 5mC reprogramming retaining high levels of maintenance methylation fidelity. Overall, our results demonstrate that while distinct cell states can substantially impact the genome-wide activity of the DNA methylation maintenance machinery, locally there exists an intrinsic relationship between DNA methylation density, histone modifications and DNMT1-mediated maintenance methylation fidelity that is independent of cell state.",

Here, we investigated the role of these buried CLs in the carrier using yeast Aac2 as a model. We introduced negatively charged mutations into each CL-binding site of Aac2 to disrupt the CL interactions via electrostatic repulsion. While all mutations disturbing the CL-protein interaction destabilized Aac2 monomeric structure, transport activity was impaired in a pocket-specific manner. Finally, we determined that a disease-associated missense mutation in one CL-binding site in ANT1 compromised its structure and transport activity, resulting in OXPHOS defects.

    "abstract": "Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with adsorbed single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) are applied as sensors to investigate biological systems, with applications ranging from clinical diagnostics to agricultural biotechnology. Unique ssDNA sequences render SWCNTs selectively responsive to target analytes. However, it remains unclear how the ssDNA conformation on the SWCNT surface contributes to their ultimate functionality, as observations have been constrained to computational models or experiments under dehydrated states that differ substantially from the aqueous biological environments in which the nanosensors are applied. Herein, we demonstrate a direct mode of measuring in-solution ssDNA geometries on SWCNTs via X-ray scattering interferometry (XSI), which leverages the interference pattern produced by AuNP tags conjugated to ssDNA on the SWCNT surface. We employ XSI to quantify distinct surface-adsorbed morphologies for two ssDNA oligomer lengths, conformational changes as a function of ionic strength, and the mechanism of dopamine sensing for a previously established ssDNA-SWCNT nanosensor, with corresponding ab initio modeling for visualization. We show that the shorter oligomer, (GT)6, adopts a highly ordered structure of stacked rings along the SWCNT axis, compared to the longer, less periodic (GT)15 wrapping. The presence of dopamine elicits a simultaneous axial elongation and radial constriction of the ssDNA closer to the SWCNT surface. Application of XSI to probe solution-phase morphologies of nanoparticle-based tools will yield insights into sensing mechanisms and inform future design strategies for polymer-functionalized SWCNT technologies.",

We subjected 32 tumor and 4 normal nucleus pulposus (NP) samples to profiling of DNA methylation with EPIC microarrays and gene expression with RNAseq.\n\nGenome-wide DNA methylation analysis showed two distinct chordoma clusters (subtypes C and I) with different patterns of aberrant DNA methylation. C Chordomas are characterized by general hypomethylation with hypermethylation of CpG islands, while I chordomas are generally hypermethylated. These differences were reflected by distinct distribution of differentially methylated probes (DMPs). Differentially methylated regions were determined in each chordoma subtype indicating aberrant methylation in known tumor-related genes and regions encoding small RNAs in C chordomas. Correlation between methylation and expression was observed in minority of these genes. Upregulation of TBXT in chordomas appeared related to lower methylation at tumor-specific DMR in gene promoter.\n\nGene expression-based clusters of tumor samples did not overlap with DNA methylation subtypes.

A recent study reported widely-used metabolic (lactate) purification of monolayer hiPSC-CM cultures results in an ischemic cardiomyopathy-like phenotype compared to magnetic antibody-based cell sorting (MACS) purification, complicating the interpretation of studies using lactate-purified hiPSC-CMs. Herein, our objective was to determine if use of lactate relative to MACs-purified hiPSC-CMs impacts the properties of resulting hiPSC-ECTs. Therefore, hiPSC-CMs were differentiated and purified using either lactate-based media or MACS. After purification, hiPSC-CMs were combined with hiPSC-cardiac fibroblasts to create 3D hiPSC-ECT constructs maintained in culture for four weeks. There were no structural differences observed, and there was no significant difference in sarcomere length between lactate and MACS hiPSC-ECTs. Assessment of isometric twitch force, Ca2+ transients, and {beta}-adrenergic response revealed similar functional performance between purification methods. High-resolution mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics showed no significant difference in any protein pathway expression or myofilament proteoforms. Taken together, this study demonstrates lactate- and MACS-purified hiPSC-CMs generate ECTs with comparable molecular and functional properties, and suggests lactate purification does not result in an irreversible change in hiPSC-CM phenotype.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=177 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/539642v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@54b370org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d0bbc8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d847e3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@578c1b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Currently, it is unknown whether medulloblastoma dysregulates the translation of putatively oncogenic non-canonical open reading frames. To address this question, we performed ribosome profiling of 32 medulloblastoma tissues and cell lines and observed widespread non-canonical ORF translation. We then developed a step-wise approach to employ multiple CRISPR-Cas9 screens to elucidate functional non-canonical ORFs implicated in medulloblastoma cell survival. We determined that multiple lncRNA-ORFs and upstream open reading frames (uORFs) exhibited selective functionality independent of the main coding sequence. One of these, ASNSD1-uORF or ASDURF, was upregulated, associated with the MYC family oncogenes, and was required for medulloblastoma cell survival through engagement with the prefoldin-like chaperone complex. Our findings underscore the fundamental importance of non-canonical ORF translation in medulloblastoma and provide a rationale to include these ORFs in future cancer genomics studies seeking to define new cancer targets.\n\nHighlightsO_LIRibo-seq reveals widespread translation of non-canonical ORFs in medulloblastoma\nC_LIO_LIHigh-resolution CRISPR tiling reveals uORF functions in medulloblastoma\nC_LIO_LIASNSD1-uORF controls downstream pathways with the prefoldin-like complex\nC_LIO_LIASNSD1-uORF is necessary for medulloblastoma cell survival\nC_LI",
