    "abstract": "Cryptosporidiosis is a leading cause of life-threatening diarrhea in young children in resource-poor settings. Susceptibility rapidly declines with age, associated with changes in the microbiota. To explore microbial influences on susceptibility, we screened 85 microbiota- associated metabolites enriched in the adult gut for their effects on C. parvum growth in vitro. We identified eight inhibitory metabolites in three main classes: secondary bile salts/acids, a vitamin B6 precursor, and indoles. Growth restriction of C. parvum by indoles did not depend on the host aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway. Instead, treatment impaired host mitochondrial function and reduced total cellular ATP, as well as directly reduced the membrane potential in the parasite mitosome, a degenerate mitochondria. Oral administration of indoles, or reconstitution of the gut microbiota with indole producing bacteria, delayed life cycle progression of the parasite in vitro and reduced severity of C. parvum infection in mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that microbiota metabolites contribute to colonization resistance to Cryptosporidium infection.",

    "abstract": "The latent viral reservoir represents one of the major barriers of curing HIV. Focus on the \"kick and kill\" approach, in which virus expression is reactivated then cells producing virus are selectively depleted, has led to the discovery of many latency reversing agents (LRAs) that can reactivate latently integrated virus and further our understanding of the mechanisms driving HIV latency and latency reversal. Thus far, individual compounds have yet to be robust enough to work as a therapy, highlighting the importance of identifying new compounds that can act in novel pathways and synergize with known LRAs. In this study, we identified a promising LRA, NSC95397, from a screen of [~]4250 compounds in J-Lat cell lines. We validated that NSC95397 reactivates latent viral transcription and protein expression from cells with unique integration events. Cotreating cells with NSC95397 and known LRAs demonstrated that NSC95397 has the potential to synergize with different drugs, such prostratin, a PKC agonist, and SAHA, an HDAC inhibitor. By looking at multiple common markers of open chromatin, we show that NSC95397 does not increase open chromatin globally. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed that NSC95397 does not greatly change cellular transcription. Instead, NSC95397 downregulates many pathways key to metabolism, cell growth, and DNA repair - highlighting the potential of these pathways in regulating HIV latency. Overall, we identified NSC95397 as a novel LRA that does not alter global transcription, that shows potential for synergy with known LRAs, and that may act through novel pathways not previously recognized for their ability to modulate HIV latency.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYT-Cell Factors (TCFs) are the main transcriptional effectors of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. TCF responsiveness is a hallmark of self-renewal in mouse embryonic, and adult, neural stem cells (NSC). However, in vivo contribution(s) of TCF activities in long-lived NSCs are poorly understood. Granule neuron progenitors (GNP) in the upper rhombic lip (URL) are long-lived NSCs which express Atoh1 and generate cerebellar granule neurons. Using functional and transcriptomic approaches in amphibian, we demonstrate that TCFs are active in the URL, and are strictly necessary for the emergence and maintenance of the GNP germinative zone. We identify BarH-like 1 (Barhl1), a direct target of Atoh1, as a gate keeper for GNP exit from the URL, through silencing of TCF transcriptional activity. Our transcriptomic and in silico analysis identifies Barhl1/TCF URL target genes, and confirms our functional data. Our study provides in vivo evidence that inhibition of TCF repressive activity is necessary for maintenance of the URL, a long-lived neural germinative niche.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine, 5mC) is a repressive gene regulatory mark widespread in vertebrate genomes, yet the developmental dynamics in which 5mC patterns are established vary across species. While mammals undergo two rounds of global 5mC erasure, the zebrafish genome exhibits localized maternal-to-paternal 5mC remodeling, in which the sperm epigenome is inherited in the early embryo. To date, it is unclear how evolutionarily conserved such 5mC remodeling strategies are, and what their biological function is. Here, we studied 5mC dynamics during the embryonic development of sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), a jawless vertebrate which occupies a critical phylogenetic position as the sister group of the jawed vertebrates. We employed base-resolution 5mC quantification in the lamprey germline, embryonic and somatic tissues, and discovered large-scale maternal-to-paternal epigenome remodeling that affects >30% of the embryonic genome and is predominantly associated with partially methylated domains (PMDs). We further demonstrate that sequences eliminated during programmed genome rearrangement (PGR), a hallmark of lamprey embryogenesis, are hypermethylated in sperm prior to the onset of PGR. Our study thus unveils important insights into the evolutionary origins of vertebrate 5mC reprogramming, and how this process might participate in diverse developmental strategies.",

    "abstract": "How genes affect tissue scale organization remains a longstanding biological puzzle. As experimental efforts are underway to solve this puzzle via quantification of gene expression, chromatin organization, cellular structure, and tissue structure, computational modeling efforts remain far behind. To help accelerate the computational modeling efforts, we review two recent publications, the first on a cellular-based model for tissues and the second on a model of a cell nucleus that includes a lamina shell and chromatin. We then address how the two models can be combined to ultimately test multiscale hypotheses linking the chromatin scale and the tissue scale. To be concrete, we turn to an in vitro system for the brain known as a brain organoid. We provide a multiscale hypothesis to distinguish structural differences between brain organoids built from induced-pluripotent human stem cells and from induced-pluripotent gorilla and chimpanzee stem cells. Recent experiments discover that a cell fate transition from neuroepithelial cells to radial glial cells includes a new intermediate state that is delayed in human-derived brain organoids as compared to their genetically-close relatives, which significantly narrows and lengthens the cells on the apical side [1]. Additional experiments revealed that the protein ZEB2 plays a major role in the emergence of this new intermediate state with ZEB2 mRNA levels peaking at the onset of the emergence [1]. We postulate that the enhancement of ZEB2 expression driving this intermediate state is potentially due to chromatin reorganization. More precisely, there exists critical strain triggering the reorganization that is higher for human-derived stem cells, thereby resulting in a delay. Such a hypothesis can readily be tested experimentally within individual cells and within brain organoids as well as computationally to help work towards solving the gene-to-tissue organization puzzle.",

Here, we compared the transcriptome and histology of full-term placentas between native Tibetans and Han migrants. We found that the placental trophoblast shows the largest expression divergence between Tibetans and Han, and Tibetans show decreased immune response and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Remarkably, we detected a sex-biased expression divergence, where the male-infant placentas show a greater between-population difference than the female-infant placentas. The umbilical cord plays a key role in the sex-biased expression divergence, which is associated with the higher birth weight of the male newborns of Tibetans. We also identified adaptive histological changes in the male-infant placentas of Tibetans, including a larger umbilical cord vein area and wall thickness, and fewer syncytial knots. These findings provide valuable insights into the sex-biased adaptation of human populations, with significant implications for medical and genetic studies of human reproduction.",

These contribute to the sound transmission pathways in the unique echolocation process of toothed whales.

This study provides new insights into the evolutionary origin and lipid utilisation of acoustic fat bodies in harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) and Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) using comparative transcriptomics. Comprehensive gene expression analyses indicated that the acoustic fat bodies of toothed whales are composites of muscle and adipose tissues, mainly composed of intramuscular fat. The extra-mandibular fat body is a homologue of the masseter muscle. Additionally, we demonstrated that gene expression-based functional enrichments for specialised branched-chain amino acid metabolism, endocytosis, lysosomes and peroxisomes contribute to the maintenance of the unique fatty characteristics of the acoustic fat bodies of toothed whales. A trade-off occurred in the evolution of acoustic fat bodies as a result of the fatty reorganisation of head muscles involved in aquatic adaptation in toothed whales.",

    "abstract": "O_LIAnthropogenically-driven environmental changes over the past two centuries have led to severe biodiversity loss, most prominently in the form of loss of populations and individuals. Better tools are needed to assess the magnitude of these wildlife population declines. Anecdotal evidence suggests European bat populations have suffered substantial declines in the past few centuries. However, there is little empirical evidence of these declines that can be used to put more recent population changes into historic context and set appropriate targets for species recovery.\nC_LIO_LIThis study is a collaboration between academics and conservation practitioners to develop molecular approaches capable of providing quantitative evidence of historic population changes and their drivers that can inform the assessment of conservation status and conservation management. We generated a genomic dataset for the Western barbastelle, Barbastella barbastellus, a globally Near Threatened and regionally Vulnerable bat species, including colonies from across the species British and Iberian ranges. We used a combination of landscape genetics and approximate Bayesian computation model-based inference of demographic history to identify both evidence of population size changes and possible drivers of these changes.\nC_LIO_LIWe found that levels of genetic diversity increased and inbreeding decreased with increasing broadleaf woodland cover around the colony location. Genetic connectivity was impeded by artificial lights and facilitated by the combination of rivers and broadleaf woodland cover.\nC_LIO_LIThe demographic history analysis showed that both the northern and southern British barbastelle populations have declined by 99% over the past 330-548 years. These declines may have been triggered by loss of large oak trees and native woodlands due to shipbuilding during the early colonial period.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis and applications. Genomic approaches can be applied to provide a better understanding of the conservation status of threatened species, within historic and contemporary context, and inform their conservation management.

The clonal selection theory posits that each mature B cell has a unique immunoglobulin receptor, generated through random gene recombination, and when stimulated to differentiate into an antibody-secreting cell has the capacity to produce only a single antibody specificity. Based on this classical, \"one cell one antibody\" dogma, analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data of antibody-secreting cells should reveal that each cell expresses only a single form of each of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. However, when using GRCh38 as the genome reference, many plasma cells appear to express multiple immunoglobulin isotypes.\n\nResultsWe show that this false mapping is caused by the inaccurate immunoglobulin sequences provided by GRCh38. The newly published human genome reference T2T-CHM13, due to its more accurate sequences, avoids this false mapping caveat. In addition, further reads mapped to GRCh38 with ambiguity also settle down perfectly.\n\nConclusionsThese studies reveal that the sequences of the immunoglobulin genes within T2T-CHM13 are more accurate than GRCh38. Thus T2T-CHM13 is the reference genome of choice for accurate mapping and identification of the human immunoglobulin genes.",

Thus, we generated adipocyte-specific Becn1/Yap1/Taz KO mice, which exhibit markedly restored phenotypes in adipose tissue, resulting in tumor regression compared to that in BaKO. Further, we observed dysregulation of the BECN1-YAP/TAZ axis in the adipose tissue of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Treatment with the YAP/TAZ inhibitor, verteporfin, suppressed tumor progression in BaKO and HFD-fed mice, highlighting its efficacy against mice with metabolic dysregulation.

    "abstract": "Cytosolic long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), among the most potent proinflammatory signals, is recognized by MDA5. MDA5 binds dsRNA cooperatively, forming helical filaments. ATP hydrolysis by MDA5 fulfills a proofreading function by promoting dissociation of shorter endogenous dsRNAs from MDA5 while allowing longer viral dsRNAs to remain bound leading to activation of interferon-{beta} responses. Here, we show that adjacent MDA5 subunits in MDA5-dsRNA filaments hydrolyze ATP cooperatively, inducing cooperative filament disassembly. This amplifies the RNA footprint expansion that accompanies each round of ATP hydrolysis and allows MDA5 to displace tightly bound proteins from dsRNA. Our electron microscopy and biochemical assays show that LGP2 binds to dsRNA at internal binding sites through noncooperative ATP hydrolysis. Unlike MDA5, LGP2 has low nucleic acid selectivity and can hydrolyze GTP and CTP as well as ATP. Binding of LGP2 to dsRNA promotes nucleation of MDA5 filament assembly resulting in shorter filaments. Molecular modeling of the MDA5-LGP2 interface suggests that MDA5 interacts with dsRNA stem-bound rather than end-bound LGP2. We conclude that NTPase-dependent binding of LGP2 to internal sites on dsRNA increases the number and signaling output of MDA5-dsRNA complexes. Our work identifies novel molecular mechanisms contributing the selectivity and sensitivity of cytosolic dsRNA sensing.\n\nKEY POINTSO_LICooperative ATP hydrolysis in MDA5 filaments confers selectivity for dsRNA and displaces other proteins from RNA\nC_LIO_LINoncooperative NTP hydrolysis by LGP2 induces binding to internal RNA sites with low selectivity\nC_LIO_LIRNA stem-bound LGP2 nucleates assembly of MDA5 signaling complexes on a broader set of RNA ligands\nC_LI",

When sparse sensor setups were used, the motion analysis was either not comprehensive or physical correctness was not considered. Furthermore, the relationship between sensor setup and the resulting accuracy of spatiotemporal, kinematic, or kinetic variables has not been investigated systematically. Therefore, we investigated the accuracy of biomechanical gait reconstructions from different sparse inertial sensor setups, in which the number of sensors is reduced by not placing sensors on all body segments of interest. We created biomechanical reconstructions by solving optimal control problems with a sagittal plane musculoskeletal model. The resulting simulations tracked raw accelerometer and gyroscope data while minimizing muscular effort. We applied this approach to six different sparse sensor setups to investigate the reconstruction quality of spatiotemporal, kinematic, and kinetic variables for each of these setups at three walking and three running speeds. We found that correlations between IMC and optical motion capture (OMC) were large for all sensor setups, but that those setups without a pelvis sensor led to a forward trunk lean that was too high, as well as unrealistic kinetics and kinematics. Spatiotemporal variable estimations generally also benefitted from a pelvis sensor, but not as much as the kinetic and kinematic estimations. We found that for setups including a pelvis sensor, there was no clear benefit for including additional sensors. While walking speed, step length, and joint kinematics generally benefited from using more sensors, the hip moment and knee moment did not. During running, the ankle moment and vertical ground reaction force were even estimated more accurately with smaller sensor setups. Therefore, we conclude that sagittal-plane reconstruction of walking and running kinetics and kinematics using sparse sensor setups can improve usability at the cost of only minor reductions in accuracy. When using a sparse sensor setup for gait reconstructions using optimal control, we advise to always include a pelvis sensor to achieve accurate results.\n\nAuthor summaryWe aim to analyse walking and running in an environment that is as normal as possible. To do so, we should use sensor setups that can be worn in any environment, and that are the least bothersome to the wearer, and that ensure their privacy. Inertial sensors are small sensors that measure accelerations and velocities during movements that can be used in any environment, while also they do not record privacy-sensitive information as video cameras would. To also ensure that they are the least bothersome, while still being accurate, we investigated the accuracy of walking and running variables of different sparse sensor setups, i.e., sensor setups that do not have sensors on each body part of interest. We compared these setups to a full sensor setup, with sensors on all body parts of interest. All sensor setups included sensors measuring the feet, because those can be attached to the shoes instead of on the body, as would be required for sensors measuring the thighs or shanks. We show that movement analyses can be as accurate as with the full sensor setup using only three sensors, two on the feet and one on the pelvis. We also found that any sensor setup with no pelvis sensor led to inaccurate analysis of the trunk.",

    "abstract": "Chitin is the second most abundant natural biopolymer; its crystalline structures have been extensively studied; however, the mechanism of chitins self-assembly is unknown. Here we applied all-atom molecular dynamics to study chitins self-assembly process at different temperatures. Strikingly, at 278 K, an amorphous aggregate was formed, whereas at 300 K single-sheet and at 323 K both single- and multi-sheet nanofibril regions were formed. The nanofibrils contain antiparallel, parallel or mixed orientation chains, with antiparallel being slightly preferred, recapitulating chitins polymorphism observed in nature. The inverse temperature dependence is consistent with the recent experiment. The analysis suggested that the multi-sheet nanofibrils are assembled by stacking the single nanofibril sheets, which are formed through two types of pathways in which hydrophobic collapse either precedes or is concomitant with increasing number of interchain hydrogen bonds and solvent expulsion. Furthermore, the antiparallel and parallel chains are mediated by different interchain hydrogen bonds. The analysis also suggested that the inverse temperature dependence may be attributed to the hydrophobic effect reminiscent of the low critical solution temperature phase behavior. The present study provides a rich, atomic-level view of chitins polymorphic self-assembly process, paving the way for the rational design of chitin-derived novel materials.",

However, conventional accessibility calculation tools, such as Raccess, are computationally expensive and require considerable computational time to perform transcriptome-scale analyses. In this study, we developed DeepRaccess, which predicts RNA accessibility based on deep learning methods. DeepRaccess was trained to take artificial RNA sequences as input and to predict the accessibility of these sequences as calculated by Raccess. Simulation and empirical dataset analyses showed that the accessibility predicted by DeepRaccess was highly correlated with the accessibility calculated by Raccess. In addition, we confirmed that DeepRaccess can predict protein abundance in E.coli with moderate accuracy from the sequences around the start codon. We also demonstrated that DeepRaccess achieved tens to hundreds of times software speed-up in a GPU environment.

    "abstract": "Vinculin is a mechanosensitive adapter protein that links the actin network to cell-extracellular matrix adhesions and cell-cell adhesions. It is perhaps the best characterized mechanoeffector, as it is recruited to sites of adhesion in response to force on the mechanotransducers talin and alpha-catenin. Here we examined the mechanical properties of vinculin to assess its potential role as a mechanotransducer. We find that at physiological loading rates, the structural domains of vinculin unfold at forces in the 5-15 pN range and rapidly refold when forces are reduced back to 1 pN. Thus, vinculin domains also have the potential to act as force dependent molecular switches, akin to those in talin and alpha-catenin. As with the force dependent switches in talin, the unfolding of these domains in vinculin introduces large extension changes in the vinculin cytoskeletal linkage up to 150 nm with 20-30 nm steps of unfolding. Modelling of the tension-dependent interactions of the unstructured vinculin linker region with a model protein containing two SH3 domains indicated that even unstructured protein regions can mediate force-dependent interactions with ligands, where the binding of a dual-SH3 model protein is predicted to be significantly suppressed by forces greater than 10 pN. Together, these findings suggest that vinculin has a complex mechanical response with force-dependent interaction sites, suggesting it also acts as a mechanotransducer, recruiting partners in response to force.",

    "abstract": "High dietary consumption of processed meat is associated with increased colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, but mechanistic links remain largely unknown. Tyramine is a biogenic amine found in processed food and a gut bacterial product from tyrosine. However, the impact of tyramine on gut health has not been studied. We found that tyramine induced necrosis and promoted cell proliferation and DNA damage in HCT116 cells. Ingestion of tyramine increased colonic tumor size, intestinal cell proliferation and inflammation (e.g., increased mRNA expression of IL-17A and a higher number of Ly6G+ neutrophils) in ApcMin/+ mice. Furthermore, tyramine-treated wild-type mice exhibited visible adenomas and significantly enhanced intestinal tissue DNA damage, together with altered gene pathways involved in epithelial barrier function. In addition, natural killer cell numbers were lower and polymorphonuclear-myeloid derived suppressor cells were higher in tumors from tyramine-treated ApcMin/+ mice, suggesting a suppressive anti-tumor immune response. Thus, tyramine not only increases CRC risk, but also facilitates tumor development. Modulating the levels of tyramine in food and monitoring high-risk individuals could aid in better prognosis and management of CRC.",

Widely distributed, they are also coded in the genomes of giant viruses infecting phytoplankton where their function is not settled. We examined the properties of three type 1 viral channelrhodopsins (VCR1s), and, unexpectedly, found that VCR1s accumulate exclusively intracellularly, and, upon illumination, induced calcium release from intracellular IP3-dependent stores. In vivo, this light-induced calcium release was sufficient to remote control muscle contraction and behavior in VCR1-expressing tadpoles. VCR1s are the first rhodopsins shown to natively confer light-induced Ca2+ release, suggesting an original mechanism for reshaping the response to light of virus-infected algae. The ability of VCR1s to photorelease calcium without altering plasma membrane electrical properties marks them as precursors for novel optogenetics tools, with potential applications in basic research and medicine.",

    "abstract": "The brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens) is the most destructive insect pest in rice. Through a stylet, BPH secrets a plethora of salivary proteins into rice phloem cells as a crucial step of infestation. However, how various salivary proteins function in rice cells to promote insect infestation is poorly understood. Among them, one of the salivary proteins is predicted to be a carbonic anhydrase (NlCA). The survival rate of the NlCA-RNA interference (RNAi) BPH insects was extremely low on rice, indicating a vital role of this salivary protein in BPH infestation. We generated NICA transgenic rice plants and found that NlCA expressed in rice plants could restore the ability of NlCA-RNAi BPH to survive on rice. Next, we produced rice plants expressing the ratiometric pH sensor pHusion and found that NlCA-RNAi BPH induced rapid intracellular acidification of rice cells during feeding. Further analysis revealed that both NlCA-RNAi BPH feeding and artificial of lowering intracellular pH activated plant defense responses, and that NICA-mediated intracellular pH stabilization is linked to diminished defense responses, including reduced callose deposition at the phloem sieve plates and suppressed defense gene expression. Given the importance of pH homeostasis across the kingdoms of life, discovery of NICA-mediated intracellular pH modulation uncovered a new dimension in the interaction between plants and piecing/sucking insect pests. The crucial role of NICA for BPH infestation of rice suggests that NICA is a promising target for chemical or trans-kingdom RNAi-based inactivation for BPH control strategies in plants.",

    "abstract": "Over 3 million people in the United States live with long-term disability as a result of a traumatic brain injury (TBI). The purpose of this study was to characterize and compare two different animal models of TBI (blunt head trauma and blast TBI) to determine common and divergent characteristics of these models. With recent literature reviews noting the prevalence of visual system injury in animal models of TBI, coupled with clinical estimates of 50-75% of all TBI cases, we decided to assess commonalities, if they existed, through visual system injury. Blast, repeat blast, and blunt injury were induced in adult male mice to observe and quantify visual deficits. Retinal ganglion cell loss and axonal degeneration in the optic tract, superior colliculus, and lateral geniculate nuclei were examined to trace injury outcomes throughout major vision-associated areas. Optokinetic response, immunohistochemistry, and western blots were analyzed. Where a single blunt injury produces significant visual deficits a single blast injury appears to have less severe visual consequences. Visual deficits after repeat blasts are similar to a single blast. Single blast injury induces contralateral damage to right optic chiasm and tract whereas bilateral injury follows a single blunt injury. Repeat blast injuries are required to see degeneration patterns in downstream regions similar to the damage seen in a single blunt injury. This finding is further supported by Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) staining in injured cohorts. Blunt injured groups present with staining 1.2 mm of the optic nerve, indicating axonal breakage closer to the optic chiasm. In blast groups, APP was identifiable in a bilateral pattern only in the geniculate nucleus. Evidence for unilateral neuronal degeneration in brain tissue with bilateral axonal ruptures are pivotal discoveries in this model differentiation. Analysis of the two injury models suggest there is a significant difference in the histological outcomes dependent on injury type, though visual system injury is likely present in more cases than are currently diagnosed clinically.",

    "abstract": "Across many brain areas, neural population activity appears to be constrained to a low-dimensional manifold within a neural state space of considerably higher dimension. Recent studies of the primary motor cortex (M1) suggest that the activity within the low-dimensional manifold, rather than the activity of individual neurons, underlies the computations required for planning and executing movements. To date, these studies have been limited to data obtained in constrained laboratory settings where monkeys executed repeated, stereotyped tasks. An open question is whether the observed low dimensionality of the neural manifolds is due to these constraints; the dimensionality of M1 activity during the execution of more natural and unconstrained movements, like walking and picking food, remains unknown. We have now found similarly low-dimensional manifolds associated with various unconstrained natural behaviors, with dimensionality only slightly higher than those associated with constrained laboratory behaviors. To quantify the extent to which these low-dimensional manifolds carry task-relevant information, we built task-specific linear decoders that predicted EMG activity from M1 manifold activity. In both settings, decoding performance based on activity within the estimated low-dimensional manifold was the same as decoding performance based on the activity of all recorded neurons. These results establish functional links between task-specific manifolds and motor behaviors, and highlight that both constrained and unconstrained behaviors are associated with low-dimensional M1 manifolds.",

There are four types of caseins -S1-casein, -S2-casein, {beta}-casein and {kappa}-casein in milk. The major function of the casein protein in milk is to chelate colloidal calcium phosphate and serves as a major source of amino acids, calcium and phosphate. In buffalo milk all four casein proteins (s1, s2, {beta} and {kappa}) are encoded by four closely linked autosomal genes (CSN1S1, CSN1S2, CSN2 and CSN3 respectively) that are present on chromosome 7. Bovine CSN2 ({beta}-casein) gene is 8.5 kb long and contains nine exons and CSN3 ({kappa}-casein) is [~] 13 kb long. The aim of the study was to characterize CSN2 and CSN3 genes, In-silico analysis of {beta}-casein and {kappa}-casein protein and evolutionary relationship with other species. Buffalo mammary gland tissue was collected from local slaughterhouse (New Delhi, India) and total RNA was isolated from Buffalo Mammary Epithelial Cells.

Physiochemical properties showed that both buffalo {beta}-casein (Bu_CSN2) and {kappa}-casein (Bu_CSN3) proteins are stable and hydrophobic in nature.The presence of high phosphorylated residues in both {beta}-casein and {kappa}-casein proteins residues suggested that they are involved in signal transduction processes, cell growth and metabolism. The N-glycosylation result showed that both proteins are less in foldable state. The presence of methylation and acetylation sites in both protein revealed that they are involved in different cellular process.

    "abstract": "During their maturation, ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are decorated by hundreds of chemical modifications that participate in proper folding of rRNA secondary structures and therefore in ribosomal function. Along with pseudouridine, methylation of the 2'-hydroxyl ribose moiety (Nm) is the most abundant modification of rRNAs. The majority of Nm modifications in eukaryotes are placed by Fibrillarin, a conserved methyltransferase belonging to a ribonucleoprotein complex guided by C/D box small nucleolar RNAs (C/D box snoRNAs). These modifications impact interactions between rRNAs, tRNAs and mRNAs, and some are known to fine tune translation rates and efficiency. In this study, we built the first comprehensive map of Nm sites in Drosophila melanogaster rRNAs using two complementary approaches (RiboMethSeq and Nanopore direct RNA sequencing) and identified their corresponding C/D box snoRNAs by whole-transcriptome sequencing. We de novo identified 61 Nm sites, from which 55 are supported by both sequencing methods, we validated the expression of 106 C/D box snoRNAs and we predicted new or alternative rRNA Nm targets for 31 of them. Comparison of methylation level upon different stresses show only slight but specific variations, indicating that this modification is relatively stable in D. melanogaster. This study paves the way to investigate the impact of snoRNA-mediated 2'-O-methylation on translation and proteostasis in a whole organism.",

We show that such mRNAs depend on the RNA topoisomerase activity for their proper expression and localization. Lack of the enzymatic activity of Top3{beta} stresses neurons, affecting the morphology of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in larvae and adult flies, aging, and the coordinated movement of older flies.

    "abstract": "In Morocco, cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania (L.) tropica is an important health problem. Despite its high incidence in the country, the genomic heterogeneity of these parasites is still incompletely understood. In this study, we sequenced the genomes of 14 Moroccan isolates of L. tropica collected from confirmed cases of CL to investigate their genomic heterogeneity. Comparative genomics analyses were conducted by applying the recently established Genome Instability Pipeline (GIP), which allowed us to conduct phylogenomic and PCA analyses, and to assess genomic variations at the levels of the karyotype, gene copy number, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The results identified a core group of 12 isolates that were genetically highly related but evolutionarily distant to the reference genome as judged by the presence of over 100,000 SNPs, 75% of which were shared inside this core group. In addition, we identified two highly divergent strains, M3015 and Ltr_16, that were phylogenetically distinct between each other as well as to the core group and the reference genome. Read-depth analysis revealed important karyotypic variations across all isolates and uncovered important differences in gene copy number between the isolates of the core group and the L. tropica reference genome, as well as between the core group and M3015. In conclusion, our NGS results suggest the presence of a local SNP signature that distinguishes Moroccan L. tropica from other endemic regions and from the reference genome. These results pave the way for future research with a larger number of strains that will allow to correlate diverse phenotypes (resistance to treatments, virulence) and origins (geography, host species, year of isolation) to defined genomic signals that may represent interesting biomarker candidates.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) relies on PCR amplification to retrieve information from vanishingly small amounts of starting material. To selectively enrich mRNA from abundant non-polyadenylated transcripts, poly(A) selection is a key step during library preparation. However, some transcripts, such as mitochondrial genes, can escape this elimination and overwhelm libraries. Often, these transcripts are removed in silico, but whether physical depletion improves detection of rare transcripts in single cells is unclear.\n\nResultsWe find that a single 16S ribosomal RNA is widely enriched in planarian scRNA-seq datasets, independent of the library preparation method. To deplete this transcript from scRNA-seq libraries, we design 30 single-guide RNAs spanning its length. To evaluate the effects of depletion, we perform a side-by-side comparison of the effects of eliminating the 16S transcript and find a substantial increase in the number of genes detected per cell, coupled with virtually complete loss of the 16S RNA. Moreover, we systematically determine that library complexity increases with a limited number of PCR cycles following CRISPR treatment. When compared to in silico depletion of 16S, physically removing it reduces dropout rates, retrieves more clusters, and reveals more differentially-expressed genes.\n\nConclusionsOur results show that abundant transcripts reduce the retrieval of informative transcripts in scRNA-seq and distort the analysis. Physical removal of these contaminants enables the detection of rare transcripts at lower sequencing depth, and also outperforms in silico depletion. Importantly, this method can be easily customized to deplete any abundant transcript from scRNA-seq libraries.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal connections provide the scaffolding for neuronal function. Revealing the connectivity of functionally identified individual neurons is necessary to understand how activity patterns emerge and support behavior. Yet, the brain-wide presynaptic wiring rules that lay the foundation for the functional selectivity of individual neurons remain largely unexplored. Cortical neurons, even in primary sensory cortex, are heterogeneous in their selectivity, not only to sensory stimuli but also to multiple aspects of behavior. Here, to investigate presynaptic connectivity rules underlying the selectivity of pyramidal neurons to behavioral state1-12 in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), we used two-photon calcium imaging, neuropharmacology, single-cell based monosynaptic input tracing, and optogenetics. We show that behavioral state-dependent neuronal activity patterns are stable over time. These are not determined by neuromodulatory inputs but are instead driven by glutamatergic inputs. Analysis of brain-wide presynaptic networks of individual neurons with distinct behavioral state-dependent activity profiles revealed characteristic patterns of anatomical input. While both behavioral state-related and unrelated neurons had a similar pattern of local inputs within S1, their long-range glutamatergic inputs differed. Individual cortical neurons, irrespective of their functional properties, received converging inputs from the main S1-projecting areas. Yet, neurons that tracked behavioral state received a smaller proportion of motor cortical inputs and a larger proportion of thalamic inputs. Optogenetic suppression of thalamic inputs reduced behavioral state-dependent activity in S1, but this activity was not externally driven. Our results revealed distinct long-range glutamatergic inputs as a substrate for preconfigured network dynamics associated with behavioral state.",

    "abstract": "The hypothalamus plays a vital role in coordinating essential neuroendocrine, autonomic, and somatomotor responses for survival and reproduction. While previous studies have explored population-level projections of hypothalamic neurons, the specific innervation patterns of individual hypothalamic axons remain unclear. To understand the organization of hypothalamic axon projections, we conducted a comprehensive reconstruction of single-cell projectomes from 7,180 mouse hypothalamic neurons expressing specific neuropeptides. Our analysis identified 31 distinct subtypes based on projectome-defined characteristics, with many exhibiting long-range axon collateral projections to multiple brain regions. Notably, these subtypes selectively targeted specific subdomains within downstream areas, either unilaterally or bilaterally. Furthermore, we observed that individual peptidergic neuronal types encompassed multiple projectome-defined subtypes, explaining their diverse functional roles. Additionally, by examining intra-hypothalamic axon projections, we uncovered six modular subnetworks characterized by enriched intramodular connections and distinct preferences for downstream targets. This modular organization of the intra-hypothalamic network likely contributes to the coordinated organization of hypothalamic outputs. In summary, our comprehensive projectome analysis reveals the organizational principles governing hypothalamic axon projections, providing a framework for understanding the neural circuit mechanisms underlying the diverse and coordinated functions of the hypothalamus.",

    "abstract": "SYNGAP1 is a Ras-GTPase activating protein highly enriched at excitatory synapses in the brain. De novo loss-of-function mutations in SYNGAP1 are a major cause of genetically defined neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). These mutations are highly penetrant and cause SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability (SRID), a NDD characterized by cognitive impairment, social deficits, early-onset seizures, and sleep disturbances (1-5). Studies in rodent neurons have shown that Syngap1 regulates developing excitatory synapse structure and function (6-11), and heterozygous Syngap1 knockout mice have deficits in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, and have seizures (9, 12-14). However, how specific SYNGAP1 mutations found in humans lead to disease has not been investigated in vivo. To explore this, we utilized the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate knock-in mouse models with two distinct known causal variants of SRID: one with a frameshift mutation leading to a premature stop codon, SYNGAP1; L813RfsX22, and a second with a single-nucleotide mutation in an intron that creates a cryptic splice acceptor site leading to premature stop codon, SYNGAP1; c.3583-9G>A. While reduction in Syngap1 mRNA varies from 30-50% depending on the specific mutation, both models show [~]50% reduction in Syngap1 protein, have deficits in synaptic plasticity, and recapitulate key features of SRID including hyperactivity and impaired working memory. These data suggest that half the amount of SYNGAP1 protein is key to the pathogenesis of SRID. These results provide a resource to study SRID and establish a framework for the development of therapeutic strategies for this disorder.\n\nSignificance StatementSYNGAP1 is a protein enriched at excitatory synapses in the brain that is an important regulator of synapse structure and function. SYNGAP1 mutations cause SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability (SRID), a neurodevelopmental disorder with cognitive impairment, social deficits, seizures, and sleep disturbances. To explore how SYNGAP1 mutations found in humans lead to disease, we generated the first knock-in mouse models with causal SRID variants: one with a frameshift mutation and a second with an intronic mutation that creates a cryptic splice acceptor site. Both models show decreased Syngap1 mRNA and Syngap1 protein and recapitulate key features of SRID including hyperactivity and impaired working memory. These results provide a resource to study SRID and establish a framework for the development of therapeutic strategies.\n\nHighlightsO_LITwo mouse models with SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability (SRID) mutations found in humans were generated: one with a frameshift mutation that results in a premature stop codon and the other with an intronic mutation resulting in a cryptic splice acceptor site and premature stop codon.\nC_LIO_LIBoth SRID mouse models show 35[~]50% reduction in mRNA and [~]50% reduction in Syngap1 protein.\nC_LIO_LIBoth SRID mouse models display deficits in synaptic plasticity and behavioral phenotypes found in people.\nC_LIO_LIRNA-seq confirmed cryptic splice acceptor activity in one SRID mouse model and revealed broad transcriptional changes also identified in Syngap1+/- mice.\nC_LIO_LINovel SRID mouse models generated here provide a resource and establish a framework for development of future therapeutic intervention.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveResearch into the role of neurotransmitters in regulating normal and pathologic brain functions has made significant progress. Yet, clinical trials that aim to improve therapeutic interventions do not take advantage of the in vivo changes in the neurochemistry that occur in real time during disease progression, drug interactions or response to pharmacological, cognitive, behavioral, and neuromodulation therapies. In this work, we used the WINCS Harmoni tool to study the real time in vivo changes in dopamine release in rodent brains for the micromagnetic neuromodulation therapy.\n\nApproachAlthough still in its infancy, micromagnetic stimulation (MS) using micro-meter sized coils or microcoils (coils) has shown incredible promise in spatially selective, galvanic contact free and highly focal neuromodulation. These coils are powered by a time-varying current which generates a magnetic field. As per Faradays Laws of Electromagnetic Induction, this magnetic field induces an electric field in a conducting medium (here, the brain tissues). We used a solenoidal-shaped coil to stimulate the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) of the rodent brain in vivo. The evoked in vivo dopamine releases in the striatum were tracked in real time by carbon fiber microelectrodes (CFM) using fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV).\n\nResultsOur experiments report that coils can successfully activate the MFB in rodent brains, triggering dopamine release in vivo. We further show that the successful release of dopamine upon micromagnetic stimulation is dependent on the orientation of the coil. Furthermore, varied intensities of MS can control the concentration of dopamine releases in the striatum.\n\nSignificanceThis work helps us better understand the brain and its conditions arising from a new therapeutic intervention, like MS, at the level of neurotransmitter release. Despite its early stage, this study potentially paves the path for MS to enter the clinical world as a precisely controlled and optimized neuromodulation therapy.",

    "abstract": "Memories for similar experiences can be either differentiated or integrated in the adult brain to support later memory retrieval and memory-based decision making. Yet how children represent related memories remains unknown. Here, children (7-10 years) and adults formed memories for separate yet overlapping events. We then measured how successfully remembered events were represented and reinstated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Both children and adults formed differentiated representations in hippocampus--such that related events were stored as less similar than unrelated events. Conversely, only adults formed integrated representations in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Furthermore, hippocampal differentiation among children and mPFC integration among adults tracked neocortical reinstatement of the specific features associated with the individual events. Together, these findings reveal that the same memory behaviors are supported by different underlying representations across development. Specifically, whereas differentiation underlies memory organization and retrieval in childhood, integration exhibits a protracted developmental trajectory.",

    "abstract": "Two-photon optogenetics has transformed our ability to probe the structure and function of neural circuits. However, achieving precise optogenetic control of neural ensemble activity has remained fundamentally constrained by the problem of off-target stimulation (OTS): the inadvertent activation of nearby non-target neurons due to imperfect confinement of light onto target neurons. Here we propose a novel computational approach to this problem called Bayesian target optimisation. Our approach uses nonparametric Bayesian inference to model neural responses to optogenetic stimulation, and then optimises the laser powers and optical target locations needed to achieve a desired activity pattern with minimal OTS. We validate our approach in simulations and using data from in vitro experiments, showing that Bayesian target optimisation substantially reduces OTS across all conditions we test. Together, these results establish our ability to overcome OTS, enabling optogenetic stimulation with significantly improved precision.",

    "abstract": "A central question in brain development lies in how individual neurons emerge and organize communities to acquire various functions. Voltage imaging provides unique approaches to addressing this by enabling simultaneous, non-invasive, in vivo recording of voltage dynamics from a population of cells. Recently, genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) facilitate cell-type specific imaging of voltage dynamics. However, it has not been applied to brain development. Here, we applied ArcLight, a GEVI utilizing voltage-sensitive domain, to zebrafish and established experimental approaches for analyzing voltage and morphology of neuron populations during development, focusing on the spinal cord and cerebellum. We initially demonstrated that Arclight was widely distributed in the neural tissues. With voltage imaging, we successfully visualized the coordinated, spontaneous activity of spinal cord neurons in their early stage of development at a high spatiotemporal resolution, at subcellular and population levels. Hyperpolarization and subthreshold signals were also detected. Finally, long-term voltage imaging during development revealed the process of changes in voltage dynamics in neuron populations, accompanied by axonal outgrowth. Voltage imaging could greatly contribute to our understanding of the functional organization of the nervous system during development.",

    "abstract": "We present evidence implicating the BAF (BRG1/BRM Associated Factor) chromatin remodeler in meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). By immunofluorescence (IF), the putative BAF DNA binding subunit, ARID1A (AT-rich Interaction Domain 1a), appeared enriched on the male sex chromosomes during diplonema of meiosis I. The germ cell-specific depletion of ARID1A resulted in a pachynema arrest and failure to repress sex-linked genes indicating a defective MSCI. Consistent with this defect, mutant sex chromosomes displayed an abnormal presence of elongating RNA polymerase II coupled with an overall increase in chromatin accessibility detectable by ATAC-seq. By investigating potential mechanisms underlying these anomalies, we identified a role for ARID1A in promoting the preferential enrichment of the histone variant, H3.3, on the sex chromosomes, a known hallmark of MSCI. Without ARID1A, the sex chromosomes appeared depleted of H3.3 at levels resembling autosomes. Higher resolution analyses by CUT&RUN revealed dramatic shifts in sex-linked H3.3 associations from discrete intergenic sites and broader gene-body domains to promoters in response to the loss of ARID1A. Several sex-linked sites displayed ectopic H3.3 occupancy that does not co-localize with DMC1 (DNA Meiotic Recombinase 1). This observation suggests a requirement for ARID1A in DMC1 localization to the asynapsed sex chromatids. We conclude that ARID1A-directed H3.3 localization influences sex chromosome gene regulation and DNA repair during meiosis I.",

The extent and nature of their actual contributions remains unclear, however, as previous studies did not investigate all GNAI proteins and included non-physiological approaches. Pertussis toxin can downregulate functionally redundant GNAI1, GNAI2, GNAI3 and GNAO proteins, but may also induce unrelated defects. Here we directly and systematically determined the role(s) of each individual GNAI protein in mouse auditory hair cells. GNAI2 and GNAI3 are similarly polarized at the hair cell apex with their binding partner GPSM2, whereas GNAI1 and GNAO are neither detected nor polarized. In Gnai3 mutants, GNAI2 progressively fails to fully occupy the subcellular compartments where GNAI3 is missing. In contrast, GNAI3 can fully compensate for the loss of GNAI2 and is essential for hair bundle morphogenesis and auditory function. Simultaneous inactivation of Gnai2 and Gnai3 recapitulates for the first time two distinct types of defects only observed so far with pertussis toxin: 1) a delay or failure of the basal body to migrate off-center in prospective hair cells, and 2) a reversal in the orientation of some hair cell types.

    "abstract": "The human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infects millions of people globally and is endemic to various resource-limited regions. Infections persist for life and are associated with increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and severe diseases including adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy-tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM-TSP). No HTLV-1-specific anti-retrovirals have been developed and it is unclear whether existing anti-retrovirals developed for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have efficacy against HTLV-1. To understand the structural basis for therapeutic binding, homology modelling and machine learning were used to develop a structural model of the HTLV-1 reverse transcriptase. With this, molecular docking experiments using a panel of FDA-approved inhibitors of viral reverse transcriptases to assess their capacity for binding, and in turn, inhibition. Importantly, nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) but not non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) were capable of binding the HTLV-1 reverse transcriptase, with similar affinity to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. By strengthening the rationale for clinical testing of therapies such as tenofovir alafenamide, zidovudine, lamivudine, and azvudine for treatment of HTLV-1, this study has demonstrated the power of in silico structural biology approaches in drug design and therapeutic testing.",

    "abstract": "Stem cells are extraordinary cells with a unique ability of self-renewal and differentiation into various cell types such as muscle, nerve, bone, and blood cells. Historically, they have found significant applications in the biotech and pharma sectors. To grow and maintain stem cells artificially, researchers use basal media formulations supplemented with nutrients and growth factors, with Fetal bovine serum (FBS) as the key component of the culture medium. However, to maintain this supply every year, millions of pregnant cows are slaughtered for preparing FBS. The process of harvesting FBS also raises concerns about contamination with pathogens, animal proteins that may interfere with cellular behavior and ethical considerations regarding animal welfare. To overcome these limitations, here we report ClearX9-Stem - an affordable, sustainable, effective, and ethical replacement for an FBS-enriched stem cell culture medium. A specialized ClearX9-Stem cell culture medium formulation was designed to grow chicken embryonic fibroblast (SL-29) in the absence of FBS. Based on the results obtained, ClearX9-Stem is undergoing further refinement to meet the growing academic and industrial demand for serum-free culture media formulations. In the future, there is a need to customize and optimize ClearX9-Stem for the scalable growth of cells in bioreactors.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIClearX9-Stem provides good nutritional support for the growth of chicken embryonic fibroblast cells.\nC_LIO_LIClearX9-Stem cell growth performance is comparable to the serum-enriched culture medium\nC_LIO_LIClearX9-Stem maintains a healthy morphological profile of cells during division\nC_LIO_LIClearX9-Stem generates a stress-free environment within cells\nC_LIO_LIClearX9-Stem does not require animal slaughter and reduces the environmental footprint\nC_LIO_LIClearX9-Stem has applications in the biotechnology, pharma, and cell-cultivated meat industries\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) is an evolutionarily expanded region in humans that is critical for numerous complex functions, many of which are largely hominoid-specific. While recent work shows that the presence or absence of specific sulci in anterior LPFC is associated with cognitive performance across age groups, it is unknown whether the presence of these structures relates to individual differences in the functional organization of LPFC. To fill this gap in knowledge, we leveraged multimodal neuroimaging data from 72 young adult humans aged 22-36 and show that dorsal and ventral components of the paraintermediate frontal sulcus (pimfs) present distinct morphological (surface area), architectural (thickness and myelination), and functional (resting-state connectivity networks) properties. We further contextualize the pimfs components within classic and modern cortical parcellations. Taken together, the dorsal and ventral pimfs components mark transitions in anatomy and function in LPFC, across metrics and parcellations. These results emphasize that the pimfs is a critical structure to consider when examining individual differences in the anatomical and functional organization of LPFC and highlight the importance of considering individual anatomy when investigating structural and functional features of the cortex.",

Here, we identify four patterns of live-virus neutralizing antibody responses: individuals with hybrid immunity (with confirmed prior infection); rare individuals with low responses (paucity of S1-binding antibodies); and surprisingly, two further groups with distinct serological repertoires. One group - broad responders - neutralize a range of SARS-CoV-2 variants, whereas the other - narrow responders - neutralize fewer, less divergent variants. This heterogeneity does not correlate with Ancestral S1-binding antibody, rather the quality of the serological response. Furthermore, IgDlowCD27-CD137+ B cells and CCR6+ CD4+ T cells are enriched in broad responders before dose 3. Notably, broad responders have significantly longer infection-free time after their third dose.

    "abstract": "Inflammation upon infectious lung injury is a double-edged sword: while tissue-infiltrating immune cells and cytokines are necessary to control infection, these same factors often aggravate injury. Full appreciation of both the sources and targets of inflammatory mediators is required to facilitate strategies to maintain antimicrobial effects while minimizing off-target epithelial and endothelial damage. Recognizing that the vasculature is centrally involved in tissue responses to injury and infection, we observed that pulmonary capillary endothelial cells (ECs) exhibit dramatic transcriptomic changes upon influenza injury punctuated by profound upregulation of Sparcl1. Endothelial deletion and overexpression of SPARCL1 implicated this secreted matricellular protein in driving key pathophysiologic symptoms of pneumonia, which we demonstrate result from its effects on macrophage polarization. SPARCL1 induces a shift to a pro-inflammatory \"M1-like\" phenotype (CD86+CD206-), thereby increasing associated cytokine levels. Mechanistically, SPARCL1 acts directly on macrophages in vitro to induce the pro-inflammatory phenotype via activation of TLR4, and TLR4 inhibition in vivo ameliorates inflammatory exacerbations caused by endothelial Sparcl1 overexpression. Finally, we confirmed significant elevation of SPARCL1 in COVID-19 lung ECs in comparison with those from healthy donors. Survival analysis demonstrated that patients with fatal COVID-19 had higher levels of circulating SPARCL1 protein compared to those who recovered, indicating the potential of SPARCL1 as a biomarker for prognosis of pneumonia and suggesting that personalized medicine approaches might be harnessed to block SPARCL1 and improve outcomes in high-expressing patients.",

    "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of mosquito-borne illness in the United States. There are currently no human vaccines or therapies available for WNV, and vector control is the primary strategy used to control WNV transmission. The WNV vector Culex tarsalis is also a competent host for the insect-specific virus (ISV) Eilat virus (EILV). ISVs such as EILV can interact with and cause superinfection exclusion (SIE) against human pathogenic viruses in their shared mosquito host, altering vector competence for these pathogenic viruses. The ability to cause SIE and their host restriction make ISVs a potentially safe tool to target mosquito-borne pathogenic viruses. In the present study, we tested whether EILV causes SIE against WNV in mosquito C6/36 cells and Culex tarsalis mosquitoes. The titers of both WNV strains--WN02-1956 and NY99--were suppressed by EILV in C6/36 cells as early as 48-72 h post superinfection at both multiplicity of infections (MOIs) tested in our study. The titers of WN02-1956 at both MOIs remained suppressed in C6/36 cells, whereas those of NY99 showed some recovery towards the final timepoint. The mechanism of SIE remains unknown, but EILV was found to interfere with NY99 attachment in C6/36 cells, potentially contributing to the suppression of NY99 titers. However, EILV had no effect on the attachment of WN02-1956 or internalization of either WNV strain under superinfection conditions. In Cx. tarsalis, EILV did not affect the infection rate of either WNV strain at either timepoint. However, in mosquitoes, EILV enhanced NY99 infection titers at 3 days post superinfection, but this effect disappeared at 7 days post superinfection. In contrast, WN02-1956 infection titers were suppressed by EILV at 7 days post-superinfection. The dissemination and transmission of both WNV strains were not affected by superinfection with EILV at either timepoint. Overall, EILV caused SIE against both WNV strains in C6/36 cells; however, in Cx. tarsalis, SIE caused by EILV was strain specific potentially owing to differences in the rate of depletion of shared resources by the individual WNV strains.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYWest Nile virus (WNV) is the main cause of mosquito-borne disease in the United States. In the absence of a human vaccine or WNV-specific antivirals, vector control is the key strategy to reduce WNV prevalence and transmission. The WNV mosquito vector, Culex tarsalis, is a competent host for the insect-specific virus Eilat virus (EILV). EILV and WNV potentially interact within the mosquito host, and EILV can be used as a safe tool to target WNV in mosquitoes. Here, we characterize the ability of EILV to cause superinfection exclusion (SIE) against two strains of WNV--WN02-1956 and NY99--in C6/36 cells and Cx. tarsalis mosquitoes. EILV suppressed both superinfecting WNV strains in C6/36 cells. However, in mosquitoes, EILV enhanced NY99 whole-body titers at 3 days post superinfection and suppressed WN02-1956 whole-body titers at 7 days post superinfection. Vector competence measures, including infection, dissemination, and transmission rates and transmission efficacy, as well as leg and saliva titers of both superinfecting WNV strains, were not affected by EILV at both timepoints. Our data show the importance of not only validating SIE in mosquito vectors but also testing multiple strains of viruses to determine the safety of this strategy as a control tool.",

    "abstract": "Signaling modules, such as MAPK pathways, are evolutionarily conserved drivers of cell differentiation and stress responses. In many fungal species including pathogens, MAPK pathways control filamentous growth, where cells differentiate into an elongated cell type. The convenient model budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes filamentous growth by the filamentous growth (fMAPK) pathway; however, the inducers of the pathway remain unclear, perhaps because pathway activity has been mainly studied in laboratory conditions. To address this knowledge gap, an ecological framework was employed, which uncovered new fMAPK pathway inducers, including pectin, a material found in plants, and the metabolic byproduct ethanol. We also show that induction by a known inducer of the pathway, the non-preferred carbon source galactose, required galactose metabolism and induced the pathway differently than glucose limitation or other non-preferred carbon sources. By exploring fMAPK pathway function in fruit, we found induction of the pathway led to visible digestion of fruit rind through a known target, PGU1, which encodes a pectolytic enzyme. Different stimuli revealed different modes of pathway signaling. For example, combinations of inducers (galactose and ethanol) stimulated the pathway to near maximal levels, which showed dispensability of several fMAPK pathway components (e.g. mucin sensor, PAK), but not others (e.g. adaptor, MAPKKK) and required the Ras2-PKA pathway. This included a difference between the transcription factor binding partners for the pathway, as Tec1p, but not Ste12p, was partly dispensable for fMAPK pathway activity. Thus, by exploring ecologically-relevant stimuli, new modes of MAPK pathway signaling were uncovered, perhaps revealing how a pathway can respond differently to specific environments.\n\nData Availability StatementAll data are in the manuscript and/or supporting information files.",

    "abstract": "Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is increasingly appreciated as both a consequence and precipitant of human disease. The outgrowth of the bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae is a common feature of dysbiosis, including the human pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae. Dietary interventions have proven efficacious in the resolution of dysbiosis, though the specific dietary components involved remain poorly defined. Based on a previous human diet study, we hypothesized that dietary nutrients serve as a key resource for the growth of bacteria found in dysbiosis. Through human sample testing, and ex-vivo, and in vivo modeling, we find that nitrogen is not a limiting resource for the growth of Enterobacteriaceae in the gut, contrary to previous studies. Instead, we identify dietary simple carbohydrates as critical in colonization of K. pneumoniae. We additionally find that dietary fiber is necessary for colonization resistance against K. pneumoniae, mediated by recovery of the commensal microbiota, and protecting the host against dissemination from the gut microbiota during colitis. Targeted dietary therapies based on these findings may offer a therapeutic strategy in susceptible patients with dysbiosis.",

Here, we conducted a longitudinal study to investigate gene expression patterns during acute SARS-CoV-2 illness. Cases included SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with extremely high viral loads early in their illness, individuals having low SARS-CoV-2 viral loads early in their infection, and individuals testing negative for SARS-CoV-2. We could identify widespread transcriptional host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection that were initially most strongly manifested in patients with extremely high initial viral loads, then attenuating within the patient over time as viral loads decreased. Genes correlated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load over time were similarly differentially expressed across independent datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung and upper airway cells, from both in vitro systems and patient samples. We also generated expression data on the human nose organoid model during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The human nose organoid-generated host transcriptional response captured many aspects of responses observed in the above patient samples, while suggesting the existence of distinct host responses to SARS-CoV-2 depending on the cellular context, involving both epithelial and cellular immune responses.

    "abstract": "Soil microbiomes are essential mediators of ecosystem services, and their resistance and resilience to anthropogenic disturbances can have profound effects on soil function. However, we know little about the determinants of soil microbiome resilience, especially in the context of long-term (press) disturbances. Here, we leveraged the seven-decade-old underground coal seam fire in Centralia, Pennsylvania, USA, to examine surface soil bacterial community resilience to long-term heat disturbance. As the fire slowly advances along coal seams, formerly fire-affected soils cool to ambient temperature enabling geographically localized comparisons of impacted soils across a gradient of fire intensities with recovered and reference soils. To assess soil bacterial microbiome response and resilience to the fire, we executed a seven-year field study, annually sampling sites selected to capture the range of disturbance intensities. We quantified the dynamics of the bacterial communities over time and across the fire-impact gradient and additionally accounted for population activation by combining 16S rRNA with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Over the years, the fire-affected sites cooled, and their microbiome structures recovered towards those of reference and recovered soils. However, the whole community demonstrated greater resilience than the active subset, suggesting that resilience could not solely be attributed to environmental selection and growth of active populations. We therefore suggest that regional dispersal, persistence, and revival from the local seed bank contribute to microbiome resilience. Importantly, this work indicates that DNA-based methods that do not account for activity may overestimate microbiome resilience, with implications for understanding microbiome functional recovery.\n\nSignificance statementThe climate crisis and anthropogenic pressure on the environment are fundamentally altering ecosystems and their functions. Many critical ecosystem functions, such as biogeochemical cycling, are facilitated by microbial communities. Understanding the responses and functional consequences of microbial communities to these long-term (press) disturbances requires consistent, interannual observations and a focus on the active microbial populations that contribute to the critical functions. This study leverages the seven-decade-old coal seam fire in Centralia, Pennsylvania, USA, to examine the resilience of soil bacterial microbiomes to an intense, long-term heat disturbance. It provides an interannual analysis of microbiome resilience along a fire-impact gradient and directly compares the dynamics of the active subset and the \"whole\" community (which also includes signals from dormant and deceased cells). This work provides evidence that immigration of inactive cells together with environmental selection can drive perceived microbiome recovery, and advances understanding of the mechanisms of environmental microbiome resilience.",

    "abstract": "Membraneless nuclear condensates are an emerging model of transcriptional regulation that involves spatially clustered enhancers and genes forming transcription condensates (TCs). We used a physical isolation approach and DNA/nascent RNA analysis to investigate the global organization of the genome in TCs. Comparative analysis of the two revealed the dynamic nature of the genome, with stable localization of promoters, dynamic recruitment of enhancers, and dynamic export of gene bodies out of TCs upon gene activation. Our findings also suggest that the RNA binding protein FUS undergoes decondensation upon nascent RNA binding, facilitating gene body export out of TCs.",

    "abstract": "RNA silencing pathways are complex, highly conserved, and perform widespread, critical regulatory roles. In C. elegans germlines, RNA surveillance occurs through a series of perinuclear germ granule compartments--P granules, Z granules, SIMR foci, and Mutator foci--multiple of which form via phase separation and exhibit liquid-like properties. The functions of individual proteins within germ granules are well-studied, but the spatial organization, physical interaction, and coordination of biomolecule exchange between compartments within germ granule \"nuage\" is less understood. Here we find that key proteins are sufficient for compartment separation, and that the boundary between compartments can be reestablished after perturbation. Using super-resolution microscopy, we discover a toroidal P granule morphology which encircles the other germ granule compartments in a consistent exterior-to-interior spatial organization. Combined with findings that nuclear pores primarily interact with P granules, this nuage compa rtment organization has broad implications for the trajectory of an RNA as it exits the nucleus and enters small RNA pathway compartments. Furthermore, we quantify the stoichiometric relationships between germ granule compartments and RNA to reveal discrete populations of nuage that differentially associate with RNAi-targeted transcripts, possibly suggesting functional differences between nuage configurations. Together, our work creates a more spatially and compositionally accurate model of C. elegans nuage which informs the conceptualization of RNA silencing through different germ granule compartments.",

    "abstract": "Autocatalytic networks likely played a central role in the shift from inanimate systems to protocells. Using an established hyperparasite framework, we model the emergence of antiparasite immunity using the Lotka Volterra equations. It builds on autocatalytic, increasingly complexed RNA networks reflecting the historical exposure to ubiquitous molecular parasites. First, upon parasite encounter, specific catalysts providing parasite resistance appear in primordial autocatalytic cycles, supplanted by promiscuous, efficiently self-replicating, but parasite sensitive ribozymes. This is supported by catalyst tradeoff analysis. Substrate promiscuity confers high catalytic activity, but entails parasite exposure, higher substrate specificity implies relatively lower activity, yet it offers parasite resistance. Second, sustained parasite influx generates hyperparasite cycles, reactivating the original, parasite-specific catalyst-subunit that now once more provides parasite resistance, in a homeostatically stabilized habitat, empirically consistent with phage satellites and defective RNA viruses induced across a range of parasite loads. Third, under continuous exposure to progressively elaborate parasite populations, hyperparasites degenerate and embody antiparasite immunity. Again, the observed triggering of antiviral immunity by phage satellite encoded antiphage systems and defective RNA virus genomes are in agreement with this model. As such, it offers an attractive and unifying theory for the spontaneous birth of immunity in early life.",

This is novel mercury-complex having cell culture study. The mercury complex has been synthesized and characterized by CHNS analyzer, FTIR, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and DNA damage. Surface morphology of prepared mercury-complex was studied by microscopy imaging/Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The main goal of this contribution is to address the damaging effects of mercury-complex in cell cultures through fluorescence imaging and identifying cell Live/Death quantitative results. These live/death color intensities are red or green in presence to the mercury-complex. For this purpose, we measured the concentration dependence of mercury-complex on the rate of death in cells which may be useful for the cell culture and DNA study. The mercury-complex derived from benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid has the ability to break the polynucleotide structure of DNA to mono nucleotides resulting irreparable DNA damage. The experimental results of fluorescence microscopy and live/dead cell assay on cell viability reflected the potent cellular toxicity of mercury-complex causes cell culture study.

Here, we introduce MRT- ModSeq for rapid, simultaneous detection of multiple RNA modifications using MarathonRT. MRT-ModSeq employs distinct divalent cofactors to generate 2-D mutational profiles that are highly dependent on nucleotide identity and modification type. As a proof of concept, we use the MRT fingerprints of well-studied rRNAs to implement a general workflow for detecting RNA modifications. MRT-ModSeq rapidly detects positions of diverse modifications across a RNA transcript, enabling assignment of m1acp3Y, m1A, m3U, m7G and 2-OMe locations through mutation-rate filtering and machine learning. m1A sites in sparsely modified targets, such as MALAT1 and PRUNE1 could also be detected.

    "abstract": "Aerobic denitrifying bacteria have the potential for engineering applications due to the efficient nitrate removal capacity from wastewater. In this study, a novel aerobic denitrifying strain was isolated and identified as Achromobacter xylosoxidans GR7397 from the activated sludge of a wastewater treatment plant, which possessed efficient nitrate removal capacity. Moreover, the denitrification capacity and properties of the strain were investigated in the presence of nitrate as the only nitrogen source. Five denitrification reductases encoding genes were harbored by strain GR7397 determined by electrophoretic analysis of PCR amplification products, consisting of periplasmic nitrate reductase (NAP), nitrate reductase (NAR), nitrite reductase (NIR), nitrous oxide reductase (NOS), and nitric oxide reductase (NOR), demonstrating that the strain has a complete denitrification metabolic pathway. The optimum denitrifying condition of strain GR7397 included sodium acetate adopted as the electron donor, COD/TN ratio at 4, pH at 8, temperature at 30{degrees}C, under which condition, the nitrate removal rate reached 14.86 mg {middle dot} L-1 {middle dot} h-1 that the [Formula] concentration decreased from 93.90 mg/L to 4.73 mg/L within 6 h with no accumulation of nitrite. In addition, the bioaugmentation performance of strain GR7397 to enhance nitrate removal was evaluated to be effective and stabilized in a sequential batch reactor (SBR). The removal rate of [Formula] was the highest during each cycle with a range of 15.48-28.56 mg{middle dot}L-1{middle dot}h-1 in the SBR with inoculating 30% of the strain concentrate. The current research demonstrated that strain GR7397 has significant potential for application in enhancing nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment.",

    "abstract": "The revolution brought about by AlphaFold2 and the performance of AlphaFold2-Multimer open promising perspectives to unravel the complexity of protein-protein interaction networks. Nevertheless, the analysis of interaction networks obtained from proteomics experiments does not systematically provide the delimitations of the interaction regions. This is of particular concern in the case of interactions mediated by intrinsically disordered regions, in which the interaction site is generally small. Using a dataset of protein-peptide complexes involving intrinsically disordered protein regions that are non-redundant with the structures used in AlphaFold2 training, we show that when using the full sequences of the proteins involved in the interaction networks, AlphaFold2-Multimer only achieves 40% success rate in identifying the correct site and structure of the interface. By delineating the interaction region into fragments of decreasing size and combining different strategies for integrating evolutionary information, we managed to raise this success rate up to 90%. Beyond the correct identification of the interaction site, our study also explores specificity issues. We show the advantages and limitations of using the AlphaFold2 confidence score to discriminate between alternative binding partners, a task that can be particularly challenging in the case of small interaction motifs.",

We have previously shown that activation of TRPV1 by different ligands result in single-channel openings with different conductance, suggesting that the selectivity filter is highly dynamic. TRPV1 is weakly voltage-dependent, here we sought to explore whether the permeation of different monovalent ions could influence the voltage-dependence of this ion channel. By using single-channel recordings, we show that TRPV1 channels undergo rapid transitions to closed states that are directly connected to the open state, which may result from structural fluctuations of their selectivity filters. Moreover, we demonstrate that the rates of these transitions are strongly influenced by the permeant ion, suggesting that ion permeation regulates the voltage dependence of these channels.",

Nanoparticle tracking analysis, dynamic light scattering, and cryo-electron tomography showed the presence of a heterogeneous population of EVs isolated from the apoplastic wash of sorghum leaves. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that EVs had a median size of 110 nm and distinct populations of vesicles with single or multiple lipid bilayers and low or high amounts of contents. The heterogeneity was further supported by data showing that only a subset of EVs that were stained with a membrane dye, Potomac Gold, were also stained with the membrane-permeant esterase-dependent dye, Calcein-acetoxymethyl ester. Proteomic analysis identified 437 proteins that were enriched in multiple EV isolations, with the majority of these also being found in the EV proteome of Arabidopsis. These data suggest a partial conservation of EV contents and function between the monocot, sorghum, and a distantly related eudicot, Arabidopsis.",

    "abstract": "Translational control in pathogenic bacteria is fundamental to gene expression and affects virulence and other infection phenotypes. We used an enhanced ribosome profiling protocol coupled with parallel transcriptomics to capture accurately the global translatome of two evolutionarily distant pathogenic bacteria - the Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella and the Gram positive bacterium Listeria We find that the two bacteria use different mechanisms to translationally regulate protein synthesis. In Salmonella, in addition to the expected correlation between translational efficiency and cis-regulatory features such as Shine-Dalgarno (SD) strength and RNA secondary structure around the initiation codon, our data reveal an effect of the 2nd and 3rd codons, where the presence of tandem lysine codons (AAA-AAA) enhances translation in both Salmonella and E. coli. Strikingly, none of these features are seen in efficiently translated Listeria transcripts. Instead, approximately 15% of efficiently translated Listeria genes exhibit 70S footprints seven nt upstream of the authentic start codon, suggesting that these genes may be subject to a novel translational initiation mechanism. Our results show that SD strength is not a direct hallmark of translational efficiency in all bacteria. Instead, Listeria has evolved additional mechanisms to control gene expression level that are distinct from those utilised by Salmonella and E. coli.\n\n For the purpose of open access, the author has applied a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence to any Author Accepted Manuscript version arising",

    "abstract": "Parabasalid protists recently emerged as keystone members of the mammalian microbiota with important effects on their hosts health. However, the prevalence and diversity of parabasalids in wild reptiles and the consequences of captivity and other environmental factors on these symbiotic protists are unknown. Reptiles are ectothermic, and their microbiomes are subject to temperature fluctuations, such as those driven by climate change. Thus, conservation efforts for threatened reptile species may benefit from understanding how shifts in temperature and captive breeding influence the microbiota, including parabasalids, to impact host fitness and disease susceptibility. Here, we surveyed intestinal parabasalids in a cohort of wild reptiles across three continents and compared these to captive animals. Reptiles harbor surprisingly few species of parabasalids compared to mammals, but these protists exhibited a flexible host-range, suggesting specific adaptations to reptilian social structures and microbiota transmission. Furthermore, reptile-associated parabasalids are adapted to wide temperature ranges, although colder temperatures significantly altered the protist transcriptomes, with increased expression of genes associated with detrimental interactions with the host. Our findings establish that parabasalids are widely distributed in the microbiota of wild and captive reptiles and highlight how these protists respond to temperature swings encountered in their ectothermic hosts.",

    "abstract": "Scaffold proteins help mediate interactions between protein partners, often to optimize intracellular signaling. Herein, we use comparative, biochemical, biophysical, molecular, and cellular approaches to investigate how the scaffold protein NEMO contributes to signaling in the NF-{kappa}B pathway. Comparison of NEMO and the related protein optineurin from a variety of evolutionarily distant organisms revealed that a central region of NEMO, called the Intervening Domain (IVD), is conserved between NEMO and optineurin. Previous studies have shown that this central core region of the IVD is required for cytokine-induced activation of I{kappa}B kinase (IKK). We show that the analogous region of optineurin can functionally replace the core region of the NEMO IVD. We also show that an intact IVD is required for the formation of disulfide-bonded dimers of NEMO. Moreover, inactivating mutations in this core region abrogate the ability of NEMO to form ubiquitin-induced liquid-liquid phase separation droplets in vitro and signal-induced puncta in vivo. Thermal and chemical denaturation studies of truncated NEMO variants indicate that the IVD, while not intrinsically destabilizing, can reduce the stability of surrounding regions of NEMO, due to the conflicting structural demands imparted on this region by flanking upstream and downstream domains. This conformational strain in the IVD mediates allosteric communication between N- and C-terminal regions of NEMO. Overall, these results support a model in which the IVD of NEMO participates in signal-induced activation of the IKK/NF-{kappa}B pathway by acting as a mediator of conformational changes in NEMO.",

    "abstract": "Proper maintenance of epigenetic information after replication is dependent on the rapid assembly and maturation of chromatin. Chromatin Assembly Complex 1 (CAF-1) is a conserved histone chaperone that deposits (H3-H4)2 tetramers as part of the replication-dependent chromatin assembly process. Loss of CAF-1 leads to a delay in chromatin maturation, albeit with minimal impact on steady-state chromatin structure. However, the mechanisms by which CAF-1 mediates the deposition of (H3-H4)2 tetramers and the phenotypic consequences of CAF-1-associated assembly defects are not well understood. We used nascent chromatin occupancy profiling to track the spatiotemporal kinetics of chromatin maturation in both wild-type (WT) and CAF-1 mutant yeast cells. Our results show that loss of CAF-1 leads to a heterogeneous rate of nucleosome assembly, with some nucleosomes maturing at near WT kinetics and others exhibiting significantly slower maturation kinetics. The slow-to-mature nucleosomes are enriched in intergenic and poorly transcribed regions, suggesting that transcription-dependent assembly mechanisms can reset the slow-to-mature nucleosomes following replication. Nucleosomes with slow maturation kinetics are also associated with poly(dA:dT) sequences, which implies that CAF-1 deposits histones in a manner that counteracts resistance from the inflexible DNA sequence, promoting the formation of histone octamers as well as ordered nucleosome arrays. In addition, we demonstrate that the delay in chromatin maturation is accompanied by a transient and S-phase specific loss of gene silencing and transcriptional regulation, revealing that the DNA replication program can directly shape the chromatin landscape and modulate gene expression through the process of chromatin maturation.",

    "abstract": "Predicting protein-protein interactions (PPI) is a challenging problem of central importance in fundamental biology. With the increasing number of available PPI prediction methods and databases, an effective evaluation model would be extremely valuable. Here we introduce ZIPPI (Z-score for Information about Protein-Protein Interfaces), which evaluates structural models of a complex based on sequence co-evolution and conservation involving residues that are in contact in the interface. The interface Z-score (ZIPPI score) is calculated by comparing metrics for interface contacts to metrics obtained from randomly chosen surface residues. Since contacting residues are defined by the structural model, this obviates the need of accounting for indirect interactions with methods such as Direct Coupling Analysis. Although ZIPPI relies on species-paired multiple sequence alignments, its focus on contacting interfacial residues and the avoidance of direct coupling methods makes it computationally efficient. The performance of ZIPPI is evaluated through applications to experimentally determined complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and to decoys from the Critical Assessment of PRedicted Interactions (CAPRI) experiment. We demonstrate how ZIPPI can be implemented on a genome-wide scale by calculating scores for millions of structural models of protein-protein interactions in the E. coli interactome as predicted by PrePPI. Many PrePPI predictions filtered by ZIPPI score are novel. In all, this proteome-scale method shows promising feasibility for applications to the full human protein interactome, which is not yet accessible to deep learning methods.",

    "abstract": "Post-transcriptional RNA modifications (PTxMs) present in small RNA species, specifically circulating extracellular RNAs, were recently identified as clinically relevant readouts, often more indicative of disease severity than the classical \"up and down\" changes in their copy number alone. While identification of PTxMs requires multiple and complex sample preparation steps, microgram-range amounts of RNA, followed by expensive and protracted bioinformatics analyses, the clinically relevant information is usually a yes/no for a particular genetic variant(s), and an up/down answer for relevant biomarkers. We have previously shown that molecular beacons (MBs) can identify specific nucleic acid sequences with picomolar sensitivity and single nucleotide specificity by exploiting the target-dependent change in their electrophoretic mobility profile. We now present a method for direct identification of miRNAs and isomiRs in cells and extracellular vesicles using gel electrophoresis, without the need for RNA isolation and purification. The detection is based on discreet changes in the hydrodynamic surface profile, the overall size, charge and charge distribution of the MB-target hybrid. Furthermore, using an RNA tertiary structure prediction algorithm (iFoldRNA) and a custom molecular dynamics simulation (DMD), we designed modified MBs specific for m6A-modified nucleotides in target RNA sequences. The sample preparation method coupled to the software package affords the design of specific MBs and sensitive, multiplex-type detection of targets in a wide variety of biofluids and cells, in a simple mix and read approach.",

    "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections account for nearly all cervical cancer cases, which is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. High-risk variants, including HPV16, drive tumorigenesis in part by promoting the degradation of the tumor suppressor p53. This degradation is mediated by the HPV early protein 6 (E6), which recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP and redirects its activity towards ubiquitinating p53. Targeting the protein interaction interface between HPV E6 and E6AP is a promising modality to mitigate HPV-mediated degradation of p53. In this study, we designed a covalent peptide inhibitor, termed reactide, that mimics the E6AP LXXLL binding motif by selectively targeting cysteine 58 in HPV16 E6 with quantitative conversion. This reactide provides a starting point in the development of covalent peptidomimetic inhibitors for intervention against HPV-driven cancers.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that several Homo sapiens populations experienced admixture with extinct human species during their evolutionary history. Sometimes, such a gene flow could have played a role in modulating their capability to cope with a variety of selective pressures, thus resulting in archaic adaptive introgression events. A paradigmatic example of this evolutionary mechanism is offered by the EPAS1 gene, whose most frequent haplotype in Himalayan highlanders was proved to reduce their susceptibility to chronic mountain sickness and to be introduced in the gene pool of their ancestors by admixture with Denisovans. In this study, we aimed at further expanding the investigation of the impact of archaic introgression on more complex adaptive responses to hypobaric hypoxia evolved by populations of Tibetan and Sherpa ancestry, which have been plausibly mediated by soft selective sweeps and/or polygenic adaptations rather than by hard selective sweeps. For this purpose, we used a combination of composite-likelihood and gene network-based methods to detect adaptive loci in introgressed chromosomal segments from Tibetan whole genome sequence data and to shortlist those enriched for Denisovan-like derived alleles that participate to the same functional pathways. According to this approach, we identified multiple genes putatively involved in archaic introgression events and that, especially as regards EP300 and NOS2, have plausibly contributed to shape the adaptive modulation of angiogenesis and nitric oxide induction in high-altitude Himalayan peoples. These findings provided unprecedented evidence about the complexity of the adaptive phenotype evolved by these human groups to cope with challenges imposed by hypobaric hypoxia, offering new insights into the tangled interplay of genetic determinants that mediates the physiological adjustments crucial for human adaptation to the high-altitude environment.",

    "abstract": "Purkinje cell (PC) synapses onto cerebellar nuclei (CbN) neurons convey signals from the cerebellar cortex to the rest of the brain. PCs are inhibitory neurons that spontaneously fire at high rates, and many uniform sized PC inputs are thought to converge onto each CbN neuron to suppress or eliminate firing. Leading theories maintain that PCs encode information using either a rate code, or by synchrony and precise timing. Individual PCs are thought to have limited influence on CbN neuron firing. Here, we find that single PC to CbN synapses are highly variable in size, and using dynamic clamp and modelling we reveal that this has important implications for PC-CbN transmission. Individual PC inputs regulate both the rate and timing of CbN firing. Large PC inputs strongly influence CbN firing rates and transiently eliminate CbN firing for several milliseconds. Remarkably, the refractory period of PCs leads to a brief elevation of CbN firing prior to suppression. Thus, PC-CbN synapses are suited to concurrently convey rate codes, and generate precisely-timed responses in CbN neurons. Variable input sizes also elevate the baseline firing rates of CbN neurons by increasing the variability of the inhibitory conductance. Although this reduces the relative influence of PC synchrony on the firing rate of CbN neurons, synchrony can still have important consequences, because synchronizing even two large inputs can significantly increase CbN neuron firing. These findings may be generalized to other brain regions with highly variable sized synapses.",

Here we manipulate social conditions to study the alternative reproductive tactics displayed by genetically identical, age-matched laboratory mice competing for territories under ecologically realistic social environmental conditions. We introduced adult males and females of the laboratory mouse strain (C57BL/6J) into a large, outdoor field enclosure containing defendable resource zones under one of two social conditions. We first created a low-density social environment, such that the number of available territories exceeded the number of males. After males established stable territories, we introduced a pulse of intruder males and observed the resulting defensive and invasive tactics employed. In response to this change in social environment, males with large territories invested more in patrolling but were less effective at excluding intruder males as compared to males with small territories. Intruding males failed to establish territories and displayed an alternative tactic featuring greater exploration as compared to genetically identical territorial males. Alternative tactics did not lead to equal reproductive success--males that acquired territories experienced greater survival and had greater access to females.",

    "abstract": "1Genomic evidence supports an important role for selection in shaping patterns of introgression along the genome, but frameworks for understanding the dynamics underlying these patterns within hybrid populations have been lacking. Here, we develop methods based on the Wavelet Transform to understand the spatial genomic scale of local ancestry variation and its association with recombination rates. We present theory and use simulations to show how wavelet-based decompositions of ancestry variance along the genome and the correlation between ancestry and recombination reflect the joint effects of recombination, genetic drift, and genome-wide selection against introgressed alleles. Due to the clock-like effect of recombination in hybrids breaking up parental haplotypes, drift and selection produce predictable patterns of local ancestry variation at varying spatial genomic scales through time. Using wavelet approaches to identify the genomic scale of variance in ancestry and its correlates, we show that these methods can detect temporally localized effects of drift and selection. We apply these methods to previously published datasets from hybrid populations of swordtail fish (Xiphophorus) and baboons (Papio), and to inferred Neanderthal introgression in modern humans. Across systems, we find that upwards of 20% of the variation in local ancestry at the broadest genomic scales can be attributed to systematic selection against introgressed alleles, consistent with strong selection acting on early-generation hybrids. We also see signals of selection at fine genomic scales and much longer time scales. However, we show that our ability to confidently infer selection at fine scales is likely limited by inherent biases in current methods for estimating local ancestry from genomic similarity. Wavelet approaches will become widely applicable as genomic data from systems with introgression become increasingly available, and can help shed light on generalities of the genomic consequences of interspecific hybridization.",
