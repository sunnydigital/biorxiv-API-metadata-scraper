    "abstract": "Adipocyte lipid droplets (LDs) play a crucial role in systemic lipid metabolism by storing and releasing lipids to meet the organisms energy needs. Hormonal signals such as catecholamines and insulin act on adipocyte LDs, and impaired responsiveness to these signals can lead to uncontrolled lipolysis, lipotoxicity, and a higher risk of metabolic diseases. To investigate the mechanisms that control LD function in human adipocytes, we employed techniques to obtain mesenchymal progenitor cells on a large scale and applied proximity labeling mediated by enhanced ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2) to identify the interactome of PLIN1 in differentiated adipocytes. We identified 70 proteins that interact specifically with PLIN1, including PNPLA2 and LIPE, which are the primary effectors of regulated triglyceride hydrolysis, and four members of the 14-3-3 protein family (YWHAB, YWHAE, YWHAZ, and YWHAG), which are known to regulate diverse signaling pathways. Functional studies showed that YWHAB is required for maximum cAMP-stimulated lipolysis and helps to mitigate the anti-lipolytic effects of insulin. These findings reveal new regulatory mechanisms that control lipolysis in human metabolism.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTLipid droplets are ubiquitous cytoplasmic organelles that store metabolic energy and play a key role in cellular lipid metabolism (1). Adipocyte LDs play an additional, crucial role, as they supply the energy needs of the whole body through hormonally regulated triglyceride synthesis, storage, and release. The mechanisms by which adipocyte lipid droplets release lipids for systemic use has been mostly studied in mouse models and cell lines. To understand how lipid mobilization is controlled in human adipocytes, we used proximity labeling to identify proteins that interact with PLIN1, a major component of the lipid droplet, in adipocytes generated from primary human progenitor cells. Our study catalogues the interactome of human PLIN1 and identifies previously unrecognized potential mechanism for control of human adipocyte lipolysis through 14-3-3 proteins.",

    "abstract": "Arrestins bind active phosphorylated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Among the four mammalian subtypes, only arrestin-3 facilitates the activation of JNK3 in cells. In available structures, Lys-295 in the lariat loop of arrestin-3 and its homologue Lys-294 in arrestin-2 directly interact with the activator-attached phosphates. We compared the role of arrestin-3 conformational equilibrium and of Lys-295 in GPCR binding and JNK3 activation. Several mutants with enhanced ability to bind GPCRs showed much lower activity towards JNK3, whereas a mutant that does not bind GPCRs was more active. Subcellular distribution of mutants did not correlate with GPCR recruitment or JNK3 activation. Charge neutralization and reversal mutations of Lys-295 differentially affected receptor binding on different backgrounds, but had virtually no effect on JNK3 activation. Thus, GPCR binding and arrestin-3-assisted JNK3 activation have distinct structural requirements, suggesting that facilitation of JNK3 activation is the function of arrestin-3 that is not bound to a GPCR.",

    "abstract": "Kinesin-5 motor proteins play essential roles during mitosis in most organisms. Their tetrameric structure and plus-end-directed motility allow them to bind to and move along antiparallel microtubules, thereby pushing spindle poles apart to assemble a bipolar spindle. Recent work has shown that the C-terminal tail is particularly important to kinesin-5 function: the tail affects motor domain structure, ATP hydrolysis, motility, clustering, and sliding force measured for purified motors, as well as motility, clustering, and spindle assembly in cells. Because previous work has focused on presence or absence of the entire tail, the functionally important regions of the tail remain to be identified. We have therefore characterized a series of kinesin-5/Cut7 tail truncation alleles in fission yeast. Partial truncation causes mitotic defects and temperature-sensitive growth, while further truncation that removes the conserved BimC motif is lethal. We compared the sliding force generated by cut7 mutants using a kinesin-14 mutant background in which some microtubules detach from the spindle poles and are pushed into the nuclear envelope. These Cut7-driven protrusions decreased as more of the tail was truncated, and the most severe truncations produced no observable protrusions. Our observations suggest that the C-terminal tail of Cut7p contributes to both sliding force and midzone localization. In the context of sequential tail truncation, the BimC motif and adjacent C-terminal amino acids are particularly important for sliding force. In addition, moderate tail truncation increases midzone localization, but further truncation of residues N-terminal to the BimC motif decreases midzone localization.",

    "abstract": "Fungi can affect aquatic ecosystems through syntrophic and parasitic interactions with other organisms and organic matter. In pelagic systems, fungal parasites on phytoplankton can control trophic interactions and food-web dynamics, e.g., zooplankton grazing on fungal parasite zoospores creates an alternative energy pathway (termed \"mycoloop\") from otherwise inedible phytoplankton species. We aim to investigate how the mycoloop influences community dynamics in aquatic food-webs combining experimental and modelling approaches. We assembled an experimental system consisting of an inedible (host) phytoplankton species and its parasitic chytrid, an edible (non-host) phytoplankton species, and a zooplankton grazer. Chytrids parasitizing increased edible phytoplankton abundance, while zooplankton grazing decreased edible phytoplankton abundance. In the presence of zooplankton and chytrids, competition effects between edible and inedible phytoplankton species depended on nutrient levels. At high nutrient levels, competition was balanced by an indirect positive chytrid effect and negative zooplankton grazing effects on edible phytoplankton. In contrast, at low nutrient levels, we found chytrid had a negative impact on edible phytoplankton synergistically with zooplankton. Mathematical investigations suggest that the synergistic effect can be caused by the mycoloop. This indicates that the mycoloop substantially affects predator-prey interactions and phytoplankton competition with yet unknown ecological consequences.",

    "abstract": "Standard Genetic Code (SGC) evolution is quantitatively modeled in computed  worlds containing up to 2000 independent coding  environments. Environments can host multiple codes that may fuse or divide, with division yielding identical descendants. Code division may be selected - sophisticated gene products could be required for orderly separation. Several unforeseen results emerge: more rapid evolution requires unselective code division, rather than its selective form. Combining selective and unselective code division, with/without code fusion, with/without independent environmental coding tables and with/without wobble defines 25 = 32 possible pathways for SGC evolution. These 32 possible histories are compared, particularly, for speed and accuracy. Pathways differ greatly; for example, {approx} 300-fold different in time to evolve SGC-like codes. Eight of 32 pathways, employing code division, are quickest. Four of these eight, that combine fusion and division, also unite speed and accuracy. The two precise, swiftest paths, thus the most likely routes to the SGC, are similar, differing only in fusion with independent environmental codes. Code division instead of fusion with unrelated codes implies that independent codes can be dispensable. Instead, a single ancestral code that divides and fuses can initiate fully encoded peptide biosynthesis. Division and fusion create a  crescendo of competent coding, facilitating search for the SGC, and also assist advent of otherwise disfavored wobble coding. Code fusion readily unites multiple codon assignment mechanisms. But via code division and fusion, the SGC is shown to emerge from a single primary origin, via familiar cellular events.",

Here, we analyzed groups of closely related Bacillus phages that showed differential sensitivity to bacterial defense systems, and identified multiple families of anti-defense proteins that inhibit the Gabija, Thoeris, and Hachiman systems. We show that these proteins efficiently cancel the defensive activity when co-expressed with the respective defense system or introduced into phage genomes. Homologs of these anti-defense proteins are found in hundreds of phages that infect taxonomically diverse bacterial species. We show that an anti-Gabija protein, denoted Gad1, blocks the ability of the Gabija defense complex to cleave phage-derived DNA. Our data further reveal an anti-Thoeris protein, denoted Tad2, which is a \"sponge\" that sequesters the immune signaling molecules produced by Thoeris TIR-domain proteins in response to phage. Our results demonstrate that phages encode an arsenal of anti-defense proteins that can disable a variety of bacterial defense mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that binds DNA and regulates genes in response to halogenated and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. AHR also regulates the development and function of the liver and the immune system. In the canonical pathway, AHR binds a consensus DNA sequence, termed the xenobiotic response element (XRE), recruits protein coregulators, and regulates target gene expression. Emerging evidence suggests that AHR may regulate gene expression via an additional pathway, by binding to a non-consensus DNA sequence termed the non-consensus XRE (NC-XRE). The prevalence of NC-XRE motifs in the genome is not known. Studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter genes provide indirect evidence of AHR-NC-XRE interactions, but direct evidence for an AHR-NCXRE interaction that regulates transcription in a natural genomic context is lacking. Here, we analyzed AHR binding to NC-XRE DNA on a genome-wide scale in mouse liver. We integrated ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data and identified putative AHR target genes with NC-XRE motifs in regulatory regions. We also performed functional genomics at a single locus, the mouse Serpine1 gene. Deleting NC-XRE motifs from the Serpine1 promoter reduced the upregulation of Serpine1 by TCDD, an AHR ligand. We conclude that AHR upregulates Serpine1 via NC-XRE DNA. NC-XRE motifs are prevalent throughout regions of the genome where AHR binds. Taken together, our results suggest that AHR regulates genes via NC-XRE motifs. Our results will also improve our ability to identify AHR target genes and their physiologic relevance.",

Yet, due to the prohibitive cost of high-depth WGS, most large-scale genetic association studies use genotyping arrays or high-depth whole exome sequencing (WES). Here we propose a novel, cost-effective method, which we call \"Whole Exome Genome Sequencing\" (WEGS), that combines low-depth WGS and high-depth WES with up to 8 samples pooled and sequenced simultaneously (multiplexed). We experimentally assess the performance of WEGS with four different depth of coverage and sample multiplexing configurations. We show that the optimal WEGS configurations are 1.7-2.0 times cheaper than standard WES (no-plexing), 1.8-2.1 times cheaper than high-depth WGS, reach similar recall and precision rates in detecting coding variants as WES, and capture more population-specific variants in the rest of the genome that are difficult to recover when using genotype imputation methods. We apply WEGS to 862 patients with peripheral artery disease and show that it directly assesses more known disease-associated variants than a typical genotyping array and thousands of non-imputable variants per disease-associated locus.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules (MTs) are large cytoskeletal polymers, composed of {beta}-tubulin heterodimers, capable of stochastically converting from polymerizing to depolymerizing states and vice-versa. Depolymerization is coupled with hydrolysis of GTP within {beta}-tubulin. Hydrolysis is favored in the MT lattice compared to free heterodimer with an experimentally observed rate increase of 500 to 700 fold, corresponding to an energetic barrier lowering of 3.8 to 4.0 kcal/mol. Mutagenesis studies have implicated -tubulin residues, :E254 and :D251, as catalytic residues completing the {beta}-tubulin active site of the lower heterodimer in the MT lattice. The mechanism for GTP hydrolysis in the free heterodimer, however, is not understood. Additionally, there has been debate concerning whether the GTP-state lattice is expanded or compacted relative to the GDP-state and whether a \"compacted\" GDP-state lattice is required for hydrolysis. In this work, extensive QM/MM simulations with transition-tempered metadynamics free energy sampling of compacted and expanded inter-dimer complexes, as well as free heterodimer, have been carried out to provide clear insight into the GTP hydrolysis mechanism. :E254 was found to be the catalytic residue in a compacted lattice, while in the expanded lattice disruption of a key salt bridge interaction renders :E254 less effective. The simulations reveal a barrier decrease of 3.8 {+/-} 0.5 kcal/mol for the compacted lattice compared to free heterodimer, in good agreement with experimental kinetic measurements. Additionally, the expanded lattice barrier was found to be 6.3 {+/-} 0.5 kcal/mol higher than compacted, demonstrating that GTP hydrolysis is variable with lattice state and slower at the MT tip.\n\nSignificance StatementMicrotubules (MTs) are large and dynamic components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton with the ability to stochastically convert from a polymerizing to a depolymerizing state and vice-versa. Depolymerization is coupled to the hydrolysis of guanosine-5-triphosphate (GTP), which is orders of magnitude faster in the MT lattice than in free tubulin heterodimers. Our results computationally ascertain the catalytic residue contacts in the MT lattice that accelerate GTP hydrolysis compared to the free heterodimer as well as confirm that a compacted MT lattice is necessary for hydrolysis while a more expanded lattice is unable to form the necessary contacts and thereby hydrolyze GTP.",

    "abstract": "A common feature among nearly all Gram-negative bacteria is the requirement for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. LPS provides structural integrity to the bacterial membrane which aids bacteria in maintaining their shape and acts as a barrier from environmental stress and harmful substances such as detergents and antibiotics. Recent work has demonstrated that Caulobacter crescentus can survive without LPS due to the presence of the anionic sphingolipid ceramide-phosphoglycerate. Based on genetic evidence, we predicted that protein CpgB functions as a ceramide kinase and performs the first step in generating the phosphoglycerate head group. Here, we characterized the kinase activity of recombinantly expressed CpgB and demonstrated that it can phosphorylate ceramide to form ceramide 1-phosphate. The pH optimum for CpgB was 7.5, and the enzyme required Mg2+ as a cofactor. Mn2+, but not other divalent cations, could substitute for Mg2+. Under these conditions, the enzyme exhibited typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to NBD-C6-ceramide (Km,app=19.2 {+/-} 5.5 M; Vmax,app=2586.29 {+/-} 231.99 pmol/min/mg enzyme) and ATP (Km,app=0.29 {+/-} 0.07 mM; Vmax,app=10067.57 {+/-} 996.85 pmol/min/mg enzyme). Phylogenetic analysis of CpgB revealed that CpgB belongs to a new class of ceramide kinases which is distinct from its eukaryotic counterpart; furthermore, the pharmacological inhibitor of human ceramide kinase (NVP-231) had no effect on CpgB. The characterization of a new bacterial ceramide kinase opens avenues for understanding the structure and function of the various microbial phosphorylated sphingolipids.",

The mechanism by which PI3K{beta} prioritizes interactions with various membrane tethered signaling inputs, however, remains unclear. Previous experiments have not been able to elucidate whether interactions with membrane-tethered proteins primarily control PI3K{beta} localization versus directly modulate lipid kinase activity. To address this gap in our understanding of PI3K{beta} regulation, we established an assay to directly visualize and decipher how three binding interactions regulate PI3K{beta} when presented to the kinase in a biologically relevant configuration on supported lipid bilayers. Using single molecule Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy, we determined the mechanism controlling membrane localization of PI3K{beta}, prioritization of signaling inputs, and lipid kinase activation. We find that auto-inhibited PI3K{beta} must first cooperatively engage a single RTK-derived tyrosine phosphorylated (pY) peptide before it can engage either G{beta}G{gamma} or Rac1(GTP). Although pY peptides strongly localize PI3K{beta} to membranes, they only modestly stimulate lipid kinase activity. In the presence of either pY/G{beta}G{gamma} or pY/Rac1(GTP), PI3K{beta} activity is dramatically enhanced beyond what can be explained by the increase in membrane avidity for these complexes. Instead, PI3K{beta} is synergistically activated by pY/G{beta}G{gamma} and pY/Rac1(GTP) through a mechanism of allosteric regulation.",

    "abstract": "Since CASP14, AlphaFold2 has become the standard method for protein tertiary structure prediction. One remaining challenge in the field is to further improve the accuracy of AlphaFold2-based protein structure prediction. To address this challenge, we developed a new version of the MULTICOM system to sample diverse multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and structural templates to improve the input for AlphaFold2 to generate structural models. The models are then ranked by both the pairwise model similarity and AlphaFold2 self-reported model quality score. The top ranked models are further refined by a novel structure alignment-based refinement method powered by Foldseek. Moreover, for a monomer target that is a subunit of a protein assembly (complex), MULTICOM integrates tertiary and quaternary structure prediction together to account for tertiary structural changes induced by protein-protein interaction in the assembly. The MULTICOM system participated in the tertiary structure prediction in the 15th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP15) in 2022 as server and human predictors. Our best server predictor (MULTICOM_refine) ranked 3rd among 47 CASP15 server predictors and our best human predictor (MULTICOM) ranked 7th among all 132 human and server predictors. The average GDT-TS score and TM-score of the first structural models that MULTICOM_refine predicted for 94 CASP15 domains are [~]0.80 and [~]0.92, 9.6% and 8.2% and higher than [~]0.73 and 0.85 of the standard AlphaFold2 predictor respectively. The results demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve the accuracy of the AlphaFold2-based protein tertiary structure prediction.

    "abstract": "Biochemical processes within the living cell occur in a highly crowded environment. The phenomenon of macromolecular crowding is not an exclusive feature of the cytoplasm and can be observed in the densely protein-packed, nonhomogeneous cellular membranes and at the membrane interfaces. Crowding affects diffusional and conformational dynamics of proteins within the lipid bilayer, and modulates the membrane organization. However, the non-invasive quantification of the membrane crowding is not trivial. Here, we developed the genetically- encoded fluorescence-based sensor for probing the macromolecular crowding at the membrane interfaces. Two sensor variants, both composed of fluorescent proteins and a membrane anchor, but differing by the flexible linker domains were characterized in vitro, and the procedures for the membrane reconstitution were established. Lateral pressure induced by membrane-tethered synthetic and protein crowders altered the sensors conformation, causing increase in the intramolecular Forsters resonance energy transfer. The effect of protein crowders only weakly correlated with their molecular weight, suggesting that other factors, such as shape and charge play role in the quinary interactions. Upon their expression, the designed sensors were localized to the inner membrane of E. coli, and measurements performed in extracted membrane vesicles revealed low level of interfacial crowding. The sensors offer broad opportunities to study interfacial crowding in a complex environment of native membranes, and thus add to the toolbox of methods for studying membrane dynamics and proteostasis.",

    "abstract": "Despite the progress made in identifying cellular factors and mechanisms that predict progression and metastasis, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of death for women in the US. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas and mouse models of spontaneous and invasive mammary tumorigenesis, we identified that loss of function of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is a predictor of metastasis and survival. Histologic analysis of Irf5-/- mammary glands revealed expansion of luminal and myoepithelial cells, loss of organized glandular structure, and altered terminal end budding and migration. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses of primary mammary epithelial cells from Irf5+/+ and Irf5-/-littermate mice revealed IRF5-mediated transcriptional regulation of proteins involved in ribosomal biogenesis. Using an invasive model of breast cancer lacking Irf5, we demonstrate that IRF5 re-expression inhibits tumor growth and metastasis via increased trafficking of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and altered tumor cell protein synthesis. These findings uncover a new function for IRF5 in the regulation of mammary tumorigenesis and metastasis.\n\nHighlightsLoss of IRF5 is a predictor of metastasis and survival in breast cancer.\n\nIRF5 contributes to the regulation of ribosome biogenesis in mammary epithelial cells.\n\nLoss of IRF5 function in mammary epithelial cells leads to increased protein translation.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer (LC) confers to radical malignancy with a limited recourse of therapy worldwide. Consequently, LC has become the leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women globally. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), one of the major LC types and accountable for a greater share of these cancer-associated deaths, further branches out to adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). A dearth of evident clinical symptoms coupled with the diagnosis feasibility only after advanced metastasis raises the need for precision in treatment apart from the existing chemical drug treatments. Precise guidance can be entailed by targeted therapies, utilizing the potential and thoroughly evaluated differentially expressed genes of cancer under speculation for tumor treatments. Cyclin-dependent kinase regulatory subunit 1B (CKS1B), a member of the conserved cyclin kinase subunit 1 (CKS1) protein family, regulates the cell cycle. Increasing evidence revealed that up-regulation of the CKS1B gene is associated with multiple human-related cancers, indicates its potential use as a targeted therapeutic for early detection and treatment. CKS1B has been found to be associated with poor prognosis in both LUAD and LUSC, while the prognostic significance of CKS1B in other types of cancer is not well established. Herein, we have performed a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of factors involved in LUAD and LUSC with CKS1B and discussed its role as a potential biomarker for early lung cancer detection and treatment. While these evaluations demonstrate the immunotherapeutic features and prognostic value of CKS1B, further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to determine the accuracy of final applications.",

    "abstract": "Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites that infect a wide variety of hosts, including humans. Microsporidian spores possess a unique, highly specialized invasion apparatus involving the polar filament, polaroplast and posterior vacuole. During spore germination, the polar filament is discharged out of the spore forming the hollow polar tube that transports the sporoplasm components including nucleus into the host cell to achieve the invasion. Due to the complicated topological changes occurring in this process, the formation of sporoplasm is unclear. Here, electron microscopy observation and DiI staining confirmed that during spore germination, a large number of vesicles derived from the polaroplast, nucleus and other cytoplasm were transported out via the polar tube. Meanwhile, the posterior vacuole and plasma membrane remained in the empty spore coat. In addition, there was no DiI-labeled membrane around the nucleus in mature spores, whereas a DiI-labeled limit membrane wrapping nucleus was found at the tip of the extruded polar tube, suggesting that the membrane of sporoplasm was formed outside the mature spore. Two Nosema bombycis sporoplasm surface proteins (NbTMP1 and NoboABCG1.1) were located at the polaroplast in mature spores, in the extruded polar tube and on the sporoplasm membrane, which indicated that the polaroplast transported via the polar tube finally became the limiting membrane of the sporoplasm. Golgi-tracker green and Golgi marker protein syntaxin 6 were also found the same model, which was consistent with the transported polaroplast derived from Golgi transformed into the novel sporoplasm membrane during spore germination.\n\nImportanceMicrosporidia, obligate intracellular pathogenic organisms, cause huge economic losses in agriculture and even threaten human health. The key to successful infection of microsporidia is its unique invasion apparatus which includes the polar filament, polaroplast and posterior vacuole. When the spore is activated to geminate, the polar filament uncoils and undergoes a rapid transition into the hollow polar tube that will transport the sporoplasm components including nucleus into a host cell to achieve the invasion. Knowledge of structure difference between polar filament and polar tube, the process of cargo transport in extruded polar tube, and the formation of the sporoplasm membrane are still poorly understood. Herein, we verify that the polar filament evaginates to form the polar tube, which serves as a conduit for transporting elongated nucleus and other sporoplasm components. And we confirm that the transported polaroplast finally transforms into the novel sporoplasm membrane during spore germination. Our study provides new insights into the cargo transportation process of polar tube and origin of the sporoplasm membrane, which serve as foundations for clarifying the microsporidian infection mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Many cells adjust the direction of polarized growth or migration in response to external directional cues. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae orient their cell fronts (also called polarity sites) up pheromone gradients in the course of mating. However, the initial polarity site is often not oriented towards the eventual mating partner, and cells relocate the polarity site in an indecisive manner before developing a stable orientation. During this reorientation phase, the polarity site displays erratic assembly-disassembly behavior and moves around the cell cortex. The mechanisms underlying this dynamic behavior remain poorly understood. Particle-based simulations of the core polarity circuit revealed that molecular-level fluctuations are insufficient to overcome the strong positive feedback required for polarization and generate relocating polarity sites. Surprisingly, inclusion of a second pathway that promotes polarity site orientation generated a mobile polarity site with properties similar to those observed experimentally. This pathway forms a second positive feedback loop involving the recruitment of receptors to the cell membrane and couples polarity establishment to gradient sensing. This second positive feedback loop also allows cells to stabilize their polarity site once the site is aligned with the pheromone gradient.\n\nAuthor summaryCells perform many complex tasks, including directed growth, migration, division and differentiation. To accomplish these tasks, the relevant molecular machinery is localized to specific cellular regions. The asymmetric distribution of cellular components is referred to as cell polarity. Polarity is established by localized activation of the protein Cdc42. Establishing mechanisms that regulate the spatiotemporal activity of Cdc42 is a fundamental area of cell biology. Mating yeast cells dynamically relocate a region of high Cdc42 activity, referred to as the polarity site, and grow toward each other after proper alignment of the sites. We investigated mechanisms that generate dynamic polarity sites by performing particle-based simulations of the biochemical reactions that regulate Cdc42 activity. The reactions contain two positive feedback loops that reinforce Cdc42 activity. The first involves autocatalytic activation of Cdc42 through recruitment of an activator. While necessary for polarity establishment, this feedback loop on its own created a stable polarity site that did not relocate. Incorporation of the second feedback loop, which couples the polarity machinery to extracellular mating signals, generated mobile polarity sites. This feedback loop also provides a mechanism for developing stable alignment of polarity sites. Our findings provide insight into how cells regulate polarity dynamics to accomplish complex tasks.",

    "abstract": "Caprine brucellosis, normally caused by Brucella melitensis in goats, is endemic in Rwanda. However, reliable data on caprine brucellosis in Rwanda is insufficient and data on the prevalence and risk factors linked with goats brucellosis in the district of Nyagatare is unknown. A cross-sectional study was conducted among herds of goats in six sectors of Nyagatare district (n =102), to characterise factors at herd level associated with brucellosis seroprevalence in goats. Serum from goats was screened using both the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) and the Rose Bengal test (RBT). A tested systematic questionnaire was used to obtain data about major risk factors for brucellosis. Brucellosis seroprevalence was 6.8% and 10.7% on RBT and iELISA respectively. The overall seroprevalence was 6.8% on animal level and 16.6% on the herd level in series with RBT and iELISA. Mixing a herd of cattle and goats and history of abortions were the risk factors identified to be considerably linked with Brucella seropositive herd (p < 0.05). This study confirmed that brucellosis is endemic in the area, and a one-health strategy for controlling and preventing brucellosis in the Nyagatare district is strongly recommended. The study recommends an awareness campaign to educate all livestock farmers on brucellosis, further studies are recommended to characterize the Brucella spp. in small ruminants in Rwanda and recommend appropriate control measures.",

    "abstract": "Harmonizing cell types with respect to transcriptomics identity and nomenclature across the single-cell community and assembling them into a common framework is an essential step towards building a standardized Human Cell Atlas. Here we present CellTypist v2.0 (a new version of our automated annotation tool, https://github.com/Teichlab/celltypist), where we develop a predictive clustering tree-based approach to resolve cell type differences across datasets that have different naming conventions, annotation resolution, and technical biases. CellTypist v2.0 accurately quantifies cell-cell transcriptomic similarities and enables robust and efficient cross-dataset meta-analyses. Cell types are placed into a relationship graph that hierarchically defines shared and novel cell subtypes. Application to multiple immune datasets confirms its sensitivity and specificity by recapitulating expert-curated cell annotations. We also apply CellTypist to datasets from eight diseases which all lead to pulmonary fibrosis, and reveal underexplored relationships between healthy cell types and a variety of diseased cell states. Furthermore, we present a workflow for fast cross-dataset integration guided by the harmonized cell types at different levels of annotation granularity. Finally, we apply CellTypist to 12 tissue atlases from 38 datasets, and provide a deeply curated cross-tissue database (www.celltypist.org/organs) with more than 3.6 million cells and 250 cell types. This is complemented by a large collection of machine learning models for automatic cell type annotation across human tissues.",
