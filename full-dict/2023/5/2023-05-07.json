    "abstract": "AimsIntermittent fasting (IF) reduces cardiovascular risk factors in animals and humans, and can protect the heart against ischemic injury in models of myocardial infarction, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. To delineate molecular and cellular adaptations of the heart to IF, we carried out system-wide comprehensive analyses of proteome and phosphoproteome, complemented with transcriptome profiling, followed by functional analysis.\n\nMethods and resultsIn order to understand molecular and cellular remodeling of the heart during IF, we employed advanced mass spectrometry for system-wide profiling of the proteome and phosphoproteome of heart tissues obtained from mice maintained for 6 months on either daily 12- or 16-hour fasting, every-other-day fasting or ad libitum control feeding regimens. We also performed transcriptome analyses using RNA sequencing to evaluate whether the observed molecular responses to IF occur at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels. IF regimens significantly affected pathways that regulate cyclic GMP signaling, lipid and amino acid metabolism, cell adhesion, cell death, and inflammation. Comparison of differentially expressed proteome and transcriptome upon IF showed the higher correlation of pathway alternation in short IF regimen but the inverse correlation of metabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation and immune processes in longer IF regimens. In addition, functional echocardiographic analyses demonstrated that IF enhances stress-induced cardiac performance.\n\nConclusionOur systematic multi-omics study elucidates a molecular framework for understanding how IF impacts the hearts function and its vulnerability to injury and disease.\n\nTranslational perspectiveIntermittent fasting is emerging as a desirable lifestyle adaptation to impact cardiovascular health through the modulation of molecular and cellular mechanisms, and by acting on disease risk factors. Evidence from numerous studies indicates that the fasting cycles are highly and consistently effective in protecting against cardiovascular diseases and improving cardiac health in animals and human. Using multi-omics, here we dissect distinct molecular adaptations of the heart to different intermittent fasting regimens. Our results unveil novel cardioprotective mechanisms and open up new avenues for innovative pharmacological approaches to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cellular responses to stress can cause a similar change in some facets of fitness even if the stresses are different. Lactose as a sole carbon source for Escherichia coli is an established example: too little causes starvation while excessive lactose import causes toxicity as a side-effect. In an E. coli strain that is robust to osmotic and ionic differences in growth media, B REL606, the rate of antibiotic-tolerant persister formation is elevated in both starvation-inducing and toxicity-inducing concentrations of lactose in comparison to less stressful intermediate concentrations. Such similarities between starvation and toxification raise the question of how much the global stress response stimulon differs between them. We hypothesized that a common stress response is conserved between the two conditions, but that a previously shown threshold driving growth rate heterogeneity in a lactose-toxifying medium would reveal that the growing fraction of cells in that medium to be missing key stress responses that curb growth. To test this, we performed RNA-seq in three representative conditions for differential expression analysis. In comparison to nominally unstressed cultures, both stress conditions showed global shifts in gene expression, with informative similarities and differences. Functional analysis of pathways, gene ontology terms, and clusters of orthogonal groups revealed signatures of overflow metabolism, membrane component shifts, and altered cytosolic and periplasmic contents in toxified cultures. Starving cultures showed an increased tendency toward stringent response-like regulatory signatures. Along with other emerging evidence, our results show multiple possible pathways to stress responses, persistence, and possibly other phenotypes. These results suggest a set of overlapping responses that drives emergence of stress-tolerant phenotypes in diverse conditions.",

    "abstract": "Cell cycle arrest and polarized cell growth are commonly used to qualitatively characterize the fate of yeast in response to pheromone. However, the quantitative decision-making process underlying the time-dependent changes in cell fate remains unclear. Here, by observing the multi-dimensional responses at the single-cell level experimentally, we find that yeast cells have various fates. Multiple states are revealed, along with the kinetic switching rates and pathways among them, giving rise to a quantitative landscape of mating response. We developed a theoretical framework using a nonequilibrium landscape and flux theory to account for the cell morphology observed experimentally and performed a stochastic simulation of biochemical reactions to explain the signal transduction and cell growth. Our experimental results established the first global quantitative demonstration of the real-time synchronization of intracellular signaling with their physiological growth and morphological functions which reveals the underlying physical mechanism. This study provides an emerging mechanistic approach for understanding the nonequilibrium global pheromone-regulated cell fate decision-making in growth and morphology.",

    "abstract": "Genes have been historically classified as either essential or non-essential based on their requirement for viability. However, some genes are essential in some genetic backgrounds but non-essential in others, thus challenging the binary classification of gene essentiality. Such dispensable essential genes represent a valuable model for understanding the incomplete penetrance of loss-of-function mutations that is often observed in natural populations. Here, we compiled data from multiple studies on essential gene dispensability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to comprehensively characterize these genes. In analyses spanning different evolutionary time-scales, ranging from S. cerevisiae strains to human cell lines, dispensable essential genes exhibited distinct phylogenetic properties compared to other essential and non-essential genes. Integration of interactions with suppressor genes that can bypass the gene essentiality revealed the high functional modularity of the bypass suppression network. Furthermore, dispensable essential and bypass suppressor gene pairs reflected simultaneous changes in the mutational landscape of S. cerevisiae strains. Importantly, species in which dispensable essential genes were non-essential tended to carry bypass suppressor mutations in their genomes. Overall, our study offers a comprehensive view of dispensable essential genes and illustrates how their interactions with bypass suppressor genes reflect evolutionary outcomes.",

    "abstract": "In an environment with overly abundant lactose, a strain of the Gram-negative bacterium E. coli induces a persister-enriched phenotype and a heterogeneous pattern of growth rates. In high lactose conditions, the majority of cells are fast-growing, while a minority stochastically switch to a slow-growing, persister-prone phenotype that has higher ampicillin tolerance. Previously, bulk bacterial RNA-seq demonstrated broad changes in gene expression profiles for cells cultured in different lactose conditions, revealing multiple pathway regulatory regime switches enhancing its survivability for counteracting osmotic pressure in high lactose conditions with overflow metabolism.\n\nWe hypothesized that a set of unique gene regulatory signatures underlies antibiotic tolerance in the high lactose condition. To further understand the gene regulatory regime in slow-growing cells, the subpopulation of persister-prone cells was enriched with ampicillin treatment. The resulting culture was collected for transcriptomic analysis. The transcriptomic data were then analyzed for differentially expressed genes, signature genes, GO term enrichment, pathway enrichment, and flux balance analysis.\n\nOur results show that under opposing stresses, the cells have similar and divergent responses. Cells exhibit upregulated assimilation pathways and downregulated biosynthesis pathways when encountering stresses. Post ampicillin treatment, cells in both high and low lactose conditions exhibit downregulated central metabolism to reduce growth. In the high-lactose concentration medium after ampicillin treatment, persisters may arise due to ferric imbalance-induced cell growth arrest and gene regulation due to ssrA-mediated downregulation-induced error-prone transcription.",

To investigate the functions of the six maize COI proteins (COI1a, COI1b, COI1c, COI1d, COI2a, and COI2b), we made single, double, and quadruple loss-of-function mutants. Double-mutant coi2a coi2b pollen was inviable, and no homozygous mutant plants were obtained. The coi1 quadruple mutant (coi1-4x) exhibited shortened internode lengths, decreased photosynthesis, leaf discoloration, microelement deficiencies, and accumulation of DWARF9, a DELLA-family protein that represses the gibberellic acid signaling pathway. Co-expression of maize COI and DWARF9 genes in Nicotiana benthamiana showed that the COI proteins lead to proteasome-dependent DELLA degradation. Many genes expressed at lower levels in the coi1-4x mutant are normally induced by gibberellic acid. The majority of these genes are predicted to be bundle sheath or mesophyll-enriched including those encoding C4-specific photosynthetic enzymes. Ectopic expression of maize COI genes in N. benthamiana showed that COI2a is fully localized in the nucleus and interacts with maize JAZ proteins, the canonical COI repressor partners. However, maize COI1a and COI1c proteins showed only partial nuclear localization and failed to bind to most of the JAZ proteins tested. These results show divergent functions of the six COI proteins in the regulation of maize growth and defense pathways.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a widely-used noninvasive brain stimulation technique through electromagnetic induction. Nowadays commercial TMS devices routinely use conventional biphasic pulses for repetitive TMS protocols and monophasic pulses for single-pulse stimulation. They respectively generate underdamped or damped cosinusoidal electric field pulses that have been proven to be power-inefficient. Recently, symmetric field pulses with near-rectangular electric fields show great potential in terms of energy loss and coil heating, but only limited studies have investigated asymmetric field pulses with different asymmetry levels for the induced electric field waveforms. Thus, this paper optimises and searches a wide range of potential current waveforms with the goal of minimising energy loss and coil heating. The optimised results demonstrated that asymmetric field pulses with near-rectangular electric fields have significantly lower power consumption than conventional ones. These optimised waveforms commonly consist of an initial falling phase followed by rapidly rising and falling phases, trailed by a slow decay to zero. Interestingly, the initial phase has a decay time constant around 260 {micro}s and introduces a pulse-duration-dependent negative bias for the current baseline to minimise the energy loss and coil heating. Thus, it is possible to directly design asymmetric field pulses with various asymmetry ratios by using several prediction equations rather than running optimisation. These results also suggest that introducing such an initial current phase could likely significantly reduce the coil heating of most TMS pulse shapes to improve their power efficiencies.",

    "abstract": "2.The dominant paradigm for analysing genetic variation relies on a central idea: all genomes in a species can be described as minor differences from a single reference genome. However, this approach can be problematic or inadequate for bacteria, where there can be significant sequence divergence within a species.\n\nReference graphs are an emerging solution to the reference bias issues implicit in the \"single-reference\" model. Such a graph represents variation at multiple scales within a population - e.g., nucleotide- and locus-level.\n\nThe genetic causes of drug resistance in bacteria have proven comparatively easy to decode compared with studies of human diseases. For example, it is possible to predict resistance to numerous anti-tuberculosis drugs by simply testing for the presence of a list of single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertion/deletions, commonly referred to as a catalogue.\n\nWe developed DrPRG (Drug resistance Prediction with Reference Graphs) using the bacterial reference graph method Pandora. First, we outline the construction of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance reference graph, a process that can be replicated for other species. The graph is built from a global dataset of isolates with varying drug susceptibility profiles, thus capturing common and rare resistance- and susceptible-associated haplotypes. We benchmark DrPRG against the existing graph-based tool Mykrobe and the haplotype-based approach of TBProfiler using 44,709 and 138 publicly available Illumina and Nanopore samples with associated phenotypes. We find DrPRG has significantly improved sensitivity and specificity for some drugs compared to these tools, with no significant decreases. It uses significantly less computational memory than both tools, and provides significantly faster runtimes, except when runtime is compared to Mykrobe on Nanopore data.\n\nWe discover and discuss novel insights into resistance-conferring variation for M. tuberculosis - including deletion of genes katG and pncA - and suggest mutations that may warrant reclassification as associated with resistance.\n\n3. Impact statementMycobacterium tuberculosis is the bacterium responsible for tuberculosis (TB). TB is one of the leading causes of death worldwide; before the coronavirus pandemic it was the leading cause of death from a single pathogen. Drug-resistant TB incidence has recently increased, making the detection of resistance even more vital. In this study, we develop a new software tool to predict drug resistance from whole-genome sequence data of the pathogen using new reference graph models to represent a reference genome. We evaluate it on M. tuberculosis against existing tools for resistance prediction and show improved performance. Using our method, we discover new resistance-associated variations and discuss reclassification of a selection of existing mutations. As such, this work contributes to TB drug resistance diagnostic efforts. In addition, the method could be applied to any bacterial species, so is of interest to anyone working on antimicrobial resistance.\n\n4.

The impact of rising temperatures and decreasing sea ice on Arctic marine microbial communities is yet not well understood. Microbes form the basis of food webs in the Arctic Ocean, providing energy for larger organisms. Previous studies have shown that Atlantic taxa associated with low light are robust to more polar conditions. In this study, we compared to which extent sea ice melt influences light-associated phytoplankton dynamics and biodiversity over two years at two mooring locations in the Fram Strait. One mooring is deployed in pure Atlantic water, and the second in the intermittently ice-covered Marginal Ice Zone. Time-series analysis of amplicon sequence variants abundance over a two-year period, allowed us to identify communities of co-occurring taxa that exhibit similar patterns throughout the annual cycle. We then examined how alterations in environmental conditions affect the prevalence of species. During high abundance periods of diatoms, polar phytoplankton populations dominated, while temperate taxa were weakly represented. Generally, polar pelagic and ice-associated taxa (such as Fragilariopsis cylindrus or Melosira arctica) were more prevalent in Atlantic conditions whereas temperate taxa (such as Odontella aurita or Proboscia alata) have limited potential to persist in colder ice-impacted waters. In contrast to previous assumptions, we think that sea-ice melt acts as a barrier to the horizontal extent of temperate diatoms by preventing their succession at places strongly influenced by polar conditions such as the melting sea ice.",

However, larger distribution patterns and host associations on isolated Pacific islands with many native and introduced hosts have not been well-documented. Here, we used molecular and culturing techniques to characterize rhizobia from soils and 24 native and introduced legume species on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. We chose two of these isolates to inoculated an endemic legume tree, Erythina sandwicensis to measure nodulation potentials and host benefits. We found that all rhizobia genera can be found in the soil, where only Cupriavidus was found at all sites, although at lower abundance relative to other more common genera such as Rhizobium (and close relatives), Bradyzhizobium, and Devosia. Bradyrhizobium was the most common nodulator of plants, where the strain Bradyrhizobium sp. strain JA1 is a generalist capable of forming nodules on nine different host species, including two native species. In greenhouse nursery inoculations, the two different Bradyrhizobium strains successfully nodulate the endemic E. sandwicensis; both strains equally and significantly increased seedling biomass in nursery inoculations. Overall, this work provides a molecular-based framework in which to study potential native and introduced rhizobia on one of the most isolated archipelagos on the planet.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVariants that disrupt mRNA splicing account for a sizable fraction of the pathogenic burden in many genetic disorders, but identifying splice-disruptive variants (SDVs) beyond the essential splice site dinucleotides remains difficult. Computational predictors are often discordant, compounding the challenge of variant interpretation. Because they are primarily validated using clinical variant sets heavily biased to known canonical splice site mutations, it remains unclear how well their performance generalizes.\n\nResultsWe benchmarked eight widely used splicing effect prediction algorithms, leveraging massively parallel splicing assays (MPSAs) as a source of experimentally determined ground-truth. MPSAs simultaneously assay many variants to nominate candidate SDVs. We compared experimentally measured splicing outcomes with bioinformatic predictions for 3,616 variants in five genes. Algorithms concordance with MPSA measurements, and with each other, was lower for exonic than intronic variants, underscoring the difficulty of identifying missense or synonymous SDVs. Deep learning-based predictors trained on gene model annotations achieved the best overall performance at distinguishing disruptive and neutral variants. Controlling for overall call rate genome-wide, SpliceAI and Pangolin also showed superior overall sensitivity for identifying SDVs. Finally, our results highlight two practical considerations when scoring variants genome-wide: finding an optimal score cutoff, and the substantial variability introduced by differences in gene model annotation, and we suggest strategies for optimal splice effect prediction in the face of these issues.\n\nConclusionSpliceAI and Pangolin showed the best overall performance among predictors tested, however, improvements in splice effect prediction are still needed especially within exons.",

    "abstract": "Increasing global rates of autoimmune and inflammatory disease present a burgeoning threat to human health1. This is compounded by the limited efficacy of available treatments1 and high failure rates during drug development2 - underscoring an urgent need to better understand disease mechanisms. Here we show how genetics could address this challenge. By investigating an intergenic haplotype on chr21q22, independently linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ankylosing spondylitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and Takayasus arteritis3-6, we discover that the causal gene, ETS2, is a master regulator of inflammatory responses in human macrophages and delineate how the risk haplotype increases ETS2 expression. Genes regulated by ETS2 were prominently expressed in affected tissues from chr21q22-associated diseases and more enriched for IBD GWAS hits than almost all previously described pathways. Overexpressing ETS2 in resting macrophages produced an activated effector state that phenocopied intestinal macrophages from IBD7, with upregulation of multiple drug targets including TNF and IL-23. Using a database of cellular signatures8, we identify drugs that could modulate this pathway and validate the potent anti-inflammatory activity of one class of small molecules in vitro and ex vivo. Together, this highlights the potential for common genetic associations to improve both the understanding and treatment of human disease.",

The T. mu upregulated the key enzymes of arginine metabolism iNOS, ASS, OTC and down-regulated ARG1 in CDI mice, resulting in an increase in arginine, citrulline and a decrease in ornithine, which worked together to regulate the host intestinal immune response and alleviate CDI.

    "abstract": "Adaptation to novel environments have been documented at the population, phenotype and genotype level. However, the ecological consequences of this process are often ignored. For example, recent evolutionary history in different environments is expected to lead to increased growth rates and competitive abilities. These traits have been identified as key ingredients underlying species coexistence, which suggests that adaptation to new environments may shape species coexistence patterns. However, this hypothesis remains untested.\n\nTo tackle this issue, we performed experimental evolution of two herbivorous spider mite species (Tetranychus urticae and T. evansi) feeding on tomato plants grown under high or low cadmium concentrations. We combined phenotypic analyses with structural stability theory to show that both the cadmium environment and evolution in it changed the coexistence patterns of the two species by increasing niche differences. In fact, the presence of cadmium reduced interspecific competition and led to facilitation between the two herbivores, entailing stable coexistence independently of the previous evolutionary history. Evolution in the cadmium environment also reduced interspecific competition in the ancestral environment, producing stable coexistence. These results show that evolution in a new environment, even in absence of interspecific competitors, affects long-term species coexistence. Importantly, it highlights that biotic interactions (within or between populations) should be accounted for when describing adaptation to novel environments.",

    "abstract": "The amino acid cysteine is critical for many aspects of life, yet excess cysteine is toxic. Therefore, animals require pathways to maintain cysteine homeostasis. In mammals, high cysteine activates cysteine dioxygenase, a key enzyme in cysteine catabolism. The mechanism by which cysteine dioxygenase is regulated remains largely unknown. We discovered that C. elegans cysteine dioxygenase (cdo-1) is transcriptionally activated by high cysteine and the hypoxia inducible transcription factor (hif-1). hif-1- dependent activation of cdo-1 occurs downstream of an H2S-sensing pathway that includes rhy-1, cysl-1, and egl-9. cdo-1 transcription is primarily activated in the hypodermis where it is sufficient to drive sulfur amino acid metabolism. EGL-9 and HIF-1 are core members of the cellular hypoxia response. However, we demonstrate that the mechanism of HIF-1-mediated induction of cdo-1 functions largely independent of EGL-9 prolyl hydroxylation and the von Hippel-Lindau E3 ubiquitin ligase; classical hypoxia signaling pathway components. We propose that the intersection of hif-1 and cdo-1 reveals a negative feedback loop for maintaining cysteine homeostasis. High cysteine stimulates the production of an H2S signal. H2S then activates the rhy-1/cysl-1/egl-9 signaling pathway, increasing HIF-1-mediated transcription of cdo-1, promoting degradation of cysteine via CDO-1.",

    "abstract": "The phosphoregulation of proteins with multiple phosphorylation sites is governed by biochemical reaction networks that can exhibit multistable behavior. However, the behavior of such networks is typically studied in a single reaction volume, while cells are spatially organized into compartments that can exchange proteins. In this work, we use stochastic simulations to study the impact of compartmentalization on a two-site phosphorylation network. We characterize steady states and fluctuation-driven transitions between them as a function of the rate of protein exchange between two compartments. Surprisingly, the rate of stochastic switching between states depends nonmonotonically on the protein exchange rate, with the highest rate of switching occurring at intermediate exchange rates. At sufficiently small exchange rates, the state of the system and rate of switching are controlled largely by fluctuations in the balance of enzymes in each compartment. This leads to negatively correlated states in the compartments. For large exchange rates, the two compartments behave as a single effective compartment. However, when the compartmental volumes are unequal, the behavior differs from a single compartment with the same total volume. These results demonstrate that exchange of proteins between distinct compartments can regulate the emergent behavior of a common signaling motif.",

Barriers to timely access to biomarker information include no testing ordered3,high nucleic acid input requirements, and problematic turnaround time (TAT) by NGS (> 14 days)4.\n\nHere we report the analytical performance and concordance with next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a highly-multiplexed research use only (RUO) panel using digital PCR (dPCR). The HDPCR NSCLC panel reports the status for variants (SNV, indels, and fusions) in eight actionable genes using amplitude modulation and multi-spectral encoding in dPCR5.\n\nMethodsThe panels analytical sensitivity and reactivity were determined using DNA and RNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue spiked with plasmid DNA or in-vitro transcribed RNA.

Higher order interactions occur when the presence of a third (or more) species changes the pairwise interaction between a focal pair. Recent theoretical work has highlighted the stabilizing role of higher order interactions for large, simulated communities, yet it remains unclear how important higher order effects are in real communities. Here we used experimental communities of aquatic protists to examine the relationship between higher-order interactions and community stability (as measured by the persistence of species in a community). We cultured a focal pair of consumers in the presence of additional competitors and a predator and collected time series data of their abundances. We then fitted competition models with and without HOIs to measure interaction strength between the focal pair across different community compositions. We used survival analysis to measure the persistence of individual species. We found evidence that additional species positively affected persistence of the focal species and that HOIs were present in most of our communities. However, persistence was only linked to HOIs for one of the focal species. Our results vindicate community ecology theory positing that species interactions may deviate from assumptions of pairwise interactions, opening avenues to consider possible consequences for coexistence and community stability.",

    "abstract": "Anxious individuals are known to show impaired decision-making in economic gambling task and in everyday life decisions. This impairment can be due to aversion to uncertainty about outcomes (risk aversion) and/or aversion to negative outcomes (loss aversion). We investigate how non-clinical individuals with high levels of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) (N = 54) behave compared to less anxious subjects (N = 61) in a gambling decision-making task delivered online and designed to separate the distinct influences of risk and loss aversion on decision-making. By modelling subjects choices using computational models derived from Prospect Theory and fitted using Hierarchical Bayesian methods, we estimate individual levels of risk and loss aversion. We also link estimates of these parameters to individual propensity to risk averse behaviours during the COVID pandemic, like wearing safer types of face masks, or completing a COVID vaccination course. We report increased loss aversion in individuals with increased level of GAD compared to less anxious individuals and no differences in risk aversion. We also report no links between risk and loss aversion and attitudes towards COVID and vaccines. These results shed new light on the interplay of anxiety and risk and loss aversion and they can provide useful directions for clinical intervention.\n\n1 Author SummaryIn everyday life, we are constantly faced with decisions in which we need to balance between possible losses and risks. In general, humans are believed to weight losses more than gains, i.e. they are loss averse, and they prefer certain to uncertain outcomes, i.e. they are risk averse. The COVID pandemic made this balance between risks, losses and everyday life even more explicit: should I get a COVID vaccination? What type of mask should I wear? Here, we investigate these constructs using a gambling task delivered online in which participants have to accept or refuse bets involving monetary gains, losses or sure wins. We also capture individual attitudes to COVID and vaccines with a new self-report questionnaire. We find that individuals with high levels of Generalised Anxiety Disorder present higher levels of loss aversion compared to less anxious individuals and no differences in risk aversion. We also report no links between computational measures of risk and loss aversion and attitude to COVID and vaccines, possibly due to limits in using simple tasks to describe behaviours through complex situations like the COVID pandemic.",

While great progress has been made in studying individual proteins in the secretory pathway, measuring and quantifying mechanistic changes in the pathways activity remains challenging due to the complexity of the biomolecular systems involved. Systems biology has begun to address this issue with the development of algorithmic tools for analyzing biological pathways; however most of these tools remain accessible only to experts in systems biology with extensive computational experience. Here, we expand upon the user-friendly CellFie tool which quantifies metabolic activity from omic data to include secretory pathway functions, allowing any scientist to infer protein secretion capabilities from omic data. We demonstrate how the secretory expansion of CellFie (secCellFie) can be used to predict metabolic and secretory functions across diverse immune cells, hepatokine secretion in a cell model of NAFLD, and antibody production in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells.",

The equipment used to collect this behavioral data must effectively limit environmental and experimenter disruptions, to avoid confounding behavior data. Proprietary behavior boxes are expensive, offer limited compatible sensors, and constrain analysis with closed-source hardware and software. Here, we introduce PiE, an open-source, end-to-end, user-configurable, scalable, and inexpensive behavior assay system. The PiE system includes the custom-built behavior box to hold a home cage, as well as software enabling continuous video recording and individual behavior box environmental control. To limit experimental disruptions, the PiE system allows the control and monitoring of all aspects of a behavioral experiment using a remote web browser, including real-time video feeds. To allow experiments to scale up, the PiE system provides a web interface where any number of boxes can be controlled, and video data easily synchronized to a remote location. For the scoring of behavior video data, the PiE system includes a standalone desktop application that streamlines the blinded manual scoring of large datasets with a focus on quality control and assay flexibility. The PiE system is ideal for all types of behavior assays in which video is recorded. Users are free to use individual components of this setup independently, or to use the entire pipeline from data collection to analysis. Alpha testers have included scientists without prior coding experience. An example pipeline is demonstrated with the PiE system enabling the user to record home cage maternal behavior assays, synchronize the resulting data, conduct blinded scoring, and import the data into R for data visualization and analysis.",

We uncovered multiple structural-functional connectivity rules underlying the functional specialization of higher visual cortical areas (HVAs). Individual higher visual areas integrate specific cortical and thalamic inputs with distinct functional biases. Higher order Layer 2/3 and thalamocortical pathways show higher target specificity than feedforward intracortical pathways and might impart specific functional preferences to the recipient HVAs.

SAgAs increased the frequency of regulatory T cells among peptide-specific T cells or induce their anergy/exhaustion or deletion, depending on the type of SAgA (hydrolysable (hSAgA) and non-hydrolysable  click SAgA (cSAgA)) and duration of treatment, whereas their corresponding free peptides induced a more effector phenotype following delayed clonal expansion. Moreover, the N-terminal modification of peptides with aminooxy or alkyne linkers, which was needed for grafting onto hyaluronic acid to make hSAgA or cSAgA variants, respectively, influenced their stimulatory potency and safety, with alkyne-functionalized peptides being more potent and less anaphylactogenic than aminooxy-functionalized peptides. Both SAgA variants significantly delayed anaphylaxis compared to their respective free peptides. The anaphylaxis, which occurred in NOD mice but not in C57BL/6 mice, was dose-dependent but did not correlate with the production of IgG1 or IgE against the peptides. We provide evidence that SAgAs significantly improve the efficacy and safety of peptide-based immunotherapy.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTPeptide-based immunotherapy has several advantages over using full antigen as they are easy to synthetize, chemically modify and customize for precision medicine. However, their use in the clinic has been limited by issues of membrane impermeability, poor stability and potency in vivo, and in some cases, hypersensitivity reactions. Here, we provide evidence that soluble antigen arrays and alkyne-functionalization of peptides could be used as strategies to improve the safety and efficacy of peptide-based immunotherapy for autoimmune diseases by influencing the nature and dynamics of immune responses induced by the peptides.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic benefit to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is currently limited to the subset of cancers thought to possess a sufficient tumor mutational burden (TMB) to allow for the spontaneous recognition of neoantigens (NeoAg) by autologous T cells. We explored whether the response of an aggressive low TMB squamous cell tumor to ICB could be improved through combination immunotherapy using functionally defined NeoAg as targets for endogenous CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We found that, whereas vaccination with CD4+ or CD8+ NeoAg alone did not offer prophylactic or therapeutic immunity, vaccines containing NeoAg recognized by both subsets overcame ICB resistance and led to the eradication of large established tumors that contained a subset of PD-L1+ tumor-initiating cancer stem cells (tCSC), provided the relevant epitopes were physically linked. Therapeutic CD4+/CD8+ T cell NeoAg vaccination produced a modified tumor microenvironment (TME) with increased numbers of NeoAg-specific CD8+ T cells existing in progenitor and intermediate exhausted states enabled by combination ICB-mediated intermolecular epitope spreading. The concepts explored herein should be exploited for the development of more potent personalized cancer vaccines that can expand the range of tumors treatable with ICB.",

    "abstract": "Tumor metastasis requires systemic remodeling of distant organ microenvironments which impacts immune cell phenotypes, population structure, and intercellular communication networks. However, our understanding of immune phenotypic dynamics in the metastatic niche remains incomplete. Here, we longitudinally assayed lung immune cell gene expression profiles in mice bearing PyMT-driven metastatic breast tumors from the onset of primary tumorigenesis, through formation of the pre-metastatic niche, to the final stages of metastatic outgrowth. Computational analysis of these data revealed an ordered series of immunological changes that correspond to metastatic progression. Specifically, we uncovered a TLR-NF{kappa}B myeloid inflammatory program which correlates with pre-metastatic niche formation and mirrors described signatures of CD14+  activated MDSCs in the primary tumor. Moreover, we observed that cytotoxic NK cell proportions increased over time which illustrates how the PyMT lung metastatic niche is both inflammatory and immunosuppressive. Finally, we predicted metastasis-associated immune intercellular signaling interactions involving Igf1 and Ccl6 which may organize the metastatic niche. In summary, this work identifies novel immunological signatures of metastasis and discovers new details about established mechanisms that drive metastatic progression.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=85 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/539153v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1333376org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@77c937org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3b78b1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@70d497_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG In briefMcGinnis et al. report a longitudinal scRNA-seq atlas of lung immune cells in mice bearing PyMT-driven metastatic breast tumors and identify immune cell transcriptional states, shifts in population structure, and rewiring of cell-cell signaling networks which correlate with metastatic progression.\n\nHighlightsO_LILongitudinal scRNA-seq reveals distinct stages of immune remodeling before, during, and after metastatic colonization in the lungs of PyMT mice.\nC_LIO_LITLR-NF{kappa}B inflammation correlates with pre-metastatic niche formation and involves both tissue-resident and bone marrow-derived myeloid cell populations.\nC_LIO_LIInflammatory lung myeloid cells mirror  activated primary tumor MDSCs, suggesting that primary tumor-derived cues induce Cd14 expression and TLR-NF{kappa}B inflammation in the lung.\nC_LIO_LILymphocytes contribute to the inflammatory and immunosuppressive lung metastatic microenvironment, highlighted by enrichment of cytotoxic NK cells in the lung over time.\nC_LIO_LICell-cell signaling network modeling predicts cell type-specific Ccl6 regulation and IGF1-IGF1R signaling between neutrophils and interstitial macrophages.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Insects are unique in terms of their high species diversity and deliver key ecological functions. Despite this importance, we know little about true species numbers and biodiversity trends for most insect orders. A key limitation is a lack of time, funding and taxonomic expertise needed to identify the huge number of often small species, of which many remain undescribed as \"dark taxa\". We here present a holistic, scalable and affordable insect diversity monitoring approach using DNA metabarcoding of the mitochondrial COI gene. Using data from the German Malaise trap program we analyzed 1,815 samples obtained from 2019 and 2020 through 75 traps across Germany. We uncovered 10,803 plausible insect species of which the majority (83.9%) was represented by a single OTU. We estimated another 22,500 potential insect species, which lack reference data or represent undescribed species. The overall number of >33,000 insect species reported here is almost as high as the total number of insect species known for Germany ([~]35,500). As Malaise traps capture only a certain fraction of insect species, we argue that many species recorded here are unknown from Germany or new to science in general. Our approach uses robotics and replicated analysis with on average 1.4 M sequence reads per sample for less than 50 {euro} including supply, labor and maintenance. Our up-scalable analysis of 141 samples within two weeks with one person provides a blueprint for large-scale insect monitoring in almost real time.",

We examined if linaclotide, typically used to treat constipation, may also alter duodenal bicarbonate secretion. Bicarbonate secretion was measured in vivo and in vitro using mouse and human duodenum. Ion transporter localization was identified with confocal microscopy and de novo analysis of human duodenal single cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) was performed. Linaclotide increased bicarbonate secretion in mouse and human duodenum in the absence of CFTR expression or function. Linaclotide-stimulated bicarbonate secretion was eliminated by down-regulated in adenoma (DRA) inhibition, regardless of CFTR activity. Sc-RNAseq identified that 70% of villus cells expressed SLC26A3, but not CFTR, mRNA. Linaclotide increased apical membrane expression of DRA in non-CF and CF differentiated enteroids.

    "abstract": "CorA, the primary magnesium ion channel in prokaryotes and archaea, is a prototypical homopentameric ion channel that undergoes ion-dependent conformational transitions. CorA adopts five-fold symmetric non-conductive states in the presence of high concentrations of Mg2+, and highly asymmetric flexible states in its complete absence. However, the latter were of insufficient resolution to be thoroughly characterized. In order to gain additional insights into the relationship between asymmetry and channel activation, we exploited phage display selection strategies to generate conformation-specific synthetic antibodies (sABs) against CorA in the absence of Mg2+. Two sABs from these selections, C12 and C18, showed different degrees of Mg2+-sensitivity. Through structural, biochemical, and biophysical characterization, we found the sABs are both conformation-specific but probe different features of the channel under open-like conditions. C18 is highly specific to the Mg2+-depleted state of CorA and through negative-stain electron microscopy (ns-EM), we show sAB binding reflects the asymmetric arrangement of CorA protomers in Mg2+-depleted conditions. We used X-ray crystallography to determine a structure at 2.0 [A] resolution of sAB C12 bound to the soluble N-terminal regulatory domain of CorA. The structure shows C12 is a competitive inhibitor of regulatory magnesium binding through its interaction with the divalent cation sensing site. We subsequently exploited this relationship to capture and visualize asymmetric CorA states in different [Mg2+] using ns-EM. We additionally utilized these sABs to provide insights into the energy landscape that governs the ion-dependent conformational transitions of CorA.",

Using genome-scale metabolic models and omics data integration, we modeled and calibrated individual dynamics using monoculture experiments, and coupled these models to capture the metabolism of the community. This digital twin accurately predicted the dynamics of the community, enlightening the contribution of each microbial species to organoleptic compound production. Further metabolic exploration raised additional possible interactions between the bacterial species.

    "abstract": "Phase separation plays an important role in the formation of membraneless compartments within the cell, and intrinsically disordered proteins with low-complexity sequences can drive this compartmentalisation. Various intermolecular forces, such as aromatic-aromatic and cation-aromatic interactions, promote phase separation. However, little is known about how the ability of proteins to phase separate under physiological conditions is encoded in their energy landscapes, and this is the focus of the present investigation. Our results provide a first glimpse into how the energy landscapes of minimal peptides that contain{pi} -{pi} and cation-{pi} interactions differ from the peptides that lack amino acids with such interactions. The peaks in the heat capacity (CV) as a function of temperature report on alternative low-lying conformations that differ significantly in terms of their enthalpic and entropic contributions. The CV analysis and subsequent quantification of frustration of the energy landscape suggest that the interactions that promote phase separation leads to features (peaks or inflection points) at low temperatures in CV, more features may occur for peptides containing residues with better phase separation propensity and the energy landscape is more frustrated for such peptides. Overall, this work links the features in the underlying single-molecule potential energy landscapes to their collective phase separation behaviour, and identifies quantities (CV and frustration metric) that can be utilised in soft material design.",

Here, we describe production by and sensitivity of strains to tailocins produced by Pantoea ananatis and Pantoea stewartii subsp. indologenes. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that these tailocins are derived from Myoviridae family phage like many previously described R type syringacins and R type pyocins, but also suggests that cooption from phage occurred independently of previously described tailocins. Since these tailocin encoding loci are present in the same genomic locations across multiple strains of both species and display a level of divergence that is consistent with other shared regions between the genomes and with vertical inheritance of the locus, we refer to them broadly as  pantailocins.",

    "abstract": "In temperate southeastern Australia over the past two decades there has been a marked progressive increase in human cases of Buruli ulcer, an infection of subcutaneous tissue caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. Native possums are the major local environmental reservoir of M. uclerans as they not only develop Buruli lesions but they also shed M. ulcerans in their excreta. However the way humans acquire M. ulcerans from possums has not been determined. Previous case-control studies, insect field surveys and vector competence studies have suggested a role for mosquitoes in M. ulcerans transmission between possums and humans. To explore these links we conducted an extensive, 4-month structured mosquito field survey and four ad hoc field surveys across an area of 350km2 on the Mornington Peninsula, an area endemic for Buruli ulcer. We then compared spatial and temporal patterns of M. ulcerans-positive mosquito occurrence with M. ulcerans-positive possums (established by previous possum excreta surveys) and human Buruli ulcer cases across the region. We used metabarcoding to assess mosquito blood-feeding host preference and to reconstruct M. ulcerans genomes from positive mosquitoes to test epidemiological inferences. We collected 66,325 mosquitoes spanning 26 different species from 180 repeatedly sampled traps over a 4-month peri oCdul.ex molestus and Aedes notoscriptus were the dominant species (42% and 35% of trapped mosquitoes, respectively). PCR screening 25% of trapped mosquitoes revealed a significant association between M. ulcerans and Ae. notoscriptus (p<0.0001) with a maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of 5.88 M. ulcerans positive mosquitoes per 1,000 tested. Using spatial scanning statistics, we also observed significant overlap between clusters of M. ulcerans-positive Ae. notoscriptus, M. ulcerans-positive possum excreta and human Buruli ulcer cases. Metabarcoding analyses of blood-fed Ae. notoscriptus showed individual mosquitoes had fed both on humans and native possums. Enrichment genome sequencing from PCR-positive mosquitoes confirmed identical M. ulcerans genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles between insects, possums and clinical human isolates within the same regions. These findings indicate that certain mosquito species likely transmit M. ulcerans in southeastern Australia and highlight mosquito control as a plausible means to control the Buruli ulcer epidemic in our region.",

Circadian regulation (endogenous [~]24-hour periodic oscillation of a biologic function) governs many critical physiologic processes. It is unknown whether serum iron levels are regulated by circadian machinery; likewise, the circadian nature of key players of iron homeostasis is unstudied. Here we show that serum iron and hepatic transferrin receptor (TfR) gene (Tfrc) expression exhibit circadian regulation. Daily oscillations of both serum iron and hepatic Tfrc expression are maintained in mice housed in constant darkness, where oscillation reflects an endogenous circadian period. However, oscillations of both serum iron and hepatic Tfrc were ablated when circadian machinery was disrupted in Bmal1 knockout mice. This study provides the first confirmatory evidence that serum iron is circadian regulated and uncovers liver-specific circadian regulation of TfR, a major player in cellular iron uptake.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a major risk factor for a plethora of diseases. The information theory of aging posits that epigenetic information loss, especially alterations in methylation patterns, serves as a principal driver of the aging process. Despite this, the connection between epigenetic information loss and disease has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we mapped tissue-unique methylation patterns in both healthy and pathologically diagnosed organs. Our findings revealed that in multiple diseases and tissues, including kidney in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), liver in liver diseases, and adipose in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), methylation patterns degrade in a specific manner, regressing towards the mean form observed across the body. We interpret this as epigenetic information loss, where tissue-unique patterns erode. By contrast, in pancreas of T2D patients, methylation patterns diverge away from the mean. Information loss is not limited to diseases. Sun exposure, for instance, was associated with information loss in the epidermis, but not in the dermis. Age-related erosion of unique methylation patterns was also observed in brain and breast tissues, while the colon showed divergence. Our findings demonstrate that analyzing methylation patterns in tissue-unique sites can effectively distinguish between patients and healthy controls across a range of diseases. It also underscores the role of epigenetic information loss as a common feature in various pathological conditions.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=181 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/539727v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12fc1c9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5b79e2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19f025corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@540ccd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Tissue unique methylation pattern regress toward the mean upon diseaseA single methylation site, showing low methylation in the liver and high in every other tissue, becomes more methylated in diseased livers.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic drive biases the transmission of alleles in heterozygous individuals, such that Mendels law of equal segregation is violated. Most examples of meiotic drive have been discovered over the past century based on causing sex-ratio distortion or the biased transmission of easily scoreable genetic markers that were linked to drive alleles. More recently, several approaches have been developed that attempt to identify distortions of Mendelian segregation genome-wide. Here we test a candidate female meiotic drive locus in Drosophila melanogaster, identified previously as causing a [~]54:46 distortion ratio using sequencing of large pools of backcross progeny. We inserted fluorescent visible markers near the candidate locus and scored transmission in thousands of individual progeny. We observed a small but significant deviation from the Mendelian expectation, however it was in the opposite direction to that predicted based on the original experiments. We discuss several possible causes of the discrepancy between the two approaches, noting that subtle viability effects are particularly challenging to disentangle from potential small-effect meiotic drive loci. We conclude that pool sequencing approaches remain a powerful method to identify candidate meiotic drive loci, but that genotyping of individual progeny at early developmental stages may be required for robust confirmation.",

    "abstract": "Complex glycans serve important functions in all living systems. Many of these intricate and byzantine biomolecules are assembled employing biosynthetic pathways wherein the constituent enzymes are membrane associated. A signature feature of the stepwise assembly processes is the essentiality of unusual linear long-chain polyprenol phosphate-linked substrates, such as un-decaprenol phosphate in bacteria. In this study we focus on a small enzyme, PglC from Campylobacter, structurally characterized for the first time in 2018, as a detergent solubilized construct. PglC is a monotopic phosphoglycosyl transferase (PGT), that embodies the functional core structure of the entire enzyme superfamily and catalyzes the first membrane-committed step in a glycoprotein assembly pathway. The size of the enzyme is significant as it enables high level computation and relatively facile, for a membrane protein, experimental analysis. Our ensemble computational and experimental results reveal a specific interaction of undecaprenol phosphate with PGT cationic residues and suggest a role for critical conformational transitions and electrostatic steering in substrate recognition, overcoming significant energetic barriers to binding. The study highlights that computation, guided by fundamental chemical principles, can advance the study of biochemical processes at membrane bilayers and provide chemical insight at a molecular level that cannot be derived by experiment alone.\n\nInsert Table of Contents artwork here\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=169 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/539694v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (100K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19a38d9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a41d8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@168e48borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1749bd8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Mechanical signals play a vital role in cell biology and is a vast area of research. Thus, there is motivation to understand cell deformation and mechanobiological responses. However, the ability to controllably deform cells in the ultrasonic regime and test their response is a noted challenge throughout the literature. Quantifying and eliciting an appropriate stimulus has proven to be difficult, resulting in methods that are either too aggressive or oversimplified. Furthermore, the ability to gain a real-time insight into cell deformation and link this with the biological response is yet to be achieved. One application of this understanding is in ultrasonic surgical cutting, which is a promising alternative to traditional methods, but with little understanding of its effect on cells. Here we present the image based ultrasonic cell shaking test, a novel method that enables controllable loading of cells and quantification of their response to ultrasonic vibrations. Practically, this involves seeding cells on a substrate that resonates at ultrasonic frequencies and transfers the deformation to the cells. This is then incorporated into microscopic imaging techniques to obtain high-speed images of ultrasonic cell deformation that can be analysed using digital image correlation techniques. Cells can then be extracted after excitation to undergo analysis to understand the biological response to the deformation. This method could aid in understanding the effects of ultrasonic stimulation on cells and how activated mechanobiological pathways result in physical and biochemical responses.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo make steerable needles more effective, researchers have been trying to minimize turning radius, develop mechanics-based models, and simplify control. This paper introduces a novel cable-driven steerable needle that has a 3mm turning radius based on tape spring mechanics, which sets a new minimum turn radius in stiffness-matched tissue models. Methods: We characterize the turn radius and the forces that affect control and performance and create predictive models to estimate required insertion forces and maximum insertion depth. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of a task outside the capabilities of a conventional needle. Results: Minimal force is required to maintain bends, allowing surrounding tissue to fix them in place, and minimal energy is required to propagate bends, allowing the device to navigate easily through various tissue phantoms. The turn radius of the device is independent of surrounding tissue stiffness, making for simple and precise control. We show that all aspects of performance depend on minimizing the tip cutting force. Under ultrasound guidance, we successfully navigate into and then follow a deep blood vessel model at a steep angle of approach. Conclusion: This design allows the system to accurately control the direction of the device while maintaining a smaller turn radius than other steerable needles, providing the potential to broaden access to challenging targets in patients.",

    "abstract": "Pangenome analysis is a computational method for identifying genes that are present or absent from a group of genomes, which helps to understand evolutionary relationships and to identify essential genes. While current state-of-the-art approaches for calculating pangenomes comprise various software tools and algorithms, these methods can have limitations such as low sensitivity, specificity, and poor performance on specific genome compositions. A common task is the identification of core genes, i.e., genes that are present in (almost) all input genomes. However, especially for species with high sequence diversity, e.g., higher taxonomic orders like genera or families, identifying core genes is challenging for current methods. We developed RIBAP (Roary ILP Bacterial core Annotation Pipeline) to specifically address these limitations. RIBAP utilizes an integer linear programming (ILP) approach that refines the gene clusters initially predicted by the pangenome pipeline Roary. Our approach performs pairwise all-versus-all sequence similarity searches on all annotated genes for the input genomes and translates the results into an ILP formulation. With the help of these ILPs, RIBAP has successfully handled the complexity and diversity of Chlamydia, Klebsiella, Brucella, and Enterococcus genomes, even when genomes of different species are part of the analysis. We compared the results of RIBAP with other established and recent pangenome tools (Roary, Panaroo, PPanGGOLiN) and showed that RIBAP identifies all-encompassing core gene sets, especially at the genus level.

    "abstract": "Mass spectrum (MS) data volumes increase with an improved ion acquisition ratio and a highly accurate mass spectrometer. However, the most widely used data format, mzML, does not take advantage of compression methods and improved read performances. Several compression algorithms have been proposed in recent years, and they consider a number of factors, including, numerical precision, metadata read strategies and the compression performance. Due to limited compression ratio, the high-throughput MS data format is still quite large. High bandwidth and memory requirements severely limit the applicability of MS data analysis in cloud and mobile computing. ComboComp is a comprehensive improvement to the Aird data format. Instead of using the general-purpose compressor directly, ComboComp uses two integer-purpose compressors and four general-purpose compressors, and obtains the best compression combination with a dynamic decider, achieving the most balanced compression ratio among all the numerous varieties of compressors. ComboComp supports a seamless extension of the new integer and generic compressors, making it an evolving compression framework. The improvement of compression rate and decoding speed greatly reduces the cost of data exchange and real-time decompression, and effectively reduces the hardware requirements of MS data analysis. Analyzing mass spectrum data on IoT devices can be useful in real-time quality control, decentralized analysis, collaborative auditing, and other scenarios. We tested ComboComp on 11 datasets generated by commonly used MS instruments. Compared with Aird-ZDPD, the compression size can be reduced by an average of 12.9%. The decompression speed is increased by an average of 27.1%. The average compression time is almost the same as that of ZDPD. The high compression rate and decoding speed make the Aird format effective for data analysis on small memory devices. This will enable MS data to be processed normally even on IoT devices in the future. We provide SDKs in three languages, Java, C# and Python, which offer optimized interfaces for the various acquisition modes. All the SDKs can be found on Github: https://github.com/CSi-Studio/Aird-SDK.",

Subsequently, pain-associated effusion-synovitis were characterized into subregions (patellar, central, and posterior) using an anatomical segmentation model.\n\nResultsWe found that the volumes of pain-associated effusion-synovitis were more sensitive and reliable indicators of pain symptoms than the overall volumes in the central and posterior subregions (odds ratio [OR]:3.23 versus 1.77 in the central region, and 3.18 versus 2.66 in the posterior region for severe effusion-synovitis). For mild effusion-synovitis, only pain-associated volume was found to be associated with pain symptoms, but not with overall volume. Patients with significant pain-associated effusion-synovitis in the patellar subregion had the highest increased odds of pain symptoms (OR=4.86).\n\nConclusionTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize deep-learning-based models for the detection and characterization of pain-associated imaging abnormalities.

    "abstract": "Metagenomic high-throughput sequencing brings revolution to the study of human microbiome, clinical pathogen detection, discovery and infection diagnosis, but clinical samples often contain abundant human nucleic acids, leading to a high proportion of host reads. A high-quality human reference genome is essential for removing host reads to make downstream analyses faster and more accurate. The recently published complete human genome, Telomere-to-Telomere CHM13 assembly (T2T), though achieved great success immediately, has yet to be tested for metagenomic sequencing. In this study, we demonstrated the innovation that T2T brings to the field, using a diverse set of samples containing 4.97 billion reads sequenced from 165 libraries, on short- and long-read platforms. To exclude the effect of algorithms in comparison of the genomes, we benchmarked the per-read performance of state-of-the-art algorithms. For short reads, bwa mem was the best-performing algorithm, with positive median of differences (MD) and adjusted p-values <0.001 for all comparisons, while no consistent difference in overall performance was found for long reads algorithms. T2T, when compared to current reference genomes hg38 and YH, significantly improved the per-read sensitivity (MD: 0.1443 to 0.7238 percentage point, all adjusted p-values < 0.001) in removing host reads for all sequencers, and the per-read Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) with T2T was also higher (MD: 1.063 to 16.41 percentage point, all adjusted p-values <0.001). Genomic location of reads exclusively mappable to T2T concentrated mainly in newly added regions. Misclassified reads generally resulted from low complexity sequences, contaminations in reference genomes and sequencing abnormalities. In downstream microbe detection procedures, T2T did not affect true positive calls but greatly reduced false positive calls. The improvement in the ability to correctly remove host reads foretells the success of T2T to serve as the next prevailing reference genome in metagenomic sequencing of samples containing human nucleic acids.",

Furthermore, the software allows the user to turn off the shape evolution of the membrane and focus solely on the organization of proteins. As a result, we can take realistic membrane shapes obtained from, for example, cryo-electron tomography and backmap them into a finer simulation model.

Nevertheless, simultaneously imaging the neuron network and blood vessels in deeper brain layers in a non-invasive manner remains to be a major challenge due to the lack of appropriate labeling fluorescence probe pairs. Herein, we proposed a 2P and 3P fluorescence probe pair for neurovascular imaging. Specifically, the red fluorescence protein (RFP) with an absorption maximum around 550 nm is used as a 3P excited probe to label neurons, and a cyanine derivative dye Q820 has a NIR absorption maximum of 825 nm as a 2P excited probe to label the vasculature, enabling single wavelength excitation at 1650 nm for neurovascular imaging. In particular, the two-photon cross section of Q820 was found to be about 2-fold higher than that of indocyanine green (ICG), a commonly used red two-photon fluorescence labeling agent, at the same excitation wavelength. Benefited from the long wavelength advantage in reducing scattering in both 2 and 3-photon excitation of the fluorescence pairs, we demonstrated in vivo neurovascular imaging in intact mouse brains through white matter and deep into the hippocampus in somatosensory cortex.",

Bone compactness indices remain a valuable tool for interpretation of lifestyle in extinct species when based on sound dataset composition, robust statistical analysis, and consilience with evidence from functional, biomechanical, or paleoenvironmental considerations.",

To study whether the benefits of HMW-HA could be transferred to other animal species, we generated a transgenic mouse overexpressing naked mole-rat hyaluronic acid synthase 2 gene (nmrHAS2). nmrHAS2 mice showed increase in hyaluronan levels in several tissues, and lower incidence of spontaneous and induced cancer, extended lifespan and improved healthspan. The transcriptome signature of nmrHAS2 mice shifted towards that of longer-lived species. The most striking change observed in nmrHAS2 mice was attenuated inflammation across multiple tissues. HMW-HA reduced inflammation via several pathways including direct immunoregulatory effect on immune cells, protection from oxidative stress, and improved gut barrier function during aging. These findings demonstrate that the longevity mechanism that evolved in the naked mole-rat can be exported to other species, and open new avenues for using HMW-HA to improve lifespan and healthspan.",

In particular, the visual color produced from reflected light can be used to determine plant health (VIS-IR) or attract pollinators (Near-UV). However, the UV spectral reflectance studies largely focus on non-crop plants, even though they provide essential information for plant-pollinator interactions.\n\nThis literature review presents an overview of UV-reflectance in crops, identifies gaps in the literature, and contributes new data based on strawberry cultivars. The study found that most crop spectral reflectance studies relied on lab-based methodologies and examined a wide spectral range (Near UV to IR). Moreover, the plant family distribution largely mirrored global food market trends.\n\nThrough a spectral comparison of white flowering strawberry cultivars, this study discovered visual differences for pollinators in the Near UV and Blue ranges. The variation in pollinator visibility within strawberry cultivars underscores the importance of considering UV spectral reflectance when developing new crop breeding lines and managing pollinator preferences in agricultural fields.",

The present study aims to identify potential targets capable of reversing the disease-specific molecular alterations and elucidate their possible action mechanism. Our study uses combinations of different methods, such as genome-scale metabolic modelling, directional protein-protein interaction network, connectivity map, and network controllability, to identify potential targets in NASH. Our approach yielded three promising targets, BAG6, CASP3, and CYCS, and captured their effects on inflammation, fibrosis, steatosis, and apoptosis. The association of CASP3 and CYCS with NASH are already reported in the literature. So BAG6 was selected as a novel target. In the Huh-7 cell-line, its ablation reduced fatty acid accumulation and decreased levels of NASH-signature transcripts, supporting our hypothesis on BAG6 as a potential NASH target.",

    "abstract": "Spatially-resolved datasets are revolutionizing knowledge in molecular biology, yet are under-utilized for questions in evolutionary biology. To gain insight from these large-scale datasets of spatial organization, we need mathematical representations and modeling techniques that can both capture their complexity, but also allow for mathematical tractability. Specifically, it is hard to link previous deme-based or lattice-based models with datasets exhibiting complex patterns of spatial organization and the role of heterogeneous population structure in shaping evolutionary dynamics is still poorly understood. Evolutionary graph theory utilizes the mathematical representation of networks as a proxy for population structure and has started to reshape our understanding of how spatial structure can direct evolutionary dynamics. However, previous results are derived for the case of a single mutation appearing in the population. Complex traits arise from interactions among multiple genes and these interaction can result in rugged fitness landscapes, where evolutionary dynamics can vastly differ from the dynamics of stepwise fixation. Here, we develop a unifying theory of how heterogenous population structure shapes evolutionary dynamics on rugged fitness landscapes. We show that even a simple extension to a two- mutational landscape can exhibit evolutionary dynamics not observed in deme-based models and that cannot be predicted using previous single-mutation results. We also show how to link these models to spatially-resolved datasets and build the networks of the stem cell niches of the bone marrow. We show that these cellular spatial architectures reduce the probability of neoplasm initiation across biologically relevant mutation rate and fitness distributions.",

    "abstract": "Loss of genetic diversity in elite crop breeding pools can severely limit long-term genetic gains, and limits gain for new traits that are becoming important as the climate changes, such as heat tolerance. Introgression of specific traits and pre-breeding germplasm is an alternative to introduce new diversity, however, introgression is typically slow and challenging. Here we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to select sets of parents which between them contain chromosome segments with very high segment breeding values for the target trait, as an alternative to truncation selection on genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs). Repeated recurrent selection and intercrossing for a yield trait, beginning with a founder population of wheat genotypes and guided by the GA, was compared to repeated recurrent selection and to optimal contribution selection (OCS) on yield GEBV. After 100 generations of selection and intercrossing, truncation selection had exhausted the genetic diversity, while considerable diversity remained in the GA population. In some situations, particularly where the number of parents crossed each generation was relatively small and the number of progeny per cross was large, gain from the GA exceeded that from truncation selection. Compared to OCS, selection under the GA maintained more useful diversity, i.e. diverse segments with high yield GEBV, which allowed it to maintain higher rates of gain for longer. These results indicate that GA-based parent selection could be a promising method to maintain diverse alleles with higher genetic merit in breeding populations with little additional effort to a regular genomic selection program.\n\nKey messageA segment-stacking algorithm can outperform optimal contribution selection and truncation selection in long-term crop breeding programs, particularly with small populations, while also maintaining more useful diversity.",

In this study, we investigate the evolution of the genomic signatures caused by endogenous and external mutagenic stimuli and their interplay with complex structural variants. We superimposed mutational signatures and phylogenetic analyses of matched serial tumors from patients with urothelial cancer to define the evolutionary patterns of these processes. We show that APOBEC3-induced mutations are clonal and early, whereas mutational bursts comprising hundreds of late subclonal mutations are induced by chemotherapy. Using a novel genome graph computational paradigm, we observed frequent circular high copy-number amplicons characteristic of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) involving double-minutes, breakage-fusion-bridge, and tyfonas events. We characterized the distinct temporal patterns of APOBEC3 mutations and chemotherapy-induced mutations within ecDNA, gaining new insights into the timing of these events relative to ecDNA biogenesis. Finally, we discovered that most CCND1 amplifications in urothelial cancer arise within circular ecDNA amplicons. These CCND1 ecDNA amplification events persisted and increased in complexity incorporating additional DNA segments potentially contributing selective fitness advantage to the evolution of treatment resistance. Our findings define fundamental mechanisms driving urothelial cancer evolution and have therapeutic implications for treating this disease.",

The choice of protein structure relies on direct application from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), homology- or de-novo modeling. Recent de-novo models, such as AlphaFold2, require little preprocessing and omit the need to navigate the many parameters of choosing an experimentally determined model. Yet, the experimentally determined structure still has much to offer, why it should be of interest to the community to ease the choice of experimentally determined models. We provide an open-source software package, PDBminer, to mine both the AlphaFold Database (AlphaFoldDB) and the PDB based on search criteria set by the user. This tool provides an up-to-date, quality-ranked table of structures applicable for further research. PDBminer provides an overview of the available protein structures to one or more input proteins, parallelizing the runs if multiple cores are specified. The output table reports the coverage of the protein structures aligned to the UniProt sequence, overcoming numbering differences in PDB structures, and providing information regarding model quality, protein complexes, ligands, and nucleotide binding. The PDBminer2coverage and PDBminer2network tools assist in visualizing the results.

    "abstract": "Protein structure determination is a critical aspect of biological research, enabling us to understand protein function and potential applications. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial intelligence have led to the development of several protein structure prediction tools, such as AlphaFold2 and ColabFold. However, their performance has primarily been evaluated on well-characterised proteins, and comparisons using proteins with poor reference templates are lacking. In this study, we evaluated three modelling tools on their prediction of over 1000 snake venom toxin structures with no reference templates. Our findings show that AlphaFold2 (AF2) performed the best across all assessed parameters. We also observed that ColabFold (CF) only scored slightly worse than AF2, while being computationally less intensive. All tools struggled with regions of intrinsic disorder, such as loops and propeptide regions, and performed well in predicting the structure of functional domains. Overall, our study highlights the importance of exercising caution when working with proteins that have poor reference templates, are large, and contain flexible regions. Nonetheless, leveraging computational structure prediction tools can provide valuable insights into the modelling of protein interactions with different targets and reveal potential binding sites, active sites, and conformational changes, as well as into the design of potential molecular binders for reagent, diagnostic, or therapeutic purposes.\n\nStatementRecent advances in machine learning have led to the development of new protein structure prediction tools. However, these tools have mainly been tested on well-known proteins and their performance on proteins without known templates is unclear.

LEPR+ stromal cells are identified as central regulators of hematopoiesis through predicted interactions with all cells in the marrow. Inflammatory niche remodeling and the resulting deprivation of critical HSPC regulatory factors is predicted to repress distinct high-output HSC subsets in NPM1-mutated AML, with relative resistance of clonal cells. Stromal gene signatures reflective of niche remodeling are associated with reduced relapse rates and favorable outcome after chemotherapy, across all genetic risk categories.

    "abstract": "Fecal pharmacokinetics is crucial in developing treatment design and evaluating gastrointestinal motility; however, it has not been yet elucidated. This study aimed to elucidate the fecal pharmacokinetics in mice orally administered vancomycin and establish a pharmacokinetic model with interpretable system parameters. In this study, we quantified the antibiotic concentrations in fecal samples collected at high frequency from C57BL/6J mice treated with single oral doses of low and high (1 and 20 mg/mL) concentrations of vancomycin. Samples were taken at approximately 4-hour intervals after administration of antibiotics, making it possible to track the dynamics of vancomycin in the feces with high resolution. Mice structurally pool contents in the stomach and cecum, so we constructed an intestinal transit model that compartmentalizes these organs. Two models were built based on the functional form of gastric content elimination, and physiological parameters such as gastric emptying and intestinal transit time were estimated using high-resolution actual data from each mouse. Fortunately, both models were suitable for evaluating the antibiotic concentrations in feces. By simulation, we confirmed that our estimates of model parameters, which are quite difficult to measure experimentally, are satisfactory. Importantly, this study is applicable to fundamental research relating to pharmacokinetics in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nNEW & NOTEWORTHYThis study tracked the pharmacokinetics of orally administered vancomycin by measuring its concentration in feces and described it using a mathematical model based on the physiological characteristics of mice to replicate these dynamics.

    "abstract": "We have designed an algorithm implemented in a software platform for the development of new anti-tumor drugs in the form of small molecules. Several molecules were generated for the treatment of patients with lung cancer as an example. At the initial stage, we identified the targets for the therapy. Firstly, we evaluated the expression profile of the genes most associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with lung cancer using deep learning. Additional patients data were gained by generative adversarial neural networks (GAN) technology. As a result, a set of genes was successfully selected, which expression was associated with poor prognosis. We identified the genes that could distinguish normal tissue from tumor tissue using another deep learning model that was trained to predict normal and tumor tissue based on gene expression. The other genes were considered as targets for targeted lung cancer therapy. After that, a module was developed that predicts the interactions of inhibitors with proteins. For this purpose, the amino acid sequences of proteins were represented in vector form, as well as formulas of chemical compounds interacting with proteins. In addition, a deep learning-based module was developed that predicts the IC50 in experiments on cell lines. Virtual pre-clinical trials with the selected inhibitors were performed to identify relevant cell lines for laboratory experiments. As a result, the study obtained formulas of several molecules with the predicted binding to certain proteins.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation to potential threat cues in feeding regulation is key for animal survival. Maladaptation in balancing internal energy needs and external threat cues may result in eating disorders. However, brain mechanisms underlying such maladaptation remain elusive. Here, we identified that the basal forebrain (BF) sends glutamatergic projections to glutamatergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Glutamatergic neurons in both the BF and the VTA displayed correlated responses to various external stressors. Notably, in vivo manipulation of BF terminals in the VTA revealed that the glutamatergic BFVTA circuit reduces appetite, increases locomotion, and elicits avoidance. In consistence, activation of VTA glutamatergic neurons reduced body weight, blunted food motivation, and caused hyperactivity with behavioral signs of anxiety, all hallmarks of typical anorexia phenotypes. Importantly, activation of BF glutamatergic terminals in the VTA reduced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Collectively, our results point to overactivation of the glutamatergic BFVTA circuit as a potential cause of anorexia-like phenotypes involving reduced dopamine release.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Despite decades of research, the underlying molecular and cellular changes of AD remain unresolved, especially in terms of the spatial structure of gene expression changes that correlates with pathology, e.g. amyloid beta (A-beta) plaques. Recent advances in imaging-or sequencing-based single-cell spatial transcriptomics have allowed a systematic dissection of molecular and cell architectures in the brain and other tissues. In this study, we employed the recently developed Stereo-seq technology to spatially profile the whole-genome transcriptomics in the 5xFAD mouse model and established the methodology to analyze the specific neuronal transcriptomic changes spatially correlated with amyloid pathology at single cell resolution. More specifically, we developed a pipeline for integrative image- and non-image-based cell segmentation, VoxelMorph-based non-linear alignment, and Unet-based object detection to achieve reliable transcriptomics analysis at the single-cell resolution, and investigated the spatial relationship between diverse neuronal clusters and A-beta depositions. This work has demonstrated the potential of using the Stereo-seq technology as a powerful tool to investigate AD and other complex neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Antigenic drift is the biggest challenge for mutagenic RNA virus vaccine development. The most fundamental but neglected thing is to determine the immune escape mutation map (IEMM) of 20 amino acids to reveal the rule of the viral immune escape. We use universal protein tags as a linear epitope model to determine the relationship between the epitope mutation and immune escape. To describe and draw amino acid interaction maps, mutations of protein tags are classified into four types: IEM (immune escape mutation), ADERM (antibody-dependent enhancement risk mutation), EQM (equivalent mutation), and IVM (invalid mutation). To make up for the data limitation, the amino acid interaction pairs determined by 3D structure through literature search are simultaneously used to form a more systematic and universal antigen-antibody interaction maps. The results are: (i) one residue interacts with multiple amino acids in antigen-antibody interaction; (ii) Most amino acid replacements are IVM and EQM. (iii) Once aromatic amino acids replace non-aromatic amino acids, the mutation is often inactive. (iv) Substituting residues with the same physical and chemical properties easily lead to IEM. Therefore, this study had important theoretical significance for future research on antigenic drift, antibody rescue and vaccine renewal design.\n\nImportanceWe typed the antigenic epitope mutations into IEM, ADERM, EQM, and IVM types to describe and quantify the results of antigenic mutations. According to the results, the antigen-antibody interaction rule was summarized as one-to-many interaction rule. To sum up, the Epitope mutation rules were defined as IVM and EQM predomination rule, aryl mutation escape rule and homogeneous mutation escape rule.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear envelope is a membrane separating nuclear from cytoplasmic processes. Existing models suggest that damaged DNA moves to the envelope at the edge of the nucleus for repair. Yet, most damaged human DNA does not reposition to the nuclear periphery during repair. Here we show that human cells relocate the nuclear envelope to non-peripheral damaged DNA, providing solid support promoting the reconnection of DNA break ends. Upon DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction, cytoplasmic microtubules poke the nuclear envelope inwards, inducing an extensive network of DSB-capturing nuclear envelope tubules (dsbNETs). The formation of dsbNETs, which encompass the nuclear lamina and the inner and outer nuclear membranes, depends on DNA damage response kinases, dynamic microtubules, the linker of the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) proteins SUN1 and SUN2, nuclear pore protein NUP153, and kinesin KIF5B. Repressing dsbNETs compromises the reassociation of DSB ends. The timely reversal of dsbNETs by the kinesin KIFC3 also promotes repair. DSB ends reconnection is restored in dsbNETs-deficient cells by enlarging the 53BP1 DNA repair center. The lamina-binding domain of SUN1 mediates its entry into the tubules and DSB capture by the envelope. Fusing truncated SUN1 to the NHEJ repair protein KU70 fails to localize SUN1 to the tubules but rescues DSB targeting only to the boundary envelope. Although dsbNETs typically promote accurate DSB repair and cell survival, they are co-opted by the PARP inhibitor olaparib to induce aberrant chromosomes restraining BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cells. We uncover dsbNETs, which bring the nuclear envelope to DSBs for repair and potentiate the efficacy of anti-cancer agents. Our findings revise theories of the structure-function relationship of the nuclear envelope and identify dsbNETs as a critical factor in DNA repair and nuclear organization, with implications for health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Spindle bipolarity is critical for genomic integrity. Given that centrosome number often dictates mitotic bipolarity, tight control of centrosome assembly is vital for the fidelity of cell division. The kinase ZYG-1/Plk4 is a master centrosome factor that is integral for controlling centrosome number and is modulated by protein phosphorylation. While autophosphorylation of Plk4 has been extensively studied in other systems, the mechanism of ZYG-1 phosphorylation in C. elegans remains largely unexplored. In C. elegans, Casein Kinase II (CK2) negatively regulates centrosome duplication by controlling centrosome-associated ZYG-1 levels. In this study, we investigated ZYG-1 as a potential substrate of CK2 and the functional impact of ZYG-1 phosphorylation on centrosome assembly. First, we show that CK2 directly phosphorylates ZYG-1 in vitro and physically interacts with ZYG-1 in vivo. Intriguingly, depleting CK2 or blocking ZYG-1 phosphorylation at putative CK2 target sites leads to centrosome amplification. In the non-phosphorylatable (NP)-ZYG-1 mutant embryo, the overall levels of ZYG-1 are elevated, leading to an increase in centrosomal ZYG-1 and downstream factors, providing a possible mechanism of the NP-ZYG-1 mutation to drive centrosome amplification. Moreover, inhibiting the 26S proteasome blocks degradation of the phospho-mimetic (PM)-ZYG-1, while the NP-ZYG-1 mutant shows partial resistance to proteasomal degradation. Our findings suggest that site-specific phosphorylation of ZYG-1, partly mediated by CK2, controls ZYG-1 levels via proteasomal degradation, limiting centrosome number. We provide a mechanism linking CK2 kinase activity to centrosome duplication through direct phosphorylation of ZYG-1, which is critical for the integrity of centrosome number.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWModeling microbial interactions as sparse and reproducible networks is a major challenge in microbial ecology. Direct interactions between the microbial species of a biome can help to understand the mechanisms through which microbial communities influence the system. Most state-of-the art methods reconstruct networks from abundance data using Gaussian Graphical Models, for which several statistically grounded and computationnally efficient inference approaches are available. However, the multiplicity of existing methods, when applied to the same dataset, generates very different networks. In this article, we present OneNet, a consensus network inference method that combines seven methods based on stability selection. This resampling procedure is used to tune a regularization parameter by computing how often edges are selected in the networks. We modified the stability selection framework to use edge selection frequencies directly and combine them in the inferred network to ensure that only reproducible edges are included in the consensus. We demonstrated on synthetic data that our method generally led to slightly sparser networks while achieving much higher precision than any single method. We further applied the method to gut microbiome data from liver-cirrothic patients and demonstrated that the resulting network exhibited a microbial guild that was meaningful in term of human health.",

    "abstract": "Our perception and decision-making are susceptible to prior context, as seen in serial dependence where our judgment of stimulus magnitude is biased toward what we experienced in previous trials. While serial bias in the spatial domain has been extensively studied, less is known about it for time perception. Furthermore, it is still debatable whether serial dependence arises during perceptual or post-perceptual stages. To investigate this, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on twenty-one participants performing a timing task, which involved two phases - duration encoding and duration reproduction. Participants had to remember the duration of the green coherent motion and wait for a cue to reproduce the perceived duration. The cue could be either \"Response\" or \"No-response\". For the \"No-response\" cue, participants should only passively view the display. We observed that the reproduction error was positively correlated with the prior duration only when the preceding task was also active reproduction. In contrast, encoding the prior duration without reproduction was insufficient to induce serial dependence. Neurally, we observed activated timing-related networks, such as striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, and performance monitoring networks when the trial sequence implicitly predicted a \"Response\" trial. Importantly, the hippocampus showed sensitivity to sequential bias and its activation was negatively correlated with the individuals sequential bias following active reproduction trials, indicating that the recycling of prior information in working memory mingles with the present that leads to serial dependence. These findings highlight the crucial role of memory networks in time-related sequential biases at the post-perceptual stage.\n\nSignificance StatementThis study explores the neural mechanisms measured by fMRI underlying time perception and the factors that can influence our time judgments across trials. Our findings reveal that active reproduction of time duration in the previous trial can bias subsequent estimates, resulting in a serial dependence effect. In contrast, passive viewing of a stimulus without reproducing its duration does not produce this effect. At the neural level, we observed increased activity in memory regions like the hippocampus when sequential biases were reduced. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between hippocampal activation and sequential bias following active reproduction trials. Our findings suggest that the involvement of memory networks mediates how we are influenced by past experiences when judging time.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between genetic perturbations and segregating loci can cause perturbations to show different phenotypic effects across genetically distinct individuals. To study these interactions on a genome scale in many individuals, we used combinatorial DNA barcode sequencing to measure the fitness effects of 8,013 CRISPRi perturbations targeting 1,721 distinct genes in 169 yeast cross progeny (or segregants). We identified 457 genes whose perturbation has different effects across segregants. Several factors caused perturbations to show variable effects, including baseline segregant fitness, the mean effect of a perturbation across segregants, and interacting loci. We mapped 248 interacting loci and found four hub loci that interact with many different perturbations. Perturbations that interact with a given hub exhibit similar epistatic relationships with the hub and show enrichment for cellular processes that may mediate these interactions. These results suggest that an individuals response to perturbations is shaped by a network of perturbation-locus interactions that cannot be measured by approaches that examine perturbations or natural variation alone.",
