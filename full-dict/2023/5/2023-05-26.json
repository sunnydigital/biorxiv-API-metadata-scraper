    "abstract": "The current Covid-19 pandemic emphasizes the dramatic consequences of emerging zoonotic pathogens and stimulates the need for an assessment of the evolution and natural cycle of such microbes in a One Health framework. A number of recent studies have revealed an astonishing diversity of bat-borne Coronaviruses, including in insular environments, which can be considered as simplified biological systems suited for the exploration of the transmission cycles of these viruses in nature. In this work, we present two new lineages of alpha Coronaviruses detected by screening the only two extant New Zealand bat species: the lesser short-tailed bat (Mystacina tuberculata) and the long-tailed bat (Chalinolobus tuberculatus). Infection prevalence reaching 60% in long-tailed bats makes this host-pathogen model relevant for the investigation of maintenance mechanisms in a bat reservoir with peculiar physiological adaptations to temperate climates. A phylogenetic analysis shows that these viral lineages do cluster with Coronaviruses hosted by bat sister species from Australia, supporting co-diversification processes and confirming that the evolution of these viruses is tightly linked to that of their hosts. These patterns provide an interesting framework for further research aiming at elucidating the natural history and biological cycles of these economically-devastating zoonotic viruses.",

    "abstract": "Non-heme iron halogenases (NHFe-Hals) catalyze the direct insertion of a chloride/bromide ion at an unactivated carbon position using a high-valent haloferryl intermediate. Despite more than a decade of structural and mechanistic characterization, how NHFe-Hals preferentially bind specific anions and substrates for C-H functionalization remains unknown. Herein, using lysine halogenating BesD and HalB enzymes as model systems, we demonstrate strong positive cooperativity between anion and substrate binding to the catalytic pocket. Detailed computational investigations indicate that a negatively charged glutamate hydrogen-bonded to irons equatorial-aqua ligand acts as an electrostatic lock preventing both lysine and anion binding in the absence of the other. Using a combination of UV-Vis spectroscopy, binding affinity studies, stopped-flow kinetics investigations, and biochemical assays, we explore the implication of such active site assembly towards chlorination, bromination, and azidation reactivities. Overall, our work highlights previously unknown features regarding how anion-substrate pair binding govern reactivity of iron halogenases that are crucial for engineering next-generation C-H functionalization biocatalysts.",

    "abstract": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects a significant proportion of men aged 40-70 and is caused by cavernous tissue dysfunction. Presently, the most common treatment for ED is phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors; however, this is less effective in patients with severe vascular disease such as diabetic ED. Therefore, there is a need for development of new treatment, which requires a better understanding of the cavernous microenvironment and cell-cell communications under diabetic condition. Pericytes are vital in penile erection; however, their dysfunction due to diabetes remains unclear. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to understand the cellular landscape of cavernous tissues and cell type-specific transcriptional changes in diabetic ED. We found a decreased expression of genes associated with collagen or extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis in diabetic fibroblasts, chondrocytes, myofibroblasts, valve-related lymphatic endothelial cells, and pericytes. Moreover, the newly identified pericyte-specific marker, LBH, in mouse and human cavernous tissues, clearly distinguishing pericytes from smooth muscle cells. Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed that pericytes are involved in angiogenesis, adhesion, and migration by communicating with other cell types in the corpus cavernosum; however, these interactions were highly reduced under diabetic conditions. LBH expression is low in diabetic pericytes, and overexpression of LBH prevents erectile function by regulating neurovascular regeneration. Furthermore, the LBH-interacting proteins (CRYAB and VIM) were identified in mouse cavernous pericytes through LC-MS/MS analysis, indicating that their interactions were critical for maintaining pericyte function. Thus, our study reveals novel targets and insights into the pathogenesis of ED in patients with diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) represent the interactions between transcription factors (TF) and their target genes. GRNs control transcriptional programs involved in growth, development and stress responses, ultimately affecting diverse agricultural traits. While recent developments in accessible chromatin (AC) profiling technologies make it possible to identify context-specific regulatory DNA, learning the underlying GRNs remains a major challenge. We developed MINI-AC (Motif-Informed Network Inference based on Accessible Chromatin), a method that combines AC data from bulk or single-cell experiments with TF binding site information to learn GRNs in plants. We benchmarked MINI-AC using bulk AC datasets from different Arabidopsis thaliana tissues and showed that it outperforms other methods to identify correct TFs binding sites. In maize, a crop with a complex genome and abundant distal AC regions, MINI-AC successfully inferred leaf GRNs with experimentally confirmed, both proximal and distal, TF-target gene interactions. Furthermore, we showed that both AC regions and footprints are valid alternatives to infer AC-based GRNs with MINI-AC. Finally, we combined MINI-AC predictions from bulk and single-cell AC datasets to identify general and cell-type specific maize leaf regulators. Focusing on C4 metabolism, we identified diverse regulatory interactions in specialized cell types for this photosynthetic pathway. MINI-AC represents a powerful tool for inferring accurate AC-derived GRNs in plants and identifying known and novel candidate regulators, improving our understanding of gene regulation in plants.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated how the gender composition of top-cited authors within different subfields of research has evolved over time. We considered 9,071,122 authors with at least 5 full papers in Scopus as of September 1, 2022. Using a previously validated composite citation indicator, we identified the 2% top-cited authors for each of 174 science subfields (Science-Metrix classification) in 4 separate publication age cohorts (first publication pre-1992, 1992-2001, 2002-2011, post-2011). Using NamSor we assigned 3,784,507 authors as men, and 2,011,616 as women (for 36.1% gender assignment uncertain). Men outnumbered women 1.88-fold among all authors, decreasing from 3.93-fold to 1.36-fold over time. Men outnumbered women 3.21-fold among top-cited authors, decreasing from 6.41-fold to 2.28-fold over time. In the youngest (post-2011) cohort, 32/174 (18%) subfields had >=50% women, 97/174 (56%) subfields had >=30% women, and 3 subfields had =<10% women among the top-cited authors. Gender imbalances in author numbers decreased sharply over time in both high-income countries (including the USA) and other countries, but the latter had little improvement in gender imbalances for top-cited authors. In random samples of 100 women and 100 men from the youngest (post-2011) cohort, in-depth assessment showed that most were currently (April 2023) working in academic environments. 32 women and 44 men had some faculty appointment, but only 2 women and 2 men were full professors. Our analysis shows large heterogeneity across scientific disciplines in the amelioration of gender imbalances with more prominent imbalances persisting among top-cited authors and slow promotion pathways even for the most-cited young scientists.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) is a prototypic member of the Spinareoviridae family and has ten double-stranded RNA segments. One copy of each segment must be faithfully packaged into the mature virion, and prior literature suggests that nucleotides (nts) at the terminal ends of each gene likely facilitate their packaging. However, little is known about the precise packaging sequences required or how the packaging process is coordinated. Using a novel approach, we have determined that 200 nts at each terminus, inclusive of untranslated regions (UTR) and parts of the open reading frame (ORF), are sufficient for packaging each S gene segment (S1-S4) individually and together into replicating virus. Further, we mapped the minimal sequences required for packaging the S1 gene segment to 25 5' nts and 50 3' nts. The S1 UTRs alone are not sufficient, but are necessary for packaging, as mutations of the 5' or 3' UTRs led to a complete loss of virus recovery. Using a second novel assay, we determined that 50 5'nts and 50 3' nts of S1 are sufficient to package a non-viral gene segment into MRV. The 5' and 3' termini of the S1 gene are predicted to form a panhandle structure and specific mutations within the predicted stem of the panhandle region led to a significant decrease in viral recovery. Additionally, mutation of six nts that are conserved in the three major serotypes of MRV and are predicted to form an unpaired loop in the S1 3'UTR, led to a complete loss of viral recovery. Overall, our data provide strong experimental proof that MRV packaging signals lie at the terminal ends of the S gene segments and offer support that the sequence requirements for efficient packaging of the S1 segment include a predicted panhandle structure and specific sequences within an unpaired loop in the 3' UTR.",

    "abstract": "SARS CoV-2 nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) is the major pathogenesis factor that inhibits host translation using a dual strategy of impairing initiation and inducing endonucleolytic cleavage of cellular mRNAs. To investigate the mechanism of cleavage, we reconstituted it in vitro on {beta}-globin, EMCV IRES and CrPV IRES mRNAs that use unrelated initiation mechanisms. In all instances, cleavage required Nsp1 and only canonical translational components (40S subunits and initiation factors), arguing against involvement of a putative cellular RNA endonuclease. Requirements for initiation factors differed for these mRNAs, reflecting their requirements for ribosomal attachment. Cleavage of CrPV IRES mRNA was supported by a minimal set of components consisting of 40S subunits and eIF3gs RRM domain. The cleavage site was located in the coding region 18 nucleotides downstream from the mRNA entrance indicating that cleavage occurs on the solvent side of the 40S subunit. Mutational analysis identified a positively charged surface on Nsp1s N-terminal domain (NTD) and a surface above the mRNA-binding channel on eIF3gs RRM domain that contain residues essential for cleavage. These residues were required for cleavage on all three mRNAs, highlighting general roles of Nsp1-NTD and eIF3gs RRM domain in cleavage per se, irrespective of the mode of ribosomal attachment.",

    "abstract": "O_LIJolly Seber (JS) models are an appealing class of capture-recapture models for modeling open populations because they allow for inferences about an array of population parameters, including abundance, survival, and recruitment. Multiple formulations of JS models have been developed and include both maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches. Bayesian approaches offer greater flexibility; however, they are often extremely slow when applied to moderate to large populations because the latent states of all observed individuals, as well as any potential unobserved individuals (parameter-expanded data augmentation), must be simulated at each time step.\nC_LIO_LIJS model implementations can be sped up dramatically through marginalization, whereby the conditional likelihoods of states are tracked for unique capture histories, rather than the simulated states of all individuals. Here we describe a marginalized implementation of a multistate JS model and compare its performance to that of an implementation using simulated discrete states. We fit models to data generated under two scenarios, one in which no data was missing and another in which 25% of data was randomly removed. To illustrate how marginalization can accommodate more complex models and datasets, we describe a modified version of the model for application to populations with transients and fit the model to simulated data and to data collected on Kentucky Warblers (Geothlypis formosa) as part of the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) program.\nC_LIO_LIBoth the discrete latent state and marginalized JS model implementations performed similarly with respect to bias and coverage; however, the marginalized implementation was roughly 1,000 times faster when no data were missing and 100 times faster when 25% of data was missing. The marginalized model accommodating transients also converged quickly and a more complex version of the model applied to the larger multi-site Kentucky Warbler data set yielded useful estimates of most parameters within a reasonable time frame (hours).\nC_LIO_LIGains in efficiency provided by marginalization shown here should stimulate additional study and development of this useful class of models and provide new opportunities for real-world applications to large complex data sets.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "It is nearly two decades ago that the  thin aggregative fimbriae which had been shown to enhance the biofilm formation of Salmonella enteriditis and Escherichia coli were identified as amyloid fibers. The realization that natural proteins can develop amyloidogenic traits as part of their functional repertoire instigated a search for similar proteins across all kingdoms of life. That pursuit has since unearthed dozens of candidates which now constitute the family of proteins referred to as functional amyloids (FA). FAs are promising candidates for future synthetic biology applications in that they marry the structural benefits of the amyloid fold (self-assembly and stability) while steering clear of the cytotoxicity issues that are typically linked to amyloid associated human pathologies. Unfortunately, the extreme aggregation propensity of FAs and the associated operational difficulties are restricting their adoption in real-world applications, underscoring the need for additional processes to control the amyloid reaction. Here we untangle the molecular mechanism of amyloid formation of the canonical functional amyloid curli using NMR, native mass spectrometry and cryo-electron microscopy. Our results are consistent with folding-limited one-step amyloid nucleation that has emerged as an evolutionary balance between efficient extracellular polymerization, while steering clear of pre-emptive nucleation in the periplasm. Sequence analysis of the amyloid curlin kernel suggests a finetuning of the rate of monomer folding via modulation of the secondary structure propensity of the pre-amyloid species, opening new potential avenues towards control of the amyloid reaction.",

    "abstract": "The Modern Evolutionary Synthesis seemingly fails to explain how a population can survive a large environmental change. That is, the pre-existence of heritable variants adapted to the novel environment is too opportunistic whereas the search for new adaptive mutations after the environmental change is too slow. Plasticity-led evolution, the process of initial environmental induction of a novel adaptive phenotype followed by genetic accommodation, has been proposed to solve this problem. However, the mechanism enabling plasticity-led evolution is unclear. Here, we propose computational models that exhibit behaviors compatible with plasticityled evolution by extending the Wagner model of gene regulatory networks. The models exhibit adaptive plastic response and uncovering of cryptic mutations under large environmental changes, followed by genetic accommodation. Moreover, these behaviors are consistently observed over distinct novel environments. We further show that environmental cues, developmental process, and hierarchical regulation cooperatively amplify the above behaviors and accelerate evolution. These observations suggest that plasticity-led evolution is a universal property of complex developmental regulation independent of particular mutations.",

    "abstract": "Maternal effects are an important source of phenotypic variation with potentially large fitness consequences, but how their importance varies with the quality of the environment across an individuals ontogeny is poorly understood. We bred Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) of known pedigree and experimentally manipulated the quality of offspring diet, to estimate the importance of prenatal maternal effects in shaping variation in body mass from hatching to adulthood. Maternal genetic effects on body mass at hatching were strong, and largely caused by variation in egg mass, but their importance rapidly declined with age. Whereas there was a large effect of diet on growth, this did not affect the decline of maternal effects variance. The importance of additive genetic and residual variance increased with age, with the latter being considerably larger in the poor diet treatment. Hence, we found no evidence for prenatal maternal effect by postnatal environment interactions, and that prenatal maternal effects are rapidly replaced by direct additive genetic and residual effects when offspring start to develop outside the egg. Thereby these results shed new light on the dynamics of the role of maternal versus offspring genes across ontogeny and environments.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian tRNA ligase complex (tRNA-LC) catalyzes the splicing of intron-containing pre-tRNAs in the nucleus and the splicing of XBP1 mRNA during the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the cytoplasm. We recently reported that the tRNA-LC co-evolved with PYROXD1, an essential oxidoreductase that protects the catalytic cysteine of RTCB, the catalytic subunit of the tRNA-LC, against aerobic oxidation. In this study we show that the oxidoreductase Thioredoxin (TRX) preserves the enzymatic activity of RTCB under otherwise inhibiting concentrations of oxidants. TRX physically interacts with oxidized RTCB, and reduces and re-activates RTCB through the action of its redox-active cysteine pair. We further show that TRX interacts with RTCB at late stages of UPR. Since the interaction requires oxidative conditions, our findings suggest that prolonged UPR generates reactive oxygen species. Thus, our results support a functional role for TRX in securing and repairing the active site of the tRNA-LC, thereby allowing pre-tRNA splicing and UPR to occur when cells encounter mild, but still inhibitory levels of reactive oxygen species.",

    "abstract": "The effect of the ionic liquids (ILs) 1-methyl-3-tetradecyl imidazolium chloride ([C14MIM][Cl]), 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C12MIM][Cl]) and 1-decyl-methylimidazolium chloride ([C10MIM][Cl]) on the structure of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopic, UV-Vis spectroscopy, small an-gle X-ray scattering and molecular dynamics simulations. Concerning the fluorescence measurements, we observed a blue shift and a fluorescence quenching as IL concen-tration increased in the solution. Such behavior was observed for all three studied imidazolium-based IL, being larger as the number of methylene groups in the alkyl chain grew. UV-Vis absorbance measurements indicate that even at relatively small IL:protein ratios, like 1:1, or 1:2 ([C14MIM][Cl]) is able to change, at least partially, the sample turbidity. SAXS results agree with the spectroscopic techniques and sug-gest that the proteins underwent a partial unfolding, evidenced by an increase in the radius of gyration (Rg) of the scattering particle. In the absence and presence of ([C14MIM][Cl])=3mM BSA Rg, increases from 29.1 to 45.1 [A], respectively. Together, these results indicate that the interaction of BSA with IL is divided into three stages: the first stage is characterized by the protein in its native form. It takes place for IL:protein[&le;] 1:2 and the interaction is predominantly due to the electrostatic forces, provided by the negative charges on the surface of the BSA and the cationic polar head of the ILs. In the second stage, higher IL concentrations induce the unfolding of the protein, most likely inducing the unfolding of domains I and III, in such a way that the proteins secondary structure is kept almost unaltered. In the last stage, IL micelles start to form and, therefore, interaction with protein reaches a saturation point and free micelles may be formed. We believe this work provides new information about the interaction of ILs with BSA.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=140 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/542168v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e28360org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f1fe0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@165b77forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f20500_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Plasmids are ubiquitous in biology, where they are used to study gene-function relationships and intricate molecular networks, and hold potential as therapeutic devices. Developing methods to control their function will advance their application in research and may also expedite their translation to clinical settings. Light is an attractive stimulus to conditionally regulate plasmid expression as it is non-invasive, and its properties such as wavelength, intensity, and duration can be adjusted to minimise cellular toxicity and increase penetration. Herein, we have developed a method to site-specifically introduce photocages into plasmids, by resynthesizing one strand in a manner similar to Kunkel mutagenesis. Unlike alternative approaches to chemically-modify plasmids, this method is sequence independent at the site of modification and uses commercially available phosphoramidites. To generate our light-activated (LA) plasmids, photocleavable biotinylated nucleobases were introduced at specific sites across the T7 and CMV promoters on plasmids and bound to streptavidin to sterically block access. These LA-plasmids were then successfully used to control expression in both cell-free systems (T7 promoter) and mammalian cells (CMV promoter). These light-activated plasmids might be used to remotely-control cellular activity and reduce off-target toxicity for future medical use. Our simple approach to plasmid modification might also be used to introduce novel chemical moieties for advanced function.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=50 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/542478v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (12K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@256978org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2f7ecdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2dd957org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1802bf_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Generalist microbes have adapted to a multitude of environmental stresses through their integrated stress response system. Individual stress responses have been quantified by E. coli metabolism and expression (ME) models under thermal, oxidative and acid stress, respectively. However, the systematic quantification of crosstalk among these stress responses remains lacking. Here, we present StressME: the unified stress response model of E. coli combining thermal (FoldME), oxidative (OxidizeME) and acid (AcidifyME) stress responses. StressME is the most up to date ME model for E. coli and it reproduces all published single-stress ME models. Additionally, it includes refined rate constants to improve prediction accuracy for wild-type and stress-evolved strains. StressME revealed certain optimal proteome allocation strategies associated with cross-stress responses. These stress-optimal proteomes were shaped by trade-offs between protective vs. metabolic enzymes; cytoplasmic vs. periplasmic chaperones; and expression of stress-specific proteins. As StressME is tuned to compute metabolic and gene expression responses under mild acid, oxidative, and thermal stresses, it is useful for engineering and health applications. The modular design of our open-source package also facilitates model expansion (e.g., to new stress mechanisms) by the computational biology community.\n\nAuthor summaryA fundamental understanding of multi-stress adaptation in E.coli has potential industrial relevance. While individual stress responses have been quantified through the protein regulatory network in E.coli, the systematic quantification of the crosstalk among stress responses remains lacking. Here, we develop a new modeling pipeline by which thermal, oxidative and acid stress response can be coupled to each other, and the metabolic activities, protein and metabolic flux redistribution due to cross stress can be quantified. We optimize the effective rate constants in the integrated model. We then confirm the model robustness by validating against the published data under single stress. Finally, we use the model to characterize the cross-adaptation between protective and catalytic proteins as well as between chaperones present in different cellular compartments. We find effective cross-protection against cross stress by adapting the E.coli cells to the thermal stress first. We also indicate the presence of trade-offs by which the cell may refuse to give up more protein allocation away from one stress response to the other, because doing so would decrease stress tolerance further. The single stress plug-in design makes the model build-up pipeline flexible and expandable, allowing incorporation of more stressors into the model architecture for industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "Arthropod-borne microbes rely on the metabolic state of a host to cycle between evolutionarily distant species. For instance, arthropod tolerance to infection may be due to redistribution of metabolic resources, often leading to microbial transmission to mammals. Conversely, metabolic alterations aids in pathogen elimination in humans, who do not ordinarily harbor arthropod-borne microbes. To ascertain the effect of metabolism on interspecies relationships, we engineered a system to evaluate glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in the tick Ixodes scapularis. Using a metabolic flux assay, we determined that the rickettsial bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum and the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, which are transstadially transmitted in nature, induced glycolysis in ticks. On the other hand, the endosymbiont Rickettsia buchneri, which is transovarially maintained, had a minimal effect on I. scapularis bioenergetics. Importantly, the metabolite {beta}-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) was elevated during A. phagocytophilum infection of tick cells following an unbiased metabolomics approach. Thus, we manipulated the expression of genes associated with the catabolism and anabolism of BAIBA in I. scapularis and detected impaired feeding on mammals, reduced bacterial acquisition, and decreased tick survival. Collectively, we reveal the importance of metabolism for tick-microbe relationships and unveil a valuable metabolite for I. scapularis fitness.",

    "abstract": "The bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei maintains essential mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}m) through the reverse activity of FoF1-ATP synthase. The ATP that drives this activity is thought to be generated by glycolysis and imported from the cytosol via an ATP/ADP carrier (AAC). We have shown that this carrier is the only carrier that can import ATP into the mitochondrial matrix to power the FoF1-ATPase. Contrary to expectations, its deletion has no effect on parasite growth, virulence and levels of {Delta}{Psi}m, suggesting that ATP is produced intramitochondrially by substrate phosphorylation pathways. Therefore, we knocked out the succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCoAS) gene, a key enzyme that produces ATP through substrate phosphorylation. Its absence resulted in changes in the metabolic landscape of the parasite, lower virulence, and reduced mitochondrial ATP content. This minimal mitochondrial ATP pool was maintained by AAC activity as evidenced by the 25- fold increase in sensitivity of the mutant parasites to AAC inhibitor carboxyatractyloside. Under nutrient-limited conditions, suppression of SCoAS expression by RNA interference negatively affected cell growth and levels of {Delta}{Psi}m. We concluded that the bloodstream mitochondrion is capable of generating ATP via substrate phosphorylation pathways, the importance of which depends on environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Metabolite exchange between plant roots and their associated rhizosphere microbiomes underpins plant growth promotion by microbes. Sorghum bicolor is a cereal crop that feeds animals and humans and is used for bioethanol production. Its root tips exude large amounts of a lipophilic benzoquinone called sorgoleone. Sorgoleone is an allelochemical that suppresses the growth of competing plant seedlings and is mineralized by microbes in soil. As an avenue to understand how sorghum and its root microbiome may be connected through root exudates, we identified the molecular determinants of microbial sorgoleone degradation and the distribution of this trait among microbes. We isolated and studied from sorghum-associated soils, three bacterial strains classified as Acinetobacter, Burkholderia, and Pseudomonas species that grow with sorgoleone as a sole carbon and energy source. The genomes of these strains were sequenced and subjected to transcriptomic and gene fitness analyses to identify candidate sorgoleone degradation genes. Follow up mutational analysis showed that sorgoleone catabolism is dependent on four contiguous genes that are conserved among the species we sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the sorgoleone degradation gene cluster showed that sorgoleone catabolism is enriched in sorghum-associated Streptomyces strains. The discovery of bacteria that grow on a compound like sorgoleone that is plant specific and not widely distributed in the environment, provides an opportunity to study how a plant exudate can enforce the development of a rhizosphere specific microbiome for the mutual benefit of plant and microbe.\n\nSignificanceThe grain crop sorghum exudes an herbicidal compound called sorgoleone from its root tips, which inhibits the growth of other plants. We isolated bacteria that grow on sorogleone and identified a cluster of bacterial genes required for sorogleone degradation that can be used as a biomarker for this trait. An approach to improve the production of crops in stressful conditions such as drought, is to encourage their association with plant growth promoting bacteria. Our discovery of sorgoleone degradation genes opens the door to engineering bacteria that receive benefit from sorghum in the form of a plant-specific growth substrate, and in return promote the growth of this crop.",

    "abstract": "During primary infection, varicella zoster virus (VZV) infects epithelial cells in the respiratory lymphoid organs and mucosa. Subsequent infection of lymphocytes, T cells in particular, causes primary viremia allowing systemic spread throughout the host, including the skin. This results in the expression of cytokines, including interferons (IFNs) which partly limit primary infection. VZV also spreads from skin keratinocytes to lymphocytes prior to secondary viremia. How VZV infects lymphocytes from epithelial cells while evading the cytokine response has not been fully established. Here, we show that VZV glycoprotein C (gC) binds IFN-{gamma} and modifies its activity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that gC in combination with IFN-{gamma} increased the expression of a small subset of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), including intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), as well as several chemokines and immunomodulatory genes. The higher ICAM1 protein level at the plasma membrane of epithelial cells resulted in lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1)-dependent T cell adhesion. This gC activity required a stable interaction with IFN-{gamma} and signalling through the IFN-{gamma} receptor. Finally, the presence of gC during infection increased VZV spread from epithelial cells to peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This constitutes the discovery of a novel strategy to modulate the activity of IFN-{gamma}, inducing the expression of a subset of ISGs, leading to enhanced T cell adhesion and virus spread.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry-based bottom-up proteomics is rapidly evolving and routinely applied in large biomedical studies. Proteases are a central component of every bottom-up proteomics experiment, digesting proteins into peptides. Trypsin has been the most widely applied protease in proteomics, due to its characteristics. With ever-larger cohort sizes and possible future clinical application of mass spectrometry-based proteomics, the technical impact of trypsin becomes increasingly relevant. To assess possible biases introduced by trypsin digestion, we evaluated the impact of eight commercially available trypsins in a variety of bottom-up proteomics experiments, and across a range of protease concentrations and storage times. To investigate the universal impact of these technical attributes, we included bulk HeLa-cell lysate, human plasma and single HEK293 cells, which were analyzed over a range of Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM), Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA), and Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) instrument methods on three LC-MS instruments. Quantification methods employed encompassed both label-free approaches and absolute quantification utilizing spike-in heavy-labeled recombinant protein fragment standards. Based on this extensive dataset, we report variations between commercial trypsins, their source, as well as their concentration. Furthermore, we provide suggestions on the handling of trypsin in large scale studies.",

    "abstract": "Blood flow regulates vascular function by generating wall shear stress which impacts endothelial cell (EC) physiology. Whilst high laminar shear stress (HSS) maintains the functional integrity of the vasculature, low oscillatory shear stress (LOSS) evokes secretion of pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory components from ECs, thus promoting the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory cargo are readily stored in endothelial-specific organelles termed Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs). WPBs form purely due to the multimerization of the pro-thrombotic glycoprotein von Willebrand factor (vWF). Here we investigated if aberrant shear stress, induced by non-uniform oscillatory flow, modulates the biogenesis of WPBs, and the subsequent release of vWF. Ultimately, we demonstrate, using an in vitro model, that LOSS has no effect on the level of vWF expression, however, LOSS promotes endothelial thrombotic potential by increasing WPB size, which impacts the length of the vWF strings that are released upon stimulation. Thus, wall shear stress can confer functional plasticity to WPBs by manipulating their biogenesis. Further understanding of the underlying mechanisms could aid generation of novel therapeutics in CVD.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome duplication (WGD) generates new genetic material that can contribute to the evolution of gene regulatory networks and phenotypes. After WGD, retained ohnologues can undergo subfunctionalisation to partition ancestral functions and/or neofunctionalisation, where one copy assumes a new function. We previously found that there had been a WGD in an ancestor of arachnopulmonates, the lineage including spiders and scorpions but excluding other arachnids like mites, ticks, and harvestmen. This WGD was evidenced by many duplicated homeobox genes, including two Hox clusters, in spiders. However, it was unclear which homeobox paralogues were produced by WGD versus tandem duplications. Understanding this is key to determining the relative contributions of tandem duplications and WGD to arachnopulmonate genome evolution. Here we characterised the distribution of duplicated homeobox genes across eight chromosome-level spider genomes. We found that the majority of retained duplicate homeobox genes in spiders likely originated from WGD. We also found two copies of conserved homeobox gene clusters, including the Hox, NK, HRO, Irx, and SINE, in all eight species. Consistently, we noticed one degenerated copy of each cluster in terms of gene content and organisation while the other remained more intact. Focussing on the NK cluster, we found evidence for regulatory subfunctionalisation between the duplicated NK genes in the spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum to their single-copy orthologues in the harvestman Phalangium opilio. Our study provides new insights into the contributions of multiple modes of duplication to the homeobox gene repertoire during the evolution of spiders and the function of NK genes.",

    "abstract": "Background: Restorative regeneration, the capacity to reform a lost body part following amputation or injury, is an important and still poorly understood process in animals. Annelids, or segmented worms, show amazing regenerative capabilities, and as such are a crucial group to investigate. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms that underpin regeneration in this major group remains a key goal. Among annelids, the nereididae Platynereis dumerilii (re)emerged recently as a front-line regeneration model. Following amputation of its posterior part, Platynereis worms can regenerate both differentiated tissues of their terminal part as well as a growth zone that contains putative stem cells. While this regeneration process follows specific and reproducible stages that have been well characterized, the transcriptomic landscape of these stages remains to be uncovered.\n\nResults: We generated a high quality de novo Reference transcriptome for the annelid Platynereis dumerilii. To do so, we produced and analyzed three RNA-sequencing datasets, encompassing five stages of posterior regeneration, along with blastema stages and non-amputated tissues as controls. We included these regeneration RNA-seq datasets, as well as embryonic and tissue-specific datasets from the literature to produce a Reference transcriptome. We used this Reference transcriptome to perform in depth analyzes of RNA-seq data during the course of regeneration to reveal the important dynamics of the gene expression, process with thousands of genes differentially expressed between stages, as well as unique and specific genes expression at each regeneration stage. The study of these genes highlighted the importance of the nervous system at both early and late stages of regeneration, as well as the enrichment of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) during almost the entire regeneration process.\n\nConclusions: In this study, we provided a high-quality de novo Reference transcriptome for the annelid Platynereis that is useful for investigating various developmental processes, including regeneration. Our extensive stage-specific transcriptional analysis during the course of posterior regeneration shed light upon major molecular mechanisms and pathways, and will foster many specific studies in the future.",

TCRs contain a record of an individuals past immune activities, and some TCRs are observed only in individuals with certain HLA alleles.

To this end, we propose a neural network method named Deep learning Prediction of TCR-HLA association (DePTH) to predict TCR-HLA associations based on their amino acid sequences.

The U-shaped bend traps foreign DNA on one face of the Cas1-2/3 integrase, while the loop places the first CRISPR repeat in the Cas1 active site. Both Cas3s rotate 100-degrees to expose DNA binding sites on either side of the Cas2 homodimer, that each bind an inverted repeat motif in the leader.

    "abstract": "We show that the flagellar beat of bull spermatozoa and Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii can be modelled by a minimal, geometrically nonlinear, sliding-controlled, reaction-diffusion system. Model solutions are spatio-temporally animated patterns describing flagellar bending waves, further connecting beating patterns of cilia and flagella with, seemly unrelated, chemical patterns from classical reaction-diffusion systems. Instead of chemical species freely reacting and diffusing in space, our system describes the tug-of-war reaction-kinetics of molecular motors that are anchored in the flagellar structure, but the shear deformation that they generate can diffuse away via the bending elasticity of the flagellum. Synchronization of the reaction-kinetics in neighbouring elements occurs via a sliding-control mechanism. We derive from first principles the reaction-diffusion basis of animated patterns, and show that this is a direct consequence of the high internal energy dissipation by the flagellum relative to the external dissipation by the fluid environment. By fitting, for the first time, nonlinear, large-amplitude solutions of a specific motor cross-bridge reaction-kinetics, we show that reaction-diffusion successfully accounts for beating patterns of both bull sperm and Chlamydomonas (wild-type and mbo2-mutant), unifying these distant eukaryotic species under the same minimal model. Our results suggest that the flagellar beat occurs far from equilibrium, in the strongly nonlinear regime, and that in contrary to the conclusions of small amplitude studies, a unified mechanism may exist for dynein molecular motor control that is regulated by axonemal sliding, without requiring curvature-sensing or the fine-tuning of basal compliance, and only weakly influenced by hydrodynamic dissipation and the cell body boundary condition. High internal dissipation allows the emergence of base-to-tip autonomous travelling waves, independently of, and without relying on, the external fluid viscosity, when small. This enables progressive swimming, otherwise not possible, in low viscosity environments, and may be critical for external fertilizers and aquatic microorganisms. The reaction-diffusion model may prove a powerful tool for studying the pattern formation of movement in flagella, cilia, and more generally, oscillations of animated filament-bundles at the microscale.",

N is comprised of two folded domains that are separated by a highly conserved, disordered, Ser/Arg-rich linker, and flanked by disordered tails. Using NMR spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation we identify an alpha-helical region in the linker that undergoes concentration dependent self-association. NMR and gel shift assays show that the linker binds viral RNA but this binding is dampened by both phosphorylation and a naturally occurring mutation, whereas in contrast, RNA binding to the full-length protein is not affected. Interestingly, phase separation with RNA is significantly reduced upon phosphorylation but enhanced with the mutation. We attribute these differences to changes in the linker helix self-association which dissociates upon phosphorylation but forms more stable higher order oligomers in the variant. These data provide a structural mechanism for how the linker region contributes to protein-protein interactions, RNA-protein interactions, liquid-liquid phase separation and N protein regulation.",

    "abstract": "The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) is a membrane transporter that creates and maintains intracellular Ca2+ stores. In the heart, SERCA is regulated by an inhibitory interaction with the monomeric form of the transmembrane micropeptide phospholamban (PLB). PLB also forms avid homo-pentamers, and dynamic exchange of PLB between pentamers and the regulatory complex with SERCA is an important determinant of cardiac responsiveness to exercise. Here, we investigated two naturally occurring pathogenic mutations of PLB, a cysteine substitution of arginine 9 (R9C) and an in-frame deletion of arginine 14 (R14del). Both mutations are associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. We previously showed that the R9C mutation causes disulfide crosslinking and hyperstabilization of pentamers. While the pathogenic mechanism of R14del is unclear, we hypothesized that this mutation may also alter PLB homo-oligomerization and disrupt the PLB-SERCA regulatory interaction. SDS-PAGE revealed a significantly increased pentamer:monomer ratio for R14del-PLB when compared to WT-PLB. In addition, we quantified homo-oligomerization and SERCA-binding in live cells using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy. R14del-PLB showed an increased affinity for homo-oligomerization and decreased binding affinity for SERCA compared to WT, suggesting that, like R9C, the R14del mutation stabilizes PLB in its pentameric form, decreasing its ability to regulate SERCA. Moreover, the R14del mutation reduces the rate of PLB unbinding from the pentamer after a transient Ca2+ elevation, limiting the rate of re-binding to SERCA. A computational model predicted that hyperstabilization of PLB pentamers by R14del impairs the ability of cardiac Ca2+ handling to respond to changing heart rates between rest and exercise. We postulate that impaired responsiveness to physiological stress contributes to arrhythmogenesis in human carriers of the R14del mutation.",

One of those traits is a genetic XX/XY sex-determination system, which ensures an equal distribution of both sexes. Comparisons of female and male genomic sequences identified the Y-chromosomal copy of the TGF-{beta} family member gdf6 as the candidate male sex-determining (SD) gene, which was named gdf6Y in contrast to the X-chromosomal allele gdf6X. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated inactivation of gdf6Y in N. furzeri led to a complete male-to-female sex reversal in XY animals. The homozygous inactivation of gdf6X on the other hand led to a detrimental phenotype post-hatching. This phenotype was compensated by gdf6Y, revealing that the latter became the SD gene while retaining at least some of its original gdf6 function. Gdf6Y is expressed in testicular somatic cells already prior to hatching, where it represses the germ cell-intrinsic feminizing gene foxl2l. We have identified components of the TGF-{beta} signaling pathway, especially the inhibitor of DNA binding genes id1/2/3, and the mRNA decay activator zfp36l2, as Gdf6Y targets. We conclude that Gdf6Y exerts its function as the male sex-determining gene by suppressing female-specific genes in the developing gonad of male N. furzeri.",

    "abstract": "DNA base pairs can both encode biological information and be used as a programmable material to build nanostructures with potential application in nanofabrication, data processing and storage, biosensing and drug delivery. Over several decades development of these DNA origami nanostructures has led to increasingly advanced self-assembling nanostructures and molecular machines actuated by various mechanisms such as toehold-mediated strand displacement (TMSD), magnetism and even light. However, scalability remains challenging as using larger scaffold strands can increase the likelihood of kinetic traps and misfolded conformations. Here we describe a repeatable DNA nanohinge system to increase the scalability of existing nanohinge designs for hierarchical assembly of more complex structures with greater degrees of mobility and functionality. The components of this system, comprising two distinct nanohinges, were designed in caDNAno. Structure conformation and stability were simulated using CanDo and MrDNA, and hinge assembly was validated by TEM. Electron micrographs revealed hinge-shaped nanostructures capable of self-assembly into more complex structures, as well as actuation using TMSD through a reversible locking mechanism incorporated into the design. Our work expands the existing utility of DNA nanohinges as building blocks for scalable DNA nanostructures and demonstrates the feasibility of polymerizing hinges in a novel manner for higher order assembly. The enhanced functionality of our dual hinge systems can be employed in future applications requiring greater control and mobility of DNA nanostructures.",

    "abstract": "Precision gene editing in primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) would facilitate both curative treatments for monogenic disorders as well as disease modelling. Precise efficiencies even with the CRISPR/Cas system, however, remain limited. Through an optimization of guide RNA delivery, donor design, and additives, we have now obtained mean precise editing efficiencies >90% on primary cord blood HSCPs with minimal toxicity and without observed off-target editing. The main protocol modifications needed to achieve such high efficiencies were the addition of the DNA-PK inhibitor AZD7648, and the inclusion of spacer-breaking silent mutations in the donor in addition to mutations disrupting the PAM sequence. Critically, editing was even across the progenitor hierarchy, and did not substantially distort the hierarchy or affect lineage outputs in colony-forming cell assays. As modelling of many diseases requires heterozygosity, we also demonstrated that the overall editing and zygosity can be tuned by adding in defined mixtures of mutant and wild-type donor. With these optimizations, editing at near-perfect efficiency can now be accomplished directly in human HSPCs. This will open new avenues in both therapeutic strategies and disease modelling.",

    "abstract": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) allows to visualize the cellular context at macromolecular level. To date, the impossibility of obtaining a reliable ground truth is limiting the application of deep learning-based image processing algorithms in this field. As a consequence, there is a growing demand of realistic synthetic datasets for training deep learning algorithms. In addition, besides assisting the acquisition and interpretation of experimental data, synthetic tomograms are used as reference models for cellular organization analysis from cellular tomograms. Current simulators in cryo-ET focus on reproducing distortions from image acquisition and tomogram reconstruction, however they cannot generate many of the low order features present in cellular tomograms.\n\nHere we propose several geometric and organization models to simulate low order cellular structures imaged by cryo-ET. Specifically, clusters of any known cytosolic or membrane-bound macromolecules, membranes with different geometries as well as different filamentous structures such as microtubules or actin networks. Moreover, we use parametrizable stochastic models to generate a high diversity of geometries and organizations to simulate representative and generalized datasets, including very crowded environments like those observed in native cells.\n\nThese models have been implemented in a multiplatform open-source Python package, including scripts to generate cryo-tomograms with adjustable sizes and resolutions. In addition, these scripts also provide distortion free density maps besides the ground truth in different file formats for an efficient access and advanced visualization. We show that such a realistic synthetic dataset can be used to train generalizable deep learning algorithms.",

How viruses sense lipid compositions to target suitable host cells is poorly understood. Using multi-scale molecular simulations, we computed 66 membrane binding free energies of fusion proteins from classes I-III with various lipid compositions and identified distinct mechanisms of lipid recognition. We find that membrane binding of class II and III proteins, but not of class I proteins, is greatly modulated by the content of polyunsaturated lipids, cholesterol, anionic lipids, or gangliosides. Fusion proteins bind specific membranes by chemically recognizing distinct head group moieties and by sensing packing defects. The results show that lipid recognition of class II and III fusion proteins is a key feature to selectively bind to mammalian plasma membranes or to membranes of the endosomal compartments.",

We perform our method on Cre recombinase with optogenetic dimers as a proof of concept, resulting in comprehensive data on split sites throughout the protein.

Expression of STING is tightly regulated and commonly reduced or defective in many types of cancer. We have identified SIX4 as a significant regulator of STING expression in colon cancer cells. We showed that knockout of SIX4 decreased STING expression at the mRNA and protein levels while ectopic expression of SIX4 increased STING expression. Depletion of SIX4 led to attenuated STING activation and downstream signaling. Re-expression of SIX4 or ectopic expression of STING in SIX4 knockout cells reversed the effect. Ectopic expression of SIX4 enhanced DMXAA and cGAMP-induced STING activation and downstream signaling. Importantly, decrease of SIX4 expression substantially decreased tumor infiltration of CD8+ T-cells and reduced the efficacy of PD-1 antibodies to diminish tumor growth in immune competent mice in vivo. Finally, analysis of TCGA colon cancer dataset indicated that tumors with high SIX4 expression were significantly enriched in the Inflammatory Response pathway. SIX4 expression also correlated with expression of multiple IFN-stimulated genes, inflammatory cytokines and CD8A. Taken together, our results implicate that SIX4 is a principal regulator of STING expression in colon cancer cells, providing an additional mechanism and genetic marker to predict effective immune checkpoint blockade therapy responses.",

    "abstract": "Transcription regulates key functions of living organisms in normal and disease states, including cell growth and development, embryonic and adult tissue organization, and tumor progression. Here we identify a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation by an actin regulatory and signaling protein, Abelson Interactor 1 (ABI1). Using prostate cancer models, we uncover a reciprocal regulation between ABI1 and the Androgen Receptor (AR). ABI1 is a direct, androgen-regulated target; in turn, ABI1 interacts with AR and its splice variant ARv7, and co-regulates a subset of specific transcriptional targets. ABI1 directs transcription through transient yet well-defined interaction of its intrinsically disordered region with DNA. Clinical evaluation shows that the ABI1-DNA binding (through Exon 4 splicing) and ABI1-AR interaction are regulated during androgen deprivation therapy and prostate cancer progression, thus controlling tumor plasticity through connecting actin cytoskeleton and cellular signaling to transcriptional regulation. We propose ABI1 as epigenetic regulator of transcriptional homeostasis in AR-driven cancers.\n\nStatement of importanceThis study describes fundamental discovery in prostate cancer identifying novel mechanism of transcription by unique DNA binding mechanism involving actin cytoskeleton regulatory protein ABI1. ABI1-DNA binding activity predicts survival of prostate cancer patients.

Recently, membrane thickness variation due to membrane compositional changes have been shown to drive IRE1 cluster formation, activating the UPR even in the absence of proteotoxic stress.

    "abstract": "In tandem with the expanding obesity pandemic, the prevalence of metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH, formerly known as NASH)-driven hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is predicted to rise globally, creating a significant need for therapeutic interventions. We previously identified the upregulation of apoptosis antagonizing transcription factor (AATF), which is implicated in facilitating the progression from MASH to HCC. The objective of this study was to examine whether the intervention of curcumin could alleviate AATF-mediated MASH, inhibit tumor growth, and elucidate the underlying mechanism. A preclinical murine model mimicking human MASH-HCC was employed, subjecting mice to either a chow diet normal water (CDNW) or western diet sugar water (WDSW) along with very low dose of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4-0.2 l/g, weekly). Mice receiving curcumin (CUR) alongside WDSW/CCl4 exhibited significant improvements, including reduced liver enzymes, dyslipidemia, steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning. Curcumin treatment also suppressed hepatic expression of inflammatory, fibrogenic, and oncogenic markers. Of note, there was a significant reduction in the expression of AATF upon curcumin treatment in WDSW/CCl4 mice and human HCC cells. In contrast, curcumin upregulated Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) in MASH liver and HCC cells, which is known to downregulate sp1 (specificity protein-1) expression. Thus, curcumin treatment effectively inhibited the progression of MASH to HCC by downregulating the expression of AATF via the KLF4-Sp1 signaling pathway. These preclinical findings establish a novel molecular connection between curcumin and AATF in reducing hepatocarcinogenesis, and provide a strong rationale for the development of curcumin as a viable treatment for MASH-HCC in humans.",

Here we present an approach for expressing multiple open reading frames (ORFs) from a single transcript, taking advantage of the leaky scanning model of translation initiation. In this method, adjacent ORFs are translated from a single messenger RNA at tunable ratios determined by their order in the sequence and the strength of their translation initiation sites. We call this approach Stoichiometric Expression of Messenger Polycistrons by Eukaryotic Ribosomes (SEMPER). We demonstrate the principles of this approach by expressing up to three fluorescent proteins from one plasmid in two different cell lines. We then use it to encode a stoichiometrically tuned polycistronic construct encoding gas vesicle acoustic reporter genes, showing that enforcing the optimal ratio in every cell enables efficient formation of the multi-protein complex while minimizing cellular toxicity. Finally, we demonstrate the polycistronic expression of two fluorescent proteins from single mRNAs made through in vitro transcription and delivered to cells.

    "abstract": "Thalamocortical (TC) neurons within the ventrolateral thalamus (VL) receive projections from the cerebellum and the basal ganglia (BG) to facilitate motor and non-motor functions. Tonic and rebound firing patterns in response to excitatory cerebellar and inhibitory BG inputs, respectively, are a canonical feature of TC neurons and plays a key role in signal processing. The intrinsic excitability of TC neurons has a strong influence on how they respond to synaptic inputs, however, it is unknown whether their afferents influence their firing properties. Understanding the input-specific firing patterns could shed light into movement disorders with cerebellar or BG involvement. Here, we used whole-cell electrophysiology in brain slices from C57BL/6 mice to investigate the firing of TC neurons with optogenetic confirmation of cerebellar or BG afferents. TC neurons with cerebellar afferents exhibited higher tonic and rebound firing rates than those with BG afferents. This increased firing was associated with faster action potential depolarization kinetics and a smaller afterhyperpolarization potential. We also found differences in the passive membrane properties and sag currents during hyperpolarization. Despite higher rebound firing in TC neurons with cerebellar afferents, there were no differences in T-type calcium channel function compared to those with BG inputs. These data suggest input-specific differences in sodium and SK, but not T-type calcium channels, impact firing properties in TC populations. Altogether, we showed that the pronounced divergence observed in TC neuron firing properties correlate with its heterogeneous anatomical connectivity, which could signify a distinct signal integration and processing by these neurons.",

Using a task where monkeys made sequential, varied arm movements, we show that independent parameters of arm movements are independently encoded in the low-dimensional trajectories of population activity: each movements direction by a fixed neural trajectory and its urgency by how quickly that trajectory was traversed. Network models show this latent coding allows the direction and urgency of arm movement to be independently controlled. Our results support a key prediction of the dynamical systems view of motor cortex, but also argue that not all parameters of movement are defined by the initial conditions of those dynamics.",

This approach allows for single-synapse resolution maps of plasticity in genetically targeted neurons during memory formation.

    "abstract": "The cholinergic innervation of the cortex originates almost entirely from populations of neurons in the basal forebrain. Structurally, the ascending basal forebrain cholinergic projections are highly branched, with individual cells targeting multiple different cortical regions. However, it is not known whether the structural organization of basal forebrain projections reflects their functional integration with the cortex. We therefore used high resolution 7T diffusion and resting state functional MRI in humans to examine multimodal gradients of forebrain cholinergic connectivity with the neocortex.\n\nMoving from anteromedial to posterolateral BF, structural and functional gradients became progressively detethered, with the most pronounced dissimilarity localized in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM). Structure-function tethering was shaped in part by the distance of cortical parcels from the BF and their myelin content. Functional but not structural connectivity with the BF grew stronger at shorter geodesic distances, with weakly myelinated transmodal cortical areas most strongly expressing this divergence. We then used an in vivo cell type-specific marker of the presynaptic cholinergic nerve terminals, [18F] FEOBV PET, to demonstrate that the transmodal cortical areas exhibiting highest structure-function detethering with BF gradients are also among the most densely innervated by its cholinergic projections.\n\nAltogether, multimodal gradients of basal forebrain connectivity reveal inhomogeneity in structure-function tethering which becomes most pronounced in the transition from anteromedial to posterolateral BF. Cortical cholinergic projections emanating from the NbM in particular may exhibit a broad repertoire of connections with key transmodal cortical areas associated with the ventral attention network.",

High laminar shear stress also supports flow-aligned cell elongation and front-rear polarity, but whether this is required for athero-protective signaling is unclear. Here, we show that Caveolin-1-rich microdomains become polarized at the downstream end of ECs exposed to continuous high laminar flow. These microdomains are characterized by higher membrane rigidity, filamentous actin (F-actin) and lipid accumulation. Transient receptor potential vanilloid-type 4 (Trpv4) ion channels, while ubiquitously expressed, mediate localized Ca2+ entry at these microdomains where they physically interact with clustered Caveolin-1. The resultant focal bursts in Ca2+ activate the anti-inflammatory factor endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) within the confines of these domains. Importantly, we find that signaling at these domains requires both cell body elongation and sustained flow. Finally, Trpv4 signaling at these domains is necessary and sufficient to suppress inflammatory gene expression. Our work reveals a novel polarized mechanosensitive signaling hub that induces an anti-inflammatory response in arterial ECs exposed to high laminar shear stress.",

    "abstract": "During C. elegans oocyte meiosis I, cortical actomyosin is locally remodeled to assemble a contractile ring near the spindle. In contrast to mitosis, when most cortical actomyosin converges into a contractile ring, the small oocyte ring forms within and remains part of a much larger and actively contractile cortical actomyosin network. This network both mediates contractile ring dynamics and generates shallow ingressions throughout the oocyte cortex during polar body extrusion. Based on our analysis of requirements for CLS-2, a member of the CLASP family of proteins that stabilize microtubules, we recently proposed that a balance of actomyosin-mediated tension and microtubule-mediated stiffness are required for contractile ring assembly within the oocyte cortical actomyosin network. Here, using live cell imaging and fluorescent protein fusions, we show that CLS-2 is part of a complex of kinetochore proteins, including the scaffold KNL-1 and the kinase BUB-1, that also co-localize to patches distributed throughout the oocyte cortex during meiosis I. By reducing their function, we further show that KNL-1 and BUB-1, like CLS-2, are required for cortical microtubule stability, to limit membrane ingression throughout the oocyte, and for meiotic contractile ring assembly and polar body extrusion. Moreover, nocodazole or taxol treatment to destabilize or stabilize oocyte microtubules, respectively, leads to excess or decreased membrane ingression throughout the oocyte and defective polar body extrusion. Finally, genetic backgrounds that elevate cortical microtubule levels suppress the excess membrane ingression in cls-2 mutant oocytes. These results support our hypothesis that CLS-2, as part of a sub-complex of kinetochore proteins that also co-localize to patches throughout the oocyte cortex, stabilizes microtubules to stiffen the oocyte cortex and limit membrane ingression throughout the oocyte, thereby facilitating contractile ring dynamics and the successful completion of polar body extrusion during meiosis I.",

    "abstract": "Motor function is a critical aspect of communication in a wide range of taxa. The transcription factor FoxP2 plays an important role in coordinating the development of motor areas related to vocal communication in humans, mice, and songbirds. However, the role of FoxP2 in regulating motor coordination of non-vocal communication behaviors in other vertebrate taxa is unclear. Here, we test the hypothesis that FoxP2 is associated with begging behavior in tadpoles of the Mimetic poison frog (Ranitomeya imitator). In this species, mothers provide unfertilized egg meals to tadpoles that perform a begging display to communicate hunger by vigorously dancing back and forth. We mapped the neural distribution of FoxP2-positive neurons in the tadpole brain, where its wide distribution paralleled that of mammals, birds, and fishes. We next evaluated the activity of FoxP2-positive neurons during tadpole begging and found that FoxP2-positive neurons showed increased activation in the striatum, preoptic area and cerebellum. Overall, this work suggests a generalizable function of FoxP2 in social communication across terrestrial vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic dynein is the primary motor that drives the motility and force generation functions towards the microtubule minus end. The activation of dynein motility requires its assembly with dynactin and a cargo adaptor. This process is facilitated by two dynein-associated factors, Lis1 and Nde1/Ndel1. Recent studies proposed that Lis1 rescues dynein from its autoinhibited conformation, but the physiological function of Nde1/Ndel1 remains elusive. Here, we investigated how human Nde1 and Lis1 regulate the assembly and subsequent motility of the mammalian dynein/dynactin complex using in vitro reconstitution and single molecule imaging. We found that Nde1 promotes the assembly of active dynein complexes by competing with the inhibitor of Lis1, PAFAH-2, and recruiting Lis1 to dynein. However, excess Nde1 inhibits dynein, presumably by competing against dynactin to bind the dynein intermediate chain. The association of dynactin with dynein triggers Nde1 dissociation before the initiation of dynein motility. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for how Nde1 and Lis1 synergistically activate the dynein transport machinery.",

    "abstract": "Glioma is one of the most aggressive human cancers with limited therapeutic options. Though research has extensively examined immune components in those malignant tumors, the pathophysiological mechanism establishing their immunosuppressive microenvironment remains incompletely characterized. In this study, we report for the first time the unique presence of tumor-specific neutrophils (TSNs) in human glioblastoma (GBM) tumors. This newly defined neutrophil subtype exhibits the high expression of several immunosuppressive genes (e.g., CD274 and IDO1) and is strongly correlated with glioma grades and poor prognosis of patients. TSNs with comparable gene signatures are similarly present in the tumors but not bone marrow or spleen of mouse glioma models. Blockage of TSN recruitment by either Cxcl1-knockout in glioma cells or Cxcr2-deletion in host mice significantly enhances antitumor immunity and inhibits tumor progression. Surprisingly, we further discover the meninges as the key extratumoral source of generating TSNs in both human GBM patients and mouse glioma models. These results have therefore elucidated a novel mechanism designating the tumor microenvironment of gliomas and its essential link to meningeal immunity.",

    "abstract": "The NRAS-mutant subset of melanoma represents the most aggressive and the deadliest types associated with poorer overall survival. Unfortunately, for more than 40 years, no therapeutic agent directly targeting NRAS mutations have been clinically approved yet. Herein, based on microsecond scale molecular dynamics simulations, the concept of NRAS-Q61 mutation classification was firstly proposed. NRAS Q61 positively charged mutations (Q61R and Q61K) was classified together, with a specific targetable pocket, while NRAS-Q61L classified into another category. Moreover, the isomer-sourced structure iteration (ISSI) method was developed for the in silico design of potential inhibitors (HM-516) targeting NRAS mutations. Overall, through this article, we hope to provide the academic and clinical community with new perspective and understanding of NRAS oncoproteins, and propose possible solution to this challenge.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant alternative splicing can generate neoantigens, which can themselves stimulate immune responses and surveillance. Previous methods for quantifying splicing-derived neoantigens are limited by independent references and potential batch effects. Here, we introduce SpliceMutr, a bioinformatics approach and pipeline for identifying splicing derived neoantigens from paired tumor normal data. SpliceMutr facilitates the identification of tumor-specific antigenic splice variants, predicts MHC-binding affinity, and estimates splicing antigenicity scores per gene. By applying this tool to genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we generate splicing-derived neoantigens and neoantigenicity scores per sample and across all cancer types and find numerous correlations between splicing antigenicity and well-established biomarkers of anti-tumor immunity. Notably, carriers of mutations within splicing machinery genes have higher splicing antigenicity, which provides support for our approach. Further analysis of splicing antigenicity in cohorts of melanoma patients treated with mono- or combined immune checkpoint inhibition suggest that the abundance of splicing antigens is reduced post-treatment from baseline in patients who progress, likely because of an immunoediting process. We also observe increased splicing antigenicity in responders to immunotherapy, which may relate to an increased capacity to mount an immune response to splicing-derived antigens. This new computational tool provides novel analytical capabilities for splicing antigenicity and is openly available for further immuno-oncologic analysis.",

    "abstract": "Glioma is the most common malignancy in the skull, accounting for approximately 2% of adult systemic tumors. It is characterized by a high recurrence rate, high disability rate, and poor sensitivity to chemotherapy. Different subtypes of glioma exhibit varying prognosis and chemotherapy sensitivities. Currently, researchers extensively study the molecular classification of glioma based on transcriptomic features, facilitating the evaluation of prognosis. However, identification of tumor subtypes based on the single-layer-omics data have several limitations. In this regard, the present study aimed to identify new subtypes of glioma using three omics datasets for prognosis prediction. As a result, cluster A subtype was identified to be associated with lower activation of cell proliferation and better prognosis, while cluster B subtype exhibited higher infiltration of M2-type macrophages and higher activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway, potentially leading to a poorer prognosis. Furthermore, we employed the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) algorithm and limma R package to identify driver genes for clusters A and B. Consequently, nine genes were identified as gene signatures for cluster A. Based on this finding, we quantified the two subtypes using the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm, where a higher score were linked to elevated tumor mutation burden (TMD) and signaling pathways related to cell proliferation. Low scores indicated enrichment of tumorigenesis-related pathways and poor prognosis. In silico drug screening suggested that AGI-6780 could be an effective compound for high cluster subtypes, based on brain tumor cell lines. Consequently, our study determined that the score can serve as an effective index to predict the prognosis of glioma.",

    "abstract": "Sarcomas are a family of rare malignancies composed of over 100 distinct histological subtypes. The rarity of sarcoma poses significant challenges in conducting clinical trials to identify effective therapies, to the point that many rarer subtypes of sarcoma do not have standard-of-care treatment. Even for established regimens, there can be substantial heterogeneity in responses. Overall, novel, personalized approaches for identifying effective treatments are needed to improve patient out-comes. Patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) are clinically relevant models representative of the physiological behavior of tumors across an array of malignancies. Here, we use PDTOs as a tool to better understand the biology of individual tumors and characterize the landscape of drug resistance and sensitivity in sarcoma. We collected n=194 specimens from n=126 sarcoma patients, spanning 24 distinct subtypes. We characterized PDTOs established from over 120 biopsy, resection, and metastasectomy samples. We leveraged our organoid high-throughput drug screening pipeline to test the efficacy of chemotherapeutics, targeted agents, and combination therapies, with results available within a week from tissue collection. Sarcoma PDTOs showed patient-specific growth characteristics and subtype-specific histopathology. Organoid sensitivity correlated with diagnostic subtype, patient age at diagnosis, lesion type, prior treatment history, and disease trajectory for a subset of the compounds screened. We found 90 biological pathways that were implicated in response to treatment of bone and soft tissue sarcoma organoids. By comparing functional responses of organoids and genetic features of the tumors, we show how PDTO drug screening can provide an orthogonal set of information to facilitate optimal drug selection, avoid ineffective therapies, and mirror patient outcomes in sarcoma. In aggregate, we were able to identify at least one effective FDA-approved or NCCN-recommended regimen for 59% of the specimens tested, providing an estimate of the proportion of immediately actionable information identified through our pipeline.\n\nHighlightsO_LIStandardized organoid culture preserve unique sarcoma histopathological features\nC_LIO_LIDrug screening on patient-derived sarcoma organoids provides sensitivity information that correlates with clinical features and yields actionable information for treatment guidance\nC_LIO_LIHigh-throughput screenings provide orthogonal information to genetic sequencing\nC_LIO_LISarcoma organoid response to treatment correlates with patient response to therapy\nC_LIO_LILarge scale, functional precision medicine programs for rare cancers are feasible within a single institution\nC_LI",
