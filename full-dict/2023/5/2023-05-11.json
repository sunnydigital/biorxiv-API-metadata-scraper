    "abstract": "The rickettsial human pathogen Orientia tsutsugamushi (Ot) is an obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium with one of the most highly fragmented and repetitive genomes of any organism. Around 50% of its [~]2.3 Mb genome is comprised of repetitive DNA that is derived from the highly proliferated Rickettsiales amplified genetic element (RAGE). RAGE is an integrative and conjugative element (ICE) that is present in a single Ot genome in up to 92 copies, most of which are partially or heavily degraded. In this report, we analysed RAGEs in eight fully sequenced Ot genomes and manually curated and reannotated all RAGE-associated genes, including those encoding DNA mobilisation proteins, P-type (vir) and F-type (tra) type IV secretion system (T4SS) components, Ankyrin repeat- and tetratricopeptide repeat-containing effectors, and other piggybacking cargo. Originally, the heavily degraded Ot RAGEs led to speculation that they are remnants of historical ICEs that are no longer active. Our analysis, however, identified two Ot genomes harbouring one or more intact RAGEs with complete F-T4SS genes essential for mediating ICE DNA transfer. As similar ICEs have been identified in unrelated rickettsial species, we assert that RAGEs play an ongoing role in lateral gene transfer within the Rickettsiales. Remarkably, we also identified in several Ot genomes remnants of prophages with no similarity to other rickettsial prophages. Together these findings indicate that, despite their obligate intracellular lifestyle and host range restricted to mites, rodents and humans, Ot genomes are highly dynamic and shaped through ongoing invasions by mobile genetic elements and viruses.",

    "abstract": "RNA-DNA hybrids are epigenetic features of all genomes that intersect with many processes, including transcription, telomere homeostasis and centromere function. Increasing evidence suggests RNA-DNA hybrids can provide two conflicting roles in the maintenance and transmission of genomes: they can be the triggers of DNA damage, leading to genome change, or can aid the DNA repair processes needed to respond to DNA lesions. Evasion of host immunity by African trypanosomes, such as Trypanosoma brucei, relies on targeted recombination of silent Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) genes into a specialised telomeric locus that directs transcription of just one VSG from thousands. How such VSG recombination is targeted and initiated is unclear. Here, we show that a key enzyme of T. brucei homologous recombination, RAD51, interacts with RNA-DNA hybrids. In addition, we show that RNA-DNA hybrids display a genome- wide co-localisation with DNA breaks, and that this relationship is impaired by mutation of RAD51. Finally, we show that RAD51 acts to repair highly abundant, localised DNA breaks at the single transcribed VSG, and that mutation of RAD51 alters RNA-DNA hybrid abundance both around the transcribed VSG and across the silent VSG archive. This work reveals a widespread, generalised role for RNA-DNA hybrids in directing RAD51 activity during recombination and uncovers a specialised application of this interplay during targeted DNA break repair needed for the critical T. brucei immune evasion reaction of antigenic variation.",

    "abstract": "Carbohydrates are chemically and structurally diverse, represent a substantial fraction of marine organic matter and are key substrates for heterotrophic microbes. Studies on carbohydrate utilisation by marine microbes have been centred on phytoplankton blooms in temperate regions, while far less is known from high-latitude waters and during later seasonal stages. Here, we combine glycan microarrays and analytical chromatography with metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to show the spatial heterogeneity in glycan distribution and their utilisation by microbes in Atlantic waters of the Arctic during late summer. The composition and abundance of monomers and glycan structures in POM varied with location and depth. Complex fucose-containing sulfated polysaccharides, known to accumulate in the ocean, were consistently detected, suggesting limited degradation by microbes. In contrast, the more labile {beta}-1,3-glucan exhibited a patchy distribution, indicating local variations in primary productivity and rapid utilisation. Metatranscriptomics showed active and dynamic microbial populations that targeted specific glycans. Gene transcription of carbohydrate-active enzymes revealed narrow substrate niches for specialists, involving compounds such as -mannans and alginate, along with the targeting of communal substrates, such as laminarin, by multiple populations. The observed spatial heterogeneity indicates that local biological and physical processes continue to shape the carbohydrate pool during late summer in high latitude waters and microbial populations are active and responsive to such changes.",

    "abstract": "Many pathogenic bacteria, including Legionella pneumophila, infect humans from environmental reservoirs. To survive in these reservoirs, bacteria must withstand microbe-on-microbe competition. We previously discovered that L. pneumophila can compete with neighboring bacteria via an antimicrobial metabolite called homogentisic acid (HGA) (Levin, Goldspiel, and Malik 2019). Curiously, L. pneumophila strains that secrete HGA are not wholly immune to its effects: low-density bacteria are strongly inhibited by HGA whereas high-density cells are tolerant. How do these bacteria tolerate HGA and avoid self-harm during interbacterial competition? Here, we find that HGA toxicity occurs via the production of toxic hydroperoxides and multiple factors facilitate high-density tolerance. First, HGA only becomes fully toxic after >1 hour of oxidation. While this manifests as a delay in killing within well-mixed liquid cultures, in a biofilm environment, this could provide time for HGA to diffuse away before becoming toxic. Second, HGA generates quantities of hydroperoxides that can be collectively scavenged by high-density, but not low-density cells. And third, high-density cells produce one or more secreted factors that are transiently protective from HGA. In combination, we propose that the bacteria are able to deploy HGA to generate a pool of reactive oxygen species surrounding their own biofilms, while maintaining non-toxic conditions within them. Overall, these findings help to explain how broadly toxic molecules can be used as inter-bacterial weapons. They also provide insights about why some of our current decontamination methods to control L. pneumophila are ineffective, leading to recurrent disease outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein has 22 potential N-linked glycosylation sites per monomer that are highly conserved among diverse variants, but how individual glycans affect virus entry and neutralization of Omicron variants has not been extensively characterized. Here we compared the effects of specific glycan deletions or modifications in the Omicron BA.1 and D614G spikes on spike expression, processing, and incorporation into pseudoviruses, as well as on virus infectivity and neutralization by therapeutic antibodies. We found that loss of potential glycans at spike residues N717 and N801 each conferred a loss of pseudovirus infectivity for Omicron but not for D614G or Delta variants. This decrease in infectivity correlated with decreased spike processing and incorporation into Omicron pseudoviruses. Oligomannose-enriched Omicron pseudoviruses generated in GnTI- cells or in the presence of kifunensine were non-infectious, whereas D614G or Delta pseudoviruses generated under similar conditions remained infectious. Similarly, authentic SARS-CoV-2 grown in the presence of kifunensine decreased titers more for the BA.1.1 variant than Delta or D614G variants relative to their respective, untreated controls. Finally, we found that loss of some N-glycans, including N343 and N234, increased the maximum percent neutralization by the class 3 S309 monoclonal antibody against D614G but not BA.1 variants, while these glycan deletions altered the neutralization potency of the class 1 COV2-2196 and Etesevimab monoclonal antibodies without affecting maximum percent neutralization. The maximum neutralization by some antibodies also varied with the glycan composition, with oligomannose-enriched pseudoviruses conferring the highest percent neutralization. These results highlight differences in the interactions between spike glycans and residues among SARS-CoV-2 variants that can affect spike expression, virus infectivity, and susceptibility of variants to antibody neutralization.\n\nAuthor summary (non-technical)The SARS-CoV-2 spike surface protein is covered in glycans that may affect its function and ability to evade antibodies. Omicron variants have over 30 mutations compared to the D614G variant, yet all 22 potential N-glycosylation sites are highly conserved. Here we compared the impact of glycan changes in the spikes of the Omicron and D614G variants on virus infectivity and neutralization. We found that loss of specific glycans in the transmembrane subunit of spike greatly reduced Omicron, but not D614G, spike expression and incorporation into pseudoviruses. Changes in the overall glycan composition also reduced the infectivity of Omicron pseudovirus and authentic virus more than D614G pseudoviruses and authentic viruses. We further show that changes in specific glycans directly or indirectly affected susceptibility of pseudoviruses to therapeutic antibodies, but the effects differed among the variants. These findings highlight differences in the interplay between spike glycans and amino acid residues among SARS-CoV-2 variants that can contribute to spike plasticity and modify spike expression, function, and immune evasion properties.",

    "abstract": "Aging is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid and prion-like proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these proteins arise remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that transcript errors generate amyloid and prion-like proteins in a wide variety of human cell types, including stem cells, brain organoids, and fully differentiated neurons. Intriguingly, some of these proteins are identical to proteins previously implicated in familial cases of amyloid diseases, raising the possibility that both familial and non-familial cases are caused by identical mutant proteins. However, transcript errors also generate amyloid proteins that have not been observed before, suggesting that aging cells are exposed to a second class of pathogenic proteins we are currently unaware of. Finally, we show that transcript errors are readily generated by DNA damage, a hallmark of human aging and a staple of multiple proteotoxic diseases, including Alzheimers disease. Together, these observations greatly expand our understanding of mutagenesis in human aging and disease and suggest a new mechanism by which amyloid diseases can develop.",

Here, we identify Greb1l mutants as the first mouse model of criss-cross heart. Based on 3D quantifications of shape changes, we demonstrate that torsion of the atrioventricular canal occurs together with supero-inferior ventricles at E10.5, after heart looping. Mutants phenocopy specific features of partial deficiency in retinoic acid signalling, suggesting that GREB1L is a novel modulator of this signalling. Spatio-temporal gene mapping and cross-correlated transcriptomic analyses further reveal the role of Greb1l in maintaining a pool of precursor cells during heart tube elongation, by controlling ribosome biogenesis and cell differentiation. Growth arrest and malposition of the outflow tract are predictive of abnormal tube remodelling in mutants.

    "abstract": "Viruses play a crucial role in agroecosystem functioning. However, few studies have examined the diversity of the soil virome, especially when it comes to RNA viruses. Despite the great progress in viral metagenomics and metatranscriptomics (metaviromics) toward RNA viruses characterization, soil RNA viruses ecology is embryonic compared to DNA viruses. We currently lack a wet lab. method to accurately unhide the true soil viral diversity. To overcome this limitation, we developed dsRNA-based methods capitalizing on our expertise in soil RNA extraction and dsRNA extraction ported from studies of phyllosphere viral diversity. This proposed method detected both RNA and DNA viruses and is proven to capture a greater soil virus diversity than existing methods, virion-associated nucleic enrichment, and metaviromics. Indeed, using this method we detected 284 novel RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and expanded the diversity of Birnaviridae and Retroviridae viral families to agricultural soil, which, to our knowledge, have never been reported in such ecosystem. The dsRNA-based method is cost-effective in terms of affordability and requirements for data processing, facilitating large-scale and high-throughput soil sample processing to unlock the potential of the soil virome and its impact on biogeochemical processes (e.g. carbon and nutrient cycling). This method can also benefit future studies of viruses in complex environments, for example, to characterize RNA viruses in the human gut or aquatic environment where RNA viruses are less studied mainly because of technical limitations.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TF) are proteins that bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner to regulate gene transcription. Despite their unique intrinsic sequence preferences, in vivo genomic occupancy profiles of TFs differ across cellular contexts. Hence, deciphering the sequence determinants of TF binding, both intrinsic and context-specific, is essential to understand gene regulation and the impact of regulatory, non-coding genetic variation. Biophysical models trained on in vitro TF binding assays can estimate intrinsic affinity landscapes and predict occupancy based on TF concentration and affinity. However, these models cannot adequately explain context-specific, in vivo binding profiles. Conversely, deep learning models, trained on in vivo TF binding assays, effectively predict and explain genomic occupancy profiles as a function of complex regulatory sequence syntax, albeit without a clear biophysical interpretation. To reconcile these complementary models of in vitro and in vivo TF binding, we developed Affinity Distillation (AD), a method that extracts thermodynamic affinities de-novo from deep learning models of TF chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments by marginalizing away the influence of genomic sequence context. Applied to neural networks modeling diverse classes of yeast and mammalian TFs, AD predicts energetic impacts of sequence variation within and surrounding motifs on TF binding as measured by diverse in vitro assays with superior dynamic range and accuracy compared to motif-based methods. Furthermore, AD can accurately discern affinities of TF paralogs. Our results highlight thermodynamic affinity as a key determinant of in vivo binding, suggest that deep learning models of in vivo binding implicitly learn high-resolution affinity landscapes, and show that these affinities can be successfully distilled using AD. This new biophysical interpretation of deep learning models enables high-throughput in silico experiments to explore the influence of sequence context and variation on both intrinsic affinity and in vivo occupancy.",

    "abstract": "Distinct functions mediated by members of the monopolar spindle-one-binder (MOB) family of proteins remain elusive beyond the evolutionary conserved and well-established roles of MOB1A and B in regulating the Hippo pathway. Since MOB proteins are adaptors, understanding how they engage in protein-protein interactions and complexes assembly is essential to define the full scope of their biological functions. To address this, we undertook a proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) approach to define the interactomes of all seven human MOB proteins in HeLa and HEK293 cell lines. We uncovered > 200 interactions, of which at least 70% are unreported on BioGrid. The generated dataset reliably recalled the bona fide interactors of the well-studied MOBs. We further defined the common and differential interactome between different MOBs on a subfamily and an individual level. We discovered a unique interaction between MOB3C and 7 out of 10 protein subunits of the RNase P complex, an endonuclease that catalyzes tRNA 5 maturation. As a proof-of-principle for the robustness of the generated dataset, we validated the specific interaction of MOB3C with catalytically active RNase P by using affinity purification-mass spectrometry and pre-tRNA cleavage assays of MOB3C pulldowns. In summary, our data provide novel insights into the biology of MOB proteins and reveal the first interactors of MOB3C, components of the RNase P complex, and hence an exciting nexus with RNA biology.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to support cell growth and proliferation in harsh environments. While many studies have documented the importance of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in tumor growth, some cancer cells experience conditions of reduced OXPHOS in vivo and induce alternative metabolic pathways to compensate. To assess how human cells respond to mitochondrial dysfunction, we performed metabolomics in fibroblasts and plasma from patients with inborn errors of mitochondrial metabolism, and in cancer cells subjected to inhibition of the electron transport chain (ETC). All these analyses revealed extensive perturbations in purine-related metabolites; in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, ETC blockade led to purine metabolite accumulation arising from a reduced cytosolic NAD+/NADH ratio (NADH reductive stress). Stable isotope tracing demonstrated that ETC deficiency suppressed de novo purine nucleotide synthesis while enhancing purine salvage. Analysis of NSCLC patients infused with [U-13C]glucose revealed that tumors with markers of low oxidative mitochondrial metabolism exhibited high expression of the purine salvage enzyme HPRT1 and abundant levels of the HPRT1 product inosine monophosphate (IMP). ETC blockade also induced production of ribose-5 phosphate (R5P) by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and import of purine nucleobases. Blocking either HPRT1 or nucleoside transporters sensitized cancer cells to ETC inhibition, and overexpressing nucleoside transporters was sufficient to drive growth of NSCLC xenografts. Collectively, this study mechanistically delineates how cells compensate for suppressed purine metabolism in response to ETC blockade, and uncovers a new metabolic vulnerability in tumors experiencing NADH excess.",

Characterizing this heterogeneity is crucial for drug development and quality assessment, but existing methods are limited in their ability to analyze intact glycoproteins. Here, we present a new approach to glycoform fingerprinting that uses proton-transfer charge-reduction with gas-phase fractionation to analyze intact glycoproteins by mass spectrometry. The method provides a detailed landscape of the intact molecular weights present in biotherapeutic protein preparations in a single experiment and offers insights into glycoform composition when coupled with a suitable bioinformatic strategy. We tested the approach on various biotherapeutic molecules, including Fc-fusion, VHH-fusion, and peptide-bound MHC class II complexes to demonstrate efficacy in measuring the proteoform-level diversity of biotherapeutics. Notably, we inferred the glycoform distribution for hundreds of molecular weights for the eight-times glycosylated fusion drug IL22-Fc, enabling correlations between glycoform sub-populations and the drugs pharmacological properties. Our method is broadly applicable and provides a powerful tool to assess the molecular heterogeneity of emerging biotherapeutics.",

    "abstract": "With advances in machine learning (ML)-assisted protein engineering, models based on data, biophysics, and natural evolution are being used to propose informed libraries of protein variants to explore. Synthesizing these libraries for experimental screens is a major bottleneck, as the cost of obtaining large numbers of exact gene sequences is often prohibitive. Degenerate codon (DC) libraries are a cost-effective alternative for generating combinatorial mutagenesis libraries where mutations are targeted to a handful of amino acid sites. However, existing computational methods to optimize DC libraries to include desired protein variants are not well suited to design libraries for ML-assisted protein engineering. To address these drawbacks, we present DEgenerate Codon Optimization for Informed Libraries (DeCOIL), a generalized method which directly optimizes DC libraries to be useful for protein engineering: to sample protein variants that are likely to have both high fitness and high diversity in the sequence search space. Using computational simulations and wet-lab experiments, we demonstrate that DeCOIL is effective across two specific case studies, with potential to be applied to many other use cases. DeCOIL offers several advantages over existing methods, as it is direct, easy-to-use, generalizable, and scalable. With accompanying software (https://github.com/jsunn-y/DeCOIL), DeCOIL can be readily implemented to generate desired informed libraries.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=114 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/540424v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16ce726org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bb8a2aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6be56borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a2efb6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Silencing pathways prevent transposable element (TE) proliferation and help to maintain genome integrity through cell division. Silenced genomic regions can be classified as either euchromatic or heterochromatic, and are targeted by genetically separable epigenetic pathways. In plants, the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway targets mostly euchromatic regions, while CMT methyltransferases are mainly associated with heterochromatin. However, many epigenetic features - including DNA methylation patterning - are largely indistinguishable between these regions, so how the functional separation is maintained is unclear. The linker histone H1 is preferentially localized to heterochromatin and has been proposed to restrict RdDM from encroachment. To test this hypothesis, we followed RdDM genomic localization in an h1 mutant by performing ChIP-seq on the largest subunit, NRPE1, of the central RdDM polymerase (Pol V). Loss of H1 resulted in heterochromatic TE enrichment by NRPE1. Increased NRPE1 binding was associated with increased chromatin accessibility in h1, suggesting that H1 restricts NRPE1 occupancy by compacting chromatin. However, RdDM occupancy did not impact H1 localization, demonstrating that H1 hierarchically restricts RdDM positioning. H1 mutants experience major symmetric (CG and CHG) DNA methylation gains, and by generating an h1/nrpe1 double mutant, we demonstrate these gains are largely independent of RdDM. However, loss of NRPE1 occupancy from a subset of euchromatic regions in h1 corresponded to loss of methylation in all sequence contexts, while at ectopically bound heterochromatic loci, NRPE1 deposition correlated with increased methylation specifically in the CHH context. Additionally, we found that H1 restricts the occupancy of the methylation reader and activator complex component, SUVH1, indicating that H1s regulatory control of methylation pathways is not limited to RdDM. Together, the results support a model whereby H1 helps maintain the exclusivity of heterochromatin by preventing encroachment from other competing pathways.",

    "abstract": "RNA methylation at the N6 position of adenosine residues (m6A) has been demonstrated to be a vital epigenetic mark in eukaryotes. In plants, it is involved in a myriad of developmental and stress responsive pathways, such as cold stress. However, the role of MTA (m6A writer) itself in such processes remains obscured. Here, we show that the cold induced changes in abundance of differentially methylated transcripts are at-least partly due to the differences in the rates of transcription of such transcripts. RNAPII stalling was observed only on RNA methylation motifs that were decorated with m6A, and those that had a specific nucleotide composition. We note that the downregulation of genes in a mta mutant is a result of lower transcription of these genes. Moreover, 5 ends of transcripts from a subset of genes are disproportionately more accumulated in mta as compared to wild type under cold stress. In the mta mutant, genes corresponding to these transcripts had significantly reduced RNAPII occupancy on their 3 ends but not on 5 ends indicating that mta serves as an important factor for RNAPII elongation in a subset of genes. Taken together, our data suggest a novel direct role for MTA as a gene specific influencer of RNAPII elongation dynamics and thus introduces a new path by which the m6A methylation machinery may affect differential gene expression during stress in plants.",

    "abstract": "To survive stress, eukaryotes selectively translate stress-related transcripts while inhibiting growth-associated protein production. How this translational reprogramming occurs under biotic stress has not been systematically studied. To identify common features shared by transcripts with stress-upregulated translation efficiency (TE-up), we first performed high-resolution ribosome-sequencing in Arabidopsis during pattern-triggered immunity and found that TE-up transcripts are enriched with upstream open reading frames (uORFs). Under non-stress conditions, start codons of these uORFs (uAUGs) have higher-than-background ribosomal association. Upon immune induction, there is an overall downshift in ribosome occupancy at uAUGs, accompanied by enhanced translation of main ORFs (mORFs). Using in planta nucleotide-resolution mRNA structurome probing, we discovered that this stress-induced switch in translation is mediated by highly structured regions detected downstream of uAUGs in TE-up transcripts. Without stress, these structures are responsible for uORF-mediated inhibition of mORF translation by slowing progression of the translation preinitiation complex to initiate translation from uAUGs, instead of mAUGs. In response to immune induction, uORF-inhibition is alleviated by three Ded1p/DDX3X-homologous RNA helicases which unwind the RNA structures, allowing ribosomes to bypass the inhibitory uORFs and upregulate defence protein production. Conservation of the RNA helicases suggests that mRNA structurome remodelling is a general mechanism for stress-induced translation across kingdoms.",

In  selfish uptake, polysaccharides are bound at the outer membrane, partially hydrolyzed, and transported into the periplasmic space without loss of hydrolysis products, thus limiting the availability of smaller sugars to the surrounding environment. Selfish uptake is widespread in environments ranging from the oceans cool, oxygen-rich, organic carbon-poor waters to the warm, carbon-rich, anoxic environment of the human gut. We provide a detailed guide of how to hunt for selfish bacteria, including how to rapidly visualize selfish uptake in complex bacterial communities, identify selfish organisms, and distinguish the activity of selfish organisms from other members of the community.",

    "abstract": "Bacteroides fragilis comprises 1-5% of the gut microbiota in healthy individuals but can expand to >50% of the population in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients experiencing inflammation. The mechanisms underlying such microbial blooms are poorly understood, but the gut of UC patients has physicochemical features that differ from healthy patients and that likely impact microbial growth and community structure. In UC colectomy patients with surgically created ileoanal pouches, levels of the bile acid deoxycholate (DC) are reduced in the pouch. We developed a B. fragilis strain isolated from a UC patient with pouch inflammation (i.e. pouchitis) as a genetic model system and have used this strain to identify genes and pathways that impact fitness in DC and crude bile. Treatment of B. fragilis with a DC concentration congruent with a healthy human gut reduced cell growth and remodeled transcription of approximately one-quarter of all genes. DC strongly induced transcription of chaperones and select transcriptional regulators and efflux systems and downregulated protein synthesis genes. We further defined B. fragilis genes that impacted fitness in media containing DC or crude bile using a barcoded collection of {approx}50,000 unique mutants. Genes that contribute to cell envelope functions including cardiolipin synthesis, cell surface glycosylation, and systems implicated in sodium-dependent bioenergetics were major bile acid fitness factors. The correspondence between genes that were transcriptionally regulated and genes that impacted fitness in bile was limited. Our study provides a genome-scale view of a B. fragilis bile response and genetic determinants of fitness in DC and crude bile.\n\nImportanceThe Gram negative nanaerobe, Bacteroides fragilis, is a common member of the human gut microbiota that can colonize multiple niches within the host and impact human physiology through a variety of mechanisms. Identification of genes that enable B. fragilis to grow, and often bloom, across a range of host environments has been impeded in part by the relatively limited genetic tractability of this species. We have developed a high-throughput genetic resource for a B. fragilis strain isolated from a UC pouchitis patient that we have used to define genetic determinants of fitness in a bile acid with reduced abundance in UC pouches, where B. fragilis often blooms. This study has uncovered pathways and processes that impact B. fragilis fitness in bile and that may contribute to blooms during bouts of gut inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Repair of DNA Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) produced in transcriptionally active chromatin occurs through a poorly characterized pathway called Transcription-Coupled DSB repair (TC-DSBR). Here, using a screening approach scoring multiple outputs in human cells, we identified the PER complex, a key module ensuring circadian oscillations, as a novel TC-DSBR player. Circadian rhythm has been involved in repair of UV-induced DNA damage but very little is known about its contribution to DSB repair pathways. We show that the PER complex is recruited at DSBs occurring in transcribed loci and we further found that the core protein PER2 contributes to targeting TC-DSBs at the nuclear envelope (NE) and to foster RAD51-mediated repair. PER2 deficiency triggers decreased DSB anchoring to the NE, resulting in an increase of DSB clustering and translocation frequency. In agreement, we found that the circadian clock also regulates DSB anchoring to the NE and RAD51 assembly. In conclusion, our study provides a direct link between the circadian rhythm and the response to DSBs occurring in active genes, opening new therapeutic strategies for chemotherapies based on topoisomerase poisons that mostly induce DSBs in active loci.",

    "abstract": "The first step towards eukaryotic genome duplication is loading of the replicative helicase, the Mcm2-7 complex, onto chromatin. This so-called \"licensing\" step is executed by the Pre-Replication Complex (Pre-RC) whose assembly on chromatin is nucleated by the DNA-binding activity of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC). It is thought that metazoan ORC, like the yeast complex, is recruited directly to chromatin by its ATP-dependent DNA binding and encirclement activity. However, we have previously shown that this DNA binding mode is dispensable for chromatin recruitment of fly ORC, raising the question of how metazoan ORC binds chromosomes. We show here that the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of fly Orc1 is both necessary and sufficient for recruitment of ORC to chromosomes in vivo and demonstrate that this activity is regulated by IDR phosphorylation. In vitro studies show that the IDR alone binds DNA and this bestows the ORC holocomplex with a high-affinity ATP-independent DNA binding mode. Interestingly, we find that Orc1 IDRs have diverged so markedly across metazoans that they are unrecognizable as orthologs and yet we find that these compositionally homologous sequences retain DNA and chromatin binding activity down to basal metazoans. Altogether, these data suggest that chromatin is recalcitrant to ORCs ATP-dependent DNA binding activity and we propose that this necessitates IDR-dependent chromatin tethering which poises ORC to opportunistically encircle nucleosome free regions as they become available. This work reveals a novel step in metazoan replication licensing and expands our understanding of disordered protein homology and evolution by stretching the relationship between primary structure and function.",

    "abstract": "The nucleosome is the fundamental gene-packing unit in eukaryotes. Nucleosomes comprise [~]147 bp DNA wrapped around an octameric histone protein core composed of two H2A-H2B dimers and one (H3-H4)2 tetramer. The strong yet flexible DNA-histone interactions are a physical basis of the dynamic regulation of genes packaged in chromatin. The dynamic nature of DNA-histone interactions implies that nucleosomes dissociate DNA-histone contacts transiently and repeatedly. This kinetic instability may lead to spontaneous nucleosome disassembly or histone exchange between nucleosomes. At a high nucleosome concentration, nucleosome-nucleosome collisions and subsequent histone exchange would be a more likely pathway, where nucleosomes act as their own histone chaperone. The spontaneous histone exchange would serve as a mechanism for maintaining the overall chromatin stability although it has never been reported. We employed three-color single-molecule FRET (smFRET) to demonstrate that histone H2A-H2B dimers are exchanged spontaneously between nucleosomes and that the time scale is on a few tens of seconds at a physiological nucleosome concentration. The rate of histone exchange increases at a higher monovalent salt concentration, with histone acetylated nucleosomes, and in the presence of histone chaperone Nap1, while it remains unchanged at a higher temperature, and decreases upon DNA methylation. These results support histone exchange via transient and repetitive partial disassembly of the nucleosome and corroborate spontaneous histone diffusion in a compact chromatin context, modulating the local concentrations of histone modifications and variants.",

    "abstract": "CDK1-cyclin B1 kinase is the main driver of mitosis and initiates the morphological changes that characterise mitosis, including mitotic spindle assembly and formation of the outer kinetochore. CDK1-cyclin B1 activity is also critically required for spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) signalling during mitosis. In particular, CDK1-cyclin B1 promotes the targeting of the principal spindle checkpoint kinase MPS1 to kinetochores, leading to the recruitment of SAC proteins to the outer kinetochore scaffold protein KNL1 and initiation of checkpoint signalling. However, cells expressing kinetochore-tethered MPS1 still require CDK1 activity for SAC signalling, suggesting that CDK1 plays both MPS1-dependent and -independent roles in regulating the SAC. Here we show that the latter is due to CDK1-mediated kinetochore recruitment of KNL1, which is reversed by the PP1 phosphatase at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Our findings explain the abrupt and irreversible termination of spindle checkpoint signalling in anaphase, since the drop of CDK1 activity means both MPS1 and the spindle checkpoint scaffold KNL1 are lost from kinetochores.\n\nSummaryLim-Manley and Gruneberg investigate MPS1-independent roles of CDK1 in spindle checkpoint signalling.

By unbiasedly detecting repair-enriched segments, we find that repair proteins often occupy entire topologically associating domains and mimic variability in chromatin loop anchoring.

    "abstract": "Single-cell genomics technologies enable multimodal profiling of millions of cells across temporal and spatial dimensions. Experimental limitations prevent the measurement of all-encompassing cellular states in their native temporal dynamics or spatial tissue niche. Optimal transport theory has emerged as a powerful tool to overcome such constraints, enabling the recovery of the original cellular context. However, most algorithmic implementations currently available have not kept up the pace with increasing dataset complexity, so that current methods are unable to incorporate multimodal information or scale to single-cell atlases. Here, we introduce multi-omics single-cell optimal transport (moscot), a general and scalable framework for optimal transport applications in single-cell genomics, supporting multimodality across all applications. We demonstrate moscots ability to efficiently reconstruct developmental trajectories of 1.7 million cells of mouse embryos across 20 time points and identify driver genes for first heart field formation. The moscot formulation can be used to transport cells across spatial dimensions as well: To demonstrate this, we enrich spatial transcriptomics datasets by mapping multimodal information from single-cell profiles in a mouse liver sample, and align multiple coronal sections of the mouse brain. We then present moscot.spatiotemporal, a new approach that leverages gene expression across spatial and temporal dimensions to uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics of mouse embryogenesis. Finally, we disentangle lineage relationships in a novel murine, time-resolved pancreas development dataset using paired measurements of gene expression and chromatin accessibility, finding evidence for a shared ancestry between delta and epsilon cells.

    "abstract": "During communication in real-life settings, our brain often needs to integrate auditory and visual information, and at the same time actively focus on the relevant sources of information, while ignoring interference from irrelevant events. The interaction between integration and attention processes remains poorly understood. Here, we use rapid invisible frequency tagging (RIFT) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate how attention affects auditory and visual information processing and integration, during multimodal communication. We presented human participants (male and female) with videos of an actress uttering action verbs (auditory; tagged at 58 Hz) accompanied by two movie clips of hand gestures on both sides of fixation (attended stimulus tagged at 65 Hz; unattended stimulus tagged at 63 Hz). Integration difficulty was manipulated by a lower-order auditory factor (clear/degraded speech) and a higher-order visual semantic factor (matching/mismatching gesture). We observed an enhanced neural response to the attended visual information during degraded speech compared to clear speech. For the unattended information, the neural response to mismatching gestures was enhanced compared to matching gestures. Furthermore, signal power at the intermodulation frequencies of the frequency tags, indexing non-linear signal interactions, was enhanced in left frontotemporal and frontal regions. Focusing on LIFG, this enhancement was specific for the attended information, for those trials that benefitted from integration with a matching gesture. Higher power at this intermodulation frequency was related to faster reaction times. Together, our results suggest that attention modulates the strength and speed of audiovisual processing and interaction, depending on the congruence and quality of the sensory input.",

Neural representations for concepts (concept cells), which presumably support high-level conceptual processing, have been also found in the same brain region. However, the relationship behind those neural representations is still unclear. We propose a unified model called \"disentangled successor information (DSI)\" that produces neural representations for physical space and linguistic concepts. DSI generates gridlike representations in a 2-dimensional space that highly resemble those observed in the brain. Moreover, the same model creates concept-specific representations from linguistic inputs, corresponding to concept cells. Mathematically, DSI approximate value functions for navigation and word vectors obtained by word embedding methods, thus those representations support both spatial navigation and analogical inference based on a simple arithmetic computation. Our results suggest that representations and computation for physical space and linguistic concepts in the brain can emerge from a shared mechanism.",

Particularly, we characterized how functional neural activation and reinstatement of neural patterns change over time, assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging combined with representational (dis)similarity analysis (RSA). Our results showed that memory consolidation in children was less robust (i.e., more forgetting) compared to young adults. For correctly retained remote memories, young adults showed increased neural activation from short to long delay in neocortical (parietal, prefrontal and occipital) and cerebellar brain regions, while children showed increased neural activation in prefrontal and decrease in neural activity in parietal brain regions over time. In addition, there was an overall attenuated scene-specific memory reinstatement of neural patterns in children compared to young adults. At the same time, we observed category-based reinstatement in medial-temporal, neocortical (prefrontal and parietal), and cerebellar brain regions only in children.

Here we show that GPCR kinase 2 (GRK2) orchestrates this process during endogenous Hh pathway activation in the primary cilium. Upon SMO activation, GRK2 rapidly relocalizes from the ciliary base to the shaft, triggering SMO phosphorylation and PKA-C interaction. Reconstitution studies reveal that GRK2 phosphorylation enables active SMO to bind PKA-C directly. Lastly, the SMO-GRK2-PKA pathway underlies Hh signal transduction in a range of cellular and in vivo models. Thus, GRK2 phosphorylation of ciliary SMO, and the ensuing PKA-C binding and inactivation, are critical initiating events for the intracellular steps in Hh signaling. More broadly, our study suggests an expanded role for GRKs in enabling direct GPCR interactions with diverse intracellular effectors.",

While distinct selective autophagy pathways mediate the degradation of diverse cellular substrates including organelles and pathogens, whether these distinct pathways can influence one another remains unknown. We address this question here using pexophagy, the autophagic degradation of peroxisomes, as a model. We demonstrate in cells that upregulated pexophagy exhausts selective autophagy and limits the degradation of both mitochondria and protein aggregates. We confirmed this finding in the pexophagy-mediated form of Zellweger Spectrum Disorder, a rare disease characterized by peroxisome dysfunction. Further, we extend the generalizability of limited selective autophagy by determining that increased aggrephagy reduces pexophagy using a model of Huntingtons Disease. Our findings suggest that the degradative capacity of selective autophagy can become limited by an increased substrate load.",

The interpretation of communication signals depends not only on the signals content, but also on a receivers individual experience. Experiences throughout life may interact to affect behavioral plasticity, such that a lack of developmental sensory exposure could constrain adult learning, while salient adult social experiences could remedy developmental deficits. We investigated how experiences impact the formation and direction of female auditory preferences in the zebra finch. Zebra finches form long-lasting pair bonds and females learn preferences for their mates vocalizations. We found that after two weeks of cohabitation with a male, females formed pair-bonds and learned to prefer their mates song regardless of whether they were reared with (\"normally-reared\") or without (\"song-naive\") developmental exposure to song. In contrast, females that heard but did not physically interact with a male did not prefer his song. Moreover, even following mating, song-naive females failed to show species-typical preferences for courtship song, hinting that mating is insufficient to ameliorate broader deficits in sensory processing that arise during development. Thus, courtship and mating interactions, but not acoustic-only interactions, strongly influence preference learning regardless of rearing experience, and may dynamically drive auditory plasticity for recognition and preference.",

Enhlink uses an ensemble strategy that integrates cell-level technical covariates to control for batch effects and biological covariates to infer robust condition-specific links and their associated p-values. It can integrate simultaneous gene expression and chromatin accessibility measurements of individual cells profiled by multi-omic experiments for increased specificity. We evaluated Enhlink using simulated and real scATAC-seq data, including those paired with physical enhancer-promoter links enumerated by promoter capture Hi-C and with multi-omic scATAC-/RNA-seq data we generated from the mouse striatum. These examples demonstrated that our method outperforms popular alternative strategies.

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and therapy-resistant brain tumors prevalent in both adults and children. Despite extensive research to understand GBM pathology, it remains unclear how neural cells in the human brain interact with GBM cells to support their brain propagation and therapy resistance and whether GBM cells exert any influence on the properties of human neural cells. In this study, we co-culture human stem cell-derived subpallial telencephalic organoids with patient-derived proneural or mesenchymal GBM spheroids to investigate their reciprocal interactions. We show that both proneural and mesenchymal GBM spheroids readily fuse and propagate with human organoids, forming organoid-GBM chimeras, without the need for exogenous growth factors. GBM cells within the chimeras adapt by modulating gene expression profiles consistent with diminished proliferation, heightened hypoxia, increased angiogenesis, and proneural-to-mesenchymal transition in proneural GBM. Both proneural or mesenchymal GBMs also exert an impact on the properties of neural cells in the chimeras, leading to the suppression of neuronal genes and an upregulation expression of genes associated with hypoxia and angiogenesis. Collectively, this study identifies specific genes and molecular pathways that can be altered in GBM and neural cells by reciprocal interactions in a human developing brain-like environment for an increased understanding of GBM pathology and future therapy development.",

    "abstract": "The activation of apoptosis signalling by TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) through receptor binding is a fundamental mechanism of cell death induction and is often perturbed in cancer cells to enhance their cell survival and treatment resistance. Ubiquitination plays an important role in the regulation of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, and here we investigate the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in oesophageal cancer cells. Knockdown of Itch expression resulted in resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, caspase-8 activation, Bid cleavage and also promoted cisplatin resistance. Whilst the assembly of the death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) at the plasma membrane was not perturbed relative to the control, the TRAIL-R2 receptor was mis-localised in the Itch-knockdown cells. Further, we observed significant mitochondrial widening with an increased cholesterol content. An inhibitor of cholesterol trafficking, U18666A, was able to replicate some of the effects of Itch knockdown, including protection from TRAIL-induced apoptosis, reduced caspase-8 activation, Bid cleavage and Cisplatin resistance. This study highlights the importance of Itch in regulating the crosstalk between mitochondrial cholesterol and TRAIL-induced apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is the rate-limiting enzyme for glucose oxidation that links glycolysis-derived pyruvate with the TCA cycle. Although skeletal muscle is a significant site for glucose oxidation and is closely linked with metabolic flexibility, the importance of muscle PDH during rest and exercise has yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that mice with muscle-specific deletion of PDH exhibit rapid weight loss and suffer from severe lactic acidosis, ultimately leading to early mortality under low-fat diet provision. Furthermore, loss of muscle PDH induces adaptive anaplerotic compensation by increasing pyruvate-alanine cycling and glutaminolysis. Interestingly, high-fat diet supplementation effectively abolishes the early mortality and rescues the overt metabolic phenotype induced by muscle PDH deficiency. Despite increased reliance on fatty acid oxidation during high-fat diet provision, loss of muscle PDH worsens exercise performance and induces lactic acidosis. These observations illustrate the importance of muscle PDH in maintaining metabolic flexibility and preventing the development of metabolic disorders.\n\nHighlightsO_LISkeletal Muscle PDH is essential for survival\nC_LIO_LILoss of muscle PDH induces lactic acidosis and premature death\nC_LIO_LILoss of muscle PDH enhances pyruvate transformations and glutaminolysis\nC_LIO_LIHigh-fat diet supplementation abolishes early mortality and overt phenotype induced by muscle PDH loss\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Identifying novel regulators of vascular smooth muscle cell function is necessary to further understand cardiovascular diseases. We previously identified cytoglobin, a hemoglobin homolog, with myogenic and cytoprotective roles in the vasculature. The specific mechanism of action of cytoglobin is unclear but does not seem to be related to oxygen transport or storage like hemoglobin. Herein, transcriptomic profiling of injured carotid arteries in cytoglobin global knockout mice revealed that cytoglobin deletion accelerated the loss of contractile genes and increased DNA damage. Overall, we show that cytoglobin is actively translocated into the nucleus of vascular smooth muscle cells through a redox signal driven by NOX4. We demonstrate that nuclear cytoglobin heterodimerizes with the non-histone chromatin structural protein HMGB2. Our results are consistent with a previously unknown function by which a non-erythrocytic hemoglobin inhibits DNA damage and regulates gene programs in the vasculature by modulating the genome-wide binding of HMGB2.",

    "abstract": "Understanding normal and aberrant in vivo cell behaviors is necessary to develop clinical interventions to thwart disease initiation and progression. It is therefore critical to optimize imaging approaches that facilitate the observation of cell dynamics in situ, where tissue structure and composition remains unperturbed. The epidermis is the bodys outermost barrier as well as the source of the most prevalent human cancers, namely cutaneous skin carcinomas. The accessibility of skin tissue presents a unique opportunity to monitor epithelial and dermal cell behaviors in intact animals using noninvasive intravital microscopy. Nevertheless, this sophisticated imaging approach has primarily been achieved using upright multiphoton microscopy, which represents a significant barrier-for-entry for most investigators. In this study, we present a custom-designed 3D-printed microscope stage insert suitable for use with inverted confocal microscopes that streamlines long-term intravital imaging of ear skin in live transgenic mice. We believe this invention, which may be readily customized to image other organ systems, will prove invaluable to the cell biology community by significantly enhancing the accessibility of intravital microscopy. This technological advancement is critical to bolster our understanding of live cell dynamics in both normal and disease contexts.",

    "abstract": "Myogenesis, the progression of proliferating skeletal myoblasts to terminally differentiated myotubes, regulates thousands of target genes. Uninterrupted linear arrays of such genes are differentially associated with specific chromosomes, suggesting chromosome specific regulatory roles in myogenesis. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), a tumor of skeletal muscle, shares common features with normal muscle cells. We hypothesized that RMS and myogenic cells possess differences in chromosomal organization related to myogenic gene arrangement. We compared the organizational characteristics of chromosomes 2 and 18, chosen for their difference in myogenic gene arrangement, in cultured RMS cell lines and normal myoblasts and myotubes. We found chromosome-specific differences in organization during normal myogenesis, with increased area occupied and a shift in peripheral localization specifically for chromosome 2. Most strikingly, we found a differentiation-dependent difference in positioning of chromosome 2 relative to the nuclear axis, with preferential positioning along the major nuclear axis present only in myotubes. RMS cells demonstrated no preference for such axial positioning, but induced differentiation through transfection of the pro-myogenic miRNA miR-206 resulted in an increase of major axial positioning of chromosome 2. Our findings identify both a differentiation-dependent, chromosome-specific change in organization in normal myogenesis, and highlight the role of chromosomal spatial organization in myogenic differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The oleaginous yeast Rhodotorula toruloides is a promising host for sustainable bioproduction due to its capacity to naturally utilize xylose present in lignocellulosic biomass, an abundant and renewable resource. However, its xylose consumption pathway is still not completely understood. To better understand the potential limitations in xylose utilization in R. toruloides, heterologous xylose reductase from Scheffersomyces stipitis, together with the native and heterologous xylulokinases from three different microorganisms (Scheffersomyces stipitis, Candida intermedia, and Escherichia coli) were overexpressed solely and in combination. The overexpression of xylulokinases showed more significant improvements in terms of xylose consumption rate compared to the single overexpression of xylose reductase. When the heterologous xylulokinase from Escherichia coli was overexpressed, the specific xylose consumption rate was improved by 66% and the maximum specific growth rate by 30% compared to the parental strain. The xylose specific consumption rate increased by 146% and the maximum specific growth rate increased by 118% when heterologous genes for xylose reductase and xylulokinase from E. coli were overexpressed together. These results suggest that the low expression of xylulokinase in R. toruloides, which has been reported previously, could limit its sugar consumption, while supporting higher lipid accumulation in this yeast.",

Transcription factors bind to transcription response elements (TREs) in gene promoters, initiating transcription. Synthetic promoters, derived from natural TREs, can be engineered to control exogenous gene expression using endogenous transcription machinery.

However, a reliable and precise method for selecting minimally-sized synthetic promoters with desired background, amplitude, and stimulation response profiles has been elusive. In this study, we introduce a massively parallel reporter assay library containing 6184 synthetic promoters, each less than 250 bp in length. This comprehensive library allows for rapid identification of promoters with optimal transcriptional output parameters across multiple cell lines and stimuli. We showcase this librarys utility to identify promoters activated in unique cell types, and in response to metabolites, mitogens, cellular toxins, and agonism of both aminergic and non-aminergic GPCRs. We further show these promoters can be used in luciferase reporter assays, eliciting 50-100 fold dynamic ranges in response to stimuli. Our platform is effective, easily implemented, and provides a solution for selecting short-length promoters with precise performance for a multitude of applications.",

Using structure-based template matches from PDB, protein pockets are featurized by the ligands which bind to their best co-complex template matches. The simplicity and interpretability of this approach provides a granular characterization of the human proteome at the protein pocket level instead of the traditional protein-level characterization by family, function, or pathway.

Developing a synthetic experimental system with a common theoretical framework that captures the emergence of short- and long-range spatial correlations (and anti-correlations) from interacting gene networks could serve to uncover generic scaling properties of these ubiquitous phenomena.\n\nResultsHere, we combine synthetic biology, statistical mechanics models and computational simulations to study the spatial behavior of synthetic gene networks (SGNs) in Escherichia coli quasi-2D colonies growing on hard agar. Guided by the combined mechanisms of the contact process lattice simulation and two-dimensional Ising model (CPIM), we describe the spatial behavior of bi-stable and chemically-coupled SGNs that self-organize into patterns of long-range correlations with power-law scaling or short-range anti-correlations. These patterns, resembling ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic configurations of the Ising model near critical points, maintain their scaling properties upon changes in growth rate and cell shape.\n\nConclusionsOur findings shed light on the spatial biology of coupled and bistable gene networks in growing cell populations. This emergent spatial behavior could provide insights into the study and engineering of self-organizing gene patterns in eukaryotic tissues and bacterial consortia.",
