    "abstract": "Vascular endothelial cells regulate their cell cycle as blood vessels remodel and mature, and as they transition from active angiogenesis to quiescence. Mechanical cues provided by fluid shear stress orchestrate this transition, and laminar blood flow instigates a quiescent (G0) state and homeostasis. However, how flow-mediated quiescence is set up and maintained is poorly understood. We found that flow-mediated endothelial cell quiescence has unique properties and temporal regulation of quiescence depth. Flow-exposed endothelial cells had a distinct transcriptome, and quiescent endothelial cells re-entered the cell cycle more rapidly after extended flow exposure compared to contact inhibition, indicating a shallow quiescence depth. The cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1B (p27) was required for endothelial cell flow-mediated quiescence but was not significantly expressed after extended flow exposure. Rather, flow-exposed endothelial cells first established a deep quiescence that subsequently became shallow, and p27 levels positively correlated with these distinct quiescent states. HES1 and ID3, transcriptional repressors of p27 downstream of flow-regulated Notch and BMP signaling, were required for flow-mediated quiescence depth changes and the reduced p27 levels associated with shallow quiescence. These findings are consistent with a model whereby flow-mediated endothelial cell quiescence depth is temporally regulated downstream of transcriptional regulation of p27.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=141 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/544403v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cceb43org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@169ab4eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6d96d0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c84a86_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LIDifferent quiescence stimuli lead to distinct transcriptional and functional quiescence profiles in endothelial cells\nC_LIO_LIFlow-mediated endothelial quiescence depth changes from deep to shallow over time and correlates with p27 levels\nC_LIO_LIHES1 and ID3, flow-upregulated repressors of p27 expression, are required for the temporal shift in quiescence depth under flow\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In many organisms, most notably Drosophila, homologous chromosomes in somatic cells associate with each other, a phenomenon known as somatic homolog pairing. Unlike in meiosis, where homology is read out at the level of DNA sequence complementarity, somatic homolog pairing takes place without double strand breaks or strand invasion, thus requiring some other mechanism for homologs to recognize each other. Several studies have suggested a \"specific button\" model, in which a series of distinct regions in the genome, known as buttons, can associate with each other, presumably mediated by different proteins that bind to these different regions. Here we consider an alternative model, which we term the \"button barcode\" model, in which there is only one type of recognition site or adhesion button, present in many copies in the genome, each of which can associate with any of the others with equal affinity. An important component of this model is that the buttons are non-uniformly distributed, such that alignment of a chromosome with its correct homolog, compared with a non-homolog, is energetically favored; since to achieve nonhomologous alignment, chromosomes would be required to mechanically deform in order to bring their buttons into mutual register. We investigated several types of barcodes and examined their effect on pairing fidelity. We found that high fidelity homolog recognition can be achieved by arranging chromosome pairing buttons according to an actual industrial barcode used for warehouse sorting. By simulating randomly generated non-uniform button distributions, many highly effective button barcodes can be easily found, some of which achieve virtually perfect pairing fidelity. This model is consistent with existing literature on the effect of translocations of different sizes on homolog pairing. We conclude that a button barcode model can attain highly specific homolog recognition, comparable to that seen in actual cells undergoing somatic homolog pairing, without the need for specific interactions. This model may have implications for how meiotic pairing is achieved.",

    "abstract": "Aquaporins provide a new class of genetic tools for imaging molecular activity in deep tissues by increasing the rate of cellular water diffusion, which generates magnetic resonance contrast. However, distinguishing aquaporin contrast from the tissue background is challenging because water diffusion is also influenced by structural factors such as cell size and packing density. Here, we developed and experimentally validated a Monte Carlo model to analyze how cell radius and intracellular volume fraction quantitatively affect aquaporin signals. We demonstrated that a differential imaging approach based on time-dependent changes in diffusivity can improve specificity by unambiguously isolating aquaporin-driven contrast from the tissue background. Finally, we used Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the connection between diffusivity and the percentage of cells engineered to express aquaporin, and established a simple mapping that accurately determined the volume fraction of aquaporin-expressing cells in mixed populations. This study creates a framework for broad applications of aquaporins, particularly in biomedicine and in vivo synthetic biology, where quantitative methods to measure the location and performance of genetic devices in whole vertebrates are necessary.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is one of the complex metabolic disorders associated with individuals leading sedentary lifestyles. It leads to several complications rendering the normal function of vital organs like heart, liver, kidney, eye and brain. Scientists and doctors across the globe are involved in research for understanding the complex genetics of this disorder and formulating newer therapeutics accordingly. The finding of potential chemical entities and their underlying agonists or antagonist activities significantly controls the disorder but with some consequences. Thus there is demand for natural compounds and indigenous treatment methods for controlling the disorder with least or no adverse consequences. In the current work we present computational prediction of gamma-oryzanol as potential agonist of human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-{gamma}). A group of four gamma-oryzanol compound structures reported in PubChem database were downloaded and docked in the ligand binding site of five different human PPAR-{gamma} structures reported in PDB database. It was observed that most of the gamma-oryzanol compounds occupied themselves in the ligand binding P1, P2, P3, P4 sites with similar orientations as that of co-crystal agonists. Their binding conformations were assisted by some reasonable docking scores (-7 to -11 kcal/mol) and hydrogen bond interactions with some important conserved amino acid residues lining the ligand binding site. Additionally we have done a comparative molecular dynamics studies to reveal the flexibility of gamma-oryzanol in the ligand binding site in comparison to the co-crystal agonist and a scaffold analysis using the structure of six agonists and gamma-oryzanol for fetching potential scaffolds which may helpful in designing of new chemical entities.",

    "abstract": "Dyneins is an AAA+ motor responsible for motility and force generation towards the minus end of microtubules. Dynein motility is powered by nucleotide-dependent transitions of its linker domain, which transitions between straight (post-powerstroke) and bent (pre-powerstroke) conformations. To understand the dynamics and energetics of the linker, we per-formed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of human dynein-2 primed for its power stroke. Simulations re-vealed that the linker can adopt either a bent conformation or a semi-bent conformation, separated by a 5.7 kT energy bar-rier. The linker cannot switch back to its straight conformation in the pre-powerstroke state due to a steric clash with the AAA+ ring. Simulations also showed that an isolated linker has a free energy minimum near the semi-bent conformation in the absence of the AAA+ ring, indicating that the linker stores mechanical energy as it bends and releases this energy during the powerstroke.",

We hypothesized that motion direction is computed not only from velocity but also spatial orientation signals - a  streak created by moving objects. We implemented this hypothesis in a Bayesian model, which quantifies knowledge with probability distributions, and tested its predictions using psychophysics and fMRI. Using a probabilistic pattern-based analysis, we decoded probability distributions of motion direction from trial-by-trial activity in the human visual cortex. Corroborating the predictions, the decoded distributions had a bimodal shape, with peaks that predicted the direction and magnitude of behavioral errors. Interestingly, we observed similar bimodality in the distribution of the observers behavioral responses across trials. Together, these results suggest that observers use spatial orientation signals when estimating motion direction. More broadly, our findings indicate that the cortical representation of low-level visual features, such as motion direction, can reflect a combination of several qualitatively distinct signals.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests brain-behavior predictions may require very large sample sizes. However, as the sample size increases, the amount of missing data also increases. Conventional methods, like complete-case analysis, discard useful information and shrink the sample size. To address the missing data problem, we investigated rescuing these missing data through imputation. Imputation is the substitution of estimated values for missing data to be used in downstream analyses. We integrated imputation methods into the Connectome-based Predictive Modeling (CPM) framework. Utilizing four open-source datasets--the Human Connectome Project, the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, the UCLA Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics, and the Healthy Brain Network (HBN)--we validated and compared our framework with different imputation methods against complete-case analysis for both missing connectomes and missing phenotypic measures scenarios. Imputing connectomes exhibited superior prediction performance on real and simulated missing data as compared to complete-case analysis. In addition, we found that imputation accuracy was a good indicator for choosing an imputation method for missing phenotypic measures but not informative for missing connectomes. In a real-world example predicting cognition using the HBN, we rescued 628 individuals through imputation, doubling the complete case sample size and increasing explained variance by 45%. Together, our results suggest that rescuing data with imputation, as opposed to discarding subjects with missing information, improves prediction performance.",

    "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a degenerative disease resulting from mechanical overload, where direct physical impacts on chondrocytes play a crucial role in disease development by inducing inflammation and extracellular matrix degradation. However, the signaling cascades that sense these physical impacts and induce the pathogenic transcriptional programs of KOA remain to be defined, which hinders the identification of novel therapeutic approaches. Recent studies have implicated a crucial role of Hippo signaling in osteoarthritis. Since Hippo signaling senses mechanical cues, we aimed to determine its role in chondrocyte responses to mechanical overload. Here we show that mechanical loading induces the expression of inflammatory and matrix-degrading genes by activating the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF{kappa}B) pathway in a Hippo-dependent manner. Applying mechanical compressional force to 3-dimensional cultured chondrocytes activated NF{kappa}B and induced the expression of NF{kappa}B target genes for inflammation and matrix degradation (i.e., IL1{beta} and ADAMTS4). Interestingly, deleting the Hippo pathway effector YAP or activating YAP by deleting core Hippo kinases LATS1/2 blocked the NF{kappa}B pathway activation induced by mechanical loading. Consistently, treatment with a LATS1/2 kinase inhibitor abolished the upregulation of IL1{beta} and ADAMTS4 caused by mechanical loading. Mechanistically, mechanical loading activates Protein Kinase C (PKC), which activates NF{kappa}B p65 by phosphorylating its Serine 536. Furthermore, the mechano-activation of both PKC and NF{kappa}B p65 is blocked in LATS1/2 or YAP knockout cells, indicating that the Hippo pathway is required by this mechanoregulation. Additionally, the mechanical loading-induced phosphorylation of NF{kappa}B p65 at Ser536 is blocked by the LATS1/2 inhibitor Lats-In-1 or the PKC inhibitor AEB-071. Our study suggests that the interplay of the Hippo signaling and PKC controls NF{kappa}B-mediated inflammation and matrix degradation in response to mechanical loading. Chemical inhibitors targeting Hippo signaling or PKC can prevent the mechanoresponses of chondrocytes associated with inflammation and matrix degradation, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for KOA.",

Only IVV embryos had well-defined ICM, indicating in vitro culture may delay the first cell fate commitment to ICM. Differences between IVV, IVC and IVR embryos were mainly contributed by ICM and transitional cells. Pathway analysis by using the differentially expressed genes of these non-TE cells between groups pointed to highly active metabolic and biosynthetic processes, with reduced cellular signaling and membrane transport in IVC embryos, which may lead to reduced developmental potential. IVR embryos had lower activities in metabolic and biosynthetic processes, but increased cellular signaling and membrane transport, suggesting these cellular mechanisms may contribute to the improved blastocyst development compared to IVC embryos. However, the IVR embryos had compromised development when compared to IVV embryos with notably over-active membrane transport activities that led to impaired ion homeostasis.\n\nSummary StatementSingle-cell transcriptomic analysis of bovine blastocysts produced in vivo, and in vitro in conventional and reduced nutrient conditions reveals the effect of culture environments on embryo developmental potential.",

Insects that feed on Brassicaceae represent one of the striking examples of co-evolutionary arms race. Insects specialized on Brassicaceae have evolved specific mechanisms to detoxify mustard oils (glucosinolates), while generalist species use detoxification enzymes that act on a variety of substrates. Understanding the gene evolution of detoxification and sensory repertoire in specialist and generalist Brassicaceae feeders will shed light on the processes involved in mediating hostplant ranges in herbivores. We use a comparative phylogenomic approach in 12 lepidopterans that feed on Brassicaceae, ranging from specialist to pests in their host range to examine the gene family expansion of detoxification and sensory gene families. We found that gene family expansions and contractions were larger in generalist herbivores compared to specialist herbivores. Gene evolutionary rate of detoxification genes reflected hostplant range where generalists had a higher evolutionary rate of detoxification genes that act on wide substrates while specialists had a higher evolutionary rate in genes that conjugate toxic compounds to hydrophilic byproducts. Our analysis on the nitrile specifier gene, a key innovation for feeding on Brassicaceae, indicated pervasive purifying selection with lineage specific differences in selection.

    "abstract": "It has long been known that the alteration of protein side chains which occlude or expose the heme cofactor to water can greatly affect the stability of the oxyferrous heme state. Here we demonstrate that the rate of dynamically-driven water penetration into the core of an artificial oxygen transport protein also correlates with oxyferrous state lifetime by reducing global dynamics, without altering the structure of the active site, via the simple linking of the two monomers in a homodimeric artificial oxygen transport protein using a glycine-rich loop. The tethering of these two helices does not significantly affect the active site structure, pentacoordinate heme binding affinity, reduction potential, or gaseous ligand affinity. It does, however, significantly reduce the hydration of the protein core as demonstrated by resonance Raman spectroscopy, backbone amide hydrogen exchange, and pKa shifts in buried histidine side chains. This further destabilizes the charge-buried entatic state and nearly triples the oxyferrous state lifetime. These data are the first direct evidence that dynamically-driven water penetration is a rate-limiting step in the oxidation of these complexes. It furthermore demonstrates that structural rigidity which limits water penetration is a critical design feature in metalloenzyme construction and provides an explanation for both the failures and successes of earlier attempts to create oxygen-binding proteins.\n\nSecondary AbstractSimple designed proteins offer a great opportunity to reveal the engineering parameters that underlay complex natural protein function. Here we use a relatively small perturbation - making a homodimeric oxygen transport protein into a single chain form - to reduce the overall conformational flexibility of a protein fold without detectably changing the structure of its active site. This reduces the ability of water to penetrate into the core of the protein where the oxygen-binding cofactor lies, extending the lifetime of the oxygen bound state more than threefold. This demonstrates that the control of water penetration is an important aspect of metalloenzyme catalysis, and thus metalloenzyme design.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates are membraneless organelles formed via phase separation of macromolecules, typically consisting of bond-forming \"stickers\" connected by flexible \"linkers\". Linkers have diverse roles, such as occupying space and facilitating interactions. To understand how linker length relative to other lengths affects condensation, we focus on the pyrenoid, which enhances photosynthesis in green algae. Specifically, we apply coarse-grained simulations and analytical theory to the pyrenoid proteins of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii: the rigid holoenzyme Rubisco and its flexible partner EPYC1. Remarkably, halving EPYC1 linker lengths decreases critical concentrations by ten-fold. We attribute this difference to the molecular \"fit\" between EPYC1 and Rubisco. Varying Rubisco sticker locations reveals that the native sites yield the poorest fit, thus optimizing phase separation. Surprisingly, shorter linkers mediate a transition to a gas of rods as Rubisco stickers approach the poles. These findings illustrate how intrinsically disordered proteins affect phase separation through the interplay of molecular length scales.",

    "abstract": "Functional connectivity (FC) is a widely used imaging parameter of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, low reliability has been a concern among researchers, particularly in small-sample-size studies. Previous studies have shown that FC based on longer fMRI scans was more reliable, therefore, a feasible solution is to predict long-scan FCs using existing short-scan FCs. This study explored three different generalized linear models (GLMs) using the human connectome project (HCP) dataset. We found that the GLM based on individual short-scan FC could effectively predict long-scan individual FC value, while GLMs based on whole-brain FCs and dynamic FC performed better in predicting long-scan summed FC value of whole brain. The models were explained through visualization of weights in models. Besides, the differences in three GLMs could be explained as differences in distribution features of FC matrices predicted by them. Results were validated in different datasets, including the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR) project and our local dataset. These models could be applied to improve the test-retest reliability of FC and to improve the performance of connectome-based predictive models (CPM). In conclusion, we developed three GLMs that could be used to predict long-scan FC from short-scan FC, and these models were robust across different datasets and could be applied to improve the test-retest reliability of FC and the performance of CPM.",

    "abstract": "Predictive modeling has now become a central technique in neuroimaging to identify complex brain-behavior relationships and test their generalizability to unseen data. However, data leakage, which unintentionally breaches the separation between data used to train and test the model, undermines the validity of predictive models. Although previous literature suggests that leakage is generally pervasive in machine learning, few studies have empirically evaluated the effects of leakage in neuroimaging data. Here, using over 500 different pipelines spanning four large neuroimaging datasets and three phenotypes, we evaluated six forms of leakage fitting into three broad categories: feature selection, covariate correction, and lack of independence between subjects. As expected, leakage via feature selection and repeated subjects drastically inflated prediction performance. Notably, other forms of leakage had only minor effects (e.g., leaky site correction) or even decreased prediction performance (e.g., leaky covariate regression). In some cases, leakage affected not only prediction performance, but also model coefficients, and thus neurobiological interpretations. Overall, our results illustrate the variable effects of leakage on prediction pipelines and underscore the importance of avoiding data leakage to improve the validity and reproducibility of predictive modeling.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need for better understanding how populations of trees will respond to predictable changes in climate and the intensification of extreme weather events such as droughts. The distribution of adaptive traits in seedlings is a crucial component of population adaptive potential and its characterization is important for development of management approaches mitigating the effects of climate change on forests. In this study, we used a large-scale common garden drought experiment to characterize the variation in drought tolerance, growth, and plastic responses to extreme summer drought in seedlings of 73 natural provenances of the two main varieties of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii and var. glauca), sampled across most of their extensive natural ranges. We detected large differences between the two Douglas-fir varieties for all traits assessed, with var. glauca showing higher tolerance to drought but slower height growth and less plasticity than var. menziesii. Surprisingly, signals of local adaptation to drought within varieties were weak within var. glauca and nearly absent within var. menziesii. Temperature-related variables were identified as the main climatic drivers of clinal variation in drought tolerance and height growth species-wide, and in height growth within var. menziesii. Furthermore, our data indicate that higher plasticity under extreme droughts could be maladaptive in var. menziesii. Overall, our study suggests that genetic variation for drought tolerance in seedlings is maintained primarily within rather than among provenances within varieties and does not compromise growth at early stages of plant development. Given these results, assisted gene flow is unlikely to help facilitate adaptation to drought within Douglas-fir varieties, but selective breeding within provenances could accelerate adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Organisms with external fertilization exhibit a variety of reproductive modes, from simple parthenogenesis to isogamy, anisogamy and oogamy. Here, we develop a mathematical model that helps to explain the evolution of these modes through the co-evolution of cell size and fertilization rate. By assuming that gametes can develop parthenogenetically should they fail to fertilize, and that survival of a propagule (zygote/unfertilized gamete) depends on size, we find that an isogamous population can evolve to anisogamy through evolutionary branching. Oogamy can then evolve from an anisogamous population under sexual conflict. Furthermore, we derive analytic results on the model parameters required to arrest evolution on this isogamy-oogamy trajectory. Low fertilization rates stabilise isogamy, while low fertilization costs stabilise anisogamy. Additionally we show using adaptive dynamics that isogamy can be maintained as a bet-hedging strategy in a stochastically switching environment.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=93 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/544312v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a2a272org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1571f02org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b4dccaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b8b94_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIAdapting the classic Parker-Baker-Smith model for the evolution of anisogamy (gametic sex cells of differing sizes), we provide the first analysis of the co-evolution of fertilization rate and gamete cell mass in organisms that can reproduce both sexually and asexually through parthenogenesis.\nC_LIO_LIWe identify a novel mechanism by which oogamy (motile microgametes and sessile macrogametes) can be selected for, arising from sexual conflict between microgametes (sperm) and macrogametes (eggs).\nC_LIO_LIWe identify a novel mechanism by which a state of isogamy (equal sized gametes) can be stabilized under evolution, resulting from a bet-hedging strategy in switching environments.\nC_LIO_LIFor all of the above insights, we develop a mathematical analysis with predictions that are supported by detailed computational simulations.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Quantitative fluorescence microscopy is experiencing an important revolution thanks to single-photon array detectors. These detectors provide users with so far inaccessible specimen information: The distribution of the specimens fluorescence emission at single-photon level and high spatiotemporal sampling. In laser-scanning microscopy, this photon-resolved measurement has enabled robust fluorescence lifetime imaging at sub-diffraction spatial resolution, thus opening new perspectives for structural and functional imaging. Despite these significant advances in imaging, studying the time evolution of biological processes remains a considerable challenge. Here we present a com-prehensive framework of live-cell spectroscopy methodologies - compatible with imaging - to investigate bio-molecular processes at various spatiotemporal scales. We use photon-resolved spatial and temporal measurements granted by a single-photon array detector to boost the information content of a unified fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime experiment. To demonstrate the potential of this approach, we investigate the phase transition of liquid-like condensates during oxidative stress inside living cells. These condensates are generally found in several cellular processes and exhibit substantial variations in molecular composition, size, and kinetics, posing a significant challenge for quantifying their underlying molecular dynamics. This study demonstrates how the pro-posed approach reveals the mutual dynamics of different RNA-binding proteins involved in the stress granules formation - inaccessible to imaging alone. We observe condensate formation by performing time-lapse super-resolved imaging of the cellular macro-environment while simultaneously monitoring the molecular mobility, the sub-diffraction environment organization, interactions, and nano-environment properties through fluorescence lifetime fluctuation spectroscopy. We are confident that our framework offers a versatile toolkit for investigating a broad range of bio-molecular processes - not limited to liquid-liquid phase transition - and we anticipate their widespread application in future life-science research.",

    "abstract": "DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors are FDA-approved for various hematological malignancies but have limited efficacy in solid tumors. DNA hypomethylation with these drugs is associated with elevated lysine 27 tri-methylation on histone H3 (H3K27me3). We hypothesized that this EZH2-dependent repressive mark limits the full potential of DNMT inhibition. Here, we show in cell line and tumoroid models of colorectal cancer, that low-dose DNMT inhibition sensitizes cells to selective EZH2 inhibitors that have limited single agent toxicity, and that EZH2 inhibition enhances DNMT inhibitor-driven molecular and therapeutic effects. Through integrative epigenomic analyses, we reveal that DNMT inhibition induces H3K27me3 accumulation at genomic regions poised with EZH2. Unexpectedly, combined treatment alters the epigenome landscape to promote transcriptional upregulation of the calcium-calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway. Blocking this pathway limits the transcriptional activating effects of the drug combination, including expression of transposable elements and innate immune response genes within a viral defense pathway. Consistently, we demonstrate positive correlations between DNMT inhibitor- and innate immune response-associated transcription profiles and calcium signal activation in primary human colon cancer specimens. Collectively, our study demonstrates that compensatory EZH2 activity following DNA hypomethylation presents a barrier to the therapeutic action of DNMT inhibition in colon cancer, reveals a new application of EZH2 inhibitors beyond cancers associated with PRC2 hyperactivity, and links calcium-calcineurin-NFAT signaling to epigenetic therapy-induced viral mimicry.\n\nHighlightsO_LISelect EZH2 inhibitors enhance the transcriptional activating and antiproliferative effects of DNA hypomethylating agents in colon cancer cells.\nC_LIO_LIThe mechanism involves blockade of H3K27me3 accumulation in regions of the genome poised for PRC2 activity.\nC_LIO_LIDNMT inhibitor + EZH2 inhibitor treatment transcriptionally upregulates calcium-calcineurin- NFAT signaling, and this pathway is necessary for complete induction of viral mimicry and innate immune response pathways.\nC_LIO_LIThe therapeutic utility of EZH2 inhibitors may be extended beyond cancers with PRC2 hyperactivity in combination regimens with DNMT inhibitors.\nC_LI",

Here, we reported that CD301+ macrophages were significantly increased and showed their most active interaction with profibrotic cells in the endometria of IUA patients compared with the normal endometria by single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing and experimental verification. Increasing CD301+ macrophages promoted the differentiation of endometrial stromal cells into myofibroblasts and resulted in extracellular matrix accumulation, which destroyed the physiological architecture of endometrial tissue, drove endometrial fibrosis and ultimately led to female infertility or adverse pregnancy outcomes. Mechanistically, CD301+ macrophages secreted GAS6 to activate the AXL/NF-{kappa}B pathway, up-regulating the profibrotic protein synthesis. Targeted deletion of CD301+ macrophages or inhibition of AXL by Bemcentinib blunted the pathology and improved the outcomes of pregnancy in mice, supporting the therapeutic potential of targeting CD301+ macrophages for treating endometrial fibrosis.",

Through infusion of 13C-labeled metabolites (glucose, glutamine, acetate) in Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)-infected mice, we demonstrate that CD8+ T effector (Teff) cells utilize metabolites for specific pathways during specific phases of activation. Highly proliferative early Teff cells in vivo shunt glucose primarily towards nucleotide synthesis and leverage glutamine anaplerosis in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to support ATP and de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Additionally, early Teff cells rely on glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1 (Got1)--which regulates de novo aspartate synthesis--for effector cell expansion in vivo. Importantly, Teff cells change fuel preference over the course of infection, switching from glutamine-to acetate-dependent TCA cycle metabolism late in infection.

    "abstract": "A central goal of evolutionary developmental biology is to decipher the evolutionary pattern of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that control morphogenesis during embryonic development, and the underlying molecular mechanism of the GRNs evolution. The Nodal signaling that governs the body axes of deuterostomes exhibits a conserved GRN orchestrated principally by Nodal, Gdf1/3 and Lefty. Despite that the GRN retains a conserved function in deuterostomes, the expression patterns of Gdf1/3 and Nodal are derived in cephalochordate amphioxus, implying a specific rewiring of the GRN in this lineage. Here we examined the regulatory mechanism and evolution of this GRN in amphioxus by functional genetic manipulations. We found that while the amphioxus Gdf1/3 orthologue shows nearly no expression during embryogenesis, its duplicate Gdf1/3-like linking to Lefty is zygotically expressed in a similar pattern as Lefty. Mutant and transgenic analyses revealed that Gdf1/3 is no longer crucial for amphioxus axial development. Instead, Gdf1/3-like assumes this responsibility, likely through hijacking Lefty enhancers. We also showed that amphioxus Nodal has become an indispensable maternal factor to compensate for the loss of maternal Gdf1/3 expression. We therefore demonstrated a case that the evolution of an ancestral GRN could be triggered by enhancer hijacking events. This pivotal event has allowed the emergence of a new GRN in the extant amphioxus, presumably evolving through a stepwise process. The co-expression of Gdf1/3-like and Lefty achieved by shared regulatory region may have provided developmental robustness during body axis formation in extant amphioxus, which provides a selection-based hypothesis for the phenomena called developmental system drift.",

Bats under stressful conditions, for example when confronted by a predator, will emit aggressive social calls. The presentation of aggressive social calls, including distress calls (DCs), is known to increase heart rate (HR), but how this change in HR is related to the bats sound perception and how this evokes behaviors such as the fear response is unknown. Herein, we show that the perception of a distress context induces freezing behavior as a fear response in bats. We found that bats responded by freezing and displayed increased HRs when they were presented with a conspecific donor bat in a distress situation evoked by gentle poking with a cotton swab. In addition, when we presented two types of auditory oddball paradigms with different probabilities of DCs and echolocation calls (ECs), the bats HRs increased when DCs were presented as deviant or control stimuli within standard ECs but did not increase when DCs were presented as standard stimuli. These results suggest that the situational context created by the frequency of sound presentation, rather than simply a single sound feature, induces HR increases and freezing as fear responses in bats.\n\nSummary statementWe investigated the electrocardiograms of captive Pipistrellus abramus and found that their heart rate increased as a fear response when the bats heard sounds with a distress context.",

    "abstract": "The Calcium Sensing Receptor (CaSR) is very important in controlling the levels of calcium in the body by interacting with different types of G-protein. This receptor is highly conserved among other G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and has been linked to disorders affecting the balance of calcium in the body, such as hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia. Although there has been progress in understanding the structure and function of CaSR, there is still a lack of knowledge about which specific residues are important for their function and how it differs from other receptors in the same class. In this study, we used phylogeny-based methods to identify functionally-equivalent orthologs of CaSR, predict the importance of each residue, and calculate specificity-determining position (SDP) scores to uncover the evolutionary basis of its function. Our results showed that the CaSR subfamily is highly conserved, with higher SDP scores than its closest receptor subfamilies. Residues with high SDP scores are likely to be critical in receptor activation and pathogenicity. We applied gradient-boosting trees with evolutionary metrics as inputs to predict the functional consequences of each substitution, and discriminate between gain and loss-of-function mutations those causing hypo- and hypercalcemia, respectively. Our study provides insight into the evolutionary fine-tuning of CaSR, which can help understand its role in calcium balance and related disorders.",

    "abstract": "The major resistance gene BvCR4 recently bred into sugar beets provides a high level of resistance to Cercospora leaf spot caused by the fungal pathogen Cercospora beticola. The occurrence of pathogen strains virulent to BvCR4 was studied using field trials in Switzerland and Germany. Virulence of a subset of these strains was tested in a field trial conducted under elevated artificial disease pressure. We created a new C. beticola reference genome and mapped whole genome sequences of 256 field-collected isolates and combined this with the virulence phenotypes to conduct three separate GWAS to identify candidate avirulence genes. GWAS analyses identified a locus associated with avirulence containing a single candidate avirulence effector gene named AvrCR4. All virulent isolates either lacked AvrCR4 or had non-synonymous mutations within the gene. AvrCR4 was present in all 74 unique isolates obtained from non-BvCR4 hybrids, whereas 33 of 89 unique isolates obtained from BvCR4 hybrids carried this deletion. We also mapped genomic data from 190 publicly available isolates from the U.S to our new reference genome. The AvrCR4 deletion was found in only one of 95 unique isolates from non-BvCR4 hybrids in the U.S. AvrCR4 presents a unique example of an avirulence effector in which virulent alleles have only recently emerged. Most likely these were selected out of the standing genetic variation after deployment of a new major resistance gene. Identification of AvrCR4 will enable real-time screening of C. beticola populations for the emergence and spread of virulent isolates as well as long-term studies of effector evolution.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlcohol consumption may impact and shape brain development through perturbed biological pathways and impaired molecular functions. We investigated the relationship between alcohol consumption rates and neuron-enriched exosomal microRNA (miRNA) expression to better understand the impact of alcohol use on early life brain biology.\n\nMethodsNeuron-enriched exosomal miRNA expression was measured from plasma samples collected from young people using a commercially available microarray platform while alcohol consumption was measured using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Linear regression and network analyses were used to identify significantly differentially expressed miRNAs and to characterize the implicated biological pathways, respectively.\n\nResultsCompared to alcohol naive controls, young people reporting high alcohol consumption exhibited significantly higher expression of four neuron-enriched exosomal miRNAs including miR-30a-5p, miR-194-5p, and miR-339-3p, although only miR-30a-5p and miR-194-5p survived multiple test correction. The miRNA-miRNA interaction network inferred by a network inference algorithm did not detect any differentially expressed miRNAs with a high cutoff on edge scores. However, when the cutoff of the algorithm was reduced, five miRNAs were identified as interacting with miR-194-5p and miR-30a-5p. These seven miRNAs were associated with 25 biological functions; miR-194-5p was the most highly connected node and was highly correlated with the other miRNAs in this cluster.\n\nConclusionsOur observed association between neuron-enriched exosomal miRNAs and alcohol consumption concurs with results from experimental animal models of alcohol use and suggests that high rates of alcohol consumption during the adolescent/young adult years may impact brain functioning and development by modulating miRNA expression.",

    "abstract": "Endozoicomonadaceae bacteria are widespread in many marine animals, and generally considered beneficial. Members of one clade, however, Candidatus Endonucleobacter, infect the nuclei of deep-sea mussels, where they replicate to [&ge;] 80,000 bacteria per nucleus and cause the nuclei to swell to 50 times their original size. How these parasites are able to persist in host nuclei without the cell undergoing apoptosis is not known. We show here that Ca. Endonucleobacter encodes and expresses 7-15 inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs), proteins previously only known from animals and viruses. Dual RNA-seq transcriptomes of infected nuclei revealed parallel upregulation of Ca. Endonucleobacter IAPs and host caspases, suggesting an arms race between the parasite and host for control of apoptosis. Comparative phylogenetic analyses revealed that Ca. Endonucleobacter acquired IAPs repeatedly through horizontal gene transfer from their hosts in convergent acquisition, possibly mediated by herpes viruses that may infect both the parasite and the host.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a highly prevalent neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Patients exhibit broad genetic, molecular, and clinical diversity involving mild to severe comorbidities. The factors that contribute to this phenotypic diversity remain unclear. We used publicly available datasets to systematically interrogate the expression pattern of 247 epilepsy-associated genes across human tissues, developmental stages, and central nervous system (CNS) cellular subtypes. We grouped genes based on their curated phenotypes into 3 broad classes: core epilepsy genes (CEG), where seizures are the core syndrome, developmental and epileptic encephalopathy genes (DEEG) that are associated with developmental delay, and seizure-related genes (SRG), which are characterized by developmental delay and gross brain malformations. We find that DEEGs are highly expressed within the CNS, while SRGs are most abundant in non-CNS tissues. DEEGs and CEGs exhibit highly dynamic expression in various brain regions across development, spiking during the prenatal to infancy transition. Lastly, the abundance of CEGs and SRGs is comparable within cellular subtypes in the brain, while the average expression level of DEEGs is significantly higher in GABAergic neurons and non-neuronal cells. Our analysis provides an overview of the expression pattern of epilepsy-associated genes with spatiotemporal resolution and establishes a broad expression-phenotype correlation in epilepsy.",
