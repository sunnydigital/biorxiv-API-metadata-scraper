    "abstract": "Recent developments in both computational analysis and data-driven synthesis enable a new era of automated reasoning with logical models (Boolean networks in particular) in systems biology. However, these advancements also motivate an increased focus on quality control and performance comparisons between tools.\n\nAt the moment, to illustrate real-world applicability, authors typically test their approaches on small sets of manually curated models that are inherently limited in scope. This further complicates reuse and comparisons, because benchmark models often contain ad hoc modifications or are outright not available.\n\nIn this paper, we describe a new, comprehensive, open source dataset of 210+ Boolean network models compiled from available databases and a literature survey. The models are available in a wide range of formats. Furthermore, the dataset is accompanied by a validation pipeline that ensures the integrity and logical consistency of each model. Using this pipeline, we identified and repaired 400+ potential problems in a number of widely used models.",

    "abstract": "Bimanual coordination modes, namely in-phase and anti-phase, represent two distinct movement patterns characterized by simultaneous & symmetrical movements of both hands and alternating complementary actions, respectively. These coordination modes are integral in various activities, such as playing musical instruments, typing, and participating in sports that demand precise hand-eye coordination. The objective of the present experiment was to investigate the impact of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) targeting the left supplementary motor area (lSMA) on bimanual coordination during in/anti-phase coordination modes. To explore this, we utilized a steady-state system of coordination dynamics and evaluated the continuous relative phase ({phi}) and variability of relative phase (SD{phi}) during cued and non-cued trials in both pre- and post-transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) conditions. The results revealed that visual cues (cued trials) significantly enhanced bimanual coordination performance in both in/anti-phase coordination modes. However, contrary to expectations, the downregulation of lSMA through cTBS did not lead to significant disruptions in movement during in/anti-phase bimanual coordination in pre- and post-TMS stimulation. Potential factors for the lack of observed effects include methodological limitations, individual differences, and functional redundancy within the motor system. Further research is needed to optimize stimulation parameters, increase sample sizes, and explore the interactions between the lSMA, and other brain regions involved in motor control to gain a comprehensive understanding of the contributions of the lSMA in bimanual coordination.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation and neuronal loss are key factors in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. It is known that activation of Dual Leucine Zipper Kinase (DLK) in chronic neurodegenerative diseases causes neuron death and axon degeneration through apoptotic pathways. Genetic deletion of DLK (dual leucine zipper kinase, MAP3K12) or pharmacological inhibition by GNE-3511 or GNE-8505 was found to have benefits in mouse models of Alzheimers and ALS; however, there is no previous study that uses DLK inhibitors in epilepsy models. Therefore, the aim of our study is to suppress the DLK/JNK pathway with the DLK inhibitor GNE-3511 in the temporal lobe epilepsy model induced by pilocarpine and to determine the effect of this inhibition on cognitive and behavioural defects, as well as epileptogenesis. Open field, elevated plus maze, and Morris water maze tests were used to assess locomotor activity, anxiety and learning and memory, respectively. Following decapitation the hippocampi were removed and, histopathological and biochemical analyses were performed. Both treatment groups had less anxiety and locomotor activity as well as decreased impairment in memory and learning performance compared to SE group (p<0.001). Both doses of GNE-3511 prevented the spontaneous recurrent seizures in a dose dependent manner with respect to the SE group (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). Histological examination of the hippocampus revealed a neuroprotective effect of both doses of treatment in the CA1 area and dentate gyrus (p<0.0001). Thus, DLK inhibitor GNE-3511 was found to be effective in preventing epileptogenesis, neuronal loss and cognitive and behavioural deficits due to pilocarpine induced SE.",

    "abstract": "The basal breast cancer subtype is enriched for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and displays consistent large chromosomal deletions. Here, we characterize the evolution and maintenance of chromosome 4p (chr4p) loss in basal breast cancer. TCGA data analysis showed recurrent deletion of chr4p in basal breast cancer. Phylogenetic analysis of a unique panel of 23 primary tumor/patient-derived xenograft basal breast cancer revealed early evolution of chr4p deletion. Chr4p loss is associated with enhanced proliferation and immune evasion. We characterized an unknown gene, C4orf19, within chr4p, which suppressed proliferation when overexpressed and is a member of a novel PDCD10-GCKIII kinase module, and we refer to it as PGCA1. Genome-wide pooled overexpression screens using a barcoded library of human open reading frames, identified chromosomal regions, including chr4p, that suppress proliferation when overexpressed in a context-dependent manner. Together this sheds light on the early emergence of complex aneuploid karyotypes involving chr4p and adaptive landscapes shaping breast cancer genomes.",

    "abstract": "We introduce CoRE-BED, a framework trained using 19 epigenomic features encompassing 33 major cell and tissue types to predict cell-type-specific regulatory function. CoRE-BEDs interpretability facilitates causal inference and functional prioritization. CoRE-BED identifies nine functional classes de-novo, capturing both known and completely new regulatory categories. Notably, we describe a previously uncharacterized class termed Development Associated Elements (DAEs), which are highly enriched in stem-like cell types and distinguished by dual presence of either H3K4me2 and H3K9ac or H3K79me3 and H4K20me1. Unlike bivalent promoters, which represent a transitory state between active and silenced promoters, DAEs transition directly to or from a non-functional state during stem cell differentiation and are proximal to highly expressed genes. Across 70 GWAS traits, SNPs disrupting CoRE-BED elements explain nearly all SNP heritability, despite encompassing a fraction of all SNPs. Notably, we provide evidence that DAEs are implicated in neurodegeneration. Collectively, our results show CoRE-BED is an effective prioritization tool for post-GWAS analysis.",

    "abstract": "Distinguishing reality from hallucinations requires efficient monitoring of agency. It has been hypothesized that a copy of motor signals, termed efference copy (EC) or corollary discharge (CD), suppresses sensory responses to yield the sense of agency; impairment of the inhibitory function leads to hallucinations. However, how can the sole absence of inhibition yield positive symptoms of hallucinations? We hypothesize that selective impairments in functionally distinct signals of CD and EC during motor-to-sensory transformation cause the positive symptoms of hallucinations. In an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment with a delayed articulation paradigm in schizophrenic patients with (AVHs) and without auditory verbal hallucinations (non-AVHs), we found that preparing to speak without knowing the contents (general preparation) did not suppress auditory responses in both patient groups, suggesting the absent of inhibitory function of CD. Whereas, preparing to speak a syllable (specific preparation) enhanced the auditory responses to the prepared syllable in non-AVHs, whereas AVHs showed enhancement in responses to unprepared syllables, opposite to the observations in the normal population, suggesting that the enhancement function of EC is not precise in AVHs. A computational model with a virtual lesion of an inhibitory inter-neuron and disproportional sensitization of auditory cortices fitted the empirical data and further quantified the distinct impairments in motor-to-sensory transformation in AVHs. These results suggest that  broken CD plus  noisy EC causes erroneous monitoring on the imprecise generation of internal auditory representation and yields auditory hallucinations. Specific impairments in functional granularity of motor-to-sensory transformation mediate positivity symptoms of agency abnormality in mental disorders.",

Here we investigated if microglia nodules in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) of multiple sclerosis (MS) are different from microglia nodules in white matter (WM) in stroke and whether they may relate to the start of demyelinating MS lesions. We studied the relation between microglia nodules and pathological severity in an MS autopsy cohort (n=167), and we compared frequency, size, and gene expression of microglia nodules in MS (n=7) and stroke (n=7). MS donors with microglia nodules (64%) had a higher lesion load and a higher proportion of active lesions compared to donors without microglia nodules (36%). We found altered expression of genes in microglia nodules in MS compared to stroke, including genes previously shown to be upregulated in MS lesions. Genes associated with lipid metabolism, presence and proliferation of T and B cells, production of and response to immunoglobulins and cytokines (specifically TNF and IFN), activation of the complement cascade, and metabolic stress were upregulated. Using immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that in MS, more than in stroke, microglia nodules are associated with membrane attack complexes, have phagocytosed oxidized phospholipids, and have a tubular mitochondrial network reflecting increased metabolic activity. Furthermore, in MS, some nodules encapsulated partially demyelinated axons. Taken together, we propose that activation of some microglia nodules in MS by pro-inflammatory cytokines and immunoglobulins in combination with phagocytosis of oxidized phospholipids may lead to a volatile phenotype prone to form MS lesions.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-27, a member of the IL-12 family of cytokines, induces human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-resistant monocyte-derived macrophages and T cells. This resistance is mediated via the downregulation of spectrin beta, non-erythrocytic 1 (SPTBN1), induction of autophagy, or suppression of the acetylation of Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1); however, the role of IL-27 administration during the induction of immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (iDC) is poorly investigated. In the current study, we investigated the function of IL-27-induced iDC (27DC) on HIV infection. 27DC inhibited HIV infection by 95 {+/-} 3 % without significant changes in the expression of CD4, CCR5, and SPTBN1 expression, autophagy induction and acetylation of YB-1 compared to iDC. An HIV proviral DNA copy number assay displayed that 27DC suppressed reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction without influencing the virus entry. A DNA microarray analysis was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes between 27DC and iDC. Compared to iDC, 51 genes were differentially expressed in 27DC, with more than 3-fold changes in four independent donors. Cross-reference analysis with the reported 2,214 HIV regulatory host genes identified nine genes as potential interests: Ankyrin repeat domain 22, Guanylate binding protein (GBP)-1, -2, -4, -5, Stabilin 1, Serpin family G member 1 (SERPING1), Interferon alpha inducible protein 6, and Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3. A knock-down study using si-RNA failed to determine a key factor associated with the anti-HIV activity due to the induction of robust amounts of off-target effects. Overexpression of each protein in cells had no impact on HIV infection. Thus, we could not define the mechanism of the anti-HIV effect in 27DC. However, our findings indicated that IL-27 differentiates monocytes into HIV-resistant DC, and the inhibitory mechanism differs from IL-27-induced HIV-resistant macrophages and T cells.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundImmune response of triatomines plays an important role in the success or failure of transmission of T. cruzi. Studies on parasite-vector interaction have shown the presence of trypanolytic factors and have been observed to be differentially expressed among triatomines, which affects the transmission of some T. cruzi strains or DTUs (Discrete Typing Units).\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsTrypanolytic factors were detected in the hemolymph and saliva of R. prolixus against epimastigotes and trypomastigotes of T. cruzi II. To identify the components of the immune response that could be involved in this lytic activity, a comparative proteomic analysis was carried out, detecting 120 proteins in the hemolymph of R. prolixus and 107 in R. colombiensis. In salivary glands, 1103 proteins were detected in R. prolixus and 853 in R. colombiensis. A higher relative abundance of lysozyme, prolixin, nitrophorins, and serpin as immune response proteins was detected in the hemolymph of R. prolixus. Among the R. prolixus salivary proteins, a higher relative abundance of nitrophorins, lipocalins, and triabins was detected. The higher relative abundance of these immune factors in R. prolixus supports their participation in the lytic activity on T. cruzi II, but not on T. cruzi I, which is resistant to lysis by hemolymph and salivary proteins of R. prolixus due to mechanisms of evading oxidative stress caused by immune factors.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceT. cruzi I is a DTU distributed from the southern United States to the center of Chile and Argentina, and its successful spread across this range could be related to resistance to oxidative stress in vectors. Future proteomic and transcriptomic studies on vectors and the interactions of the intestinal microbiota with parasites will help to confirm the determinants of successful or failed vector transmission of T. cruzi DTUs in different parts of the Western Hemisphere.\n\nAuthor summarySome factors can facilitate or prevent T. cruzi transmission, i.e. vector immunity. Our work has managed to detect a stronger immune response against T. cruzi II in R. prolixus saliva and haemolymph, compared to that of R. colombiensis. Proteins from both species saliva and haemolymph were analysed for studying factors which might have been involved in such response; most proteins were detected in both species haemolymph, thereby indicating common immune mechanisms. Three proteins having oxidative immune activity were only expressed in R. prolixus. Lipocalin diversity and abundance predominated in R. prolixus saliva; these proteins are involved in nitric oxide metabolism and their role in immunity could be key in host defence against T. cruzi. Recognising the components modulating parasite transmission in a vector helps in understanding how such factors act independently and how they would act synergistically against T. cruzi, thereby enabling us to establish tools regarding Chagas disease epidemiology, aimed at predicting T. cruzi distribution and creating transmission control mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Systemic infections can yield distinct outcomes in different tissues. In mice, intravenous inoculation of E. coli leads to bacterial replication within liver abscesses while other organs such as the spleen largely clear the pathogen. Abscesses are macroscopic necrotic regions that comprise the vast majority of the bacterial burden in the animal, yet little is known about the processes underlying their formation. Here, we characterize E. coli liver abscesses and identify host determinants of abscess susceptibility. Spatial transcriptomics revealed that liver abscesses are associated with heterogenous immune cell clusters comprised of macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, innate lymphoid cells, and T-cells that surround necrotic regions of the liver. Susceptibility to liver abscesses is heightened in the C57BL/6 lineage, particularly in C57BL/6N females. Backcross analyses demonstrated that abscess susceptibility is a polygenic trait inherited in a sex-dependent manner without direct linkage to sex chromosomes. As early as one day post infection, the magnitude of E. coli replication in the liver distinguishes abscess-susceptible and abscess-resistant strains of mice, suggesting that the immune pathways that regulate abscess formation are induced within hours. We characterized the early hepatic response with single-cell RNA sequencing and found that mice with reduced activation of early inflammatory responses, such as those lacking the LPS receptor TLR4, are resistant to abscess formation. Experiments with barcoded E. coli revealed that TLR4 mediates a tradeoff between abscess formation and bacterial clearance. Together, our findings define hallmarks of E. coli liver abscess formation and suggest that hyperactivation of the hepatic innate immune response drives liver abscess susceptibility.\n\nImportanceAnimal models of disseminating bacterial infections are critical for developing therapeutic interventions. Following systemic dissemination in mice, E. coli undergo dramatic replication within abscesses in the liver but not in other organs. Although liver abscesses are the largest reservoir of bacteria within the animal, the processes that lead to abscess formation are not known. Here, we characterize E. coli liver abscess formation and identify several determinants of abscess susceptibility, including sex, mouse genotype, and innate immune factors. By combining spatial and single-cell transcriptomics with genetic and phenotypic analyses, we delineate critical host pathways that underlie abscess formation. Our findings define several avenues for future studies to unravel how abscess susceptibility determinants interact to modulate clearance of systemic infections and govern tissue-specific bacterial replication.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a novel integrated process: the oxygen-induced thiosulfate production during Sulfate reduction, Autotrophic denitrification, NItrification and Anammox (SANIA) integrated process, targeting to treat mainstream wastewater after organics capture. Three moving-bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) were applied for oxygen-induced thiosulfate production during sulfate reduction, mixed sulfide- and thiosulfate-driven partial denitrification and anammox (MSPDA), and nitrification (N), respectively. This study firstly established SANIA with supply of mimic nitrifying effluent to investigated the development of MSPDA (Period I) and subsequently verified SANIA in mainstream condition with implementation of nitrification (Period II). In Period I, the MSPDA-MBBR fed with ERATO-MBBR and mimic nitrifying effluent, was operated for over 300 days. Without inoculation of anammox biomass, the high rates of denitratation and anammox being 2.7 gN/(m2{middle dot}d) and 2.8 gN/(m2{middle dot}d), respectively were developed in the bioreactor with the enrichment of anammox bacteria and the coexistence of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Batch tests were performed to explore the bioconversion of sulfur and nitrogen compounds in MSPDA with main findings as following: 1) kinetics and pathways of sulfide (S2-  S0  SO42-) and thiosulfate (S2 O32-  SO42-) oxidation were revealed; 2) fast denitrification was achieved during oxidation of sulfide and thiosulfate to S0 and sulfate, respectively with sufficient nitrite accumulation, supporting the high activity of anammox; 3) nitrite utilization rate of anammox (50.8 mgN/(m2{middle dot}h)) is higher than sulfur-driven denitritation (12.9-42.6 mgN/(m2{middle dot}h)), demonstrating the dominance of anammox in nitrogen removal. In Period II, the N-MBBR was set behind MSPDA-MBBR to supply nitrate by recirculation, thus the SANIA system was developed. Afterwards the integrated SANIA system with a short HRT of 4.7 h was continuously operated for over 130 days. Results demonstrated that 90% of COD, 93% of ammonium and 61% of TIN were removed with concentration of COD, ammonium, and TIN below 10 mg/L, 3 mgN/L and 13 mgN/L, respectively in effluent.

    "abstract": "The occurrence of regeneration of the organs involved in respiratory gas exchange amongst vertebrates is heterogeneous. In aquatic animals, such as amphibians and fishes, the gills regenerate completely following resection or amputation; whereas in mammals, only partial, facultative regeneration of lung tissue occurs following injury. Given the homology between gills and lungs, the capacity of gill regeneration in aquatic species is of major interest in determining the underlying molecular or signalling pathways involved in respiratory organ regeneration. In the present study, we used adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) to characterize signalling pathways involved in the early stages of gill regeneration. Regeneration of the gills, including the gas exchange surfaces, was induced by resection of the gill filaments and observed over a period of up to 10 days. We screened for the effects of the drugs, SU5402, dorsomorphin, and LY411575, which inhibit FGF, BMP or Notch signalling, respectively, on development of the blastema. Exposure to each drug for 5 days significantly reduced blastema formation in regenerates, compared to unresected controls. In separate experiments, and under normal conditions of regeneration, we used quantitative real-time PCR and observed an increased expression of genes encoding for the bone morphogenetic factor, Bmp2b, fibroblast growth factor, Fgf8a, a transcriptional regulator (Her6) involved in Notch signalling, and Sonic Hedgehog (Shha), in regenerating gills at 10 day post-resection, compared to unresected controls. In situ hybridization confirmed that all four genes were expressed in regenerating gill tissue. This study implicates BMP, FGF, Notch and Shh signalling in gill regeneration in zebrafish.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTGill regeneration in zebrafish is mediated by multiple signalling pathways, including BMP, FGF, Notch and Sonic Hedgehog.",

A recent in vitro analysis of bleb formation using a cancer cell line showed that store-operated calcium entry (SOCE)-mediated local elevation of Ca2+ concentration triggers bleb formation, but it remains unknown how commonly this system is utilized in the bleb formation and bleb-driven cell migration in vivo. We demonstrate with avian primordial germ cell (PGC) model that that chick PGCs use SOCE, triggered by stem cell factor (SCF), to induce bleb formation and that it is essential for in vivo migration including trans-endothelial and mesenchymal cell migration.

    "abstract": "ModularImageAnalysis (MIA) is an ImageJ plugin providing a code-free graphical environment in which complex automated analysis workflows can be constructed and distributed. The near 200 included modules cover all stages of a typical analysis workflow, from image loading through image processing, object detection, extraction of measurements, measurement-based filtering, visualisation, and data exporting. MIA provides out-of-the-box compatibility with many advanced image processing plugins for ImageJ including Bio-Formats, DeepImageJ, MorphoLibJ and TrackMate, allowing these tools and their outputs to be directly incorporated into analysis workflows. By default, modules support spatially calibrated 5D images, meaning measurements can be acquired in both pixel and calibrated units. A hierarchical object relationship model allows for both parent-child (one-to-many) and partner (many-to-many) relationships to be established. These relationships underpin MIAs ability to track objects through time, represent complex spatial relationships (e.g. skeletons) and measure object distributions (e.g. count puncta per cell). MIA features dual graphical interfaces: the \"editing view\" offers access to the full list of modules and parameters in the workflow, while the simplified \"processing view\" can be configured to display only a focused subset of controls. All workflows are batch-enabled by default, with image files within a specified folder being processed automatically and exported to a single spreadsheet. Beyond the included modules, functionality can be extended both internally, through integration with the ImageJ scripting interface, and externally, by developing third-party Java modules that extend the core MIA framework. Here we describe the design and functionality of MIA in the context of a series of real-world example analyses.",

Despite intensive treatment, 5-year survival for patients with advanced disease remains low (<30%), highlighting a need for novel therapies to improve outcomes. Differentiation therapeutics are agents that induce differentiation of cancer cells from malignant to benign. The histone methyltransferase, Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) suppresses normal skeletal muscle differentiation and is highly expressed in RMS tumors. We demonstrate combining EZH2 inhibition with the differentiating agent retinoic acid (RA) is more effective at reducing cell proliferation in RMS cell lines than single agents alone. In PAX3 -FOXO1 positive RMS cells this is due to an RA-driven induction of the interferon pathway resulting in apoptosis. In fusion negative RMS, combination therapy led to an EZH2i-driven upregulation of myogenic signaling resulting in differentiation. These results provide insight into the mechanism that drives the anti-cancer effect of the EZH2/RA single agent and combination treatment and indicate that the reduction of EZH2 activity combined with the induction of RA signalling represents a potential novel therapeutic strategy to treat both subtypes of RMS.\n\nHighlightsO_LIEZH2 expression is upregulated fusion positive (FPRMS) and fusion negative (FNRMS) rhabdomyosarcomas\nC_LIO_LIEZH2 inhibition combined with retinoic acid treatment was investigated RMS cell models.\nC_LIO_LICombination treatment reduced cell proliferation and tumor spheroid volume.\nC_LIO_LICombination treatment in FPRMS resulted in apoptosis in FPRMS via interferon signaling.\nC_LIO_LIConversely, combination treatment in fusion negative RMS resulted in myogenic differentiation.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp)-binding integrins v{beta}6 and v{beta}8 are clinically validated cancer and fibrosis targets of considerable therapeutic importance. Compounds that can discriminate between the two closely related integrin proteins and other RGD integrins, stabilize specific conformational states, and have sufficient stability enabling tissue restricted administration could have considerable therapeutic utility. Existing small molecules and antibody inhibitors do not have all of these properties, and hence there is a need for new approaches. Here we describe a method for computationally designing hyperstable RGD-containing miniproteins that are highly selective for a single RGD integrin heterodimer and conformational state, and use this strategy to design inhibitors of v{beta}6 and v{beta}8 with high selectivity. The v{beta}6 and v{beta}8 inhibitors have picomolar affinities for their targets, and >1000-fold selectivity over other RGD integrins. CryoEM structures are within 0.6-0.7[A] root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) to the computational design models; the designed v{beta}6 inhibitor and native ligand stabilize the open conformation in contrast to the therapeutic anti-v{beta}6 antibody BG00011 that stabilizes the bent-closed conformation and caused on-target toxicity in patients with lung fibrosis, and the v{beta}8 inhibitor maintains the constitutively fixed extended-closed v{beta}8 conformation. In a mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, the v{beta}6 inhibitor potently reduced fibrotic burden and improved overall lung mechanics when delivered via oropharyngeal administration mimicking inhalation, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of de novo designed integrin binding proteins with high selectivity.",

Combining phenyl/hexyl-C18 separations using 2.1 mm inner diameter LC columns and triple quadrupole mass spectrometry, identification and quantification were secured with negligible variance in retention time and quantifier/qualifier ratios, negligible levels of carry-over (< 2%), and sufficient precision ({+/-} 10% RSD) and accuracy ({+/-} 15% relative error) with and without use of internal standard. The here developed RPLC-MS/MS method showed that the SC-islets have an insulin response dependent on glucose concentration, and the SC-islets produce and release somatostatin-14 and glucagon. The RPLC-MS/MS method for these peptide hormones was compatible with an unfiltered off-line sample collection from SC-islets cultivated on a pump-less, recirculating organ-on-chip (rOoC) platform. The SC-islets background secretion of insulin was not significantly different on the rOoC device compared to a standard cell culture well-plate. Taken together, RPLC-MS/MS is well suited for multi-hormone measurements of SC-islets on an organ-on-chip platform.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal development orchestrates the formation of an enormous number of synapses that connect the nervous system. In developing presynapses, the core active zone structure has been found to assemble through a liquid-liquid phase separation. Here, we find that the phase separation of SYD-2/Liprin-, a key active zone scaffold, is controlled by phosphorylation. Using phosphoproteomics, we identify the SAD-1 kinase to phosphorylate SYD-2 and a number of other substrates. Presynaptic assembly is impaired in sad-1 mutants and increased by overactivation of SAD-1. We determine SAD-1 phosphorylation of SYD-2 at three sites is critical to activate its phase separation. Mechanistically, phosphorylation relieves a binding interaction between two folded SYD-2 domains that inhibits phase separation by an intrinsically disordered region. We find synaptic cell adhesion molecules localize SAD-1 to nascent synapses upstream of active zone formation. We conclude that SAD-1 phosphorylates SYD-2 at developing synapses, enabling its phase separation and active zone assembly.",

Despite the economic importance of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), research on its skin bacteriome composition is still missing. To date, most studies on the composition of fish skin bacteriome have used amplicon sequencing, despite the limitations associated with this method. In our study, a shotgun metagenomic approach was applied to characterize the external mucus bacteriome of 8 carp specimens from two different ponds on a fish farm in Hungary. Besides the carp samples, water was also sequenced from the two corresponding ponds. Each carp skin sample was dominated by the phylum Proteobacteria, followed by Actinobacteria, Bacteroidota, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria and Planctomycetota. Additionally, we have found strong concordance between the water and carp skin mucus samples, despite most studies describing an opposite relationship. Furthermore, shotgun metagenomics allowed us to apply functional annotation to the metagenomes, which revealed several metabolic functions. We present, to our knowledge, the first description of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) skin mucus bacteriome. Even though our results showed a high level of host genome contamination, we could still provide valuable insight into the external bacterial community of this species.

    "abstract": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a debilitating, progressive lung disease with few therapeutic options, largely due to a paucity of mechanistic knowledge of disease pathogenesis. Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are known to envelope and invade clusters of LAM-cells, comprising of smooth muscle -actin and/or HMB-45 positive \"smooth muscle-like cells\" however the role of LECs in LAM pathogenesis is still unknown. To address this critical knowledge gap, we investigated wether LECs interact with LAM-cells to augment their metastatic behaviour of LAM-cells. We performed in situ spatialomics and identified a core of transcriptomically related cells within the LAM nodules. Pathway analysis highlights wound and pulmonary healing, VEGF signaling, extracellular matrix/actin cytoskeletal regulating and the HOTAIR regulatory pathway enriched in the LAM Core cells. We developed an organoid co-culture model combining primary LAM-cells with LECs and applied this to evaluate invasion, migration, and the impact of Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor. LAM-LEC organoids had significantly higher extracellular matrix invasion, decreased solidity and a greater perimeter, reflecting increased invasion compared to non-LAM control smooth muscle cells. Sorafenib significantly inhibited this invasion in both LAM spheroids and LAM-LEC organoids compared to their respective controls. We identified TGF{beta}1{iota}1, a molecular adapter coordinating protein-protein interactions at the focal adhesion complex and known to regulate VEGF, TGF{beta} and Wnt signalling, as a Sorafenib-regulated kinase in LAM-cells. In conclusion we have developed a novel 3D co-culture LAM model and have demonstrated the effectiveness of Sorafenib to inhibit LAM-cell invasion, identifying new avenues for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Global warming is causing large-scale disruption of cnidarian-Symbiodiniaceae symbioses fundamental to major marine ecosystems, such as coral reefs. However, the mechanisms by which heat stress perturbs these symbiotic partnerships remain poorly understood. In this context, the upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea has emerged as a powerful experimental model system. We combined a controlled heat stress experiment with isotope labeling and correlative SEM-NanoSIMS imaging to show that host starvation is a central component in the chain of events that ultimately leads to the collapse of the Cassiopea holobiont. Heat stress caused an increase in catabolic activity and a depletion of carbon reserves in the unfed host, concurrent with a reduction in the supply of photosynthates from its algal symbionts. This state of host starvation was accompanied by pronounced in hospite degradation of algal symbionts, which may be a distinct feature of the heat stress response of Cassiopea. Interestingly, this loss of symbionts by degradation was to a large extent concealed by body shrinkage of the starving animals, resulting in what could be referred to as invisible bleaching. Overall, our study highlights the importance of the nutritional status in the heat stress response of the Cassiopea holobiont. Compared with other symbiotic cnidarians, the large mesoglea of Cassiopea, with its structural sugar and protein content, may constitute an energy reservoir capable of delaying starvation. It seems plausible that this anatomical feature at least partly contributes to the relatively high stress tolerance of these animals in our warming oceans.",

    "abstract": "The human MCM8-9 helicase functions in concert with HROB in the context of homologous recombination, but its precise function is unknown. To gain insights into how HROB regulates MCM8-9, we first used molecular modeling and biochemistry to define their interaction interface. We show that HROB makes important contacts with both MCM8 and MCM9 subunits, which directly promotes its DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase activities. MCM8-9-HROB preferentially binds and unwinds branched DNA structures, and single-molecule experiments reveal a low DNA unwinding processivity. MCM8-9 unwinds DNA as a hexameric complex that assembles from dimers on DNA in the presence of ATP, which is prerequisite for its helicase function. The hexamer formation thus involves two repeating protein-protein interfaces forming between the alternating MCM8 and MCM9 subunits. One of these interfaces is rather stable and forms an obligate heterodimer, while the other interface is labile and mediates the assembly of the hexamer on DNA, independently of HROB. The ATPase site composed of the subunits forming the labile interface disproportionally contributes to DNA unwinding. HROB does not affect the MCM8-9 ring formation, but promotes DNA unwinding downstream by possibly coordinating ATP hydrolysis with structural transitions accompanying translocation of MCM8-9 on DNA.",

    "abstract": "Claudins are a family of [~]25 kDa membrane proteins that integrate into tight junctions to form molecular barriers at the paracellular spaces between endothelial and epithelial cells. Humans have 27 subtypes, which homo- and hetero-oligomerize to impart distinct properties and physiological functions to tissues and organs. As the structural and functional backbone of tight junctions, claudins are attractive targets for therapeutics capable of modulating tissue permeability to deliver drugs or treat disease. However, structures of claudins are limited due to their small sizes and physicochemical properties--these traits also make therapy development a challenge. We have developed a synthetic antibody fragment (sFab) that binds human claudin-4 and used it to resolve structures of its complex with Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CpE) using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The resolution of the structures reveals the architectures of 22 kDa claudin-4, the 14 kDa C-terminal domain of CpE, and the mechanism by which this sFab binds claudins. Further, we elucidate the biochemical and biophysical bases of sFab binding and demonstrate that this molecule exhibits subtype-selectivity by assaying homologous claudins. Our results provide a framework for developing sFabs against hard-to-target claudins and establishes the utility of sFabs as fiducial markers for determining cryo-EM structures of this small membrane protein family at resolutions that surpass X-ray crystallography. Taken together, this work highlights the ability of sFabs to elucidate claudin structure and function and posits their potential as therapeutics for modulating tight junctions by targeting specific claudin subtypes.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has the capacity to evolve mutations to escape vaccine-and infection-acquired immunity and antiviral drugs. A variant-agnostic therapeutic agent that protects against severe disease without putting selective pressure on the virus would thus be a valuable biomedical tool. Here, we challenged rhesus macaques with SARS-CoV-2 Delta and simultaneously treated them with aerosolized RBD-62, a protein developed through multiple rounds of in vitro evolution of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to acquire 1000-fold enhanced ACE2 binding affinity. RBD-62 treatment gave equivalent protection in upper and lower airways, a phenomenon not previously observed with clinically approved vaccines. Importantly, RBD-62 did not block the development of memory responses to Delta and did not elicit anti-drug immunity. These data provide proof-of-concept that RBD-62 can prevent severe disease from a highly virulent variant.",

    "abstract": "Many biogeochemical functions involve bacteria utilizing solid substrates. However, little is known about the coordination of bacterial growth with the kinetics of attachment to and detachment from such substrates. In this quantitative study of Vibrio sp. 1A01 growing on chitin particles, we reveal the heterogeneous nature of the exponentially growing culture, comprised of two co-existing subpopulations: a minority replicating on chitin particles and a non-replicating majority which was planktonic. This partition resulted from a high rate of cell detachment from particles. Despite high detachment, sustained exponential growth of cells on particles was enabled by the enrichment of extra-cellular chitinases excreted and left behind by detached cells. The \"inheritance\" of these chitinases sustains the colonizing subpopulation despite its reduced density. This simple mechanism helps to circumvent a tradeoff between growth and dispersal, allowing particle-associated marine heterotrophs to explore new habitats without compromising their fitness on the habitat they have already colonized.",

    "abstract": "In response to luteinizing hormone, multiple proteins in rat and mouse granulosa cells are rapidly dephosphorylated, but the responsible phosphatases remain to be identified. Because the phosphorylation state of phosphatases can regulate their interaction with substrates, we searched for phosphatases that might function in LH signaling by using quantitative phosphomass spectrometry. We identified all proteins in rat ovarian follicles whose phosphorylation state changed detectably in response to a 30-minute exposure to LH, and within this list, identified protein phosphatases or phosphatase regulatory subunits that showed changes in phosphorylation. Phosphatases in the PPP family were of particular interest because of their requirement for dephosphorylating the natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPR2) guanylyl cyclase, which triggers oocyte meiotic resumption. Among the PPP family regulatory subunits, PPP1R12A and PPP2R5D showed the largest increases in phosphorylation, with 4-10 fold increases in signal intensity on several sites. Although follicles from mice in which these phosphorylations were prevented by serine-to-alanine mutations in either Ppp1r12a or Ppp2r5d showed normal LH-induced NPR2 dephosphorylation, these regulatory subunits and others could act redundantly to dephosphorylate NPR2. Our identification of phosphatases and other proteins whose phosphorylation state is rapidly modified by LH provides clues about multiple signaling pathways in ovarian follicles.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/544636v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@407c6eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a9231eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@140ab53org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@afef68_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Summary sentenceMass spectrometric analysis of phosphatases whose phosphorylation state is rapidly modified by luteinizing hormone provides clues about how LH signaling dephosphorylates NPR2 as well as a resource for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) represents the severest form of congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS), a diverse group of inherited disorders characterised by impaired neuromuscular transmission. Most CMS originate from defects in the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, but the underlying molecular pathogenesis is only poorly understood. Here we show that RNAi-mediated silencing of FADS-related proteins rapsyn and NUP88 in foetal fibroblasts alters organisation of the actin cytoskeleton. We show that fibroblasts from two independent FADS individuals have enhanced and shorter actin stress fibre bundles, alongside with an increased number and size of focal adhesions, with an otherwise normal overall connectivity and integrity of the actin-myosin cytoskeleton network. By proximity ligation assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation, we show that rapsyn and NUP88 localise nearby adhesion plaques and that they interact with the focal adhesion protein paxillin. Based on these findings we propose that a respective deficiency in rapsyn and NUP88 in FADS alters the regulation of actin dynamics at focal adhesions, and thereby may also plausibly dictate myofibril organisation and contraction in skeletal muscle of FADS individuals.",

    "abstract": "Allotopic expression is the term given for the deliberate relocation of gene function from an organellar genome to the nuclear genome. We hypothesized that the allotopic expression of an essential mitochondrial gene using a promoter that expressed efficiently in all cell types except those responsible for male reproduction would yield a cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) phenotype once the endogenous mitochondrial gene was inactivated via genome editing. To test this, we repurposed the mitochondrially encoded atp1 gene of tobacco to function in the nucleus under the transcriptional control of a CaMV 35S promoter (construct 35S:nATP1), a promoter that has been shown to be minimally expressed in early stages of anther development. The endogenous atp1 gene was eliminated ({Delta}atp1) from 35S:nATP1 tobacco plants using custom-designed meganucleases directed to the mitochondria. Vegetative growth of most 35S:nATP1/{Delta}atp1 plants appeared normal, but upon flowering produced malformed anthers that failed to shed pollen. When 35S:nATP1/{Delta}atp1 plants were cross-pollinated, ovary/capsule development appeared normal, but the vast majority of the resultant seeds were small, largely hollow and failed to germinate, a phenotype akin to the seedless trait known as stenospermocarpy. Characterization of the mitochondrial genomes from three independent {Delta}atp1 events suggested that spontaneous recombination over regions of microhomology and substoichiometric shifting were the mechanisms responsible for atp1 elimination and genome rearrangement in response to exposure to the atp1-targeting meganucleases. Should the results reported here in tobacco prove to be translatable to other crop species, then multiple applications of allotopic expression of an essential mitochondrial gene followed by its elimination through genome editing can be envisaged. Depending on the promoter(s) used to drive the allotopic gene, this technology may have potential application in the areas of: (1) CMS trait development for use in hybrid seed production; (2) seedless fruit production; and (3) transgene containment.",

    "abstract": "The rhizosphere microbiome plays a crucial role in supporting plant productivity and contributes to ecosystem functioning by regulating nutrient cycling, soil integrity, and carbon storage. However, characterizing their functional attributes and microbial relationships remains challenging due to their complex taxonomic and functional compositions. To enable such studies, the development of reduced complexity microbial consortia derived from the rhizosphere microbiome of the natural ecosystem is highly desirable. Designing and assembling reduced complexity consortia that mimic natural communities with consistent, stable, predictable features are highly sought after but is challenging to deliver. Here we present our systematic controlled design towards successful assembly of several such rhizosphere derived reduced complexity consortia. From Brachypodium grown in natural soil under controlled lab conditions, we enriched the root-associated microbes, utilizing carbon compounds prevalent in Brachypodium root exudates. By transferring the enrichments every 3 or 7 days for 9 generations, we developed both fast and slow-growing microbial communities. 16S rRNA amplicon analysis revealed that both inoculum and carbon substrates significantly influence microbial community composition. For example, 1/10 R2A preferentially enriched Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) from slow growing taxa vital to plant including Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. Network analysis revealed that although fast and slow growing microbial consortia have distinct key taxa, the key hubs (keystone taxa) for both belong to genera with plant growth promoting (PGP) traits. This suggests that PGP bacteria might play a central role in controlling the microbial networks among rhizospheric microbiomes. Based on the stability and richness results from different transfers, most carbon substrates lead to microbial consortia with reduced complexity and high stability after a few transfers. The stability tests of the derived microbial consortia also showed high stability, reproducibility, and revivability of the constructed microbial consortia. Our study represents a significant step towards understanding and harnessing the potential of rhizosphere microbiomes, with implications for sustainable agriculture and environmental management.",

Differences in bacterial diversity were significantly correlated with differences in specific climate factors, topsoil characteristics, and supplemental diets provided by farmers. Microbiota clustered into 3 enterotypes, with one particularly enriched at high altitudes. We assembled 9,977 taxonomically and functionally diverse metagenome-assembled genomes, the vast majority of which were not found in a dataset of previously published chicken microbes, or in the Genome Taxonomy Database. The wide functional and taxonomic diversity of these microbes highlights their importance in the local adaptation of indigenous poultry, and the significant impacts of environmental factors on the microbiota argues for further discoveries in other agro-ecologies.",

Fluke EVs are actively internalized by host cholangiocytes in the bile ducts, where they drive pathology and promote neoplasia through induction of cellular proliferation and secretion of inflammatory cytokines. We investigated the effects of tetraspanins of the CD63 superfamily by co-culturing recombinant forms of the large extracellular loop (LEL) of O. viverrini tetraspanin-2 (rLEL-Ov-TSP-2) and tetraspanin-3 (rLEL-Ov-TSP-3) with non-cancerous human bile duct (H69) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA, M213) cell lines. The results showed that cell lines co-cultured with excretory/secretory products from adult O. viverrini (Ov-ES) underwent significantly increased cell proliferation at 48 hours but not 24 hours compared to untreated control cells (P<0.05), whereas rLEL-Ov-TSP-3 co-culture resulted in significantly increased cell proliferation at both 24 hr (P<0.05) and 48 hr (P<0.01) time points. In like fashion, H69 cholangiocytes co-cultured with both Ov-ES and rLEL-Ov-TSP-3 underwent significantly elevated Il-6 and Il-8 gene expression for at least one of the time points assessed. Finally, both rLEL-Ov-TSP-and rLEL-Ov-TSP-3 significantly enhanced migration of both M213 and H69 cell lines. These findings indicated that O. viverrini CD63 family tetraspanins can promote a cancerous microenvironment by enhancing innate immune responses and migration of biliary epithelial cells.",

    "abstract": "Eph receptor tyrosine kinases participate in a variety of normal and pathogenic processes during development and throughout adulthood. This versatility is likely facilitated by the ability of Eph receptors to signal through diverse cellular signalling pathways: primarily by controlling cytoskeletal dynamics, but also by regulating cellular growth, proliferation, and survival. Despite many proteins linked to these signalling pathways interacting with Eph receptors, the specific mechanisms behind such links and their coordination remain to be elucidated. In a proteomics screen for novel EPHB2 multi-effector proteins, we identified human MYC binding protein 2 (MYCBP2 or PAM or Phr1). MYCBP2 is a large signalling hub involved in diverse processes such as neuronal connectivity, synaptic growth, cell division, neuronal survival, and protein ubiquitination. Our biochemical experiments demonstrate that the formation of a complex containing EPHB2 and MYCBP2 is facilitated by FBXO45, a protein known to select substrates for MYCBP2 ubiquitin ligase activity. Formation of the MYCBP2-EPHB2 complex does not require EPHB2 tyrosine kinase activity and is destabilised by binding of ephrin-B ligands, suggesting that the MYCBP2-EPHB2 association is a prelude to EPHB2 signalling. Paradoxically, the loss of MYCBP2 results in increased ubiquitination of EPHB2 and a decrease of its protein levels suggesting that MYCBP2 stabilises EPHB2. Commensurate with this effect, our cellular experiments reveal that MYCBP2 is essential for efficient EPHB2 signalling responses in cell lines and primary neurons. Finally, our genetic studies in C. elegans provide in vivo evidence that the ephrin receptor VAB-1 displays genetic interactions with known MYCBP2 binding proteins. Together, our results align with the similarity of neurodevelopmental phenotypes caused by MYCBP2 and EPHB2 loss of function, and couple EPHB2 to a signaling effector that controls diverse cellular functions.",

Quantitation of plasma PvLDH has been used as a measure of P. vivax biomass in clinical studies of uncomplicated and severe vivax malaria. With the increasing importance of PvLDH in studying P. vivax diagnosis and infection, improved characterisation of the dynamics of this biomarker is important. In this study, we developed mathematical models that capture parasite and matrix PvLDH dynamics in ex vivo culture and the human host. We estimated the biological parameters using ex vivo and in vivo longitudinal data of parasitemia and PvLDH concentration collected from P. vivax-infected humans using Bayesian hierarchical inference. We found that the ex vivo and in vivo estimates of PvLDH in a parasitized red blood cell differed significantly across the asexual life cycle, with in vivo estimates at least ten-fold higher than ex vivo estimates (for example, the median estimate of intraerythrocytic PvLDH mass at the end of the life cycle was 9.4x10-3 ng in vivo vs. 5.1x10-4 ng ex vivo). We also estimated the ex vivo PvLDH half-life to be 65.3 h (95% credible interval: 60.8--70.7 h), which is approximately three times longer than the median estimate of the in vivo PvLDH half-life, 21.9 h (16.7--29.9 h).

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic both relied and placed significant burdens on the experts involved from research and public health sectors. The sustained high pressure of a pandemic on responders, such as healthcare workers, can lead to lasting psychological impacts including acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, burnout, and moral injury, which can impact individual wellbeing and productivity. As members of the infectious disease modelling community, we convened a reflective workshop to understand the professional and personal impacts of response work on our community and to propose recommendations for future epidemic responses. The attendees represented a range of career stages, institutions, and disciplines. This piece was collectively produced by those present at the session based on our collective experiences. Key issues we identified at the workshop were lack of institutional support, insecure contracts, unequal credit and recognition, and mental health impacts. Our recommendations include rewarding impactful work, fostering academia-public health collaboration, decreasing dependence on key individuals by developing teams, increasing transparency in decision-making, and implementing sustainable work practices. Despite limitations in representation, this workshop provided valuable insights into the UK COVID-19 modelling experience and guidance for future public health crises. Recognising and addressing the issues highlighted is crucial, in our view, for ensuring the effectiveness of epidemic response work in the future.",

    "abstract": "Why individuals with Down Syndrome (DS, trisomy 21) are particularly susceptible to SARS CoV-2 induced neuropathology remains largely unclear. Since the choroid plexus (CP) performs important barrier and immune-interface functions, secretes the cerebrospinal fluid and strongly expresses the ACE2 receptor and the chromosome 21 encoded TMPRSS2 protease, we hypothesized that the CP could play a role in establishing SARS-CoV-2 infection in the brain. To investigate the role of the choroid plexus in SARS-CoV-2 central nervous system infection in DS, we established a new type of brain organoid from DS and isogenic euploid control iPSC that consists of a core of appropriately patterned functional cortical neuronal cell types that is surrounded by a patent and functional choroid plexus (CPCOs). Remarkably, DS-CPCOs not only recapitulated abnormal features of DS cortical development but also revealed defects in ciliogenesis and epithelial cell polarity of the developing choroid plexus. We next demonstrate that the choroid plexus layer facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication and infection of cortical neuronal cells, and that this is increased in DS-CPCOs. We further show that inhibition of TMPRSS2 and Furin activity inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in DS CPCOs to the level observed in euploid organoids. We conclude that CPCOs are a useful model for dissecting the role of the choroid plexus in euploid and DS forebrain development and enables screening for therapeutics that can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 induced neuro-pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe nasal microbiota is a key contributor to animal health, and characterizing the nasal microbiota composition is an important step towards elucidating the role of its different members. Efforts to characterize the nasal microbiota composition of domestic pigs and other farm animals frequently report the presence of bacteria that are typically found in the gut, including many anaerobes from the Bacteroidales and Clostridiales orders. However, the in vivo role of these gut-microbiota associated taxa is currently unclear. Here, we tackled this issue by examining the prevalence, origin, and activity of these taxa in the nasal microbiota of piglets.\n\nResultsFirst, analysis of the nasal microbiota of farm piglets sampled in this study, as well as various publicly available data sets, revealed that gut-microbiota associated taxa indeed constitute a substantial fraction of the pig nasal microbiota that is highly variable across individual animals. Second, comparison of herd-matched nasal and rectal samples at amplicon sequencing variant (ASV) level showed that these taxa are largely shared in the nasal and rectal microbiota, suggesting a common origin driven presumably by the transfer of fecal matter. Third, surgical sampling of the inner nasal tract showed that gut-microbiota associated taxa are found throughout the nasal cavity, indicating that these taxa do not stem from contaminations introduced during sampling with conventional nasal swabs. Finally, analysis of cDNA from the 16S rRNA gene in these nasal samples indicated that gut-microbiota associated taxa are indeed active in the pig nasal cavity.\n\nConclusionThis study shows that gut-microbiota associated taxa are not only present, but also active, in the nasal cavity of domestic pigs, and paves the way for future efforts to elucidate the in vivo function of these taxa within the nasal microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Regenerative abilities are extremely variable among animals and may be substantial in some phyla, such as the annelids. So far, the cellular mechanisms underlying regeneration in annelids remain elusive. To precisely determine the origin(s), plasticity and fate of the cells participating in the blastema formation during posterior regeneration in the annelid Platynereis dumerilii, we developed specific tools to track proliferative cells as well as gut epithelial cells. We showed that two populations of progenitors are at play during regeneration and that, among them, gut progenitors from differentiated tissues are lineage-restricted. Strikingly, gut progenitors from less differentiated and more proliferative tissues are much more plastic and can produce ectodermal and mesodermal derivatives, in addition to gut cells. However, their plasticity is de facto limited as exemplified by their inability to regenerate populations of stem cells responsible for the constant growth of the worms. We evidenced that those stem cells are from local origin (i.e. from the segment abutting the amputation plan) as most of the blastema cells. Our results are in favour of a hybrid and flexible cellular model for posterior regeneration in Platynereis relying on a gradient of cell plasticity along the antero-posterior axis of the animal.",

    "abstract": "Thermal variability can render corals stress resistant through a phenomenon coined as \"stress-hardening induced by environmental priming\". Fluctuations that involve high temperature peaks have been commonly investigated, however, the effects of a stress-hardening stimulus generated by cold-water pulses has rarely been studied. Offshore island reefs in the Andaman Sea offer an ideal natural setting to study these effects, as cooling water of internal waves induce strong variability with peak intensity in January to June and absence in August to November. While western island shores are exposed to this stimulus, eastern shores remain sheltered. This study examined (1) whether corals from exposed reefs were more heat stress resistant compared to stimulus-sheltered conspecifics and (2) whether this trait can last in the absence of the stimulus. We quantified the thermal stress resistance in two ecologically important coral species, Pocillopora sp. and Porites sp., from the two island shores, during the two seasons. Coral bleaching intensity and photosynthetic efficiency of algal symbionts were measured as response variables after a short-term heat stress assay (24-48 h, 34 {degrees}C) to assess thermal stress resistance. Stress responses of all stimulus-exposed corals were either undetectable (during the season of stimulus presence) or very weak (during stimulus absence), while corals from the stimulus-sheltered shore responded strongly to heat stress irrespective of the season. Hence, thermal resistance was overall greater in corals originating from the stimulus-exposed shore, but it was slightly diminished during the season of stimulus absence, emphasizing the relevance of stimulus recurrence in maintaining the resistance trait. We exemplify that the stimulus of fluctuating low temperature pulses successfully induced stress-hardening in corals. This suggests that priming stimuli do not necessarily need to transgress certain upper thermal thresholds, but can also touch on lower thresholds to be effective. Even more, we argue that cooling pulses might represent a safer stress-hardening regime, since warming-stress accumulation can be avoided. More research is required to obtain a better understanding of environmental priming, but current findings should encourage the development of artificial stress-hardening approaches to enhance coral resistance in reef restoration efforts.",

    "abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) are a widely used cell system and a foundation for cell therapy. Differences in gene expression, DNA methylation, and chromatin conformation, which have the potential to affect differentiation capacity, have been identified between iPSCs and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Less is known about whether DNA replication timing - a process linked to both genome regulation and genome stability - is efficiently reprogrammed to the embryonic state. To answer this, we profiled and compared genome-wide replication timing between ESCs, iPSCs, and cells reprogrammed by somatic cell nuclear transfer (NT-ESCs). While NT-ESCs replicated their DNA in a manner indistinguishable from ESCs, a subset of iPSCs exhibit delayed replication at heterochromatic regions containing genes downregulated in iPSC with incompletely reprogrammed DNA methylation. DNA replication delays were not the result of gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations and persisted after differentiating cells to neuronal precursors. Thus, DNA replication timing can be resistant to reprogramming and lead to undesirable phenotypes in iPSCs, establishing it as an important genomic feature to consider when evaluating iPSC lines.",

We present EMMA (Extending Multiple alignments using MAFFT--add) for the problem of adding a set of unaligned sequences into a multiple sequence alignment (i.e., a constraint alignment). EMMA builds on MAFFT--add, which is also designed to add sequences into a given constraint alignment. EMMA improves on MAFFT--add methods by using a divide-and-conquer framework to scale its most accurate version, MAFFT-linsi--add, to backbone alignments with many sequences. We show that EMMA has an accuracy advantage over other techniques for adding sequences into alignments under many realistic conditions and can scale to large datasets with high accuracy (hundreds of thousands of sequences).

    "abstract": "Functional MRI (fMRI) has been instrumental in understanding how cognitive processes are spatially mapped in the brain, yielding insights about brain regions and functions. However, in case the orthogonality of behavioral or stimulus timing is not guaranteed, the estimated brain maps fail to dissociate each cognitive process, and the resultant maps become unstable. Also, the brain mapping exercise can not provide temporal information on the cognitive process. Here we propose a qualitatively different approach to fMRI analysis, named Cognitive Dynamics Estimation (CDE), that estimates how multiple cognitive processes change over time even when behavior or stimulus logs are unavailable. This method transposes the conventional brain mapping; the brain activity pattern at each time point is subject to regression analysis with data-driven maps of cognitive processes as regressors, resulting in the time series of cognitive processes. The estimated time series captured the fluctuation of intensity and timing of cognitive processes on a trial-by-trial basis, which conventional analysis could not capture. Notably, the estimated time series predicted participants cognitive ability to perform each psychological task. As an addition to our fMRI analytic toolkit, these results suggest the potential for CDE to elucidate underexplored cognitive phenomena, especially in the temporal domain.\n\nHighlightsWe propose a novel fMRI analysis that are equivalently effective to the brain mapping approach\n\nThe temporal dynamics of multiple cognitive processes were captured on a trial-by-trial basis.\n\nThis analysis can be applied data-driven even when the researchers do not have any hypothesis about what kind of cognitive processes are recruited in the task.\n\nThis analysis can be applied even when the cognitive processes are strongly correlated in the temporal domain.\n\nThe estimated temporal dynamics well predicted individuals cognitive ability required for each task.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDisrupted proteostasis is an emerging area of research into major depressive disorder. Several proteins have been implicated as specifically forming aggregates in the brains of subsets of patients with psychiatric illnesses, these proteins include CRMP1, DISC1, NPAS3 and TRIOBP-1. It is unclear, however, whether these normally aggregate together in the same individuals, and, if so, whether each protein aggregates independently of each other (\"parallel aggregation\") or if the proteins physically interact and aggregate together (\"co-aggregation\").\n\nMaterials and methodsPost mortem insular cortex samples from major depressive disorder and Alzheimers disease patients, suicide victims and control individuals had their insoluble fractions isolated and tested by Western blotting to determine which of these proteins are insoluble, and therefore likely aggregating. The ability of the proteins to co-aggregate (directly interact and form common aggregate structures) was tested by systematic pairwise expression in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, examined by immunofluorescent microscopy.\n\nResultsMany individuals displayed multiple insoluble proteins in the brain, although not enough to imply interaction between the proteins. Cell culture analysis revealed that only a few of the proteins analyzed can consistently co-aggregate with each other: DISC1 with CRMP1 and TRIOBP-1. DISC1 was able to induce aggregation of full length TRIOBP-1, but not its domains expressed individually.\n\nConclusionsWhile specific proteins are capable of co-aggregating, and appear to do so in the brains of individuals with mental illness, and potentially also with suicidal tendency, it is more common for such proteins to aggregate in a parallel manner, through independent mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesInvestigating protein-DNA interactions is imperative to understanding fundamental concepts such as cell growth, differentiation, and cell development in many systems. Sequencing techniques such as ChIP-seq can yield genome-wide DNA binding profiles of transcription factors; however this assay can be expensive, time-consuming, may not be informative for repetitive regions of the genome, and depend heavily upon antibody suitability. Combining DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with immunofluorescence (IF) is a quicker and inexpensive approach which has historically been used to investigate protein-DNA interactions in individual nuclei. However, these assays are sometimes incompatible due to the required denaturation step in DNA FISH that can alter protein epitopes, hindering primary antibody binding. Additionally, combining DNA FISH with IF may be challenging for less experienced trainees. Our goal was to develop an alternative technique to investigate protein-DNA interactions by combining RNA FISH with IF.\n\nResultsWe developed a hybrid RNA FISH and IF protocol for use on Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosome spreads in order to visualize colocalization of proteins and DNA loci. We demonstrate that this assay is sensitive enough to determine if our protein of interest, Multi-sex combs (Mxc), localizes to single-copy target transgenes carrying histone genes. Overall, this study provides an alternative, accessible method for investigating protein-DNA interactions at the single gene level in Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes.",

Dysregulation of adrenocortical cell differentiation alters the proportion and organization of the functional zones of the adrenal cortex leading to disease.

This study aimed to investigate the centripetal differentiation model in the human adrenal cortex and characterize aldosterone-producing micronodules (APMs) to better understand adrenal diseases such as primary aldosteronism. We applied spatially resolved in situ transcriptomics to human adrenal tissue sections from two individuals and identified distinct cell populations and their positional relationships. The results supported the centripetal differentiation model in humans, with cells progressing from the outer capsule to the zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata, and zona reticularis. Additionally, we characterized two APMs in a 72-year-old female. Comparison with earlier APM transcriptomes indicated a subset of core genes, but also heterogeneity between APMs. The findings contribute to our understanding of normal and pathological cellular differentiation in the human adrenal cortex.",

    "abstract": "A key component of parental care is avoiding killing and eating your own offspring. Many organisms commit infanticide but switch to parental care at the time when their own offspring would be expected, known as temporal kin recognition. It is unclear how such indirect kin recognition is so common across taxa. One possibility is that temporal kin recognition can be achieved by altering a simple mechanism, such as co-opting the regulation of timing and feeding in other contexts. Here we determine whether takeout, a gene implicated in coordinating feeding, influences temporal kin recognition in the roundneck sexton beetle, Nicrophorus orbicollis. We find that takeout expression is not associated with non-parental feeding changes resulting from hunger, or in the general switch to the full parental care repertoire. However, beetles that accepted and provided care to their offspring had a higher takeout expression than beetles that committed infanticide. Together, these data support the idea that the evolution of temporal kin recognition may be enabled by co-option of mechanisms that integrate feeding behaviour in other contexts.",

Here we show that undulation emerges if neurons are subject to smooth brainwave oscillations while a cusp results from non-differentiable fluctuations. While modern analysis methods have achieved good connectivity estimation by adapting the models to slow undulation, they still make false inferences due to the cusp.

    "abstract": "The ability to respond quickly to changing environmental conditions in the host is critical for bacterial pathogens. Penicillin-binding protein and serine/threonine-associated (PASTA) kinases are a conserved family of kinases important for cell envelope stress responses in Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, including the cytosolic pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. As serine/threonine kinases, PASTA kinases phosphorylate multiple substrates, yet the mechanisms through which these substrates promote resistance to cell wall stress remain poorly understood. We previously identified GpsB as a target of PrkA, the PASTA kinase in L. monocytogenes, through a phosphoproteomics screen. Here, we demonstrate that GpsB can be directly phosphorylated by PrkA, and that mutation of the PrkA-dependent phosphosite T88 to a phosphoablative residue enhances PrkA activity in vitro. We find that relative to a strain of L. monocytogenes harboring the gpsBT88A allele, a strain with the phosphomimetic gpsBT88D allele is more sensitive to the cephalosporin antibiotic ceftriaxone and has a diminished capacity to increase peptidoglycan synthesis during stress. We find that GpsB-dependent control of PrkA activity is required for optimal survival and replication of L. monocytogenes in the macrophage cytosol. Finally, we show that GpsB is required for full virulence of L. monocytogenes, due in part to its role in modulating PrkA activity. Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that phosphorylative feedback between GpsB and PrkA is important for the ability of L. monocytogenes to respond to cell wall stress, survive in its cytosolic niche, and cause infection.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWAccurate species identification is essential to mammalogy. Despite this necessity, rapid and accurate identification of cryptic, understudied, and elusive mammals remains challenging. Traditional barcoding of mitochondrial genes is standard for molecular identification but requires time-consuming wet-lab methodologies. Recent bioinformatic advancements for nanopore sequencing data offer exciting opportunities for non-invasive and field-based identification of mammals. Nanopore adaptive sampling (NAS), a PCR-free method, selectively sequences regions of DNA according to user-specified reference databases. Here, we utilized NAS to enrich mammalian mitochondrial genome sequencing to identify species. Fecal DNA extractions were sequenced from nine mammals, several collected in collaboration with Minnesota Tribal Nations, to demonstrate utility for NAS-barcoding of non-invasive samples. By mapping to the entire National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) mammalian mitochondrial reference genome database and bioinformatically analyzing highly similar matches, we successfully produced species identifications for all of our fecal samples. Eight of nine species identifications matched previous PCR or animal/fecal morphological identifications. For the ninth species, our genetic data indicate a misidentification stemming from the original study. Our approach has a range of applications, particularly field-based wildlife research, conservation, disease surveillance, and monitoring of wildlife trade. Of importance to Minnesota tribes is invasive species monitoring, detections, and confirmation as climate impacts causes changes in biodiversity and shifts in species distributions. The rapid assessment techniques described here will be useful as new introductions and range expansions of native and invasive species may first be detected by the presence of signs such as scat rather than direct observations and will be helpful for chronically understaffed tribal natural resources agencies.",

Here, we explored the functional role of the Bacillus subtilis siderophore bacillibactin in an antagonistic interaction with Pseudomonas marginalis. The presence of bacillibactin strongly influenced the outcome of the interaction in an iron-dependent manner. The bacillibactin producer B. subtilis restricts colony spreading of P. marginalis by repressing the transcription of histidine kinase-encoding gene gacS, thereby abolishing production of secondary metabolites such as pyoverdine and viscosin. By contrast, lack of bacillibactin restricted B. subtilis colony growth in a mechanism reminiscent of a siderophore tug-of-war for iron. Our analysis revealed that the Bacillus-Pseudomonas interaction is conserved across fluorescent Pseudomonas spp., expanding our understanding of the interplay between two genera of the most well-studied soil microbes.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance in M. tuberculosis exclusively originates from chromosomal mutations, either during normal DNA replication or under stress, when the expression of error-prone DNA polymerases increases to repair damaged DNA. The mechanisms by which polymerases switch at the replication fork are unknown. Here, we discover that a mutation in the nucleoid-associated protein, Lsr2, produces several hallmarks of an impaired DNA damage response, including a severe growth defect when exposed to genotoxic drugs and reduced mutation frequency. Lsr2s function as a transcription factor cannot explain these phenotypes. Instead, through a series of genetic and fluorescence imaging experiments, we find that Lsr2 is important for modulating the dynamics of polymerases at the replication fork. The major replicative DNA polymerase, DnaE1, exchanges more frequently in the presence of Lsr2, while, during DNA damage, cells lacking lsr2 cannot effectively load the complex needed to bypass DNA lesions, and thus replicate with higher fidelity but exhibit growth defects. Together, our results show that Lrs2 promotes dynamic flexibility of the mycobacterial replisome, which is critical for robust cell growth and lesion repair in conditions that damage DNA.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is a continuing global health crisis. Identifying the evolutionary trajectories leading to increased antimicrobial resistance can be critical to the discovery of biomarkers for clinical diagnostics and new targets for drug discovery. While the combination of patient data and in vitro experimental evolution has been remarkably successful in extending our understanding of antimicrobial resistance, it can be difficult for in vitro methods to recapitulate the spatial structure and consequent microenvironments that characterize in vivo infection. Notably, in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, changes to either the PmrA/PmrB or PhoP/PhoQ two-component systems have been identified as critical drivers for high levels of colistin and polymyxin resistance. When using microfluidic emulsions to provide spatially structured, low-competition environments, we found that adaptive mutations to phoQ were more successful than pmrB in increasing colistin resistance. Conversely, mutations to pmrB were readily identified using well-mixed unstructured cultures. We found that oxygen concentration gradients within the microdroplet emulsions favored adaptive changes to the PhoP/PhoQ pathway consistent with microaerobic conditions that can be found in the lungs of CF patients. We also observed mutations linked to hallmark adaptations to the CF lung environment, such as loss of motility (fleQ, fliC, fleS, flg, flh, and fleQ) and loss of O antigen biosynthesis (wbpL). Mutation to wbpL, in addition to causing loss of O antigen, was additionally shown to confer moderately increased colistin resistance. Taken together, our data suggest that distinct evolutionary trajectories to colistin resistance may be shaped by the microaerobic partitioning and spatial separation imposed within the CF lung.\n\nImportanceAntibiotic resistance remains one of the great challenges confronting public health in the world today. Individuals with compromised immune systems or underlying health conditions are often at an increased for bacterial infections. Patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) produce thick mucus that clogs airways and provides a very favorable environment for infection by bacteria that further decrease lung function and, ultimately, mortality. CF patients are often infected by bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa early in life and experience a series of chronic infections that, over time, become increasingly difficult to treat due to increased antibiotic resistance. Colistin is a major antibiotic used to treat CF patients. Clinical and laboratory studies have identified PmrA/PmrB and PhoP/PhoQ as responsible for increased resistance to colistin. Both have been identified in CF patient lungs, but why, in some cases, is it one and not the other? In this study, we show that distinct evolutionary trajectories to colistin resistance may be favored by the microaerobic partitioning found within the damaged CF lung.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the growth of formate dehydrogenase-lacking acetogen on formate as sole carbon source. Here, we analyzed formate metabolism in Clostridium bovifaecis strain BXX using different concentrations of formate. The results show that C. bovifaecis converted formate (11.5-96 mM) into acetate with molar ratio of 2.0:1[~]2.6:1 by using L-cysteine in the anaerobic medium as electron source according to the stoichiometry of acetogenesis. Genome analysis of C. bovifaecis revealed genes encoding anaerobic ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase (nrdD and nrdG) catalyzing the oxidation of formate to CO2 while ATP is being reduced to the desoxy form. The existence of nrdD was verified by PCR, reverse transcription-PCR analysis and acetogenesis from formate. The process mode of acetogenesis from formate in C. bovifaecis provides insight into the unique metabolic feature of an FDH-lacking acetogen.\n\nIMPORTANCEWood-Ljungdahl pathway (WLP) lacking formate dehydrogenase (FDH) which catalyzes CO2 reduction to formate has been reported to occur acetogenesis only in the presence of formate and exogenous CO2, which seems to result from the formate-rich habitats adaptation of gastrointestinal acetogens. Here, we found FDH-lacking Clostridium bovifaecis strain BXX converted formate (11.5-96 mM) into acetate with molar ratio of 2.0:1[~]2.6:1 fitting the stoichiometry of acetogenesis when using formate as the sole carbon source. CO2 needed in the carbonyl branch of WLP was from the oxidation of formate to CO2 catalyzed by anaerobic ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase while ATP is being reduced to the desoxy form. L-cysteine in the anaerobic medium was the electron source of WLP. The process mode of acetogenesis from formate in C. bovifaecis provides insight into how an FDH-lacking acetogen can make a living from the simplest resources as carbon source, which has both ecological and biotechnological significance.",

    "abstract": "Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae multi-omic studies have unveiled the function of many proteins, several with elusive functions remain to be fully understood. Based on available platforms of mitochondrial proteome and expression studies, we selected the yeast ORF YDL157c for further characterization. In the meantime, the same ORF was identified by other groups using a machine learning approach as required for mitochondrial translation and it was renamed as DMO2. Dmo2p is a homolog to human DMAC1; it contains conserved cysteines in a Cx2C motif and was previously detected in the peroxisome and in the mitochondrial proteome. Our work discloses Dmo2p as a new factor required for the stabilization of a newly translated mitochondrial product Cox2p, the subunit two of the cytochrome c oxidase complex. Three pieces of evidence have led us to this conclusion: first, elevated instability of newly translated Cox2p in the dmo2 null mutant; second, Dmo2p pulled down components of Cox2p maturation and metalation processes such as Sco1p, Sco2p, and Cox2p itself; and third, expression of DMO2 in multicopy plasmids led to phenotypic suppression of the cox23 mutant that has impaired copper traffic to COX metalation. Moreover, we also observed several phenotypes in dmo2 mutants that indicate a general function of Dmo2p in cellular stress response; the null mutant did not grow on oleate medium, it is more sensitive to heat and oxidative stress, while its overexpression confers resistance to the tested oxidants.",
