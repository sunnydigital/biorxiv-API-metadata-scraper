    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a muco-obstructive lung disease where inflammatory responses due to chronic infection result in the accumulation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the airways. NETs are web-like complexes comprised mainly of decondensed chromatin that function to capture and kill bacteria. Prior studies have established excess release of NETs in CF airways increases viscoelasticity of mucus secretions and reduces mucociliary clearance. Despite the pivotal role of NETs in CF disease pathogenesis, current in vitro models of this disease do not account for their contribution. Motivated by this, we developed a new approach to study the pathobiological effects of NETs in CF by combining synthetic NET-like biomaterials, composed of DNA and histones, with an in vitro human airway epithelial cell culture model. To determine the impact of synthetic NETs on airway clearance function, we incorporated synthetic NETs into mucin hydrogels and cell culture derived airway mucus to assess their rheological and transport properties. We found that the addition of synthetic NETs significantly increases mucin hydrogel and native mucus viscoelasticity. As a result, mucociliary transport in vitro was significantly reduced with the addition of mucus containing synthetic NETs. Given the prevalence of bacterial infection in the CF lung, we also evaluated the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mucus with or without synthetic NETs. We found mucus containing synthetic NETs promoted microcolony growth and prolonged bacterial survival. Together, this work establishes a new biomaterial enabled approach to study innate immunity mediated airway dysfunction in CF.",

    "abstract": "Most biomolecular systems are dependent on a complex interplay of forces. Modern force spectroscopy techniques provide means of interrogating these forces. These techniques, however, are not optimized for studies in constrained or crowded environments as they typically require micron-scale beads in the case of magnetic or optical tweezers, or direct attachment to a cantilever in the case of atomic force microscopy. We implement a nanoscale force-sensing device using a DNA origami which is highly customizable in geometry, functionalization, and mechanical properties. The device, referred to as the NanoDyn, functions as a binary (open or closed) force sensor that undergoes a structural transition under an external force. The transition force is tuned with minor alterations of 1 to 3 DNA oligonucleotides and spans tens of picoNewtons (pN). This actuation of the NanoDyn is reversible and the design parameters strongly influence the efficiency of resetting the initial state, with higher stability devices ({gtrsim}10 pN) resetting more reliably during repeated force-loading cycles. Finally, we show that the opening force can be adjusted in real time by the addition of a single DNA oligonucleotide. These results establish the NanoDyn as a versatile force sensor and provide fundamental insights into how design parameters modulate mechanical and dynamic properties.",

    "abstract": "Designing binders to target undruggable proteins presents a formidable challenge in drug discovery, requiring innovative approaches to overcome the lack of putative binding sites. Recently, generative models have been trained to design binding proteins from the three-dimensional structure of a target protein alone, but thus exclude design to disordered or conformationally unstable targets. In this work, we provide a generalizable algorithmic framework to design short, target-binding peptide motifs, requiring only the amino acid sequence of the target protein. To do this, we propose a process to generate naturalistic peptide candidates through Gaussian perturbation of the peptidic latent space of the state-of-the-art ESM-2 protein language model, and subsequently screen these de novo linear sequences for target-selective interaction activity via a CLIP-based contrastive learning architecture. By integrating these generative and discriminative steps, we create a Peptide Prioritization via CLIP (PepPrCLIP) pipeline and validate highly-ranked, target-specific peptide motifs experimentally via fusion to E3 ubiquitin ligase domains, demonstrating functionally potent degradation of conventionally undruggable targets in vitro. Overall, our design strategy provides a modular toolkit for designing short binding motifs to any target protein without the reliance on stable and ordered tertiary structure, enabling generation of programmable modulators to undruggable and disordered proteins such as transcription factors and fusion oncoproteins.",

Even though ST dataset provides information on the gene expression and its location for each sample, it is challenging to compare spatial gene expression patterns across tissue samples with different shapes and coordinates. Here, we propose a method that reconstructs ST data into multi-dimensional image matrices to ensure comparability across different samples through spatial registration process. We demonstrated the applicability of this method by using two mouse brain ST datasets to investigate and directly compare gene expression in a specific anatomical region of interest, pixel by pixel, across various biological statuses. It can produce statistical parametric maps to find specific regions with differentially expressed genes across tissue samples. Our approach provides an efficient way to analyze ST datasets and may offer detailed insights into various biological conditions.",

    "abstract": "The SLC4 family of secondary bicarbonate transporters is responsible for the transport of HCO3-, CO32-, Cl-, Na+, K+, NH3 and H+ necessary for regulation of pH and ion homeostasis. They are widely expressed in numerous tissues throughout the body and function in different cell types with different membrane properties. Potential lipid roles in SLC4 function have been reported in experimental studies, focusing mostly on two members of the family: AE1 (Cl-/HCO3- exchanger) and NBCe1 (Na+-CO32- cotransporter). Previous computational studies of the outward facing (OF) state of AE1 with model lipid membranes revealed enhanced protein-lipid interactions between cholesterol (CHOL) and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2). However, the protein-lipid interactions in other members of the family and other conformation states are still poorly understood and this precludes the detailed studies of a potential regulatory role for lipids in the SLC4 family. In this work, we performed multiple 50 {micro}s coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations on three members of the SLC4 family with different transport modes: AE1, NBCe1 and NDCBE (a Na+-CO32-/Cl- exchanger), in model HEK293 membranes consisting of CHOL, PIP2, phosphatidylcholine (POPC), phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), phosphatidylserine (POPS), and sphingomyelin (POSM). The recently resolved inward-facing (IF) state of AE1 was also included in the simulations. Lipid-protein contact analysis of the simulated trajectories was performed with the ProLint server, which provides a multitude of visualization tools for illustration of areas of enhanced lipid-protein contact and identification of putative lipid binding sites within the protein matrix. We observed enrichment of CHOL and PIP2 around all proteins with subtle differences in their distribution depending on the protein type and conformation state. Putative binding sites were identified for CHOL, PIP2, POPC, and POSM in the three studied proteins and their potential roles in the SLC4 transport function, conformational transition and protein dimerization were discussed.\n\nStatement of significanceThe SLC4 protein family is involved in critical physiological processes like pH and blood pressure regulation and maintenance of ion homeostasis. Its members can be found in various tissues. A number of studies suggest possible lipid regulation of the SLC4 function. However, the protein-lipid interactions in the SLC4 family are still poorly understood. Here we make use of long coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to assess the protein-lipid interactions in three SLC4 proteins with different transport modes, AE1, NBCe1, and NDCBE. We identify putative lipid binding sites for several lipid types of potential mechanistic importance, discuss them in the framework of the known experimental data and provide a necessary basis for further studies on lipid regulation of SLC4 function.",

    "abstract": "Standard SMLM facilitates the reconstruction of super-resolution map (both location and localization precision) of the target single molecules. In fact, single molecule data does provide information related to the orientation of single molecules, which can be derived from the knowledge of PSF shape and its direction. This information is vital to probe the sub-domain of macromolecules that undergo orientation and conformational changes and provides essential clues on their catalytic activity. Accessing this information in real-time opens up a powerful new window to look into the link between the orientation of macromolecules and the output function. Here, we decode the orientation of single molecules from the knowledge of PSF shape and its direction. The method is primarily based on field-dipole interaction and the fact that the distribution of emitted photons strongly depends on the orientation of the dipole (fluorophore) with respect to the polarization of light. Accordingly, the photon emission from the specimen and the resultant PSF distribution model is developed. Computational studies show changes in the shape and orientation of the recorded PSF (in the image / detector plane). Specifically, a set of three distinct distributions (Gaussian, bivariate-Gaussian and skewed-Gaussian) are recognized from the study, apart from a superset of all possible (a total of 16) distributions. Experiments were conducted on Dendra2-Actin and Dendra2-HA transfected cells that validate the emission model. We report a localization precision of[~] 20 nm and an orientation precision of {+/-}5{degrees}. In addition, the distinct orientation of single molecules is noted for Actin and HA in a cell (Influenza type-A model). Further analysis suggests a preferred directional distribution of Dendra2-Actin single molecules, while Dendra2-HA molecules seem to be randomly oriented in a cluster. The availability of orientation information in SMLM without the need for additional optics adds a new feature, which can be explored to reveal the state of a single molecule (orientation and conformational changes) in cellular sub-domains / partitions. The study implies that the orientation of single molecules that has more profound implications for the functioning of macromolecules. The orientation information revealed by oSM LM technique gives it a wide-spread appeal and expands the reach of localization microscopy.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule fluorescence imaging experiments generally require sub-nanomolar protein concentrations to isolate single protein molecules, which makes such experiments challenging in live cells due to high intracellular protein concentrations. Here, we show that single-molecule observations can be achieved in live cells through a drastic reduction in the observation volume using overmilled zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs - subwavelength-size holes in a metal film). Overmilling of the ZMW in a palladium film creates a nanowell of tunable size in the glass layer below the aperture, which cells can penetrate. We present a thorough theoretical and experimental characterization of the optical properties of these nanowells over a wide range of ZMW diameters and overmilling depths, showing an excellent signal confinement and a five-fold fluorescence enhancement of fluorescent molecules inside nanowells. ZMW nanowells facilitate live-cell imaging, as cells form stable protrusions into the nanowells. Importantly, the nanowells greatly reduce cytoplasmic background fluorescence, enabling detection of individual membrane-bound fluorophores in the presence of high cytoplasmic expression levels, which could not be achieved with TIRF microscopy. Zero-mode waveguide nanowells thus provide great potential to study individual proteins in living cells.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=141 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/546504v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@156ab8borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1185744org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@109370corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fd2bba_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Alterations of nuclear structure and function, and associated impact on gene transcription, are a hallmark of cancer cells. Little is known of these alterations in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs), a key component of the tumor stroma. Here we show that loss of androgen receptor (AR), which triggers early steps of CAF activation in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), leads to nuclear membrane alterations and increased micronuclei formation, which are unlinked from induction of cellular senescence. Similar alterations occur in fully established CAFs, which are overcome by restored AR function. AR associates with nuclear lamin A/C and loss of AR results in a substantially increased lamin A/C nucleoplasmic redistribution. Mechanistically, AR functions as a bridge between lamin A/C with the protein phosphatase PPP1. In parallel with a decreased lamin-PPP1 association, AR loss results in a marked increase of lamin A/C phosphorylation at Ser 301, which is also a feature of CAFs. Phosphorylated lamin A/C at Ser 301 binds to the transcription promoter regulatory region of several CAF effector genes, which are upregulated due to the loss of AR. More directly, expression of a lamin A/C Ser301 phosphomimetic mutant alone is sufficient to convert normal fibroblasts into tumor-promoting CAFs of the myofibroblast subtype, without an impact on senescence. These findings highlight the pivotal role of the AR-lamin A/C-PPP1 axis and lamin A/C phosphorylation at Ser 301 in driving CAF activation.",

    "abstract": "The formation of precise numbers of neuronal connections, known as synapses, is crucial for brain function. Therefore, synaptogenesis mechanisms have been one of the main focuses of cellular and molecular neuroscience. Immunohistochemistry is a common tool for labeling and visualization of synapses. Thus, quantifying the numbers of synapses from light microscopy images enables screening the impacts of experimental manipulations on synapse development. Despite its utility, this approach is paired with low throughput image analysis methods that are challenging to learn, and results are variable between experimenters. We developed a new open-source ImageJ-based software, SynBot, to address these technical bottlenecks by automating several stages of the analysis. SynBot incorporates the machine learning algorithm ilastik for accurate thresholding for synaptic puncta identification, and the code can easily be modified by users. The use of this software will allow for rapid and reproducible screening of synaptic phenotypes in healthy and diseased nervous systems.\n\nMotivationLight microscopy imaging of pre- and post-synaptic proteins from neurons in tissue or in vitro allows for the effective identification of synaptic structures. Previous methods for quantitative analysis of these images were time-consuming, required extensive user training, and the source code could not be easily modified.

We crossed Syt9fl/fl mice with Rho-iCre, HRGP-Cre, and CMV-cre mice to generate mice in which Syt9 was eliminated from rods (rodSyt9CKO), cones (coneSyt9CKO), or whole animals (CMVSyt9). CMVSyt9 mice showed an increase in scotopic electroretinogram (ERG) b-waves evoked by bright flashes with no change in a-waves. Cone-driven photopic ERG b-waves were not significantly different in CMVSyt9 knockout mice and selective elimination of Syt9 from cones had no effect on ERGs. However, selective elimination from rods decreased scotopic and photopic b-waves as well as oscillatory potentials. These changes occurred only with bright flashes where cone responses contribute. Synaptic release was measured in individual rods by recording anion currents activated by glutamate binding to presynaptic glutamate transporters. Loss of Syt9 from rods had no effect on spontaneous or depolarization-evoked release.

    "abstract": "The widespread prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection remains a great challenge to the human health. The existing vaccines are not ideal for preventing H. pylori infection; thus, exploring highly effective adjuvants may improve the immunoprotective efficacy of H. pylori vaccines. In a previous study, we found that outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), a type of nanoscale particle spontaneously produced by Gram-negative bacteria, could act as adjuvants to boost the immune response to vaccine antigens. In the present study, we explored the potential application of OMVs as delivery vectors for adjuvant development. We constructed recombinant OMVs containing cytokines interleukin 17A or interferon-{gamma} and evaluated their function as adjuvants in combination with inactivated whole-cell vaccine (WCV) or UreB as vaccine antigens. Our results showed that recombinant OMVs as adjuvants could induce stronger humoral and mucosal immune responses in mice than wild-type H. pylori OMVs and the cholera toxin (CT) adjuvant. Additionally, the recombinant OMVs significantly promoted Th1/Th2/Th17-type immune responses. Furthermore, the recombinant OMV adjuvant induced more potent clearance of H. pylori than CT and wild-type OMVs. Our data suggest that the recombinant OMVs coupled with cytokines may become potent adjuvants for development of novel and effective vaccines against H. pylori infection.\n\nImportanceHelicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is one of the important risk factors for gastric cancer, and its vaccine is crucial for its prevention and control. However, to date, no effective vaccine has been approved. Exploring novel and effective vaccine adjuvants may provide new perspectives and ideas for the development of H. pylori vaccines. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) deserve more attention as a novel form of vaccine and adjuvant. We have long focused on OMVs as vaccine adjuvants to enhance efficacy by delivering eukaryotic plasmid expressing immune promoting cytokines in wild-type OMVs. Our results are expected to provide a new adjuvant form for the development of H. pylori vaccine, and this adjuvant design strategy can also be used in the development of vaccines for other types of pathogens, including bacteria and even viruses.",

    "abstract": "Piroplasms, which include the agents of cattle fever and human and dog babesiosis, are a diverse group of blood parasites of significant veterinary and medical importance. The invasive Asian longhorned tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, is a known vector of piroplasms in its native range in east Asia and invasive range in Australasia. In the US state of Virginia, H. longicornis has been associated with Theileria orientalis Ikeda outbreaks that caused cattle mortality. We examined 667 H. longicornis collected in 2021 from three sites in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the US state where established populations of this species were first detected in 2017. We used primers targeting the 18S small subunit rRNA and the cytochrome b oxidase loci and unveiled the presence of DNA from an unidentified Theileria species (in 1 nymph) and Theileria cervi type F (1 adult, 5 nymphs). In addition, we sequenced a 130 bp fragment of the cytochrome oxidase b locus from Odocoileus virginianus, the white-tailed deer, in a partially engorged questing H. longicornis, supporting the association of this tick species with deer. We also detected DNA from an undescribed Babesia sensu stricto ( true Babesia, 2 adults, 2 nymphs) as well as Babesia sp. Coco (1 adult, 1 nymph). Finally, we detected DNA from Babesia microti S837 (1 adult, 4 nymphs). Babesia microti S837 has been sequenced from striped skunks, Mephitis mephitis, and is closely related to the human pathogen B. microti US-type. The five parasites we are associating with H. longicornis represent a diverse assemblage spanning three clades in the piroplasm phylogeny, two undescribed, raising concerns of transmission amplification of veterinary pathogens as well as spillover of pathogens from wildlife to humans.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of regulatory regions in the genome plays a critical role in shaping the diversity of life. While this process is primarily sequence-dependent, the enormous complexity of biological systems has made it difficult to understand the factors underlying regulation and its evolution. Here, we apply deep neural networks as a tool to investigate the sequence determinants underlying chromatin accessibility in different tissues of Drosophila. We train hybrid convolution-attention neural networks to accurately predict ATAC-seq peaks using only local DNA sequences as input. We show that a model trained in one species has nearly identical performance when tested in another species, implying that the sequence determinants of accessibility are highly conserved. Indeed, model performance remains excellent even in distantly-related species. By using our model to examine species-specific gains in chromatin accessibility, we find that their orthologous inaccessible regions in other species have surprisingly similar model outputs, suggesting that these regions may be ancestrally poised for evolution. We then use in silico saturation mutagenesis to reveal evidence of selective constraint acting specifically on inaccessible chromatin regions. We further show that chromatin accessibility can be accurately predicted from short subsequences in each example. However, in silico knock-out of these sequences does not qualitatively impair classification, implying that chromatin accessibility is mutationally robust. Subsequently, we demonstrate that chromatin accessibility is predicted to be robust to large-scale random mutation even in the absence of selection. We also perform in silico evolution experiments under the regime of strong selection and weak mutation (SSWM) and show that chromatin accessibility can be extremely malleable despite its mutational robustness. However, selection acting in different directions in a tissue-specific manner can substantially slow adaptation. Finally, we identify motifs predictive of chromatin accessibility and recover motifs corresponding to known chromatin accessibility activators and repressors. These results demonstrate the conservation of the sequence determinants of accessibility and the general robustness of chromatin accessibility, as well as the power of deep neural networks as tools to answer fundamental questions in regulatory genomics and evolution.",

How does the cascade of neural processing elicited by scene viewing to facilitate navigational planning unfold over time? To investigate, we recorded human brain responses to visual scenes with electroencephalography (EEG) and related those to computational models that operationalize three aspects of scene processing (2D, 3D, and semantic information), as well as to a behavioral model capturing navigational affordances. We found a temporal processing hierarchy: navigational affordance is processed later than the other scene features (2D, 3D, and semantic) investigated. This reveals the temporal order with which the human brain computes complex scene information and suggests that the brain leverages these pieces of information to plan navigation.",

    "abstract": "Despite the wide availability of several safe and effective vaccines that can prevent severe COVID-19 disease, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) that can partially evade vaccine immunity remains a global health concern. In addition, the emergence of highly mutated and neutralization-resistant SARS-CoV-2 VOCs such as BA.1 and BA.5 that can partially or fully evade (1) many therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in clinical use underlines the need for additional effective treatment strategies. Here, we characterize the antiviral activity of GS-5245, Obeldesivir (ODV), an oral prodrug of the parent nucleoside GS-441524, which targets the highly conserved RNA-dependent viral RNA polymerase (RdRp). Importantly, we show that GS-5245 is broadly potent in vitro against alphacoronavirus HCoV-NL63, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-related Bat-CoV RsSHC014, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 WA/1, and the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 BA.1 Omicron variant in vitro and highly effective as antiviral therapy in mouse models of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 (WA/1), MERS-CoV and Bat-CoV RsSHC014 pathogenesis. In all these models of divergent coronaviruses, we observed protection and/or significant reduction of disease metrics such as weight loss, lung viral replication, acute lung injury, and degradation in pulmonary function in GS-5245-treated mice compared to vehicle controls. Finally, we demonstrate that GS-5245 in combination with the main protease (Mpro) inhibitor nirmatrelvir had increased efficacy in vivo against SARS-CoV-2 compared to each single agent. Altogether, our data supports the continuing clinical evaluation of GS-5245 in humans infected with COVID-19, including as part of a combination antiviral therapy, especially in populations with the most urgent need for more efficacious and durable interventions.",

However, little is known about the molecular mechanism regulating the defense response of B. tabaci post destruxin application.\n\nResultsIn this study, we explored the molecular responses of B. tabaci exposed to destruxin A (DA) using RNA-Seq and differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis. A total of 1702, 616, and 555 DEGs were identified in B. tabaci after 4, 8, and 12 h of destruxin A treatment. In addition, 40 putative detoxification-related DEGs, including 29 cytochrome P450s (P450s), 5 glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and 5 carboxylesterases (CarEs) were also identified. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that the expression profiles of 19 random DEGs were consistent with the RNA-Seq results.\n\nConclusionThese findings serve as valuable information for a better understanding of the interaction and molecular mechanisms involved in the defense response of B. tabaci against DA.",

Since the release of the first version of GIFT, the database kept on expanding. We introduce GIFT version 3.0, which contains 5,169 checklists referring to 3,400 regions. These checklists include a total of 371,148 land plant species, mostly vascular plants, of which 354,848 are accepted species names, and 109 functional traits. This new version uses new resources for taxonomic name standardization, is matched to a new plant phylogeny, comes with a new trait aggregation workflow, and includes additional environmental variables.\nC_LIO_LIWe also present the GIFT R-package, which contains all necessary functions to retrieve distributional, functional, phylogenetic, and environmental data from the GIFT database. The package comes with a dedicated website, https://biogeomacro.github.io/GIFT/, which includes three rich vignettes to guide users in retrieving data from GIFT.\nC_LIO_LIThe recent development of GIFT and its associated R-package provide ecologists with access to one of the largest plant databases.

Here, a population genetics model of mutation and selection is described and analyzed that incorporates the creation of new adaptive mutational opportunities. For sexual populations, mean log fitness fitness is determined as a function of the model parameters. For sexual populations and finite genomes a formula for the optimal mutation rate is derived. The optimal mutation rate is found to be one for which the fitness losses associated with positive and negative selection are equal. For asexual populations mean log fitness is found to be proportional to its variance less a constant. This variance is made small by the negative skewness of the log fitness distribution. The sexual model suggests adaptive mutations in sexual populations cant be ignored simply because they are rare. The asexual model suggests asexuality can sometimes incur a large fitness cost.",

    "abstract": "Cohorts of individuals that have been genotyped and phenotyped for genomic selection programs offer the opportunity to better understand genetic variation associated with complex traits. Here, we perform an association study for traits related to body size and muscular development in intensively selected beef cattle. We leveraged multiple trait information to refine and interpret the significant associations. After a multiple-step genotype imputation to the sequence-level for 14,762 Belgian Blue beef (BBB) cattle cows, we performed a GWAS for 11 traits related to muscular development and body size. The 37 identified genome-wide significant QTL could be condensed in 11 unique QTL regions based on their position. There was evidence for pleiotropic effects in most of these regions (e.g., correlated association signals, overlap between credible sets of candidate variants - CSCV). We consequently applied a multiple-trait approach to combine information from different traits to refine the CSCV. In several QTL regions, we identified strong candidate genes known to be related to growth and height in other species such as LCORL-NCAPG or CCND2. For some of these genes, relevant candidate variants were identified in the CSCV, including three new missense variants in EZH2, PAPPA2 and ADAM12, possibly two additional coding variants in LCORL, and candidate regulatory variants linked to CCND2 and ARMC12. Strikingly, four other QTL regions were related to five (recessive) deleterious coding variants previously identified. Heterozygotes for several of these mutations have favorable effects for muscular development traits. Our study further supports that a set of common genes controls body size across mammalian species. In particular, we added new genes to the list of those associated with height in both human and cattle. We also identified new strong candidate causing variants in some of those genes, strengthening the evidence of the causality of these genes. Several breed-specific recessive deleterious variants were identified in our QTL regions, probably as a result of the extreme selection for muscular development in BBB cattle.",

Here, we characterized the RNA virome of 10 sylvatic mosquitos species from Atlantic forest remains at a sylvatic-urban interface in Northeast Brazil employing a metatranscriptomic approach. We detected a total of 21 viral families. The phylogenetic reconstructions of 13 viral families revealed that the majority of the sequences are putative ISVs. The phylogenetic positioning and, in most cases, the association with a high RdRp amino acid divergence from other known viruses suggests that the viruses characterized here represent 60 new viral species. Therefore, the sylvatic mosquitoes viral community revealed a predominance of highly divergent viruses highlighting the limited knowledge we still have about the natural virome that infect these blood feeding insects. Moreover, we found a strong species-virome association as none of the viruses recovered were shared between the species investigated.

Finding effective treatments to stem the wave of infected individuals needing hospitalization and reduce the risk of adverse events was paramount. For scientists and healthcare professionals addressing this challenge, the need to rapidly identify medical countermeasures became urgent, and many compounds in clinical use for other indications were repurposed for COVID-19 clinical trials after preliminary preclinical data demonstrated antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Two repurposed compounds, fluvoxamine and amodiaquine, showed efficacy in reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in preclinical experiments, but ultimately failed in clinical trials, highlighting the need for improved predictive preclinical tools that can be rapidly deployed for events such as pandemic emerging infectious diseases. The PREDICT96-ALI platform is a high-throughput, high-fidelity microphysiological system (MPS) that recapitulates primary human tracheobronchial tissue and supports highly robust and reproducible viral titers of SARS-CoV-2 variants Delta and Omicron. When amodiaquine and fluvoxamine were tested in PREDICT96-ALI, neither compound demonstrated an antiviral response, consistent with clinical outcomes and in contrast with prior reports assessing the efficacy of these compounds in other human cell-based in vitro platforms.

    "abstract": "Developments in long-term space exploration necessitate advancements in countermeasures against microgravity-induced skeletal muscle loss. Astronaut data shows considerable variation in muscle loss in response to microgravity. Previous experiments suggest that genetic background influences the skeletal muscle response to unloading, but no in-depth analysis of genetic expression was performed. Here, we placed eight inbred founder strains of the diversity outbred mice (129S1/SvImJ, A/J, C57BL/6J, CAST/EiJ, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HILtJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ) in simulated microgravity (SM) via hindlimb unloading for three weeks. Body weight, muscle morphology, muscle strength, protein synthesis marker expression, and RNA expression were collected. A/J and CAST/EiJ mice were most susceptible to SM-induced muscle loss, whereas NOD/ShiLtJ mice were the most protected. In response to SM, A/J and CAST/EiJ mice experienced reductions in body weight, muscle mass, muscle volume, and muscle cross-sectional area. A/J mice had the highest number of differentially expressed genes (68) and associated gene ontologies (328). Downregulation of immunological gene ontologies and genes encoding anabolic immune factors suggest that immune dysregulation contributes to the response of A/J mice to SM. Several muscle properties showed significant interactions between SM and mouse strain and a high degree of heritability. These data imply that genetic background plays a role in the degree of muscle loss in SM and that more individualized programs should be developed for astronauts to protect their skeletal muscles against microgravity on long term missions.",

    "abstract": "Adeno-Associated Virus 9 (AAV9) is a delivery platform highly exploited to develop gene-based treatments for neurological disorders given its low pathogenicity and brain tissue tropism. However, the efficacy of this vector is dampened by its relatively low efficiency to cross the adult blood-brain barrier (BBB) and inherent targeting to the liver upon intravenous delivery. We generated a new peptide display library starting from a galactose binding-deficient AAV9 capsid and selected two new AAV9 engineered capsids, named AAV-Se1 and AAV-Se2, with an enhanced targeting in mouse and marmoset brains after intravenous delivery. Interestingly, the loss of the galactose binding strongly reduced the undesired targeting to peripheral organs, and above all liver, while not compromising the transduction of the brain vasculature. However, we had to reconstitute the galactose binding in order to efficiently infect non-endothelial brain cells. Thus, the combinatorial actions of the galactose-binding domain and the installed exogenous displayed peptide are crucial to enhance BBB crossing together with brain cell transduction. We also identified Ly6C1 as primary receptor for AAV-Se2 which is a Ly6A homologue highly expressed in the brain endothelial cells. This study describes a new strategy to select neurotropic AAV9 variants and identifies two novel capsids with high brain endothelial infectivity and extremely low liver targeting based on manipulating the AAV9 galactose binding domain.",

    "abstract": "DNA sample contamination is a major issue in clinical and research applications of whole genome and exome sequencing. Even modest levels of contamination can substantially affect the overall quality of variant calls and lead to widespread genotyping errors. Currently, popular tools for estimating the contamination level use short-read data (BAM/CRAM files), which are expensive to store and manipulate and often not retained or shared widely. We propose a new metric to estimate DNA sample contamination from variant-level whole genome and exome sequence data, CHARR, Contamination from Homozygous Alternate Reference Reads, which leverages the infiltration of reference reads within homozygous alternate variant calls. CHARR uses a small proportion of variant-level genotype information and thus can be computed from single-sample gVCFs or callsets in VCF or BCF formats, as well as efficiently stored variant calls in Hail VDS format. Our results demonstrate that CHARR accurately recapitulates results from existing tools with substantially reduced costs, improving the accuracy and efficiency of downstream analyses of ultra-large whole genome and exome sequencing datasets.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn recent years, three-dimensional (3D) spheroid models have become increasingly popular in scientific research as they provide a more physiologically relevant microenvironment that mimics in vivo conditions. The use of 3D spheroid assays has proven to be advantageous as it offers a better understanding of the cellular behavior, drug efficacy, and toxicity as compared to traditional two-dimensional cell culture methods. However, the use of 3D spheroid assays is impeded by the absence of automated and user-friendly tools for spheroid image analysis, which adversely affects the reproducibility and throughput of these assays.\n\nResultsTo address these issues, we have developed a fully automated, web-based tool called SpheroScan, which uses the deep learning framework called Mask Regions with Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) for image detection and segmentation. To develop a deep learning model that could be applied to spheroid images from a range of experimental conditions, we trained the model using spheroid images captured using IncuCyte Live-Cell Analysis System and a conventional microscope. Performance evaluation of the trained model using validation and test datasets shows promising results.\n\nConclusionSpheroScan allows for easy analysis of large numbers of images and provides interactive visualization features for a more in-depth understanding of the data. Our tool represents a significant advancement in the analysis of spheroid images and will facilitate the widespread adoption of 3D spheroid models in scientific research. The source code and a detailed tutorial for SpheroScan are available at https://github.com/FunctionalUrology/SpheroScan.\n\nKey PointsO_LIA deep learning model was trained to detect and segment spheroids in images from microscopes and Incucytes.\nC_LIO_LIThe model performed well on both types of images with the total loss decreasing significantly during the training process.\nC_LIO_LIA web tool called SpheroScan was developed to facilitate the analysis of spheroid images, which includes prediction and visualization modules.\nC_LIO_LISpheroScan is efficient and scalable, making it possible to handle large datasets with ease.\nC_LIO_LISpheroScan is user-friendly and accessible to researchers, making it a valuable resource for the analysis of spheroid image data.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "APOBEC3, an enzyme subfamily that plays a role in virus restriction by generating mutations at particular DNA motifs or mutational \"hotspots,\" can drive viral mutagenesis with host-specific preferential hotspot mutations contributing to pathogen variation. While previous analysis of viral genomes from the 2022 Mpox (formerly Monkeypox) disease outbreak has shown a high frequency of C>T mutations at TC motifs, suggesting recent mutations are human APOBEC3-mediated, how emerging monkeypox virus (MPXV) strains will evolve as a consequence of APOBEC3-mediated mutations remains unknown. By measuring hotspot under-representation, depletion at synonymous sites, and a combination of the two, we analyzed APOBEC3-driven evolution in human poxvirus genomes, finding varying hotspot under-representation patterns. While the native poxvirus molluscum contagiosum exhibits a signature consistent with extensive coevolution with human APOBEC3, including depletion of TC hotspots, variola virus shows an intermediate effect consistent with ongoing evolution at the time of eradication. MPXV, likely the result of recent zoonosis, showed many genes with more TC hotspots than expected by chance (over-representation) and fewer GC hotspots than expected (under-representation). These results suggest the MPXV genome: 1) may have evolved in a host with a particular APOBEC GC hotspot preference, 2) has inverted terminal repeat (ITR) regions -which may be exposed to APOBEC3 for longer during viral replication- and longer genes likely to evolve faster, and therefore 3) has a heightened potential for future human APOBEC3-meditated evolution as the virus spreads in the human population. Our predictions of MPXV mutational potential can both help guide future vaccine development and identification of putative drug targets and add urgency to the task of containing human Mpox disease transmission and uncovering the ecology of the virus in its reservoir host.",

    "abstract": "The cellular environment is crowded with macromolecules and far from thermodynamic equilibrium. This active, crowded environment influences biochemical reactions and the formation of cellular structures such as membraneless organelles. These physical properties can change during normal physiology and in disease states such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, impacting cell behavior and function. Therefore, it is crucial to develop methods to characterize these properties. Microrheology is the inference of physical properties from the motion of tracer particles embedded within a material. This technique requires single particle tracking (SPT) and analysis of these tracks through the framework of soft-condensed matter physics. Analysis of SPT data can be challenging due to the lack of comprehensive user-friendly software tools. To address this, we introduce GEMspa, a software package implemented as a plugin for the open source image analysis platform, napari. GEMspa provides a GUI for a commonly used localization/tracking algorithm (via Trackpy), and a suite of methods to extract basic parameters describing particle motion. This platform aims to streamline the workflow of data analysis steps and allow researchers to visualize and optimize parameters for high-quality results, thereby making microrheology accessible to non-expert scientists.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing transcription data requires intensive statistical analysis in order to obtain useful biological information and knowledge. A significant portion of this data is affected by random noise or even noise intrinsic to the modeling of the experiment. Without a robust treatment, the data might not be very thoroughly explored and even incorrect conclusions could be drawn. Examining the correlation between gene expression profiles is one of the ways bioinformaticians extract information from transcriptomic experiments. However, the correlation measurements traditionally used have worrisome shortcomings that need to be addressed. This paper compares the two most common correlation measurements, Pearsons r and Spearmans r, to the newly developed coincidence index, a similarity measurement that combines Jaccard and interiority indexes and generalizes them to be applied to vectors containing real values. We used experimental data from a microarray experiment from the archaeon Halobacterium salinarum that evaluates the effects on the organism when exposed to light in an anaerobic environment. The utilized method explores the co-expressed metabolic pathways by measuring the correlations between enzymes that share metabolites and searches for local maxima using a simulated annealing algorithm. We demonstrate that the coincidence index extracts larger, more comprehensive, and more statistically significant pathways than the traditional Pearsons and Spearmans measurements.",

    "abstract": "When individuals make a movement that produces an unexpected outcome, they learn from the resulting error. This process, essential in both acquiring new motor skills and adapting to changing environments, critically relies on error sensitivity, which governs how much behavioral change results from a given error. Although behavioral and computational evidence suggests error sensitivity can change in response to task demands, neural evidence regarding the flexibility of error sensitivity in the human brain is lacking. Critically, the sensitivity of the nervous system to auditory errors during speech production, a complex and well-practiced motor behavior, has been extensively studied by examining the prediction-driven suppression of auditory cortical activity. Here, we tested whether the nervous systems sensitivity to errors, as measured by this suppression, can be modulated by altering speakers perceived variability. Our results showed that error sensitivity was increased after exposure to an auditory perturbation that increased participants perceived variability, consistent with predictions generated from previous behavioral data and state-space modeling. Conversely, we observed no significant changes in error sensitivity when perceived variability was unaltered or artificially reduced. The current study establishes the validity of behaviorally modulating the nervous systems sensitivity to errors. As sensitivity to sensory errors plays a critical role in sensorimotor adaptation, modifying error sensitivity has the potential to enhance motor learning and rehabilitation in speech and, potentially, more broadly across motor domains.\n\nSignificance StatementThe process of learning from error is essential for both the acquisition of new skills and successful adaptation to changing environments. Such error-based learning critically relies on error sensitivity, which determines how much we learn from a given error. Although evidence from behavioral studies suggests error sensitivity is malleable, neural evidence regarding the flexibility of error sensitivity in the human brain is lacking. Here, we showed that the nervous systems sensitivity to errors can be modulated by altering perceived variability. The present study establishes the validity of behaviorally modulating neural sensitivity to sensory errors. Improving our ability to learn from error can play a critical role in applied settings such as rehabilitation.",

Our results demonstrate that entrainment of a circadian clock by cyclic fearful stimuli can lead to severely mistimed circadian behavior that persists even after the aversive stimulus is removed.

    "abstract": "Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), a heterogeneous population, are tissue-resident myeloid cells and have an essential role in bacterial infection. Although the plasticity of NKp46- CCR6- double-negative (DN) ILC3s toward the NKp46+ ILC3s is an important process in the development of intestinal immunity, the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for this process remain poorly understood. Nur77 is an orphan receptor which regulates intestinal ILC3s expansion. However, the impact of Nur77 on the plasticity of intestinal ILC3s remains unclear. Here, we generated Nur77 null mice and investigated ILC3s expansion. The deficiency of Nur77 inhibited the mouse small intestinal ILC3s expansion and conversion of NKp46- ILC3s to NKp46+ ILC3s. We identified that 12R-HETE derived from arachidonic acid (ARA) in mouse intestine is an endogenous ligand of Nur77 and activates its transcriptional activity. The treatment with 12R-HETE promoted the differentiation of NKp46- ILC3s into NKp46+ ILC3s by enhancing the T-bet expression, thereby increased IFN-{gamma} production from NKp46+ ILC3s, and reduced the susceptibility to bacterial infection in WT, but not Nur77-/-, suckling mice. An integrated analysis of ATAC-seq and Smart RNA-seq showed that Rflnb, Impdh1, Map1s, and Gtpbp3 might be downstream targeted genes of Nur77 in response to 12R-HETE and mediate the regulation of ILC3s plasticity. In the presence of mycophenolic acid, an inhibitor of IMPDH, 12R-HETE no longer regulated the percentages of ROR{gamma}t+ILC3s and NKp46+ILC3s. We conclude that 12R-HETE acts as an endogenous ligand of Nur77, and regulates the ILC3s expansion and plasticity, and in turn, gut homeostasis and pathogen defense.",

    "abstract": "Biosynthesis and biodegradation of microorganisms critically underpin the development of biotechnology, new drugs and therapies, and environmental remediation. However, the vast majority of uncultured microbial species along with their metabolic capacities in extreme environments remain obscured. To unravel the metabolic potential of these microbial dark matters (MDMs), we investigated four deep-inland hypersaline lakes with largely diversified environmental parameters in Xinjiang, China. Metagenomic binning obtained 3,030 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) spanning 82 phyla, of which 2,363 MAGs could not be assigned to a known genus. MDM MAGs were abundantly observed with distinct taxa among lakes, possibly linked to the diversification of physiochemical conditions. Analysis of biosynthetic potentials identified 9,635 biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs), in which 8,966 BGCs considered novel. We found that some MDM phyla consistently comprised enriched BGCs, which were considered to play essential roles in biotechnological applications. In addition, biodegradation potentials such as dehalogenation, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (Anammox), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), and plastics degradation were found in new microbial clades from hypersaline lakes. These findings substantially expanded the genetic repository of biosynthesis and biodegradation potentials, which can further assist the development of new and innovative applications in biotechnology.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=91 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/546814v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11d7563org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@105b82eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7ed58eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f69547_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIver 3,000 MAGs obtained from hypersaline lakes that enriching genomic resources.\nC_LIO_LI8,000+ potential biosynthetic gene clusters in uncultured microbes.\nC_LIO_LIbiodegradation potential in several microbial dark matter lineages.\nC_LIO_LIinsights for biotechnology, environmental management applications.\nC_LIO_LIand resilient microorganisms in extreme environments.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The Arenaviridae family within the Bunyavirales order of segmented RNA viruses contains over 50 species grouped into four genera, Antennavirus, Hartmanivirus, Mammarenavirus and Reptarenavirus. Several mammarenaviruses are associated with fatal hemorrhagic fevers, including Lassa, Lujo and Junin viruses. The mammarenavirus member lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is largely non-pathogenic to humans and represents a tractable model system for studying arenavirus molecular and cellular biology. During infection of cells in culture, a high proportion of LCMV spread is between directly neighbouring cells. Consistent with this observation LCMV-infected cells extrude multiple tunnelling nanotube (TNT)-like structures forming intercellular connections that could provide a route of cell-to-cell spread. To investigate this, we used recombinant LCMV with engineered epitope tags in glycoprotein spike (GP-1) and matrix (Z) proteins, alongside nucleoprotein (NP) antisera, to reveal that all three major structural proteins co-localised within TNT-like connections. Furthermore, utilising fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) we showed NP also co-localised with LCMV genomic sense RNA. Taken together, these observations suggested LCMV virions pass between cells through intercellular connections to infect new cells. Consistent with this, addition of a potent LCMV neutralising antibody to supernatants during infection failed to block LCMV spread through cultures, revealing that cell-to-cell connectivity plays a major role in LCMV transmission. This is the first report of cell-cell infection via TNT-like connections for any species of the 14 families within the Bunyavirales order. This study furthers our understanding of how arenaviruses manipulate the host to establish infection, which may aid in the development of effective anti-viral therapeutics.\n\nIMPORTANCEArenaviruses include some of the most serious human pathogens in existence, although no clinically approved vaccines or therapies are currently available to prevent their associated disease. As with most pathogens, transmission of arenaviruses from one cell to another is a critical aspect of infection and resulting pathogenicity. Here, we showed that model arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) can spread between cells without exposure to the extracellular space. We visualized the three major LCMV structural proteins, namely nucleoprotein, glycoprotein spike and matrix co-localized along with genomic RNA within tubular structures connecting adjacent cells. The use of a potent neutralizing antibody to block the extracellular route of LCMV transmission reduced spread within cultured cells to approximately half that of untreated cultures. Taken together, these results suggest intercellular connections represent important conduits for arenavirus spread. This information will aid in the development of antiviral strategies that prevent both intra- and extracellular transmission routes.",

    "abstract": "While paleovirological evidence supports the idea that the ancestors of modern simian (SIV) and prosimian (pSIV) immunodeficiency viruses have been evolving in nonhuman primates for millions of years, standard molecular clock methods calibrated using contemporary sequences significantly underestimate their times of origin. This discrepancy is attributed to the time-dependent nature of evolutionary rate estimates whereby the rate of virus evolution varies with respect to the time window of its measurement. While biogeographical calibrations may provide better estimates across intermediate timescales, there is currently no unifying framework that can allow inference of lentiviral ages across all relevant timescales. Here we showed that by correcting for such time-dependent rate effects using the recently developed Prisoner-of-War evolutionary model, we can successfully reconstruct the evolutionary history of human, simian, and prosimian immunodeficiency viruses across vastly different timescales and allowed estimates of the age of lineages that gave rise to HIV-1 and HIV-2. The model also predicted that the most recent common ancestor of SIV and pSIV lived around 21 million years ago, suggesting that the most likely explanation for the origins of primate lentiviruses is a terrestrial transfer of lentiviruses between African and Malagasy primates during the last episode of colonisation of Madagascar. Infections have entered via a land bridge in a group of mammals or through a nonprimate vector or transfer mediated by an aerial vector species. We also found that the most recent common ancestor of SIVs lived nearly a million years ago and that some SIV lineages codiverged with their hosts for several hundreds of thousands of years. The predicted long evolutionary timescales of SIVs and potential for close virus/host co-adaptation is consistent with their reduced or minimal pathogenicity in their native hosts, contrasting with the very recent evolutionary origins of highly pathogenic HIV strains in humans.",

    "abstract": "Enteroviruses encode two protease active sites, in the 2A and 3C coding regions. While they target many host proteins, they first need to be excised from the viral polyprotein in which they are embedded. Polyprotein cleavage can occur either intra-molecularly (in cis) or inter-molecularly (in trans). Previous work suggested that antivirals targeting intra-molecular cleavages could generate inhibitory precursors that suppress the outgrowth of drug-resistant variants. Therefore, we wanted to evaluate enteroviral cleavage patterns to identify such obligate intra-molecular cleavages for drug target selection. Using translation extracts, we show that cis cleavage of the 2A protease N-terminal junction is conserved across three enteroviruses, while the mechanism for the N-terminal junction of 3C varies, with EV-D68 3C cleavage occurring in cis and poliovirus 3C cleavage occurring in trans.\n\nAntiviral agents targeting proteases are often identified via their ability to block the cleavage of artificial peptide substrates. Here, we show that antivirals identified for their abilities to block inter-molecular cleavage can sometimes block intra-molecular cleavage of the protease from its polyprotein as well, but with widely varying efficacy. Additionally, we demonstrate that, for three enteroviral species, genomes defective in 2A protease activity suppress the growth of wild-type virus in mixed populations, supporting the hypothesis that preventing intra-molecular cleavage at the VP1{middle dot}2A junction can create dominantly inhibitory precursors. These data argue that, to reduce the likelihood of drug resistance, protease-targeted antivirals should be evaluated for their ability to block intra-molecular polyprotein cleavages in addition to inter-molecular cleavage of other substrates.\n\nIMPORTANCEMost protease-targeted antiviral development evaluates the ability of small molecules to inhibit cleavage of model substrates. However, before they can cleave any other substrates, viral proteases need to cleave themselves from the viral polyprotein in which they have been translated. This can occur either intra- or inter-molecularly. Here, we show that, for poliovirus, Enterovirus D68 and Enterovirus A71, many of these cleavages are required to occur intra-molecularly. Further, we show that antivirals identified for their ability to block cleavage of artificial substrates can also block intra-molecular self-cleavage, but that their efficacy in doing so varies widely. We argue that evaluating candidate antivirals for their ability to block these cleavages is vital to drug development, because the buildup of uncleaved precursors can be inhibitory to the virus and potentially suppress the selection of drug-resistant variants.",

    "abstract": "The large-conductance, Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels consist of the Ca2+- and voltage-sensing and pore-forming  (BK) subunits and regulatory auxiliary {beta} or {gamma} subunits. Concatenated tandem constructs have been proved to be necessary and powerful in understanding the subunit stoichiometry of K+ channel gating and regulation by constraining the stoichiometry, organization, and mutation of individual subunits. However, because of its unique possession of an extra S0 transmembrane segment that puts the N- and C- termini on the opposite sides of the membrane, it is impossible to generate concatenated tandem subunit constructs of BK channels as those done with other K+ channels. In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the atypical \"all-or-none\" modulatory function of the {gamma} subunits and the subunit stoichiometry of BK channel gating, we have taken a novel strategy and generated functional concatenated tandem constructs containing 2 or 4 copies of the BK subunits by splicing BK into 2 protein constructs that can be co-expressed to form functional channels. We observed that the BK channels formed by concatenated tandem constructs are similar to intact channels in voltage and Ca2+ gating properties. Interestingly, the BK{gamma}1 subunit and mutations located at the S6 transmembrane segment and selectivity filter displayed 3 distinct types of subunit stoichiometry in BK channel modulation. By fusion of the BK{gamma}1 subunit to the N-terminus of the concatenated tandem BK constructs, we observed that a single molecule of BK{gamma}1 subunit per tetrameric BK channel is sufficient to fully modulate the channels. The Y294K, F303A, and L312A mutations at each BK subunit has an incremental effect on BK channel gating. The V288A mutation at the selectivity filter produce an \"all-or-none\" effect but requires mutations at all 4 BK subunits to have modulatory effect on channel gating, i.e., mutations at 1, 2, or 3 subunits have nearly no effect. Interestingly, the F307A mutation exhibited an atypical \"all-or-none\" modulatory function similar to that of the {gamma}1 subunit. The diversity in subunit stoichiometry of BK channel modulation indicates distinct mechanisms in affecting BK channel gating. Overall, we have developed novel concatenated tandem constructs for BK channels and revealed three distinct types of subunit stoichiometry in BK channel modulation by the auxiliary {gamma} subunit and mutations at the pore-lining S6 transmembrane segment and selectivity filter.",

    "abstract": "Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is rising in incidence and associated with poor survival, and established risk factors do not explain this trend. Microbiome alterations have been associated with progression from the precursor Barretts esophagus (BE) to EAC, yet the oral microbiome, tightly linked to the esophageal microbiome and easier to sample, has not been extensively studied in this context. We aimed to assess the relationship between the salivary microbiome and neoplastic progression in BE to identify microbiome-related factors that may drive EAC development. We collected clinical data and oral health and hygiene history and characterized the salivary microbiome from 250 patients with and without BE, including 78 with advanced neoplasia (high grade dysplasia or early adenocarcinoma). We assessed differential relative abundance of taxa by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and associations between microbiome composition and clinical features and used microbiome metabolic modeling to predict metabolite production. We found significant shifts and increased dysbiosis associated with progression to advanced neoplasia, with these associations occurring independent of tooth loss, and the largest shifts were with the genus Streptococcus. Microbiome metabolic models predicted significant shifts in the metabolic capacities of the salivary microbiome in patients with advanced neoplasia, including increases in L- lactic acid and decreases in butyric acid and L-tryptophan production. Our results suggest both a mechanistic and predictive role for the oral microbiome in esophageal adenocarcinoma. Further work is warranted to identify the biological significance of these alterations, to validate metabolic shifts, and to determine whether they represent viable therapeutic targets for prevention of progression in BE.",

    "abstract": "The influence of lanthanide biochemistry during methylotrophy demands a reassessment of how the composition and metabolic potential of methylotrophic phyllosphere communities are affected by the presence of lanthanides. To investigate this, methylotrophs - predominant members of the phyllosphere-were isolated from soybean leaves by selecting for bacteria capable of methanol oxidation with lanthanide cofactors. Strikingly, of the 344 pink-pigmented facultative methylotroph isolates, none were obligately lanthanide-dependent. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all strains were nearly identical to each other and to model strains from the extorquens clade of Methylobacterium, with rpoB providing higher resolution than 16s rRNA for strain-specific identification. Despite low species diversity, the metabolic capabilities of the community diverged greatly. Strains encoding identical PQQ-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases displayed significantly different growth from each other on alcohols in the presence and absence of lanthanides. Additionally, 3% of our isolates were capable of growth on sugars and 23% were capable of growth on aromatic acids, expanding the range of multicarbon substrates utilized by extorquens clade members. Whole-genome sequences of eleven novel strains are reported. We hypothesize that the expansion of metabolic capabilities and differential lanthanide metabolisms among closely related strains point to evolution of niche partitioning strategies to promote colonization of the phyllosphere.",

    "abstract": "The resolution of variation within species is critical for interpreting and acting on many microbial measurements. In the key foodborne pathogens Escherichia coli and Salmonella, the primary sub-species classification scheme used is serotyping: differentiating variants within these species by surface antigen profiles. Serotype prediction from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of isolates is now seen as comparable or preferable to traditional laboratory methods where WGS is available. However, laboratory and WGS methods depend on an isolation step that is time-consuming and incompletely represents the sample when multiple strains are present. Community sequencing approaches that skip the isolation step are therefore of interest for pathogen surveillance. Here we evaluated the viability of amplicon sequencing of the full-length 16S rRNA gene for serotyping S. enterica and E. coli. We developed a novel algorithm for serotype prediction, implemented as an R package (Seroplacer), which takes as input full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences and outputs serovar predictions after phylogenetic placement into a reference phylogeny. We achieved over 89% accuracy in predicting Salmonella serotypes on in silico test data, and identified key pathogenic serovars of Salmonella and E. coli in isolate and environmental test samples. Although serotype prediction from 16S sequences is not as accurate as serotype prediction from WGS of isolates, the potential to identify dangerous serovars directly from amplicon sequencing of environmental samples is intriguing for pathogen surveillance. The capabilities developed here are also broadly relevant to other applications where intra-species variation and direct sequencing from environmental samples could be valuable.",

Loss of C-P4H-I mainly affected prolines preceded by an X-position amino acid with a positively charged or a polar uncharged side chain. In contrast, loss of C-P4H-II affected triplets with a negatively charged glutamate or aspartate in the X-position, and their hydroxylation was found to be important as loss of C-P4H-II alone resulted in reduced collagen melting temperature and altered assembly of collagen fibrils and basement membrane. The C-P4H isoenzyme differences in substrate specificity were explained by selective substrate binding to the active site resulting in differences in Km and Vmax values. In conclusion, this study provides a molecular level explanation for the need of multiple C-P4H isoenzymes to generate collagen molecules capable to assemble into intact extracellular matrix structures.",

The hDicer helicase contributes to recognizing pre-miRNA substrates and is suggested to participate in binding of many different cellular RNAs. However, a comprehensive characterization of the biochemical activities and substrate specificity of the hDicer helicase towards different nucleic acids have never been reported. We demonstrate for the first time that the full-length hDicer, through its helicase domain, is capable of ATP hydrolysis. We also show that the hDicer helicase binds only single-but not double-stranded nucleic acids, and that binding of single-stranded RNAs is accompanied by the rearrangement of their structure. The hDicer helicase does not require ATP hydrolysis for this RNA rearrangement activity. Given the documented importance of the hDicer helicase in antiviral defense, the obtained results may contribute to a better understanding of viral diseases and the role of hDicer in virus-host interactions.",

To robustly quantify inter-individual gene expression, we developed a novel pipeline that combines a highly efficient cDNA extraction method with a high-throughput qPCR nanofluidics technology with a bespoke computational analysis. We validated our approach by benchmarking against in vivo reporters. We also screened among hundreds of stress inducible genes, and identified a regulon formed by transcripts belonging to the inducible heat shock protein family. We demonstrate, using a bipartite in vivo fluorescent reporter, that the inter-individual variability in the stress regulon stems mostly from anterior neurons.

    "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic condition caused by trisomy 21 (T21) and characterized by a range of neurological symptoms including intellectual disability, early onset of neurodegeneration and dementia, some of which can be attributed to accelerated aging. N-glycosylation is a protein modification that plays a critical role in numerous biological processes and its dysregulation is associated with a wide range of diseases, in some even before the onset of symptoms. N-glycosylation of total plasma proteins, as well as specific plasma proteins, such as immunoglobulin G, has been shown to change in DS, displaying an accelerated aging phenotype consistent with the various symptoms of premature aging that occur in DS. However, little is known about how T21 affects the N-glycosylation of other cellular proteins. To better understand how T21 affects N-glycosylation during neural differentiation, we characterized and compared the total released N-glycans of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their neural stem cell (NSC) derivatives. We analyzed six different isogenic clones all derived from a single individual with mosaic DS and thus all sharing the same genetic background; however, three had a normal disomic karyotype (D21), while the other three had an additional copy of chromosome 21 (T21). We characterized the total cell N-glycosylation profiles using ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) and subsequent tandem mass spectrometry analysis to determine proposed glycan structures. Our results revealed both qualitative and quantitative differences in the composition of N-glycomes between iPSCs and NSCs, with NSCs showing a higher amount of complex N-glycans and a lower amount of mannosidic N-glycans when compared to iPSCs. Moreover, we found differences in N-glycosylation patterns between D21 and T21 cells. Notably, T21 cells exhibited a significant increase in the amount of pseudohybrid N-glycans. Trisomy 21 also caused a significant decrease in the abundance of a hybrid monoantennary fucosylated glycan (H6N3F1). Our findings define the released N-glycan profile of total cells for both D21 and T21 iPSCs and NSCs and suggest that the presence of a third copy of chromosome 21 impacts N-glycosylation patterns already in the stem cell state.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive radiations are generated through a complex interplay of biotic and abiotic factors. Although adaptive radiations have been widely studied in the context of animal and plant evolution, little is known about how they impact the evolution of the viruses that infect these hosts, which in turn may provide insights into the drivers of disease emergence. We examined how the rapid adaptive radiation of the African cichlid fishes of Lake Tanganyika over the last 10 million years has shaped the diversity and evolution of the viruses they carry. Through metatranscriptomic analysis we identified 121 vertebrate-associated viruses among various tissue types that fell into 13 RNA and 4 DNA virus groups. Host-switching was commonplace, particularly within the Astroviridae, Metahepadnavirus, Nackednavirus, Picornaviridae, and Hepacivirus groups, occurring more frequently than in other fish communities. A time-calibrated phylogeny revealed that hepacivirus evolution was not constant throughout the cichlid radiation, but accelerated 2-3 million years ago, coinciding with a period of rapid cichlid diversification and niche packing in Lake Tanganyika, thereby providing more closely related hosts for viral infection. These data show that African cichlids contain a complex interacting pool of virus diversity, likely reflecting their close genetic relationships that lowers the barriers to cross-species virus transmission.",

    "abstract": "The genome engineering capability of the CRISPR/Cas system depends on the DNA repair machinery to generate the final outcome. Several genes can have an impact on mutations created, but their exact function and contribution to the result of the repair are not completely characterised. This lack of knowledge has limited the ability to comprehend and regulate the editing outcomes. Here, we measure how the absence of 21 repair genes changes the mutation outcomes of Cas9-generated cuts at 2,812 synthetic target sequences in mouse embryonic stem cells. Absence of key non-homologous end joining genes Lig4, Xrcc4, and Xlf abolished small insertions and deletions, while disabling key microhomology-mediated repair genes Nbn and Polq reduced frequency of longer deletions. Complex alleles of combined insertion and deletions were preferentially generated in the absence of Xrcc6. We further discover finer structure in the outcome frequency changes for single nucleotide insertions and deletions between large microhomologies that are differentially modulated by the knockouts. We use the knowledge of the reproducible variation across repair milieus to build predictive models of Cas9 editing results that outperform the current standards. This work improves our understanding of DNA repair gene function, and provides avenues for more precise modulation of CRISPR/Cas9-generated mutations.",

    "abstract": "-Synuclein (-syn) forms amyloid fibrils that are critical in the progression of Parkinsons disease (PD) and serves as the pathological hallmark of PD. Different posttranslational modifications (PTMs) have been identified at multiple sites of -syn, influencing its conformation, aggregation and function. Here, we investigate how disease-related phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation at the same -syn site (S87) affect fibril structure and neuropathology. Using semi-synthesis, we obtained homogenous -syn monomer with site-specific phosphorylation (pS87) and O-GlcNAcylation (gS87) at S87, respectively. Cryo-EM analysis revealed that pS87 and gS87 -syn form two novel but distinct fibril structures. The GlcNAc situated at S87 establishes interactions with K80 and E61, inducing a unique iron-like fold with the GlcNAc molecule on the iron handle. While, phosphorylation at the same site prevents a lengthy C-terminal region including residues 73-140 from incorporating into the fibril core due to electrostatic repulsion. Instead, the N-terminal half (1-72) shapes a novel arch-like fibril structure. We further show that both pS87 and gS87 -syn fibrils display reduced neurotoxicity and propagation activity compared with unmodified -syn fibril. Our findings demonstrate that different PTMs at the same site can produce distinct fibril structures, which emphasizes the precise regulation of PTMs to amyloid fibril formation and pathology.",

    "abstract": "Urine collection is painless and offers the potential for kidney liquid-biopsy(1), which appears particularly appealing with regard to the diagnosis of kidney disease (2) and patient follow-up after renal transplantation (3). From a nephrological point of view, urinary sediment and the soluble and exosome fractions of urine constitute different biological entities. We here describe a method that allows deep profiling of the protein content of the above-mentioned three fractions of urine by quantitative data-independent label-free proteomics. The method was evaluated using 19 urine samples from the Nephrology outpatient clinic at Vienna General Hospital, comprising a diverse set of chronic kidney disease (CKD) as well as patients after kidney transplantation (NTX). Peptide separation was accomplished through 60 min active gradients. A timsTOF Pro2 mass spectrometer was operated in DIA mode. The total analysis time per urine sample (three fractions) was around four hours. We demonstrate adequate technical and experimental reproducibility. Our data suggest that the protein information content of these three fractions is diverse, strengthening the importance of separate analysis. The depth of our quantitative proteomics approach permitted a detection of proteins characteristic for different parts of the nephron, such as Podocin, CD2-AP and Podocalyxin (Podocytes), SLC22A8 and SLC22A13 (proximal tubule) and Aquaporin-2 (collecting duct), suggesting that our method is sensitive enough to detect and quantify biologically relevant proteins that might serve as potential biomarkers. To the best of our knowledge, the ability to quantify up to 4000 protein groups per urine sample and more than 6000 protein groups in total makes our strategy the deepest proteome profiling study of urine to date. In conclusion, we established a method with promising figures of merit that we consider broadly applicable and useful for future clinical biomarker research studies in urine.",

    "abstract": "Guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) are interferon-inducible GTPases that confer protective immunity against a variety of intracellular pathogens including bacteria, viruses, and protozoan parasites. GBP2 is one of the two highly inducible GBPs, yet the precise mechanisms underlying the activation and regulation of GBP2, in particular the nucleotide-induced conformational changes in GBP2, remain poorly understood. In this study, we elucidate the structural dynamics of GBP2 upon nucleotide binding through crystallographic analysis. GBP2 dimerizes upon GTP hydrolysis and returns to monomer state once GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP. By determining the crystal structures of GBP2 G domain (GBP2GD) in complex with GDP and nucleotide-free full-length GBP2, we unveil distinct conformational states adopted by the nucleotide-binding pocket and distal regions of the protein. Our findings demonstrate that the binding of GDP induces a distinct closed conformation both in the G motifs and the distal regions in the G domain. The conformational changes in the G domain are further transmitted to the C-terminal helical domain, leading to large-scale conformational rearrangements. Through comparative analysis, we identify subtle but critical differences in the nucleotide-bound states of GBP2, providing insights into the molecular basis of its dimer-monomer transition and enzymatic activity. Overall, our study expands the understanding of the nucleotide-induced conformational changes in GBP2, shedding light on the structural dynamics governing its functional versatility. These findings pave the way for future investigations aimed at elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms underlying GBP2s role in the immune response and may facilitate the development of targeted therapeutic strategies against intracellular pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Mirabegron, commonly known as \"Myrbetriq\", has been widely prescribed as a medicine for overactive bladder syndrome for over a decade. However, the structure of the drug and what conformational changes it may undergo upon binding its receptor remain unknown. In this study, we employed microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) to reveal its elusive three-dimensional (3D) structure. We find that the drug adopts two distinct conformational states (conformers) within the asymmetric unit. Analysis of hydrogen bonding and packing demonstrated that the hydrophilic groups were embedded within the crystal lattice, resulting in a hydrophobic surface and low water solubility. Structural comparison revealed the presence of trans- and cis-forms in conformers 1 and 2, respectively. Comparison of the structures of Mirabegron alone with that of the drug bound to its receptor,1 the beta 3 adrenergic receptor ({beta}3AR) suggests that the drug undergoes major conformational change to fit in the receptor agonist binding site. This research highlights the efficacy of MicroED in determining the unknown and polymorphic structures of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) directly from powders.",

    "abstract": "The DNAJ-PKAc fusion kinase is a defining feature of the adolescent liver cancer fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC). A single lesion on chromosome 19 generates this mutant kinase by creating a fused gene encoding the chaperonin binding domain of Hsp40 (DNAJ) in frame with the catalytic core of protein kinase A (PKAc). FLC tumors are notoriously resistant to standard chemotherapies. Aberrant kinase activity is assumed to be a contributing factor. Yet recruitment of binding partners, such as the chaperone Hsp70, implies that the scaffolding function of DNAJ- PKAc may also underlie pathogenesis. By combining proximity proteomics with biochemical analyses and photoactivation live-cell imaging we demonstrate that DNAJ-PKAc is not constrained by A-kinase anchoring proteins. Consequently, the fusion kinase phosphorylates a unique array of substrates. One validated DNAJ-PKAc target is the Bcl-2 associated athanogene 2 (BAG2), a co-chaperone recruited to the fusion kinase through association with Hsp70. Immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses of FLC patient samples correlate increased levels of BAG2 with advanced disease and metastatic recurrences. BAG2 is linked to Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic factor that delays cell death. Pharmacological approaches tested if the DNAJ- PKAc/Hsp70/BAG2 axis contributes to chemotherapeutic resistance in AML12DNAJ-PKAc hepatocyte cell lines using the DNA damaging agent etoposide and the Bcl-2 inhibitor navitoclax. Wildtype AML12 cells were susceptible to each drug alone and in combination. In contrast, AML12DNAJ-PKAc cells were moderately affected by etoposide, resistant to navitoclax, but markedly susceptible to the drug combination. These studies implicate BAG2 as a biomarker for advanced FLC and a chemotherapeutic resistance factor in DNAJ-PKAc signaling scaffolds.",

    "abstract": "African trypanosomes are eukaryotic parasites that exist in two main replicative forms; the procyclic form in the midgut of the insect vector, the tsetse fly Glossina spp. and the bloodstream form responsible for diseases in humans and cattle. Unlike most other eukaryotes, where mitochondria continuously fuse and divide, trypanosome mitochondria form a single and continuously interconnected network that only divides during cytokinesis. The machineries governing mitochondrial remodeling and interconnection, however, remain largely unknown. We characterize a dynamin-related protein (DRP) from T. brucei (TbDBF, previously called TbMfnL) that depicts sequence similarities with Opa1 and Mfn, mammalian DRPs involved mitochondrial fusion. We showed that TbDBF has closely related homologues in several organisms that are devoid of Mfn and Opa1, such as eukaryotes from different phyla, prokaryotes and archaea. TbDBF is the first member of this new protein family to be functionally characterized. It localizes to the mitochondrial periphery and, upon overexpression, induces a strong increase in the interconnection and branching of mitochondrial filaments in a GTPase dependent manner. Its overexpression also promotes a major increase in cellular and mitochondrial volume and an increased consumption of the two major carbon sources used by the parasite (glucose and proline), as well as ethanolamine, a precursor of phosphatidyl-ethanolamine involved in membrane biogenesis and shaping. We propose that mitochondrial TbDBF is a component of an ancestral membrane remodeling machinery that contributes to the formation of intermitochondrial connections.",

    "abstract": "Microbiology and synthetic biology depend on reverse genetic approaches to manipulate bacterial genomes; however, existing methods require molecular biology to generate genomic homology, suffer from low efficiency, and are not easily scaled to high throughput applications. To overcome these limitations, we developed a system for creating kilobase-scale genomic modifications that uses DNA oligonucleotides to direct the integration of a non-replicating plasmid. This method, Oligonucleotide Recombineering followed by Bxb-1 Integrase Targeting (ORBIT) was pioneered in Mycobacteria, and here we adapt and expand it for E. coli. Our redesigned plasmid toolkit achieved nearly 1000x higher efficiency than {lambda} Red recombination and enabled precise, stable knockouts (<134 kb) and integrations (<11 kb) of various sizes. Additionally, we constructed multi-mutants (double and triple) in a single transformation, using orthogonal attachment sites. At high throughput, we used pools of targeting oligonucleotides to knock out nearly all known transcription factor and small RNA genes, yielding accurate, genome-wide, single mutant libraries. By counting genomic barcodes, we also show ORBIT libraries can scale to thousands of unique members (>30k). This work demonstrates that ORBIT for E. coli is a flexible reverse genetic system that facilitates rapid construction of complex strains and readily scales to create sophisticated mutant libraries.",

Yet recent evidence suggests that members of the same miRNA family with high sequence similarity might have different roles and that this functional divergence might be rooted in their precursors sequence. Current knock-down strategies such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) or miRNA sponges cannot distinguish between identical or near identical miRNAs originating from different precursors to allow exploring unique functions of these miRNAs. We now develop a method based on short 2'-OMe/LNA-modified oligonucleotides to selectively target specific precursor molecules and ablate the production of individual members of miRNA families in vitro and in vivo. Using the highly conserved Xenopus miR-181a family as a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that 2'-OMe/LNA-ASOs targeting pre-miRNA apical region elicit a precursor-selective inhibition of mature miRNA-5p production. The levels of miRNAs released from the 3'-arm of these precursors are not reduced, suggesting that our approach is also arm-selective. Overall, we show that this strategy can be successfully applied in vivo to achieve high target selectivity to study identical or highly similar miRNAs stemming from different precursors.",

    "abstract": "Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is a serious pest of agricultural crops in different regions of the world. Destruxin A (DA) is one of 39 derivatives of destruxins, which are secondary metabolites produced by entomopathogenic fungi. Due to the high insecticidal activity, DA have great application potential in biological control of B. tabaci. In order to understand the impact of destruxin A on the energy substances of the global pest B. tabaci, we measured the changes in energy substance content of the B. tabaci adults treated with DA at LC10 and LC50 concentrations after 4, 8, and 12 hours. The results revealed that DA caused varying degrees of decline in trehalose, soluble sugars, and glycogen content, indicating its ability to influence the energy substance content of whiteflies. After DA treatment, the content of trehalose in B. tabaci decreased significantly, while the activity of trehalase, a specific hydrolase for trehalose, increased significantly. Further study of the expression levels of two genes (BtTre-1 and BtTre-2) encoding trehalases in B. tabaci after DA treatment showed that the soluble trehalase gene, BtTre-1, was induced in both low and high concentrations of DA, while the membrane-bound trehalase gene, BtTre-2, did not show significant changes in expression level.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous tags have become invaluable tools to visualize and study native proteins in live cells. However, generating human cell lines carrying endogenous tags is difficult due to the low efficiency of homology-directed repair. Recently, an engineered split mNeonGreen protein was used to generate a large-scale endogenous tag library in HEK293 cells. Using split mNeonGreen for large-scale endogenous tagging in human iPSCs would open the door to studying protein function in healthy cells and across differentiated cell types. We engineered an iPS cell line to express the large fragment of the split mNeonGreen protein (mNG21-10) and showed that it enables fast and efficient endogenous tagging of proteins with the short fragment (mNG211). We also demonstrate that neural network-based image restoration enables live imaging studies of highly dynamic cellular processes such as cytokinesis in iPSCs. This work represents the first step towards a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells.",

    "abstract": "Many double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses undergo a capsid maturation process during assembly of infectious virus particles, which involves transformation of a metastable capsid precursor called procapsid into a stable, DNA-filled capsid usually with a larger size and a more angular shape. Sf6 is a tailed dsDNA bacteriophage that infects Shigella flexneri. The phage Sf6 capsid protein gp5 was heterologously expressed and purified. Electron microscopy showed that the gp5 spontaneously assembled into spherical, procapsid-like particles. We also observed tube-like and cone-shaped particles reminiscent of human immunodeficiency virus. The gp5 procapsid-like particles were crystallized and crystals diffracted beyond 4.3 [A] resolution. X-ray data at 5.9 [A] resolution were collected with a completeness of 31.1% and an overall Rmerge of 15.0%. The crystals belong to the space group C2 with unit cell dimensions of a=973.326 [A], b=568.234 [A], c=565.567 [A], and {beta}=120.540{degrees}. Self-rotation function showed the 532 symmetry, confirming formation of icosahedral particles. The particle was situated at the origin of the crystal unit cell with the icosahedral 2-fold axis coinciding with the crystallographic b axis, and there is a half of the icosahedral particle in the crystallographic asymmetric unit.",

    "abstract": "RfaH, a paralog of the universally conserved NusG, binds to RNA polymerases (RNAP) and ribosomes to activate expression of virulence genes. In free, autoinhibited RfaH, an -helical KOW domain sequesters the RNAP-binding site. Upon recruitment to RNAP paused at an ops site, KOW is released and refolds into a {beta}-barrel, which binds the ribosome. Our structures of ops-paused transcription elongation complexes alone and bound to the autoinhibited and activated RfaH reveal swiveled, pre-translocated pause states stabilized by an ops hairpin in the non-template DNA. Autoinhibited RfaH binds and twists the ops hairpin, expanding the RNA:DNA hybrid to 11 base pairs and triggering the KOW release. Once activated, RfaH hyper-stabilizes the pause, which thus requires anti-backtracking factors for escape. Our results suggest that the entire RfaH cycle is solely determined by the ops and RfaH sequences and provide insights into mechanisms of recruitment and metamorphosis of NusG homologs across all life.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS- The nontemplate DNA strand of an ops-paused transcription complex forms a hairpin\n- Autoinhibited RfaH binds and twists the ops hairpin to expand the RNA:DNA hybrid\n- RfaH-hairpin contacts are solely responsible for triggering RfaH activation\n- Upon recruitment, RfaH hyper-stabilizes the pause and promotes RNAP backtracking",

    "abstract": "With the advent of AlphaFold, protein structure prediction has attained remarkable accuracy. These achievements resulted from a focus on single static structures. The next frontier in this field involves enhancing our ability to model conformational ensembles, not just the ground states of proteins. Notably, deposited structures result from interpretation of density maps, which are derived from either X-ray crystallography or cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These maps represent ensemble averages, reflecting molecules in multiple conformations. Here, we present the latest developments in qFit, an automated computational approach to model protein conformational heterogeneity into density maps. We present algorithmic advancements to qFit, validated by improved Rfree and geometry metrics across a broad and diverse set of proteins. Automated multiconformer modeling holds significant promise for interpreting experimental structural biology data and for generating novel hypotheses linking macromolecular conformational dynamics to function.",

    "abstract": "The cyanobacterial circadian clock is an extensive regulator of gene expression, generating a 24-hour rhythm in the majority of genes in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. This raises the question of how the cyanobacterial clock regulates, and receives input from, the diverse cellular processes it controls. Alternative sigma factors, which bind to the core RNA polymerase enzyme and direct the synthesis of specific sets of transcripts, are one mechanism for the clock to set the time of its outputs. In this work, we use single-cell time-lapse microscopy to reveal the transcriptional dynamics of RpoD4, an alternative sigma factor that was previously reported as either arrhythmic or circadian. We find instead that RpoD4 pulses at cell division, dynamics missed by previous bulk averaging. The circadian clock modulates the amplitude of RpoD4 expression pulses, as well as the timing of pulses through its control of division timing. In turn, a rpoD4 mutation causes a reduction in clock period. Further, a rpoD4 mutant results in smaller cell size, and increasing expression of RpoD4 results in larger cell sizes in a dose-response manner, allowing tunable control of cell size. Thus, our single-cell analysis has revealed pulsing gene expression dynamics in cyanobacteria, linking the clock, RpoD4 and the cell cycle.",

    "abstract": "Binary feedback, providing information solely about task success or failure, can be sufficient to drive motor learning. While binary feedback can induce explicit adjustments in movement strategy, it remains unclear if this type of feedback also induce implicit learning. We examined this question in a center-out reaching task by gradually moving an invisible reward zone away from a visual target to a final rotation of 7.5{degrees} or 25{degrees} in a between-group design. Participants received binary feedback, indicating if the movement intersected the reward zone. By the end of the training, both groups modified their reach angle by about 95% of the rotation. We quantified implicit learning by measuring performance in a subsequent no-feedback aftereffect phase, in which participants were told to forgo any adopted movement strategies and reach directly to the visual target. The results showed a small, but robust (2-3{degrees}) aftereffect in both groups, highlighting that binary feedback elicits implicit learning. Notably, for both groups, reaches to two flanking generalization targets were biased in the same direction as the aftereffect. This pattern is at odds with the hypothesis that implicit learning is a form of use-dependent learning. Rather, the results suggest that binary feedback can be sufficient to recalibrate a sensorimotor map.",

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is known to exhibit a more rapid expansion in brain structure during the early years of life compared to typically developing children (TD). This is of utmost importance in understanding atypical brain development and forecasting the onset of ASD. However, the precise age-related cortical changes (trajectories) that could pinpoint atypical brain development in ASD remain largely unknown. In this study, we characterize the distinct developmental patterns of cortical morphology in individuals with ASD, investigate the important neural biomarkers for ASD diagnostics, and propose a deep-learning workflow that combined graph convolutional networks with low-rank multi-model tensor fusion (LMFGCN) for ASD prediction. Our findings reveal that the constituents of gray matter volume (GV), cortical thickness (CT), and surface area (SA) exhibit separable developmental trajectories in ASD. Furthermore, we identify regional differences in CT and SA that underscore the separable brain developmental trajectories, both of which contribute to changes in GV. Our study also demonstrates that LMFGCN, an end-to-end deep-learning model with intermediate integrative approach, outperforms early and late integration methods and other state-of-the-art models in ASD classification. Overall, our results highlight the importance of distinguishing between cortical SA and CT for understanding ASD pathobiology, particularly during the early brain overgrowth period, and demonstrate the potential utility of LMFGCN in ASD classification.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine release in striatal circuits, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), tracks separable features of reward such as motivation and reinforcement. However, the cellular and circuit mechanisms by which dopamine receptors transform dopamine release into distinct constructs of reward remain unclear. Here, we show that dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) signaling in the NAc drives motivated behavior by regulating local NAc microcircuits. Furthermore, D3Rs co-express with dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs), which regulate reinforcement, but not motivation. Paralleling dissociable roles in reward function, we report non-overlapping physiological actions of D3R and D1R signaling in NAc neurons. Our results establish a novel cellular framework wherein dopamine signaling within the same NAc cell type is physiologically compartmentalized via actions on distinct dopamine receptors. This structural and functional organization provides neurons in a limbic circuit with the unique ability to orchestrate dissociable aspects of reward-related behaviors that are relevant to the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.",
