    "abstract": "Iron is a critical element used for survival of both host and pathogens. Tuberculosis patients show dysregulated iron metabolism and provide an opportunity for developing host directed therapeutics. In this study, C57BL/6 mice supplemented with ferric carboxymaltose and controls were aerosol infected with 100-120 CFU of the H37Rv strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A subgroup of mice received deferoxamine (DFO) with or without isoniazid and rifampicin. The iron supplemented C57BL/6 mice showed higher tissue mycobacterial burden at 2 weeks of post infection. The efficacy of isoniazid and rifampicin was compromised in iron supplemented C57BL/6 mice. Iron chelation by deferoxamine (DFO) alone for a month significantly reduced the tissue mycobacterial burden but was less effective in the iron-supplemented group. DFO as an adjunct to isoniazid and rifampicin cleared the tissue mycobacteria more efficiently. Currently, DFO is used for treating acute iron poisoning and iron overloaded thalassemic patients and holds promise as an adjunct therapeutic agent for TB.",

    "abstract": "Increasing environmental concentrations of metals as a result of anthropogenic pollution are significantly changing many microbial communities. While there is evidence metal pollution can result in increased antibiotic resistance, the effects of metal pollution on virulence remains largely undetermined. Here, we experimentally test whether metal stress alters the virulence of bacterial communities. We do this by incubating three wastewater influent communities under different environmentally relevant copper concentrations for three days. We then quantify the virulence of the community using the Galleria mellonella infection model, and test if differences are due to changes in the rate of biomass accumulation (productivity), copper resistance, or community composition (quantified using 16S amplicon sequencing). The virulence of the communities was found to be reduced by the highest copper concentration, but not to be affected by the lower concentration. As well as reduced virulence, communities exposed to the highest copper concentration were less diverse and had lower productivity. This work highlights that metal pollution may decrease virulence in bacterial communities, but at a cost to diversity and productivity.",

    "abstract": "Melioidosis is an often-fatal neglected tropical disease caused by an environmental bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. However, our understanding of disease-causing bacterial lineages, dissemination, and their adaptive mechanisms remains limited. To address this, we conducted comprehensive genomic analysis of 1,265 B. pseudomallei isolates collected from nine hospitals in northeast Thailand between 2015 and 2018, presenting the most densely sampled collection to date. Our study identified four dominant lineages with unique gene sets enhancing bacterial fitness, indicating lineage-specific co-colonisation strategies. Crucially, recombination was found to drive lineage-specific gene flow. Transcriptome analysis of a representative isolate from one lineage revealed upregulation of lineage-specific genes under nutrient-depletion. Our study also demonstrated the impact of river systems, monsoons, and typhoons in shaping the geographical dispersal of B. pseudomallei. Collectively, our findings underscore the importance of bacterial persistence in the environment as a prelude to exposure and infection, thereby providing insights for melioidosis prevention and control strategies.",

    "abstract": "The development of a cross-protective pan-influenza A vaccine remains a significant challenge. In this study, we designed and evaluated single-component self-assembling protein nanoparticles (SApNPs) presenting the conserved extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) as vaccine candidates against influenza A viruses. The SApNP-based vaccine strategy was first validated for human M2e (hM2e) and then applied to tandem repeats of M2e from human, avian and swine hosts (M2ex3). Vaccination with M2ex3 displayed on SApNPs demonstrated higher survival rates and lower weight loss compared to the soluble M2ex3 antigen against lethal challenges of H1N1 and H3N2 in mice. M2ex3 I3-01v9a SApNPs formulated with a squalene-based adjuvant were retained in the lymph node follicles over eight weeks and induced long-lived germinal center reactions. Notably, a single low dose of M2ex3 I3-01v9a SApNP formulated with a potent adjuvant, either a Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist or a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist, conferred 90% protection against a lethal H1N1 challenge in mice. With the ability to induce robust and durable M2e-specific functional antibody and T cell responses, the M2ex3-presenting I3-01v9a SApNP provides a promising pan-influenza A vaccine candidate.",

    "abstract": "Hepatic overexpression of the thrombospondin 2 gene (THBS2) and elevated levels of circulating thrombospondin 2 (TSP2) have been observed in patients with chronic liver disease. The current study aimed to identify the specific cells expressing THBS2/TSP2 in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and investigate the underlying mechanism behind THBS2/TSP2 up-regulation. Comprehensive NAFLD liver gene datasets, including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), in-house NAFLD liver tissue, and LX-2 cells derived from human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), were analyzed using a combination of computational biology, genetic, immunological, and pharmacological approaches. Analysis of the genetic dataset revealed the presence of 1433 variable genes in patients with advanced fibrosis NAFLD, with THBS2 ranked among the top 2 genes. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction examination of NAFLD livers showed a significant correlation between THBS2 expression and fibrosis stage (r=0.349, p<0.001). In support of this, scRNA-seq data and in situ hybridization demonstrated that the THBS2 gene was highly expressed in HSCs of NAFLD patients with advanced fibrosis. Pathway analysis of the gene dataset revealed THBS2 expression to be associated with the transforming growth factor beta (TGF{beta}) pathway and collagen gene activation. Moreover, the activation of LX-2 cells with TGF{beta} increased THBS2/TSP2 and collagen expression independently of the TGF{beta}-SMAD2/3 pathway. THBS2 gene knockdown significantly decreased collagen expression in LX-2 cells. In conclusion, THBS2/TSP2 is highly expressed in HSCs and plays a role in regulating fibrogenesis in NAFLD patients. THBS2/TSP2 may therefore represent a potential target for anti-fibrotic therapy in NAFLD.

    "abstract": "Antibodies are critical reagents to detect and characterize proteins. It is commonly understood that many commercial antibodies do not recognize their intended targets, but information on the scope of the problem remains largely anecdotal, and as such, feasibility of the goal of at least one potent and specific antibody targeting each protein in a proteome cannot be assessed. Focusing on antibodies for human proteins, we have scaled a standardized characterization approach using parental and knockout cell lines (Laflamme et al., 2019) to assess the performance of 614 commercial antibodies for 65 neuroscience-related proteins. Side-by-side comparisons of all antibodies against each target, obtained from multiple commercial partners, demonstrates that: i) more than 50% of all antibodies failed in one or more tests, ii) yet, [~]50-75% of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, depending on application, suggesting that coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies is significant; and iii) recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. The hundreds of underperforming antibodies identified in this study were found to have been used in a large number of published articles, which should raise alarm. Encouragingly, more than half of the underperforming commercial antibodies were reassessed by the manufacturers, and many had alterations to their recommended usage or were removed from the market. This first such study helps demonstrate the scale of the antibody specificity problem but also suggests an efficient strategy toward achieving coverage of the human proteome; mine the existing commercial antibody repertoire, and use the data to focus new renewable antibody generation efforts.",

    "abstract": "Heterologous protein production is often required to investigate the structural, biochemical, and biophysical properties of a protein of interest. Frequently, optimisation of expression conditions is required to obtain soluble protein and maximise yield. Trialling a variety of solubility and purification tags, as well as constructs containing different regulatory elements, is desirable. Golden Gate cloning allows modular assembly of different constructs using Type IIS restriction enzymes. The pOPIN vector suite, which utilises the T7 expression system, has been adapted to be compatible with Golden Gate assembly. Here, we present the pOPARA vectors. Expression from pOPARA vectors is driven by the araBAD promoter (pBAD) and is induced by addition of arabinose to the culture medium. pOPARA allows modular assembly of expression constructs using Golden Gate cloning with the CDS of interest and an optional C-terminal tag. pOPARA1 contains a carbenicillin resistance cassette flanked by restriction sites to allow exchange of the selectable markers. In pOPARA2, the carbenicillin resistance cassette has been exchanged for a spectinomycin resistance cassette. We demonstrate that both vectors can be used to express and produce a control protein.",

Tools to visualize such complexes at nanometer resolution via iterative alignment and averaging are well-developed but rely on assumptions of structural homogeneity among the complexes under consideration. Recently developed downstream analysis tools allow for some assessment of macromolecular diversity but have limited capacity to represent highly heterogeneous macromolecules, including those undergoing continuous conformational changes. Here, we extend the highly expressive cryoDRGN deep learning architecture, originally created for cryo-electron microscopy single particle analysis, to sub-tomograms. Our new tool, tomoDRGN, learns a continuous low-dimensional representation of structural heterogeneity in cryo-ET datasets while also learning to reconstruct a large, heterogeneous ensemble of structures supported by the underlying data. Using simulated and experimental data, we describe and benchmark architectural choices within tomoDRGN that are uniquely necessitated and enabled by cryo-ET data. We additionally illustrate tomoDRGNs efficacy in analyzing an exemplar dataset, using it to reveal extensive structural heterogeneity among ribosomes imaged in situ.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMolecular surveillance of infectious diseases allows the monitoring of pathogens beyond the granularity of traditional epidemiological approaches and is well-established for some of the most relevant infectious diseases such as malaria. The presence of genetically distinct pathogenic variants within an infection, referred to as multiplicity of infection (MOI) or complexity of infection (COI) is common in malaria and similar infectious diseases. It is an important metric that scales with transmission intensities, potentially affects the clinical pathogenesis, and a confounding factor when monitoring the frequency and prevalence of pathogenic variants. Several statistical methods exist to estimate MOI and the frequency distribution of pathogen variants. However, a common problem is the quality of the underlying molecular data. If molecular assays fail not randomly, it is likely to underestimate MOI and the prevalence of pathogen variants.\n\nMethods and findingsA statistical model is introduced which explicitly addresses data quality, by assuming a probability by which a pathogen variant remains undetected in a molecular assay. This is different from the assumption of missing at random, for which a molecular assay either performs perfectly or fails completely. The method is applicable to a single molecular marker and allows to estimate allele-frequency spectra, the distribution of MOI, and the probability of variants to remain undetected (incomplete information). Based on the statistical model, expressions for the prevalence of pathogen variants are derived and differences between frequency and prevalence are discussed. The usual desirable asymptotic properties of the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) are established by rewriting the model into an exponential family. The MLE has promising finite sample properties in terms of bias and variance. The covariance matrix of the estimator is close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (inverse Fisher information). Importantly, the estimators variance is larger than that of a similar method which disregards incomplete information, but its bias is smaller.\n\nConclusionsAlthough the model introduced here has convenient properties, in terms of the mean squared error it does not outperform a simple standard method that neglects missing information. Thus, the new method is recommendable only for data sets in which the molecular assays produced poor quality results. This will be particularly true if the model is extended to accommodate information from multiple molecular markers at the same time, and incomplete information at one or more markers leads to strong depletion of sample size.",

    "abstract": "Genome architecture is regulated by chromatin insulator proteins, and misregulation of insulator function is associated with genome instability and transcriptional regulatory defects in both vertebrates and Drosophila. Indeed, mutations of the sole insulator protein in humans, CTCF, are carcinogenic and mutations in the Drosophila insulator protein Suppressor of Hairy wing [Su(Hw)] lead to chromosomal rearrangements. However, the mechanism that links the DNA damage response and the regulation of transcription with insulator function is not yet understood. Here we show that enrichment of Su(Hw) insulator proteins at insulator sites increases after DNA damage. Additionally, Su(Hw) is necessary for phosphorylation of the histone variant H2Av in response to both UV treatment and X-ray irradiation. The requirement of Su(Hw) for H2Av phosphorylation appears to be tissue-specific, since H2Av is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage also in neurons, where Su(Hw) is not normally expressed. Similarly, we provide evidence that Su(Hw) and H2Av work together to ensure proper development of the lymph gland in Drosophila larvae. We show that H2Av regulates formation of the larval lymph gland, and mutation of H2Av causes formation of large melanotic tumors that are rescued by mutation of su(Hw) in the His2Av810 mutant background. Double mutants of su(Hw)- and His2Av810 also form supernumerary lymph gland lobes that are larger than in wild type. Our findings support a role for the Su(Hw) in the DNA damage response through the regulation of H2Av phosphorylation and suggest that Su(Hw) and H2Av also work together to ensure proper development of the lymph gland.",
