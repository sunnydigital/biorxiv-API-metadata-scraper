    "abstract": "Across microbiome studies, fecal and oral samples are stored and processed in different ways, which could affect the observed microbiome composition. Here, we compared treatment methods, which included both storage conditions and processing methods, applied to samples prior to DNA extraction to determine how each affects microbial community diversity as assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We collected dental swab, saliva, and fecal samples from 10 individuals, with three technical replicates per treatment method. We assessed four methods of processing fecal samples prior to DNA extraction. We also compared different fractions of frozen saliva and dental samples to fresh samples. We found that lyophilized fecal samples, fresh whole saliva samples, and the supernatant fraction of thawed dental samples retained the highest levels of alpha diversity in samples. The supernatant fraction of thawed saliva samples had the second highest alpha diversity compared to fresh. Then we investigated the differences in microbes between different treatments at the domain and phylum levels as well as identified the amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) that were significantly different between the methods producing the highest alpha diversity and the other treatment methods. Lyophilized fecal samples had a greater prevalence of Archaea as well as a greater ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes compared to the other treatment methods. Our results provide practical considerations, not only for selection of processing method, but also for comparing results across studies that use these methods. Our findings also indicate differences in treatment method could be a confounding factor influencing the presence, absence, or differential abundance of microbes reported in conflicting studies.",

    "abstract": "Codon optimality refers to the effect codon composition has on messenger RNA (mRNA) stability and translation level and implies that synonymous codons are not silent from a regulatory point of view. Here, we investigated the adaptation of virus genomes to the host optimality code using mosquito-borne dengue virus (DENV) as a model. We defined which codons are associated with unstable and stable (non-optimal and optimal codons, respectively) mRNAs in mosquito cells and showed that DENV preferentially uses non-optimal codons and avoids codons that are defined as optimal in either human or mosquito cells. Human genes enriched in the codons preferentially and frequently used by DENV are up-regulated during infection, and so is the tRNA decoding the non-optimal and DENV preferentially used codon for arginine. We found that synonymous mutations towards DENVs preferred non-optimal codons (e.g., AGA) increase fitness of DENV during serial passaging in human or mosquito cells. Finally, our analyses revealed that hundreds of viruses preferentially use non-optimal codons, with those infecting a single host displaying an even stronger bias, suggesting that synonymous codon choice is a key aspect of host-pathogen interaction.",

    "abstract": "The peripheral nerves (PNs) innervate the dermis and epidermis, which have been suggested to play an important role in wound healing. Several methods to quantify skin innervation during wound healing have been reported. Those usually require multiple observers, are complex and labor-intensive, and noise/background associated with the Immunohistochemistry (IHC) images could cause quantification errors/user bias. In this study, we employed the state-of-the-art deep neural network, DnCNN, to perform pre-processing and effectively reduce the noise in the IHC images. Additionally, we utilized an automated image analysis tool, assisted by Matlab, to accurately determine the extent of skin innervation during various stages of wound healing. The 8mm wound is generated using a circular biopsy punch in the wild-type mouse. Skin samples were collected on days 3,7,10 and 15, and sections from paraffin-embedded tissues were stained against pan-neuronal marker- protein-gene-product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) antibody. On day 3 and day 7, negligible nerve fibers were present throughout the wound with few only on the lateral boundaries of the wound. On day 10, a slight increase in nerve fiber density appeared, which significantly increased on day 15. Importantly we found a positive correlation (R-2 = 0.933) between nerve fiber density and re-epithelization, suggesting an association between re-innervation and re-epithelization. These results established a quantitative time course of re-innervation in wound healing, and the automated image analysis method offers a novel and useful tool to facilitate the quantification of innervation in the skin and other tissues.",

    "abstract": "The RAVER1 protein was proposed to serve as a co-factor in guiding the PTBP-dependent control of alternative splicing (AS). Whether RAVER1 solely acts in concert with PTBPs and how it affects cancer cell fate remained elusive. Here we provide the first comprehensive investigation of RAVER1-controlled AS in cancer cell models and reveal a pro-oncogenic role of RAVER1 in tumor growth. This unravels that RAVER1 guides AS in synergy with PTBPs but more prominently serves PTBP1-independent roles in splicing. In cancer cells, one major function of RAVER1 is the control of proliferation and apoptosis, which involves the modulation of AS events within the miR/RISC pathway. Associated with this regulatory role, RAVER1 antagonizes lethal, TGFB-driven epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) by limiting TGFB signaling. RAVER1-modulated splicing events affect the insertion of protein interaction modules in factors guiding miR/RISC-dependent gene silencing. Most prominently, in all three human TNRC6 proteins, RAVER1 controls AS of GW-enriched motifs, which are essential for AGO2-binding. Disturbance of RAVER1-guided AS events in TNRC6 proteins and other facilitators of miR/RISC activity compromise miR/RISC activity which is essential to restrict TGFB signaling and lethal EMT.",

    "abstract": "Abasic sites are common DNA lesions that stall polymerases and threaten genome stability. When located in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), they are shielded from aberrant processing by HMCES via a DNA-protein crosslink (DPC) that prevents double-strand breaks. Nevertheless, the HMCES-DPC must be removed to complete DNA repair. Here, we found that DNA polymerase  inhibition generates ssDNA abasic sites and HMCES-DPCs. These DPCs are resolved with a half-life of approximately 1.5 hours. Resolution does not require the proteasome or SPRTN protease. Instead, HMCES-DPC self-reversal is important for resolution. Biochemically, self-reversal is favored when the ssDNA is converted to duplex DNA. When the self-reversal mechanism is inactivated, HMCES-DPC removal is delayed, cell proliferation is slowed, and cells become hypersensitive to DNA damage agents that increase AP site formation. Thus, HMCES-DPC formation followed by self-reversal is an important mechanism for ssDNA AP site management.",

    "abstract": "The WASH1 gene produces a protein that forms part of the developmentally important WASH complex. The WASH complex activates the Arp2/3 complex to initiate branched actin networks at the surface of endosomes. As a curiosity, the human reference gene set includes nine WASH1 genes. How many of these are pseudogenes and how many are bona fide coding genes is not clear.\n\nEight of the nine WASH1 genes reside in rearrangement and duplication-prone subtelomeric regions. Many of these subtelomeric regions had gaps in the GRCh38 human genome assembly, but the recently published T2T-CHM13 assembly from the Telomere to Telomere (T2T) Consortium has filled in the gaps. As a result, the T2T Consortium has added four new WASH1 paralogues in previously unannotated subtelomeric regions.\n\nHere we show that one of these four novel WASH1 genes, LOC124908094, is the gene most likely to produce the functional WASH1 protein. We also demonstrate that the other twelve WASH1 genes derived from a single WASH8P pseudogene on chromosome 12. These 12 genes include WASHC1, the gene currently annotated as the functional WASH1 gene.\n\nWe propose LOC124908094 should be annotated as a coding gene and all functional information relating to the WASHC1 gene on chromosome 9 should be transferred to LOC124908094. The remaining WASH1 genes, including WASHC1, should be annotated as pseudogenes. This work confirms that the T2T assembly has added at least one functionally relevant coding gene to the human reference set. It remains to be seen whether other important coding genes are missing from the GRCh38 reference assembly.",

    "abstract": "TnpB proteins are RNA-guided nucleases that are broadly associated with IS200/605 family transposons in prokaryotes. TnpB homologs, named Fanzors, have been detected in genomes of some eukaryotes and large viruses, but their activity and functions in eukaryotes remain unknown. We searched genomes of diverse eukaryotes and their viruses for TnpB homologs and identified numerous putative RNA-guided nucleases that are often associated with various transposases, suggesting they are encoded in mobile genetic elements. Reconstruction of the evolution of these nucleases, which we rename Horizontally-transferred Eukaryotic RNA-guided Mobile Element Systems (HERMES), revealed multiple acquisitions of TnpBs by eukaryotes and subsequent diversification. In their adaptation and spread in eukaryotes, HERMES proteins acquired nuclear localization signals, and genes captured introns, indicating extensive, long term adaptation to functioning in eukaryotic cells. Biochemical and cellular evidence show that HERMES employ non-coding RNAs encoded adjacent to the nuclease for RNA-guided cleavage of double-stranded DNA. HERMES nucleases contain a re-arranged catalytic site of the RuvC domain, similar to a distinct subset of TnpBs, and lack collateral cleavage activity. We demonstrate that HERMES can be harnessed for genome editing in human cells, highlighting the potential of these widespread eukaryotic RNA-guided nucleases for biotechnology applications.",

    "abstract": "The initial steps of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) lifecycle are regulated by cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). To understand the scope of these early host-virus interactions, we developed in virion RNA interactome capture (ivRIC), which allowed the comprehensive and systematic profiling of the proteins that interact with the HIV-1 genomic (g)RNA inside viral particles. ivRIC identified 104 cellular RBPs within the encapsidated HIV-1 ribonucleoprotein, many of which are typically found in the cellular nucleus. Notably, these nuclear RBPs interact with the HIV-1 RBP Rev, suggesting that they associate with HIV-1 gRNA during its nuclear life. Functional assays show that ivRBPs are important for HIV-1, including PURA and PURB, which control viral gene expression and infectivity through interaction with critical sequences in the gRNA. Our characterisation of the composition of the encapsidated ribonucleoprotein of HIV-1 uncovers new host-virus interactions that invokes new mechanisms for controlling HIV-1 infection.",

    "abstract": "It is now widely accepted that aberrant splicing of constitutive exons is often caused by mutations affecting cis-acting splicing regulatory elements (SREs), but there is a misconception that all exons have an equal dependency on SREs and thus a similar vulnerability to aberrant splicing. We demonstrate that some exons are more likely to be affected by exonic splicing mutations (ESM) due to an inherent vulnerability, which is context-dependent and influenced by the strength of exon definition. We have developed VulExMap, a tool which based on empirical data that can designate whether a constitutive exon is vulnerable. Using VulExMap, we find that only 27% of all exons can be categorized as vulnerable whereas two-thirds of 332 previously reported ESMs in 71 disease genes are located in vulnerable exons. Because VulExMap analysis is based on empirical data on splicing of exons in their endogenous context, it includes all features important in determining the vulnerability. We believe that VulExMap will be an important tool when assessing the effect of exonic mutations by pinpointing whether they are located in exons vulnerable to ESMs.",
