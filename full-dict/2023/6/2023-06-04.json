    "abstract": "SummaryFungi naturally inhabit the human microbiome and can be causative agents of infections. Hence, an accurate and robust method for fungal ITS classification can help us gain a deeper insight into the dynamics of environmental communities and ultimately comprehend whether the abundance of certain species correlate with health and disease. Therefore, in this work we introduce HiTaC, a robust hierarchical machine learning model for accurate ITS classification. HiTaC is implemented as a QIIME2 plugin in order to facilitate its adoption in existing mycobiome analysis pipelines. We benchmarked it with seventeen popular software for taxonomic classification on real environmental sequencing data. HiTaC shows superior accuracy and sensitivity in classifying ITS sequences across different taxonomic ranks.\n\nAvailability and implementationHiTaC is freely available on GitLab https://gitlab.com/dacs-hpi/hitac\n\nContactvitor.piro@fu-berlin.de\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at bioRxiv online.",

    "abstract": "Shock-and-kill is one of the most advanced, yet unrealized, concepts towards establishment of HIV-1 cure. Treatment with latency-reversing agents (LRAs), including histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) exerting chromatin remodelling and gene expression reprogramming, combined with anti-retroviral therapy reactivates HIV-1 transcription in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. However, LRA treatment so far failed to significantly reduce the size of the viral reservoir in people living with HIV-1 (PLHIV), indicating its insufficiency in terms of elimination of latently infected cells. Here, by combining single cell RNA-sequencing and functional approaches, we characterised HDACi treatment-induced alterations of CD4+ T-cell subset composition, subpopulation-specific transcriptional profiles, and HIV-1 reactivation, using Vorinostat and Panobinostat as two prototypic HDACis. Ex vivo exposure of CD4+ T-cells from three aviremic PLHIV with clinically applicable concentrations of Panobinostat, but not Vorinostat, markedly reduced the expression and functionality of genes mediating antiviral immunity and T-cell activation. These modulations occurred in a CD4+ T-cell subset-specific manner, with an PLHIV-specific exhausted CD4+ T-cell subset that was to a certain extent refractory to said gene modulations. Furthermore, specific cellular genes were differentially expressed in the small HIV-1 RNA-positive fraction of CD4+ T-cells from PLHIV. In latently HIV-1-infected J1.1 T-cells, specific genes correlated positively and negatively with the abundance of HIV-1 transcripts at the single cell level. In sum, we present LRA treatment-imposed gene expression changes and their functional implications, and present a list of gene candidates that may serve as biomarkers of T-cells with active HIV-1 transcription.",

    "abstract": "Engineered heart tissues have been created to study cardiac biology and disease in a setting that more closely mimics in-vivo heart muscle than 2D monolayer culture. Previously published studies suggest that geometrically anisotropic micro-environments are crucial for inducing \"in vivo-like\" physiology from immature cardiomyocytes. We hypothesized that such anisotropic tissue geometries regulate tissue prestress, and that in turn this prestress is a major factor regulating cardiomyocytes electrophysiological development. Thus, we studied the effects of tissue geometry on electrophysiology of micro-heart muscle arrays (HM) engineered from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Geometries predicted to increase tissue prestress not only affected cardiomyocyte structure, but also had profound effects on electrophysiology.\n\nElongated geometries led to adaptations that yielded increased calcium intake during each contraction cycle. Strikingly, pharmacologic studies revealed a prestress threshold is required for sodium channel function, whereas L-type calcium and rapidly-rectifying potassium channels were largely insensitive. Analysis of RNA and protein levels suggest sodium channel activity changes were related to post-transcriptional, and potentially post-translational, changes. HM formed from Plakophilin 2 (PKP2) knockout iPSC had a cellular structure similar to isogenic controls.\n\nHowever, these tissues exhibited no functional sodium current and an overall lesser degree of electrical remodeling in response to prestress. These results suggest that PKP2, a key component of the nascent desmosome, is crucial to transducing tissue prestress into physiologically beneficial electrical remodeling via activation of sodium channels.",

It is therefore unclear how well a model chosen by an experimenter can relate neural activity to experimental conditions.

Although flexible, CNNs are difficult to interpret. We use Taylor decomposition approaches to understand the discovered model and how it maps task features to activity. We apply MINE to a published cortical dataset as well as experiments designed to probe thermoregulatory circuits in zebrafish. MINE allowed us to characterize neurons according to their receptive field and computational complexity, features which anatomically segregate in the brain. We also identified a new class of neurons that integrate thermosensory and behavioral information which eluded us previously when using traditional clustering and regression-based approaches.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) based on model neurons that communicate via continuous signals have been widely used to study how cortical neurons perform cognitive tasks. Training such networks to perform tasks that require information maintenance over a brief period (i.e., working memory tasks) remains a challenge. Critically, the training process becomes difficult when the synaptic decay time constant is not fixed to a large constant number for all the model neurons. Here, we show that introducing random noise to the RNNs not only speeds up the training but also produces stable models that can maintain information longer than the RNNs trained without internal noise. Importantly, this robust working memory performance induced by internal noise during training is attributed to an increase in synaptic decay time constants of a distinct subset of inhibitory units, resulting in slower decay of stimulus-specific activity critical for memory maintenance.",

We find that transformed cells preferentially undergo EMT in hypoxic tumor regions in multiple model systems and that hypoxia drives a cell-autonomous EMT in PDAC cells which, unlike EMT in response to growth factors, can last for weeks. We further demonstrate that hypoxia reduces histone demethylase KDM2A activity, suppresses PP2 family phosphatase expression, and activates MAPKs to post-translationally stabilize histone methyltransferase NSD2, leading to an H3K36me2-dependent EMT in which hypoxia-inducible factors play only a supporting role. This mechanism can be antagonized in vivo by combinations of MAPK inhibitors that may be effective in multi-drug therapies designed to target EMT.",

    "abstract": "The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is a crucial experimental animal that shares many genetic, brain organizational, and behavioral characteristics with humans. A macaque brain atlas that identifies anatomically and functionally distinct regions is fundamental to biomedical and evolutionary research. However, even though connectivity information is vital for understanding brain functions, a connectivity-based whole-brain atlas of the macaque has not previously been made. In this study, we created a new whole-brain map, the Macaque Brainnetome Atlas (MacBNA), based on the anatomical connectivity profiles provided by high angular and spatial resolution ex vivo diffusion MRI data. The new atlas consists of 248 cortical and 56 subcortical regions as well as their structural and functional connections. The parcellation and the diffusion-based tractography were comprehensively evaluated with multi-contrast MRI, invasive neuronal-tracing, and Nissl-stained images collected from a single subject and with open-access datasets from other cohorts. As a demonstrative application, the structural connectivity divergence between macaque and human brains was mapped using the Brainnetome atlases of those two species to uncover the genetic underpinnings of the evolutionary changes in brain structure. The resulting resource includes (1) the thoroughly delineated Macaque Brainnetome Atlas (MacBNA), (2) regional connectivity profiles, (3) the postmortem high resolution macaque diffusion and T2-weighted MRI dataset (Brainnetome-8), and (4) multi-contrast MRI, block-face, and section images collected from a single macaque. MacBNA can serve as a common reference frame for mapping multifaceted features across modalities and spatial scales and for integrative investigation and characterization of brain organization and function. Therefore, it will enrich the collaborative resource platform for nonhuman primates and facilitate translational and comparative neuroscience research.",

    "abstract": "In budding yeast, the transcriptional repressor Opi1 regulates phospholipid biosynthesis by repressing expression of genes containing inositol-sensitive upstream activation sequences (UASINO). Upon genotoxic stress, cells activate the DNA Damage Response (DDR) to coordinate a complex network of signaling pathways aimed at preserving genomic integrity. Here, we reveal that Opi1 is important to modulate transcription in response to genotoxic stress. We find that cells lacking Opi1 exhibit hypersensitivity to genotoxins, along with a delayed G1 to S-phase transition and decreased gamma-H2A levels. Transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq reveals that Opi1 plays a central role in modulating essential biological processes during genotoxic stress induced by methyl methanesulfonate, including repression of phospholipid biosynthesis and transduction of mating signaling. Moreover, Opi1 induces sulfate assimilation and amino acid metabolic processes, such as arginine and histidine biosynthesis and glycine catabolism. Furthermore, we observe increased mitochondrial DNA instability in opi1{Delta} cells upon MMS treatment. Notably, we show that constitutive activation of the transcription factors Ino2-Ino4 is responsible for genotoxin sensitivity in Opi1-deficient cells, and the production of inositol pyrophosphates by Kcs1 counteracts Opi1 function specifically during MMS-induced genotoxic stress. Overall, our findings highlight Opi1 as a critical sensor of genotoxic stress in budding yeast, orchestrating gene expression to facilitate appropriate DNA damage response.",

It is also a common way for educational stakeholders to compare programs even if the content of the degree programs varies. But what types of behaviors and experiences are associated with faster times to degree? In this education article, we examine the relationship between receiving competitive research awards (e.g. grant writing) and time to degree for PhD students. We organize our analyses by student identities, specifically gender and underrepresented minority (URM) status, to examine differences in time to degree based on student demographics. Our dataset included students that graduated between academic years 2008-09 through 2018-19. We also interviewed students currently enrolled in these same programs. We find that URM women who won competitive research awards graduate faster than all other students who also won awards but also report lower levels of advisor support. We also find that URM women and all URM students tended to graduate faster compared to other groups of students who did not win awards. Students who reported feeling supported by their advisors, most of which reflected hands-on guidance through the writing process, in the interviews were more likely to apply for grants. Combined, these results highlight that writing grants and specific types of advisor support may influence faster times to degree for bioscience PhD students. This study suggests similar introspective analyses at other institutions and databases are needed.",

    "abstract": "Circadian behavioral rhythms in Drosophila melanogaster are regulated by about 75 pairs of brain neurons. They all express the core clock genes but have distinct functions and gene expression profiles. To understand the importance of these distinct molecular programs, neuron-specific gene manipulations are essential. Although RNAi based methods are standard to manipulate gene expression in a cell-specific manner, they are often ineffective, especially in assays involving smaller numbers of neurons or weaker Gal4 drivers. We and others recently exploited a neuron-specific CRISPR-based method to mutagenize genes within circadian neurons. Here we further explore this approach to mutagenize three well-studied clock genes: the transcription factor gene vrille, the photoreceptor gene Cryptochrome (cry) and the neuropeptide gene Pdf. The CRISPR-based strategy not only reproduced their known phenotypes but also assigned cry function for different light mediated phenotypes to discrete, different subsets of clock neurons. We further tested two recently published methods for temporal regulation in adult neurons, inducible Cas9 and auxin-inducible gene expression system (AGES). The results were not identical, but both approaches successfully showed that the adult-specific knockout of the neuropeptide Pdf reproduces the canonical loss-of-function mutant phenotypes. In summary, a CRISPR-based strategy is a highly effective, reliable, and general method to temporally manipulate gene function in specific adult neurons.\n\nSignificance statementMost animals have specific brain neurons that regulate sleep-wake cycles and other aspects of circadian behavior. Drosophila has only about 150 of these clock neurons. Despite their small numbers, they have remarkably diverse anatomy and gene expression profiles. To address the different functions of these neurons, we used highly specific and efficient CRISPR-based methods to create cell type-specific disruptions of three traditional circadian genes. We were able to assign the function of the photoreceptor cryptochrome to two tiny subsets of clock neurons. In addition, two independent methods assigned the neuropeptide PDF to the adult stage. In summary, we find that the CRISPR-based methods are very efficient at studying adult specific functions of genes in small, discrete sets of neurons.",

We introduce a simple mathematical model for BTSP and a theory that enables a principled understanding of the relations between memory traces it creates. In particular, we show that it surpasses random projections, which formed the basis for a previously considered biological algorithm, in the creation of memory traces that support similarity search. Furthermore, BTSP induces the repulsion effect for closely related memory items, a well-known fingerprint of memory organization in the human brain that could not be explained by previous models.",

    "abstract": "The cochlear nucleus (CN), the starting point for all central auditory processing, comprises a suite of neuronal cell types that are morphologically and biophysically specialized for initiating parallel pathways, yet their molecular distinctions are largely unknown. To determine how functional specialization is defined at the molecular level, we employed a single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis of the mouse CN to molecularly define its constituent cell types and then related them to well established cell types with classical approaches. We reveal a one-to-one correspondence between molecular cell types and all previously described major types, defining a cell-type taxonomy that meaningfully reconciles anatomical position, morphological, physiological, and molecular criteria. Our approach also yields continuous and/or discrete molecular distinctions within several major principal cell types that account for hitherto unresolved distinctions in their anatomical position, morphology, and physiology. This study thus provides a higher-resolution and thoroughly validated account of cellular heterogeneity and specializations in the CN from the molecular to the circuit level, opening a new window for genetic dissection of auditory processing and hearing disorders with unprecedented specificity.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale cell flow characterizes gastrulation in animal development. In amniote gastrulation, a bilateral vortex-like counter-rotating cell flow, called  polonaise movements, appears along the midline. Here, through experimental manipulations, we addressed relationships between the polonaise movements and morphogenesis of the primitive streak, the earliest midline structure in amniotes. Suppression of the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway maintains the polonaise movements along a deformed primitive streak. Mitotic arrest leads to diminished extension and development of the primitive streak and maintains the early phase of the polonaise movements. Ectopically induced Vg1, an axis-inducing morphogen, generates the polonaise movements, aligned to the induced midline, but disturbs the stereotypical cell flow pattern at the authentic midline. Despite the altered cell flow, induction and extension of the primitive streak are preserved along both authentic and induced midlines. Finally, we show that ectopic axis-inducing morphogen, Vg1, is capable of initiating the polonaise movements without concomitant PS extension under mitotic arrest conditions. These results are consistent with a model wherein primitive streak morphogenesis is required for the maintenance of the polonaise movements, but the polonaise movements are not necessarily responsible for primitive streak morphogenesis. Our data describe a previously undefined relationship between the large-scale cell flow and midline morphogenesis in gastrulation.",

    "abstract": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARYO_ST_ABSBACKGROUNDC_ST_ABSCougars (Puma concolor), also known as mountain lions, pumas, catamounts, and Florida panthers, once ranged widely throughout the United States (McCollough, 2011). Following intensive human persecution, anthropogenic-driven habitat loss, and unrestricted hunting of the prey species upon which cougars depend, populations were extirpated from much of the country (Cardoza & Langolis, 2002). In the northeastern U.S. specifically, cougars were functionally extinct by the early 1900s. Recent research assessing potential habitat for cougars suggests numerous areas exist to restore the species throughout portions of their historic eastern range (Winkel et al., 2022; Yovovich et al., 2023). But are the humans inhabiting this region today supportive of cougar restoration?\n\nSTUDY OBJECTIVESThe primary goal of this study was to make a preliminary assessment of support for cougar restoration at the state level in several states deemed to have substantial habitat for cougars (i.e., Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and West Virginia). Additionally, we sought to identify individual-level correlates of support for, and opposition to, cougar restoration.\n\nSTUDY FINDINGSResults from an online survey of residents of seven eastern states with potential cougar habitat (n=2756) suggest that support for cougar restoration is much higher than opposition to cougar restoration. Ratios of strong support to strong opposition range from approximately 4:1 to 13:1. Maine has the highest ratio of strong support to strong opposition at 13:1, indicating that for every one person opposing cougar restoration in the state, we can expect 13 people to support it. Vermont and New Hampshire have the second highest ratio of strong support to strong opposition at 12:1 each. New York and Massachusetts have the second lowest ratio of strong support to strong opposition, at 5:1 each. West Virginia and Pennsylvania have the lowest ratio of strong support to strong opposition with ratios of 4:1, indicating that for every one person opposing cougar restoration in these states, we can expect 4 people to support it. Results also reveal that states with the lowest ratio of strong support to strong opposition tend to have the highest proportion of respondents expressing neutrality toward the idea of restoration.\n\nAt the individual-level, support for cougar restoration was higher among men, respondents identifying \"strongly\" or \"very strongly\" as a hunter or a conservationist, those with mutualist wildlife value orientations, urban residents, and respondents identifying as politically liberal.\n\nIMPLICATIONSGiven the current structure of wildlife management in the U.S., efforts to restore cougars throughout significant portions of their historic range will depend in large part on actions taken by state wildlife management agencies. Finding support for cougar restoration among many of the constituents for whom state wildlife agencies are expected to operate on behalf of - including both hunters and conservationists - this study offers valuable insights regarding the social feasibility of restoring cougars to the eastern U.S.\n\nImportantly, while a majority of respondents were supportive of cougar restoration, a considerable portion of the population in each state expressed neutrality toward the idea of cougar restoration. Extant research from the behavioral sciences suggests these individuals may be more likely to change their attitudes toward cougar restoration in response to new information. Whether any such change would result in greater support or greater opposition toward cougar restoration is likely dependent on several factors, including the way in which information regarding the potential risks and benefits of the species is presented (Slagle et al., 2013), as well as the source/messenger from which new information is provided (e.g., Fielding et al., 2020).\n\nCOVER IMAGEWord cloud produced from survey participant responses to free association when they think of cougars.",

    "abstract": "T cells form transient cell-to-cell contacts with antigen presenting cells (APCs) to facilitate surface interrogation by membrane bound T cell receptors (TCRs). Upon recognition of molecular signatures (antigen) of pathogen, T cells may initiate an adaptive immune response. The duration of the T cell/APC contact is observed to vary widely, yet it is unclear what constructive role, if any, such variations might play in immune signaling. Modeling efforts describing antigen discrimination often focus on steady-state approximations and do not account for the transient nature of cellular contacts. Within the framework of a kinetic proofreading (KP) mechanism, we develop a stochastic First Receptor Activation Model (FRAM) describing the likelihood that a productive immune signal is produced before the expiry of the contact. Through the use of extreme statistics, we characterize the probability that the first TCR triggering is induced by a rare agonist antigen and not by that of an abundant self-antigen. We show that defining positive immune outcomes as resilience to extreme statistics and sensitivity to rare events mitigates classic tradeoffs associated with KP. By choosing a sufficient number of KP steps, our model is able to yield single agonist sensitivity whilst remaining non-reactive to large populations of self antigen, even when self and agonist antigen are similar in dissociation rate to the TCR but differ largely in expression. Additionally, our model achieves high levels of accuracy even when agonist positive APCs encounters are rare. Finally, we discuss potential biological costs associated with high classification accuracy, particularly in challenging T cell environments.\n\nAuthor summaryPhysical contact between the T cell and antigen presenting cell (APC) is essential for productive immune signaling. Wide variations in this contact time have been observed yet little is known of mechanisms controlling this crucial timescale, nor how its duration may impact antigen discrimination. We develop and analyze a probabilistic mathematical model of T cell activation which combines kinetic proofreading (KP) with a finite contact duration. Our model is capable of suppressing large populations of self ligands while remaining sensitive to only a single agonist in T cell/APC cellular contacts. Additionally, we explored two challenging cases, one in which self and agonist antigen are similar and one in which agonist positive APCs are rare. We found that our model could overcome these environmental challenges by increasing the number of kinetic proofreading steps. Finally, we discuss the potential biological costs of achieving such accuracy. Our work demonstrates the extreme effectiveness of kinetic proofreading in a temporal context while also demonstrating the possible challenges in biological implementation of such a model.",

We identified a new population of immature preadipocytes, revealed a biased differentiation potential of progenitor cells, and identified Sox9 as a critical factor in driving progenitors toward adipose commitment, the first known mechanism of progenitor differentiation.

We demonstrate that sci-Plex and 10x methods produce highly concordant cell class compositions and then expand sci-Plex to analyze the cell class composition of 410 organoids upon modulation of critical developmental pathways. Leveraging individual organoid data, we develop a method to measure organoid heterogeneity, and we identify that activation of Wnt signaling early in retinal organoid cultures increases retinal cell classes up to six weeks later.

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the Priority Level I critical pathogens that are least sensitive to antibiotics and can cause fatal hospital-acquired infections. This bacterium is predominantly present in the agricultural ecosystem. However, there are very limited studies on health threats associated with P. aeruginosa strains flourishing in edible plants. Previously, we isolated and characterized 18 P. aeruginosa strains from vegetable plants directly harvested from the farms. In the current work, it has been hypothesized that plant-associated P. aeruginosa harbors genetic determinants for virulence and resistance. To test this hypothesis, in vitro resistome profiles of the plant-associated P. aeruginosa strains were assessed based on the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Hierarchical clustering analysis was done to identify the plant-associated strains that are phenotypically similar to clinical isolates. An eggplant-associated strain, PPA14, that exhibited high virulence and extensive in vitro resistance against eight antibiotic classes was selected for complete genome analyses. The PPA14 genome was sequenced using the Solexa-Illumina and Oxford-Nanopore platforms, assembled, and annotated. The presence of virulence-related and antibiotic resistance (ABR) genes were predicted using the ABRicate tool and validated based on standard reference databases such as VFDB, NCBI AMRFinderPlus, MEGARes, CARD, and ResFinder. IslandViewer4 tool was used to predict the genes acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Additionally, comparative analyses of all the plant-associated and environmental P. aeruginosa genomes characterized so far were done using the Roary tool. The PPA14 genome size was 6.72 Mbp, encoding 6315 open reading frames. The genome harbored 49 ABR genes, including those coding for multiple families of efflux pumps that collectively confer resistance against 11 antibiotic classes. In addition, we detected 225 virulence-related genes, 83 genomic islands, and 235 unique genes in the PPA14 genome. Over 4% of the PPA14 genome is devoted to conferring virulence and extensive drug resistance. Our report highlights the health threat associated with an eggplant-associated P. aeruginosa.",

Emerging evidence suggests that mutant HTT (mHTT) disrupts brain development. To gain mechanistic insights into the neurodevelopmental impact of human mHTT, we engineered induced pluripotent stem cells to introduce a biallelic or monoallelic mutant 70Q expansion or to remove the poly-Q tract of HTT. 70Q introduction caused aberrant development of cerebral organoids with loss of neural progenitor organization. The early neurodevelopmental signature of mHTT highlighted the dysregulation of the protein coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 2 (CHCHD2), a transcription factor involved in mitochondrial integrated stress response. CHCHD2 repression was associated with abnormal mitochondrial morpho-dynamics and elevated resting energy expenditure. Elimination of the poly-Q tract of HTT normalized CHCHD2 expression and mitochondrial defects. Hence, mHTT-mediated disruption of human neurodevelopment is paralleled by aberrant neurometabolic programming mediated by dysregulation of CHCHD2, which could then serve as an early intervention target for HD.",

Currently, no standard of care is available and there remains a dire need for new therapeutics. Most patients harbor the fusion oncogene DNAJB1-PRKACA (DP fusion), but clinical inhibitors are not yet developed and it is critical to identify downstream mediators of FLC pathogenesis. Here, we identify long non-coding RNA LINC00473 among the most highly upregulated genes in FLC tumors and determine that it is strongly suppressed by RNAi-mediated inhibition of the DP fusion in FLC tumor epithelial cells. We show by loss- and gain-of-function studies that LINC00473 suppresses apoptosis, increases the expression of FLC marker genes, and promotes FLC growth in cell-based and in vivo models of disease. Mechanistically, LINC00473 plays an important role in promoting glycolysis and altering mitochondrial activity.

    "abstract": "The association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and metabolic disorders is well-established but the underlying mechanisms that elucidate this relationship remain incompletely understood. Since the liver is a major organ in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis, we hypothesize that liver dysfunction plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Herein, we explored the underlying mechanisms of this association within the liver. Experiments were performed in male Wistar rats fed with a control or high fat (HF) diet (60% lipid-rich) for 12 weeks. Half of the groups were exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) (30 hypoxic (5% O2) cycles, 8 h/day) that mimics OSA, in the last 15 days. Insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance were assessed. Liver samples were collected for evaluation of lipid deposition, insulin signaling, glucose homeostasis, hypoxia, oxidative stress, antioxidant defenses, mitochondrial biogenesis and inflammation. Both CIH and HF diet induced dysmetabolism, a state not aggravated in animals submitted to HF plus CIH. CIH aggravates hepatic lipid deposition in obese animals. Hypoxia-inducible factors levels were altered by these stimuli. CIH decreased the levels of oxidative phosphorylation complexes in both groups and the levels of SOD-1. HF diet reduced mitochondrial density and hepatic antioxidant capacity. CIH and HF diet produced alterations in cysteine-related thiols and pro-inflammatory markers. The results obtained suggest that hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, leading to inflammation, may be significant factors contributing to the development of dysmetabolism associated with OSA.",

    "abstract": "The resting zone of the postnatal growth plate is organized by slow-cycling chondrocytes expressing parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), which include a subgroup of skeletal stem cells that contribute to the formation of columnar chondrocytes. The PTHrP-indian hedgehog (Ihh) feedback regulation is essential for sustaining growth plate activities; however, molecular mechanisms regulating cell fates of PTHrP+ resting chondrocytes and their eventual transformation into osteoblasts remain largely undefined. Here, in a mouse model, we utilized a tamoxifen-inducible PTHrP-creER line with Patched-1 (Ptch1) floxed and tdTomato reporter alleles to specifically activate Hedgehog signaling in PTHrP+ resting chondrocytes and trace the fate of their descendants. Hedgehog-activated PTHrP+ chondrocytes formed large concentric clonally expanded cell populations within the resting zone ( patched roses) and generated significantly wider columns of chondrocytes, resulting in hyperplasia of the growth plate. Interestingly, Hedgehog-activated PTHrP+ cell-descendants migrated away from the growth plate and eventually transformed into trabecular osteoblasts in the diaphyseal marrow space in the long term. Therefore, Hedgehog activation drives resting zone chondrocytes into transit-amplifying states as proliferating chondrocytes and eventually converts these cells into osteoblasts, unraveling a novel Hedgehog-mediated mechanism that facilitates osteogenic cell fates of PTHrP+ skeletal stem cells.",

The localization of synthetic or endogenous GPCR agonists impacts their action on specific neuronal pathways. In this paper, we show a series of single-protein chain integrator sensors to determine GPCR agonist localization in the whole brain. We previously engineered integrator sensors for the mu and kappa opioid receptor agonists called M- and K-SPOTIT, respectively. Here, we show a new integrator sensor design platform called SPOTall that we used to engineer sensors for the beta-2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR), the dopamine receptor D1, and the cholinergic receptor muscarinic 2 agonists. For multiplexed imaging of SPOTIT and SPOTall, we engineered a red version of the SPOTIT sensors. Finally, we used M-SPOTIT and B2AR-SPOTall to detect morphine, isoproterenol, and epinephrine in the mouse brain. The SPOTIT and SPOTall sensor design platform can be used to design a variety of GPCR integrator sensors for unbiased agonist detection of many synthetic and endogenous neuromodulators across the whole brain.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe interleukin-1 (IL-1) family and the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome contribute to atherogenesis but the underlying mechanism are incompletely understood. Unlike IL-1{beta}, IL-1 is not dependent on the NLRP3 inflammasome to exert its pro-inflammatory effects. Here, a non-genetic model was applied to characterize the role of IL-1, IL-1{beta} and NLRP3 for the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.\n\nMethodsAtherogenesis was induced by gain-of-function PCSK9-AAV8 mutant viruses and feeding of a high-fat western diet (WTD) for 12 weeks in C57Bl6/J wildtype mice (control) and in Il1a-/-, Nlrp3-/-, and Il1b-/- mice.\n\nResultsIl1a-/- mice showed reduced atherosclerotic plaque area in the aortic root with lower lipid accumulation, while no difference was observed between wildtype, Nlrp3-/- and Il1b-/- mice. Serum proteomic analysis showed a reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1{beta}, IL-6) in Il1a-/- as well as in Nlrp3-/- and Il1b-/- mice. Bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDC) of WT, Nlrp3-/- and Il1b-/- mice and primary human monocytes showed translocation of IL-1 to the plasma membrane (csIL-1) upon stimulation with LPS. The translocation of IL-1 to the cell surface was regulated by myristoylation and increased in mice with hypercholesterolemia. CsIL-1 and IL1R1 protein-protein interaction on endothelial cells induced VCAM1 expression and monocyte adhesion, which was abrogated by the administration of neutralizing antibodies against IL-1 and IL1R1.\n\nConclusionsIl1a-/- mice, but not Nlrp3-/- or Il1b-/- mice, are protected from atherosclerosis after induction of hypercholesterolemia independent of circulating cytokines. Myristoylation and translocation of IL-1 to the cell surface in myeloid cells facilitates leukocyte adhesion and contributes to the development of atherosclerosis.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=114 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/543077v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c54814org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ff1971org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@df5605org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@889a1a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphical abstract.C_FLOATNO The role of cell-surface (cs) IL-1a in the initiation of atherosclerosis.\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Human pregnancy is frequently accompanied by nausea and vomiting that may become severe and life-threatening, as in hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), the cause of which is unknown. Growth Differentiation Factor-15 (GDF15), a hormone known to act on the hindbrain to cause emesis, is highly expressed in the placenta and its levels in maternal blood rise rapidly in pregnancy. Variants in the maternal GDF15 gene are associated with HG. Here we report that fetal production of GDF15, and maternal sensitivity to it, both contribute substantially to the risk of HG. We found that the great majority of GDF15 in maternal circulation is derived from the feto-placental unit and that higher GDF15 levels in maternal blood are associated with vomiting and are further elevated in patients with HG. Conversely, we found that lower levels of GDF15 in the non-pregnant state predispose women to HG. A rare C211G variant in GDF15 which strongly predisposes mothers to HG, particularly when the fetus is wild-type, was found to markedly impair cellular secretion of GDF15 and associate with low circulating levels of GDF15 in the non-pregnant state. Consistent with this, two common GDF15 haplotypes which predispose to HG were associated with lower circulating levels outside pregnancy. The administration of a long-acting form of GDF15 to wild-type mice markedly reduced subsequent responses to an acute dose, establishing that desensitisation is a feature of this system. GDF15 levels are known to be highly and chronically elevated in patients with beta thalassemia. In women with this disorder, reports of symptoms of nausea or vomiting in pregnancy were strikingly diminished. Our findings support a causal role for fetal derived GDF15 in the nausea and vomiting of human pregnancy, with maternal sensitivity, at least partly determined by pre-pregnancy exposure to GDF15, being a major influence on its severity. They also suggest mechanism-based approaches to the treatment and prevention of HG.",

    "abstract": "Enteric neurons, diverse in function and great in number, are heavily involved in homeostasis within the small intestine and their dysregulation has been implicated in gastrointestinal disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Innovations in biofabrication have resulted in advances for in vitro models of the gut, however the majority lack enteric innervation, limiting therapeutic screening and discovery. Here, we present a high-throughput co-cultured microphysiological system (MPS), or organ chip, that supports a primary epithelial monolayer that directly interfaces with a three-dimensional hydrogel containing a primary enteric neuron culture, mimicking the close proximity present in vivo. The acrylic MPS device was fabricated with our established and cost-effective laser cut and assemble method. We have expanded this technology to include up to twelve 3D MPSs per device within the footprint of a traditional well-plate, supporting high-throughput experimentation. The inclusion of this 3D microtissue does not hinder physiologically relevant flow, standard measures of barrier function, and microscopy techniques. The device features gravity-driven flow to induce physiological shear stress on the epithelium culture and provide continuous nutrient presentation. Results show the intestinal and neural tissue maintained expected morphologies over an experimental timeline of ten days. Proximal enteric neurons extend neurites through the 3D hydrogel towards the epithelial monolayer. Barrier function was confirmed with both Transepithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) and Lucifer Yellow diffusion on-chip. TEER confirmed a significantly more substantial barrier integrity in co-cultures compared to baseline values (1.25-fold) in epithelial cell-only. Lucifer yellow permeability assays performed in parallel supported the TEER results, with an 11.8% lower permeability of the co-cultured group than the epithelium only. The presence of the ENS on chip results in a significant (1.4 fold) reduction in epidermal growth factor (EGF). This is the first high-throughput, innervated gut on a chip device that demonstrates the importance of the autonomic nervous system on EGF expression and possibly epithelial renewal in vitro. Innervation is essential to create more biomimetic and physiologically relevant in vitro models for biological and pharmacological assays.",

    "abstract": "Solvatochromic compounds have emerged as valuable environment-sensitive probes for biological research, with the chromophore of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) being a well-studied example. In this study, we demonstrate that synthetic analogues of the GFP chromophore can be used to investigate ligand-induced conformational changes in proteins. We synthesized thiol-reactive derivatives of four analogues of the GFP chromophore that exhibit notable solvatochromism. We used these derivatives to label two proteins: the soluble calcium sensor recoverin (Rec) and the transmembrane G protein-coupled A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR), via cysteines located or introduced in the regions that undergo structural changes upon ligand binding. Two of these dyes showed Ca2+-induced fluorescence changes when attached to Rec. Notably, our best-performing dye, DyeC, when attached to A2AAR, revealed agonist-induced changes in both fluorescence intensity and shape of the emission spectrum. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provided mechanistic insights into these changes showing the activation of A2AAR transfers DyeC to a more confined and more hydrophilic environment. Additionally, an allosteric modulator, HMA, induces changes in DyeC fluorescence spectra, indicating a distinct receptor conformation from apo, antagonist, or agonist-bound receptors. Our study demonstrates that GFP-inspired dyes are effective for detecting structural changes in GPCR (G protein-coupled receptors), with advantages such as the ability to perform both intensity-based and ratiometric tracking, red-shifted fluorescence spectra, high extinction coefficient, and sensitivity to allosteric modulation. These dyes expand the toolbox for tracking ligand-induced changes and facilitate new insights into conformational changes induced by allosteric modulators in GPCRs.",

    "abstract": "The coiled coil protein crescentin is required for the crescent shape of the freshwater bacterium Caulobacter crescentus (vibrioides). Crescentin forms a filamentous structure on the inner, concave side of the curved cells. It shares features with eukaryotic intermediate filament (IF) proteins, such as its ability to form filaments in vitro, the proteins length, sequence comparisons and the presence of a coiled coil discontinuity called the \"stutter\". Here, we have used electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structure of the full-length protein and its filament, exploiting a crescentin-specific nanobody. The filament is formed by two strands, related by two-fold symmetry that each consist of two dimers, resulting in an octameric assembly. Crescentin subunits form longitudinal contacts head-to-head and tail-to-tail, making the entire filament non-polar. Using in vivo site-directed cysteine crosslinking we demonstrated that contacts observed in the in vitro filament structure exist in cells. Electron cryotomography (cryo-ET) of cells expressing crescentin showed filaments on the concave side of the curved cells, close to the inner membrane, where they form a band. Comparison of our crescentin filament structure with current models of IF proteins and their filaments revealed similar coiled coil dimer formation as well as an absence of overall polarity. IF proteins form head-to-tail longitudinal contacts in contrast to crescentin and hence several inter-dimer contacts in IFs have no equivalents in crescentin filaments. Our work supports the idea that intermediate filament-like proteins achieve their shared polymerization and mechanical properties through a variety of filament architectures.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTCrescentin is a coiled coil protein that is required for the crescent cell shape of bacteria such as Caulobacter crescentus. Crescentin shares biochemical and cytoskeletal properties with intermediate filament (IF) proteins, which form the third major class of cytoskeletal proteins in eukaryotes. To better understand the relationship between crescentin and IF proteins, and the filaments they form, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of crescentin filaments by cryo-EM. This revealed the full-length structure of the parallel coiled coil dimer of crescentin and how dimers come together laterally and longitudinally, to form a non-polar, octameric filament. Differences in filament architecture highlight the versatility of intermediate filament-like proteins across the tree of life.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria play a central role in muscle metabolism and function. In skeletal muscles, a unique family of iron-sulfur proteins, termed CISD proteins, support mitochondrial function. The abundance of these proteins declines with aging leading to muscle degeneration. Although the function of the outer mitochondrial proteins CISD1 and CISD2 has been defined, the role of the inner mitochondrial protein CISD3, is currently unknown. Here we show that CISD3 deficiency in mice results in muscle atrophy that shares proteomic features with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. We further reveal that CISD3 deficiency impairs the function and structure of skeletal muscle mitochondria, and that CISD3 interacts with, and donates its clusters to, Complex I respiratory chain subunit NDUFV2. These findings reveal that CISD3 is important for supporting the biogenesis and function of Complex I, essential for muscle maintenance and function. Interventions that target CISD3 could therefore impact muscle degeneration syndromes, aging, and related conditions.",

While specific membraneless organelles are found in stereotypical locations, little is known about the physical mechanisms that guide their positioning. Here, we investigate how stress granules, a type of cytoplasmic membraneless organelle, establish their stereotypical perinuclear positioning. We find that actin and microtubules play complementary roles. Lamellar actin confines stress granules, and its retrograde flow drives them toward the cell center. Microtubules, in turn, adhere to stress granules through capillary interactions, which tend to concentrate stress granules in micro-tubule rich regions near the nucleus. Similar physical mechanisms are likely to play a role in the positioning of other membraneless organelles.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant glycosylation is a hallmark of a cancer cell. One prevalent alteration is an enrichment in 2,6-linked sialylation of N-glycosylated proteins, a modification directed by the ST6GAL1 sialyltransferase. ST6GAL1 is upregulated in many malignancies including ovarian cancer. Prior studies have shown that the addition of 2,6 sialic acid to the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) activates this receptor, although the mechanism was largely unknown. To investigate the role of ST6GAL1 in EGFR activation, ST6GAL1 was overexpressed in the OV4 ovarian cancer line, which lacks endogenous ST6GAL1, or knocked down in the OVCAR-3 and OVCAR-5 ovarian cancer lines, which have robust ST6GAL1 expression. Cells with high expression of ST6GAL1 displayed increased activation of EGFR and its downstream signaling targets, AKT and NF{kappa}B. Using biochemical and microscopy approaches, including Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we determined that the 2,6 sialylation of EGFR promoted its dimerization and higher order oligomerization. Additionally, ST6GAL1 activity was found to modulate EGFR trafficking dynamics following EGF-induced receptor activation. Specifically, EGFR sialylation enhanced receptor recycling to the cell surface following activation while simultaneously inhibiting lysosomal degradation. 3D widefield deconvolution microscopy confirmed that in cells with high ST6GAL1 expression, EGFR exhibited greater co-localization with Rab11 recycling endosomes and reduced co-localization with LAMP1-positive lysosomes. Collectively, our findings highlight a novel mechanism by which 2,6 sialylation promotes EGFR signaling by facilitating receptor oligomerization and recycling.",

    "abstract": "Establishment of the vertebrate body plan requires a combination of extra-embryonic signalling to establish morphogen gradients, and an underlying self-assembly mechanism that contributes to pattern regulation and robustness. Gastruloids are aggregates of mouse embryonic stem cells that break morphological symmetry and polarise Brachyury (Bra) expression in the absence of extra-embryonic signals. However, the mechanism by which symmetry breaking occurs is not yet known. During gastrulation and body axis elongation, retinoic acid (RA) and Cyp26a1 are polarised along the anteroposterior axis, and this is critical for balancing the decision of cells to self-renew or differentiate. We found that symmetry-breaking in gastruloids is coincident with the separation of Aldh1a2 and Cyp26a1 expression, and that feedback from Bra is critical for maintaining polarised Cyp26a1 gene expression in the gastruloid posterior region. Furthermore, we reveal a short temporal window where RA signalling can negatively influence both Bra and Cyp26a1 expression. These observations lead us to suggest a mechanism of how initial gastruloid patterning, subsequent elongation, and evolving network topologies can create defined boundaries of RA signalling that permits proper axial patterning and gastruloid growth.",

    "abstract": "Microscopy has rapidly evolved at pace with live markers, enabling ever higher spatiotemporal resolution of multicellular dynamics within larger fields of view. Consequently, we are now in the era of widespread production of terabyte (TB)-sized time-lapse movies of experimental model systems, including developing embryos and organoids. Working with these large datasets has presented a new set of hurdles, particularly due to the lack of standardized open-source pipelines for acquiring, handling and analyzing the data. Moreover, although long-term tracking of a cell throughout an entire process, for example vertebrate organogenesis, is key to revealing the underlying cellular dynamics, this has proven largely elusive. To specifically address the question \"But, what are the cells doing?\", we created an image analysis pipeline optimized to track single cells in light-sheet acquired datasets (1 TB sized time-lapse, 8h of imaging, 30 min gene expression cycle, cell movement speed (1{micro}m /1 minute), 200-400 {micro}m tissue depth). Our modular pipeline optimizes and connects the following: image acquisition parameters to improve tracking feasibility; hardware specifications; data handling and compression tools; pre-processing steps; state-of-the-art cell tracking tools (Mastodon, MaMuT) and a novel open-source/ python-based tool (Paleontologist) to analyze and visualize spatiotemporal dynamics of the tracked cells. Importantly, our pipeline is adaptable to a variety of experimental systems and accessible to researchers regardless of expertise in coding and image analysis.\n\nOne-sentence SummaryUser-friendly cell-tracking pipeline that connects image acquisition in multicellular systems through to data analysis of cellular dynamics.",

    "abstract": "RNA plays critical roles in the transmission and regulation of genetic information and is increasingly used in biomedical and biotechnological applications. Functional RNAs contain extended double-stranded regions and the structure of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) has been revealed at high-resolution. However, the dependence of the properties of the RNA double helix on environmental effects, notably temperature, is still poorly understood. Here, we use single-molecule magnetic tweezers measurements to determine the dependence of the dsRNA twist on temperature. We find that dsRNA unwinds with increasing temperature, even more than DNA, with {Delta}TwRNA = -14.4 {+/-} 0.7 {o}/({degrees}C{middle dot}kbp), compared to {Delta}TwDNA = -11.0 {+/-} 1.2 {o}/({degrees}C{middle dot}kbp). All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a range of nucleic acid force fields, ion parameters, and water models correctly predict that dsRNA unwinds with rising temperature, but significantly underestimate the magnitude of the effect. These MD data, together with additional MD simulations involving DNA and DNA-RNA hybrid duplexes, reveal a linear correlation between twist temperature decrease and the helical rise, in line with DNA but at variance with RNA experimental data. We speculate that this discrepancy might be caused by some unknown bias in the RNA force fields tested, or by as yet undiscovered transient alternative structures in the RNA duplex. Our results provide a baseline to model more complex RNA assemblies and to test and develop new parameterizations for RNA simulations. They may also inspire physical models of temperature-dependent dsRNA structure.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRepeated sub-concussive head impacts are a growing brain health concern, but the possible mechanisms of trauma and plausible biomarkers remain elusive. One impediment is the lack of an experimental model to study the effects of sub-concussive head impacts on the brain.\n\nObjectivesThis works objective was to provide an experimental model to study the acute effects of sub-concussive head impacts on the brain. To do so, this study aimed to replicate previous work from Di Virgilio et al. (2016) showing that head impacts from heading footballs acutely alter brain excitability by increasing corticomotor inhibition.\n\nMethodsScores from the Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire and measurements of cortical silent period (CSP) duration - obtained using transcranial magnetic stimulation to assess corticomotor inhibition in the central nervous system - were taken before and after participants performed 20 football headings (Headings; n = 30) or control (Control; n = 30).\n\nResultsThe results revealed increased headaches and dizziness symptoms in the Headings as compared to the Control group, revealing the qualitative experience of head impacts. The results then revealed that CSP duration similarly lengthened in both the Headings and Control groups, suggesting that head impacts did not cause the increased corticomotor inhibition.\n\nConclusionsThe results show that head impacts from football headings did not acutely alter corticomotor inhibition as compared to a control group that did not experience head impacts, suggesting that excitability changes do not reflect acute sub-concussive brain injuries. Nonetheless, this work suggests that football headings can be used as an experimental model to study the effects of sub-concussive head impacts on brain health. Future work could use the present procedures to investigate additional biomarkers of brain injury.",

The recently proposed direct imaging of neuronal activity (DIANA) using ultrahigh-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown promise, but the translation from anesthetized mice to awake humans poses a significant challenge. Here we present Time Resolved ImaGing of Global Electroneurophysiological Record (TRIGGER), a novel technique that enables the direct detection of neural activity in the awake human brain using 3T MRI. In 18 participants, visual responses were captured at 5-mm spatial resolution and 1.4-ms temporal resolution. Importantly, the delay in stimulus presentation reliably corresponded to the latency of neural responses on a millisecond scale. Furthermore, when stimuli were presented to one visual field, the responses in two hemispheres exhibited the expected time difference. This non-invasive mapping approach holds the potential to elucidate neural dynamics underlying human brain function and disorders.",

    "abstract": "We used common garden growth experiments to study genetic variation among geographic isolates (Greenland, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, USA) of the filamentous brown seaweed Pilayella littoralis, including the free-living form unique to Nahant Bay, Massachusetts. Ecotypic variation for temperature growth maximum was demonstrated for a west Greenland isolate (10{degrees} C versus 15{degrees} C for other attached isolates) and between Nahant Bay attached (narrower phenotypic plasticity) and free-living forms (broader phenotypic plasticity) of the species. Morphological and reproductive characteristics of attached and free-living isolates remained distinctive under identical culture conditions after four years. The attached forms were characteristically cabled, twisted, and clumped; unilocular reproductive cells were common and plurilocular reproductive cells were present. The free-living form was characteristically loosely branched and ball-like; only vegetative reproduction occurred, with a few unilocular reproductive cells observed in one experiment. Free-living and attached isolates cultured using no water movement and turbulent conditions to mimic surf and surge conditions did not develop forms that resembled each other after eight months. We additionally used starch gel electrophoresis to study genetic variability in attached and free-living forms of P. littoralis from Nahant Bay. Free-living and attached populations were not different at the isozyme level because a limited number of isozymes were resolved (six out of 39 enzymes tested). One isozyme (PGI) was polymorphic, with two alleles present. The two alleles shared in the attached and free-living populations suggest that the free-living form is not one large identical clone. For attached and free-living P. littoralis, both transplant and growth studies in the laboratory provide convincing evidence of ecotypic differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Plant phenology is a crucial component of ecosystem functioning and is affected by multiple elements of global change; we therefore need to quantify the current phenological changes associated to human activities and understand their impacts on ecosystems. Urbanisation and the intensification of anthropogenic activities alter meteorological conditions and cause phenological changes in urban vegetation worldwide. We used remote sensing data to evaluate the phenological response (start of season date SOS, length of season LOS and end of season date EOS) to urbanisation in the 69 most populated pan-European metropolitan areas (i.e., those that include cities with a population over 450,000 inhabitants) for the period 2002-2021, taking into account the main vegetation types (evergreen forests, deciduous forests, mixed forests, sparse woody vegetation and grasslands). While our findings support previously reported general phenological patterns in response to urbanisation, we found that macrobioclimatic factors strongly determined the strength and direction of the phenological response to urbanisation intensity. In general, SOS advanced and LOS increased with urbanisation intensity across Europe. However, the greatest advances in SOS were registered in metropolitan areas in the Mediterranean region, where there was also more uncertainty in the relationship between SOS and urbanisation. The EOS advanced with urbanisation in metropolitan areas in the Mediterranean macrobioclimate (except for deciduous forests), whereas the opposite trend was observed in metropolitan areas from the Temperate macrobioclimate. Our results suggest that macrobioclimatic constraints operating at the continental scale mediate the relationship between urbanisation intensity and plant phenology.",

In this work, we study the coarsening kinetics of phase-separating lipid membranes subjected to nonequilibrium forces and flows transmitted by motor-driven gliding actin filaments. We experimentally observe that the activity-induced surface flows trigger rapid coarsening of non-circular membrane domains that grow as [~]t2/3, a 2x acceleration in the growth exponent compared to passive coalescence and Ostwald ripening. We analyze these results by developing analytical theories based on the Smoluchowski coagulation model and the phase field model to predict the domain growth in the presence of active flows.

    "abstract": "IntroductionLysine succinylation is a post-translational modification associated with the control of several diseases, including acute kidney injury (AKI). It is suggested that hypersuccinylation favors peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation (FAO) instead of mitochondrial. In addition, the medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) dodecanedioic acid (DC12) and octanedioic acid (DC8), upon FAO, generate succinyl-CoA, resulting in hypersuccinylation. DC8 is convenient, inexpensive, easily administered, and efficient. We believe this study could be translated in the future to clinical settings, which would highly benefit patients at high risk of AKI.\n\nMethods and ResultsTo test the protective roles of MCFAs during AKI, mice were fed with control, 10% DC12, or 10% DC8 diet, then, subjected to either ischemic-AKI, or cisplatin-AKI models. Supplementation was provided until sacrifice. Biochemical, histologic, genetic, and proteomic analysis were performed, the latter involving a lysine-succinylome-based analysis. Both DC8 and DC12 prevented the rise of AKI markers in mice that underwent renal injury. However, DC8 was even more protective against AKI than DC12. Finally, succinylome analysis evidenced that the kidneys of DC8-fed mice showed an extensive succinylation of peroxisomal activity-related proteins, and a decline in mitochondrial FAO, in comparison to control-fed mice.\n\nConclusionDC8 supplementation drives renal protein hypersuccinylation, promoting a shift from mitochondrial to peroxisomal FAO, and protecting against AKI.\n\nSignificance StatementLysine succinylation of proteins is shown to control several diseases, including acute kidney injury (AKI). Here we show that mice supplemented with the medium-chain fatty acid octanedioic acid successfully presented a high level of succinylation and were protected from both ischemia-reperfusion- and cisplatin-induced AKI. Moreover, our study demonstrates that peroxisomal activity was increased while mitochondrial activity was preserved, suggesting that the metabolism of diet-obtained medium-chain fatty acids by peroxisomes is renoprotective.",

By extension, their ability to tolerate thermal extremes is directly linked to their thermal niche and distribution. Understanding the physiological mechanisms that limit insect thermal tolerance is therefore crucial for our ability to predict biogeography and range shifts. Recent studies on fruit flies and locusts suggest that the loss of coordinated movements at the critical thermal minimum is due to a loss of central nervous system function via a spreading depolarization. We hypothesized that a similar mechanism limits nervous function in other insect taxa. Here, we use electrophysiology to investigate whether the same spreading depolarization event occurs in the brain of butterflies exposed to stressful cold. Supporting our hypothesis, we find that exposure to stressful cold induced spreading depolarization in all species tested. This reinforces the idea that loss of central nervous function by a spreading depolarization is a common mechanism underlying the critical thermal minimum in insects. Furthermore, our results highlight how central nervous system performance is finely tuned to match species environments. Further research into the physiological mechanisms underlying the spreading depolarization event is likely to elucidate key mechanisms determining insect ecology.",

    "abstract": "A core necessity to behavioral neuroscience research is the ability to accurately measure performance on behavioral assays, such as the novel object location and novel object recognition tasks. These tasks are widely used in neuroscience research and measure a rodents instinct for investigating novel features as a proxy to test their memory of a previous experience. Automated tools for scoring behavioral videos can be cost prohibitive and often have difficulty distinguishing between active investigation of an object and simply being in close proximity to an object. As such, many experimenters continue to rely on hand scoring interactions using stopwatches which makes it difficult to review scoring after-the-fact and results in the loss of temporal information. Here, we introduce Chronotate, a free, open-source tool to aid in manually scoring novel object behavior videos. The software consists of an interactive video player with keyboard integration for marking timestamps of behavioral events during video playback, making it simple to quickly score and review bouts of rodent-object interaction. In addition, Chronotate outputs detailed interaction bout data, allowing for nuanced behavioral performance analyses. Using this detailed temporal information, we demonstrate that novel object location performance peaks within the first 3 seconds of interaction time and preference for the novel location becomes reduced across the test session. Thus, Chronotate can be used to determine the temporal structure of interactions on this task and can provide new insight into the memory processes that drive this behavior.

    "abstract": "Quagga mussels have expanded their range across the northern hemisphere in recent decades owing to their dispersal abilities, prolific reproduction rates, and broad ecological tolerances. Their remarkable capacity to filter particulates from the water column has had profound effects on inland aquatic ecosystems. In the North American Great Lakes, quagga mussel populations have increased inexorably since the late 1980s, but it remains unclear whether quagga mussels will follow a similar trajectory in Europe where they have appeared more recently. Here we apply knowledge from a 33-year quagga population monitoring effort in the North American lakes to predict future quagga populations in deep European lakes, where quaggas are quickly becoming a conspicuous part of the underwater landscape. We predict that quagga mussel biomass in Lakes Biel, Constance, and Geneva may increase by a factor of 9 - 20 by 2045. Like in North America, this increase may be characterized by a shift to larger individuals and deeper depths as the population matures. If realized, this rapid expansion of quagga mussels would likely drive the largest aquatic ecosystem change in deep European lakes since the eutrophication period of the mid-20th century.",

    "abstract": "During development of multicellular organisms, cells must execute precise molecular decisions to achieve cell fate specification and differentiation. These decisions are orchestrated by networks of transcription factors (TFs) which act to regulate gene expression of specific cohorts of genes to ultimately confer identity. Depending on the cellular context, TF expression can vary dramatically both spatially and temporally. These differences in expression patterns can result in tissue-specific differences in TF binding to downstream targets. To identify targets on a tissue-specific basis, Targeted DamID (TaDa) has been recently introduced to generate TF binding profiles in various models including C. elegans. However, TaDa suffers from portability such that a new promoter-TF fusion transgene must be constructed for every new experimental condition of interest. Here, we adapt NanoDam for usage in C. elegans, which relies on endogenous TF-GFP knock-ins, a plethora of which have already been generated by the community. We report that NanoDam single copy transgenes consisting of lowly expressed, tissue-specific GFP nanobody-Dam fusions, when combined with endogenous GFP-tagged alleles of TFs, results in robust, tissue-specific profiling. Using an endogenous GFP-tagged allele of EGL-43/EVI1, we performed NanoDam profiling of two disparate tissue types, the anchor cell (AC) and dopaminergic neurons, and identify targets unique to each and shared by both cell types. We also identify two GATA TFs, ELT-6 and EGL-18, as novel regulators of AC invasion. Together, we demonstrate that NanoDam is capable of profiling endogenous GFP-tagged TFs to identify novel downstream targets in specific cell types of C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "Targeting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to combat cancer is increasingly being investigated using a variety of small molecule inhibitors. Clinical success for these inhibitors has been hampered due to serious side-effects potentially arising from the inability to discriminate between non-cancerous and cancerous mitochondria. Although mitochondrial oxidative metabolism is essential for malignant growth, mitochondria OXPHOS is also essential to the physiology of all organs, including high-energy-demand organs like the heart. In comparing tumor OXPHOS reliance to these preeminent oxidative organs it is unclear if a therapeutic window for targeting mitochondrial OXPHOS in cancer exists. To address this gap in knowledge, mitochondrial OXPHOS was comprehensively evaluated across various murine tumors and compared to both matched normal tissues and other organs. When compared to both matched normal tissues, as well as high OXPHOS reliant organs like heart, intrinsic expression of the OXPHOS complexes, as well as OXPHOS flux were consistently lower across distinct tumor types. Operating on the assumption that intrinsic OXPHOS expression/function predicts OXPHOS reliance in vivo, these data suggest that pharmacologic blockade of mitochondrial OXPHOS likely compromises bioenergetic homeostasis in healthy oxidative organs prior to impacting tumor mitochondrial flux in a clinically meaningful way. Although these data caution against the use of indiscriminate mitochondrial inhibitors for cancer treatment, considerable heterogeneity was observed across tumor types with respect to both mitochondrial proteome composition and substrate-specific flux, highlighting the possibility for targeting discrete mitochondrial proteins or pathways unique to a given tumor type.",

    "abstract": "Intracortical microelectrodes that can record and stimulate brain activity have become a valuable technique for basic science research and clinical applications. However, long-term implantation of these microelectrodes can lead to progressive neurodegeneration in the surrounding microenvironment, characterized by elevation in disease-associated markers. Dysregulation of autophagy-lysosomal degradation, a major intracellular waste removal process, is considered a key factor in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. It is plausible that similar dysfunctions in autophagy-lysosomal degradation contribute to tissue degeneration following implantation-induced focal brain injury, ultimately impacting recording performance. To understand how the focal, persistent brain injury caused by long-term microelectrode implantation impairs the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, we employed two-photon microscopy and immunohistology. This investigation focused on the spatiotemporal characterization of autophagy-lysosomal activity near the chronically implanted microelectrode. We observed an aberrant accumulation of immature autophagy vesicles near the microelectrode over the chronic implantation period. Additionally, we found deficits in autophagy-lysosomal clearance proximal to the chronic implant, which was associated with an accumulation of autophagy cargo and a reduction in lysosomal protease level during the chronic period. Furthermore, our evidence suggests astrocytes contribute to the clearance of myelin debris via autophagy-lysosomal degradation near the implanted microelectrode. Together, this study sheds light on the process of brain tissue degeneration caused by long-term microelectrode implantation, with a specific focus on impaired intracellular waste degradation.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are joint diseases that are associated with pain and lost quality of life. No disease modifying OA drugs are currently available. RA treatments are better established but are not always effective and can cause immune suppression. Here, an MMP13-selective siRNA conjugate was developed that, when delivered intravenously, docks onto endogenous albumin and promotes preferential accumulation in articular cartilage and synovia of OA and RA joints. MMP13 expression was diminished upon intravenous delivery of MMP13 siRNA conjugates, consequently decreasing multiple histological and molecular markers of disease severity, while also reducing clinical manifestations such as swelling (RA) and joint pressure sensitivity (RA and OA). Importantly, MMP13 silencing provided more comprehensive OA treatment efficacy than standard of care (steroids) or experimental MMP inhibitors. These data demonstrate the utility of albumin  hitchhiking for drug delivery to arthritic joints, and establish the therapeutic utility of systemically delivered anti-MMP13 siRNA conjugates in OA and RA.\n\nEditorial SummaryLipophilic siRNA conjugates optimized for albumin binding and \"hitchhiking\" can be leveraged to achieve preferential delivery to and gene silencing activity within arthritic joints. Chemical stabilization of the lipophilic siRNA enables intravenous siRNA delivery without lipid or polymer encapsulation. Using siRNA sequences targeting MMP13, a key driver of arthritis-related inflammation, albumin hitchhiking siRNA diminished MMP13, inflammation, and manifestations of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis at molecular, histological, and clinical levels, consistently outperforming clinical standards of care and small molecule MMP antagonists.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLesion scores on procurement donor biopsies are commonly used to guide organ utilization. However, frozen sections present challenges for histological scoring, leading to inter- and intra-observer variability and inappropriate discard.\n\nMethodsWe constructed deep-learning based models to recognize kidney tissue compartments in H&E stained sections from procurement biopsies performed at 583 hospitals nationwide in year 2011-2020. The models were trained and tested respectively on 11473 and 3986 images sliced from 100 slides. We then extracted whole-slide abnormality features from 2431 kidneys, and correlated with pathologists scores and transplant outcomes. Finally, a Kidney Donor Quality Score (KDQS) incorporating digital features and the Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) was derived and used in combination with recipient demographic and peri-transplant characteristics to predict graft loss or assist organ utilization.\n\nResultsOur model accurately identified 96% and 91% of normal/sclerotic glomeruli respectively; 94% of arteries/arterial intimal fibrosis regions; 90% of tubules. Three whole-slide features (Sclerotic Glomeruli%, Arterial Intimal Fibrosis%, and Interstitial Fibrosis%) demonstrated strong correlations with corresponding pathologists scores (n=2431), but had superior associations with post-transplant eGFR (n=2033) and graft loss (n=1560). The combination of KDQS and other factors predicted 1- and 4-year graft loss (discovery: n=520, validation: n=1040). Finally, by matching 398 discarded kidneys due to \"biopsy findings\" to transplanted population, the matched transplants from discarded KDQS<4 group (110/398, 27.6%) showed similar graft survival rate to unmatched transplanted kidneys (2-, 5-year survival rate: 97%, 86%). KDQS [&ge;] 7 (37/398, 9.3%) and 1-year survival model score [&ge;] 0.55 were determined to identify possible discards (PPV=0.92).\n\nConclusionThis deep-learning based approach provides automatic and reliable pathological assessment of procurement kidney biopsies, which could facilitate graft loss risk stratification and organ utilization.\n\nTranslational StatementThis deep-learning based approach provides rapid but more objective, sensitive and reliable assessment of deceased-donor kidneys before transplantation, and improves the prognostic value of procurement biopsies, thus could potentially reduce inappropriate discard and stratify patients needing monitoring or preventative measures after transplantation. The pipeline can be integrated into various types of scanners and conveniently generates report after slide scanning. Such report can be used in conjunction with pathologists report or independently for centers lacking renal pathologists.",

    "abstract": "Physiological time is important for understanding the development and seasonal timing of ectothermic animals, but has largely been applied to developmental processes that occur during spring and summer such as morphogenesis. There is a substantial knowledge gap in the relationship between temperature and development during winter, a season that is increasingly impacted by climate change. Most temperate insects overwinter in diapause, a developmental process with little obvious morphological change. We used principles from the physiological time literature to measure and model the thermal sensitivity of diapause development rate in the apple maggot fly Rhagoletis pomonella, a univoltine fly whose diapause duration varies substantially within and among populations. We showed that diapause duration could be modelled with simple linear relationships between diapause development rate and temperature. Low temperatures were necessary for most individuals to complete diapause, similar to many insects. However, we also found evidence for an ontogenetic shift in the thermal sensitivity of diapause: diapause development proceeded more quickly at high temperatures later in diapause and in the absence of quiescence, a phenomenon not previously reported. Increasingly warmer temperatures during and after winter may impact the phenology of this and other insects with temperature-sensitive diapause, impacting their viability.",

    "abstract": "Organisms experience constant nutritional flux, and homeostatic mechanisms evolved to operate at the nexus of extreme nutritional states - scarcity and surplus. Thus, we surmised that decoding bidirectional molecular switches that operate at the interface of scarcity response and surplus signaling will enable the development of strategies to treat disorders that arise from nutrient imbalance states. Adipocytes secrete leptin, an interleukin protein, which signals nutrient surplus to the central brain to regulate feeding and energy expenditure. We report that Atg8-LC3-family proteins, best known for their role in autophagy, are required for leptin secretion in Drosophila and human adipocytes. Atg8-LC3 genetic knockdown and point mutations to the Atg8-LC3 interaction motif (AIM/LIR) of leptin, and its functional ortholog in Drosophila, Upd2, disrupt adipokine secretion and increase adipokine retention in human and fly cells. At an organismal level, Atg8-driven Upd2 retention increases organismal resilience to nutrient extremes by rewiring the transcriptome, organismal feeding behavior, and hunger response. Comparative proteomic analyses reveal that LC3 directs leptin to an exosome secretory pathway. We use genetic knockdown in primary human adipocytes to establish that LC3 is required for leptin secretion in a physiologically relevant mammalian system. Hence, we uncover a previously unknown and evolutionarily conserved role for Atg8-LC3 in promoting adipocyte-brain nutrient surplus signaling. We propose that Atg8-LC3s bidirectional role in nutrient sensing-conveying nutrient surplus and responding to nutrient deprivation-enables organisms to manage nutrient flux effectively.",

    "abstract": "Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist that has both antidepressant and anesthetic properties. At subanesthetic doses, ketamine can cause transient psychosis in humans, and is used to model psychosis in experimental animals. In rodents, subanesthetic doses of ketamine increase the power of high-frequency oscillations (HFO, 100-180 Hz) in the electroencephalogram and field potentials, a frequency band linked to cognitive functions. However, the effects of ketamine in higher mammals, with more translatable relevance, are poorly investigated. Here, we have examined cortical HFO during wakefulness, sleep, and after administering a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine (15 mg/kg), utilizing the cat as an animal model. Four cats were implanted with cortical electrodes for chronic polysomnographic recordings. HFO power, connectivity, information flow directionality, and their relationships with respiratory activity were analyzed. During wakefulness, but not during sleep, we found that HFO were coupled with the inspiratory phase of the respiration. After ketamine administration, HFO were enhanced significantly and remained associated with the inspiratory phase. The analysis of the information flow after ketamine suggest that HFO originate from the olfactory bulb and stream towards the prefrontal cortex. Accordingly, occluding the nostrils significantly reduced HFO power in both the olfactory bulb and prefrontal cortex. In contrast, auditory stimulation did not affect HFO. In conclusion, spontaneous cortical HFO show certain state-dependent features in cats, and enhancement of this rhythm by ketamine may disrupt cortical information processing, which could contribute to some of the neuropsychiatric manifestations associated with ketamine.\n\nHighlightsO_LIKetamine is used to model psychosis in humans and experimental animals\nC_LIO_LISubanesthetic doses of ketamine increase the power of high-frequency oscillations\nC_LIO_LIHigh-frequency oscillations are coupled with the inspiratory phase of respiration\nC_LIO_LIThese oscillations originate in the olfactory bulb and stream to the neocortex\nC_LIO_LINostril occlusion lowers high-frequency activity in the olfactory bulb and neocortex\nC_LI\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=69 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/543142v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e386feorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b3c06aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d93ecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1daa161_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We define cell type-specific genes and pathways that VSG rescues from high-fat diet perturbation and characterize additional rescue-independent changes brought about by VSG. We show that Paneth cells have increased expression of the gut peptide Reg3g after VSG. We also find that VSG restores pathways pertaining to mitochondrial respiration and cellular metabolism, especially within crypt-based cells.

    "abstract": "The Bile Acid Sodium Symporter (BASS) family transports a wide array of molecules across membranes, including bile acids in humans, and small metabolites in plants. These transporters, many of which are sodium-coupled, have been shown to use an elevator mechanism of transport, but exactly how substrate binding is coupled to sodium ion binding and transport is not clear. Here we solve the crystal structure at 2.3 [A] of a transporter from Neisseria Meningitidis (ASBTNM) in complex with pantoate, a potential substrate of ASBTNM. The BASS family is characterised by two helices that cross-over in the centre of the protein in an arrangement that is intricately held together by two sodium ions. We observe that the pantoate binds, specifically, between the N-termini of two of the opposing helices in this cross-over region. During molecular dynamics simulations the pantoate remains in this position when sodium ions are present but is more mobile in their absence. Comparison of structures in the presence and absence of pantoate demonstrates that pantoate elicits a conformational change in one of the cross-over helices. This modifies the interface between the two domains that move relative to one another to elicit the elevator mechanism. These results have implications, not only for ASBTNM but for the BASS family as a whole and indeed other transporters that work through the elevator mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) in conjunction with tissue clearing techniques enables morphological investigation of large tissues faster and with excellent optical sectioning. Recently, cleared tissue axially swept light-sheet microscope (ctASLM) demonstrated three-dimensional isotropic resolution in millimeter-scaled tissues. But ASLM based microscopes suffer from low detection signal and slow imaging speed. Here we report a simple and efficient imaging platform that employs precise control of two fixed distant light-sheet foci to carry out ASLM. This allowed us to carry out full field of view (FOV) imaging at 40 frames per second (fps) which is a four-fold improvement compared to the current state-of-the-art. In addition, in a particular frame rate, our method doubles the signal compared to the current ASLM technique. To augment the overall imaging performance, we also developed a deep learning based tissue information classifier that enables faster determination of tissue boundary. We demonstrated the performance of our imaging platform on various cleared tissue samples and demonstrated its robustness over a wide range of clearing protocols.",

    "abstract": "During host cell invasion, microsporidian spores translocate their entire cytoplasmic content through a thin, hollow superstructure known as the polar tube. To achieve this, the polar tube transitions from a compact spring-like state inside the environmental spore to a long needle-like tube capable of long-range sporoplasm delivery. The unique mechanical properties of the building blocks of the polar tube allow for an explosive transition from compact to extended state and support the rapid cargo translocation process. The molecular and structural factors enabling this ultrafast process and the structural changes during cargo delivery are unknown. Here, we employ light microscopy and in situ cryo-electron tomography to visualize multiple ultrastructural states of the polar tube, allowing us to evaluate the kinetics of its germination and characterize the underlying morphological transitions. We describe a cargo-filled state with a unique ordered arrangement of microsporidian ribosomes, which cluster along the thin tube wall, and an empty post-translocation state with a reduced diameter but a thicker wall. Together with a proteomic analysis of endogenously affinity-purified polar tubes, our work provides comprehensive data on the infection apparatus of microsporidia and demonstrates that ribosomes are efficiently transported through polar tubes in a spiral-like parallel arrangement.",

    "abstract": "The growth potential of individual epithelial cells is a key determinant of tissue development, homeostasis, and disease progression. Although it is known that epithelial progenitor cells vary in their proliferative capacity, the cell states underlying these differences are yet to be uncovered. Here we performed clonal tracing through imaging and cellular barcoding of an in vitro model of esophageal epithelial cells (EPC2-hTERT). We found that individual clones possess unique growth and differentiation capacities, with a subset of clones growing exponentially. Further, we discovered that this proliferative potential for a clone is heritable through cell division and can be influenced by extrinsic cues from neighboring cells. Combining barcoding with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identified the cellular states associated with the highly proliferative clones, which include genes in the WNT and PI3K pathways. Importantly, we also identified a subset of cells resembling the highly proliferative cell state in the healthy human esophageal epithelium and, to a greater extent, in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). These findings highlight the physiological relevance of our cell line model, providing insights into the behavior of esophageal epithelial cells during homeostasis and disease.",

Built from attention layers, they require a mass comparison of queries and keys that is difficult to perform using traditional neural circuits. Here, we show that neurons can implement attention-like computations using short-term, Hebbian synaptic potentiation. We call our mechanism the match-and-control principle and it proposes that when activity in an axon is synchronous, or matched, with the somatic activity of a neuron that it synapses onto, the synapse can be briefly strongly potentiated, allowing the axon to take over, or control, the activity of the downstream neuron for a short time. In our scheme, the keys and queries are represented as spike trains and comparisons between the two are performed in individual spines allowing for hundreds of key comparisons per query and roughly as many keys and queries as there are neurons in the network.",

    "abstract": "The human brain is a complex network that can be summarized as a graph where nodes refer to anatomical brain regions while edges encode the neuronal interactions or structural connections between them at both the micro and macroscopic levels, allowing the application of graph theory to investigate the network brain architecture. Various network metrics have been proposed and adopted so far describing both local and global properties of the relevant brain network. It has been proposed that connectomic harmonic patterns that emerged from the brains structural network underlie the human brains resting-state activity. Connectome harmonics refer to Laplacian eigenfunctions of the structural connectivity matrices (2D) and is an extension of the well-known Fourier basis of a signal (1D). The estimation of the normalized graph Laplacian over a brain networks spectral decomposition can reveal the connectome harmonics (eigenvectors) corresponding to certain frequencies (eigenvalues). Here, we used test-retest dMRI data from the Human Connectome Project to explore the repeatability of connectome harmonics and eigenvalues across five graph construction schemes. Normalized Laplacian eigenvalues were found to be subject-specific and repeatable across the five graph construction schemes, but their range is highly dependent on the graph construction scheme. The repeatability of connectome harmonics is lower than that of the Laplacian eigenvalues and shows a heavy dependency on the graph construction scheme. In parallel, we investigated the properties of the structural networks and their relationship with the Laplacian spectrum. Our results provide a proof of concept for repeatable identification of the graph Laplacian spectrum of structural brain networks based on the selected graph construction scheme.",

    "abstract": "Organs age at different rates within a single individual. Such asynchrony in aging has been widely observed at multiple levels, from functional hallmarks, such as anatomical structures and physiological processes, to molecular endophenotypes, such as the transcriptome and metabolome. However, we lack a conceptual framework to understand why some components age faster than others. Just as demographic models explain why aging evolves, here we test the hypothesis that demographic differences among cell types, determined by cell-specific differences in turnover rate, can explain why the transcriptome shows signs of aging in some cell types but not others. Through analysis of mouse single-cell transcriptome data across diverse organs and ages, we find that cellular age explains a large proportion of the variation in the age-related increase in transcriptome variance. We further show that long-lived cells are characterized by relatively high expression of genes associated with proteostasis, and that the transcriptome of long-lived cells shows greater evolutionary constraint than short-lived cells. In contrast, in short-lived cell types the transcriptome is enriched for genes associated with DNA repair. Based on these observations, we develop a novel heuristic model that explains how and why aging rates differ among cell types.",

In this study, we utilized diffusion MRI automatic tractography to investigate the probabilistic coverage of the FAT in a large sample of 1065 young adults. Our primary goal was to reveal individual variability and lateralization of FAT and its structure-function correlations in language processing. Our results showed that the left anterior FAT exhibited the most substantial individual differences, particularly in the superior and middle frontal gyrus, with greater variability in the superior than the inferior region. Furthermore, we found significant left lateralization in FAT, with a greater difference in innervation coverage in the inferior and posterior portions. Additionally, our analysis revealed a significant correlation between the size of left FAT inferior innervation areas and Picture Vocabulary function, highlighting the structural and functional importance of the left FAT in language processing. In comparison, the anisotropy of FAT did not show significant correlation. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into individual and population differences in FAT connectivity and segmentation and sheds light on its critical role in language functions.",

    "abstract": "While continuing to develop new and improved OVs, researchers have been vigilant in optimizing their ability to safely infect, replicate, and induce an immune response within tumors. There are currently two crucial limitations in OV development, however: modification of viruses often negatively impact their ability to infect, and induction of strong immune responses also promotes rapid viral clearance. In this study, we investigate wild-type HRVs as a novel class of OV. Multiple HRV serotypes were propagated in human melanoma cell lines to produce highly oncolytic populations of virus. A large panel of cancer types were infected, with cytotoxicity evaluated using flow cytometry and real time live imaging. Pro-inflammatory signaling was assessed by cytokine multiplexing. Tumor responses to HRV were assessed in human xenograft and in syngeneic, immune-competent mouse tumor models. We find that HRVs are capable of infecting and killing a wide variety of human cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo, inducing pro-inflammatory responses and, ultimately, tumor regression. We propose that the natural safety profile of these viruses, coupled with their anti-tumor efficacy and multivalent potential seen in our preclinical model systems, make HRVs ideal candidates for development as oncolytic viruses for clinical testing.\n\nSimple SummaryThe idea of utilizing viruses to combat cancer has been around for over a century, yet in practice has seen relatively modest therapeutic success following decades of strategic design to improve safety, efficacy, and tumor selectivity. Engagement of an immune response is critical to have lasting tumor regression upon treatment, but many patients are unable to mount a sufficient response to standard-of-care immunotherapy alone. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) have been shown to synergize with such therapies to accomplish this goal to varying degrees. The purpose of this study is to investigate human rhinoviruses (HRVs) to establish their efficacy as a novel class of anti-cancer agents. We aim to use HRVs to promote longer lasting and more effective immune responses to tumors by fostering viral persistence and immune evasion, in addition to developing multivalent treatment strategies that enhance tumor regression by preventing tumor escape from viral infection.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWUnderstanding the dynamics to acute HIV infection may provide insights into the mechanisms of early viral control with potential implications for vaccine design. The standard viral dynamics model explains HIV viral dynamics during acute infection reasonably well. However, the model makes simplifying assumptions, neglecting some aspects of HIV. For example, in the standard model, target cells are infected by a single HIV virion. Yet, cellular multiplicity of infection (MOI) may have considerable effects in pathogenesis and viral evolution. Further, when using the standard model, we take constant infected cell death rates, simplifying the dynamic immune responses. Here, we use four models--1) the standard viral dynamics model, 2) an alternate model incorporating cellular MOI, 3) a model assuming density-dependent death rate of infected cells and 4) a model combining (2) and (3)--to investigate acute infection dynamics in 43 people tested very early after HIV exposure. We find that all models explain the data, but different models describe differing features of the dynamics more accurately. For example, while the standard viral dynamics model may be the most parsimonious model, viral peaks are better explained by a model allowing for cellular MOI. These results suggest that heterogeneity in within-host viral dynamics cannot be captured by a single model. Thus depending on the aspect of interest, a corresponding model should be employed.",

    "abstract": "The peptidoglycan (PG) layer of Escherichia coli is a single, interconnected gigaDalton molecule that is the largest in the cell. Experimental studies have established a number of the PGs properties, and previous computational studies have simulated aspects of its behavior on sub-cellular scales, but none have fully modeled the PGs compositional heterogeneity and no models have yet been constructed on the whole-cell scale. Here we use a combination of computational modeling approaches to construct whole-cell PG models at a resolution of one coarse-grained (CG) bead per glycan that are consistent with a wide variety of available experimental data. In particular, we derive plausible glycan strand length distributions for the polar and cylindrical regions of the cell that cover the full range of possible strand lengths and that are consistent with all available experimental data. In addition, we develop stochastic simulation code that explicitly models a cross-linking experiment from the literature that has a direct bearing on the extent to which Brauns lipoprotein (Lpp) is partitioned between periplasmic and surface-exposed locations. We then use all of these data as inputs to a new computer code, PG_maker, which builds CG models of the PG on a whole-cell scale in under an hour. Finally, we use the resulting 3D models as a basis for: (a) estimating pore size distributions - which, despite the idealized nature of the models, are shown to be in surprisingly good agreement with experimental estimates - and (b) calculating the effects of the large numbers of periplasmic Lpps on the ability of freely diffusing proteins to access the compartment that lies between the PG and the outer membrane. The ability to combine a wide range of experimental data into structural models that are physically realizable in 3D helps to set the stage for performing simulations of the PG on the whole-cell scale in the near future.",
