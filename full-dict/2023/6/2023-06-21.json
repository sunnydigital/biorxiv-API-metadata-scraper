    "abstract": "Both genetic and phenotypic intraspecific diversity play a crucial role in the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of organisms. Several studies have compared phenotypic divergence (Pst) and differentiation of neutral loci (Fst) to infer the relative roles of genetic drift and natural selection in population differentiation (Pst - Fst comparison). For the first time, we assessed and compared the genetic variation and differentiation at the leaf trait level in two key macrophytes, Phragmites australis and Nuphar lutea.\n\nTo this aim, we quantified and described the genetic structure and phenotypic diversity of both species in five lake systems in north-central Italy. We then investigated the relative roles of genetic drift and natural selection on leaf trait differentiation (Pst - Fst), assuming that Fst reflects divergence caused only by genetic drift while Pst also incorporates the effects of selective dynamics on the phenotype.\n\nIn terms of genetic structure, the results for P. australis were in line with those observed for other Italian and European conspecific populations. Conversely, N. lutea showed a more complex genetic structure than expected at the site level, likely due to the combined effect of genetic isolation and its mixed mating system. Both species exhibited high variability in leaf functional traits within and among sites, highlighting a high degree of phenotypic plasticity. Pst - Fst comparisons showed a general tendency towards directional selection in P. australis and a more complex pattern in N. lutea. Indeed, the drivers of phenotypic differentiation in N. lutea showed a variable mix of stabilizing and directional selection or neutral divergence at most sites.\n\nThe prevalence of vegetative over generative reproduction leads P. australis populations to be dominated by a few clones that are well adapted to local conditions, including phenotypes that respond plastically to the environment. In contrast, in N. lutea the interaction of a mixed mating system and geographical isolation among distant sites tends to reduce the effect of outbreeding depression and provides the genetic basis for adaptive capacity.\n\nThe first joint analysis of the genetic structure of these two key macrophytes allowed a better understanding of the relative roles of genetic drift and natural selection in the diversification of phenotypic traits within habitats dominated by P. australis and N. lutea.",

We evaluated performance of different BBnet variants based on the PermaNet 3 (i.e., P3 BBnets with pyrethroid and piperonyl butoxide (PBO) on the roof or barrier; pyrethroid alone on the side walls) in room-scale bioassays, simultaneously video-recorded to track mosquitoes. Experimental results showed the longitudinal P3 barrier (P3L) to be highly effective: P3+P3L were consistently though not significantly more effective than the reference P3 bednet while performance of Ut+P3L was comparable to the reference P3. Comparing contact duration at the treated sections of each variant, the Ut+P3L accumulated 1273 contacts with 1374 seconds duration, all on the barrier, greatly exceeding the 792 seconds duration, from 8049 contacts, accumulated across the entire surface of the PermaNet 3 reference bednet. The BBnets potential to augment existing bednets and enhance their performance is considered.",

    "abstract": "Cuttlefish skin is a powerful rendering device, capable of producing extraordinary changes in visual appearance over a broad range of temporal scales. This unique ability is typically associated with camouflage, however cuttlefish often produce skin patterns that do not appear connected with the surrounding environment, such as fast large-scale fluctuations with wave-like characteristics. Little is known about the functional significance of these dynamic patterns. In this study, we manipulate the internal state of cuttlefish without altering their sensory environments, and study potential changes in the associated pattern dynamics. When cuttlefish are engaged in feeding, we observe accentuated dynamics of specific pattern components within the theta frequency range, with additional evidence of increased display for other components. These changes disappear during the post-feeding phase, which resembles the pre-feeding phase, indicating that they last for a relatively short time between 10 and 20 minutes. Our findings therefore reveal specific alterations of skin pattern dynamics that correspond to changes of internal state associated with self-driven non-sensory behavior.",

    "abstract": "Particle-based (granular) hydrogels are an attractive class of biomaterials due to their unique properties and array of applications in the biomedical space - serving as platforms for extrusion printing and injecting as well as permissive materials for 3D cell culture. Physical properties of particle-based hydrogels are governed in part by contact forces between particles, which are limited to interactions with neighboring particles. Secondary annealing mechanisms are often used to increase mechanical properties and serve to link particles across the granular material volume. Here, we present a novel particle-based hydrogel where each \"particle\" is a discrete electrospun hydrogel microfiber that has been segmented to a length of 93 {+/-} 51 m, with a diameter of 1.6 {+/-} 0.3 m. The fibers are flexible and have aspect ratios that are greater than one order of magnitude larger than most traditional hydrogel microparticles. This enables long-range entanglements of discrete fibers following packing into a bulk material, yielding unique properties. Without crosslinking, these packed hydrogel microfiber materials are mechanically robust, they can stretch without breaking when strained, and they exhibit stress relaxation under constant strain. As a cell culture scaffold, shear-induced alignment of the individual fibers within 3D printed filaments confers contact guidance cues to cells and promotes anisotropic cellular morphologies. Packed hydrogel microfibers can also be used as 3D cell culture environments, with cells able to spread due to the permissive nature of the scaffold. Overall, this work introduces a particle-based material system comprised of individual hydrogel microfibers that allows unique properties to be engineered into biomaterials that might be used in extrusion processes and cell cultures and, ultimately, in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.",

Stage-specific expression of transposable elements (TEs) has been detected during zebrafish EHT and may promote hematopoietic stem cell formation by activating inflammatory signaling. However, little is known about how TEs contribute to the EHT process in human and mouse.\n\nResultsWe reconstructed the single-cell EHT trajectories of human and mouse, and resolved the dynamic expression patterns of TEs during EHT. Most TEs presented a transient co-upregulation pattern along the conserved EHT trajectories. Enhanced TE activation was tightly associated with the temporal relaxation of epigenetic silencing systems. TE products can be sensed by multiple pattern recognition receptors, triggering inflammatory signaling to facilitate the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells. Furthermore, we observed that hypoxia-related signals were enriched in cells with higher TE expression. Additionally, we constructed the hematopoietic cis-regulatory network of accessible TEs and identified potential enhancers derived by TEs, which may boost the expression of specific EHT marker genes.\n\nConclusionsOur study provides a systematic vision on how TEs are dynamically controlled to promote the hematopoietic fate decision through transcriptional and cis-regulatory networks, and pre-train the immunity of nascent hematopoietic stem cells.",

Although the exact physiological function of GDF15 is not yet fully comprehended, the significant elevation of circulating GDF15 levels during gestation suggests a potential role for this hormone in pregnancy. This is corroborated by genetic association studies in which GDF15 and the GDF15 receptor, GDNF Family Receptor Alpha Like (GFRAL) have been linked to morning sickness and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) in humans. Here, we studied GDF15 biology during pregnancy in mice, rats, macaques, and humans. In contrast to macaques and humans, mice and rats exhibited an underwhelming induction in plasma GDF15 levels in response to pregnancy ([~]75-fold increase in macaques vs. [~]2-fold increase in rodents). The changes in circulating GDF15 levels were corroborated by the magnitude of Gdf15 mRNA and GDF15 protein expression in placentae from mice, rats, and macaques.

    "abstract": "The human brain is a highly dynamic system, and the methods we use to analyze the data gathered from this organ should account for this dynamism. One such family of methods that has attracted a lot of attention in the past decades is based on networks. The most well-known method for estimating the connection among these networks uses the sliding window Pearson correlation (SWPC) estimator. Although quite a useful tool, there are some important limitations. One such limitation is that SWPC applies a high pass filter to the activity time series. If we select a small window size (which is desirable to estimate rapid changes in functional connectivity), we will filter out important low-frequency activity information. In this work, we propose an approach based on single sideband modulation (SSB) in communication theory, which aims to solve this issue, allowing us to select smaller window sizes and capture rapid changes in the time-resolved functional connectivity. We use both simulation and real data to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method, SSB+SWPC, compared to classical SWPC. In addition, we compare the temporal recurring functional connectivity patterns between individuals with the first episode of psychosis (FEP) and typical controls (TC) and show that FEP stays more in FNC states that show weaker connectivity across the whole brain. A result exclusive to SSB+SWPC is that TC stays more in a state with negative connectivity between sub-cortical and cortical regions. All in all, based on both simulated data and real data, we argue that the proposed method, SSB+SWPC, is more sensitive for capturing temporal variation in functional connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Measures of functional connectivity have played a central role in advancing our understanding of how information is communicated within the brain. Traditionally, these studies have focused on identifying redundant functional connectivity, which involves determining when activity is similar across different sites. However, recent research has highlighted the potential importance of also identifying synergistic connectivity--that is, connectivity that gives rise to information not contained in either site alone. Here, we measured redundant and synergistic functional connectivity with individual-neuron resolution in the primary auditory cortex of the mouse during a perceptual task. Specifically, we identified pairs of neurons that exhibited directed functional connectivity between them, as measured using Granger Causality. We then used Partial Information Decomposition to quantify the amount of redundant and synergystic information carried by these neurons about auditory stimuli. Our findings revealed that functionally connected pairs carry proportionally more redundancy and less synergy than unconnected pairs, suggesting that their functional connectivity is primarily redundant in nature. Furthermore, we observe that the proportion of redundancy is higher for correct than for incorrect behavioral choices, supporting the notion that redundant connectivity is beneficial for behavior.",

Here, we uncover a novel mechanism that mechanically regulates the shape of the anterior neural plate (ANP), a vital forebrain precursor, during zebrafish gastrulation. Combining in vivo and in silico approaches we reveal that the ANP is shaped by global tissue flows regulated by distinct force generating processes. We show that mesendoderm migration and E-cadherin-dependent differential tissue interactions control distinct flow regimes in the neuroectoderm. Initial opposing flows lead to progressive tissue folding and neuroectoderm internalisation which in turn provide forces driving ANP tissue reshaping. We find that convergent extension is dispensable for internalisation but required for ANP tissue extension. Our results highlight how spatiotemporal regulation and coupling of different mechanical processes between tissues in the embryo controls the first folding event in the developing brain.",

Here, we investigated the geographic distribution of mono- and sesquiterpenoid chemotypes in tansy leaves and the effects of these chemotypes on colonization by insect communities across Germany.\n\nMethodsWe sampled tansy leaves from 26 sites along a north-south and west-east transect in Germany. Leaves from ten plants with and five plants without aphids was collected from each site. Hexane-extracted metabolites from leaf tissues were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Plant morphological traits, aphid occurrence and abundance, and occurrence of ants were recorded. The effect of plant chemotype, plant morphological parameters, and site parameters such as temperature and precipitation on insect occurrences were analysed.\n\nResultsPlants clustered into four monoterpenoid and four sesquiterpenoid chemotype classes. Monoterpene classes differed in their latitudinal distribution, whereas sesquiterpenes were more evenly distributed across the transect. Aphid and ant occurrence were influenced by monoterpenoids and specific traits. Plants of monoterpenoid class 1 were colonized by Metopeurum fuscoviride and ants significantly more often than expected by chance compared to plants from monoterpenoid class 4. Aphid abundance was negatively affected by host plant height, and increasing average annual temperature positively influenced the occurrence of ants.\n\nConclusionWe found significant geographic differences in the chemodiversity of tansy and show that monoterpenoids affect aphid and ant occurrence, while host plant height can influence aphid abundance.

    "abstract": "Facing climate change and biodiversity loss, it is critical that ecology advances such that processes, such as species interactions and dynamics, can be correctly estimated and skillfully forecasted. As different processes occur on different time scales, the sampling frequency used to record them should intuitively match these scales. Yet, the effect of data sampling frequency on forecasting accuracy is understudied. Using a simple simulated dataset as a baseline and a more complex high-frequency plankton dataset, we tested how different sampling frequencies impacted abundance forecasts of different plankton classes and the estimation of their interactions. We then investigated whether plankton growth rates and body sizes could be used to select the most appropriate sampling frequency. The simple simulated dataset showed that the optimal sampling frequency scaled positively with growth rate. This finding was not repeated in the analyses of the plankton time series, however. There, we found that a reduction in sampling frequency worsened forecasts and led us to both over- and underestimate plankton interactions. This suggests that forecasting can be used to determine the ideal sampling frequency in scientific and monitoring programs. A better study design will improve theoretical understanding of ecology and advance policy measures dealing with current global challenges.\n\nOpen research statement: Data and code used for the analyses and figures are available on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7970886.

In Brassicaceae, this process is regulated by the complex formation of the pistil determinant S receptor kinase (SRK) and the pollen determinant S-locus protein 11 (SP11, also known as S-locus cysteine-rich protein, SCR). In our previous study, we demonstrated that only the SRK ectodomain (eSRK) and SP11 pairs derived from the same S haplotype exhibit high binding free energy based on the crystal structures of two eSRK-SP11 complexes in Brassica rapa S8 and S9 haplotypes and nine computationally predicted complex models. However, predicting the eSRK-SP11 complex structures for the other 100+ S haplotypes and genera remains difficult because of the SP11 polymorphism in sequence and structure. Although protein structure prediction using AlphaFold2 exhibits considerably high accuracy for most protein monomers and complexes, 46% of predicted SP11 structures we tested showed per-residue mean pLDDT < 75. Here, we demonstrate that the use of curated multiple sequence alignment (MSA) for cysteine-rich proteins significantly improves the model accuracy for SP11 and eSRK-SP11 complexes. Additionally, we calculated the binding free energies of the predicted eSRK-SP11 complexes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and observed that some Arabidopsis haplotypes formed a binding mode that was critically different from that of B. rapa S8 and S9. Thus, these computational results provide insights into the haplotype-specific eSRK-SP11 binding modes in Brassicaceae and could be adopted as a general method for obtaining more accurate models for other cysteine-rich proteins.",

Here, we present a systematic characterization of LSD metabolites in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans using state-of-the-art analytical techniques. By employing ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS), we identified and quantified a range of LSD metabolites, shedding light on their metabolic pathways and offering insights into their pharmacokinetics. Our study demonstrates the suitability of C. elegans as a valuable model system for investigating the metabolism of psychedelic compounds and provides a foundation for further research on the therapeutic potential of LSD.

    "abstract": "Mistakes in performance feel disappointing, suggesting that brain pathways for aversive feedback may play a role in motor learning. Here we tested if the lateral habenula (LHb), an evolutionarily conserved part of the limbic system known in mammals to relay aversive feedback from ventral pallidum (VP) to ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons, is involved in birdsong learning and production. By combining viral tract tracing and functional circuit mapping, we discovered that songbird LHb links VP and an auditory cortical area to singing-related DA neurons that signal song errors. As in mammals, VP stimulation activated LHb activity and LHb stimulation suppressed DA firing. To test this pathways role in learning we lesioned the LHb in juvenile zebra finches and recorded their songs in adulthood. Birds with the LHb lesioned as juveniles produced highly unusual vocalizations as adults, including prolonged high-pitch notes and species-atypical trills. These findings identify a songbird VP-LHb-VTA pathway with similar functional connectivity as mammals, expand the known territories of vocal learning circuits, and demonstrate that limbic circuits associated with disappointing outcomes are important for motor performance learning.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the plasticity of neuronal networks is an emerging field of (patho-)physiological research, yet little is known about the underlying cellular mechanisms. Gamma-oscillations (30 - 80 Hz), a biomarker of cognitive performance, require and potentiate glutamatergic transmission onto parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVIs), suggesting an interface for cell-to-network plasticity. In ex vivo local field potential recordings, we demonstrate long-term potentiation of hippocampal gamma-power. Gamma-potentiation obeys established rules of PVI plasticity, requiring calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). A microcircuit model of CA3 gamma-oscillations predicts CP-AMPAR plasticity onto PVIs critically outperforms pyramidal cell plasticity in increasing gamma-power and completely accounts for gamma-potentiation. We re-affirm this ex vivo in three PVI-targeting animal models, demonstrating that gamma-potentiation requires PVI-specific metabotropic signaling via a Gq/PKC-pathway comprising mGluR5 and a Gi-sensitive, PKA-dependent pathway. Gamma-activity dependent, metabotropically mediated CP-AMPAR plasticity on PVIs may serve as a guiding principle in understanding network plasticity in health and disease.",

However, in globally threatened marine megafauna, challenges remain due to their elusive nature and wide-ranging distributions. As overexploitation continues to threaten biodiversity across the globe, such knowledge gaps compromise both the suitability and effectiveness of management actions. Here, we use a comparative framework to investigate genetic differentiation and diversity of manta rays, one of the most iconic yet vulnerable groups of elasmobranchs on the planet. Despite their recent divergence, we show how oceanic manta rays (Mobula birostris) display significantly higher genetic diversity than reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi) and that M. birostris populations display higher connectivity worldwide. Through reconstructing modes of colonisation, we reveal how both contemporary and historical forces have likely influenced these patterns, with important implications for population management. Our findings highlight the potential for fisheries to disrupt population dynamics at both local and global scales and therefore have direct relevance for international marine conservation.\n\nTeaserPopulation genomics of manta rays reveals striking differences in differentiation and diversity between two recently diverged species.",

    "abstract": "Hair shed by domestic cats is a potentially useful source of forensic evidence. Analysable hair DNA is predominantly mitochondrial, but the recent domestication history of cats means that mtDNA diversity is low. A 402-bp control region segment is usually sequenced, defining only a small number of distinct mitotypes in populations. Previously, we used a long-amplicon approach to sequence whole mitogenomes in a sample of blood DNAs from 119 UK cats, greatly increasing observed diversity and reducing random match probabilities. To exploit this variation for forensic analysis, we here describe a multiplex system that amplifies the cat mitogenome in 60 overlapping amplicons of mean length 360 bp, followed by Nanopore sequencing. Variants detected in multiplex sequence data from hair completely mirror those from long-amplicon data from blood from the same individuals. However, applying the multiplex to matched blood DNA reveals additional sequence variants which derive from the major feline nuclear mitochondrial insertion sequence (numt), which covers 7.9 kb of the 17-kb mitogenome and exists in multiple tandem copies. We use long-amplicon Nanopore sequencing to investigate numt variation in a set of cats, together with an analysis of published genome sequences, and show that numt arrays are variable in both structure and sequence, thus providing a potential source of uncertainty when nuclear DNA predominates in a sample. Forensic application of the test was demonstrated by matching hairs from a cat with skeletal remains from its putative mother, both of which shared a globally common mitotype at the control region. The random match probability (RMP) in this case with the CR 402-bp segment was 0.21 and this decreased to 0.03 when considering the whole mitogenome. The developed multiplex and sequencing approach, when applied to cat hair where nuclear DNA is scarce, can provide a reliable and highly discriminating source of forensic genetic evidence. The confounding effect of numt co-amplification in degraded samples where mixed sequences are observed can be mitigated by variant phasing, and by comparison with numt sequence diversity data, such as those presented here.",

We developed a consistent approach for understanding the formation of the two key common building blocks of helices and sheets as well as the compatible assembly of secondary structures into the tertiary structure through the notion of poking pairwise interactions. Here we benchmark our predictions with a detailed analysis of structural data of over 4000 proteins from the Protein Data Bank. We also present the results of detailed computer simulations of a simplified model demonstrating a pre-sculpted free energy landscape, determined by geometry and symmetry, comprising numerous minima corresponding to putative native state structures.

The aim of this study was to determine whether: APOE genotype affects brain grey (GM) or white matter (WM) structure; and if differences exist, the age when they become apparent and whether there are differential effects by sex. We used cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging data from ~43,000 (28,494 after pre-processing) white British cognitively healthy participants (7,446 APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers) aged 45-80 years from the UK Biobank cohort and investigated image-derived phenotypes (IDPs). We observed no statistically significant effects of APOE genotype on GM structure volumes or median T2* in subcortical structures, a measure related to iron content. Volume of white matter hyperintensities differed significantly between APOE genotype groups with higher volumes in APOE {varepsilon}4{varepsilon}4 (effect size 0.14 standard deviations [SD]) and {varepsilon}3{varepsilon}4 carriers (effect size 0.04 SD) but no differences in {varepsilon}2 carriers compared with {varepsilon}3{varepsilon}3 carriers. WM integrity measures in the dorsal (mean diffusivity [MD]) and ventral cingulum (MD and intracellular volume fraction), posterior thalamic radiation (MD and isotropic volume fraction) and sagittal stratum (MD) indicated lower integrity in APOE {varepsilon}4{varepsilon}4 carriers (effect sizes around 0.2-0.3 SD) and {varepsilon}3{varepsilon}4 (effect sizes around 0.05 SD) carriers but no differences in {varepsilon}2 carriers compared with the APOE {varepsilon}3{varepsilon}3 genotype. Effects did not differ between men and women. APOE {varepsilon}4 homozygotes appeared to have lower WM integrity specifically at older ages with a potentially steeper decline of WM integrity from the age of 60 that corresponds to around 5 years greater \"brain age\". APOE genotype affects various white matters measures, which might be indicative of preclinical AD processes. This hypothesis can be assessed in future when clinical outcomes become available.",

To this end, networks frequently rely on uniform expression of modulatory receptors by distinct classes of neurons to fine tune the computations supported by each neuronal class. In this study, we explore the consequences of heterogeneous, rather than uniform, serotonin (5-HT) receptor expression within a cell class for olfactory processing in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we demonstrate that two distinct populations of olfactory output neurons (projection neurons, PNs) display heterogeneous receptor co-expression of all 5-HT receptors. Moreover, the PN populations that express distinct 5-HT receptors innervate different combinations of glomeruli, implying that the effects of 5-HT on these PNs may vary with their odor tuning. Furthermore, connectomic analyses reveal that PN subsets with different receptor profiles have little convergence upon downstream synaptic partners. Finally, 5-HT differentially modulates the odor-evoked responses of PNs with distinct receptor expression profiles and odor tuning. Overall, this implies that heterogeneous modulatory receptor expression enables differential tuning of activity within a neuronal class depending on the odor scene to which individual neurons respond.",

In this study, we exploited the imaging properties of lanthanides by encapsulating CaF2:Y, Nd along with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) into poly (D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) to prepare a nanoplatform suitable for imaging in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window and simultaneous anti-cancer therapy. To facilitate the accumulation of CaF2:Y, Nd+DOX@PLGA NPs in breast cancer cells, we modified the NPs with EGF. The diameter of the obtained CaF2:Y, Nd+DOX@PLGA/PEG/EGF NPs was approximately 150 nm, with a nearly round shape and homogeneous size distribution. In addition, analysis of the drug release behaviour showed that DOX was released more readily and had a longer release time in acidic environments. Accordingly, MTS results indicated that DOX-loaded NPs were significantly cytotoxic. Furthermore, fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry studies revealed that CaF2:Y, Nd+DOX@PLGA/PEG and CaF2:Y, Nd+DOX@PLGA/PEG/EGF NPs were gradually taken up by 4T1 breast cancer cells over time, and EGF-coated Nd+DOX@PLGA NPs exhibited increased uptake rates after 72 h. Moreover, we found that EGF increased the solubility of Nd+DOX@PLGA NPs in water by comparing the aqueous solutions of the different NPs formulations. Finally, NIR imaging demonstrated strong fluorescence of PLGA NPs carrying CaF2:Y, Nd NPs at 900-1200 nm under 808 nm laser excitation. In conclusion, the developed CaF2:Y, Nd+DOX@PLGA/PEG/EGF NPs could be monitored for an extended period of time, and co-encapsulated DOX could be efficiently released to kill breast cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Proper cortical lamination is essential for cognition, learning, and memory. Within the somatosensory cortex, pyramidal excitatory neurons elaborate axon collateral branches in a laminar-specific manner that dictates synaptic partners and overall circuit organization. Here, we leverage mouse models, single-cell labeling and imaging approaches to identify intrinsic regulators of laminar-specific collateral, also termed interstitial, axon branching. We developed new approaches for the robust, sparse, labeling of layer II/III pyramidal neurons to obtain single-cell quantitative assessment of axon branch morphologies. We combined these approaches with cell-autonomous loss-of-function (LOF) and over-expression (OE) manipulations in an in vivo candidate screen to identify regulators of cortical neuron axon branch lamination. We identify a role for the cytoskeletal binding protein drebrin (Dbn1) in regulating layer II/III cortical projection neuron (CPN) collateral axon branching in vitro. LOF experiments show that Dbn1 is necessary to suppress the elongation of layer II/III CPN collateral axon branches within layer IV, where axon branching by layer II/III CPNs is normally absent. Conversely, Dbn1 OE produces excess short axonal protrusions reminiscent of nascent axon collaterals that fail to elongate. Structure-function analyses implicate Dbn1S142 phosphorylation and Dbn1 protein domains known to mediate F-actin bundling and microtubule (MT) coupling as necessary for collateral branch initiation upon Dbn1 OE. Taken together, these results contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate collateral axon branching in excitatory CPNs, a key process in the elaboration of neocortical circuit formation.\n\nSignificance StatementLaminar-specific axon targeting is essential for cortical circuit formation. Here, we show that the cytoskeletal protein drebrin (Dbn1) regulates excitatory layer II/III cortical projection neuron (CPN) collateral axon branching, lending insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie neocortical laminar-specific innervation. To identify branching patterns of single cortical neurons in vivo, we have developed tools that allow us to obtain detailed images of individual CPN morphologies throughout postnatal development and to manipulate gene expression in these same neurons. Our results showing that Dbn1 regulates CPN interstitial axon branching both in vivo and in vitro and may aid in our understanding of how aberrant cortical neuron morphology contributes to dysfunctions observed in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "When making decisions, humans aim to maximize rewards while minimizing costs. The exertion of mental or physical effort has been proposed to be one those costs, translating into avoidance of behaviors carrying effort demands. This motivational framework also predicts that people should experience positive affect when anticipating demand that is subsequently avoided (i.e., a \"relief effect\"), but evidence for this prediction is scarce. Here, we follow up on a previous study (1) that provided some initial evidence that people more positively evaluated outcomes if it meant they could avoid performing an additional demanding task. However, the results from this study did not provide evidence that this effect was driven by effort avoidance. Here, we report two experiments that are able to do this. Participants performed a gambling task, and if they did not receive reward they would have to perform an orthogonal effort task. Prior to the gamble, a cue indicated whether this effort task would be easy or hard. We probed hedonic responses to the reward-related feedback, as well as after the subsequent effort task feedback. Participants reported lower hedonic responses for no-reward outcomes when high vs. low effort was anticipated (and later exerted). They also reported higher hedonic responses for reward outcomes when high vs. low effort was anticipated (and avoided). Importantly, this relief effect was smaller in participants with high need for cognition. These results suggest that avoidance of high effort tasks is rewarding, but that the size off this effect depends on the individual disposition to engage with and expend cognitive effort. They also raise the important question of whether this disposition alters the cost of effort per se, or rather offset this cost during cost-benefit analyses.",

    "abstract": "Teleost fish form the largest group of vertebrates, making them critically important for the study on the mechanisms of brain evolution. In fact, teleosts show a tremendous variety of adaptive behaviors similar to birds and mammals, however, the neural basis mediating these behaviors remains elusive. We performed a systematic comparative survey of the goldfish telencephalon; the seat of plastic behavior, learning and memory in vertebrates. We delineated and mapped goldfish telencephalon cell types using single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics, resulting in de novo molecular neuroanatomy parcellation. Glial cells were highly conserved across 450 million years of evolution separating mouse and goldfish, while neurons showed diversity and modularity in gene expression. Specifically, somatostatin (SST) interneurons, famously interspersed in the mammalian isocortex for local inhibitory input, were curiously aggregated in a single goldfish telencephalon nucleus, but molecularly conserved. Cerebral nuclei including the striatum, a hub for motivated behavior in amniotes, had molecularly and spatially conserved goldfish homologues. We further suggest different elements of a hippocampal\n\nformation across the goldfish pallium. Together, our atlas provides new insights to organization and evolution of vertebrate forebrains and may serve as a resource for the functional study underlying cognition in teleost fish.\n\nTeaserDetailed mapping of goldfish forebrain cells unwraps how 450 million years of evolution may have impacted brain function",

    "abstract": "Everyday environments often contain multiple concurrent sound sources that fluctuate over time. Normally hearing listeners can benefit from high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in energetic dips of temporally fluctuating background sound, a phenomenon called dip-listening. Specialized mechanisms of dip-listening exist across the entire auditory pathway. Both the instantaneous fluctuating and the long-term overall SNR shape dip-listening. An unresolved issue regarding cortical mechanisms of dip-listening is how target perception remains invariant to overall SNR, specifically, across different tone levels with an ongoing fluctuating masker. Equivalent target detection over both positive and negative overall SNRs (SNR invariance) is reliably achieved in highly-trained listeners. Dip-listening is correlated with the ability to resolve temporal fine structure, which involves temporally-varying spike patterns. Thus the current work tests the hypothesis that at negative SNRs, neuronal readout mechanisms need to increasingly rely on decoding strategies based on temporal spike patterns, as opposed to spike count. Recordings from chronically implanted electrode arrays in core auditory cortex of trained and awake Mongolian gerbils that are engaged in a tone detection task in 10 Hz amplitude-modulated background sound reveal that rate-based decoding is not SNR-invariant, whereas temporal coding is informative at both negative and positive SNRs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEarly adverse experiences are assumed to affect fundamental processes of reward learning and decision-making. However, computational neuroimaging studies investigating these circuits are sparse and limited to studies that investigated adversities retrospectively in adolescent samples.\n\nMethodsWe used prospective data from a longitudinal birth cohort study (n=156, 87 females, mean age=32.2) to investigate neurocomputational components underlying reinforcement learning in an fMRI-based passive avoidance task. We applied a principal component analysis to capture common variation across seven prenatal and postnatal adversity measures. The resulting adversity factors (factor 1: postnatal psychosocial adversities and prenatal maternal smoking, factor 2: prenatal maternal stress and obstetric adversity, and factor 3: lower maternal stimulation) and single adversity measures were then linked to computational markers of reward learning (i.e. expected value, prediction errors) in the core reward network.\n\nResultsUsing the adversity factors, we found that adversities were linked to lower expected value representation in striatum, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Expected value encoding in vmPFC further mediated the relationship between adversities and psychopathology. In terms of specific adversity effects, we found that obstetric adversity was associated with lower prediction error signaling in the vmPFC and ACC, whereas lower maternal stimulation was related to lower expected value encoding in the striatum, vmPFC, and ACC.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggested that adverse experiences have a long-term disruptive effect on reward learning in several important reward-related brain regions, which can be associated with non-optimal decision-making and thereby increase the vulnerability of developing psychopathology.",

    "abstract": "This research explores the effects of drowsiness on variability in functional connectivity (FC) during resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The study utilized a cohort of students (MRi-Share) and classified individuals into drowsy (N=68), alert (N=96), and mixed/undetermined states based on observed respiratory oscillations. Five different processing methods were employed, the reference method, two correction methods based on physiological and global regression approaches, and two based on Gaussian standardizations. According to the reference methodology, the results indicate that drowsy individuals exhibit higher cortico-cortical FC than alert individuals. However, the differences between drowsy and alert states were reduced when applying correction methods based on physiological and global regression approaches. The global regression-based strategy was the most effective among these correction methods, minimizing significant FC differences to only 3.3% of the total FCs. Utilizing the Gaussian-based methods, both cortico-subcortical and intra-default mode network regions demonstrated significantly greater FCs in awake than drowsy subjects. These findings align with previous studies suggesting that, in the descent to sleep, the cortex isolates itself to facilitate the transition into deeper sleep stages while also disconnecting the default mode network. The Gaussian standardization methods and the global regression-based correction approach efficiently address the hemodynamic variations caused by the rapid alternation between the N1 stage and wakefulness. These variations contribute to the measurement of cortico-cortical pseudo connectivity observed in the reference methodology. In summary, these findings underscore the importance of considering drowsiness in rs-fMRI studies and demonstrate that there is no single optimal correction methodology for processing fMRI data",

    "abstract": "Recent work on bats flying over long distances has revealed that single hippocampal cells represent space on many scales, suggesting that these cells simultaneously participate in multiple neuronal networks to yield a multi-scale, multi-field place cell code. While the first theoretical analyses revealed that this code outperforms classical single-scale, single-field place codes, it remains an open question what the performance boundaries of this code are, what functional properties the network responsible for this code has, and how it compares to a highly regular grid code, in which cells form distinct modules, each with its own attractor dynamics on the network.\n\nIn this paper we address these questions with rigorous analyses of comprehensive simulations. Specifically, we perform an evolutionary optimization of several multi-scale, multi-field place cell networks and compare the results against a single-scale, single-field as well as against a simple grid code. We focus on two main characteristics: the general performance of the code itself and the dynamics of the network generating it. Our simulation experiments show that, under normal conditions, the grid code easily outperforms any multi-scale, multi-field place code with respect to decoding accuracy. However, the latter is more robust to noise and lesions, such as drop-out. The robustness comes at a cost, as the grid code requires a significantly smaller number of neurons and fields per neuron. Further analyses of the network dynamics also revealed that the proposed topology of multi-scale, multi-field place cells does not, in fact, result in a continuous attractor network. More precisely, the simulated networks do not maintain activity bumps without position specific input. The multi-scale, multi-field code, therefore, seems to be a compromise between a place code and a grid code that invokes a trade-off between accurate positional encoding and robustness.",

    "abstract": "Spatial memories are represented by hippocampal place cells during navigation. This spatial code is dynamic, undergoing changes across time - known as drift - and across changes in internal state, even while navigating the same spatial environment with consistent behavior. A dynamic spatial code may be a way for the hippocampus to track distinct episodes that occur at different times or during different internal states and update spatial memories. Changes to the spatial code include place fields that remap to new locations and place fields that vanish, while others are stable. However, what determines place field fate across episodes remains unclear. We measured the lap-by-lap properties of place cells in mice during navigation for a block of trials in a rewarded virtual environment. We then had mice navigate the same spatial environment for another block of trials either separated by a day (a distinct temporal episode) or during the same session but with reward removed to change reward expectation (a distinct internal state episode). We found that, as a population, place cells with remapped place fields across episodes had lower spatial precision during navigation in the initial episode. Place cells with stable or vanished place fields generally had higher spatial precision. We conclude that place cells with less precise place fields have greater spatial flexibility, allowing them to respond to, and track, distinct episodes in the same spatial environment, while place cells with precise place fields generally preserve spatial information when their fields reappear.",

    "abstract": "Many fish species display clear temporal separation between prolonged periods of energetically costly gonadal development, and short spawning events. These two distinct processes are controlled by the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), respectively. While it was suggested that a common secretagogue, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), controls both functions, it is unclear how the secretion of the two gonadotropins is differentially regulated. Here, we used in vivo and ex vivo calcium imaging of zebrafish gonadotrophs to study the regulation of gonadotropin release in fish. We show that while LH cells are highly responsive to GnRH stimulation, the response of FSH cells is weak and inconsistent. By combining transcriptomics and calcium imaging, we found that FSH cells express the receptor for the satiety hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) and display a strong calcium response to its application, accompanied by FSH secretion, which designates this peptide as a bona fide FSH secretagogue. From an evolutionary perspective, these findings indicate that the control of folliculogenesis and ovulation in fish was placed under different neural circuits, which respond to the specific somatic and environmental cues relevant to each process.",

We discovered X-chromosome-wide locus- and lineage-specific dynamic usage of the two X-chromosomal alleles in female cells induced by differentiation. Leveraging iPSCs derived from patients with an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder, we demonstrate that activation of alleles on the inactive X-chromosome can exert protective effects on the manifestation of disease phenotypes in female neural cells and tissue.

    "abstract": "A prevalent view in treating age-dependent disorders including Alzheimers disease (AD) is that the underlying amyloid plaque pathology must be targeted for cognitive improvements. In contrast, we report here that repeated scanning ultrasound (SUS) treatment at 1 MHz frequency can ameliorate memory deficits in the APP23 mouse model of AD without reducing amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) burden. Different from previous studies that had shown A{beta} clearance as a consequence of blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening, here, the BBB was not opened as no microbubbles were used. Quantitative proteomics and functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that ultrasound induced long-lasting functional changes that correlate with the improvement in memory. Intriguingly, the treatment was more effective at a higher frequency (1MHz) than at a frequency within the range currently explored in clinical trials in AD patients (286 kHz). Together, our data suggest frequency-dependent bio-effects of ultrasound and a dissociation of cognitive improvement and A{beta} clearance, with important implications for the design of trials for AD therapies.\n\nSummaryThe therapeutic effect of ultrasound on memory in AD mice leads to altered protein expression and improved functional connectivity in the absence of amyloid-{beta} removal.

    "abstract": "Mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis associated with resistance to antibiotics often come with a fitness cost for the bacteria. Resistance to the first-line drug rifampicin leads to lower competitive fitness of M. tuberculosis populations when compared to susceptible populations. This fitness cost, introduced by resistance mutations in the RNA polymerase, can be alleviated by compensatory mutations (CMs) in other regions of the affected protein. CMs are of particular interest clinically since they could lock in resistance mutations, encouraging the spread of resistant strains worldwide. Here, we report the statistical inference of a comprehensive set of CMs in the RNA polymerase of M. tuberculosis, using over 70,000 M. tuberculosis genomes that were collated as part of the CRyPTIC project. The unprecedented size of this data set gave the statistical tests to investigate the association of putative CMs with resistance-conferring mutations much more power. Overall, we propose 51 high-confidence CMs by means of statistical association testing and suggest hypotheses for how they exert their compensatory mechanism by mapping them onto the protein structure. In addition, we were able to show an association of CMs with higher in vitro growth densities, and hence presumably with higher fitness, in resistant samples in the more virulent M. tuberculosis Lineages 2 and 3. In Lineage 2, our results even suggest the association of CM presence with significantly higher in vitro growth than for wild-type samples, although this association is confounded with lineage and sub-lineage affiliation. Our findings emphasise the integral role of CMs and lineage affiliation in resistance spread and increases the urgency for antibiotic stewardship, which implies accurate, cheap and widely accessible diagnostics for M. tuberculosis infections to not only improve patient outcomes but also to prevent the spread of resistant strains.",

A decrease in Akkermansia muciniphila is a phenotype of obesity-induced dysbiosis. Although interventions to increase A. muciniphila are expected to improve glucose metabolism, the underlying mechanism has not been fully understood.\n\nMethodsIsoxanthohumol (IX), a prenylated flavonoid found in beer hops was administered to high fat diet-fed mice. We analyzed glucose metabolism, gene expression profiles and histology of liver, epididymal adipose tissue and colon. Lipase activity, fecal lipid profiles and plasma metabolomic analysis were assessed. Fecal 16s rRNA sequencing was obtained and selected bacterial species were used for in vitro studies. Fecal microbiota transplantation and monocolonization were conducted to antibiotic-treated or germ-free (GF) mice.\n\nResultsThe administration of IX lowered weight gain, decreased steatohepatitis and improved glucose metabolism. Mechanistically, IX inhibited pancreatic lipase activity and lipid absorption by decreasing the expression of the fatty acid transporter CD36 in the small intestine, which was confirmed by increased lipid excretion in feces. IX administration improved the gut barrier function and reduced metabolic endotoxemia. In contrast, the effects of IX were nullified by antibiotics. As revealed using 16S rRNA sequencing, the microbial community structure changed with a significant increase in the abundance of A. muciniphila in the IX-treated group. An anaerobic chamber study showed that IX selectively promoted the growth of A. muciniphila while exhibiting antimicrobial activity against some Bacteroides and Clostridium species. To further explore the direct effect of A. muciniphila on lipid and glucose metabolism, we monocolonized either A. muciniphila or Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to GF mice. A. muciniphila monocolonization decreased CD36 expression in the jejunum and improved glucose metabolism, with decreased levels of multiple classes of fatty acids determined using plasma metabolomic analysis.\n\nConclusionOur study confirmed a direct role of A. muciniphila in energy metabolism, which was induced by microbial actions of IX. These highlight new treatment strategies for preventing metabolic syndrome by boosting the gut microbiota with food components.",

Achieving sufficient statistical power for e/sQTL mapping requires large cohorts with both genotypes and molecular phenotypes, and so the genomic variation is often called from short read alignments which are unable to comprehensively resolve structural variation. Here we build a pangenome from 16 HiFi haplotype-resolved assemblies to identify small and structural variation and genotype them with PanGenie in 307 short read samples. We find high (>90%) concordance of PanGenie-genotyped and DeepVariant-called small variation, and confidently genotype close to 21M small and 43k structural variants in the larger population. We validate 85% of these structural variants (with MAF>0.1) directly with a subset of 25 short read samples that also have medium coverage HiFi reads. We then conduct e/sQTL mapping with this comprehensive variant set in a subset of 117 cattle that have testis transcriptome data and find 92 structural variants as causal candidates for eQTL and 73 for sQTL. We find that roughly half of top associated structural variants affecting expression or splicing are transposable elements, such as SV-eQTLs for STN1 and MYH7 and SV-sQTLs for CEP89 and ASAH2.

    "abstract": "The treatment of infected non-healing wounds poses a significant challenge to contemporary medicine. Essential oils (EOs) are being increasingly investigated as potential antibiofilm agents for the management of biofilm-related wound infections. However, their in vitro antimicrobial activity reported in literature does not necessarily reflect the actual in vivo activity due to, among others, methodological imperfections of performed tests. In our study, we cultivated a Staphylococcus aureus biofilm in a novel IVWM (In Vitro Wound Milieu) medium designed to simulate the wound environment and compared it with biofilms cultured in the standard microbiological Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) medium. We examined and compared critical biofilm properties such as morphology, biomass, metabolic activity, cell count, thickness, and spatial distribution of live and dead cells. Subsequently, staphylococcal biofilms and planktonic cells cultured in both media were exposed to the activity of thyme or rosemary EOs (T-EO, R-EO, respectively). We found that morphology of biofilms cultured in IVWM resembled more the morphology of biofilms visualized in the non-healing wounds than biofilms cultured in TSB. The biomass, metabolic activity, cell number, and the ratio of live to dead cells of S. aureus biofilms were all lower in IVWM compared to the TSB medium. Additionally, while EOs demonstrated overall significant anti-staphylococcal activity, their efficacy varied depending on the medium used. Generally, EOs displayed lower antimicrobial activity (against planktonic cells) in the IVWM than in the TSB medium. Interestingly, T-EO caused a higher reduction of biofilm cells in IVWM than in the TSB medium, in contrast to R-EO. Our findings suggest that EOs hold promise as agents for the treatment of biofilm-related wound infections. However, it is crucial to apply in vitro conditions that closely reflect the wound infection site to gain an accurate insight into the real-world activity of these antimicrobial/antibiofilm agents.",

    "abstract": "The gammaherpesviruses ({gamma}HVs) establish a lifelong infection in their hosts, with the cellular outcome of infection intimately regulated by target cell type. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), a small animal model of {gamma}HV infection, infects macrophages in vivo, resulting in a range of outcomes, from lytic replication to latent infection. Here, we have further investigated the nature of MHV68 macrophage infection using reductionist and primary in vivo infection studies. While MHV68 readily infected the J774 macrophage cell line, viral gene expression and replication were significantly impaired relative to a fully permissive fibroblast cell line. Lytic replication only occurred in a small subset of MHV68-infected J774 cells, despite the fact that these cells were fully competent to support lytic replication following pre-treatment with interleukin-4, a known potentiator of replication in macrophages. In parallel, we harvested virally-infected macrophages at 16 hours after MHV68 infection in vivo and analyzed gene expression by single cell RNA-sequencing. Among virally infected macrophages, only rare (0.25%) cells had lytic cycle gene expression, characterized by detection of multiple lytic cycle RNAs. In contrast, [~]50% of virally-infected macrophages were characterized by expression of ORF75A, ORF75B and/or ORF75C, in the absence of other detectable viral RNAs. Selective transcription of the ORF75 locus also occurred in MHV68-infected J774 cells. In total, these studies indicate that MHV68 efficiently infects macrophages, with the majority of cells characterized by an atypical state of restricted viral transcription, and only rare cells undergoing lytic replication.\n\nImportanceThe human gammaherpesviruses Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposis sarcoma associated herpesvirus are DNA viruses that cause lifelong infection and are associated with multiple diseases, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) is a powerful mouse model that permits close examination of these viruses. Previous studies of MHV68 identified that macrophages are an important in vivo target of infection; how infection within these cells is regulated remains incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that MHV68 infection of macrophages is characterized by two divergent outcomes across a population of infected cells: while a small subset of cells undergo lytic replication, to make new virus progeny, the majority of cells are characterized by an atypical, restricted form of infection characterized by a distinct viral gene transcription program not previously reported. These studies highlight important cell-type specific outcomes of gammaherpesvirus infection and identify a potential alternate program by which these viruses usurp macrophages.",

    "abstract": "Vision depends on the functional interplay between the photoreceptor cells of the neural retina and the supporting cells of the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Most genes involved in inherited retinal diseases (IRD) display highly specific spatiotemporal expression within these interconnected retinal components through the local recruitment of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in 3D nuclear space.\n\nTo understand the role of differential chromatin architecture in establishing tissue-specific expression patterns at IRD loci in the human neural retina and the RPE, we mapped genome-wide chromatin interactions by applying in situ Hi-C and H3K4me3 HiChIP to human adult post-mortem donor retinas. A comparative 3D genome analysis between neural retina and RPE/choroid revealed that almost 60% of 290 known IRD genes were marked by differential 3D genome structure and/or cis-regulatory interactions. One of these genes was ABCA4, which is implicated in the most common autosomal recessive IRD. We zoomed in on tissue-specific chromatin interactions at the ABCA4 locus using high-resolution UMI-4C assays. Upon integration with bulk and single-cell epigenomic datasets and in vivo enhancer assays in zebrafish, we revealed tissue-specific CREs interacting with ABCA4.\n\nIn summary, through extensive comparative 3D genome mapping, based on genome-wide (Hi-C), promoter-centric (HiChIP) and locus-specific (UMI-4C) assays of human neural retina and RPE, we have shown that gene regulation at key IRD loci is likely mediated by tissue-specific chromatin interactions. These findings do not only provide insight into tissue-specific regulatory landscapes of IRD genes, but also delineate the search space for non-coding genomic variation underlying unsolved IRD.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=75 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/543842v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fd0d7dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@180a5bforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@101aec1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1781d1d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Many transcription factors (TFs) have been shown to bind at super-enhancers, forming transcriptional condensates to activate transcription in many cellular systems. Genomic and epigenomic determinants of phase-separated transcriptional condensates are not well understood. Here we systematically analyzed DNA sequence motifs and TF binding profiles across human cell types to identify the molecular features that contribute to the formation of transcriptional condensates. We found that most DNA sequence motifs are not distributed randomly in the genome, but exhibiting spatially clustered patterns associated with super-enhancers. TF binding sites are further clustered and enriched at cell-type-specific super-enhancers. TFs exhibiting clustered binding patterns also have high liquid-liquid phase separation abilities. Compared to regular TF binding, densely clustered TF binding sites are more enriched at cell-type-specific super-enhancers with higher chromatin accessibility, higher chromatin interaction, and higher association with cancer outcome. Our results indicate that the clustered pattern of genomic binding and the phase separation properties of TFs collectively contribute to the formation of transcriptional condensates.",

    "abstract": "The economic and technical feasibility of the sequential process for valorization of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, which constitutes the mesophilic acidogenic fermentation and anaerobic digestion (AD) were studied. The results indicate that in the fermentation step, hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 4.5 days could yield higher volatile fatty acid (VFA) content of 30.5 (g-SCOD/L) as opposed to HRT of 3 days with 27.66 (g-SCOD/L). AD of residual solids out of fermentation step yielded specific methane production of [Formula]. Additionally, the effect of addition of biochar AD was investigated to conceive if it could improve the process kinetics and methane content. The results showed that feedstock/inoculum ratio of 0.3 (volatile basis) coupled with thermal and fermentative pre-treatment improved the kinetics of AD process substantially, whereas biochar addition could only improve the maximum obtainable methane content by 8 percent (76%, v/v). Furthermore, root means squared error (RMSE) obtained from the calibration in the kinetics study, showed that the first order rate model is more precise in describing the AD with biochar (6.7 vs 8.6), while the modified Gompertz is fitted better to data without biochar (9.31 vs 8.33). The economic analysis for a scale-up version with 70,000 person equivalent indicates that the proposed process could reach profit much sooner, almost 3 years in comparison to a single AD with 11 years of non-profitability. The recovery percentage of volatile solids in terms of mass was around 80%.",

    "abstract": "Childhood caries, a chronic disease affecting 60-90% of children in industrialized countries, results in lesions in primary and permanent dentition, leading to hospitalizations, emergency room visits, high treatment costs, and loss of school days. It diminishes the childs ability to learn and increases the risk of caries in adulthood. Despite multiple risk factors for caries, significant interpersonal variability unaccounted for by these factors exists. The immune system generates a personal antibody repertoire that helps maintain a balanced and healthy oral microbiome. Streptococcus mutans is a key bacterium in caries development. Utilizing mass-spectrometry, we examined which S. mutans proteins are identified by antibodies of children with and without caries and identified a core set of proteins recognizable by the immune system of most individuals. This set was enriched with proteins enabling bacterial adhesion. To study the physiological relevance of these findings, we tested the ability of saliva to prevent S. mutans adherence to tooth surfaces. Saliva from caries-free individuals, but not children with caries, was found to hinder the binding of S. mutans to teeth. These findings delineate the S. mutans proteome targeted by the immune system and suggest that the inhibition of bacterial adherence to teeth is a primary mechanism employed by the immune system to maintain oral balance and prevent caries formation. These discoveries offer fresh insights into the immune systems role in preserving oral health and preventing caries development. Targeting S. mutans proteins implicated in bacterial adhesion could be a promising strategy for preventing childhood caries.",

    "abstract": "The clinicopathological parameters such as residual tumor, grade, FIGO score are often used to predict the survival of ovarian cancer patients, but the 5-year survival of high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) still remains around 30%. In recent years, a gene expression based molecular prognostic score (mPS) was developed that showed improved prognosis in several cancers including ovarian cancer.\n\nThe feature extraction using LASSO-Cox regression was applied on the training data with 10-fold cross validation to obtain 20 predictor genes along with the coefficients to derive mPS. The mPS based prognosis of HGSOC patients was validated using the log-rank test and receiver operator characteristic curve.\n\nThe AUC of 20 gene-based mPS in predicting the 5-year overall survival was around 0.7 in both the training (n=491) and test datasets (n=491). It was also validated across HGSOC patients (n=7542), data collected from the Ovarian Tumor Tissue Analysis (OTTA) consortium. The mPS showed significant impact (adjusted HR = 6.1, 95% CI of HR= 3.65-10.3; p <0.001) on prognosis of HGSOC. The performance of mPS for the prognosis of survival of HGSOC was substantially better than conventional parameters: FIGO (adjusted HR=1.1, 95% CI=0.97-1.2, p=0.121), residual disease (adjusted HR=1.3, 95% CI= 1.13-1.4, p<0.001), and age (adjusted HR=1.2, 95% CI= 0.98-1.6, p=0.08). It was found that focal-adhesion, Wnt and Notch signaling pathways were significantly (p<0.001) upregulated, whereas antigen processing and presentation (p<0.001) was downregulated in high risk HGSOC cohorts based on mPS stratification.\n\nThe molecular prognostic score derived from 20-gene signature is found to be the novel robust prognostic marker of HGSOC. It could potentially be harnessed in clinical settings to determine the overall survival of ovarian cancer. The high risk HGSOC patients based on mPS stratification could be benefited from alternative therapies targeting Wnt/ Notch signaling pathways and also immune evasion.\n\nAuthor summaryThe 20-gene signature based molecular prognostic score (mPS) was found to be associated with risk stratification and hence, predicting the overall survival time of HGSOCs. It was applicable in all training HGSOC datasets and across RNA sequencing platforms that also includes the previous reported studies in HGSOC cohorts (Millstein et al., 2020; Talhouk et al., 2020). The 20-gene signature based mPS for the prognosis of overall survival of HGSOC outperformed conventional parameters: age, residual disease and FIGO score. The high or increased risk group of HGSOC based on our mPS stratification was found to have dysregulated pathways of Wnt, Notch, Akt signaling, and antigen presentation. Thus, treatments targeting these pathways might be beneficial for high risk HGSOC and hence anticipated to improve the over-all survival of HGSOC.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing is commonly used to evaluate microbiome profiles in health and disease and document the impact of interventional treatments. Long-read nanopore sequencing is attractive since it can provide greater classification at the species level. However, optimised protocols to target marker genes for bacterial and fungal profiling are needed. To achieve an increased taxonomic resolution, we developed extraction and long-amplicon PCR-based approaches using Nanopore sequencing. Three sample lysis conditions were applied to a mock microbial community, including known bacterial and fungal species; the 96 MagBead DNA lysis buffer (ML) alone, incorporating bead-beating (MLB) or bead-beating plus MetaPolyzyme enzymatic treatment (MLBE). Profiling of bacterial comparison, MLB had more statistically different bacterial phyla and genera than the others. For fungal profiling, MLB had a significant increase of Ascomycota and a decline of Basidiomycota, subsequently failing to detect Malassezia and Cryptococcus. Also, the principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plot by the Bray-Curtis index showed a significant difference among groups for bacterial (p = 0.033) and fungal (p = 0.012) profiles. Overall, the microbial profiling and diversity analysis revealed that ML and MLBE have more similarity than MLB for both bacteria and fungi, therefore, bead-beating is not recommended for long-read amplicon sequencing. However, ML alone was suggested as an optimal approach considering DNA yield, classification, reagent cost and hands-on time. This could be an initial proof-of-concept study for simultaneous human microbiome and mycobiome studies.",

    "abstract": "During infection, bacteriophages produce diverse gene products to overcome bacterial anti-phage defenses, to outcompete other phages, and take over cellular processes. Even in the best-studied model phages, the roles of most phage-encoded gene products are unknown, and the phage population represents a largely untapped reservoir of novel gene functions. Considering the sheer size of this population, experimental screening methods are needed to sort through the enormous collection of available sequences and identify gene products that can modulate bacterial behavior for downstream functional characterization. Here, we describe the construction of a plasmid-based overexpression library of 94 genes encoded by Hammy, a Cluster K mycobacteriophage closely related to those infecting clinically important mycobacteria. The arrayed library was systematically screened in a plate-based cytotoxicity assay, identifying a diverse set of 24 gene products (representing 25% of the Hammy genome) capable of inhibiting growth of the host bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis. Half of these are related to growth inhibitors previously identified in related phage Waterfoul, supporting their functional conservation; the other genes represent novel additions to the list of known anti-mycobacterial growth inhibitors. This work, conducted as part of the HHMI-supported Science Education Alliance Gene-function Elucidation by a Network of Emerging Scientists (SEA-GENES) project, highlights the value of parallel, comprehensive overexpression screens in exploring genome-wide patterns of phage gene function and novel interactions between phages and their hosts.",

After their assembly, nucleocapsids are translocated to the cytoplasm for final virion maturation. Nascent cytoplasmic nucleocapsids are prevented from binding to NPCs and delivering their genomes to the nucleus from which they emerged, but how this is accomplished is not understood. Here we report that HSV pUL16 and pUL21 deletion mutants accumulate empty capsids at the cytoplasmic face of NPCs late in infection. Additionally, prior expression of pUL16 and pUL21 prevented incoming nucleocapsids from docking at NPCs, delivering their genomes to the nucleus and initiating viral gene expression. Both pUL16 and pUL21 localized to the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear envelope, placing them in an appropriate location to interfere with nucleocapsid/NPC interactions.",

While there are extensive studies that document these efforts, there are several gaps in knowledge that could benefit from the creation of new research tools. First, we now appreciate that while TcdA sequences are conserved, TcdB sequences can vary across the span of circulating clinical isolates. An understanding of the TcdA and TcdB epitopes that drive broadly neutralizing antibody responses could advance the effort to identify safe and effective toxin-protein chimeras and fragments for vaccine development. Further, an understanding of TcdA and TcdB concentration changes in vivo can guide research into how host and microbiome-focused interventions affect the virulence potential of C. difficile. We have developed a panel of alpaca-derived nanobodies that bind specific structural and functional domains of TcdA and TcdB. We note that many of the potent neutralizers of TcdA bind epitopes within the delivery domain, a finding that could reflect roles of the delivery domain in receptor binding and/or the conserved role of pore-formation in the delivery of the toxin enzyme domains to the cytosol. In contrast, neutralizing epitopes for TcdB were found in multiple domains. The nanobodies were also used for the creation of sandwich ELISA assays that allow for quantitation of TcdA and/or TcdB in vitro and in the cecal and fecal contents of infected mice. We anticipate these reagents and assays will allow researchers to monitor the dynamics of TcdA and TcdB production over time, and the impact of various experimental interventions on toxin production in vivo.\n\nAuthor SummaryC. difficile (C. diff) is a leading cause of diarrhea and is recognized as an urgent threat by the Centers for Disease Control. Disease symptoms are caused by two large, similar, protein toxins, TcdA and TcdB. These toxins are drug targets and are also important for diagnosis. Despite their clear importance, the understanding of how to neutralize toxin activity is incomplete, and there are no freely available tools to quantify toxin concentration in research studies. To address these issues, we have developed nanobodies that bind and neutralize TcdA and TcdB and have also used these nanobodies to develop quantitative assays for TcdA and TcdB detection. Neutralization studies led us to discover that many of the potent neutralizers of TcdA bind epitopes within the delivery domain. This finding suggests either a role for the delivery domain in receptor binding or that the nanobodies block pore-formation and thereby inhibit delivery of the toxin enzyme domains to the cytosol. The availability of nanobody assays that can differentiate the quantities of TcdA from TcdB should permit a better understanding of toxin-specific effects and how toxin levels change over the course of infection.",

    "abstract": "Cholesterol dependent cytolysins (CDCs) are a large family of pore forming toxins, produced by numerous gram-positive pathogens. CDCs depend on host membrane cholesterol for pore formation; some CDCs also require surface associated human CD59 (hCD59) for binding, conferring specificity for human cells. We purified a recombinant version of a putative CDC encoded in the genome of Streptococcus oralis subsp. tigurinus, tigurilysin (TGY), and used CRISPR/Cas9 to construct hCD59 knockout (KO) HeLa and JEG-3 cell lines. Cell viability assays with TGY on WT and hCD59 KO cells showed that TGY is a hCD59-dependent CDC. Two variants of TGY exist among S. oralis subsp. tigurinus genomes, only one of which is functional. We discovered that a single amino acid change between these two TGY variants determines its activity. Flow cytometry and oligomerization western blots revealed that the single amino acid difference between the two TGY isoforms disrupts host cell binding and oligomerization. Furthermore, experiments with hCD59 KO cells and cholesterol depleted cells demonstrated that TGY is fully dependent on both hCD59 and cholesterol for activity, unlike other known hCD59-dependent CDCs. Using full-length CDCs and toxin constructs differing only in the binding domain, we determined that having hCD59-dependence leads to increased lysis efficiency, conferring a potential advantage to organisms producing hCD59-dependent CDCs.\n\nIMPORTANCECholesterol dependent cytolysins (CDCs) are produced by a variety of disease-causing bacteria, and may play a significant role in pathogenesis. Understanding CDC mechanisms of action provides useful information for developing anti-virulence strategies against bacteria that utilize CDCs and other pore-forming toxins in pathogenesis. This study describes for the first time a novel human-specific CDC with an atypical pore forming mechanism compared to known CDCs. In addition, this study demonstrates that human-specificity potentially confers increased lytic efficiency to CDCs. These data provide a possible explanation for the selective advantage of developing hCD59-dependency in CDCs and the consequent host restriction.",

    "abstract": "In this systematic review we have sought to summarise the current knowledge concerning biomarkers that can distinguish between steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome and steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. Additionally, we aim to select biomarkers that have the best evidence-base and should be prioritised for further research.\n\nPub med and web of science databases were searched using \"steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome AND biomarker\". Papers published between 01/01/2012 and 10/05/2022 were included. Papers that did not compare steroid resistant and steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome, did not report sensitivity/specificity or area under curve and reviews/letters were excluded. The selected papers were then assessed for bias using the QUADAS-2 tool. The source of the biomarker, cut off, sensitivity/specificity, area under curve and sample size were all extracted. Quality assessment was performed using the BIOCROSS tool.\n\n17 studies were included, comprising 15 case-control studies and 2 cross-sectional studies. Given the rarity of nephrotic syndrome and difficulty in recruiting large cohorts, case-control studies were accepted despite their limitations.\n\nHaptoglobin and suPAR were identified as the most promising biomarkers based on their ability to predict rather than assess steroid resistance in nephrotic syndrome, their respective sample sizes and specificity and sensitivity.\n\nNone of the selected papers stated whether the authors were blinded to the patients disease when assessing the index test in the cohort.\n\nThese candidate biomarkers must now be tested with much larger sample sizes. Using new biobanks such as the one built by the NURTuRE-INS team will be very helpful in this regard.",

    "abstract": "1.Waprin, first discovered in snake venom, is an extracellular secretory protein known for its antibacterial activity. Analysis of sex-specific transcriptomes of adult Tribolium castaneum led to the identification of a female-specific Waprin protein gene (Tc_WapF) which expresses only in female adults. Knockdown of Tc_WapF didnt show any effect in the same generation, but the eggs laid by Tc_WapF knockdown females failed to develop/hatch. No expression of Tc_WapF was detected in Tribolium embryos, hence considering the antibacterial properties of Waprin proteins and the failure of hatching of eggs laid by Tc_WapF knockdown females, we assume the involvement of Tc_WapF in protecting the embryos from the environmental pathogens. Tc_WapF is not regulated by sex determination pathway of T. castaneum as the expression of Tc_WapF was not changed upon the knockdown of sex determination pathway genes of T. castaneum. Further, we also identified two more waprin genes of T. castaneum expressing in a non-sex specific manner at all the developmental stages. To the best of our knowledge this study is the first attempt to characterize the developmental role of waprin genes in any insect. The study presented here provides an opportunity to probe the potential of Tribolium Waprin proteins as non-conventional antimicrobials.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, quality control of mRNA represents an important regulatory mechanism for gene expression. Misprocessed mRNAs that contain an intact 5 Splice Site (5SS) motif are retained in the nucleus and targeted for decay. Previously, we showed that the nuclear retention of these transcripts requires ZFC3H1, a component of the Poly(A) Exosome Targeting (PAXT) complex, and U1-70K, a component of the U1 snRNP. In S. pombe, the ZFC3H1 homolog, Red1, binds to the YTH-domain containing protein Mmi1 to target certain RNA transcripts for nuclear retention and decay. Here we show that ZFC3H1 and U1-70K interact with YTHDC1 and YTHDC2, two YTH domain-containing proteins that bind to N-6-methyladenosine (m6A) modified RNAs. We then show that YTHDC1 and YTHDC2 are required for the nuclear retention of mRNAs with intact 5SS motifs. Furthermore, disruption of m6A methyltransferase activity inhibits the nuclear retention of these transcripts. Using m6A-miCLIP analysis, we map m6A methylation marks to intronic polyadenylated (IPA) transcripts, which contain intact 5SS motifs and are nuclear retained and degraded in a ZFC3H1-dependent manner. We find that m6A is enriched near intact 5SS motifs and the poly(A)-tail. Overall, this work suggests that the m6A modification acts as part of an evolutionarily conserved quality control mechanism that targets misprocessed mRNAs for nuclear retention and decay.",
