    "abstract": "Binary phase separation with conserved order parameters is a generic thermodynamic process that arises in different contexts. One system of great fundamental and practical interest is the condensation of bio-molecules, where the order parameters are concentrations of solutes, and the condensed phase typically contains many different components of diverse properties. In such systems, each solute species corresponds to one dimension in the full phase space and a major challenge in the field is to rigorously interpret and quantify the multi-component character of any given phase separation system. Here, we formulate a dominance parameter D for each solute  in a multi-component system, and show that it is easily accessible in experiments and relates to the underlying thermodynamics and the phase space. We complement the theoretical work with experimental data, and demonstrate that D reflects the interactions driving phase separation. A simple computational model further illuminates the variation of D across the whole phase space. This work paves the way for future quantitative investigations into multi-component systems.",

    "abstract": "Micron-scale electron transfer through polymeric cytochrome  nanowires powers prokaryotic life from hydrothermal vents to terrestrial soils in ways not fully understood. How much structural diversity optimizes electrical conductivity for survival in these different habitats is challenging to assess experimentally. Herein, physiologically relevant redox conduction is computationally assessed in cytochrome filaments from Geobacter sulfurreducens (OmcE, OmcS, and OmcZ), Pyrobaculum calidifontis (A3MW92), and Archaeoglobus veneficus (F2KMU8). A newly implemented Python program, BioDC, is used and validated against redox currents predicted from considerably more expensive molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations. BioDC uses the heme solvent accessibility, stacking geometry, and redox-linked change in electrostatic energy to estimate electron transfer energetics. Leveraging this efficiency, structurally diverse cytochrome  nanowires from different organisms are shown to have similar redox conductivities. A functionally robust heme chain  packaged in habitat-customized proteins is proposed to be a general evolutionary design principle for cytochrome  nanowires widely distributed among prokaryotes.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/544705v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (60K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ac61d9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14c2e87org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@82d60corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b2cbd6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging studies have suggested an important role for the default mode network (DMN) in disorders of consciousness (DoC). However, the extent to which DMN connectivity can discriminate DoC states - unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS) - is less evident. Particularly, it is unclear whether effective DMN connectivity, as measured indirectly with dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of resting EEG can disentangle UWS from healthy controls and from patients considered conscious (MCS+). Crucially, this extends to UWS patients with potentially \"covert\" awareness (minimally conscious star, MCS*) indexed by voluntary brain activity in conjunction with partially preserved frontoparietal metabolism as measured with positron emission tomography (PET+ diagnosis; in contrast to PET-diagnosis with complete frontoparietal hypometabolism). Here, we address this gap by using DCM of EEG data acquired from patients with traumatic brain injury in 11 UWS (6 PET- and 5 PET+) and in 12 MCS+ (11 PET+ and 1 PET-), alongside with 11 healthy controls. We provide evidence for a key difference in left frontoparietal connectivity when contrasting UWS PET- with MCS+ patients and healthy controls. Next, in a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, we tested the classification performance of the DCM models demonstrating that connectivity between medial prefrontal and left parietal sources reliably discriminates UWS PET- from MCS+ patients and controls. Finally, we illustrate that these models generalize to an unseen dataset: models trained to discriminate UWS PET- from MCS+ and controls, classify MCS* patients as conscious subjects with high posterior probability (pp > .92). These results identify specific alterations in the DMN after severe brain injury and highlight the clinical utility of EEG- based effective connectivity for identifying patients with potential covert awareness.\n\nAuthor SummaryOur study investigates the role of the Default Mode Network (DMN) in individuals with disorders of consciousness (DoC), such as unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS). Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested a role for the DMN in DoC, but its ability to differentiate between UWS and MCS remain unclear.\n\nUsing advance brain imaging and modelling techniques, we analyzed data from DoC patients with traumatic brain injury and healthy controls. Our findings reveal a key difference in left frontoparietal connectivity when comparing UWS to MCS patients and healthy individuals.\n\nTo validate our results, we employed a robust cross-validation approach, which demonstrated that the connectivity between frontal and left parietal brain regions reliably discriminates UWS patients from MCS patients and controls. Furthermore, we extended our analysis to include patients with potential covert awareness, showcasing the clinical utility of our findings. We successfully classified these patients as conscious with high accuracy.\n\nThis research significantly contributes to our understanding of the DMN in DoC and highlights the potential use of electroencephalography-based connectivity analysis in clinical settings. By identifying specific alterations in the DMN after severe brain injury, our study may aid in the accurate diagnosis and management of individuals with disorders of consciousness, potentially improving their overall outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Norepinephrine (NE), a neuromodulator released by locus coeruleus neurons throughout cortex, influences arousal and learning through extra-synaptic vesicle exocytosis. While NE within cortical regions has been viewed as a homogenous field, recent studies have demonstrated heterogeneous axonal dynamics and advances in GPCR-based fluorescent sensors permit direct observation of the local dynamics of NE at cellular scale. To investigate how the spatiotemporal dynamics of NE release in the PFC affect neuronal firing, we employed in-vivo two-photon imaging of layer 2/3 of PFC in order to observe fine-scale neuronal calcium and NE dynamics concurrently. We found that local and global NE fields can decouple from one another, providing a substrate for local NE spatiotemporal activity patterns. Optic flow analysis revealed putative release and reuptake events which can occur at the same location, albeit at different times, indicating the potential to create a heterogeneous NE field. Utilizing generalized linear models, we demonstrated that cellular Ca2+ fluctuations are influenced by both the local and global NE field. However, during periods of local/global NE field decoupling, the local field drives cell firing dynamics rather than the global field. These findings underscore the significance of localized, phasic NE fluctuations for structuring cell firing, which may provide local neuromodulatory control of cortical activity.",

    "abstract": "Aim: to estimate European megafauna diversity and functional declines in the present compared to the nearest in time modern-analogue climate period prior to the worldwide diffusion of Homo sapiens.\n\nLocation: Europe.\n\nTime period: Last Interglacial (LIG; ca. 127,000 years ago) to present.\n\nMajor taxa studied: wild, large ([&ge;]10 kg) terrestrial mammals.\n\nMethods: we assessed the distribution of 48 European megafauna species during the LIG using hindcasting modelling and fossil records. Then, we estimated the decline in megafauna community diversity and potential trait-based functional effects from the LIG to the present, accounting for climate differences between the two periods.\n\nResults: from the LIG to the present, species richness and community biomass across Europe dropped by 74.3% ({+/-} 9.9% SD) and 96.7% ({+/-} 4.1% SD), respectively. Functional diversity dropped by 59.1% ({+/-} 11.8% SD) for herbivores and by 48.2% ({+/-} 25.0% SD) for carnivores, while trait-informed potential vegetation and meat consumptions dropped by 91.1% ({+/-} 7.4% SD) and 61.2% ({+/-} 17.2% SD), respectively. The loss in megafauna diversity and associated ecological processes were high everywhere, but particularly in western Europe for carnivores and in the East European Plain for herbivores. We found that potential megafauna richness and functional patterns in the two periods were near identical if only climate-driven differences were considered.\n\nMain conclusions: severe, size-biased defaunation has degraded megafauna assemblages and megafauna-mediated ecological processes across Europe from the LIG to the present. These patterns cannot be explained by climate differences between the two periods, thus were likely driven by the impact of prehistoric Homo sapiens. The results suggest that the structure of wild ecosystems of the present strongly deviates from the evolutionary norm, notably with decreased functional heterogeneity and decreased fluxes of biogeochemical compounds across the trophic networks, highlighting the importance of ambitious policies of megafauna community restoration to support ecosystems functioning.",

    "abstract": "Seedling recruitment is a critical life history stage that is likely driven by the interplay of seed and microsite limitation and their interaction with seed traits. Here, we performed a factorial experiment involving seed addition and surface soil disturbance to explore the combined effects of seed and site availability using genotypes characterized by varying seed mass and dormancy traits. Additionally, we included hybrids that exhibited recombined seed trait relationships compared to natural genotypes, allowing us to assess the impact of specific seed traits on establishment across different sites. We detected a significant three-way interaction between seed addition, site conditions, and soil surface disturbance, influencing both seedling and adult recruitment in Panicum hallii, a perennial grass found in coastal mesic (lowland) and inland xeric (upland) habitats. This recruitment pattern suggests that lowland and upland establishment at foreign site is constrained by the interplay of seed and site limitations. Notably, soil surface disturbance facilitated recruitment of the upland genotype while constraining recruitment of the lowland genotype across all sites. Our results highlight the importance of seed size and dormancy as key factors impacting recruitment, suggesting a potential interactive relationship between these traits.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer subtyping is a difficult clinical and scientific challenge. The prevalent Prediction Analysis of Microarray of 50 genes (PAM50) system and its Immunohistochemistry (IHC) surrogate showed significant inconsistencies. This is because of the limited training samples, highly variable molecular features and in-efficient strategies used in these classifiers. The rapid development of early screening technologies, especially in the field of circulating tumor DNA, has also challenged the subtyping of breast cancer at the DNA level. By integrating large-scale DNA-level data and using a hierarchical structure learning algorithm, we developed Unified Genetic and Epigenetic Subtyping (UGES), a new intrinsic subtype classifier. The benchmarks showed that the use of all classes of DNA alterations worked much better than single classes, and that the multi-step hierarchical learning is crucial, which improves the overall AUC score by 0.074 compared to the one-step multi-classification method. Based on these insights, the ultimate UGES was trained as a three-step classifier on 50831 DNA features of 2065 samples, including mutations, copy number aberrations, and methylations. UGES achieved overall AUC score 0.963, and greatly improved the clinical stratification of patients, as each stratas survival difference became statistically more significant p-value=9.7e-55 (UGES) vs 2.2e-47 (PAM50). Finally, UGES identified 52 subtype-level DNA biomarkers that can be targeted in early screening technology to significantly expand the time window for precision care.

    "abstract": "In numerous subtypes of central and peripheral neurons, small and intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK and IK, respectively) channels are important regulators of neuronal excitability. Transcripts encoding SK channel subunits, as well as the closely related IK subunit, are co-expressed in the soma of colonic afferent neurons with receptors for the algogenic mediators adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and bradykinin, P2X3 and B2, highlighting the potential utility of these channels as drug targets for the treatment of abdominal pain in gastrointestinal diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome. Despite this, pre-treatment with the dual SK/IK channel opener SKA-31 had no effect on the colonic afferent response to ATP, bradykinin or noxious ramp distention of the colon. Inhibition of SK or IK channels with apamin or TRAM-34, respectively, yielded no change in spontaneous baseline afferent activity, indicating these channels are not tonically active. In contrast to its lack of effect in electrophysiological experiments, comparable concentrations of SKA-31 abolished ongoing peristaltic activity in the colon ex vivo. Treatment with the KV7 channel opener retigabine blunted the colonic afferent response to all applied stimuli. Our data therefore highlight the potential utility of KV7, but not SK/IK, channel openers as analgesic agents for the treatment of abdominal pain.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is a pervasive health, social, and economic problem affecting 1 in 5 individuals around the world. Increasingly, it is understood that alterations in fundamental cell biological processes are critical for chronic pain. A prominent cellular process is autophagy but whether it plays a role in pain is unknown. To investigate whether autophagy is involved in pain processing and is targetable for pain relief, we focused on Beclin 1, a component of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex necessary for initiating autophagy. Here, we found that inflammatory pain hypersensitivity in male mice lacking one allele of Becn1 is significantly greater than that in wild type mice. By contrast, in female mice, loss of Becn1 did not affect inflammation-induced pain hypersensitivity. Further, intrathecal delivery of an activator of Beclin 1, tat-beclin 1, reversed mechanical hypersensitivity induced by peripheral inflammation or peripheral nerve injury in males. Tat-beclin 1 also prevented mechanical hypersensitivity induced by exogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a core mediator of inflammatory and neuropathic pain in the spinal dorsal horn in males. Pain signaling pathways converge on enhancement of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in spinal dorsal horn neurons. We found that loss of Beclin 1 increases expression of the pain-critical NMDAR subunit, GluN2B, in the dorsal horn and upregulates synaptic NMDAR-mediated currents in dorsal horn neurons from males but not females. From our converging lines of evidence, we conclude that inhibition of Beclin 1 in the dorsal horn is critical in mediating inflammatory and neuropathic pain signaling pathways in males. Our findings provide the basis for sex-specific therapeutic approaches targeting pain with a new class of analgesics - activators of Beclin 1.",

    "abstract": "Integrative taxonomy combining data from multiple axes of biologically relevant variation is a major recent goal of systematics. Ideally, such taxonomies would be backed by similarly integrative species-delimitation analyses. Yet, most current methods rely solely or primarily on molecular data, with other layers often incorporated only in a post hoc qualitative or comparative manner. A major limitation is the difficulty of deriving and implementing quantitative parametric models linking different datasets in a unified ecological and evolutionary framework. Machine Learning methods offer flexibility in this arena by learning high-dimensional associations between observations (e.g., individual specimens) across a wide array of input features (e.g., genetics, geography, environment, and phenotype) to delineate statistical clusters. Here, I implement an unsupervised method using Self-Organizing (or \"Kohonen\") Maps (SOMs). Recent extensions called SuperSOMs can integrate an arbitrary number of layers, each of which exerts independent influence on the two-dimensional output clustering via empirically estimated weights. These output clusters can then be delimited into K significant units that are interpreted as species or other entities. I show an empirical example in Desmognathus salamanders with layers representing alleles, space, climate, and traits. Simulations reveal that the SOM/SuperSOM approach can detect K=1, does not over-split, reflects contributions from all layers with signal, and does not allow layer size (e.g., large genetic matrices) to overwhelm other datasets, desirable properties addressing major concerns from previous methods. Finally, I suggest that these and similar methods could integrate conservation-relevant layers such as population trends and human encroachment to delimit management units from an explicitly quantitative framework grounded in the ecology and evolution of species limits and boundaries.",

    "abstract": "The evaluation of plant and animal growth, separately for genetic and environmental effects, is necessary for genetic understanding and genetic improvement of environmental responses of plants and animals. We propose an original approach that combines nonlinear mixed-effects model (NLME) and the stochastic approximation of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm (SAEM) to analyze genetic and environmental effects on plant growth. These tools are widely used in many fields but very rarely in plant biology. During model formulation, a nonlinear mechanistic function describes the shape of growth, and random effects describe genetic and environmental effects and their variability. Genetic relationships among the varieties were also integrated into the model using a kinship matrix. The SAEM algorithm was chosen as an efficient alternative to MCMC methods, which are more commonly used in the domain. It was implemented to infer the expected growth patterns in the analyzed population and the expected curves for each variety through a maximum-likelihood and a maximum-a-posteriori approaches, respectively. The obtained estimates can be used to predict the growth curves for each variety. We illustrate the strengths of the proposed approach using simulated data and soybean plant growth data obtained from a soybean cultivation experiment conducted at the Arid Land Research Center, Tottori University. In this experiment, plant height was measured daily using drones, and the growth was monitored for approximately 200 soybean cultivars for which whole-genome sequence data were available. The NLME approach improved our understanding of the determinants of soybean growth and can be successfully used for the genomic prediction of growth pattern characteristics.\n\nAuthor summaryNonlinear mechanistic models are useful for modeling animal and plant growth; however, their parameters are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. If the same model can be applied to data with different genetic and environmental factors by allowing parameter variations, it can be used to understand, predict, and control the genetic and environmental influences of growth models based on parameter variation. In this study, we propose a statistical method for integrating a nonlinear mixed-effects model with a nonlinear mechanistic model. The simulation and real data analysis results show that the proposed method was effective in modeling the growth of genetically different soybean varieties under different drought conditions. The usefulness of the proposed method is expected to increase, as high-throughput measurements provide growth data for a large number of genotypes in various environments.",

    "abstract": "The Ras/PI3K/ERK signaling network is frequently mutated in various human cancers including cervical cancer and pancreatic cancer. Previous studies showed that the Ras/PI3K/ERK signaling network displays features of excitable systems including propagation of activity waves, all-or-none responses, and refractoriness. Oncogenic mutations lead to enhanced excitability of the network. A positive feedback loop between Ras, PI3K, the cytoskeleton, and FAK was identified as a driver of excitability. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of targeting signaling excitability by inhibiting both FAK and PI3K in cervical and pancreatic cancer cells. We found that the combination of FAK and PI3K inhibitors synergistically suppressed the growth of select cervical and pancreatic cancer cell lines through increased apoptosis and decreased mitosis. In particular, FAK inhibition caused downregulation of PI3K and ERK signaling in cervical cancer but not pancreatic cancer cells. Interestingly, PI3K inhibitors activated multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including insulin receptor and IGF-1R in cervical cancer cells, as well as EGFR, Her2, Her3, Axl, and EphA2 in pancreatic cancer cells. Our results highlight the potential of combining FAK and PI3K inhibition for treating cervical and pancreatic cancer, although appropriate biomarkers for drug sensitivity are needed, and concurrent targeting of RTKs may be required for resistant cells.",

    "abstract": "Substantial changes in behavior, physiology, and brain function occur when alertness decreases 1- 5. These changes in brain function involve increased synchronization between cortical areas 6,7 as well as alterations in sensory processing pathways and networks connecting the thalamus and cortex 5,8-11. Cognitive tasks engage overlapping functional networks with sensory pathways facilitating information processing 12,13, and thalamocortical and corticocortical networks supporting task performance 14,15. Frontoparietal circuits play a crucial role in cognitive tasks 16 and states of decreased consciousness 17. To develop an integrated framework of consciousness and cognition, it is important to understand how fluctuations in alertness and cognitive processing interact in these shared circuits 18. Our hypothesis is that during periods of low alertness, individuals who actively maintain task engagement would recruit additional frontoparietal and sensory processing networks, while thalamocortical dynamics that typically change during sleep onset would remain unaffected. Our findings demonstrated that as alertness decreased, passively listening to auditory tones led to increased synchronization in the parietal lobe, whereas actively performing an auditory task resulted in increased long-range frontoparietal synchronization. During decreasing alertness, passive listening (but not active task engagement) was associated with widespread increased synchronization between the thalamus and cortex. In contrast, active task engagement (but not passive listening) led to increased synchronization between the auditory cortex and the rest of the brain. These results reveal the functional mechanisms of the brains flexible reorganization during transitions of consciousness when individuals are actively engaged in cognitive processes.",

    "abstract": "Ketamines role in providing a rapid and sustained antidepressant response, particularly for patients unresponsive to conventional treatments, is increasingly recognized. A core symptom of depression, anhedonia, or the loss of enjoyment or interest in previously pleasurable activities, is known to be significantly alleviated by ketamine. While several hypotheses have been proposed regarding the mechanisms by which ketamine alleviates anhedonia, the specific circuits and synaptic changes responsible for its sustained therapeutic effects are not yet understood. Here, we show that the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a major hub of the reward circuitry, is essential for ketamines effect in rescuing anhedonia in mice subjected to chronic stress, a critical risk factor in the genesis of depression in humans. Specifically, a single exposure to ketamine rescues stress-induced decreased strength of excitatory synapses on NAc D1 dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs). By using a novel cell-specific pharmacology method, we demonstrate that this cell-type specific neuroadaptation is necessary for the sustained therapeutic effects of ketamine. To test for causal sufficiency, we artificially mimicked ketamine-induced increase in excitatory strength on D1-MSNs and found that this recapitulates the behavioral amelioration induced by ketamine. Finally, to determine the presynaptic origin of the relevant glutamatergic inputs for ketamine-elicited synaptic and behavioral effects, we used a combination of opto- and chemogenetics. We found that ketamine rescues stress-induced reduction in excitatory strength at medial prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus inputs to NAc D1-MSNs. Chemogenetically preventing ketamine-evoked plasticity at those unique inputs to the NAc reveals a ketamine-operated input-specific control of hedonic behavior. These results establish that ketamine rescues stress-induced anhedonia via cell-type-specific adaptations as well as information integration in the NAc via discrete excitatory synapses.",

    "abstract": "Reduced genome bacteria are genetically simplified systems that facilitate biological study and industrial use. The free-living Alphaproteobacterium, Zymomonas mobilis, has a naturally reduced genome containing fewer than 2000 protein coding genes. Despite its small genome, Z. mobilis thrives in diverse conditions including the presence or absence of atmospheric oxygen. However, insufficient characterization of essential and conditionally essential genes has limited broader adoption of Z. mobilis as a model Alphaproteobacterium. Here, we use genome-scale CRISPRi-seq to systematically identify and characterize Z. mobilis genes that are conditionally essential for aerotolerant or anaerobic growth, or are generally essential across both conditions. Comparative genomics revealed that the essentiality of most \"generally essential\" genes was shared between Z. mobilis and other Alphaproteobacteria, validating Z. mobilis as reduced genome model. Among conditionally essential genes, we found that the DNA repair gene, recJ, was critical only for aerobic growth but reduced the mutation rate under both conditions. Further, we show that genes encoding the F1FO ATP synthase and Rnf respiratory complex are required for anaerobic growth of Z. mobilis. Combining CRISPRi partial knockdowns with metabolomics and membrane potential measurements, we determined that the ATP synthase generates membrane potential that is consumed by Rnf to power downstream processes. Rnf knockdown strains accumulated isoprenoid biosynthesis intermediates, suggesting a key role for Rnf in powering essential biosynthetic reactions. Our work establishes Z. mobilis as a streamlined model for alphaproteobacterial genetics, has broad implications in bacterial energy coupling, and informs Z. mobilis genome manipulation for optimized production of valuable isoprenoid-based bioproducts.\n\nImportanceThe inherent complexity of biological systems is a major barrier to our understanding of cellular physiology. Bacteria with markedly fewer genes than their close relatives, or reduced genome bacteria, are promising biological models with less complexity. Reduced genome bacteria can also have superior properties for industrial use, provided the reduction does not overly restrict strain robustness. Naturally reduced genome bacteria, such as the Alphaproteobacterium, Zymomonas mobilis, have fewer genes but remain environmentally robust. In this study, we show that Z. mobilis is a simplified genetic model for Alphaproteobacteria, a class with important impacts on the environment, human health, and industry. We also identify genes that are only required in the absence of atmospheric oxygen, uncovering players that maintain and utilize the cellular energy state. Our findings have broad implications for the genetics of Alphaproteobacteria and industrial use of Z. mobilis to create biofuels and bioproducts.",

    "abstract": "Over 290 million people are infected by schistosomes worldwide. Schistosomiasis control efforts focus on mass drug treatment with praziquantel (PZQ), a drug that kills the adult worm of all Schistosoma species. Nonetheless, re-infections have continued to be detected in endemic areas with individuals living in the same area presenting with varying infection intensities. Our objective was to characterize the transcriptome profiles in peripheral blood of children between 10 - 15 years with varying intensities of Schistosoma mansoni infection living along the Albert Nile in Uganda. RNA extracted from peripheral blood collected from 44 S. mansoni infected (34 high and 10 low by circulating anodic antigen [CAA] level) and 20 uninfected children was sequenced using Illumina NovaSeq S4 and the reads aligned to the GRCh38 human genome. Differential gene expression analysis was done using DESeq2 and enriched pathways in differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using REACTOME. Principal component analysis revealed clustering of gene expression by gender when S. mansoni infected children were compared with uninfected children. In addition, we identified 14 DEGs between S. mansoni infected and uninfected individuals, 56 DEGs between children with high infection intensity and uninfected individuals, 33 DEGs between those with high infection intensity and low infection intensity and no DEGs between those with low infection and uninfected individuals. We also observed upregulation and downregulation of some DEGs that are associated with fibrosis and its regulation. These data suggest expression of fibrosis associated genes as well as genes that regulate fibrosis in S. mansoni infection. The relatively few significant DEGS observed in children with schistosomiasis suggests that chronic S. mansoni infection is a stealth infection that does not stimulate a strong immune response.\n\nAuthor SummarySchistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease transmitted via an intermediate snail host through contact with contaminated fresh water. Even with routine Mass Drug Administration for treatment of the infection, re-infections are still common and variations in infection intensity and pathology are still observed in individuals in the same location. These may be due to differences in individuals response to S. mansoni infection. In this study, we used RNAseq to identify differentially expressed genes associated with S. mansoni infection in children between 10-15 years. We conducted comparisons between phenotypes including infection intensities measured by circulating anodic antigen, wasting by body mass index and stunting by height-for-age z score. Our data showed very low numbers of significant differentially expressed genes in all comparisons. Some of the few differentially expressed genes that were observed were associated with fibrosis which is the cause of pathology in humans and has been observed in late stages of S. mansoni infection in murine studies.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine and orexins (hypocretins) play important roles in regulating reward-seeking behaviors. It is known that hypothalamic orexinergic neurons project to dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), where they can stimulate dopaminergic neuronal activity. Although there are reciprocal connections between dopaminergic and orexinergic systems, whether and how dopamine regulates the activity of orexin neurons is currently not known. Here we implemented an opto-Pavlovian task in which mice learn to associate a sensory cue with optogenetic dopamine neuron stimulation to investigate the relationship between dopamine release and orexin neuron activity in the LH. We found that dopamine release can be evoked in LH upon optogenetic stimulation of VTA dopamine neurons, and is also naturally evoked by cue presentation after opto-Pavlovian learning. Furthermore, orexin neuron activity could also be upregulated by local stimulation of dopaminergic terminals in the LH in a way that is partially dependent on dopamine D2 receptors (DRD2).

    "abstract": "There is a pressing need to improve the translational validity of Alzheimers disease (AD) mouse models. Introducing genetic background diversity in AD mouse models has been proposed as a way to increase validity and enable discovery of previously uncharacterized genetic contributions to AD susceptibility or resilience. However, the extent to which genetic background influences the mouse brain proteome and its perturbation in AD mouse models is unknown. Here we crossed the 5XFAD AD mouse model on a C57BL/6J (B6) inbred background with the DBA/2J (D2) inbred background and analyzed the effects of genetic background variation on the brain proteome in F1 progeny. Both genetic background and 5XFAD transgene insertion strongly affected protein variance in hippocampus and cortex (n=3,368 proteins). Protein co-expression network analysis identified 16 modules of highly co-expressed proteins common across hippocampus and cortex in 5XFAD and non-transgenic mice. Among the modules strongly influenced by genetic background were those related to small molecule metabolism and ion transport. Modules strongly influenced by the 5XFAD transgene were related to lysosome/stress response and neuronal synapse/signaling. The modules with the strongest relationship to human disease--neuronal synapse/signaling and lysosome/stress response--were not significantly influenced by genetic background. However, other modules in 5XFAD that were related to human disease, such as GABA synaptic signaling and mitochondrial membrane modules, were influenced by genetic background. Most disease-related modules were more strongly correlated to AD genotype in hippocampus compared to cortex. Our findings suggest that genetic diversity introduced by crossing B6 and D2 inbred backgrounds influences proteomic changes related to disease in the 5XFAD model, and that proteomic analysis of other genetic backgrounds in transgenic and knock-in AD mouse models is warranted to capture the full range of molecular heterogeneity in genetically diverse models of AD.",

    "abstract": "In 2020, stay-at-home orders were implemented to stem the spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. Social isolation can be particularly harmful to children and adolescents--during the pandemic, the prevalence of obesity increased by [~]37% in persons aged 2-19. Obesity is often comorbid with type 2 diabetes, which was not assessed in this human pandemic cohort. Here, we investigated whether male mice isolated throughout adolescence develop type 2 diabetes in a manner consistent with human obesity-induced diabetes, and explored neural changes that may underlie such an interaction. We find that isolating C57BL/6J mice throughout adolescence is sufficient to induce type 2 diabetes. We observed fasted hyperglycemia, diminished glucose clearance in response to an insulin tolerance test, decreased insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, decreased insulin staining of pancreatic islets, increased nociception, and diminished plasma cortisol levels compared to group-housed control mice. Using Promethion metabolic phenotyping chambers, we observed dysregulation of sleep and eating behaviors, as well as a time-dependent shift in respiratory exchange ratio of the adolescent-isolation mice. We profiled changes in neural gene transcription from several brain areas and found that a neural circuit between serotonin-producing and GLP-1-producing neurons is affected by this isolation paradigm. Overall, spatial transcription data suggest decreased serotonin neuron activity (via decreased GLP-1-mediated excitation) and increased GLP-1 neuron activity (via decreased serotonin-mediated inhibition).

    "abstract": "Neurons within dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of primates are characterized by robust persistent spiking activity exhibited during the delay period of working memory tasks. This includes the frontal eye field (FEF) where nearly half of the neurons are active when spatial locations are held in working memory. Past evidence has established the FEFs contribution to the planning and triggering of saccadic eye movements as well as to the control of visual spatial attention. However, it remains unclear if persistent delay activity reflects a similar dual role in movement planning and visuospatial working memory. We trained monkeys to alternate between different forms of a spatial working memory task which could dissociate remembered stimulus locations from planned eye movements. We tested the effects of inactivation of FEF sites on behavioral performance in the different tasks. Consistent with previous studies, FEF inactivation impaired the execution of memory-guided saccades, and impaired performance when remembered locations matched the planned eye movement. In contrast, memory performance was largely unaffected when the remembered location was dissociated from the correct eye movement response. Overall, the inactivation effects demonstrated clear deficits on eye movements, regardless of task type, but little or no evidence of a deficit in spatial working memory. Thus, our results indicate that persistent delay activity in the FEF contributes primarily to the preparation of eye movements and not to spatial working memory.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers Disease (AD) and other age-related diseases are increasingly among the most devastating strains on public health systems as the population ages, yet few treatments produce clinically significant protection. Although it is widely agreed that proteotoxicity drives impairments in AD and other neurological diseases, many preclinical and case-report studies indicate that increased microglial production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a mediate proteotoxicity in AD and other neurological conditions. The critical importance of inflammation, especially TNF-a, in driving age-related diseases is indicated by the fact that Humira, simply a monoclonal antibody to TNF-a, has become the top-selling drug in history, even though it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Since target-based strategies to discover drugs to treat these diseases have largely failed, we developed parallel high-throughput phenotypic screens to discover small molecules which inhibit age-related proteotoxicity in a C. elegans model of AD, AND microglia inflammation (LPS-induced TNF-a). In the initial screen of 2560 compounds to delay Abeta proteotoxicity in C. elegans, the most protective compounds were, in order, phenylbutyrate (HDAC inhibitor), methicillin (beta lactam antibiotic), and quetiapine (tricyclic antipsychotic). These classes of compounds are already robustly implicated as potentially protective in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. In addition to quetiapine, other tricyclic antipsychotic drugs also delayed age-related Abeta proteotoxicity and microglial TNF-a. Based on these results we carried out extensive structure-activity relationship studies, leading to the synthesis of a novel congener of quetiapine, #310, which inhibits a wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse and human myeloid cells, and delays impairments in animal models of AD, Huntingtons, and stroke. #310 is highly concentrated in brain after oral delivery with no apparent toxicity, increases lifespan, and produces molecular responses highly similar to those produced by dietary restriction. Among these molecular responses are induction of CBP and inhibition of CtBP and CSPR1, and inhibition of glycolysis, reversing gene expression profiles and elevated glycolysis associated with AD. Several lines of investigation strongly supported that the protective effects of #310 are mediated by activating the Sigma-1 receptor, whose protective mechanisms in turn also entail inhibiting glycolysis. Reduced glycolysis has also been implicated in the generally protective effects of dietary restriction, rapamycin, reduced IFG-1 activity, and ketones during aging, suggesting that aging is at least in large part a consequence of glycolysis. In particular, the age-related increase in adiposity, and subsequent pancreatic decompensation leading to diabetes, is plausibly a consequence of age-related increase in beta cell glycolysis. Consistent with these observations, the glycolytic inhibitor 2-DG inhibited microglial TNF-a and other markers of inflammation, delayed Abeta proteotoxicity, and increased lifespan. To our knowledge no other molecule exhibits all these protective effects which makes #310 a uniquely promising candidate to treat AD and other age-related diseases. Thus it is plausible that #310 or possibly even more effective congeners could displace Humira as a widely used therapy for age-related diseases. Furthermore, these studies suggest that the efficacy of tricyclic compounds to treat psychosis and depression could be due to their anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the Sigma-1 receptor, rather than the D2 receptor, and that better drugs to treat these conditions, as well as addiction, with fewer metabolic side effects could be developed by focusing on the Sigma-1 receptor rather than the D2 receptor. These results strongly support the value of phenotypic screens to discover drugs to treat AD and other age-related diseases and to elucidate mechanisms driving those diseases.",

    "abstract": "Myopia is a primary contributor to visual impairment and has emerged as a global public health concern. Evidence indicates that one of the main structural features of myopia is the corresponding decrease in choroidal thickness, and choroidal macrophages play an important role in maintaining the choroidal thickness. Nevertheless, the effect of choroidal macrophages on myopia remains unclear. Here, we discovered that the continuous intraperitoneal injection of clodronate liposomes depleted choroidal macrophages and leads to myopia, which confirmed that the presence of choroidal macrophages plays an important role in myopia development. Subsequently, based on the phenotypic characteristics of macrophages, experiments were designed to study the effects of different polarization directions of macrophages on myopia development. We found that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) injection can induce the polarization of choroidal M1 macrophages, thinning the choroidal thickness and resulting in myopia. Conversely, IL-4 or IL-13 injection causes choroidal M2 macrophage polarization, thickens the choroid, and suppresses the progression of myopia. Additionally, we demonstrated that the opposite effects of M1 and M2 macrophages on myopia development may be related to their impacts on choroidal thickness, inflammation, and oxidative stress response. These findings establish that choroidal macrophages are critically important in the development of myopia and provide new strategies for the development of myopic therapies.",

    "abstract": "A number of methods have been developed to assess the enrichment of polygenic risk variants - from summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) - within specific gene-sets, pathways, or cell-type signatures. The assumptions made by these methods vary, which leads to differences in results and performance across different genetic trait architectures and sample sizes. We devise a novel statistical test that combines independent signals from each of three commonly-used enrichment tests (LDSC, MAGMA & SNPsea) into a single P-value, called the block jackknife GWAS joint enrichment test (GWASJET). Through simulations, we show that this method has comparable or greater power than competing methods across a range of sample sizes and trait architectures. We use our new test in an extensive analysis of the cell-type specific enrichment of genetic risk for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohns disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Counterintuitively, we find stronger enrichments of IBD risk genes in older gene expression data from bulk immune cell-types than in single-cell data from inflamed patient intestinal samples. We demonstrate that GWASJET removes many seemingly-spurious enriched cell-types identified by other methods, and identifies a core set of immune cells that express IBD risk genes, particularly myeloid cells that have been experimentally stimulated. We also demonstrate that many cell-types are differentially enriched for CD compared to UC risk genes, for example gamma-delta T cells show stronger enrichment for CD than UC risk genes.\n\nAuthor summaryGenetic association studies have discovered a number of DNA variations that are associated with heritable human diseases and traits. One method of investigating the functions of these variants is to test whether they are enriched in parts of the genome associated with specific cell-types or cell conditions - defined by gene expression data or other similar data types. However, there are a number of published statistical methods to test such enrichments; these methdos make different assumptions and their results can vary, sometimes dramatically. We present a novel consensus method, called GWASJET, that combines the results of these different methods to produce a single result. We show that GWASJET can outperform individual methods in simulations. We apply this method to gene expression data from a number of tissues and conditions relevant to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Our method removes potentially false results based on a priori biological knowledge, and reveals that IBD genes are generally clustered in a large number of immune cell-types, especially myeloid cells treated with specific stimulatory molecules.",

    "abstract": "Allogeneic T cells reprogram their metabolism during acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in a process reliant on the cellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Deletion of AMPK in donor T cells limits GVHD but still preserves homeostatic reconstitution and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects. In the current studies, murine T cells lacking AMPK decreased oxidative metabolism at early timepoints post-transplant and were also unable to mediate a compensatory increase in glycolysis following inhibition of the electron transport chain. Human T cells lacking AMPK gave similar results, with glycolytic compensation impaired both in vitro and following expansion in vivo in a modified model of GVHD. Immunoprecipitation of proteins from day 7 allogeneic T cells, using an antibody specific to phosphorylated AMPK targets, recovered lower levels of multiple glycolysis-related proteins including the glycolytic enzymes aldolase, enolase, pyruvate kinase M (PKM), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Functionally, murine T cells lacking AMPK exhibited impaired aldolase activity following anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation and a decrease in GAPDH activity on day 7 post-transplant. Importantly, these changes in glycolysis correlated with an impaired ability of AMPK KO T cells to produce significant amounts of interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}) upon antigenic re-stimulation. Together these data highlight a significant role for AMPK in controlling oxidative and glycolytic metabolism in both murine and human T cells during GVHD and endorse further study of AMPK inhibition as a potential target for future clinical therapies.\n\nKEY POINTSAMPK plays a key role in driving both and oxidative and glycolytic metabolism in T cells during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)\n\nAbsence of AMPK simultaneously impairs both glycolytic enzyme activity, most notably by aldolase, and interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}) production",

A growing set of microproteins translated from these sORFs are known to have important cellular functions. However, the majority remains uncharacterised. Thus, larger screens to find functional microproteins have become more vital. Here, we performed a high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out screen with a customised library of 11,776 sORFs, curated from literature and databases to identify microproteins essential for cancer cell line growth. 16/17 tested candidates displayed a reproducible knockout phenotype. We selected our top six hits, consisting of 11 to 63 amino acids. Various of these candidates localised to distinct subcellular compartments and the majority showed specific interaction partners. Endogenous tagging demonstrated translation of an sORF in the CENPBD2P pseudogene that bears no resemblance to the CENPBD2P name-giving CENPB DNA binding domains. For two candidates, uORFs in the DSE and NUTF2 genes, the microprotein supplied in trans ameliorated the growth defect of the respective knock-out. RNA-seq analysis revealed however that gene expression changes in the knock-out could only partially be rescued. Overall, we identified various putative microproteins and a microprotein-producing pseudogene that might be involved in cancer cell growth, but also illustrate the limitations and caveats of sORF functional screening and characterisation.",

Excessive dopamine levels including due to cocaine use both in utero and in adults could lead to long-term adverse consequences. The mechanisms underlying both homeostatic and pathological changes remain unclear, partly due to the diverse cellular responses elicited by dopamine and the reliance on animal models that exhibit species- specific differences in dopamine signaling. To address these limitations, 3-D cerebral organoids have emerged as human-derived models, recapitulating salient features of human cell signaling and neurodevelopment. Organoids have demonstrated responsiveness to external stimuli, including substances of abuse, making them valuable investigative models. In this study we utilize the Xiang-Tanaka ventral forebrain organoid model and characterize their response to acute and chronic dopamine or cocaine exposure. The findings revealed a robust immune response, novel response pathways, and a potential critical role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the developing ventral forebrain.

    "abstract": "Predicting the composition and diversity of communities is a central goal in ecology. While community assembly is considered hard to predict, laboratory microcosms often follow a simple assembly rule based on the outcome of pairwise competitions. This assembly rule predicts that a species that is excluded by another species in pairwise competition cannot survive in a multispecies community with that species. Despite the empirical success of this bottom-up prediction, its mechanistic origin has remained elusive. In this study, we elucidate how this simple pattern in community assembly can emerge from resource competition. Our geometric analysis of a consumer-resource model shows that trio community assembly is always predictable from pairwise outcomes when one species grows faster than another species on every resource. We also identify all possible trio assembly outcomes under three resources and find that only two outcomes violate the assembly rule. Simulations demonstrate that pairwise competitions accurately predict trio assembly with up to 100 resources and the assembly of larger communities containing up to twelve species. We then further demonstrate accurate quantitative prediction of community composition using harmonic mean of pairwise fractions. Finally, we show that cross-feeding between species does not decrease assembly rule prediction accuracy. Our findings highlight that simple community assembly can emerge even in ecosystems with complex underlying dynamics.\n\nSignificanceMultispecies microbial communities play an essential role in the health of ecosystems ranging from the ocean to the human gut. A major challenge in microbial ecology is to understand and predict which species can coexist within a community. While a simple empirical rule utilizing only pairwise outcomes successfully predicts multispecies laboratory communities, its mechanistic origin has remained unexplained. Here, we find that the observed simplicity can emerge from competition for resources. Using a generic consumer-resource model, we demonstrate that community assembly of highly complex ecosystems is nevertheless well predicted by pairwise competitions. Our results argue that community assembly can be surprisingly simple despite the potential complexity associated with competition and crossfeeding of many different resources by many different species.",

The heterogeneity, dynamic nature, and low abundance of protein complexes in their native states present tremendous challenges to study using conventional structural biology techniques. Here we develop a \"native nanoproteomics\" strategy for the native enrichment and subsequent native top-down mass spectrometry (nTDMS) of of low-abundance protein complexes. Specifically, we demonstrate the first comprehensive characterization of the structure and dynamics of cardiac troponin (cTn) complexes directly from human heart tissue. The endogenous cTn complex is effectively enriched and purified using peptide-functionalized superparamagnetic nanoparticles under non-denaturing conditions to enable the isotopic resolution of cTn complexes, revealing their complex structure and assembly. Moreover, nTDMS elucidates the stoichiometry and composition of the heterotrimeric cTn complex, localizes Ca2+ binding domains (II-IV), defines cTn-Ca2+ binding dynamics, and provides high-resolution mapping of the proteoform landscape. This native nanoproteomics strategy opens a new paradigm for structural characterization of low-abundance native protein complexes.",

Focusing on process- associated cells and genes enables accurate estimation of process-specific velocities via a master equation for a transcriptional burst model accounting for intrinsic stochasticity. The method obtains a global transition matrix by leveraging cell topic weights to integrate process- specific signals.

Although controversial, choosing the wrong codon optimization strategy can have detrimental effects on protein and product levels. In this study, we analyzed 11 different codon variants of an engineered T1PKS and investigated in a systematic approach their influence on heterologous expression in Corynebacterium glutamicum, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas putida. Our best performing codon variants exhibited a minimum 50-fold increase in PKS protein levels, which also enables the production of an unnatural polyketide in each of the hosts.

At face value, dense microbial habitats are expected to be vulnerable to phage epidemics due to the abundance of fresh hosts immediately next to any infected bacteria. Despite this, the bacterial microcolony is a common habitat for bacteria in nature. Here we experimentally quantify the fate of microcolonies of Escherichia coli exposed to virulent phage T 4. It has been proposed that the outer bacterial layers of the colony will shield the inner layers from the phage invasion and thereby constrain the phage to the surface of the colony. We develop a dynamical model that incorporates this shielding mechanism and compares the predictions with experimental measurements. The analysis suggests that, while the shielding mechanism delays phage attack, T4 phage are able to diffuse so deep into the dense bacterial environment that colony level survival of the bacterial community is challenged.\n\nSignificanceThe shielding mechanism of bacterial microcolonies against phage invasion has been experimentally quantified, and the result was analyzed by using a mathematical model. The analysis suggests that while forming a dense colony delays phage attack by limiting the infection closer to the colony surface, T4 phage can diffuse so deep into the dense bacterial environment that colony-level survival of the bacterial community is challenged.

Here I explore the 19 Worldclim bioclimatic variables from the perspective of the manifold hypothesis: that many high dimensional datasets are actually confined to a lower dimensional manifold embedded in an ambient space. Using a state of the art generative probabilistic model (variational autoencoder) to model the data on a non-linear manifold reveals that only 5 uncorrelated dimensions are adequate to capture the full range of variation in the bioclimatic variables. I show that these 5 variables have meaningful structure and are sufficient to produce species distribution models (SDMs) nearly as good and in some ways better than SDMs using the original 19 bioclimatic variables.

    "abstract": "Many organisms exhibit branching morphologies that twist around each other and become entangled. Entanglement occurs when different objects interlock with each other, creating complex and often irreversible configurations. This physical phenomenon is well-studied in non-living materials, such as granular matter, polymers, and wires, where it has been shown that entanglement is highly sensitive to the geometry of the component parts. However, entanglement is not yet well understood in living systems, despite its presence in many organisms. In fact, recent work has shown that entanglement can evolve rapidly, and play a crucial role in the evolution of tough, macroscopic multicellular groups. Here, through a combination of experiments, simulations, and numerical analyses, we show that growth generically facilitates entanglement for a broad range of geometries. We find that experimentally grown entangled branches can be difficult or even impossible to disassemble through translation and rotation of rigid components, suggesting that there are many configurations of branches that growth can access that agitation cannot. We use simulations to show that branching trees readily grow into entangled configurations. In contrast to non-growing entangled materials, these trees entangle for a broad range of branch geometries. We thus propose that entanglement via growth is largely insensitive to the geometry of branched-trees, but instead will depend sensitively on time scales, ultimately achieving an entangled state once sufficient growth has occurred. We test this hypothesis in experiments with snowflake yeast, a model system of undifferentiated, branched multicellularity, showing that lengthening the time of growth leads to entanglement, and that entanglement via growth can occur for a wide range of geometries. Taken together, our work demonstrates that entanglement is more readily achieved in living systems than in their non-living counterparts, providing a widely-accessible and powerful mechanism for the evolution of novel biological material properties.",

    "abstract": "The microbes associated with an organism play a pivotal role in modulating their host susceptibility to viral infections. However, the influence of individual microbes on viral infections is not well understood. Here, we examined the impact of 67 naturally bacterial associates on Caenorhabditis elegans susceptibility to Orsay virus. Our findings reveal that viral infection of C. elegans is significantly influenced by monobacterial environments. The majority of tested natural bacterial environments reduced C. elegans viral infection while some increased susceptibility compared to an Escherichia coli environmental reference. The reduction in viral infection is not caused by degradation of the virions or poor nutrition of C. elegans by the bacteria. The reduction in viral infection does not require known antiviral responses, including RNA interference and transcriptional regulation downstream of the RIG-I homolog DRH-1. However, one bacterium, Lelliottia JUb276, reduced susceptibility but does not induce resistance to viral infection in drh-1 mutants. Our research underscores the importance of considering the natural biotic environment in studies of viral infections and provides insights for future research on host-microbes-virus interactions and viral immunity.\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSConceptualization: RG, MAF; Formal analysis: RG; Investigation: RG; Resources: MAF; Data Curation: RG; Writing - Original Draft: RG, MAF; Writing - Review & Editing: RG, MAF; Visualization: RG; Supervision: MAF; Project administration: RG, MAF; Funding acquisition: RG, MAF.",

While anti-stem Abs are not believed to block viral attachment, we show that C1q confers attachment inhibition and boosts fusion and neuraminidase inhibition, greatly enhancing virus neutralization activity in vitro and in mice challenged with influenza virus via the respiratory route. These effects reflect increased steric interference and not increased Ab avidity. Remarkably, C1q greatly expands the anti-stem Ab viral escape repertoire to include residues throughout the hemagglutinin. Some substitutions cause antigenic alterations in the globular region or modulate HA receptor avidity. We also show that C1q enhances the neutralization activity of non-RBD anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike Abs, an effect dependent on Spike density on the virion surface. Together, our findings show that first, Ab function must be considered in a physiological context and second, inferring the exact selection pressure for Ab-driven viral evolution is risky business, at best.",

    "abstract": "The clinical management of severe COVID-19 cases is not yet well resolved. Therefore, it is important to identify and characterize cell signaling pathways involved in virus pathogenesis that can be targeted therapeutically. Envelope (E) protein is a structural protein of the virus, which is known to be highly expressed in the infected host cell and is a key virulence factor, however, its role is poorly characterized. The E protein is a single-pass transmembrane protein that can assemble into a pentamer forming a viroporin, perturbing Ca2+ homeostasis. Because it is structurally similar to regulins such as, for example, phospholamban, that regulate the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases (SERCA), we investigated whether the SARS-CoV-2 E protein affects the SERCA system as an exoregulin. Using FRET experiments we demonstrate that E protein can form oligomers with regulins, and thus can alter the monomer/multimer regulin ratio and consequently influence their interactions with SERCAs. We also confirmed that a direct interaction between E protein and SERCA2b results in a decrease in SERCA-mediated ER Ca2+ reload. Structural modeling and molecular dynamics of the complexes indicates an overlapping interaction site for E protein and endogenous regulins. Our results reveal novel links in the host-virus interaction network that play an important role in viral pathogenesis and may provide a new therapeutic target for managing severe inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV-2.",

S. aureus has become a  superbug by challenging conventional as well as modern treatment strategies. Nowadays, drug repurposing has become a new trend for the discovery of new drug molecules. This study focuses on evaluating FDA-approved drugs that can be repurposed against S. aureus infection. Steered molecular dynamics (SMD) has been performed for Lumacaftor and Olaparib against staphylococcal FemX to understand their binding to the active site. A time-dependent external force or rupture has been applied to the ligands to calculate the force required to dislocate the ligand from the binding pocket. SMD analysis indicates that Lumacaftor has a high affinity for the substrate binding pocket in comparison to Olaparib. Umbrella sampling exhibits that Lumacaftor possesses a higher free energy barrier to displace it from the ligand-binding site. The bactericidal activity of Lumacaftor and Olaparib has been tested, and it shows that Lumacaftor has shown moderate activity along with biofilm inhibition potential (MIC value with conc. 128 g/mL). Pharmacokinetic and toxicology evaluations indicate that Lumacaftor has higher pharmacokinetic potential with lower toxicity. This is the first experimental report where staphylococcal FemX has been targeted for the discovery of new drugs. It is suggested that Lumacaftor may be a potential lead molecule against S. aureus.",

During growth and fermentation, the microbes are often exposed to stress conditions, like variations in pH or solvent concentrations and it has been described that bacterial membranes play a key role in response to abiotic stresses. Ornithine lipids (OLs) are a group of membrane lipids whose presence and synthesis have been related to stress resistance in different bacteria. In this study, we engineered different E. coli strains to produce unmodified OLs and hydroxylated OLs by expressing the synthetic operon olsFC. Our results showed that OL formation improved pH resistance and increased biomass under phosphate limitation. Transcriptome analysis revealed that OL-forming strains differentially expressed stress and membrane-related genes. OL-producing strains also showed better growth in the presence of the ionophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), suggesting reduced proton leakiness. Furthermore, our engineered strains showed improved heterologous violacein production at phosphate limitation and low pH. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of engineering the E. coli membrane composition for constructing robust hosts for biotechnology and synthetic biology applications.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=138 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/544863v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f6bdf3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@130b49borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a151a7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f7b9a0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphical abstract.C_FLOATNO Escherichia coli strains forming ornithine lipids in addition to glycerophospholipids show increased resistance to acidic pH, improved growth under phosphate-limiting conditions, and allowed a higher production of violacein in a heterologous expression system.

    "abstract": "Rapid spread of insecticide resistance among anopheline mosquitoes threatens malaria elimination efforts, necessitating development of alternative vector control technologies. Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) has been successfully implemented in multiple insect pests to suppress field populations by the release of large numbers of sterile males, yet it has proven difficult to adapt to Anopheles vectors. Here we outline adaptation of a CRISPR-based genetic sterilization system to selectively ablate male sperm cells in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae. We achieve robust mosaic biallelic mutagenesis of zero population growth (zpg, a gene essential for differentiation of germ cells) in F1 individuals after intercrossing a germline-expressing Cas9 transgenic line to a line expressing zpg-targeting gRNAs. Approximately 95% of mutagenized males display complete genetic sterilization, and cause similarly high levels of infertility in their female mates. Using a fluorescence reporter that allows detection of the germline leads to a 100% accurate selection of spermless males, improving the system. These males cause a striking reduction in mosquito population size when released at field-like frequencies in competition cages against wild type males. These findings demonstrate that such a genetic system could be adopted for SIT against important malaria vectors.",

    "abstract": "A self-cleaving ribozyme that maps to an intron of the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 3 (CPEB3) gene is thought to play a role in human episodic memory, but the underlying mechanisms mediating this effect are not known. We tested the activity of the murine sequence and found that the ribozymes self-scission half-life matches the time it takes an RNA polymerase to reach the immediate downstream exon, suggesting that the ribozyme-dependent intron cleavage is tuned to co-transcriptional splicing of the CPEB3 mRNA. Our studies also reveal that the murine ribozyme modulates maturation of its harboring mRNA in both cultured cortical neurons and the hippocampus: inhibition of the ribozyme using an antisense oligonucleotide leads to increased CPEB3 protein expression, which enhances polyadenylation and translation of localized plasticity-related target mRNAs, and subsequently strengthens hippocampal-dependent long-term memory. These findings reveal a previously unknown role for self-cleaving ribozyme activity in regulating experience-induced co-transcriptional and local translational processes required for learning and memory.\n\nSignificance StatementCytoplasmic polyadenylation-induced translation is one of the key steps for regulating protein synthesis and neuroplasticity in the hippocampus. The CPEB3 ribozyme is a highly conserved mammalian self-cleaving catalytic RNA with unknown biological roles. In this study, we investigated how the intronic ribozyme affects the CPEB3 mRNA maturation and translation, and its subsequent effect on memory formation. Our findings show that the ribozyme activity is anti-correlated with CPEB3 mRNA splicing: inhibition of the ribozyme results in higher mRNA and protein levels, which contribute to long-term memory. Our studies offer new insights into the role of the CPEB3 ribozyme in neuronal translational control for the activity-dependent synaptic functions that underlie long-term memory and demonstrate a novel biological role for self-cleaving ribozymes.",

AIS patient management targets the ischemic penumbra: Hypoperfused, electrically silent brain tissue, which can be salvaged by restoring blood flow during the first, critical hours after symptom onset. Neuroimaging studies in AIS patients suggest that penumbral tissue is characterized not only by hypoperfusion, but also by microvascular flow disturbances that strongly affect tissue outcome. Here, we demonstrate that microvascular flows become increasingly chaotic in the ischemic penumbra in the hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion in a rat model of AIS. Biophysical models suggest that these disturbances are accompanied by increasing hypoxia in the absence of blood flow changes. Unlike findings in severe ischemia, pericyte constrictions do not appear to occlude penumbral capillaries. We propose that microvascular flow disturbances represent a critical feature of penumbral tissue, and a potential target for neuroprotective therapy after AIS.",

    "abstract": "Apicomplexan parasites, including Toxoplasma gondii, encode many plant-like proteins, which play significant roles and present attractive targets for drug development. In this study, we have characterized the plant-like protein phosphatase PPKL, which is unique to the parasite and absent in its mammalian host. We have shown that its localization changes as the parasite divides. In non-dividing parasites, it is present in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and preconoidal region. As the parasite begins division, PPKL is enriched in the preconoidal region and the cortical cytoskeleton of the nascent parasites. Later in the division, PPKL is present in the basal complex ring. Conditional knockdown of PPKL showed that it is essential for parasite propagation. Moreover, parasites lacking PPKL exhibit uncoupling of division, with normal DNA duplication but severe defects in forming daughter parasites. While PPKL depletion does not impair the duplication of centrosomes, it affects the rigidity and arrangement of the cortical microtubules. Both Co-Immunoprecipitation and proximity labeling identified the kinase DYRK1 as a potential functional partner of PPKL. Complete knockout of DYRK1 phenocopies lack of PPKL, strongly suggesting a functional relationship between these two signaling proteins. Global phosphoproteomics analysis revealed a significant increase in phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated proteins SPM1 in PPKL-depleted parasites, suggesting PPKL regulates the cortical microtubules by mediating the phosphorylation state of SPM1. More importantly, the phosphorylation of cell cycle-associated kinase Crk1, a known regulator of daughter cell assembly, is altered in PPKL-depleted parasites. Thus, we propose that PPKL regulates daughter parasite development by influencing the Crk1-dependent signaling pathway.\n\nImportanceToxoplasma gondii can cause severe disease in immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients and during congenital infections. Treating toxoplasmosis presents enormous challenges since the parasite shares many biological processes with its mammalian hosts, which results in significant side effects with current therapies. Consequently, proteins that are essential and unique to the parasite represent favorable targets for drug development. Interestingly, Toxoplasma, like other members of the phylum Apicomplexa, has numerous plant-like proteins, many of which play crucial roles and do not have equivalents in the mammalian host. In this study, we found that the plant-like protein phosphatase, PPKL, appears to be a key regulator of daughter parasite development. With the depletion of PPKL, the parasite shows severe defects in forming daughter parasites. This study provides novel insights into the understanding of parasite division and offers a new potential target for the development of antiparasitic drugs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRetinoic acid (RA) functions as a ligand for the nuclear RA receptors (RARs), which regulate the expression of target genes by binding to RA response elements. RA signaling is required for multiple processes during chordate embryonic development, such as body axis extension, hindbrain antero-posterior patterning and forelimb bud initiation. Although some RA target genes have been identified, little is known about the genome-wide effects of RA signaling during in vivo embryonic development.\n\nResultsHere we stimulate the RA pathway during development by treating zebrafish embryos with all-trans-RA (atRA), the most abundant form of RA, and use a combination of RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq and HiChIP to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms by which RA signaling control target gene expression. We find that RA signaling is involved in anterior/posterior patterning and development of the central nervous system, participating in the transition from pluripotency to differentiation. atRA treatment also induces alterations in chromatin accessibility during early development and promotes chromatin binding of RARa and the RA targets Hoxb1b, Meis2b and Sox3, which cooperate in central nervous system development. Finally, we show that RA induces a rewiring of chromatin architecture, with alterations in chromatin 3D interactions that are consistent with target gene expression. This is illustrated by the specific induction of anterior HoxB genes by RARs, among other examples.\n\nConclusionsAltogether, our findings identify genome-wide targets of RA signaling during embryonic development and provide a molecular mechanism by which developmental signaling pathways regulate the expression of target genes by altering chromatin topology.",

    "abstract": "Live imaging of RNA molecules constitutes an invaluable means to track the dynamics of mRNAs, but live imaging in Caenorhabditis elegans has been difficult to achieve. Endogenous transcripts have been observed in nuclei, but endogenous mRNAs have not been detected in the cytoplasm, and functional mRNAs have not been generated. Here, we have adapted live imaging methods to visualize mRNA in embryonic epithelial cells. We have tagged endogenous transcripts with MS2 hairpins in the 3 Untranslated Region (UTR) and visualized them after adjusting MS2 Coat Protein (MCP) expression. A reduced number of these transcripts accumulate in the cytoplasm, leading to loss-of-function phenotypes. In addition, mRNAs for dlg-1 fail to associate with the adherens junction, as observed for the endogenous mRNA. These defects are reversed by inactivating the nonsense-mediated decay pathway. RNA accumulates in the cytoplasm, dlg-1 associates with the adherens junction, and mutant phenotypes are rescued. These data suggest that MS2 repeats can induce the degradation of endogenous targets and alter the cytoplasmic distribution. Although our focus is RNAs expressed in epithelial cells during morphogenesis, this method can likely be applied to other cell types and stages.\n\nSummary statementAn adapted MS2-MCP method to tag endogenous transcripts in C. elegans embryos for live imaging without affecting mRNA stability.",

    "abstract": "Bloodwork is a widely used diagnostic tool in veterinary medicine, as diagnosis and therapeutic interventions often rely on blood biomarkers. However, biomarkers available in veterinary medicine often lack sensitivity or specificity. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics technology has been extensively used in biological fluids and offers excellent potential for a more comprehensive characterization of the plasma proteome in veterinary medicine. In this study, we aimed to identify and quantify plasma proteins in a cohort of healthy dogs and compare two techniques for depleting high-abundance plasma proteins to enable the detection of lower-abundance proteins. We utilized surplus lithium-heparin plasma from 30 healthy dogs, which were subdivided into five groups of pooled plasma from 6 randomly selected individuals each. Our goal was to identify and quantify plasma proteins via label-free quantification LC-mass spectrometry. Additionally, we employed different methods to deplete the most abundant proteins. Firstly, we used a commercial kit for the depletion of high-abundance plasma proteins. Secondly, we employed an in-house method to remove albumin using Blue-Sepharose. Among all the samples, some of the most abundant proteins identified were apolipoprotein A and B, albumin, alpha-2-macroglobulin, fibrinogen beta chain, fibronectin, complement C3, serotransferrin, and coagulation Factor V. However, neither of the depletion techniques achieved significant depletion of high-abundant proteins. Nevertheless, the two different depletion methods exhibited substantial differences in the fold-change of many proteins, suggesting partial depletion that did not contribute to an increase in the number of detected proteins. Despite this limitation, we were able to detect and quantify many clinically relevant proteins. The determination of the healthy canine proteome is a crucial first step in establishing a reference proteome for canine plasma. This reference proteome can later be utilized to identify protein markers associated with different diseases, thereby contributing to the diagnosis and prognosis of various pathologies.",

Here, we report the results from a series of in vitro experiments to identify innate, human inducers of MtrR and to understand the biochemical and structural mechanisms of the gene regulatory function of MtrR. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments reveal that MtrR binds the hormonal steroids progesterone, {beta}-estradiol, and testosterone, all of which are present at significant concentrations at urogenital infection sites as well as ethinyl estrogen, a component of some birth control pills. Binding of these steroids results in decreased affinity of MtrR for cognate DNA, as demonstrated by fluorescence polarization-based assays. The crystal structures of MtrR bound to each steroid provided insight into the flexibility of the binding pocket, elucidated specific residue-ligand interactions, and revealed the conformational consequences of the induction mechanism of MtrR. Three residues, D171, W136 and R176 are key to the specific binding of these gonadal steroids. These studies provide a molecular understanding of the transcriptional regulation by MtrR that promotes N. gonorrhoeae survival in its human host.",

    "abstract": "More than two hundred genetic mutations of Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have been identified in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective death of motor neurons through ferroptosis. Two ALS-causing SOD1 mutations, H46R and G85R, are metal-binding region mutants with reduced affinity for metal ions. Here, we generated amyloid fibrils from the apo forms of H46R and G85R under reducing conditions and determined their structures using cryo-EM. We built models for the fibril cores, comprising residues 85-153 for H46R and 82-153 for G85R. These mutations disrupt crucial interactions in the wild-type SOD1 fibril, resulting in amyloid fibrils with distinct structures compared to the wild-type fibril. Remarkably, H46R and G85R form similar novel amyloid fibril structures. The fibril cores display a serpentine fold containing seven or eight {beta}-strands, which are stabilized by a hydrophobic cavity. In the G85R fibril core, Arg85 and Asp101 form a salt bridge for stabilization. We demonstrate that fibril seeds from H46R and G85R cause more severe mitochondrial impairment and significantly promote ferroptosis in neuronal cells, compared with those from wild-type SOD1. Our findings reveal how different SOD1 mutations can result in similar amyloid fibril structures and contribute to ALS pathology.",

Here, we characterize a 12-nucleotide deletion in the rplF gene encoding the uL6 ribosomal protein, which was identified in a tobramycin-resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from a cystic fibrosis patient. To understand this resistance, we determined 87 cryo-EM structures of wild-type and mutant ribosomes characterizing their conformational landscape. Our analysis reveals how detuning of the ribosome dynamics alters its rotational movement circumventing tobramycin inhibition. The mutation compromises the 50S assembly, triggering structural instability and inducing a different rotational dynamic of the 70S. We found 4 new binding sites of tobramycin, one of them exclusive of the mutant, where the binding of the antibiotic acts as an allosteric activator skipping inhibition. Our data also illustrate how chloramphenicol stabilizes the mutant ribosome, enhancing inhibition and thereby leading to collateral sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Malaria merozoites phosphorylate erythrocyte membrane proteins to breach the membrane during invasion. This study aimed to develop a constitutive model for erythrocyte membrane phosphorylation that reduces the membranes elastic modulus and resistance to merozoite invasion. The hyperelastic Mooney Rivlin constitutive model was adapted by adding an exponential term to represent the mechanical effect of erythrocyte membrane phosphorylation. The modified algorithm was verified with the unmodified Mooney Rivlin model for the intact erythrocyte membrane and used to predict erythrocyte membrane stress for equi-biaxial membrane strain up to 1.1 for different severity of phosphorylation damage. The stability of the damage model was assessed using the Drucker criterion for equi-biaxial strain up to 2.0. Strain and stress predicted with the developed damage model and the Mooney Rivlin model agreed for the intact erythrocyte membrane. The membrane stress at a strain of 1.1 decreased by 42% for minor and 95% for severe erythrocyte membrane damage. The stability strain threshold of the damage model was 1.98 for minor and 1.19 for severe membrane damage. The developed model can represent different degrees of erythrocyte membrane damage through phosphorylation by a malaria merozoite. The model will enable in silico investigations of the invasiveness of malaria merozoites.",

    "abstract": "Myeloid phagocytes of the respiratory immune system, such as neutrophils, monocytes, and alveolar macrophages, are essential for immunity to Aspergillus fumigatus, the most common etiologic agent of mold pneumonia worldwide. Following engulfment of A. fumigatus conidia, fusion of the phagosome with the lysosome, is a critical process for killing conidia. TFEB and TFE3 are transcription factors that regulate lysosomal biogenesis under stress and are activated by inflammatory stimuli in macrophages, but it is unknown whether TFEB and TFE3 contribute to anti-Aspergillus immunity during infection. We found that lung neutrophils express TFEB and TFE3, and their target genes were upregulated during A. fumigatus lung infection. Additionally, A. fumigatus infection induced nuclear accumulation of TFEB and TFE3 in macrophages in a process regulated by Dectin-1 and CARD9 signaling. Genetic deletion of Tfeb and Tfe3 impaired macrophage killing of A. fumigatus conidia. However, in a murine immune competent Aspergillus infection model with genetic deficiency of Tfeb and Tfe3 in hematopoietic cells, we surprisingly found that lung myeloid phagocytes had no defects in conidial phagocytosis or killing. Loss of TFEB and TFE3 did not impact murine survival or clearance of A. fumigatus from the lungs. Our findings indicate that myeloid phagocytes activate TFEB and TFE3 in response to A. fumigatus, and while this pathway promotes macrophage fungicidal activity in vitro, genetic loss can be functionally compensated at the portal of infection in the lung, resulting in no measurable defect in fungal control and host survival.",

    "abstract": "The NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome is activated when NAIP binds to a gram-negative bacterial ligand. Initially, NAIP exists in an inactive state with a wide-open conformation. Upon ligand binding, the winged helix domain (WHD) of NAIP is activated and forms steric clash with NLRC4 to open it up. However, how ligand binding induces the conformational change of NAIP is less clear. To understand this process, we investigated the dynamics of the ligand binding region of inactive NAIP5 and solved the cryo-EM structure of NAIP5 in complex with its specific ligand, FliC from flagellin, at 2.93 [A] resolution. The structure revealed a \"trap and lock\" mechanism in FliC recognition, whereby FliC-D0C is first trapped by the hydrophobic pocket of NAIP5, then locked in the binding site by the insertion domain (ID) and C-terminal tail (CTT) of NAIP5. The FliC-D0N domain further inserts into the loop of ID to stabilize the complex. According to this mechanism, FliC activates NAIP5 by bringing multiple flexible domains together, particularly the ID, HD2, and LRR domains, to form the active conformation and support the WHD loop in triggering NLRC4 activation.",

This formula involves the transition density of a skew diffusion which appears as a scaling limit of the ancestral lineages of individuals in this model.

    "abstract": "As a population genetic tool, mitochondrial DNA is commonly divided into the [~]1-kb control region (CR), in which single nucleotide variant (SNV) diversity is relatively high, and the coding region, in which selective constraint is greater and diversity lower, but which provides an informative phylogeny. In some species, the CR contains variable tandemly repeated sequences that are understudied due to heteroplasmy. Domestic cats (Felis catus) have a recent origin and therefore traditional CR-based analysis of populations yields only a small number of haplotypes. To increase resolution we used Nanopore sequencing to analyse 119 cat mitogenomes via a long-amplicon approach. This greatly improves discrimination (from 15 to 87 distinct haplotypes) and defines a phylogeny showing similar starlike topologies within all cat haplogroups, likely reflecting post-domestication expansion. We sequenced RS2, a CR tandem array of 80-bp repeat units, placing RS2 array structures within the phylogeny and increasing overall haplotype diversity. Repeat number varies between 3 and 12 (median: 4) with over 30 different repeat unit types differing largely by SNVs. Five SNVs show evidence of independent recurrence within the phylogeny, and seven are involved in at least 11 instances of rapid spread along repeat arrays within haplogroups. In defining mitogenome variation our study provides key information for the forensic genetic analysis of cat hair evidence, and for the first time a phylogenetically informed picture of tandem repeat variation that reveals remarkably dynamic mutation processes at work in the mitochondrion.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications of histone tails alter chromatin accessibility to regulate gene expression. Some viruses exploit the importance of histone modifications by expressing histone mimetic proteins that contain histone-like sequences to sequester complexes that recognize modified histones. Here we identify an evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed, endogenous mammalian protein Nucleolar protein 16 (NOP16) that functions as a H3K27 mimic. NOP16 binds to EED in the H3K27 trimethylation PRC2 complex and to the H3K27 demethylase JMJD3. NOP16 knockout selectively globally increases H3K27me3, a heterochromatin mark, without altering methylation of H3K4, H3K9, or H3K36 or acetylation of H3K27. NOP16 is overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis in breast cancer. Depletion of NOP16 in breast cancer cell lines causes cell cycle arrest, decreases cell proliferation and selectively decreases expression of E2F target genes and of genes involved in cell cycle, growth and apoptosis. Conversely, ectopic NOP16 expression in triple negative breast cancer cell lines increases cell proliferation, cell migration and invasivity in vitro and tumor growth in vivo, while NOP16 knockout or knockdown has the opposite effect. Thus, NOP16 is a histone mimic that competes with Histone H3 for H3K27 methylation and demethylation. When it is overexpressed in cancer, it derepresses genes that promote cell cycle progression to augment breast cancer growth.",

Within glioma, mutations in the genes encoding the histones H3.1 and H3.3 have been discovered to be age-restricted and specific of pHGGs. This work focuses on the study of pHGGs harboring the H3.3-G34R mutation. H3.3-G34R tumors represent the 9-15% of pHGGs, are restricted to the cerebral hemispheres, and are found predominantly in the adolescent population (median 15.0 years). We have utilized a genetically engineered immunocompetent mouse model for this subtype of pHGG generated via the Sleeping Beauty-transposon system. The analysis of H3.3-G34R genetically engineered brain tumors by RNA-Sequencing and ChIP-Sequencing revealed alterations in the molecular landscape associated to H3.3-G34R expression. In particular, the expression of H3.3-G34R modifies the histone marks deposited at the regulatory elements of genes belonging to the JAK/STAT pathway, leading to an increased activation of this pathway. This histone G34R-mediated epigenetic modifications lead to changes in the tumor immune microenvironment of these tumors, towards an immune-permissive phenotype, making these gliomas susceptible to TK/Flt3L immune-stimulatory gene therapy. The application of this therapeutic approach increased median survival of H3.3-G34R tumor bearing animals, while stimulating the development of anti-tumor immune response and immunological memory. Our data suggests that the proposed immune-mediated gene therapy has potential for clinical translation for the treatment of patients harboring H3.3-G34R high grade gliomas.",

Despite approximately 20 years of ex situ breeding and reintroduction programs, these animals remain functionally extinct in the wild. There is concern among those working in these programs that individuals bred in captivity fail to develop the proper microbiome to withstand the stressors of their native habitat following release. In related species, the skin microbiome has been shown to have a defensive function against common pathogens affecting these animals. However, the early-life microbiome of developing tadpoles in this species remains unknown and therefore this defensive function is unexplored in the Wyoming toad. This study employed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to document the baseline microbiome of tadpoles bred for release and captive adult breeder populations. To characterize microbiome development, multiple rounds of skin mucosal and cloacal swabs were obtained concurrently from adult Wyoming toads bred at Omahas Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium. Our results revealed significant differences between tadpole and adult microbiomes, as well as significant sex-dependent differences within the adult Wyoming toads, in terms of richness and composition. Thus, these findings have identified the baseline microbiome of this endangered species, and variables significantly influencing its composition. Ongoing studies of the only extant wild population are expected to identify taxa not present in captive toads, and potentially help design husbandry modifications to maximize survivability following reintroduction to the wild.",

    "abstract": "Cryptosporidium parvum is a significant pathogen causing gastrointestinal infections in humans and animals, that is spread through the ingestion of contaminated food and water. Despite its global impact on public health, generating a C. parvum genome sequence has always been challenging due to a lack of in vitro cultivation systems and challenging sub-telomeric gene families. A gapless telomere to telomere genome assembly has been created for Cryptosporidium parvum IOWA obtained from Bunch Grass Farms, named here as CpBGF. There are 8 chromosomes that total 9,259,183 bp. The new hybrid assembly which was generated with Illumina and Oxford Nanopore resolves complex sub-telomeric regions of chromosomes 1, 7 and 8. To facilitate ease of use and consistency with the literature, whenever possible, chromosomes have been oriented and genes in this annotation have been given the same gene IDs used in the current reference genome sequence generated in 2004. The annotation of this assembly utilized considerable RNA expression evidence, thus, untranslated regions, long noncoding RNAs and antisense RNAs are annotated. The CpBGF genome assembly serves as a valuable resource for understanding the biology, pathogenesis, and transmission of C. parvum, and it facilitates the development of diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines against cryptosporidiosis.",

    "abstract": "Climate change as a global crisis demands a shift from a fossil fuel-based economy to-wards sustainable solutions. Cyanobacteria are promising organisms for the truly sustainable, carbon-neutral production of various chemicals. However, so far, proof of concepts for large-scale cyanobacterial productions that produce industrial-relevant amounts of desired products are lacking. To systematically address this topic, a comprehensive overview that identifies current obstacles and solutions is missing.\n\nWe conducted a quantitative survey among researchers in the cyanobacterial community. This work investigates individual experiences and challenges in the field of cyanobacteria, as well as information about specific protocols. Additionally, qualitative interviews with academic experts were conducted. Their answers were compared, and highlights were summarised.\n\nIn this work, we provide for the first time a comprehensive overview of current trends and challenges as perceived by researchers in the field of cyanobacteria. Based on the results of the survey and interviews, we formulate a set of recommendations on how to improve the working conditions within the cyanobacteria research community.",

    "abstract": "Spirochete bacteria cause Lyme disease, leptospirosis, syphilis and several other human illnesses. Unlike other bacteria, spirochete flagella are enclosed within the periplasmic space where the filaments distort and push the cell body by action of the flagellar motors. We previously demonstrated that the oral pathogen Treponema denticola (Td) catalyzes the formation of covalent lysinoalanine (Lal) crosslinks between conserved cysteine and lysine residues of the FlgE protein that composes the flagellar hook. Although not necessary for hook assembly, Lal is required for motility of Td, presumably due to the stabilizing effect of the crosslink. Herein, we extend these findings to other, representative spirochete species across the phylum. We confirm the presence of Lal crosslinked peptides in recombinant and in vivo-derived samples from Treponema spp., Borreliella spp., Brachyspira spp., and Leptospira spp.. Like with Td, a mutant strain of the Lyme disease pathogen Borreliella burgdorferi unable to form the crosslink has impaired motility. FlgE from Leptospira spp. does not conserve the Lal-forming cysteine residue which is instead substituted by serine. Nevertheless, Leptospira interrogans also forms Lal, with several different Lal isoforms being detected between Ser-179 and Lys-145, Lys-148, and Lys-166, thereby highlighting species or order-specific differences within the phylum. Our data reveals that the Lal crosslink is a conserved and necessary post-translational modification across the spirochete phylum and may thus represent an effective target for spirochete-specific antimicrobials.\n\nSignificance StatementThe phylum Spirochaetota contains bacterial pathogens responsible for a variety of diseases, including Lyme disease, syphilis, periodontal disease, and leptospirosis. Motility of these pathogens is a major virulence factor that contributes to infectivity and host colonization. The oral pathogen Treponema denticola produces a post-translational modification (PTM) in the form of a lysinoalanine (Lal) crosslink between neighboring subunits of the flagellar hook protein FlgE. Herein, we demonstrate that representative spirochetes species across the phylum all form Lal in their flagellar hooks. T. denticola and B. burgdorferi cells incapable of forming the crosslink are non-motile, thereby establishing the general role of the Lal PTM in the unusual type of flagellar motility evolved by spirochetes.",

    "abstract": "RationaleCovid-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is a life-threatening complication in patients with severe COVID-19. Previously, acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19 has been associated with lung fungal dysbiosis, evidenced by reduced microbial diversity and Candida colonisation. Increased fungal burden in the lungs of critically ill COVID-19 patients is linked to prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased mortality. However, specific mycobiome signatures associated with severe COVID-19 in the context of survival and antifungal drug prophylaxis have not yet been determined and such knowledge could have an important impact on treatment.\n\nObjectivesTo understand the composition of the respiratory mycobiome in critically ill COVID-19 patients with and without CAPA, the impact of antifungal use and its role in patient outcome.\n\nMethodsWe performed a multi-national study of 39 COVID-19 patients in intensive care units (ICU) with and without CAPA. Respiratory mycobiome was profiled using ITS1 sequencing and Aspergillus fumigatus burden was further validated using qPCR. Fungal communities were investigated using alpha diversity, beta diversity, taxa prevalence and taxa abundances.\n\nResultsRespiratory mycobiomes were dominated by Candida and Aspergillus. There was no significant association with corticosteroid use or CAPA diagnosis and respiratory fungal communities. Increased A. fumigatus burden was associated with mortality. The use of antifungals at ICU admission was associated with an absence of A. fumigatus.\n\nConclusionsOur findings suggest that systemic antifungal treatment at ICU admission may be protective against A. fumigatus-associated mortality in CAPA.",

    "abstract": "A prominent oral commensal and opportunistic pathogen, Fusobacterium nucleatum can traverse to extra-oral sites such as placenta and colon, promoting adverse pregnancy outcomes and colorectal cancer, respectively. How this anaerobe sustains many metabolically changing environments enabling its virulence potential remains unclear. Informed by our genome-wide transposon mutagenesis, we report here that the highly conserved Rnf complex, encoded by the rnfCDGEAB gene cluster, is key to fusobacterial metabolic adaptation and virulence. Genetic disruption of the Rnf complex via non-polar, in-frame deletion of rnfC ({Delta}rnfC) abrogates polymicrobial interaction (or coaggregation) associated with adhesin RadD and biofilm formation. The defect in coaggregation is not due to reduced cell surface of RadD, but rather an increased level of extracellular lysine, which binds RadD and inhibits coaggregation. Indeed, removal of extracellular lysine via washing {Delta}rnfC cells restores coaggregation, while addition of lysine inhibits this process. These phenotypes mirror that of a mutant ({Delta}kamA) that fails to metabolize extracellular lysine. Strikingly, the {Delta}rnfC mutant is defective in ATP production, cell growth, cell morphology, and expression of the enzyme MegL that produces hydrogen sulfide from cysteine. Targeted metabolic profiling demonstrated that catabolism of many amino acids, including histidine and lysine, is altered in {Delta}rnfC cells, thereby reducing production of ATP and metabolites including H2S and butyrate. Most importantly, we show that the {Delta}rnfC mutant is severely attenuated in a mouse model of preterm birth. The indispensable function of Rnf complex in fusobacterial pathogenesis via modulation of bacterial metabolism makes it an attractive target for developing therapeutic intervention.\n\nIMPORTANCEAlthough viewed as an oral commensal, the Gram-negative F. nucleatum is an opportunistic pathogen that can spread to extra-oral sites such as placenta and colon, promoting adverse pregnancy outcomes and colorectal cancer, respectively. How this anaerobe sustains various metabolically changing environments enabling its virulence potential remains unclear. We demonstrate here that the highly conserved Rnf complex is key to fusobacterial metabolic adaptation and virulence. Genetic disruption of this Rnf complex causes global defects in polymicrobial interaction, biofilm formation, cell growth and morphology, H2S production, and ATP synthesis. Targeted metabolomic profiling demonstrates that the loss of this respiratory enzyme significantly diminishes catabolism of numerous amino acids, which negatively impacts fusobacterial virulence as tested in a preterm birth model in mice.",

    "abstract": "Babesiosis is an emerging zoonosis and widely distributed veterinary infection caused by 100+ species of Babesia parasites. The diversity of Babesia parasites, coupled with the lack of potent inhibitors necessitates the discovery of novel conserved druggable targets for the generation of broadly effective antibabesials. Here, we describe a comparative chemogenomics (CCG) pipeline for the identification of novel and conserved targets. CCG relies on parallel in vitro evolution of resistance in independent populations of evolutionarily-related Babesia spp. (B. bovis and B. divergens). We identified a potent antibabesial inhibitor from the Malaria Box, MMV019266. We were able to select for resistance to this compound in two species of Babesia, achieving 10-fold or greater resistance after ten weeks of intermittent selection. After sequencing of multiple independently derived lines in the two species, we identified mutations in a single conserved gene in both species: a membrane-bound metallodependent phosphatase (putatively named PhoD). In both species, the mutations were found in the phoD-like phosphatase domain, proximal to the predicted ligand binding site. Using reverse genetics, we validated that mutations in PhoD confer resistance to MMV019266. We have also demonstrated that PhoD localizes to the endomembrane system and partially with the apicoplast. Finally, conditional knockdown and constitutive overexpression of PhoD alter the sensitivity to MMV019266 in the parasite: overexpression of PhoD results in increased sensitivity to the compound, while knockdown increases resistance, suggesting PhoD is a resistance mechanism. Together, we have generated a robust pipeline for identification of resistance loci, and identified PhoD as a novel determinant of resistance in Babesia species.\n\nHighlightsO_LIUse of two species for in vitro evolution identifies a high confidence locus associated with resistance\nC_LIO_LIResistance mutation in phoD was validated using reverse genetics in B. divergens\nC_LIO_LIPerturbation of phoD using function genetics results in changes in the level of resistance to MMV019266\nC_LIO_LIEpitope tagging reveals localization to the ER/apicoplast, a conserved localization with a similar protein in diatoms\nC_LIO_LITogether, phoD is a novel resistance determinant in multiple Babesia spp.\nC_LI",
