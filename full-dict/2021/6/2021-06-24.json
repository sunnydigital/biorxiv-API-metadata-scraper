    "abstract": "Familial British and Danish dementia (FBD and FDD) are two neurodegenerative disorders caused by mutations in the Integral membrane protein 2B (ITM2b). BRI2, the protein encoded by ITM2b, tunes excitatory synaptic transmission at both pre- and post-synaptic terminus. Too, BRI2 interacts with and modulates proteolytic processing of Amyloid-{beta} precursor Protein (APP), whose mutations cause familial forms of Alzheimer disease (FAD). To study pathogenic mechanism triggered by the Danish mutation we generated rats carrying the Danish mutation into the rat Itm2b gene (Itm2bD rats). Given the BRI2/APP interaction and the widely accepted relevance of human A{beta}, a proteolytic product of APP, to AD, Itm2bD rats were engineered to express two humanized App alleles, to produce human A{beta}. Here, we studied young Itm2bD rats to investigate early pathogenic changes. We found that peri-adolescent Itm2bD rats present subtle changes in human A{beta} levels along with decreased spontaneous glutamate release and AMPAR-mediated responses but increased short-term synaptic facilitation in the hippocampal Schaeffer-collateral pathway. These changes are like those observed in adult mice producing rodent A{beta} and carrying either the Danish or British mutations into the mouse Itm2b gene. Collectively, the data show that the pathogenic Danish mutation alters the physiological function of BRI2 at glutamatergic synapses; these functional alterations are detected across species and occur early in life. Future studies will be needed to determine whether this phenomenon represents an early pathogenic event in human dementia.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic heart disease is globally the leading cause of death. It plays a central role in the electrical and structural remodeling of the right atrium, predisposing to arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden death. Here, we provide the first dissection of the gene expression changes in the live right atrial tissue, using single-nuclei RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics. We investigate matched samples of the tissue and pericardial fluid and reveal substantial differences in disease- associated gene expression in all cell types, leading to inflammatory microvascular dysfunction and changes in the tissue composition. Our study demonstrates the importance of creating high- resolution cellular maps and partitioning disease signals beyond epicardial coronary arteries and ischemic left ventricle to identify candidate mechanisms leading to more severe types of human cardiovascular disease.\n\nOne-Sentence SummarySingle-cell dissection of ex vivo heart biopsies and pericardial fluid in ischemic heart disease and heart failure",

    "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) - plasma membrane (PM) contacts are sites of lipid exchange and Ca2+ transport, and both lipid transport proteins and Ca2+ channels specifically accumulate at these locations. In pancreatic {beta}-cells, both lipid- and Ca2+ signaling are essential for insulin secretion. The recently characterized lipid transfer protein TMEM24 dynamically localize to ER-PM contact sites and provide phosphatidylinositol, a precursor of PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2, to the plasma membrane. {beta}-cells lacking TMEM24 exhibit markedly suppressed glucose-induced Ca2+ oscillations and insulin secretion but the underlying mechanism is not known. We now show that TMEM24 only weakly interact with the PM, and dissociates in response to both diacylglycerol and nanomolar elevations of cytosolic Ca2+. Release of TMEM24 into the bulk ER membrane also enables direct interactions with mitochondria, and we report that loss of TMEM24 results in excessive accumulation of Ca2+ in both the ER and mitochondria and in impaired mitochondria function.",

    "abstract": "Birth defects result from interactions between genetic and environmental factors, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We find that mutations and teratogens interact in predictable ways to cause birth defects by changing target cell sensitivity to Hedgehog (Hh) ligands. These interactions converge on a membrane protein complex, the MMM complex, that promotes degradation of the Hh transducer Smoothened (SMO). Deficiency of the MMM component MOSMO results in elevated SMO and increased Hh signaling, causing multiple birth defects. In utero exposure to a teratogen that directly inhibits SMO reduces the penetrance and expressivity of birth defects in Mosmo-/- embryos. Additionally, tissues that develop normally in Mosmo-/- embryos are refractory to the teratogen. Thus, changes in the abundance of the protein target of a teratogen can change birth defect outcomes by quantitative shifts in Hh signaling. Consequently, small molecules that re-calibrate signaling strength could be harnessed to rescue structural birth defects.",

    "abstract": "Azoles, the most commonly used antifungal drugs, specifically inhibit the fungal lanosterol -14 demethylase enzyme, which is referred to as Erg11. Inhibition of Erg11 ultimately leads to a reduction in ergosterol production, an essential fungal membrane sterol. Many Candida species, such as Candida albicans, develop mutations in this enzyme which reduces the azole binding affinity and results in increased resistance. Candida glabrata is also a pathogenic yeast that has low intrinsic susceptibility to azole drugs and easily develops elevated resistance. These azole resistant mutations typically cause hyperactivity of the Pdr1 transcription factor and rarely lie within the ERG11 gene. Here, we generated C. glabrata ERG11 mutations that were analogous to azole resistance alleles from C. albicans ERG11. Three different Erg11 forms (Y141H, S410F, and the corresponding double mutant (DM)) conferred azole resistance in C. glabrata with the DM Erg11 form causing the strongest phenotype. The DM Erg11 also induced cross-resistance to amphotericin B and caspofungin. Resistance caused by the DM allele of ERG11 imposed a fitness cost that was not observed with hyperactive PDR1 alleles. Crucially, the presence of the DM ERG11 allele was sufficient to activate the Pdr1 transcription factor in the absence of azole drugs. Our data indicate that azole resistance linked to changes in ERG11 activity can involve cellular effects beyond an alteration in this key azole target enzyme. Understanding the physiology linking ergosterol biosynthesis with Pdr1-mediated regulation of azole resistance is crucial for ensuring the continued efficacy of azole drugs against C. glabrata.\n\nImportanceAzole drugs target the Erg11 enzyme and lead to a reduction in fungal ergosterol, a vital sterol in yeast. Mutations in Erg11 are common among azole resistant Candida albicans clinical isolates, but not in C. glabrata, a major human pathogen. In this study, we showed that ERG11 mutations were tolerated in C. glabrata, and these mutations could confer azole resistance. We found that the strongest azole-resistant allele of ERG11 led to induction of the Pdr1 transcription factor and Cdr1 ATP-binding cassette transporter protein in the absence of drug. ERG11 mutations can cause azole resistance via altered enzymatic properties but also by triggering induction of other resistance systems owing to impacts on ergosterol biosynthesis. These data illustrate the deep connections between ergosterol biosynthesis and regulation of membrane transporter proteins via Pdr1 and the ergosterol-responsive transcription factor Upc2A.",

    "abstract": "Golgi-resident bisphosphate nucleotidase 2 (BPNT2) is a member of a family of magnesium-dependent/lithium-inhibited phosphatases that share a three-dimensional structural motif that directly coordinates metal binding to effect phosphate hydrolysis. BPNT2 is responsible for the breakdown of 3-phosphoadenosine-5-phosphate (PAP), a by-product of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) sulfation. Disruption of BPNT2 in mice leads to skeletal abnormalities due to impaired GAG sulfation, especially chondroitin-4-sulfation. Mutations in BPNT2 have also been found to underlie a chondrodysplastic disorder in humans. The precise mechanism by which loss of BPNT2 impairs sulfation remains unclear. Here, we utilize an in vitro approach using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to test the hypothesis that catalytic activity of BPNT2 is required for GAG sulfation. We show that a catalytic-dead Bpnt2 construct (D108A) does not rescue impairments in intracellular or secreted sulfated GAG, including decreased chondroitin-4-sulfate, present in Bpnt2-knockout MEFs. We also demonstrate that missense mutations in Bpnt2 which are adjacent to the catalytic site (and known to cause chondrodysplasia in humans) recapitulate defects in overall GAG sulfation and chondroitin-4-sulfation in MEF cultures. We further show that treatment of MEFs with lithium inhibits GAG sulfation, and that this effect depends on the presence of BPNT2. This work demonstrates that the catalytic activity of an enzyme potently inhibited by lithium can modulate GAG sulfation and therefore extracellular matrix composition, revealing new insights into lithium pharmacology and the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders responsive to lithium.",

    "abstract": "The assembly of proteins in a programmable manner provides insight into the underlying mechanisms of protein self-assembly in nature as well as the creation of novel functional nanomaterials for practical applications. Despite many advances, however, a rational protein assembly with an easy scalability in terms of size and valency remains a challenging task. Here, we present a simple bottom-up approach to the supramolecular protein assembly with a tunable size and valency in a programmable manner. The dendrimer-like protein assembly, called a \"prodrimer,\" was constructed using a total of three monomeric proteins: a core and two building-block proteins. The prodrimer generations were grown by a stepwise and alternate addition of a building block using two pairs of orthogonal protein-peptide interactions, leading to a higher-generation prodrimer with a mega-dalton size and multi-valency. The valency of the prodrimers at the periphery was tunable with the generation, enabling a single-step functionalization. A second-generation prodrimer functionalized with a target-specific protein binder showed a three-order of magnitude increase in binding affinity compared to a monomeric counterpart due to the avidity. The prodrimers functionalized with a targeting moiety and a cytotoxic protein cargo exhibited a highly enhanced cellular cytotoxicity, exemplifying their utility as a protein delivery platform. The present approach can be effectively used in the creation of protein architectures with new functions for biotechnological and medical applications.",

    "abstract": "The calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel, composed of the Orai channel and the STIM protein, plays a crucial role in maintaining the Ca2+ concentration in cells. Previous studies showed that the L138F mutation in the human Orai1 creates a constitutively open channel independent of STIM, causing severe myopathy, but how the L138F mutation activates Orai1 is still unclear. Here, based on the crystal structure of Drosophila melanogaster Orai (dOrai), molecular dynamics simulations for the wild-type (WT) and the L210F (corresponding to L138F in the human Orai1) mutant were conducted to investigate their structural and dynamical properties. The results showed that the L210F dOrai mutant tends to have a more hydrated hydrophobic region (V174 to F171), as well as more dilated basic region (K163 to R155) and selectivity filter (E178). Sodium ions were located deeper in the mutant than in the WT. Further analysis revealed two local but essential conformational changes that may be the key to the activation. A rotation of F210, a previously undescribed feature, was found to result in the opening of the K163 gate through hydrophobic interactions. At the same time, a counter-clockwise rotation of F171 occurred more frequently in the mutant, resulting in a wider hydrophobic gate with more hydration. Ultimately, the opening of the two gates may facilitate the opening of the Orai channel independent of STIM.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced hyper-inflammation links to the acute lung injury and COVID-19 severity. Identifying the primary mediators that initiate the uncontrolled hypercytokinemia is essential for treatments. Mast cells (MCs) are strategically located at the mucosa and beneficially or detrimentally regulate immune inflammations. Here we showed that SARS-CoV-2-triggeed MC degranulation initiated alveolar epithelial inflammation and lung injury. SARS-CoV-2 challenge induced MC degranulation in ACE-2 humanized mice and rhesus macaques, and a rapid MC degranulation could be recapitulated with Spike-RBD binding to ACE2 in cells; MC degranulation alterred various signaling pathways in alveolar epithelial cells, particularly, led to the production of pro-inflammatory factors and consequential disruption of tight junctions. Importantly, the administration of clinical MC stabilizers for blocking degranulation dampened SARS-CoV-2-induced production of pro-inflammatory factors and prevented lung injury. These findings uncover a novel mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 initiating lung inflammation, and suggest an off-label use of MC stabilizer as immunomodulators for COVID-19 treatments.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=135 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/449680v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@899996org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c26c0eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1442cdcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dd4204_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG In BriefSARS-CoV-2 triggers an immediate mast cell (MC) degranulation, which initiates the alveolar epithelial inflammation and disrupts the tight junction.

Still, the subcellular localization of the corona virus in lungs of COVID-19 patients is not well understood. Here, the localization of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins is studied in postmortem lung material of COVID-19 patients and in SARS- CoV-2 infected Vero cells, processed identically. Correlative light and electron microscopy on semi- thick cryo-sections, demonstrated induction of electron-lucent, lipid filled compartments after SARS- CoV-2 infection in both lung and cell cultures. In lung tissue, the non-structural protein 4 and the stable nucleocapsid N-protein, were detected on these novel lipid filled compartments. The induction of such lipid filled compartments and the localization of the viral proteins in lung of patients with fatal COVID-19, may explain the extensive inflammatory response and provide a new hallmark for SARS- Cov-2 infection at the final, fatal stage of infection.",

    "abstract": "Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has been identified as key host cell factor for viral entry and pathogenesis of SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Specifically, TMPRSS2 proteolytically processes the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) Protein, enabling virus-host membrane fusion and infection of the lungs. We present here an efficient recombinant production strategy for enzymatically active TMPRSS2 ectodomain enabling enzymatic characterization, and the 1.95 [A] X-ray crystal structure. To stabilize the enzyme for co-crystallization, we pre-treated TMPRSS2 with the synthetic protease inhibitor nafamosat to form a stable but slowly reversible (15 hour half-life) phenylguanidino acyl-enzyme complex. Our study provides a structural basis for the potent but non-specific inhibition by nafamostat and identifies distinguishing features of the TMPRSS2 substrate binding pocket that will guide future generations of inhibitors to improve selectivity. TMPRSS2 cleaved recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein ectodomain at the canonical S1/S2 cleavage site and at least two additional minor sites previously uncharacterized. We established enzymatic activity and inhibition assays that enabled ranking of clinical protease inhibitors with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 1.7 nM to 120 M and determination of inhibitor mechanisms of action. These results provide a body of data and reagents to support future drug development efforts to selectively inhibit TMPRSS2 and other type 2 transmembrane serine proteases involved in viral glycoprotein processing, in order to combat current and future viral threats.\n\nSUMMARY PARAGRAPHViruses hijack the biochemical activity of host proteins for viral invasion and replication. Transmembrane protease, serine-2 (TMPRSS2) is a surface-expressed protease implicated in the activation of influenza A, influenza B, and coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, to drive efficient infection of the lungs1-5. TMPRSS2 is an attractive target for antiviral therapies, as inhibiting its proteolytic activity blocks efficient viral entry5,6. However, a structural and biochemical understanding of the protease has remained elusive and no selective inhibitors are available. We engineered on-demand activatable TMPRSS2 ectodomain and determined the 1.95 [A] X-ray crystal structure of the stabilized acyl-enzyme after treatment with nafamostat, a protease inhibitor under investigation as a COVID-19 therapeutic. The structure reveals unique features of the TMPRSS2 substrate recognition pocket and domain architecture, and explains the potent, but nonselective inhibition by nafamostat. TMPRSS2 efficiently cleaved the SARS-CoV-2 S protein at the canonical S1/S2 site as well as two minor sites previously uncharacterized. We further established a robust enzymatic assay system and characterized inhibition by two additional clinical protease inhibitors under study for COVID-19, camostat and bromhexine. Our results provide a body of data and reagents to enable ongoing drug development efforts to selectively inhibit TMPRSS2 and other TTSPs involved in viral glycoprotein processing, in order to combat current and future viral threats.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV2 mutants emerge as variants of concern (VOC) due to altered selection pressure and rapid replication kinetics. Among them, lineages B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 contain a key mutation N501Y. B.1.135 and P.1 lineages have another mutation, E484K. Here, we decode the effect of these two mutations on the host receptor, ACE2, and neutralizing antibody (B38) recognition. The gain in binding affinity for the N501Y RBD mutant to the ACE2 is attributed to improved {pi}-{pi} stacking and {pi}-cation interactions. The enhanced receptor affinity of the E484K mutant is caused due to the formation of a specific hydrogen bond and salt-bridge interaction with Glu75 of ACE2. Notably, both the mutations reduce the binding affinity for B38 due to the loss of several hydrogen-bonding interactions. The insights obtained from the study are crucial to interpret the increased transmissibility and reduction in the neutralization efficacy of rapidly emerging SARS-CoV2 VOCs.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is responsible for millions of deaths around the world. To help contribute to the understanding of crucial knowledge and to further generate new hypotheses relevant to SARS-CoV-2 and human protein interactions, we make use of the information abundant Biomine probabilistic database and extend the experimentally identified SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network in silico. We generate an extended network by integrating information from the Biomine database, the PPI network, and other experimentally validated results. To generate novel hypotheses, we focus on the high-connectivity sub-communities that overlap most with the integrated experimentally validated results in the extended network. Therefore, we propose a new data analysis pipeline that can efficiently compute core decomposition on the extended network and identify dense subgraphs. We then evaluate the identified dense subgraph and the generated hypotheses in three contexts: literature validation for uncovered virus targeting genes and proteins, gene function enrichment analysis on subgraphs, and literature support on drug repurposing for identified tissues and diseases related to COVID-19. The majority types of the generated hypotheses are proteins with their encoding genes and we rank them by sorting their connections to the integrated experimentally validated nodes. In addition, we compile a comprehensive list of novel genes, and proteins potentially related to COVID-19, as well as novel diseases which might be comorbidities. Together with the generated hypotheses, our results provide novel knowledge relevant to COVID-19 for further validation.",

    "abstract": "Factors related to increasing globalization and climate change have contributed to the simultaneous increase and spread of arboviral diseases. Co-circulation of multiple arboviruses in the same geographic regions provides impetus to study the impacts of multiple arbovirus infections in a single vector. In the present study we describe co-infection and super-infection with Mayaro virus (Family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus) and Zika virus (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) in vertebrate cells, mosquito cells, and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to understand the interaction dynamics of these pathogens and effects on viral infection, dissemination and transmission. In Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, co-infection has a negative impact on infection and dissemination rates for Zika virus, but not Mayaro virus, when compared to single infection scenarios, and super-infection of Mayaro virus with a previous Zika virus infection resulted in increased Mayaro virus infection rates. We found that co-infection and super-infection negatively affected Zika viral replication in vertebrate cells (Vero and Huh), resulting in the complete blockage of Zika virus replication in some scenarios. At the cellular level, we demonstrate that single vertebrate and insect cells can be simultaneously infected with Zika and Mayaro viruses. This study highlights the dynamics of arboviral co- and super-infections and emphasizes the importance of considering these dynamics during risk assessment in epidemic areas.",

Tissues and mucosal scraping from the same locations showed closely related results while different gut tissues from the same animal varied widely. Picornavirus reads were generally more abundant in the lower digestive tract, particularly in the descending (distal) colon. Parvoviruses were more abundant in the upper reach particularly in the stomach. In situ hydridization (ISH) of fixed tissues showed punctuated staining for both these RNA and DNA viruses in the distal colon.

While some microbes depend on exchanges of essential nutrients for growth, forces driving the extensive cross-feeding needed to support the coexistence of free-living microbes are poorly understood. Here we characterize bacterial physiology under self-acidification, and establish that extensive excretion of key metabolites following acidification provides a collaborative, inter-species mechanism of stress resistance. This collaboration occurs not only between species isolated from the same community, but also between unrelated species with complementary (glycolytic vs. gluconeogenic) modes of metabolism. Cultures of such communities cycle through different phases in growth-dilution experiments, comprising of exponential growth, growth arrest upon acidification, collaborative stress relief, and growth recovery, with each phase involving distinct physiological states of individual species. Our findings challenge the static view of ecosystems commonly portrayed in ecological models, and offer an alternative dynamical view based on growth advantages of different species in different phases.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas are adaptive immune systems that protect their hosts against viruses and other parasitic mobile genetic elements. Consequently, selection from viruses and other genetic parasites is often assumed to drive the acquisition and maintenance of these immune systems in nature, but this remains untested. Here, we analyse the abundance of CRISPR arrays in natural environments using metagenomic datasets from 332 terrestrial, aquatic and host-associated ecosystems. For each metagenome we quantified viral abundance and levels of viral community diversity to test whether these variables can explain variation in CRISPR-Cas abundance across ecosystems. We find a strong positive correlation between CRISPR-Cas abundance and viral abundance. In addition, when controlling for differences in viral abundance, we found that the CRISPR-Cas systems are more abundant when viral diversity is low. We also found differences in relative CRISPR-Cas abundance among environments, with environmental classification explaining [~]24% of variation in CRISPR-Cas abundance. However, the correlations with viral abundance and diversity are broadly consistent across diverse natural environments. These results indicate that viral abundance and diversity are major ecological factors that drive the selection and maintenance of CRISPR-Cas in microbial ecosystems.\n\nSignificance statementNumerous studies demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas immune systems can provide defence against bacteriophage and archaeal viruses, yet little is known about the ecological conditions where CRISPR-Cas immunity is favoured. Moreover, our knowledge is largely confined to laboratory studies and it is unknown if viruses are a key selective driver of CRISPR-Cas in nature. Using metagenomic data from diverse environments we find that both viral abundance and the abundance of CRISPR-Cas immune systems correlate positively across most environments. Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas systems are more prevalent when viral diversity is low. These results extend previous theoretical work by demonstrating that viruses are a key driver of selection of CRISPR-Cas immune systems across many natural ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Changes in gene expression are a hallmark of learning and memory consolidation. Little is known about how alternative mRNA processing, particularly abundant in neuron-specific genes, contributes to these processes. Prototype RNA binding proteins of the neuronally expressed ELAV/Hu family are candidates for roles in learning and memory, but their capacity to cross-regulate and take over each others functions complicate substantiation of such links. Therefore, we focused on honey bees, which have only a single elav family gene. We find that honey bee elav contains a microexon, which is evolutionary conserved between invertebrates and humans. RNAi knockdown of elav demonstrates that ELAV is required for learning and memory in bees. Indicative of a role as immediate early gene, ELAV is dynamically expressed with altered alternative splicing and subcellular localization in mushroom bodies, but not in other brain parts. Expression and alternative splicing of elav change during memory consolidation illustrating an alternative mRNA processing program as part of a local gene expression response underlying memory formation. Although the honey bee genome encodes only a single elav gene, functional diversification is achieved by alternative splicing.",

Double-mutant flies lack cOMe but are viable. Consistent with prominent neuronal expression, they have a reward learning defect that can be rescued by conditional expression in mushroom body neurons before training.

    "abstract": "Effective vaccination against the influenza virus remains a challenge because of antigenic shift and drift in influenza viruses. Conservation is an important feature of the Nucleoprotein (NP) and Matrix protein 1(M1) qualifying them as potential candidates for developing a universal vaccine against the influenza A virus. Carliticulin (CRT), a member of heat shock protein (HSP) family, are conserved and widely distributed in many microorganisms and mammalian cells. In this study, a plasmid vector encoding the NP-M1-CRT sequence was constructed and compared with the NP-M1 sequence with respect to immunogenicity and protective efficacy in a murine model. The potency of the created construct for provoking humoral, cellular immune responses, and its protective immunity against the lethal influenza virus infection were then compared with commercial split vaccine and then evaluated in a murine model system. NP-M1-CRT as a DNA vaccine combined with in vivo electroporation could significantly improve the immunogenicity of constructed vectors. Serological evaluations demonstrated the potency of our approach to provoke strong anti-NP specific antibody responses. Furthermore, our strategy of immunization in prime-boost groups were able to provide protection against lethal viral challenge using H1N1 subtype. The ease of production of these types of vectors and the fact that they would not require annual updating and manufacturing may provide an alternative cost-effective approach to limit the spread of potential pandemic influenza viruses.",

    "abstract": "In June 2013, the first case of human infection with an avian H6N1 virus was reported in a Taiwanese woman. Although this was a single non-fatal case, the virus continues to circulate in Taiwanese poultry. As with any emerging avian virus that infects humans, there is concern that acquisition of human-type receptor specificity could enable transmission in the human population. Despite mutations in the receptor-binding pocket of the human H6N1 isolate, it has retained avian-type (NeuAca2-3Gal) receptor specificity.\n\nAn H6N1 AIV was isolated from a Von Schrencks Bittern during national active surveillance project for avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in wild birds in Jiangxi province, China 2018. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this strain received its genes from H1, H2, H3, H4, H6 and H10 AIVs in different places. This strain was found to be minimally pathogenic in mice and was able to replicate in mice without prior adaptation. Considering that the reassorted H6N1 virus was isolated from Von Schrencks Bittern in this study, it is possible that this bird can play an important role in the generation of novel reassorted H6 AIVs.\n\nIn this study, H6N1 virus is a wild virus migration brought from different regions of the AIV gene into the natural gene pool, resulting in the production of a recombinant new virus. The H6N1 virus can be seen as a link in the evolution of the virus and the evolution of other viruses.",

To overcome the weak regenerative capacity of mammals, we used regeneration-prone zebrafish to study {beta}-cells arising following destruction. We show that most new insulin cells differ from the original {beta}-cells as they are Somatostatin+ Insulin+, but are nevertheless functional and normalize glycemia. These bihormonal cells are transcriptionally close to a subset of {delta}-cells in normal islets characterized by the expression of somatostatin 1.1 (sst1.1), the {beta}-cell genes pdx1, slc2a2 and gck, and the machinery for glucose-induced Insulin secretion. {beta}-cell destruction triggers massive sst1.1 {delta}-cell conversion to bihormonal cells. Our work shows that their pro- {beta}-cell identity predisposes this zebrafish {delta}-cell subpopulation to efficient age-independent neogenesis of Insulin-producing cells and provides clues to restoring functional {beta}-cells in mammalian diabetes models.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionInsulin is a peptide hormone that is secreted by the {beta} cells of the pancreas and is essential to the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in the body. The marmoset insulin peptide is not homologous with human insulin and therefore commonly available assays do not work for this species. Due to the increasing popularity of marmoset research, a simple, specific assay for the quantitation of marmoset insulin is needed. This study aimed to develop and validate a bottom-up proteomic workflow with trypsin digestion and analysis using LC coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).\n\nMethodsMarmoset serum proteins were subjected to denaturation, reduction, and enzymatic cleavage to extract a unique, 7 amino acid peptide for quantitation of marmoset insulin.Resolution of the peptide was achieved by LC-MS/MS using electrospray ionization operating in positive mode. Calibration was achieved by aliquot dilution of fully synthetic marmoset insulin tryptic peptide into macaque serum. A stable-isotope labeled (13C, 15N) synthetic marmoset insulin tryptic peptide was used as internal standard.\n\nResultsThe assay was fully validated according to bioanalytical method validation guidelines for linearity, precision, and dilution linearity using purified marmoset insulin. The limit of detection was 4.28 pmol/L and the limit of quantitation was 8.62 pmol/L. Biological validation was achieved by comparison of samples previously run by radioimmunoassay and measurement of the marmoset insulin response to glucose via an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The physiological range of marmoset insulin was shown to be 84.5 to 1222 pmol/L.\n\nConclusionsThis paper presents a simple, reproducible method to measure marmoset insulin using LC-MS/MS.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin remodeler ALC1 (amplification in liver cancer 1) is crucial for repairing damaged DNA. It is autoinhibited and activated by nucleosomal epitopes. However, the mechanisms by which ALC1 is regulated remain unclear. Here we report the crystal structure of human ALC1 and the cryoEM structure bound to the nucleosome. The structure shows the macro domain of ALC1 binds to lobe 2 of the ATPase motor, sequestering two elements for nucleosome recognition, explaining the autoinhibition mechanism of the enzyme. The H4 tail competes with the macro domain for lobe 2-binding, explaining the requirement for this nucleosomal epitope for ALC1 activation. A dual-arginine-anchor motif of ALC1 recognizes the acidic pocket of the nucleosome, which is critical for chromatin remodeling in vitro. Together, our findings illustrate the structures of ALC1 and shed light on its regulation mechanisms, paving the way for the discovery of drugs targeting ALC1 for the treatment of cancer.",

    "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by germline variants in the diacylglycerol (DG)/Ca2+-regulated protein kinase C gamma (PKC{gamma}), leading to Purkinje cell degeneration and progressive cerebellar dysfunction. The majority of the approximately 50 identified variants cluster to the DG-sensing C1 domains. Here, we use a FRET- based activity reporter to show that ataxia-associated PKC{gamma} mutations enhance basal activity by compromising autoinhibition. Although impaired autoinhibition generally leads to PKC degradation, the C1 domain mutations protect PKC{gamma} from phorbol ester-induced downregulation. Furthermore, it is the degree of disrupted autoinhibition, not changes in the amplitude of agonist- stimulated activity, that correlate with disease severity. This enhanced basal signaling rewires the brain phosphoproteome, as assessed by phosphoproteomic analysis of cerebella from mice expressing a human PKC{gamma} transgene harboring a SCA14 C1 domain mutation, H101Y. Validating that the pathology arises from disrupted autoinhibition, we show that the degree of impaired autoinhibition correlates inversely with age of disease onset in patients: mutations that cause high basal activity are associated with early onset, whereas those that only modestly increase basal activity, including a previously undescribed variant, D115Y, are associated with later onset. Molecular modeling indicates that almost all SCA14 variants that are not in the C1 domains are at interfaces with the C1B domain, and bioinformatics analysis reveals that variants in the C1B domain are under-represented in cancer. Thus, clustering of SCA14 variants to the C1B domain provides a unique mechanism to enhance PKC{gamma} basal activity while protecting the enzyme from downregulation, deregulating the cerebellar phosphoproteome.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySCA14 driver mutations in PKC{gamma} impair autoinhibition, with defect correlating inversely with age of disease onset.",

    "abstract": "Human gut microbial communities have a tremendous impact on well-being of the human health by producing myriad of metabolites. Polysaccharide utilizing capability of these microbial communities is a key driving force in shaping the composition of gut microbiota. Previous studies suggest that genes responsible for {beta}- glucans utilizing in Bacteroides are present in a polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL). However, recent observations show that Bacteroides uniformis lacks such PUL archetypal organisation for efficient utilization of pustulan ({beta}1-6) and mixed linkage ({beta}1-4/ {beta}1-3) glucans, and its mechanism is yet to be studied. Here, we first used BuGH16 for production of important two mixed linked {beta}- glucan-oligosaccharides, and then demonstrate kinetics of the BuGH3MLG. The B. uniformis JCM13288T coordinates between PUL associated glycoside hydrolase (GH)-16 and distantly localised bespoke GH 3 (BuGH3MLG) for efficient utilization of mixed linkage ({beta}1-4/ {beta}1-3) glucans. BuGH3MLG found to be cleaved {beta}1-4, {beta}1-3 and {beta}1-6 glucan-oligosaccharides.

It is present in many eukaryotic and bacterial species, where it is part of the anticodon loop of certain tRNAs. In higher vertebrates, including humans, two further modified queuosine-derivatives exist - galactosyl-(galQ) and mannosyl-queuosine (manQ). The function of these low abundant hypermodified RNA nucleosides remains unknown. While the structure of galQ was elucidated and confirmed by total synthesis, the reported structure of manQ still awaits confirmation. By combining total synthesis and LC-MS-co-injection, together with a metabolic feeding study of labelled hexoses, we show here that the natural compound manQ isolated from mouse liver deviates from the literature-reported structure. The chemical structure of the natural product manQ features a novel -allyl connectivity. The data reported here shows that the yet unidentified glycosylases that attach galactose and mannose to the Q-base have different constitutional connectivity preferences. Knowing the correct structure of manQ will now pave the way towards further elucidation of its biological function.",

The protein consists of an anti-glycophorin A nanobody and an erythropoietin mutant (L108A). The mutation reduces activation of erythropoietin receptor homodimers that induce erythropoiesis and thrombosis, but maintains the tissue-protective signaling. The binding of the nanobody element to glycophorin A rescues homodimeric erythropoietin receptor activation on red blood cell precursors. In a cell proliferation assay, the fusion protein is active at 10-14 M, allowing an estimate of the number of receptor-ligand complexes needed for signaling.

We demonstrate that genomic integration of expression cassettes for a pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS), pyrrolysyl-tRNA (PylT) and the target protein of interest enables site-specific incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) in response to amber stop codons.

The incorporated ncAA can serve as a minimal bioorthogonal handle for further modifications by labeling with fluorescent dyes.

Bd1075 localizes to the outer curved face of B. bacteriovorus, in contrast to most known shape-determinants. Asymmetric protein localization is determined by the novel function of a nuclear transport factor 2-like (NTF2) domain at the protein C-terminus. The solved structure of Bd1075 is monomeric, with key differences to other LD-carboxypeptidases. Rod-shaped {Delta}bd1075 mutants invade prey more slowly than curved wild-type predators, and stretch and deform the invaded prey cell from within. Vibrioid morphology increases the evolutionary fitness of wild predatory bacteria, facilitating efficient prey invasion and intracellular growth of curved predators inside a spherical prey niche.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear DNA damage is intricately linked to cellular metabolism. However, the underlying mechanisms and full range of metabolic alterations that occur in response to persistent DNA damage are not well understood. Here, we use a DNA repair-deficient model of ERCC1-XPF in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), that accumulates physiologically relevant, endogenous DNA damage, to gain molecular insights on how persistent genotoxic stress drives biological aging. Using an integrated multi-omic approach, we discover that persistent genotoxic stress rewires lipid metabolism. In particular, nuclear DNA damage promotes mitochondrial {beta}-oxidation and leads to a global loss of fat depots. This metabolic shift to {beta}-oxidation generates acetyl-CoA and drives histone hyperacetylation. Concomitantly, we observe an associated change in gene expression of immune-effector and cytochrome (CYP) genes. We identify MYS-1, the ortholog of mammalian histone acetyltransferase TIP60, as a critical regulator of this metabolic-epigenetic axis. Moreover, we show that in response to persistent DNA damage, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially arachidonic acid (AA) and AA-related lipid mediators are elevated. This elevation of PUFA species requires mys-1/Tip60. Together, these findings reveal that persistent nuclear DNA damage alters the metabolic-epigenetic axis to drive an immune-like response that can promote age-associated decline.",

    "abstract": "Regeneration-competent species possess the ability to reverse the progression of severe diseases by restoring the function of the damaged tissue. However, the cellular dynamics underlying this capability remain unexplored. Here, we use single-cell transcriptomics to map de novo {beta}-cell regeneration during induction and recovery from diabetes in zebrafish. We show that the zebrafish has evolved two distinct types of somatostatin-producing {delta}-cells, which we term {delta}1- and {delta}2-cells. Moreover, we characterize a small population of glucose-responsive islet cells, which share the hormones and fate-determinants of both {beta}- and {delta}1-cells. The transcriptomic analysis of {beta}-cell regeneration reveals that {beta}/{delta} hybrid cells constitute a prominent source of insulin-expression during diabetes recovery. Using in vivo calcium imaging and cell tracking, we further show that the hybrid cells form de novo and acquire glucose-responsiveness in the course of regeneration. The overexpression of dkk3, a gene enriched in hybrid cells, increases their formation in the absence of {beta}-cell injury. Finally, interspecies comparison shows that plastic {delta}1-cells are partially related to PP-cells in the human pancreas. Our work provides an atlas of {beta}-cell regeneration and indicates that the rapid formation of glucose-responsive hybrid cells contributes to the resolution of diabetes in zebrafish",

This xenobiotic exerts a time-dependent effect over P. caudatum survival, which may be a consequence of impairments to multiple core cellular functions. We discuss the potential use of this ciliate as a biosensor for environmental BPA and as a new model organism to study the general impacts of this plasticizer agent over Eukaryotes.

The viral large (L) protein, which contains the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is a key player for transcription of viral mRNA and genome replication. Here we present nine cryo-EM structures of Lassa virus L protein in the apo-, promoter-bound pre-initiation and active RNA synthesis states. We characterize distinct binding pockets for the conserved genomic 3 and 5 promoter RNAs and show how full-promoter binding induces a distinct pre-initiation conformation. In the apo- and elongation states, the endonuclease is inhibited by the binding of two distinct L protein peptides in the active site, respectively, whereas in the pre-initiation state, the endonuclease is uninhibited. In the stalled, early elongation state, a template-product duplex is bound in the active site cavity together with an incoming non-hydrolysable nucleotide. In this configuration, the full C-terminal region of the L protein, including the putative cap-binding domain, is highly ordered. The structural data are complemented by in vitro and cell-based studies testing a broad range of L protein mutants to probe functional relevance. These data advance our mechanistic understanding of how this flexible and multifunctional molecular machine is activated and will underpin antiviral drug development targeting the arenavirus L protein.",

    "abstract": "Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin is the most common cancer in humans, characterized by the highest mutation rate among cancers, and is mostly driven by mutations in genes involved in the hedgehog pathway. To date, almost all BCC genetic studies have focused exclusively on protein-coding sequences; therefore, the impact of noncoding variants on the BCC genome is unrecognized. In this study, with the use of whole-exome sequencing of 27 tumor/normal pairs of BCC samples, we performed an analysis of somatic mutations in both protein-coding sequences and gene-associated noncoding regions, including 5UTRs, 3UTRs, and exon-adjacent intron sequences. Separately, in each region, we performed hotspot identification, mutation enrichment analysis, and cancer driver identification with OncodriveFML. Additionally, we performed a whole-genome copy number alteration analysis with GISTIC2. Of the >80,000 identified mutations, [~]50% were localized in noncoding regions. The results of the analysis generally corroborated the previous findings regarding genes mutated in coding sequences, including PTCH1, TP53, and MYCN, but more importantly showed that mutations were also clustered in specific noncoding regions, including hotspots. Some of the genes specifically mutated in noncoding regions were identified as highly potent cancer drivers, of which BAD had a mutation hotspot in the 3UTR, DHODH had a mutation hotspot in the Kozak sequence in the 5UTR, and CHCHD2 frequently showed mutations in the 5UTR. All of these genes are functionally implicated in cancer-related processes (e.g., apoptosis, mitochondrial metabolism, and de novo pyrimidine synthesis) or the pathogenesis of UV radiation-induced cancers. We also found that the identified BAD and CHCHD2 mutations frequently occur in melanoma but not in other cancers via The Cancer Genome Atlas analysis. Finally, we identified frequent deletion of chr9q, encompassing PTCH1, and unreported frequent copy number gain of chr9p, encompassing the genes encoding the immune checkpoint ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. In conclusion, this study is the first systematic analysis of coding and noncoding mutations in BCC and provides a strong basis for further analyses of the variants in BCC and cancer in general.\n\nAuthor summaryThe study is the first systematic analysis of both coding and noncoding mutations in basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common and the most highly mutated human cancer. Noncoding mutations accounted for [~]50% ([~]40K mutations) of all mutations detected by the standard WES approach. Among the genes frequently mutated in noncoding regions are: BAD with a hotspot in the 3UTR, DHODH with a hotspot in the Kozak sequence, and CHCHD2 with mutations in 5UTR, all genes functionally related to cell metabolism and apoptosis. Analysis of copy number alterations showed frequent chr9q deletion, encompassing PTCH1 (the key BCC tumor suppressor), and frequent copy number gain of chr9p, encompassing the genes of the immune checkpoint proteins PD-L1 and PD-L2.",

    "abstract": "Modules in brain functional connectomes are essential to balancing segregation and integration of neuronal activity. Connectomes are the complete set of pairwise connections between brain regions. Non-invasive Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) have been used to identify modules in connectomes of phase-synchronization. However, their resolution is suboptimal because of spurious phase-synchronization due to EEG volume conduction or MEG field spread. Here, we used invasive, intracerebral recordings from stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG, N = 67), to identify modules in connectomes of phase-synchronization. To generate SEEG-based group-level connectomes affected only minimally by volume conduction, we used submillimeter accurate localization of SEEG contacts and referenced electrode contacts in cortical grey matter to their closest contacts in white matter. Combining community detection methods with consensus clustering, we found that the connectomes of phase-synchronization were characterized by distinct and stable modules at multiple spatial scales, across frequencies from 3 to 320 Hz. These modules were highly similar within canonical frequency bands. Unlike the distributed brain systems identified with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), modules up to the high-gamma frequency band comprised only anatomically contiguous regions. Notably, the identified modules comprised cortical regions involved in shared repertoires of sensorimotor and cognitive functions including memory, language and attention. These results suggest that the identified modules represent functionally specialised brain systems, which only partially overlap with the brain systems reported with fMRI. Hence, these modules might regulate the balance between functional segregation and functional integration through phase-synchronization.\n\nHighlightsO_LILarge-cohort SEEG used for phase-synchronization connectomics\nC_LIO_LIConnectomes of phase-synchronization possess distinct and stable modules\nC_LIO_LIModules in connectomes are highly similar within canonical frequency bands\nC_LIO_LIModules in connectomes comprise anatomically contiguous regions\nC_LIO_LIModules in connectomes comprise functionally related regions\nC_LI",

We investigated how similar networks are engaged when we produce, as well as comprehend, discourse. During fMRI, participants spoke about a series of specific topics and listened to discourse on other topics. We tested how activation was predicted by natural fluctuations in the global coherence of the discourse, i.e., the degree to which utterances conformed to the expected topic. The neural correlates of coherence were similar across speaking and listening, particularly in default mode regions. This network showed greater activation when less coherent speech was heard or produced, reflecting updating of mental representations when discourse did not conform to the expected topic. In contrast, regions that exert control over semantic activation showed task-specific effects, correlating negatively with coherence during listening but not during production. Participants who showed greater activation in left inferior prefrontal cortex also produced more coherent discourse, suggesting a specific role for this region in goal-directed regulation of speech content. Results suggest strong correspondence of discourse representations during speaking and listening.

    "abstract": "The cerebellum is hypothesized to represent timing information important for organizing salient motor events during periodically performed discontinuous movements. To provide functional evidence validating this idea, we measured and manipulated Purkinje cell (PC) activity in the lateral cerebellum of mice trained to volitionally elicit periodic bouts of stereotyped licking for regularly allocated water rewards. Overall, PC simple spiking modulated during task performance, ramping prior to both lick-bout initiation and termination, two important motor events delimiting movement cycles. The ramping onset occurred earlier for the initiation of un-cued exploratory licking that anticipated water availability relative to licking that was reactive to water allocation, suggesting that the cerebellum is engaged differently depending on the movement context. In a subpopulation of PCs, climbing-fiber-evoked responses also increased during lick-bout initiation, but not termination, highlighting differences in how cerebellar input pathways represent task-related information. Optogenetic perturbation of PC activity disrupted the behavior in both initiating and terminating licking bouts and reduced the ability of animals to finely time predictive action around reward delivery, confirming a causative role in movement organization. Together, these results substantiate that the cerebellum contributes to the control of explicitly timed repeated motor actions.",

    "abstract": "Many bacteria can migrate from a free-living, planktonic state to an attached, biofilm existence. One factor regulating this transition in the facultative plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the ExoR-ChvG-ChvI system. Periplasmic ExoR regulates activity of the ChvG-ChvI two-component system in response to environmental stress, most notably low pH. ChvI impacts hundreds of genes, including those required for type VI secretion, virulence, biofilm formation, and flagellar motility. Previous studies revealed that activated ChvG-ChvI represses expression of most of class II and class III flagellar biogenesis genes, but not the master motility regulators visN, visR, and rem. In this study, we characterized the integration of the ExoR-ChvG-ChvI and VisNR-Rem pathways. We isolated motile suppressors of the non-motile {Delta}exoR mutant and thereby identified the previously unannotated mirA gene encoding a 76 amino acid protein. We report that the MirA protein interacts directly with the Rem DNA-binding domain, sequestering Rem and preventing motility gene activation. The ChvG-ChvI pathway activates mirA expression and elevated mirA is sufficient to block motility. This study reveals how the ExoR-ChvG-ChvI pathway prevents flagellar motility in A. tumefaciens. MirA is also conserved among other members of the Rhizobiales suggesting similar mechanisms of motility regulation.\n\nPlain language summaryAgrobacterium tumefaciens is a plant pathogen that responds to low pH, stressful environments via a complex two-component regulatory system. This regulatory system can completely inhibit bacterial locomotion by flagella, and in this study we define the mechanism for this inhibition and identify a novel small protein regulator that blocks flagellar gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria have evolved to cope with the detrimental effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using their essential molecular components. Catalase, a heme-containing tetramer protein expressed universally in most of the aerobic bacteria, plays an indispensable role in scavenging excess hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here, through utilization of wild-type and catalase-deficient mutants, we identified catalase as an endogenous therapeutic target of 400-420 nm blue light. Catalase residing in bacteria could be effectively inactivated by blue light, subsequently rendering the pathogens extremely vulnerable to H2O2 and H2O2-producing agents. As a result, photoinactivation of catalase and H2O2 synergistically eliminate a wide range of catalase-positive planktonic bacteria and P. aeruginosa inside biofilms. In addition, photoinactivation of catalase is shown to facilitate macrophages to defend against intracellular pathogens. The antimicrobial efficacy of catalase photoinactivation is further validated using a Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced mice abrasion model. Taken together, our findings offer a catalase-targeting phototherapy against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.",

While evolutionary theory typically envisions geneflow as a continuous connection among populations, many processes make it fluctuating and intermittent. We analyze a mainland-island model in which migration occurs as recurrent \"pulses\". We derive mathematical predictions regarding how the level of migration pulsedness affects the effective migration rate, for neutral and selected mainland alleles. We find that migration pulsedness can either decrease or increase geneflow, depending on the selection regime. Migration increases gene-flow for sufficiently (counter)selected alleles (s < s1), but reduces it otherwise. We provide a mathematical approximation of the threshold selection s1, which is verified in stochastic simulations. Migration pulsedness thus affects the fixation rate at different loci in opposite ways, in a way that cannot be described as a change in effective population size. We show that migration pulsedness would generally reduce the level of local adaptation, and introduce an additional genetic load: the \"pulsedness load\". Our results indicate that migration pulsedness can be detrimental to the adaptation and persistence of small peripheral populations, with implications in management and conservation. Our results highlight temporally variable migration as an important process for evolutionary and population genetics.",

However, it has proven hard to interpret the consequences of experimental disruption of TADs or loop-extrusion on gene regulation3,6,10, in part because of the difficulty in distinguishing direct from indirect effects on enhancer-driven gene expression. By coupling acute protein degradation with synthetic activation by targeted transcription factor recruitment in mouse embryonic stem cells, here we show that cohesin, but not CTCF, is required for activation of a target gene by distant distal regulatory elements. Cohesin is not required for activation directly at the promoter or activation from an enhancer located closer to the gene. Our findings support the hypothesis that chromatin compaction mediated by cohesin-mediated loop extrusion allows for genes to be activated by regulatory elements that are located many hundreds of kilobases away in the linear genome but suggests that cohesin is dispensable for more genomically close enhancers.",

    "abstract": "The molecular determinants of tissue composition of the human brain remain largely unknown. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on this topic have had limited success due to methodological constraints. Here, we apply advanced whole-brain analyses on multi-shell diffusion imaging data and multivariate GWAS to two large scale imaging genetic datasets (UK Biobank and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study) to identify and validate genetic association signals. We discovered 503 unique genetic loci that have impact on multiple regions of human brain. Among them, more than 79% were validated in either of two large-scale independent imaging datasets. Key molecular pathways involved in axonal growth, astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation, and synaptogenesis during development were found to significantly impact the measured variations in tissue-specific imaging features. Our results shed new light on the biological determinants of brain tissue composition and their potential overlap with the genetic basis of neuropsychiatric disorders.",
