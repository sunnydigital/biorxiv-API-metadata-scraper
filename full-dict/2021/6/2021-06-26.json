    "abstract": "Differentiation involves bifurcations between discrete cell states, each defined by a distinct gene expression profile. Single-cell RNA profiling allows the detection of bifurcations. However, while current methods capture these events, they do not identify characteristic gene signals. Here we show that BioTIP - a tipping-point theory-based analysis - can accurately, robustly, and reliably identify critical transition signals (CTSs). A CTS is a small group of genes with high covariance in expression that mark the cells approaching a bifurcation. We validated its accuracy in the cardiogenesis with known a tipping point and demonstrated the identified CTSs contain verified differentiation-driving transcription factors. We then demonstrated the application on a published mouse gastrulation dataset, validated the predicted CTSs using independent in-vivo samples, and inferred the key developing mesoderm regulator Etv2. Taken together, BioTIP is broadly applicable for the characterization of the plasticity, heterogeneity, and rapid switches in developmental processes, particularly in single-cell data analysis.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIdentifying significant critical transition signals (CTSs) from expression noise\nC_LIO_LIA significant CTS contains or is targeted by key transcription factors\nC_LIO_LIBioTIP identifies CTSs accurately and independent of trajectory topologies\nC_LIO_LISignificant CTSs reproducibly indicate bifurcations across datasets\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing the behavior of extinct species is challenging, particularly for those with no living analogues. However, damage preserved as paleopathologies on bone can record how an animal moved in life, potentially reflecting behavioral patterns. Here, we assess hypothesized etiologies of pathology in a pelvis and associated right femur of a Smilodon fatalis saber-toothed cat, one of the best-studied species from the Pleistocene-age Rancho La Brea asphalt seeps, California, USA, using visualization by computed tomography (CT). The pelvis exhibits massive destruction of the right hip socket that was interpreted, for nearly a century, to have developed from trauma and infection. CT imaging reveals instead that the pathological distortions characterize chronic remodeling that began at birth and led to degeneration of the joint over the animals life. These results suggest that this individual suffered from hip dysplasia, a congenital condition common in domestic dogs and cats. This individual reached adulthood but could not have hunted properly nor defended territory on its own, likely relying on a social group for feeding and protection. While extant social felids are rare, these fossils and others with similar pathologies are consistent with a spectrum of social strategies in Smilodon supported by a predominance of previous studies.",

    "abstract": "Methods for electro- or magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) based brain source imaging (BSI) using sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) have been demonstrated to achieve excellent performance in situations with low numbers of distinct active sources, such as event-related designs. This paper extends the theory and practice of SBL in three important ways. First, we reformulate three existing SBL algorithms under the majorization-minimization (MM) framework. This unification perspective not only provides a useful theoretical framework for comparing different algorithms in terms of their convergence behavior, but also provides a principled recipe for constructing novel algorithms with specific properties by designing appropriate bounds of the Bayesian marginal likelihood function. Second, building on the MM principle, we propose a novel method called LowSNR-BSI that achieves favorable source reconstruction performance in low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) settings. Third, precise knowledge of the noise level is a crucial requirement for accurate source reconstruction. Here we present a novel principled technique to accurately learn the noise variance from the data either jointly within the source reconstruction procedure or using one of two proposed cross-validation strategies. Empirically, we could show that the monotonous convergence behavior predicted from MM theory is confirmed in numerical experiments. Using simulations, we further demonstrate the advantage of LowSNR-BSI over conventional SBL in low-SNR regimes, and the advantage of learned noise levels over estimates derived from baseline data. To demonstrate the usefulness of our novel approach, we show neurophysiologically plausible source reconstructions on averaged auditory evoked potential data.",

    "abstract": "Many enveloped viruses require the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) pathway to exit infected cells. This highly conserved pathway mediates essential cellular membrane fission events, which restricts the acquisition of adaptive mutations to counteract viral co-option. Here, we describe duplicated and truncated copies of the ESCRT-III factor CHMP3 that block ESCRT-dependent virus budding and that arose independently in New World monkeys and mice. When expressed in human cells, these retroCHMP3 proteins potently inhibit release of retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, and filoviruses. Remarkably, retroCHMP3 proteins have evolved to reduce interactions with other ESCRT-III factors and to have little effect on cellular ESCRT processes, revealing routes for decoupling cellular ESCRT functions from viral exploitation. The repurposing of duplicated ESCRT-III proteins thus provides a mechanism to generate broad-spectrum viral budding inhibitors without blocking highly conserved essential cellular ESCRT functions.",

We use genetics (GWAS-by-subtraction) to assess a latent, broad non-cognitive skills dimension. To index parental effects controlling for genetic transmission, we estimate indirect parental genetic effects of polygenic scores on childhood and adulthood educational outcomes, using siblings (N=47,459), adoptees (N=6,407), and parent-offspring trios (N=2,534) in three UK and Dutch cohorts. We find that parental cognitive and non-cognitive skills affect offspring education through their environment: on average across cohorts and designs, indirect genetic effects explain 36-40% of population polygenic score associations. However, indirect genetic effects are lower for achievement in the Dutch cohort, and for the adoption design. We identify causes of higher sibling- and trio-based estimates: prenatal indirect genetic effects, population stratification, and assortative mating. Our phenotype-agnostic, genetically sensitive approach has established overall environmental effects of parents skills, facilitating future mechanistic work.",

    "abstract": "The two visual streams hypothesis is a robust example of neural functional specialization that has inspired countless studies over the past four decades. According to one prominent version of the theory, the fundamental goal of the dorsal visual pathway is the transformation of retinal information for visually-guided motor behavior. To that end, the dorsal stream processes input using absolute (or veridical) metrics only when the movement is initiated, necessitating very little, or no, memory. Conversely, because the ventral visual pathway does not involve motor behavior (its output does not influence the real world), the ventral stream processes input using relative (or illusory) metrics and can accumulate or integrate sensory evidence over long time constants, which provides a substantial capacity for memory. In this study, we tested these relations between functional specialization, processing metrics, and memory by training identical recurrent neural networks to perform either a viewpoint-invariant object classification task or an orientation/size determination task. The former task relies on relative metrics, benefits from accumulating sensory evidence, and is usually attributed to the ventral stream. The latter task relies on absolute metrics, can be computed accurately in the moment, and is usually attributed to the dorsal stream. To quantify the amount of memory required for each task, we chose two types of neural network models. Using a long-short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent network, we found that viewpoint-invariant object categorization (object task) required a longer memory than orientation/size determination (orientation task). Additionally, to dissect this memory effect, we considered factors that contributed to longer memory in object tasks. First, we used two different sets of objects, one with self-occlusion of features and one without. Second, we defined object classes either strictly by visual feature similarity or (more liberally) by semantic label. The models required greater memory when features were self-occluded and when object classes were defined by visual feature similarity, showing that self-occlusion and visual similarity among object task samples are contributing to having a long memory. The same set of tasks modeled using modified leaky-integrator echo state recurrent networks (LiESN), however, did not replicate the results, except under some conditions. This may be because LiESNs cannot perform fine-grained memory adjustments due to their network-wide memory coefficient and fixed recurrent weights. In sum, the LSTM simulations suggest that longer memory is advantageous for performing viewpoint-invariant object classification (a putative ventral stream function) because it allows for interpolation of features across viewpoints. The results further suggest that orientation/size determination (a putative dorsal stream function) does not benefit from longer memory. These findings are consistent with the two visual streams theory of functional specialization.",

    "abstract": "The discovery and development of novel antiseizure drugs (ASDs) that are effective in controlling pharmacoresistant spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs) continues to represent a significant unmet clinical need. The Epilepsy Therapy Screening Program (ETSP) has undertaken efforts to address this need by adopting animal models that represent the salient features of human pharmacoresistant epilepsy and employing these models for preclinical testing of investigational ASDs. One such model that has garnered increased interest in recent years is the mouse variant of the Intra-Amygdala Kainate (IAK) microinjection model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). In establishing a version of this model, several methodological variables were evaluated for their effect(s) on pertinent quantitative endpoints. Although administration of a benzodiazepine 40 minutes after kainate (KA) induced status epilepticus (SE) is commonly used to improve survival, data presented here demonstrates similar outcomes (mortality, hippocampal damage, latency periods, and 90-day SRS natural history) between mice given midazolam and those that were not. Using a version of this model that did not interrupt SE with a benzodiazepine, a 90-day natural history study was performed and survival, latency periods, SRS frequencies and durations, and SRS clustering data were quantified. Finally, an important step towards model adoption is to assess the sensitivities or resistances of SRSs to a panel of approved and clinically used ASDs. Accordingly, the following ASDs were evaluated for their effects on SRSs in these mice: phenytoin (20 mg/kg, b.i.d.), carbamazepine (30 mg/kg, t.i.d.), valproate (240 mg/kg, t.i.d.), diazepam (4 mg/kg, b.i.d.), and phenobarbital (25 and 50 mg/kg, b.i.d.). Valproate, diazepam, and phenobarbital significantly attenuated SRS frequency relative to vehicle controls at doses devoid of observable adverse behavioral effects. Only diazepam significantly increased seizure freedom. Neither phenytoin nor carbamazepine significantly altered SRS frequency or freedom under these experimental conditions. These data demonstrate that SRSs in this IAK model of MTLE are pharmacoresistant to two representative sodium channel-inhibiting ASDs (phenytoin and carbamazepine) but not to GABA receptor modulating ASDs (diazepam and phenobarbital) or a mixed-mechanism ASD (valproate). Accordingly, this model is being incorporated into the NINDS-funded ETSP testing platform for treatment resistant epilepsy.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAn intra-amygdala kainate model of TLE was evaluated for pharmacoresistant seizures\nC_LIO_LIAdministration of midazolam during status epilepticus did not affect mortality\nC_LIO_LIModel characteristics were evaluated over a 90-day natural history study\nC_LIO_LISpontaneous seizures were resistant to phenytoin and carbamazepine\nC_LIO_LISpontaneous seizures were sensitive to valproic acid, diazepam, and phenobarbital\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Meat and dairy products in the food industry represent a significant portion of anthropogenic green house gas emissions. To meet the Intergovernemental Panel on Climate Change recommendations to limit global warming, these emissions should be reduced. Meat and dairy products are also responsible for the majority of our daily, vital, protein intake. Yet, meat and dairy products contain very different amounts of proteins, making it difficult in general to rationalize which protein source has the lowest carbon footprint. Here we present a practical and pedagogical review, comparing the carbon footprint of a variety of meat and dairy products with respect to their protein content. We investigate the carbon footprint of different dietary choices for several countries, by keeping the total number of meat and dairy proteins constant. Interestingly, we find that dairy-only diets are in general only a little less carbon intensive than current diets. However, 50% carbon footprint reduction may be obtained, throughout the world, with a \"low CO2\"-tailored diet including only small poultry, eggs and yogurt. Such a dietary pattern suggests easy to follow consumer guidelines for reduced carbon footprint. We report further on a number of consumer oriented questions (local or imported? organic or not? cow or goat milk? hard or soft cheese?). Our methodology may be applied to broader questions, such as the carbon footprint of proteins in general (including fish and plant proteins). We hope our work will drive more studies focusing on consumer-oriented questions.",

Although the four species engaged in negative interactions, they were able to stably coexist, both in vivo and in vitro. However, coexistence was only possible in the presence of pollen, and not in simple sugars, independent of the environment. Using metatranscriptomics and metabolomics, we found that the four species utilize different pollen-derived carbohydrate substrates indicating resource partitioning as the basis of coexistence. Our results show that despite longstanding host association, gut bacterial interactions can be recapitulated in vitro providing insights about bacterial coexistence when combined with in vivo experiments.",

    "abstract": "Brain function depends on segregation and integration of information processing in brain networks often separated by long-range anatomical connections. Neuronal oscillations orchestrate such distributed processing through transient amplitude and phase coupling, yet surprisingly little is known about local network properties facilitating these functional connections. Here, we test whether criticality--a dynamical state characterized by scale-free oscillations--optimizes the capacity of neuronal networks to couple through amplitude or phase, and transfer information. We coupled in silico networks with varying excitatory and inhibitory connectivity, and found that phase coupling emerges at criticality, and that amplitude coupling, as well as information transfer, are maximal when networks are critical. Importantly, regulating criticality through neuromodulation of synaptic strength showed that critical dynamics--as opposed to a static ratio of excitatory and inhibitory connections--optimize network coupling and information transfer. Our data support the idea that criticality is important for local and global information processing and may help explain why brain disorders characterized by local alterations in criticality also exhibit impaired long-range synchrony, even prior to degeneration of axonal connections.",

    "abstract": "FoF1-ATP synthases are ubiquitous membrane-bound, rotary motor enzymes that can catalyze ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. Their enzyme kinetics are controlled by internal subunit rotation, by substrate and product concentrations, by mechanical inhibitory mechanisms, but also by the electrochemical potential of protons across the membrane. Single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) has been used to detect subunit rotation within FoF1-ATP synthases embedded in freely diffusing liposomes. We now report that kinetic monitoring of functional rotation can be prolonged from milliseconds to seconds by utilizing an Anti-Brownian electrokinetic trap (ABEL trap). These extended observation times allowed us to observe fluctuating rates of functional rotation for individual FoF1-liposomes in solution. Broad distributions of ATP-dependent catalytic rates were revealed. The buildup of an electrochemical potential of protons was confirmed to limit the maximum rate of ATP hydrolysis. In the presence of ionophores or uncouplers, the fastest subunit rotation speeds measured in single reconstituted FoF1-ATP synthases were 180 full rounds per second. This was much faster than measured by biochemical ensemble averaging, but not as fast as the maximum rotational speed reported previously for isolated single F1 complexes uncoupled from the membrane-embedded Fo complex. Further application of ABEL trap measurements should help resolve the mechanistic causes of such fluctuating rates of subunit rotation.\n\nTOC GRAPHIC\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/436299v5_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bd800org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@228aeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bce39forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f01a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1.C_FLOATNO C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Top-down attention is a dynamic cognitive process that facilitates the detection of the task-relevant stimuli from our complex sensory environment. A neural mechanism capable of deployment under specific task-demand conditions would be crucial to efficiently control attentional processes and improve promote goal-directed attention performance during fluctuating attentional demand. Previous studies have shown that frontal top-down neurons projecting from the anterior cingulate area (ACA) to the visual cortex (VIS; ACAVIS) are required for visual attentional behavior during the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT) in mice. However, it is unknown whether the contribution of these projecting neurons is dependent on the extent of task demand. Here, we first examined how behavior outcomes depend on the number of locations for mice to pay attention and touch for successful performance, and found that the 2-choice serial reaction time task (2CSRTT) is less task demanding than the 5CSRTT. We then employed optogenetics to demonstrate that suppression ACAVIS projections immediately before stimulus presentation has no effect during the 2CSRTT in contrast to the impaired performance during the 5CSRTT. These results suggest that ACAVIS projections are necessary when task demand is high, but once a task demand is lowered, ACAVIS neuron activity becomes dispensable to adjust attentional performance. These findings support a model that the frontal-sensory ACAVIS projection regulates visual attention behavior during specific high task demand conditions, pointing to a flexible circuit-based mechanism for promoting attentional behavior.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of damaging missense variants is critically important for interpreting genome sequence. While many methods have been developed, their performance has been limited. Recent progress in machine learning and availability of large-scale population genomic sequencing data provide new opportunities to significantly improve computational predictions. Here we describe gMVP, a new method based on graph attention neural networks. Its main component is a graph with nodes capturing predictive features of amino acids and edges weighted by coevolution strength, which enables effective pooling of information from local protein context and functionally correlated distal positions. Evaluated by deep mutational scan data, gMVP outperforms published methods in identifying damaging variants in TP53, PTEN, BRCA1, and MSH2. Additionally, it achieves the best separation of de novo missense variants in neurodevelopmental disorder cases from the ones in controls. Finally, the model supports transfer learning to optimize gain- and loss-of-function predictions in sodium and calcium channels. In summary, we demonstrate that gMVP can improve interpretation of missense variants in clinical testing and genetic studies.",

    "abstract": "Previous psychological studies using questionnaires have consistently reported that athletes have superior motor imagery ability, both for sports-specific and sports non-specific movements. However, regarding motor imagery of sports non-specific movements, no physiological studies have demonstrated differences in neural activity between athletes and non-athletes. The purpose of the present study was to examine differences in bioelectric sensorimotor rhythms during kinesthetic motor imagery (KMI) of sports non-specific movements between gymnasts and non-gymnasts. We selected gymnasts as an example population because they are likely to have particularly superior motor imagery ability due to frequent usage of motor imagery including KMI as part of daily practice. Healthy young participants (16 gymnasts and 16 non-gymnasts) performed repeated motor execution and KMI of sports non-specific movements (wrist dorsiflexion and shoulder abduction of the dominant hand). Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. During motor execution and KMI, sensorimotor EEG power is known to decrease in the - (8-15 Hz) and {beta}-bands (16-35 Hz), referred to as event-related desynchronization (ERD). We calculated the maximal peak of ERD both in the - (ERDmax) and {beta}-bands ({beta}ERDmax) as a measure of changes in corticospinal excitability. ERDmax was significantly greater in gymnasts, who subjectively evaluated their KMI as being more vivid, for both KMI tasks. On the other hand, {beta}ERDmax was greater in gymnasts only for shoulder abduction KMI. These findings suggest gymnasts signature of flexibly modulating sensorimotor rhythm with no movements, which may be the basis of their superior ability of KMI for sports non-specific movements.\n\nNew & NoteworthyKinesthetic motor imagery of sports non-specific movements was compared between gymnasts and non-gymnasts (i.e., healthy controls) from both physiological and psychological approaches. The EEG sensorimotor rhythms during kinesthetic motor imagery were more desynchronized in gymnasts who subjectively imaged their own movements as being more vivid. The work reveals novel ability in gymnasts to flexibly control their sensorimotor rhythms with no actual movements, which would be the basis of their superior ability of motor imagery.",

    "abstract": "Single-Cell Analysis has revolutionised genomic science in recent years. However, due to cost and other practical considerations, single-cell analyses are impossible for studies based on medium or large patient cohorts. For example, a single-cell analysis usually costs thousands of euros for one tissue sample from one volunteer, meaning that typical studies using single-cell analyses are based on very few individuals. While single-cell genomic data can be used to examine the phenotype of individual cells, cell-type deconvolution methods are required to track the quantities of these cells in bulk-tissue genomic data. Hormone receptor negative breast cancers are highly aggressive, and are thought to originate from a subtype of epithelial cells called the luminal progenitor. In this paper, we show how to quantify the number of luminal progenitor cells as well as other epithelial subtypes in breast tissue samples using DNA and RNA based measurements. We find elevated levels of cells which resemble these hormone receptor negative luminal progenitor cells in breast tumour biopsies of hormone receptor negative cancers, as well as in healthy breast tissue samples from BRCA1 (FANCS) mutation carriers. We also find that breast tumours from carriers of heterozygous mutations in non-BRCA Fanconi Anaemia pathway genes are much more likely to be hormone receptor negative. These findings have implications for understanding hormone receptor negative breast cancers, and for breast cancer screening in carriers of heterozygous mutations of Fanconi Anaemia pathway genes.",

Through the use of activity tracking and procedural connectivity (dynamical regeneration of synapses), both computational and memory complexities of this algorithm are proved to be theoretically linear with the number of neurons. These results are experimentally validated by sequential simulations of millions of neurons and billions of synapses running in few minutes using a single thread of an equivalent desktop computer.",

    "abstract": "Microbes can form complex communities that perform critical functions in maintaining the integrity of their environment or their hosts well-being. Rationally managing these microbial communities requires improving our ability to predict how different species assemblages affect the final species composition of the community. However, making such a prediction remains challenging because of our limited knowledge of the diverse physical, biochemical, and ecological processes governing microbial dynamics. To overcome this challenge, here we present a deep learning framework that automatically learns the map between species assemblages and community compositions from training data only, without knowledge of any of the above processes. First, we systematically validate our framework using synthetic data generated by classical population dynamics models. Then, we apply it to experimental data of both in vitro and in vivo communities, including ocean and soil microbial communities, Drosophila melanogaster gut microbiota, and human gut and oral microbiota. In particular, we show how our framework learns to perform accurate out-of-sample predictions of complex community compositions from a small number of training samples. Our results demonstrate how deep learning can enable us to understand better and potentially manage complex microbial communities.",

Unlike other image correlation techniques, we demonstrated that our method could be applied irrespective of a non-uniformly distributed, immobile blinking fluorophore population. This allows us to measure blinking and transport dynamics in complex cell morphologies, a benefit for a range of super-resolution fluorescence imaging approaches that rely on probe emission blinking. Furthermore, we showed that our technique could be applied without directly accounting for photobleaching. We successfully employed our technique on several simulations with realistic EMCCD noise and photobleaching models, as well as on Dronpa-C12 labeled beta-actin in living NIH/3T3 and HeLa cells. We found that the diffusion coefficients measured using our method were consistent with previous literature values. We further found that photoblinking rates measured in the live HeLa cells varied as expected with changing excitation power.",

    "abstract": "Geneflow across populations is a critical determinant of population genetic structure, divergence and local adaptation. While evolutionary theory typically envisions geneflow as a continuous connection among populations, many processes make it fluctuating and intermittent. We analyze a mainland-island model in which migration occurs as recurrent \"pulses\". We derive mathematical predictions regarding how the level of migration pulsedness affects the effective migration rate, for neutral and selected mainland alleles. We find that migration pulsedness can either decrease or increase geneflow, depending on the selection regime. Migration increases gene-flow for sufficiently (counter)selected alleles (s < s1), but reduces it otherwise. We provide a mathematical approximation of the threshold selection s1, which is verified in stochastic simulations. Migration pulsedness thus affects the fixation rate at different loci in opposite ways, in a way that cannot be described as a change in effective population size. We show that migration pulsedness would generally reduce the level of local adaptation, and introduce an additional genetic load: the \"pulsedness load\". Our results indicate that migration pulsedness can be detrimental to the adaptation and persistence of small peripheral populations, with implications in management and conservation. Our results highlight temporally variable migration as an important process for evolutionary and population genetics.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid incompatibilities occur when interactions between opposite-ancestry alleles at different loci reduce the fitness of hybrids. Most work on incompatibilities has focused on those that are  intrinsic, meaning they affect viability and sterility in the laboratory. Theory predicts that ecological selection can also underlie hybrid incompatibilities, but tests of this hypothesis are scarce. In this article, we compiled genetic data for F2 hybrid crosses between divergent populations of threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) that were born and raised in either the field (semi-natural experimental ponds) or the laboratory (aquaria). We tested for differences in excess heterozygosity between these two environments at ancestry informative loci--a genetic signature of selection against incompatibilities. We found that excess ancestry heterozygosity was elevated by approximately 3% in crosses raised in ponds compared to those raised in aquaria. Previous results from F1 hybrids in the field suggest that pond-specific (single-locus) heterosis is unlikely to explain this finding. Our study suggests that, in stickleback, a coarse signal of environment-dependent hybrid incompatibilities is reliably detectable and that extrinsic incompatibilities have evolved before intrinsic incompatibilities.",

    "abstract": "The genomic miscellany of malaria parasites can inform the intensity of transmission and identify potential deficiencies in malaria control programs. The aim of this study was to investigate the genomic miscellany, allele frequencies and multiplicity of infection (MOI) of P. falciparum.\n\nMethodsA total of 85 isolates from patients presenting to the local health centers with P. falciparum species were collected from 2017 to 2019. Parasite DNA was extracted from a total of 200 {micro}l whole blood per patient using the Qiagen DNA extraction kit according to manufactures instructions. The polymorphic region of msp-1, msp-2 and glurp loci were genotyped by using nested polymerase chain reactions followed by gel electrophoresis for fragment analysis.\n\nResultsGenetic diversity and allelic frequencies of msp-1, msp-2 and glurp were identified in 85 blood samples. A total of 62 msp alleles were detected in which 30 for msp-1 and 32 for msp-2. For msp-1 the successful amplification occurred in (75/85) 88.23% isolates for msp-1, 78.9% (67/85) for msp-2 and 70% (60/85) for glurp. For msp-1, the K1 allelic family was predominant at 66.66% (50/75), followed by RO33 and MAD20. The frequency of samples having only K1, MAD20 and RO33 were 21.34% (16/75), 8% (6/75) and 10.67% (8/75) respectively. In msp-2, the FC27 allelic family was the most abundant with 70.14% (47/67) compared to 3D7 with 67.16% (45/67). Nine glurp RII region genotypes were identified. The overall mean multiplicity of infection was 2.6 with1.8 and 1.4 for msp-1 and msp-2 respectively while for glurp RII genes (MOI=1.03). There was no significant association between multiplicity of infection and age group (Spearmans rank coefficient = 0.050; P = 0.6). There was significant correlation between MOI and parasite density for msp-2 allelic family.\n\nConclusionOur study showed high genetic diversity and allelic frequency with multiple clones of msp-1, msp-2 and glurp in P. falciparum isolates from malaria patients in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pakistan. In the present study the genotype data provided the valuable information which is essential for monitoring the impact of malaria eradication efforts in this region.",

By tracking fluorescently labeled lambda phages that do not infect Capnocytophaga gingivalis, a bacterium abundant in the human oral microbiota, we demonstrate active phage transportation by a C. gingivalis swarm. As a result, the rate of disruption of the prey of lambda phage i.e., an Escherichia coli colony, increases 10 times. C. gingivalis drills tunnels within a curli fiber containing E. coli biofilm and increase the efficiency of phage penetration.

The activation of the underlying defence responses can depend on variation in perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns or elicitors. To dissect such variation, we evaluated the responses induced by laminarin, (a glucan, representing an elicitor from oomycetes) in the wild tomato species Solanum chilense and correlated this to observed infection frequencies of Phytophthora infestans.\n\nWe measured reactive oxygen species burst and levels of diverse phytohormones upon elicitation in 83 plants originating from nine populations. We found high diversity in basal and elicitor-induced levels of each component. Further we generated linear models to explain the observed infection frequency of P. infestans. The effect of individual components differed dependent on the geographical origin of the plants. We found that the resistance in the southern coastal region, but not in the other regions is directly correlated to ethylene responses and confirmed this positive correlation using ethylene inhibition assays.\n\nOur findings reveal high diversity in the strength of defence responses within a species and the involvement of different components with a quantitatively different contribution of individual components to resistance in geographically separated populations of a wild plant species.\n\nHighlightLarge-scale screenings reveal geographically distinct intraspecific differences in the dominant physiological pathogen defence responses upon glucan elicitor treatment in a wild tomato species.",

Partitioning between these pathways has been suggested to be controlled by temperature and stimulus paradigm. We report on the comprehensive survey of six major SV proteins to show that SV endocytosis in hippocampal neurons at physiological temperature occurs independent of clathrin while the endocytic retrieval of a subset of SV proteins including the vesicular transporters for glutamate and GABA depend on sorting by the clathrin adaptor AP-2. Our findings highlight a clathrin-independent role of the clathrin adaptor AP-2 in the endocytic retrieval of select SV cargos from the presynaptic cell surface and suggest a unified model for the endocytosis of SV membranes at mammalian central synapses.",

We demonstrated that heterozygous/homozygous disruption of PIKfyve kinase domain, instead of overexpression of PIKFYVEG1943E in zebrafish mimicked the cataract defect in human patients, suggesting that haploinsufficiency, rather than dominant-negative inhibition of PIKfyve activity caused the disease. Phenotypical analysis of pikfyve zebrafish mutants revealed that loss of Pikfyve caused aberrant vacuolation (accumulation of Rab7+Lc3+ amphisomes) in lens cells, which was significantly alleviated by treatment with the V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1). Collectively, we identified PIKFYVE as a novel causative gene for congenital cataract and demonstrated the potential application of Baf-A1 in treatment of congenital cataract.",

It is typically propagated by stem cuttings and any genetic variation between haplotypes, including large structural variations, is preserved by such clonal propagation. Traditional genome assembly approaches generate a collapsed haplotype representation of the genome. In highly heterozygous plants, this results in artifacts and an oversimplification of heterozygous regions. We used a combination of Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), Illumina, and Hi-C to resolve each haplotype of the genome of a farmer-preferred cassava line, TME7 (Oko-iyawo). PacBio reads were assembled using the FALCON suite. Phase switch errors were corrected using FALCON-Phase and Hi-C read data. The ultra-long-range information from Hi-C sequencing was also used for scaffolding. Comparison of the two phases revealed more than 5,000 large haplotype-specific structural variants affecting over 8 Mb, including insertions and deletions spanning thousands of base pairs. The potential of these variants to affect allele specific expression was further explored. RNA-seq data from 11 different tissue types were mapped against the scaffolded haploid assembly and gene expression data are incorporated into our existing easy-to-use web-based interface to facilitate use by the broader plant science community. These two assemblies provide an excellent means to study the effects of heterozygosity, haplotype-specific structural variation, gene hemizygosity, and allele specific gene expression contributing to important agricultural traits and further our understanding of the genetics and domestication of cassava.\n\nSignificance statementThe cassava varieties grown by subsistence farmers in Africa largely differ from the inbred reference genome due to their highly heterozygous nature. We used multiple sequencing technologies to assemble and resolve both haplotypes in TME7, a farmer-preferred cassava line, enabling us to study the considerable haplotypic structural variation in this line.",

    "abstract": "HAT1 is a central regulator of chromatin synthesis that acetylates nascent histone H3:H4 tetramers in the cytoplasm. It may have a role in cancer metabolism by linking cytoplasmic production of acetyl-CoA to nuclear acetyl flux. This is because the HAT1 di-acetylation mark is not propagated in chromatin and instead is de-acetylated after nascent histone insertion into chromatin. Thus, HAT1 likely provides a nuclear source of free acetate that may be recycled to acetyl-CoA for nuclear acetylation reactions. Correspondingly, suppression of HAT1 protein expression impairs tumor growth. To ascertain whether targeting HAT1 is a viable anti-cancer treatment strategy we sought to identify small molecule inhibitors of HAT1. We developed a high-throughput HAT1 acetyl-click assay to facilitate drug discovery and enzymology. Screening of small molecules computationally predicted to bind the active site led to the discovery of multiple riboflavin analogs that inhibited HAT1 enzymatic activity by competing with acetyl-CoA binding. These hits were refined by synthesis and testing over 70 analogs, which yielded structure-activity relationships. The isoalloxazine core was required for enzymatic inhibition, whereas modifications of the ribityl sidechain improved enzymatic potency and cellular growth suppression. These efforts resulted in a lead compound (JG-2016) that suppressed growth of human cancer cells lines in vitro and impaired tumor growth in vivo. This is the first report of a small molecule inhibitor of the HAT1 enzyme complex and represents a step towards targeting this pathway for cancer therapy.",

However, the performance characteristics of these approaches have not been systematically characterized. We compared assembly- and read-based approaches to determine sensitivity, positive predictive value, and sequencing limits of detection required for AMR gene detection in an Escherichia coli ST38 isolate spiked into a synthetic microbial community at varying abundances. Using an assembly-based method the limit of detection was 15X genome coverage. We are confident in AMR gene detection at target relative abundances of 100% to 1%, where a target abundance of 1% would require assembly of approximately 30 million reads to achieve 15X target coverage.

    "abstract": "In mammals, insulin is involved in controlling blood glucose levels and its role in modulating immunity is being more and more documented. This hormone promotes the release of inositolphosphate glycans (IPG) which act as mediators. In plants, one IG has already been identified in plant culture cells (Smith and Fry, 1999; Smith et al., 1999) but, to our knowledge, no IPG have been yet identified. Here, we discovered 7 IPG that are accumulated upon Arabidopsis thaliana-Botrytis cinerea interaction, concomitantly with oligogalacturonides and a fucosylated xyloglucan oligosaccharide. Further structural characterization showed that they come from the hydrolysis of polar heads of Serie A to H glycosylinositol phosphorylceramides presumably via a phospholipase C activity. Taken together with the emerging role of insulin as immune regulator, these results question the role of IPG as damage associated molecular pattern both in animal and plant kingdoms.",

    "abstract": "Callose deposition around sieve pores, under control of callose synthase 7 (AtCALS7), has been interpreted as a mechanical response to limit pathogen spread in phytoplasma-infected plants. Wild-type and Atcals7ko mutants were therefore employed to unveil the mode of involvement of CALS7 in the plants response to phytoplasma infection. The fresh weights of healthy and CY-(Chrysanthemum Yellows) phytoplasma-infected Arabidopsis wild-type and mutant plants indicated two superimposed effects of the absence of CALS7: a partial impairment of photo-assimilate transport and a stimulated phytoplasma proliferation as illustrated by a significantly increased phytoplasma titre in Atcal7ko mutants. Further studies solely dealt with the effects of CALS7 absence on phytoplasma growth. Phytoplasma infection affected sieve-element substructure to a larger extent in mutants than in wild-type plants, which was also true for the levels of some free carbohydrates. Moreover, infection induced a similar upregulation of gene expression of enzymes involved in sucrose cleavage (AtSUS5, AtSUS6) and transmembrane transport (AtSWEET11) in mutants and wild-type plants, but an increased gene expression of carbohydrate transmembrane transporters (AtSWEET12, AtSTP13, AtSUC3) in infected mutants only. It remains still unclear how the absence of AtCALS7 leads to gene upregulation and how an increased intercellular mobility of carbohydrates and possibly effectors contributes to a higher susceptibility. It is also unclear if modified sieve-pore structures in mutants allow a better spread of phytoplasmas giving rise to higher titre.\n\nAuthor SummaryPhytoplasma infections are one of the most limiting factors for production of important crops all over the world. Phytoplasma disease epidemics can be handled mainly by insect-vector control using insecticides. Basic information about plant-phytoplasma interactions are still limited, nevertheless it is necessary to design new management and breeding strategies aimed to obtain more tolerant or resistant cultivars. Phytoplasmas are obligate intracellular parasites restricted to the phloem sieve tubes. Callose deposition at the sieve plates has been described since the  70s as a mechanical defence process to limit pathogen spread by occluding sieve pores. Studies reported 40 years later demonstrated that callose at the sieve pores is also involved in sieve-pore development and function and, hence, in mass-flow regulation, carbohydrate metabolism and distribution, and plant growth. Here, we reported on the role(s) of sieve-element callose in phytoplasma-infected Arabidopsis, using a mutant lacking AtCALS7, the enzyme responsible for callose synthesis in the sieve elements. The results indicate that loss of AtCAL7 appears to confer increased susceptibility to phytoplasma infection, due to alterations in expression of genes involved in sugar metabolism and membrane transport. In the long run, the identification of plant resistance or susceptibility traits against phytoplasmas will allow a complete re-organization of chemical control strategies, with obvious opportunities of reducing insecticide burden.",

    "abstract": "Drought and leaf blight caused by the fungus Ascochyta rabiei often co-occur in chickpea (Cicer arietinum)-producing areas. While the responses of chickpea to either drought or A. rabiei infection have been extensively studied, their combined effect on plant defense mechanisms is unknown. Fine modulation of stress-induced signaling pathways under combined stress is an important stress adaptation mechanism that warrants a better understanding. Here we show that drought facilitates resistance against A. rabiei infection in chickpea. The analysis of proline levels and gene expression profiling of its biosynthetic pathway under combined drought and A. rabiei infection revealed the gene encoding proline dehydrogenase (CaProDH2) as a strong candidate conferring resistance to A. rabiei infection. Transcript levels of CaProDH2, pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) quantification, and measurement of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production showed that fine modulation of the proline-P5C cycle determines the observed resistance. In addition, CaProDH2-silenced plants lost basal resistance to A. rabiei infection induced by drought, while overexpression of the gene conferred higher resistance to the fungus. We suggest that the drought-induced accumulation of proline in the cytosol helps maintain cell turgor and raises mitochondrial P5C contents by a CaProDH2-mediated step, which results in ROS production that boosts plant defense responses and confers resistance to A. rabiei infection. Our findings indicate that manipulating the proline-P5C pathway may be a possible strategy for improving stress tolerance in plants suffering from combined drought and A. rabiei infection.",

Although early life factors have been shown to affect the infant gut microbiota development, our current understanding of the human gut colonization in early life remains limited.\n\nTo gain more insights in the unique dynamics of this rapidly evolving ecosystem, we investigated the microbiota over the first year of life in eight densely sampled infants (total number of samples, n=303). To evaluate gut microbiota maturation transition towards an adult configuration, we compared the microbiome composition of the infants to the Flemish Gut Flora Project population (n=1,106).\n\nResultsWe observed the infant gut microbiota to mature through three distinct, conserved stages of ecosystem development. Across these successional gut microbiota maturation stages, genus predominance was observed to shift from Escherichia over Bifidobacterium to Bacteroides. Both disease and antibiotic treatment were observed to be associated occasionally with gut microbiota maturation stage regression, a transient setback in microbiota maturation dynamics. Although the studied microbiota trajectories evolved to more adult-like constellations, microbiome community typing against the background of the Flemish Gut Flora Project (FGFP) cohort clustered all infant samples within the (in adults) potentially dysbiotic Bact2 enterotype.\n\nConclusionWe confirmed similarities between infant gut microbial colonization and adult dysbiosis. A profound knowledge about the primary gut colonization process in infants might provide crucial insights into how the secondary colonization of a dysbiotic adult gut can be redirected.",

    "abstract": "The predatory mite Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) (Mesostigmata: Phytoseiidae) has been commercialized by manufacturers in the pest control industry and is used worldwide as a natural enemy of spider mites. However, because its genome has not been sequenced, reverse genetics techniques that could be used to analyze gene function have not been established. Here we partially sequenced the gene that encodes the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), an ATP-dependent proton pump, in N. californicus (NcVATPase) and then conducted a functional analysis using environmental RNA interference (eRNAi) by orally administering sequence-specific exogenous dsRNA (dsRNA-NcVATPase) to larvae and adult females. The larvae treated with dsRNA-NcVATPase took longer to develop and had lower survivorship, fecundity, and offspring viability at the adult stage than those treated with a control dsRNA. Adult females treated with dsRNA-NcVATPase showed significant reductions in survival, fecundity, and prey consumption, and their endogenous gene expression level of NcVATPase was reduced by approximately 65% compared with the control. Our findings suggest that the NcVATPase gene, silencing of which inhibits feeding and reproduction, is an excellent biomarker for investigating the eRNAi mechanism in N. californicus. The highly efficient experimental system of eRNAi established in this study paves the way for applied research using eRNAi to enhance the predatory ability of N. californicus.\n\nKey messageO_LIEnvironmental RNAi-inducing double-stranded RNAs have the potential to improve biological control as well as biopesticide applications.\nC_LIO_LIWe investigated the efficacy of eRNAi against the predatory mite Neoseiulus californicus, a major natural enemy of spider mites.\nC_LIO_LIOral administration of dsRNA targeting NcVATPase decreased the gene expression level, developmental time, survival, fecundity, and prey consumption.\nC_LIO_LINeoseiulus californicus, which was found to have the high eRNAi effects, can be used as a model for the study on eRNAi-mediated improvement of biological control.\nC_LI",

We analyze simulations modelling local adaptation to heterogeneous environments either using a GEA method that controls for population structure or an uncorrected approach. In the majority of cases we tested, the WZA either outperformed single-SNP based approaches or performed similarly.

Whole Wolbachia genome sequencing shows that the wAlbBQ transinfection is near-identical to the reference wAlbB genome, suggesting few changes since the infection was first introduced to Ae. aegypti over 15 years ago. However, these sequences were distinct from other available wAlbB genome sequences, highlighting the potential diversity of wAlbB in natural Ae. albopictus populations. Phenotypic comparisons demonstrate effects of wAlbB infection on egg hatch and nuclear background on fecundity and body size, but no interactions between wAlbB infection and nuclear background for any trait.

Hence, the present data on embryonic metaboloepigenetic will contribute to understanding how the in vitro manipulation affects the metaboloepigenetic status of early embryos, which can be used to establish culture strategies aimed at improving the in vitro environment and, consequently, pregnancy rates and offspring health.",

    "abstract": "The  inverse problem of mass spectrometric molecular identification ( given a mass spectrum, calculate the molecule whence it came) is largely unsolved, and is especially acute in metabolomics where many small molecules remain unidentified. This is largely because the number of experimentally available electrospray mass spectra of small molecules is quite limited. However, the forward problem ( calculate a small molecules likely fragmentation and hence at least some of its mass spectrum from its structure alone) is much more tractable, because the strengths of different chemical bonds are roughly known. This kind of molecular identification problem may be cast as a language translation problem in which the source language is a list of high-resolution mass spectral peaks and the  translation a representation (for instance in SMILES) of the molecule. It is thus suitable for attack using the deep neural networks known as transformers. We here present MassGenie, a method that uses a transformer-based deep neural network, trained on ~6 million chemical structures with augmented SMILES encoding and their paired molecular fragments as generated in silico, explicitly including the protonated molecular ion. This architecture (containing some 400 million elements) is used to predict the structure of a molecule from the various fragments that may be expected to be observed when some of its bonds are broken. Despite being given essentially no detailed nor explicit rules about molecular fragmentation methods, isotope patterns, rearrangements, neutral losses, and the like, MassGenie learns the effective properties of the mass spectral fragment and valency space, and can generate candidate molecular structures that are very close or identical to those of the  true molecules. We also use VAE-Sim, a previously published variational autoencoder, to generate candidate molecules that are  similar to the top hit. In addition to using the  top hits directly, we can produce a rank order of these by  round-tripping candidate molecules and comparing them with the true molecules, where known. As a proof of principle, we confine ourselves to positive electrospray mass spectra from molecules with a molecular mass of 500Da or lower. The transformer method, applied here for the first time to mass spectral interpretation, works extremely effectively both for mass spectra generated in silico and on experimentally obtained mass spectra from pure compounds. The ability to create and to  learn millions of fragmentation patterns in silico, and therefrom generate candidate structures (that do not have to be in existing libraries) directly, thus opens up entirely the field of de novo small molecule structure prediction from experimental mass spectra.",

    "abstract": "Rac1 is a key regulator of several cell signaling pathways and dysregulated Rac1 activation has been implicated in cancer. Genetically encoded Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors with enhanced dynamic range enabled live cell fluorescence imaging of Rac1 activity and a cell lysate-based assay of Rac1 inhibition in 96-well plates. We prepared HEK293 cell lines that stably expressed polypeptides with a general domain sequence (N- to C-terminus) of 1) FRET acceptor; 2) Rac/Cdc42 binding domain of human p21 protein kinase A (residues 68-150); 3) a linker domain; 4) FRET donor; and 5) full-length Rac1. Activated Rac1 binds to the protein kinase A domain, bringing donors and acceptors close together to increase FRET. We evaluated the effects on FRET signal dynamic range of alpha helical linkers comprised of alternating repeats of roughly four glutamate and four arginine or lysine residues. So-called ER/K linkers had limited effects on conventional FRET biosensors that incorporated the fluorescent protein (FP) pairs mCerulean/YPet, or mTFP1(cp227)/mVenus(cp229). Fluorometric measurements of cells that co-expresssed biosensors with positive (TIAM1) or negative (RhoGDI) Rac1 regulators revealed significant dynamic range enhancement in only one FP construct (mCerulean/YPet with 20 nm ER/K linker) relative to an analogous structure that incorporated an unstructured linker. We transfected this construct into a cell line that stably expressed a rapamycin-inducible c-Src analog (RapR-Src) and observed activation of Rac1 at protruding edges following rapamycin stimulation. In cells that expressed lanthanide-based FRET (LRET biosensors) that incorporated a luminescent terbium complex donor and GFP fluorescent acceptor, time-gated luminescence (TGL) measurements showed substantial gains in dynamic range that increased with linker length (up to 1200%). We robustly detected small molecule Rac1 inhibition following lysis of LRET biosensor-expressing cells grown directly in 96-well plates. The results herein highlight the potential of FRET and LRET biosensors with ER/K linkers for cell-based imaging and screening of protein activities.",

Morphological and molecular characters confirmed the species identification. Quick surveys around the island of Sao Miguel showed that it has successfully colonized the island and is quickly expanding. In some locations, R. okamurae is currently the dominant organism smothering all other benthic biota and posing a serious threat to the benthic ecosystems across the region. The species first record dates from 2019 near the main harbour of the island, suggesting that its introduction was driven by human-assisted transport, via boat ballast waters or adhered to ship hulls and likely originating from the Mediterranean populations that have been proliferating in recent years across the Strait of Gibraltar.",

At the single cell level, shape changes steered by actomyosin contractile forces include mitotic rounding and cytokinetic furrow ingression. In some cases, more complex shape transitions associated with spatial patterning of the cortex were observed. The actomyosin cortex was widely studied using active gel frameworks, and stabilized contractile instabilities were shown to generate patterns, but whether complex shapes can emerge from these cortical patterns is not established. Here we show that complex morphogenetic changes at the single cell level can accompany cortical patterns, using a minimal active gel model. For sufficiently low membranecortex drag, an initially homogeneous cortex spontaneously develops stripes associated with stable furrows, similar to furrowing observed in cells. Our work suggests that controlled cortical instability can trigger morphogenesis at the cellular level.",

    "abstract": "Proper ionic concentrations are required for the functional dynamics of RNA and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assemblies. While experimental and computational techniques have provided many insights into the properties of chelated ions, less is known about the energetic contributions of diffuse ions to large-scale conformational rearrangements. To address this, we present a model that is designed to quantify the influence of diffuse monovalent and divalent ions on the dynamics of biomolecular assemblies. This model employs all-atom (non-H) resolution and explicit ions, where effective potentials account for hydration effects. We first show that the model accurately predicts the number of excess Mg2+ ions for prototypical RNA systems, at a level comparable to modern coarse-grained models. We then apply the model to a complete ribosome and show how the balance between diffuse Mg2+ and K+ ions can control the dynamics of tRNA molecules during translation. The model predicts differential effects of diffuse ions on the free-energy barrier associated with tRNA entry and the energy of tRNA binding to the ribosome. Together, this analysis reveals the direct impact of diffuse ions on the dynamics of an RNP assembly.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/448160v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14f36caorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1963073org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@146fbf8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14860ab_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In this model, male and female golden Syrian hamsters were inoculated intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020. Groups of inoculated and mock-inoculated uninfected control animals were euthanized at day 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28 days post-inoculation to track multiple clinical, pathology, virology, and immunology outcomes. SARS-CoV-2-inoculated animals consistently lost body weight during the first week of infection, had higher lung weights at terminal timepoints, and developed lung consolidation per histopathology and quantitative image analysis measurements. High levels of infectious virus and viral RNA were reliably present in the respiratory tract at days 2 and 4 post-inoculation, corresponding with widespread necrosis and inflammation. At day 7, when infectious virus was rare, interstitial and alveolar macrophage infiltrates and marked reparative epithelial responses (type II hyperplasia) dominated in the lung. These lesions resolved over time, with only residual epithelial repair evident by day 28 post-inoculation. The use of quantitative approaches to measure cellular and morphologic alterations in the lung provides valuable outcome measures for developing therapeutic and preventive interventions for COVID-19 using the hamster COVID-19 model.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesWomen in oral health science face similar societal issues and challenges as those in other STEMM careers, and gender disparities continue to exist as evidenced by fewer women represented as first and last authors in scientific publications. Pre-prints may serve as a conduit to immediately disseminating ones work, bypassing the arduous peer review process and its associated inherent biases. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to 1] compare the gender of first and last authors in pre-print versus peer reviewed publications, 2] examine the composition of first and last author pairs as stratified by publication type, and 3] examine the correlation between woman authorship and institutional geographic location and publication metrics stratified by publication type.\n\nMethodsThe keyword \"oral health\" was used to search for publications in BioRxiv and Pubmed in the years 2018 and 2019. Gender of first and last authors were determined, and its frequency was considered as the primary outcome. Additionally, the geographic location of the authors associated institution and publication metrics measured by Altmetrics score were extracted. Data was descriptively summarized by frequencies and percentages. Chi-square analysis was conducted for categorical variables which included the relationship between gender and publication type as well as gender and region of authors associated institution. Binomial regression analysis was conducted to analyze the relationship between gender and Altmetrics.\n\nResultsWoman first authors comprised 40.3% of pre-prints and 64.5% of peer reviewed publications [p<0.05]. Woman last authors comprised 31.3% of pre-prints and 61.5% of peer reviewed publications [p<0.05]. When analyzing the relationships between first and last author, the Man-Man pairing represented 47.7% of the pre-print publications and the Woman-Woman pairing comprised a majority of the of the peer review publications at 47.5%. All results were statistically significant with a p-value <0.05. No significant correlation was found between region of institution or Altmetrics and gender of first or last authors [p>0.05].\n\nConclusionFor the first time in oral health science, it was found that women show higher representation as first and last author positions in peer reviewed publications versus pre-prints.",

Here we decipher dynamic functional interactions by identifying significant cellular contexts, primarily by oncogenic mutation, lineage, and tumor type, and discovering coessentiality relationships that depend on these contexts. We recapitulate well-known gene-context interactions such as oncogene-mutation, paralog buffering, and tissue-specific essential genes, show how mutation rewires known signal transduction pathways, including RAS/RAF and IGF1R-PIK3CA, and illustrate the implications for drug targeting. We further demonstrate how context-dependent functional interactions can elucidate lineage-specific gene function, as illustrated by the maturation of proreceptors IGF1R and MET by proteases FURIN and CPD. This approach advances our understanding of context-dependent interactions and how they can be gleaned from these data.

    "abstract": "Linear motifs have an integral role in dynamic cell functions including cell signalling, the cell cycle and others. However, due to their small size, low complexity, degenerate nature, and frequent mutations, identifying novel functional motifs is a challenging task. Viral proteins rely extensively on the molecular mimicry of cellular linear motifs for modifying cell signalling and other processes in ways that favour viral infection. This study aims to discover human linear motifs convergently evolved also in disordered regions of viral proteins, under the hypothesis that these will result in enrichment in functional motif instances. We systematically apply computational motif prediction, combined with implementation of several functional and structural filters to the most recent publicly available human-viral and human-human protein interaction network. By limiting the search space to the sequences of viral proteins, we observed an increase in the sensitivity of motif prediction, as well as improved enrichment in known instances compared to the same analysis using only human protein interactions. We identified > 8,400 motif instances at various confidence levels, 105 of which were supported by all functional and structural filters applied. Overall, we provide a pipeline to improve the identification of functional linear motifs from interactomics datasets and a comprehensive catalogue of putative human motifs that can contribute to our understanding of the human domain-linear motif code and the mechanisms of viral interference with this.",

    "abstract": "Preterm infants often show pathologies of the cerebellum, which are associated with impaired motor performance, lower IQ and poor language skills at school ages. Because 1 in 10 babies is born preterm cerebellar injury is a significant clinical problem. The causes of cerebellar damage are yet to be fully explained. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that perinatal inflammatory stimuli may play a key role in cerebellar injury of preterm infants. We undertook our studies in an established mouse model of inflammation-induced encephalopathy of prematurity driven by systemic administration of the prototypic pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}). Inflammation is induced between postnatal day (P) 1 to day 5, timing equivalent to the last trimester for brain development in humans the period of vulnerability to preterm birth related brain injury. We investigated acute and long-term consequences for the cerebellum on brain volume expansion, oligodendroglial maturation, myelin levels and the microglial transcriptome. Perinatal inflammation induced global mouse brain volume reductions, including specific grey and white matter volume reductions in cerebellar lobules I and II (5% FDR) in IL-1{beta} versus control treated mice from P15 onwards. Oligodendroglia damage preceded the MRI-detectable volume changes, as evidenced by a reduced proliferation of OLIG2+ cells at P10 and reduced levels of the myelin proteins MOG, MBP and MAG at P10 and P15. Increased density of Iba1+ cerebellar microglia was observed at P5 and P45, with evidence for increased microglial proliferation at P5 and P10. Comparison of the transcriptome of microglia isolated from P5 cerebelli and cerebrum revealed significant enrichment of pro-inflammatory markers in microglia from both regions, but in the cerebellum microglia displayed a unique type I interferon signalling dysregulation. Collectively, these data suggest that in our model that systemic inflammation causes chronic activation of microglia and maldevelopment of cerebellum that includes myelin deficits which is driven in the cerebellum by type I interferon signalling. Future protective strategies for preterm infants should consider sustained type I interferon signalling driven cerebellar inflammation as an important target.",

Our data reveal distinct immune profiles across the endovascular and tissue compartments with tractable dynamics throughout gestation that respond to a systemic immune challenge in a gestationally-dependent manner. We uncover that mononuclear phagocytes and neutrophils drive the temporal immune composition of the placenta with remarkably diverse populations, including PD-L1-expressing subsets having compartmental and early gestational bias.

We found that the mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) carrying exogenous TERT or FST (MCMVTERT or MCMVFST) extended median lifespan by 41.4% and 32.5%, respectively. This is the first report of CMV being used successfully as both an intranasal and injectable gene therapy system to extend longevity. Treatment significantly improved glucose tolerance, physical performance, and prevented loss of body mass and alopecia. Telomere shortening seen with aging was ameliorated by TERT, and mitochondrial structure deterioration was halted in both treatments. Intranasal and injectable preparations performed equally well in safely and efficiently delivering gene therapy to multiple organs, with long-lasting benefits and without carcinogenicity or unwanted side effects. Translating this research to humans could have significant benefits associated with increased health span.",

    "abstract": "Microbiome studies across taxa have established the influence of host genotype on microbial recruitment and maintenance. However, research exploring host-specific epibionts in scleractinian corals is scant and the influence of intraspecific differences across environments remains unclear. Here, we studied the epibiome of ten Acropora cervicornis genotypes to investigate the relative roles of host genotype and environment in structuring the epibiome. Coral mucus was sampled in a common garden nursery from replicate ramets of distinct genotypes (T0). Coral fragment replicates (n=3) of each genotype were then transplanted to nine different field sites in the Lower Florida Keys and mucus was again sampled one year later from surviving ramets (T12). 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to assess microbial composition, richness, and beta-diversity. The most abundant and consistent amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) in all samples belonged to Fokiniaceae (MD3-55 genus) and Cyanobacteria (Synechococccus). The abundances of these bacterial taxa varied consistently between genotypes whereas neither the composition nor taxonomic abundance were significantly different among field sites. Interestingly, several high MD3-55 hosting genotypes showed rapid diversification and an increase in MD3-55 following transplantation. Overall, our results indicate healthy A. cervicornis genotypes retain distinct epibiome signatures through time, suggesting a strong host component. Lastly, our results show that differences in MD3-55 abundances can be consistently detected in the epibiome of distinct host-genotypes of A. cervicornis. As this organism (sensu Aquarickettsia rohweri) has been implicated as a marker of disease resistance, this finding reinforces the potential use of microbial indicators in reef restoration efforts via non-invasive surface/mucus sampling.",

    "abstract": "A common way for bacteria to cooperate is via the secretion of beneficial public goods (proteases, siderophores, biosurfactants) that can be shared among individuals in a group. Bacteria often simultaneously deploy multiple public goods with complementary functions. This raises the question whether natural selection could favour division of labour where subpopulations or species specialise in the production of a single public good, whilst sharing the complementary goods at the group level. Here we use an experimental system, where we genetically enforce specialization in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa with regard to the production of its two siderophores, pyochelin and pyoverdine, and explore the conditions under which specialization can lead to division of labour. When growing pyochelin and pyoverdine specialists at different mixing ratios in various iron limited environments, we found that specialists could only successfully complement each other in environments with moderate iron limitation and grow as good as the generalist wildtype but not better. Under more stringent iron limitation, the dynamics in specialist communities was characterized by mutual cheating and with higher proportions of pyochelin producers greatly compromising group productivity. Nonetheless, specialist communities remained stable through negative frequency-dependent selection. Our work shows that specialization in a bacterial community can be spurred by mutual cheating and does not necessarily result in beneficial division of labour. We propose that natural selection might favour fine-tuned regulatory mechanisms in generalists over division of labour because the former enables generalists to remain flexible and adequately adjust public good investments in fluctuating environments.",

Here, we report on short-read whole-genome sequencing and genomic analyses of LNCaP, VCaP, and PC3 cells stably transduced with WT AR (PC3-AR). LNCaP cells are composed of multiple subpopulations, which results in non-integral copy number states and a high mutational load when the data is analyzed in bulk. All three cell lines contain pathogenic mutations and homozygous deletions in genes involved in DNA mismatch repair, along with deleterious mutations in cellcycle, Wnt signaling, and other cellular processes. Furthermore, LNCaP cells contain a missense mutation in a well-known CaP hotspot of TP53, whereas both PC3-AR and VCaP have truncating mutations in TP53 and do not express p53 protein. In addition, we detect the signatures of chromothripsis of the q arms of chromosome 5 in both PC3-AR and VCaP cells, strengthening the association of TP53 inactivation with chromothripsis reported in other systems.

    "abstract": "Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are sensitized to activation by inflammatory mediators like the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) arachidonic acid (AA). Previous work has shown that AA can potentiate ASIC currents at subsaturating proton concentrations, but the structural mechanisms of this change in gating are not understood. Here we show that PUFAs cause multiple gating changes in ASIC3 including shifting the pH dependence of activation, slowing the rate of desensitization, and increasing the current even at a saturating pH. The impact on gating depends on the nature of both the head and tail of the lipid with the head group structure primarily determining the magnitude of the effect on the channel. An N-acyl amino acid (NAAA), arachidonoyl glycine (AG), is such a strong regulator that it can act as a ligand at neutral pH. Mutation of an arginine in the outer segment of TM1 (R64) eliminated the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) even at high concentrations suggesting a potential interaction site for the lipid on the channel. Our results suggest a model where PUFAs bind to ASICs both via their tail group as well as an electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged PUFA head group and the positively charged arginine side chain. These data provide the first look at the structural features of lipids that are important for modulating ASICs and suggest a potential binding site for PUFAs on the channel.\n\nShort SummaryArachidonic acid (AA) is a known modulator of ASICs. Bankston and Klipp examine the structural requirements for ASIC modulation by a number of lipids related to AA. Negatively charged head groups are stronger potentiators and may interact with an arginine in TM1 near the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane.",

    "abstract": "Nutrient acquisition and metabolism pathways are altered in cancer cells to meet bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands. A major regulator of cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis, in normal and cancer cells, is AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK influences cell growth via its modulation of the mechanistic target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, specifically, by inhibiting mTOR complex mTORC1, which facilitates cell proliferation, and by activating mTORC2 and cell survival. Given its conflicting roles, the effects of AMPK activation in cancer can be counter-intuitive. Prior to the establishment of cancer, AMPK acts as a tumor suppressor. However, following the onset of cancer, AMPK has been shown to either suppress or promote cancer, depending on cell type or state. To unravel the controversial roles of AMPK in cancer, we developed a computational model to simulate the effects of pharmacological maneuvers that target key metabolic signalling nodes, with specific focus on AMPK, mTORC, and their modulators. Model simulations clarify the competing effects and the roles of key metabolic signalling pathways in tumorigenesis, which may yield insights on innovative therapeutic strategies.",

In this context, systems of living cells can be thought of as intelligent entities. Here, we show that the concepts of non-equilibrium tuning and compartmentalization are sufficient to model manifestations of cellular intelligence such as specialization, division, fusion and communication using the language of operads. We implement our framework as an unsupervised learning algorithm, IO_SCPLOWNTC_SCPLOWCO_SCPLOWYTC_SCPLOW, which we show is able to memorize, organize and abstract reference machine-learning datasets through generative and self-supervised tasks.

In this context, systems of living cells can be thought of as intelligent entities. While one can reasonably describe their adaptive abilities within the realm of homeostatic mechanisms, it is challenging to comprehend the principles governing their metabolic intelligence. In each organism, cells have indeed developed as many ways to adapt as there are cell types, and elucidating the impetus of their evolutionary behaviors could be the key to understanding life processes and likely diseases.\n\nAdvancesThe goal of this article is to propose principles for understanding cellular intelligence. Specifically, we show that the concepts of non-equilibrium tuning and compartmentalization are enough to recover cellular adaptive behaviors such as specialization, division, fusion, and communication. Our model has the advantage to encompass all scales of life, from organelles to organisms through systems of organs and cell assemblies. We achieve this flexibility using the language of operads, which provides an elegant framework for reasoning about nested systems and, as an emergent behavior, non-equilibrium compartmentalization.\n\nTo demonstrate the validity and the practical utility of our model, we implement it in the form of an unsupervised learning algorithm, IO_SCPLOWNTC_SCPLOWCO_SCPLOWYTC_SCPLOW, and apply it to reference machine learning datasets through generative and self-supervised tasks. We find that IO_SCPLOWNTC_SCPLOWCO_SCPLOWYTC_SCPLOWs interpretability, plasticity and accuracy surpass that of a wide range of machine learning algorithms, thus providing a powerful approach for data mining.\n\nOutlookOur results indicate that the nested hierarchical language of operads captures the emergent properties of programmed cellular metabolism in the development of living systems, and provide a new biologically-inspired, yet practical and lightweight, computational paradigm for memorizing, organizing and abstracting datasets.",

    "abstract": "Cell plasticity operates alongside other sources of cell-to-cell heterogeneity, such as genetic mutations and variation in signaling, together preventing most cancer therapies from being curative. The predominant methods of quantifying tumor-drug response operate on snapshot, population-level measurements and therefore lack evolutionary dynamics, which are particularly critical for dynamic processes such as plasticity. Here we apply a lineage tree-based adaptation of a hidden Markov model that employs single cell lineages as input to learn the characteristic patterns of single cell phenotypic heterogeneity and state transitions in an unsupervised fashion. To benchmark our model, we paired cell fate with either cell lifetimes or individual cell cycle phase lengths on synthetic data and demonstrated that the model successfully classifies cells within experimentally tractable dataset sizes. As an application, we analyzed experimental measurements of same measurements in cancer and non-cancer cell populations under various treatments. We find that in each case multiple phenotypically distinct states exist, with significant heterogeneity and unique drug responses. In total, this framework allows for the flexible classification of single cell heterogeneity across lineages.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive-relevant information is processed by different brain areas that cooperate to eventually produce a response. The relationship between local activity and global brain states during such processes, however, remains for the most part unexplored. To address this question, we designed a simple face-recognition task performed in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and monitored with intracranial EEG. Based on our observations, we developed a novel analytical framework (named \"local-global\" framework) to statistically correlate the brain activity in every recorded gray-matter region with the widespread connectivity fluctuations as proxy to identify concurrent local activations and global brain phenomena that may plausibly reflect a common functional network during cognition. The application of the local-global framework to the data from 3 subjects showed that similar connectivity fluctuations found across patients were mainly coupled to the local activity of brain areas involved in face information processing. In particular, our findings provide preliminary evidence that the reported global measures might be a novel signature of functional brain activity reorganization when a stimulus is processed in a task context regardless of the specific recorded areas.\n\nData availability statementDue to institutional restrictions, the data that supports the findings of this study can be accessed only with a data sharing agreement.

    "abstract": "Aesthetic experiences have an influence on many aspects of life. Interest in the neural basis of aesthetic experiences has grown rapidly in the past decade, and fMRI studies have identified several brain systems supporting aesthetic experiences. Work on the rapid neuronal dynamics of aesthetic experience, however, is relatively scarce. The present study adds to this field by investigating the experience of being aesthetically moved by means of ERP and time-frequency analysis. Participants EEG was recorded while they viewed a diverse set of artworks and evaluated the extent to which these artworks moved them. Results show that being aesthetically moved is associated with a sustained increase in gamma activity over centroparietal regions. Also, alpha power over right frontocentral regions was reduced in high and low moving images, compared to artworks given intermediate ratings. We interpret the gamma effect as an indication for sustained savoring processes for aesthetically moving artworks compared to aesthetically less moving artworks. The alpha effect is interpreted as an indication of increased attention for aesthetically salient images. In contrast to previous works, we observed no significant effects in any of the established ERP components, but we did observe effects at latencies longer than 1 s. We conclude that EEG time-frequency analysis provides useful information on the neuronal dynamics of aesthetic experience.",

We combined ensembles of convolutional neural networks with Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to detect which brain features contribute to BA. Trained on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of a population-based study (n=2637, 18-82 years), our models estimated age accurately based on single and multiple modalities, regionally restricted and whole-brain images (mean absolute errors 3.37-3.86 years). We find that BA estimates capture aging at both small and large-scale changes, revealing gross enlargements of ventricles and subarachnoid spaces, as well as white matter lesions, and atrophies that appear throughout the brain. Divergence from expected aging reflected cardiovascular risk factors and accelerated aging was more pronounced in the frontal lobe. Applying LRP, our study demonstrates how superior deep learning models detect brain-aging in healthy and at-risk individuals throughout adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Tardigrades, which live in transiently wet environments such as moss, are well-known for their extreme resistance to desiccation. Tardigrade intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) have been reported to also protect bacteria and yeast under desiccation [4, 5, 32]. In this study, we utilized lyophilization to achieve room-temperature storage of engineered bacteria. By using TDPs, engineered bacteria are protected under lyophilization and their original functions are preserved [12, 17, 18]. This study shows that TDPs can be expressed in the Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21 and DH5, and bacteria treated with Cytosolic-abundant heat soluble protein (CAHS) 106094 displayed the highest survival rate after lyophilization [16, 41, 44]. Moreover, this study shows that the co-expression of TDPs can improve the preservation of bacteria and maintain high survival rates after prolonged room temperature storage. Additionally, the TDPs can be expressed using different vectors, which means that they can be used in different types of engineered bacteria. This study offers a new storage method that not only improves the storage of biological material for industrial and daily usage, but also for future iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition) teams to store and use their engineered bacteria in different applications.",
