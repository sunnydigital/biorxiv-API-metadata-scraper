    "abstract": "Mapping the dynamics of immune cell populations over time or disease-course is key to understanding immunopathogenesis and devising putative interventions. We present TrackSOM, an algorithm which delineates cellular populations and tracks their development over a time- or disease-course of cytometry datasets. We demonstrate TrackSOM-enabled elucidation of the immune response to West Nile Virus infection in mice, uncovering heterogeneous sub-populations of immune cells and relating their functional evolution to disease severity. TrackSOM is easy to use, encompasses few parameters, is quick to execute, and enables an integrative and dynamic overview of the immune system kinetics that underlie disease progression and/or resolution.",

    "abstract": "Breast and pancreatic tumours are embedded in a collagen I-rich extracellular matrix (ECM) network, where nutrients are scarce due to limited blood flow and elevated tumour growth. Metabolic adaptation is required for cancer cells to endure these conditions. Here, we demonstrated that the presence of ECM supported the growth of invasive breast cancer cells, but not non-transformed mammary epithelial cells, and pancreatic cancer cells under amino acid starvation, through a mechanism that required macropinocytosis-dependent ECM uptake. Importantly, we showed that this behaviour was acquired during carcinoma progression. ECM internalisation, followed by lysosomal degradation, contributed to the upregulation of the intracellular levels of several amino acids, most notably tyrosine and phenylalanine. This resulted in elevated tyrosine catabolism on ECM under starvation, leading to increased fumarate levels, potentially feeding into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Interestingly, this pathway was required for ECM-dependent cell growth under amino acid starvation, as the knockdown of p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate hydroxylase-like protein (HPDL), the third enzyme of the pathway, opposed cell growth on ECM in both 2D and 3D systems, without affecting cell proliferation on plastic. Finally, high HPDL expression correlated with poor prognosis in breast and pancreatic cancer patients. Collectively, our results highlight that the ECM in the tumour microenvironment represents an alternative source of nutrients to support cancer cell growth, by regulating phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary dynamics allows us to understand many changes happening in a broad variety of biological systems, ranging from individuals to complete ecosystems. It is also behind a number of remarkable organizational changes that happen during the natural history of cancers. These reflect tumour heterogeneity, which is present at all cellular levels, including the genome, proteome and phenome, shaping its development and interrelation with its environment. An intriguing observation in different cohorts of oncological patients is that tumours exhibit an increased proliferation as the disease progresses, while the timescales involved are apparently too short for the fixation of sufficient driver mutations to promote an explosive growth. Here we discuss how phenotypic plasticity, emerging from a single genotype, may play a key role and provide a ground for a continuous acceleration of the proliferation rate of clonal populations with time. We address this question by combining the analysis of real time growth of non-small-cell lung carcinoma cells (line NCI-H460) together with stochastic and deterministic mathematical models that capture proliferation trait heterogeneity in clonal populations to elucidate the contribution of phenotypic transitions on tumour growth dynamics.",

These models exclude key rate limiting steps, and hence it is unclear why they are able to accurately predict the number distributions. To answer this question, here we compare these models to a novel stochastic mechanistic model of transcription in mammalian cells that presents a unified description of transcriptional factor, polymerase and mature mRNA dynamics. We show that there is a large region of parameter space where the first, second and third moments of the distributions of the waiting times between two consecutively produced transcripts (nascent or mature) of two-state and mechanistic models exactly match. In this region, (i) one can uniquely express the two-state model parameters in terms of those of the mechanistic model, (ii) the models are practically indistinguishable by comparison of their transcript numbers distributions, and (iii) they are distinguishable from the shape of their waiting time distributions. Our results clarify the relationship between different gene expression models and identify a means to select between them from experimental data.",

Here, we report the unique active escape behavior of Japanese eel Anguilla japonica juveniles through the gill cleft of the predatory fish Odontobutis obscura. Of the 54 A. japonica juveniles captured by the predator, 28 escaped via the predators gill, and most escaped individuals survived afterwards. In all escaped individuals, their tails emerged first from the gill cleft of the predator, and then their whole bodies slipped out in a backward direction from the cleft. These findings indicate that A. japonica juveniles have the specialized antipredator tactic, which provides the basis for further investigation from behavioral, ecological, and evolutionary perspectives.",

    "abstract": "We have shown that deficiency of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), an enzyme generating the sphingolipid ceramide, improves memory in adult mice. Here, we performed sphingolipid and RNA-seq analyses on the cortex from 10 month-old nSMase2-deficient (fro/fro) and heterozygous (+/fro) mice. fro/fro cortex showed reduced levels of ceramide, particularly in astrocytes. Differentially abundant transcripts included several functionally related groups, with decreases in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and astrocyte activation transcripts, while axon guidance and synaptic transmission transcripts were increased, indicating a role of nSMase2 in oxidative stress, astrocyte activation, and cognition. Experimentally induced oxidative stress decreased the level of glutathione (GSH), an endogenous inhibitor of nSMase2, and increased immunolabeling for ceramide in primary +/fro astrocytes, but not in fro/fro astrocytes. {beta}-galactosidase activity was lower in 5-weeks old fro/fro astrocytes, indicating delayed senescence due to nSMase2 deficiency. In fro/fro cortex, levels of the senescence markers C3b and p27, and the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1{beta}, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor  were reduced, concurrent with 2-fold decreased phosphorylation of their downstream target, protein kinase Stat3. RNA and protein levels of the ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit 2b (Grin2b or NR2B) were increased by 2-fold, an effect known to enhance cognition. This was consistent with 3.5-fold reduced levels of exosomes carrying miR-223-3p, a micro-RNA downregulating Grin2b. In summary, our data show that nSMase2 deficiency prevents oxidative stress-induced elevation of ceramide and secretion of exosomes by astrocytes that suppress neuronal function, indicating a role of nSMase2 in the regulation of neuroinflammation and cognition during brain aging.\n\nSignificance statementOxidative stress is associated with brain aging and cognitive decline. The underlying mechanism how oxidative stress impairs brain function is still not clear. We provide evidence that oxidative stress increases ceramide in astrocytes, which is prevented by deficiency of nSMase2, an enzyme that is activated by oxidative stress and generates ceramide from sphingomyelin. Mass spectrometric and transciptomic (RNA-seq) analyses show that in middle aged (10-month old) mouse cortex, nSMase2 deficiency reduces ceramide and increases expression of genes important for synaptic transmission and cognition. Therefore, our data show that oxidative stress-induced activation of nSMase2 and generation of ceramide is significant for cognitive decline during aging.",

    "abstract": "Large vessel disease and carotid stenosis are key mechanisms contributing to vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and dementia. Our previous work, and that of others, using rodent models, demonstrated that bilateral common carotid stenosis (BCAS) leads to cognitive impairment via gradual deterioration of the glial-vascular unit and accumulation of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) protein. Since brain-wide drainage pathways (glymphatic) for waste clearance, including A{beta} removal, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of VCI via glial mechanisms, we hypothesized that glymphatic function would be impaired in a BCAS model and exacerbated in the presence of A{beta}. Male wild- type and Tg-SwDI (model of microvascular amyloid) mice were subjected to BCAS or sham surgery which led to a reduction in cerebral perfusion and impaired spatial learning and memory. After 3 months survival, glymphatic function was evaluated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fluorescent tracer influx. We demonstrated that BCAS caused a marked regional reduction of CSF tracer influx in the dorsolateral cortex and CA1-DG molecular layer. In parallel to these changes increased reactive astrogliosis was observed post-BCAS. To further investigate the mechanisms that may lead to these changes, we measured the pulsation of cortical vessels. BCAS impaired vascular pulsation in pial arteries in WT and Tg-SwDI mice. Since our findings show that BCAS may influence VCI by impaired glymphatic drainage and reduced vascular pulsation we propose that these additional targets need to be considered when treating VCI.",

    "abstract": "Early electrophysiological brain oscillations recorded in preterm babies and newborn rodents are initially mostly ignited by bottom-up sensorimotor activity and only later can detach from external inputs. This is a hallmark of most developing brain areas including the hippocampus, which in the adult brain, functions in integrating external inputs onto internal dynamics. Such developmental disengagement from external inputs is likely a fundamental step for the proper development of cognitive internal models. Despite its importance, the developmental timeline and circuit basis for this disengagement remain unknown. To address this issue, we have investigated the daily evolution of CA1 dynamics and underlying circuits during the first two postnatal weeks of mouse development using two-photon calcium imaging in non-anesthetized pups. We show that the first postnatal week ends with an abrupt shift in the representation of self-motion in CA1. Indeed, most CA1 pyramidal cells switch from activated to inhibited by self-generated movements at the end of the first postnatal week whereas the majority of GABAergic neurons remain positively modulated throughout this period. This rapid switch occurs within two days and follows the rapid anatomical and functional surge of local somatic GABAergic innervation. The observed change in dynamics is consistent with a two-population model undergoing a strengthening of inhibition. We propose that this abrupt developmental transition inaugurates the emergence of internal cognitive models.",

    "abstract": "Nearly 50 different mouse retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types sample the visual scene for distinct features. RGC feature selectivity arises from its synapses with a specific subset of amacrine (AC) and bipolar cell (BC) types, but how RGC dendrites arborize and collect input from these specific subsets remains poorly understood. Here we examine the hypothesis that RGCs employ molecular recognition systems to meet this challenge. By combining calcium imaging and type-specific histological stains we define a family of circuits that express the recognition molecule Sidekick 1 (Sdk1) which include a novel RGC type (S1-RGC) that responds to local edges. Genetic and physiological studies revealed that Sdk1 loss selectively disrupts S1-RGC visual responses which result from a loss of excitatory and inhibitory inputs and selective dendritic deficits on this neuron. We conclude that Sdk1 shapes dendrite growth and wiring to help S1-RGCs become feature selective.",

We previously revealed major enzymes and intermediate compounds in A,B-ring cleavage, {beta}-oxidation cycle of the cleaved B-ring, and partial C,D-ring cleavage process. Here, we elucidated the C-ring cleavage and the {beta}-oxidation cycle that follows. ScdL1L2, a 3-ketoacid Coenzyme A (CoA) transferase which belongs to the SugarP_isomerase superfamily, was thought to cleave the C-ring of 9-oxo-1,2,3,4,5,6,10,19-octanor-13,17-secoandrost-8(14)-ene-7,17-dioic acid-CoA ester, the key intermediate compound in the degradation of 9,17-dioxo-1,2,3,4,10,19-hexanorandrostan-5-oic acid (3a-H-4 [3'-propionic acid]-7a{beta}-methylhexahydro-1,5-indanedione; HIP)-CoA ester in the previous study; however, this study suggested that ScdL1L2 is the isomerase of the derivative with a hydroxyl group at C-14 which cleaves C ring. The subsequent ring-cleaved product was indicated to be converted to 4-methyl-5-oxo-octane-1,8-dioic acid-CoA ester mainly by ORF33-encoded CoA-transferase (named ScdJ), followed by dehydrogenation by ORF21 and 22-encoded acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (named ScdM1M2). Then a water molecule is added by ScdN for further degradation by {beta}-oxidation. ScdN is considered to catalyze the last reaction in C,D-ring degradation by the enzymes encoded in the steroid degradation gene cluster tesB to tesR.\n\nIMPORTANCEStudies on bacterial steroid degradation were initiated more than 50 years ago primarily to obtain materials for steroid drugs. Steroid-degrading bacteria are globally distributed, and the role of bacterial steroid degradation in the environment as well as in human is attracting attention. The overall degradation of steroidal four rings is proposed, however there are still much to be revealed to understand the complete degradation pathway. This study aims to uncover the whole steroid degradation process in C. testosteroni, which is one of the most studied representative steroid degrading bacteria and is suitable for exploring the degradation pathway because the involvement of degradation-related genes can be determined by gene disruption.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present work was to identify microbial biomarkers linked to immunity traits and to characterize the contribution of host-genome and gut microbiota to the immunocompetence in healthy pigs. To achieve this goal, we undertook a combination of network, mixed model and microbial-wide association studies (MWAS) for 21 immunity traits and the relative abundance of gut bacterial communities in 389 pigs genotyped for 70K SNPs. The heritability (h2; proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the host genetics) and microbiability (m2; proportion of variance explained by the microbial composition) showed similar values for most of the analyzed immunity traits, except for both IgM and IgG in plasma that were dominated by the host genetics, and the haptoglobin in serum which was the trait with larger m2 (0.275) compared to h2 (0.138). Results from the MWAS suggested a polymicrobial nature of the immunocompetence in pigs and revealed associations between pigs gut microbiota composition and 15 of the analyzed traits. The lymphocytes phagocytic capacity (quantified as mean fluorescence) and the total number of monocytes in blood were the traits associated with the largest number of taxa (6 taxa). Among the associations identified by MWAS, 30% were confirmed by an information theory network approach. The strongest confirmed associations were between Fibrobacter and phagocytic capacity of lymphocytes (r=0.37), followed by correlations between Streptococcus and the percentage of phagocytic lymphocytes (r=-0.34) and between Megasphaera and serum concentration of haptoglobin (r=0.26). In the interaction network, Streptococcus and percentage of phagocytic lymphocytes were the keystone bacterial and immune-trait, respectively. Overall, our findings reveal an important connection between immunity traits and gut microbiota in pigs and highlight the need to consider both sources of information, host genome and microbial levels, to accurately characterize immunocompetence in pigs.",

    "abstract": "Species of the genus Pseudomonas are used for several biotechnological purposes, including plant biocontrol and bioremediation. To exploit the Pseudomonas genus in environmental, agricultural or industrial settings, the organisms must be profiled at species level as their bioactivity potential differs markedly between species. Standard 16S rRNA gene amplicon profiling does not allow for accurate species differentiation. Thus, the purpose of this study was to develop an amplicon-based high-resolution method targeting a 760 nt region of the rpoD gene enabling taxonomic differentiation of Pseudomonas species in soil samples. The method was benchmarked on a sixteen membered Pseudomonas species mock community. All 16 species were correctly and semi-quantitatively identified using rpoD gene amplicons, whereas 16S rRNA V3V4 amplicon sequencing only correctly identified one species. We analysed the Pseudomonas profile in thirteen soil samples in northern Zealand, Denmark, where samples were collected from grassland (3 samples) and agriculture soil (10 samples). Pseudomonas species represented up to 0.7% of the microbial community, of which each sampling site contained a unique Pseudomonas composition. Thirty culturable Pseudomonas strains were isolated from each grassland site and ten from each agriculture site and identified by Sanger sequencing of the rpoD gene. In all cases, the rpoD-amplicon approach identified more species than found by cultivation, including hard-to-culture non-fluorescent pseudomonads, as well as more than found by 16S rRNA V3V4 amplicon sequencing. Thus, rpoD profiling can be used for species profiling of Pseudomonas, and large scale prospecting of bioactive Pseudomonas may be guided by initial screening using this method.\n\nImportanceA high throughput sequence-based method for profiling of Pseudomonas species in soil microbiomes was developed and identified more species than 16S rRNA gene sequencing or cultivation. Pseudomonas species are used as biocontrol organisms and plant-growth promoting agents, and the method will allow tracing of specific species of Pseudomonas as well as enable screening of environmental samples for further isolation and exploitation.",

    "abstract": "Nosocomial infection associated with Elizabethkingia spp. is an emerging clinical concern characterized by multi-drug resistance and severe clinical consequences particularly in immunocompromised individuals and infants. Efficient control of this infection demands quick and reliable methods to determine the right drugs for the treatment. In this study, E. meningoseptica ATCC 13253 and four clinical isolates of Elizabethkingia spp. obtained from China, were subjected to single cell Raman spectroscopy analysis coupling with deuterium probing (single cell Raman-DIP). The results demonstrated that single cell Raman-DIP could generate an antimicrobial susceptibility testing result for Elizabethkingia spp. colonies within 4 hours based on their metabolisms variations at single cell level, and the drug resistant spectra of Elizabethkingia spp. determined by single cell Raman-DIP were consistent with the classical MIC method. Meanwhile single cell Raman spectroscopy (single cell RS) was applied to analyze Raman spectra of Elizabethkingia spp., which were revealed that their ratios of nucleic acid/protein were lower than other gram-negative pathogens and isolates from different origins could be distinguished by their Raman fingerprint. The in vitro results confirmed that minocycline and levofloxacin are first-line antimicrobials for Elizabethkingia spp. infection.",

It accomplishes this by dividing the conversion into three main phases: parallel composition of the monomer backbone, assembly of backbone subunits, and parallel elongation of sidechains; and by batching these computations into a minimal number of efficient matrix operations.

    "abstract": "Area of Habitat (AOH) is defined as the  habitat available to a species, that is, habitat within its range and is produced by subtracting areas of unsuitable land cover and elevation from the range. Habitat associations are documented using the IUCN Habitats Classification Scheme, and unvalidated expert opinion has been used so far to match habitat to land-cover classes generating a source of uncertainty in AOH maps. We develop a data-driven method to translate IUCN habitat classes to land-cover based on point locality data for 6,986 species of terrestrial mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles. We extracted the land-cover class at each point locality and matched it to the IUCN habitat class(es) assigned to each species occurring there. Then we modelled each land cover class as a function of IUCN habitat using logistic regression models. The resulting odds ratios were used to assess the strength of the association of each habitat land-cover class. We then compared the performance of our data-driven model with those from a published expert knowledge translation table. The results show that some habitats (e.g. forest and desert) could be more confidently assigned to land-cover classes than others (e.g. wetlands and artificial). We calculated the association between habitat classes and land-cover classes as a continuous variable, but to map AOH, which is in the form of a binary presence/absence, it is necessary to apply a threshold of association. This can be chosen by the user according to the required balance between omission and commission errors. We demonstrate that a data-driven translation model and expert knowledge perform equally well, but the model provides greater standardization, objectivity and repeatability. Furthermore, this approach allows greater flexibility in the use of the results and allows uncertainty to be quantified. Our model can be developed regionally or for different taxonomic groups.",

    "abstract": "Herbivores play an integral part in maintaining the health of coral reefs by suppressing the growth of algae and accumulation of sediment and facilitating coral growth. However, in predator-depleted systems where densities of herbivores are unnaturally high, grazing can have detrimental effects on corals through excessive bioerosion. Yet, these benefits and costs are rarely investigated concurrently, especially in eutrophic systems where grazers may play a disproportionate role. We used a year-long exclusion experiment to elucidate the effect of natural densities of the dominant herbivore (the sea urchin Diadema setosum) on coral communities in a heavily fished and eutrophic system (Hong Kong, China). To assess benthic community response to grazing, we monitored the survival and growth of three locally abundant coral species (Pavona decussata, Platygyra carnosus and Porites sp.), algal and sediment accumulation, and bioerosion of coral skeletons across seasons. We found that urchins maintained our experimental coral assemblages, and when excluded, there was a 25 to 75-fold increase in algal-sediment matrix accumulation. Contrary to predictions, there was no general response of corals to urchin presence; Porites sp. survivorship increased while P. decussata was unaffected, and growth rates of both species was unchanged. Surprisingly, P. carnosus experienced higher mortality and bioerosion of up to 33% of their buoyant weight when urchins were present. Therefore, under natural densities, sea urchins clear substrate of algae and sediment, increase survival, maintain growth rates and health of coral assemblages, yet can accelerate the bioerosion of species with porous skeletons following mortality.",

    "abstract": "Disease control can induce both demographic and evolutionary responses in host-parasite systems. Foreseeing the outcome of control therefore requires knowledge of the eco-evolutionary feedback between control and system. Previous work has assumed that control strategies have a homogeneous effect on the parasite population. However, this is not true when control targets those traits that confer to the parasite heterogeneous levels of resistance, which can additionally be related to other key parasite traits, through evolutionary trade-offs. In this work, we develop a minimal model coupling epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics to explore possible trait-dependent effects of control strategies. Particularly, we consider a parasite expressing continuous levels of a trait determining resource exploitation, and a control treatment that can be either positively or negatively correlated with that trait. We demonstrate the potential of trait-dependent control by considering that the decision maker may want to minimise both the damage caused by the disease and the use of treatment, due to possible environmental or economic costs. We identify efficient strategies showing that the optimal type of treatment depends on the amount applied. Our results pave the way for the study of control strategies based on evolutionary constraints, such as collateral sensitivity and resistance costs, which are receiving increasing attention for both public health and agricultural purposes.",

    "abstract": "Aphids are the primary vector of plant viruses. Transient aphids, which probe several plants per day, are considered to be the principal vectors of non-persistently transmitted (NPT) viruses. However, resident aphids, which can complete their life cycle on a single host and are affected by agronomic practices, can transmit NPT viruses as well. Moreover, they can interfere both directly and indirectly with transient aphids, eventually shaping plant disease dynamics. By mean of an epidemiological model, originally accounting for ecological principles and agronomic practices, we explore the consequences of fertilization and irrigation, pesticide deployment and roguing of infected plants on the spread of viral diseases in crops. Our results indicate that the spread of NPT viruses can be i) both reduced or increased by fertilization and irrigation, depending on whether the interference is direct or indirect; ii) counter-intuitively increased by pesticide application and iii) reduced by roguing infected plants. We show that a better understanding of vectors interactions would enhance our understanding of disease transmission, supporting the development of disease management strategies.\n\nAuthor summaryA range of both experimental and theoretical studies show that the behaviour and population dynamics of insects depend strongly upon interactions with other insect species. These interactions have the potential to greatly affect the dynamics of insect-vectored plant disease, as transmission of viruses is intimately dependent on the local density of vectors, as well as how they select and move between potential host plants. Surprisingly, the effects of interaction between vector species on epidemics remains little studied and even worse understood, probably because experimentation is costly and difficult. Here, we present a model which permits to investigate the effect of interaction between a virus, two vector species, and the host plant on the spread of viral disease in crops. In this study, our model is used to explore the consequences of common agronomic practices on epidemics. Our study highlights the importance of exploring vectors interactions to enhance the understanding of disease transmission, supporting the development of disease management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Gray mold, a disease of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) caused by the ubiquitous necrotroph Botrytis cinerea, renders fruit unmarketable and causes economic losses in the postharvest supply chain. To explore the feasibility of selecting for increased resistance to gray mold, we undertook genetic and genomic prediction studies in strawberry populations segregating for fruit quality and shelf life traits hypothesized to pleiotropically affect susceptibility. As predicted, resistance to gray mold was heritable but quantitative genetically complex. While every individual was susceptible, the speed of symptom progression and severity differed. Narrow-sense heritability ranged from 0.38-0.71 for lesion diameter (LD) and 0.39-0.44 for speed of emergence of external mycelium (EM). Even though significant additive genetic variation was genome wide observed for LD and EM, the phenotypic ranges were comparatively narrow and genome-wide analyses did not identify any large effect loci. Genomic selection accuracy ranged from 0.28-0.59 for LD and 0.37-0.47 for EM. Additive genetic correlations between fruit quality and gray mold resistance traits were consistent with prevailing hypotheses: LD decreased as titratable acidity increased, whereas EM increased as soluble solid whole genome content decreased and firmness increased. We concluded that phenotypic and genomic selection could be regression effective for reducing LD and increasing EM, especially in long shelf life populations, but that a significant fraction of the genetic variation for resistance to gray mold was caused by the pleiotropic effects of fruit quality traits that differ among market and shelf life classes.",

    "abstract": "Arabidopsis thaliana is an important and long-established model species for plant molecular biology, genetics, epigenetics, and genomics. However, the latest version of reference genome still contains significant number of missing segments. Here, we report a high-quality and almost complete Col-0 genome assembly with two gaps (Col-XJTU) using combination of Oxford Nanopore Technology ultra-long reads, PacBio high-fidelity long reads, and Hi-C data. The total genome assembly size is 133,725,193 bp, introducing 14.6 Mb of novel sequences compared to the TAIR10.1 reference genome. All five chromosomes of Col-XJTU assembly are highly accurate with consensus quality (QV) scores > 60 (ranging from 62 to 68), which are higher than those of TAIR10.1 reference (QV scores ranging from 45 to 52). We have completely resolved chromosome (Chr) 3 and Chr5 in a telomere-to-telomere manner. Chr4 has been completely resolved except the nucleolar organizing regions, which comprise long repetitive DNA fragments. The Chr1 centromere (CEN1), reportedly around 9 Mb in length, is particularly challenging to assemble due to the presence of tens of thousands of CEN180 satellite repeats. Using the cutting-edge sequencing data and novel computational approaches, we assembled about 4 Mb of sequence for CEN1 and a 3.5-Mb-long CEN2. We investigated the structure and epigenetics of centromeres. We detected four clusters of CEN180 monomers, and found that the centromere-specific histone H3-like protein (CENH3) exhibits a strong preference for CEN180 cluster 3. Moreover, we observed hypomethylation patterns in CENH3-enriched regions. We believe that this high-quality genome assembly, Col-XJTU, would serve as a valuable reference to better understand the global pattern of centromeric polymorphisms, as well as genetic and epigenetic features in plants.",

    "abstract": "Linkage disequilibrium and disease-associated variants in non-coding regions make it difficult to distinguish truly associated genes from redundantly associated genes for complex diseases. In this study, we proposed a new conditional gene-based framework called MCGA that leveraged an improved effective chi-squared statistic to control the type I error rates and remove the redundant associations. MCGA initially integrated two conventional strategies to map genetic variants to genes, i.e., mapping a variant to its physically nearby gene and mapping a variant to a gene if the variant is a gene-level expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) of the gene. We further performed a simulation study and demonstrated that the isoform-level eQTL was more powerful than the gene-level eQTL in the association analysis. Then the third strategy, i.e., mapping a variant to a gene if the variant is an isoform-level eQTL of the gene, was also integrated with MCGA. We applied MCGA to predict the potential susceptibility genes of schizophrenia and found that the potential susceptibility genes identified by MCGA were enriched with many neuronal or synaptic signaling-related terms in the Gene Ontology knowledgebase and antipsychotics-gene interaction terms in the drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb). More importantly, nine susceptibility genes were the target genes of multiple approved antipsychotics in DrugBank. Comparing the susceptibility genes identified by the above three strategies implied that strategy based on isoform-level eQTL could be an important supplement for the other two strategies and help predict more candidate susceptibility isoforms and genes for complex diseases in a multi-tissue context.",

The role of Type I MADS-box TFs in angiosperm evolution remains to be identified. Here, we show that the formation of angiosperm-specific Type I MADS-box clades of M{gamma} and M{gamma}-interacting M genes (M*) can be tracked back to the ancestor of all angiosperms. Angiosperm-specific M{gamma} and M* genes were preferentially expressed in the endosperm, consistent with their proposed function as heterodimers in the angiosperm-specific embryo-nourishing endosperm tissue. We propose that duplication and diversification of Type I MADS-genes underpins the evolution of the endosperm, a developmental innovation closely connected to the origin and success of angiosperms.",

    "abstract": "Despite decades of extensive study, the role of cuticular lipids in sustaining plant fitness is far from being understood. To answer this fundamental question, we employed genome editing in tree tobacco (Nicotiana glauca) plants and generated mutations in 16 different cuticular lipids-related genes. We chose tree tobacco due to the abundant, yet simply composed epicuticular waxes deposited on its surface. Five out of 9 different mutants that displayed a cuticular lipids-related phenotype were selected for in depth analysis. They had either reduced total wax load or complete deficiency in certain wax components. This led to substantial modification in surface wax crystal structure and to elevated cuticular water loss. Remarkably, under non-stressed conditions, mutant plants with altered wax composition did not display elevated transpiration or reduced growth. However, once exposed to drought, plants lacking alkanes were not able to strongly reduce their transpiration, leading to leaf death and impaired recovery upon resuscitation, and even to stem cracking, a phenomenon typically found in trees experiencing drought stress. In contrast, plants deficient in fatty alcohols exhibited an opposite response, having reduced cuticular water loss and rapid recovery following drought. This differential response was part of a larger trend, of no common phenotype connecting plants with a glossy appearance. We conclude that alkanes are essential under drought response and much less under normal non-stressed conditions, enabling plants to seal their cuticle upon stomatal closure, reducing leaf death and facilitating a speedy recovery.",

    "abstract": "The 5UTR of the Hepatitis C Virus genome forms RNA structures that regulate virus replication and translation. The region contains a viral internal ribosomal entry site and a 5 terminal region. Binding of the liver specific miRNA, miR-122, to two conserved binding sites in the 5 terminal region regulates viral replication, translation, and genome stability, and is essential for efficient virus replication, but its precise mechanism of its action is still under debate. A current hypothesis is that miR-122 binding stimulates viral translation by facilitating the viral 5 UTR to form the translationally active HCV IRES RNA structure. While miR-122 is essential for detectable virus replication in cell culture, several viral variants with 5 UTR mutations exhibit low level replication in the absence of miR-122. We show that HCV mutants capable of replicating independently of miR-122 also replicate independently of other microRNAs generated by the canonical miRNA synthesis pathway. Further, we also show that the mutant genomes display an enhanced translation phenotype that correlates with their ability to replicate independently of miR-122. Finally, we provide evidence that translation regulation is the major role for miR-122, and show that miR-122-independent HCV replication can be rescued to miR-122-dependent levels by the combined impacts of 5 UTR mutations that stimulate translation, and by stabilizing the viral genome by knockdown of host exonucleases and phosphatases that degrade the genome. Thus, we provide a model suggesting that translation stimulation and genome stabilization are the primary roles for miR-122 in the virus life cycle.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe unusual role of miR-122 in promoting HCV propagation is incompletely understood but is essential for an HCV infection. To better understand its role, we have analyzed HCV mutants capable of replicating independently of miR-122. Our data show that the ability of viruses to replicate independently of miR-122 correlates with enhanced virus translation, but that genome stabilization is required to restore efficient HCV replication. This suggests that viruses must gain both abilities to escape the need for miR-122 and impacts the possibility that HCV can evolve to replicate outside of the liver.",

The hypothesis proposed and tested was that a regular maternal exercise of a sow during pregnancy would increase the mitochondrial efficiency of offspring heart bioenergetics. This hypothesis was tested by isolating mitochondria using a mild-isolation procedure to assess mitochondrial ETC and supercomplex profiles. The procedure described here allowed for the processing of previously frozen archived heart tissues and eliminated the necessity of fresh mitochondria preparation for the assessment of mitochondrial ETC complexes, supercomplexes, and ETC complex activity profiles. This protocol describes the optimal ETC protein complex measurement in multiplexed antibody-based immunoblotting and super complex assessment using blue-native gel electrophoresis.\n\nSUMMARYPreparation of mitochondria-enriched samples from previously frozen archived solid tissues allowed the investigators to perform both functional and analytical assessments of mitochondria in various experimental modalities. This study demonstrates how to prepare mitochondria-enriched preparations from frozen heart tissue and perform analytical assessments of mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria proficient at producing cellulose are an attractive synthetic biology host for the emerging field of Engineered Living Materials (ELMs). Species from the Komagataeibacter genus produce high yields of pure cellulose materials in a short time with minimal resources, and pioneering work has shown that genetic engineering in these strains is possible and can be used to modify the material and its production. To accelerate synthetic biology progress in these bacteria, we introduce here the Komagataeibacter tool kit (KTK), a standardised modular cloning system based on Golden Gate DNA assembly that allows DNA parts to be combined to build complex multigene constructs expressed in bacteria from plasmids. Working in Komagataeibacter rhaeticus, we describe basic parts for this system, including promoters, fusion tags and reporter proteins, before showcasing how the assembly system enables more complex designs. Specifically, we use KTK cloning to reformat the Escherichia coli curli amyloid fibre system for functional expression in K. rhaeticus, and go on to modify it as a system for programming protein secretion from the cellulose producing bacteria. With this toolkit, we aim to accelerate modular synthetic biology in these bacteria, and enable more rapid progress in the emerging ELMs community.",

    "abstract": "The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, with its devastating medical and economic impacts, triggered an unprecedented race toward development of effective vaccines. The commercialized vaccines are parenterally administered, which poses logistic challenges, while adequate protection at the mucosal sites of virus entry is questionable. Furthermore, essentially all vaccine candidates target the viral spike (S) protein, a surface protein that undergoes significant antigenic drift. This work aimed to develop an oral multi-antigen SARS-CoV-2 vaccine comprised of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral S protein, two domains of the viral nucleocapsid protein (N), and heat-labile enterotoxin B (LTB), a potent mucosal adjuvant. The humoral, mucosal and cell-mediated immune responses of both a three-dose vaccination schedule and a heterologous subcutaneous prime and oral booster regimen were assessed in mice and rats, respectively. Mice receiving the oral vaccine compared to control mice showed significantly enhanced post-dose-3 virus-neutralizing antibody, anti-S IgG and IgA production and N-protein-stimulated IFN-{gamma} and IL-2 secretion by T cells. When administered as a booster to rats following parenteral priming with the viral S1 protein, the oral vaccine elicited markedly higher neutralizing antibody titres than did oral placebo booster. A single oral booster following two subcutaneous priming doses elicited serum IgG and mucosal IgA levels similar to those raised by three subcutaneous doses. In conclusion, the oral LTB-adjuvanted multi-epitope SARS-CoV-2 vaccine triggered versatile humoral, cellular and mucosal immune responses, which are likely to provide protection, while also minimizing technical hurdles presently limiting global vaccination, whether by priming or booster programs.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMigVax-101 is a multi-epitope oral vaccine for SARS-CoV-2.\nC_LIO_LIMigVax-101 elicits neutralizing IgG and IgA production and cellular responses in mice\nC_LIO_LIMigVax-101 serves as an effective booster in rats to a parenteral anti-S1 vaccine.\nC_LI",

However, the efficacy of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, when tested in South Africa after the emergence of 501Y.V2, was not adversely impacted. We therefore assessed the binding and neutralization capacity of n=120 South African sera (from Day 29, post-vaccination) from the Janssen phase 3 study, Ensemble. Spike binding assays using both the Wuhan-1 D614G and 501Y.V2 Spikes showed high levels of cross-reactivity. In contrast, in a subset of 27 sera, we observed significantly reduced neutralization of 501Y.V2 compared to Wuhan-1 D614G, with 22/27 (82%) of sera showing no detectable neutralization of 501Y.V2 at Day 29. These data suggest that even low levels of neutralizing antibodies may contribute to protection from moderate/severe disease. In addition, Fc effector function and T cells may play an important role in protection by this vaccine against 501Y.V2.",

However, surveillance could be made more effective. We have determined that the time taken from strain collection to genome submission for over 1.7 million SARS-CoV-2 strains available at GISAID. We find that strain-wise, time lag in this process ranges from one day to over a year. Country-wise, the UK has taken a median of 16 days (for 417,287 genomes), India took 57 days (for 15,614 genomes), whereas Qatar spent 289 days (for 2298 genomes). We strongly emphasize that along with increasing the number of genomes of COVID-19 positive cases sequenced, their accelerated submission to GISAID should also be strongly encouraged and facilitated. This will enable researchers across the globe to track the spreading of variants in a timely manner; analyse their biology, epidemiology, and re-emerging infections; and define effective public health policies.",

    "abstract": "Leaf decomposition is the primary process in release nutrients in the dynamic mangrove habitat, supporting the ecosystem food webs. On most environments, fungi are an essential part of this process. However, due to the peculiarities of mangrove forests, this group is currently neglected. Thus, this study tests the hypothesis that fungal community display an specific succession pattern in different mangrove species. A molecular approach was employed to investigate the dynamics of the fungal community during the decomposition of three common plant species (Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa, and Avicennia schaueriana) from the mangrove habitat located at the southeast of Brazil. Plant material was the primary driver of fungi communities but time also was marginally significant for the process, and evident changes in the fungal community during the decomposition process were observed. The five most abundant classes common to all the three plant species were Saccharomycetes, Sordariomycetes, Tremellomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, and Dothideomycetes, all belonging to the Phylum Ascomycota. Microbotryomycetes class were shared only by A. schaueriana and L. racemosa, while Agaricomycetes class were shared by L. racemosa and R. mangle. The class Glomeromycetes were shared by A. schaueriana and R. mangle. The analysis of the core microbiome showed that Saccharomycetes was the most abundant class. In the variable community, Sordariomycetes was the most abundant one, mainly in the Laguncularia racemosa plant. The results presented in this work shows a specialization of the fungal community regarding plant material during mangrove litter decomposition.",

We have assessed vaccine-type genogroup carriage prevalence in students at the time of MenACWY vaccine introduction in The Netherlands. In addition, we evaluated the feasibility of saliva sampling and qPCR-based detection method for the surveillance of meningococcal carriage.\n\nMethodsPaired saliva and oropharyngeal samples, collected from 299 students, were cultured for meningococcus. The DNA extracted from all bacterial growth was subjected to qPCRs quantifying meningococcal presence and genogroup-specific genes. Samples negative by culture yet positive for qPCR were cultured again for meningococcus. Results for saliva were compared with oropharyngeal samples.\n\nResultsAltogether 74 (25% of 299) students were identified as meningococcal carrier by any method used. Sixty-one students (20%) were identified as carriers with qPCR. The difference between number of qPCR-positive oropharyngeal (n=59) and saliva (n=52) samples was not significant (McNemars test, p=0.07). Meningococci were cultured from 72 students (24%), with a significantly higher (p<0.001) number of oropharyngeal (n=70) compared with saliva (n=54) samples. The prevalence of genogroups A, B, C, W, and Y was none, 9%, 1% and 6%, respectively, and 8% of students carried MenACWY vaccine-type genogroup meningococci.\n\nConclusionsWe show that the detected prevalence of meningococcal carriage between oropharyngeal and saliva samples was nondifferent with qPCR and moreover, detection with both samples was highly concordant. Saliva is easy to collect and when combined with qPCR detection can be considered for meningococcal carriage studies.",

    "abstract": "Androgen excess is one of the most common endocrine disorders of reproductive-aged women, affecting up to 20% of this population. Women with elevated androgens often exhibit hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. The mechanisms of how elevated androgens affect metabolic function are not clear. Hyperandrogenemia in a dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-treated female mouse model induces whole body insulin resistance possibly through activation of the hepatic androgen receptor (AR). We investigated the role of hepatocyte AR in hyperandrogenemia-induced metabolic dysfunction by using several approaches to delete hepatic AR via animal-, cell-, and clinical-based methodologies. We conditionally disrupted hepatocyte AR in female mice developmentally (LivARKO) or acutely by tail vein injection of an adeno-associated virus with a liver-specific promoter for Cre expression in ARfl/fl mice (adLivARKO). We observed normal metabolic function in littermate female Control (ARfl/fl) and LivARKO (ARfl/fl; Cre+/-) mice. Following chronic DHT treatment, female Control mice treated with DHT (Con-DHT) developed impaired glucose tolerance, pyruvate tolerance, and insulin tolerance, not observed in LivARKO mice treated with DHT (LivARKO-DHT). Further, during an euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, the glucose infusion rate was improved in LivARKO-DHT mice compared to Con-DHT mice. Liver from LivARKO, and primary hepatocytes derived from LivARKO, and adLivARKO mice were protected from DHT-induced insulin resistance and increased gluconeogenesis. These data support a paradigm in which elevated androgens in females disrupt metabolic function via hepatic AR and insulin sensitivity was restored by deletion of hepatic AR.",

    "abstract": "The epitranscriptome plays a key regulatory role in cellular processes in health and disease, including ribosome biogenesis. Here, analysis of the human mitochondrial transcriptome shows that 2-O-methylation is limited to residues of the mitoribosomal large subunit (mtLSU) 16S mt-rRNA, modified by MRM1, MRM2, and MRM3. Ablation of MRM2 leads to a severe impairment of the oxidative phosphorylation system, caused by defective mitochondrial translation and accumulation of mtLSU assembly intermediates. Structures of these particles (2.58 [A]) present disordered RNA domains, partial occupancy of bL36m and bound MALSU1:L0R8F8:mtACP anti-association module. Additionally, we present five mtLSU assembly states with different intersubunit interface configurations. Complementation studies demonstrate that the methyltransferase activity of MRM2 is dispensable for mitoribosome biogenesis. The Drosophila melanogaster orthologue, DmMRM2, is an essential gene, with its knock-down leading to developmental arrest. This work identifies a key late-stage quality control step during mtLSU assembly, ultimately contributing to the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are involved in mediating intercellular communication processes. An important goal within the EV field is the study of the biodistribution of EVs and the identification of their target cells. Considering that EV uptake is central for mediating the EVs role in intercellular communication processes, labelling with fluorescent dyes has emerged as a broadly distributed strategy for the identification of the EVs target cells and tissues. However, the accuracy and specificity of commonly utilized labelling dyes has not been sufficiently analyzed. By combining recent advancements in imaging flow cytometry for the phenotypic analysis of single EVs and aiming to identify target cells for EVs within therapeutically relevant MSC-EV preparations, we explored the EV labelling efficacy of various fluorescent dyes, specifically of CFDA-SE, Calcein AM, PKH67, BODIPY-TR-Ceramide and a novel lipid dye named Exoria. Our analyses qualified Exoria as the only dye which specifically labels EVs within our MSC-EV preparations. Furthermore, we demonstrate Exoria labelling does not interfere with the immunomodulatory properties of the MSC-EV preparations as tested in a multi-donor mixed lymphocyte reaction assay. Within this assay, labelled EVs were differentially taken-up by different immune cell types. Overall, our results qualify Exoria as an appropriate dye for the labelling of EVs derived from our MSC-EV preparations, this study also demonstrates the need for the development of next generation EV characterization tools which are able to localize and confirm specificity of EV labelling.",

    "abstract": "Geometric models allow us to quantify topography of the Waddington landscape and gain quantitative insights of gene interaction in cell fate differentiation. Often mutant phenotypes show partial penetrance and there is a dearth of quantitative models that can exploit this data and make predictions about new allelic combinations with no additional parameters. C. elegans with its invariant cell lineages has been a key model system for discovering the genes controlling development. Here we focus on the differentiation of the endoderm founder cell named E from its mother, the EMS cell. Mutants that convert E to its sister MS fate have figured prominently in deciphering the Wnt pathway in worm. We construct a bi-valued Waddington landscape model that predicts the effect on POP-1/TCF and SYS-1/beta-catenin levels based on the penetrance of mutant alleles and RNAi, and relates the levels to fate choice decisions. A subset of the available data is used to fit the model and remaining data is then correctly predicted. Simple kinetic arguments show that contrary to current belief the ratio of these two proteins alone is not indicative of fate outcomes. Furthermore, double mutants within a background reduction of POP-1 levels are predicted with no adjustable parameters and their relative penetrance can differ from the same mutants with the wild-type POP-1 level, which calls for further experimental investigations. Our model refines the content of existing gene networks and invites extensions to other manifestations of the Wnt pathway in worm.",

    "abstract": "Strain P482 was isolated from a tomato rhizosphere and classified as Pseudomonas donghuensis. The P. donghuensis species was first established in 2015 and currently comprises only four strains: P482, HYST, SVBP6, and 22G5. P. donghuensis strains antagonize plant pathogens, including bacteria, fungi and oomycetes, and therefore are of high interest regarding their biological control potential to combat plant diseases. The antimicrobial activity of P. donghuensis P482 is based on the production of iron scavenging compound 7-hydroxytropolone, antifungal volatile organic compounds, and yet unidentified secondary metabolite(s). Here, we report a complete genome resource for P. donghuensis strain P482. The genome consists of a single chromosome (5 656 185 bp) with 5258 ORFs (5158 protein-coding genes, 74 tRNAs, 22 rRNAs, 3 ncRNAs and 1 tmRNA) and no plasmid. We believe that the information of the first high-quality, complete genome of P. donghuensis will provide resources for analyses targeting the biological control potential of this species and understanding the traits essential for plant-microbe interaction.",

    "abstract": "The hexameric, barrel-forming, AAA+ protease Lon is critical for maintaining mitochondrial matrix protein homeostasis. Efficient substrate processing by Lon requires the coordinated action of six protomers. Despite Lons importance for human health, the molecular bases for Lons substrate recognition and processing remain unclear. Here, we use a combination of biochemistry and electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to unveil the structural and functional basis for full-length human mitochondrial Lons degradation of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). We show how opposing protomers in the Lon hexamer barrel interact through their N-terminal domains to give what resembles three feet above the barrel and help to form a triangular pore located just above the entry pore to the barrel. The interactions between opposing protomers constitute a primary allosteric regulation of Lon activity. A secondary allosteric regulation consists of an inter-subunit signaling element in the ATPase domains. By considering the ATP or ADP load in each protomer, we show how this dual allosteric mechanism in Lon achieves coordinated ATP hydrolysis and substrate processing. This mechanism enforces sequential anti-clockwise ATP hydrolysis resulting in a coordinated hand-over-hand translocation of the substrate towards the protease active sites.",

This variant has 13 amino acid changes, three in its spike protein, which are currently of particular concern: E484Q, L452R and P681R. Here we report a major effect of the mutations characterizing this lineage, represented by a marked alteration of the surface electrostatic potential (EP) of the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Enhanced RBD-EP is particularly noticeable in the B.1.617.2 sublineage, which shows multiple replacements of neutral or negatively-charged amino acids with positively-charged amino acids. We here hypothesize that this EP change can favor the interaction between the B.1.617+RBD and the negatively-charged ACE2 thus conferring a potential increase in the virus transmission.",

We present a quantitative high-resolution imaging assay of cancer cell morphology in zebrafish xenografts to probe functional adaptation to variable cell extrinsic cues and molecular interventions. We focus on Ewing Sarcoma, a pediatric cancer driven by a single oncogenic fusion protein EWSR1-FLI1, and with little to no additional somatic mutations, making it a prototypical form of cancer whose adaptation to microenvironments is likely driven by acute, non-genomic mechanisms. Using computer vision analysis of 3D cell shapes, we find systematic shifts in the distribution of cell morphotypes between distinct sites in the fish embryo. We also find site-specific morphological responses to differential expression of EWSR1-FLI1. Combining these data we propose a model where Ewing Sarcoma cancer cell plasticity is sensitive both to expression fluctuation of EWSR1-FLI1 and signals from the surrounding tissue microenvironment, with either or both factors possibly contributing to the oncogenic potential of these cells.",

    "abstract": "Development involves tightly paced, reproducible sequences of events, yet it must adjust to conditions external to it, such as resource availability and organismal damage. A major mediator of damage-induced immune responses in vertebrates and insects is JAK/STAT signaling. At the same time, JAK/STAT activation by the Drosophila Upd cytokines is pleiotropically involved in normal development of multiple organs. Whether inflammatory and developmental roles of JAK/STAT intersect is unknown. Here, we show that JAK/STAT is active during development of the prothoracic gland (PG), the organ that controls metamorphosis onset through ecdysone production. Reducing JAK/STAT signaling decreased PG size and slightly advanced metamorphosis. Conversely, JAK/STAT hyperactivation, achieved through overexpression of pathway components or SUMOylation loss, caused PG hypertrophy and metamorphosis delay. Interestingly, tissue damage and tumors, known to secrete Upd cytokines, also activated JAK/STAT in the PG and delayed metamorphosis. Finally, we show that expression of transcription factor Apontic, a JAK/STAT target in the PG, recapitulates PG hypertrophy and metamorphosis delay. JAK/STAT damage signaling, therefore, regulates metamorphosis onset at least in part by coopting its developmental role in the PG.\n\nSummary statementDamage signaling from tumors mediated by JAK/STAT-activating Upd cytokines delays the Drosophila larva-pupa transition through cooption of a JAK/STAT developmental role in the prothoracic gland.",

    "abstract": "CDK4/6 inhibitors hold promise for brain tumor treatment, but efficacy has been limited by recurrence in both preclinical models and clinical trials. To address recurrence, we tested a nanoparticle formulation of the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (POx-palbo) in mice genetically-engineered to develop SHH-driven medulloblastoma. We then analyzed medulloblastomas in mice receiving palbociclib treatment, and compared the efficacy of combining palbociclib with specific inhibitors suggested by our analysis. POx-Palbo showed reduced toxicity compared to conventional palbociclib, was tolerable in parenteral administration, improved CNS pharmacokinetics, and extended survival of mice with medulloblastoma. Recurrence, however, remained problematic as fractions of tumor cells proliferated during therapy. ScRNA-seq identified a gene expression pattern unique to proliferating medulloblastoma cells in POx-Palbo-treated mice, marked by up-regulation of the glutamate transporter Slc1a2 and down-regulation of diverse ribosomal genes. Reduced mTORC1 signaling, suggested by ribosomal suppression in POx-Palbo-treated tumors was confirmed by decreased 4EBP1 phosphorylation (p4EBP1). Further reducing mTORC1 activity by combining POx-Palbo with the mTORC1 inhibitor sapanisertib produced mutually enhancing effects, with increased suppression of both pRB and p4EBP1, and prolonged mouse survival compared to either agent alone. In contrast, targeting cell cycle progression by combining POx-Palbo with the SHH-pathway inhibitor vismodegib, or with the replication-targeting agents gemcitabine or etoposide, failed to enhance efficacy. Our data show the potential of nanoparticle formulation and scRNA-seq analysis of resistance to improve brain tumor treatment, and identify POx-palbo plus sapanisertib as effective combinatorial therapy for SHH medulloblastoma. This combination may be appropriate for testing in patients with recurrence, who need new options.",

    "abstract": "Genetic alterations in cancer cells trigger oncogenic transformation, a process largely mediated by the dysregulation of kinase and transcription factor (TF) activities. While the mutational profiles of thousands of tumours has been extensively characterized, the measurements of protein activities has been technically limited until recently. We compiled public data of matched genomics and (phospho)proteomics measurements for 1,110 tumours and 77 cell lines that we used to estimate activity changes in 218 kinases and 292 TFs. Kinase activities are, on average, not strongly determined by protein abundance but rather by their phosphorylation state while the reverse is more common for TFs. Co-regulation of kinase and TF activities reflects previously known regulatory relationships and allows us to dissect genetic drivers of signalling changes in cancer. Loss-of-function mutation is not often associated with dysregulation of downstream targets, suggesting frequent compensatory mechanisms. Finally, we identified the activities most differentially regulated in cancer subtypes and showed how these can be linked to differences in patient survival. Our results provide broad insights into dysregulation of protein activities in cancer and their contribution to disease severity.",

Most of previous RNA editing studies have focused on organelles, while RNA editing of nuclear transcripts is largely unknown. Here, we describe the first example of nuclear transcript RNA editing in plant, the BOSS RNA editing regulates tomato flowering. The SNP (SNP1) located in the 5UTR of BOSS gene (the Balancer of SP and SFT) is associated with tomato early flowering, and two transcripts of BOSS produced by SNP1 associated RNA editing show functional differentiation, where BOSS-{beta} transcript promotes flowering while BOSS- does not. Furthermore, these two transcripts of BOSS are shown to regulate SP (anti-florigen) pathway at transcription level in the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Our findings reveal a new layer of complexity in the control of plant stem cell proliferation and provide the evidence of RNA-editing of a single gene for flowering, suggesting that molecular breeding programs to increase the RNA-editing efficiency may improve the productivity of tomatoes and other agricultural organisms.",

    "abstract": "Heritable microorganisms play critical roles in life cycles of many macro-organisms but their prevalence and functional roles are unknown for most plants. Bioactive ergot alkaloids produced by heritable Periglandula fungi occur in some morning glories (Convolvulaceae), similar to ergot alkaloids in grasses infected with related fungi. Ergot alkaloids have been of longstanding interest given their toxic effects, psychoactive properties, and medical applications. Here we show that ergot alkaloids are concentrated in four morning glory clades exhibiting differences in alkaloid profiles and are more prevalent in species with larger seeds than those with smaller seeds. Further, we found a phylogenetically-independent, positive correlation between seed mass and alkaloid concentrations in symbiotic species. Our findings suggest that heritable symbiosis has diversified among particular clades by vertical transmission through seeds combined with host speciation, and that ergot alkaloids are particularly beneficial to species with larger seeds. Our results are consistent with the defensive symbiosis hypothesis where bioactive ergot alkaloids from Periglandula symbionts protect seeds and seedlings from natural enemies, and provide a framework for exploring microbial chemistry in other plant-microbe interactions.",

    "abstract": "The role of CB1/CB2 co-expression in cell signaling remains elusive. We established a simplified mammalian cell model system in which expression of CB1 or CB2 can be easily monitored under a confocal microscope. For this, we applied amber codon suppression in live cells to incorporate a single trans-cyclooctene (TCO) bearing amino acid in one of the extracellular loops of CB1 or CB2, followed by fluorescent labeling via click chemistry. We employed genetically encoded biosensors to measure the roles of CB1 and/or CB2 in regulating intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and cAMP ([cAMP]i) levels. We show that the agonist-mediated activation of tagged-CB1 or -CB2 can transiently elevate [Ca2+]i levels. However, when the two receptors were co-expressed in the same cell, CB2 no longer signaled through calcium although CB1-mediated transient elevation of [Ca2+]i levels was unaffected. Because of the existence of crosstalk between calcium and cAMP signaling, we measured the effects of CB1 and/or CB2 in regulating adenylate cyclase activity. We found that the expression of CB1 increased forskolin-induced [cAMP]i levels compared to non-transfected cells. Conversely, CB2 expression decreased stimulated [cAMP]i levels under the same conditions. Finally, co-expressed CB1 and CB2 receptors showed additive yet opposing effects on stimulated [cAMP]i levels. These observations suggest that co-expressed CB1/CB2 act locally as a pair in regulating cell excitability by modulating stimulated [cAMP]i levels.",

    "abstract": "Many neuromuscular disorders are caused by dominant missense mutations that lead to dominant-negative or gain-of-function pathology. This category of disease is challenging to address via drug treatment or gene augmentation therapy because these strategies may not eliminate the effects of the mutant protein or RNA. Thus, effective treatments are severely lacking for these dominant diseases, which often cause severe disability or death. The targeted inactivation of dominant disease alleles by gene editing is a promising approach with the potential to completely remove the cause of pathology with a single treatment. Here, we demonstrate that allele-specific CRISPR gene editing in a human model of axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease rescues pathology caused by a dominant missense mutation in the neurofilament light chain gene (NEFL, CMT type 2E). We utilized a rapid and efficient method for generating spinal motor neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a patient with CMT2E. Diseased motor neurons recapitulated known pathologic phenotypes at early time points of differentiation, including aberrant accumulation of neurofilament light chain protein in neuronal cell bodies. We selectively inactivated the disease NEFL allele in patient iPSCs using Cas9 enzymes to introduce a frameshift at the pathogenic N98S mutation. Motor neurons carrying this allele-specific frameshift demonstrated an amelioration of the disease phenotype comparable to that seen in an isogenic control with precise correction of the mutation. Our results validate allele-specific gene editing as a therapeutic approach for CMT2E and as a promising strategy to silence dominant mutations in any gene for which heterozygous loss-of-function is well tolerated. This highlights the potential for gene editing as a therapy for currently untreatable dominant neurologic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Northern (Glaucomys sabrinus) and southern (Glaucomys volans) flying squirrels are widespread species distributed across much of North America. Northern flying squirrels are common inhabitants of the boreal forest, also occurring in coniferous forest remnants farther south, whereas the southern flying squirrel range is centered in eastern temperate woodlands. These two flying squirrel species exhibit a hybrid zone across a latitudinal gradient in an area of recent secondary contact. Glaucomys hybrid offspring are viable and can successfully backcross with either parental species, however, the fitness implications of such events are currently unknown. Some populations of G. sabrinus are endangered, and thus, interspecific hybridization is a key conservation concern in flying squirrels. We sequenced and assembled a de novo long-read genome from a G. volans individual sampled in southern Ontario, Canada, while four short-read genomes (2 G. sabrinus and 2 G. volans, all from Ontario) were re-sequenced on Illumina platforms. The final genome assembly consisted of approximately 2.40Gb with a scaffold N50 of 455.26Kb. Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs reconstructed 3,742 (91.2%) complete mammalian genes and genome annotation using RNA-seq identified the locations of 19,124 protein-coding genes. The four short-read individuals were aligned to our reference genome to investigate the demographic history of the two species. A Principal Component Analysis clearly separated re-sequenced individuals, while inferring population size history using the Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent model noted an approximate species split one million years ago, and a single, possibly recently introgressed individual.",

    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) causes damaging inflammation in multiple organs via the accumulation of immune complexes. These complexes activate plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) via TLR7 and TLR9, contributing to disease pathogenesis by driving secretion of inflammatory type I IFNs. Antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine (CQ), are TLR antagonists used to alleviate inflammation in SLE. However, they require ~3 months of continuous use before achieving therapeutic efficacy and can accumulate in the retinal pigment epithelium with chronic use resulting in retinopathy. We hypothesized that poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(propylene sulfide) (PEG-b-PPS) filamentous nanocarriers, filomicelles (FMs) could improve drug activity and reduce toxicity by directly delivering CQ to pDCs via passive, morphology-based targeting. Healthy human PBMCs were treated with soluble CQ or CQ-loaded FMs, stimulated with TLR agonists or SLE patient sera, and type I IFN secretion was quantified via multi-subtype IFN- ELISA and MX1 gene expression using real-time RT-qPCR. Our results showed that 50 {micro}g CQ/mg FM decreased MX1 expression and IFN- production after TLR activation with either synthetic nucleic acid agonists or immune complex rich sera from SLE patients. Cellular uptake and biodistribution studies showed that FMs preferentially accumulate in human pDCs in vitro and in tissues frequently damaged in SLE patients (i.e., liver and kidneys) while sparing the eye in vivo. These results showed that nanocarrier morphology enables drug delivery, and CQ-FMs may be equally effective and more targeted than soluble CQ at inhibiting SLE-relevant pathways.",

    "abstract": "Cas12a is an RNA-guided endonuclease that is emerging as a powerful genome-editing tool. Here we combined optical tweezers with fluorescence to monitor Cas12a binding onto {lambda}-DNA, providing insight into its DNA binding and cleavage mechanisms. At low forces Cas12a binds DNA specifically with two off-target sites, while at higher forces numerous binding events appear driven by the mechanical distortion of the DNA and partial matches to the crRNA. Despite the multiple binding events, cleavage is only observed on the target site at low forces, when the DNA is flexible. Activity assays show that the preferential off-target sites are not cleaved, and the {lambda}-DNA is severed at the target site. This precision is also observed in Cas12a variants where the specific dsDNA and the unspecific ssDNA cleavage are dissociated or nick the target DNA. We propose that Cas12a and its variants are precise endonucleases that efficiently scan the DNA for its target but only cleave the selected site in the {lambda}-DNA.",

Here, we present an artificial differentiation system in budding yeast capable of generating stable microbial consortia with custom functionalities from a single strain at user-defined composition in space and in time based on optogenetically-driven genetic rewiring. Owing to fast, reproducible, and light-tunable dynamics, our system enables dynamic control of consortia composition in continuous cultures for extended periods.

    "abstract": "1 AbstractWe introduce a framework for end-to-end integrative modeling of 3D single-cell multi-channel fluorescent image data of diverse subcellular structures. We employ stacked conditional {beta}-variational autoencoders to first learn a latent representation of cell morphology, and then learn a latent representation of subcellular structure localization which is conditioned on the learned cell morphology. Our model is flexible and can be trained on images of arbitrary subcellular structures and at varying degrees of sparsity and reconstruction fidelity. We train our full model on 3D cell image data and explore design trade-offs in the 2D setting. Once trained, our model can be used to impute structures in cells where they were not imaged and to quantify the variation in the location of all subcellular structures by generating plausible instantiations of each structure in arbitrary cell geometries. We apply our trained model to a small drug perturbation screen to demonstrate its applicability to new data. We show how the latent representations of drugged cells differ from unperturbed cells as expected by on-target effects of the drugs.\n\n2 Author summaryIts impossible to acquire all the information we want about every cell were interested in in a single experiment. Even just limiting ourselves to imaging, we can only image a small set of subcellular structures in each cell. If we are interested in integrating those images into a holistic picture of cellular organization directly from data, there are a number of approaches one might take. Here, we leverage the fact that of the three channels we image in each cell, two stay the same across the data set; these two channels assess the cells shape and nuclear morphology. Given these two reference channels, we learn a model of cell and nuclear morphology, and then use this as a reference frame in which to learn a representation of the localization of each subcellular structure as measured by the third channel. We use {beta}-variational autoencoders to learn representations of both the reference channels and representations of each subcellular structure (conditioned on the reference channels of the cell in which it was imaged). Since these models are both probabilistic and generative, we can use them to understand the variation in the data from which they were trained, to generate instantiations of new cell morphologies, and to generate imputations of structures in real cell images to create an integrated model of subcellular organization.",

    "abstract": "Caveolae have been linked to many biological functions, but their precise roles are unclear. Using quantitative whole cell proteomics of genome-edited cells, we show that the oxidative stress response is the major pathway dysregulated in cells lacking the key caveola structural protein, CAVIN1. CAVIN1 deletion compromised sensitivity to oxidative stress in cultured cells and in animals. Wound-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis were suppressed in Cavin1-null zebrafish, negatively affecting regeneration. Oxidative stress triggered lipid peroxidation and induced caveolar disassembly. The resulting release of CAVIN1 from caveolae allowed direct interaction between CAVIN1 and NRF2, a key regulator of the antioxidant response, facilitating NRF2 degradation. CAVIN1-null cells with impaired negative regulation of NRF2 showed resistance to lipid peroxidation-induced ferroptosis. Thus, caveolae, via lipid peroxidation and CAVIN1 release, maintain cellular susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced cell death demonstrating a crucial role for this enigmatic organelle in cellular homeostasis and wound response.",

We studied the impact of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1A (HIF1A) pathway on postnatal {beta}-cell function. Rat pups were treated daily between postnatal day (P)7 to P10 with adaptaquin (AQ), an inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylases, which stabilizes HIF1A. AQ-treated pups were hypoglycemic and had higher plasma insulin concentrations. Their islets had a decreased glucose threshold for insulin secretion, indicative of a delay in {beta}-cell postnatal functional maturation. Histology analyses revealed that AQ-treated pups had increased pancreatic insulin-positive area but no changes in the number of islets or number of {beta}-cells per islet, suggesting larger average {beta}-cell size. AQ-treated rat pups had decreased expression of cell cycle genes and decreased numbers of proliferating {beta}-cells. In conclusion, pharmacologic activation of the HIF1A pathway in the early postnatal period leads to hyperinsulinism, due to the persistence of a low glucose threshold for insulin secretion, and to decreased early postnatal {beta}-cell proliferation, suggesting it can impact adult {beta}-cell mass and diabetes risk.",

    "abstract": "Rationalizing the identification of hidden similarities across the repertoire of druggable protein cavities remains a major hurdle to a true proteome-wide structure-based discovery of novel drug candidates. We recently described a new computational approach (ProCare), inspired by numerical image processing, to identify local similarities in fragment-based subpockets. During the validation of the method, we unexpectedly identified a possible similarity in the binding pockets of two unrelated targets, human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT). Microscale thermophoresis experiments confirmed the ProCare prediction as two of the three tested and FDA-approved HIV-1 RT inhibitors indeed bind to soluble human TNF- trimer. Interestingly, the herein disclosed similarity could be revealed neither by state-of-the-art binding sites comparison methods nor by ligand-based pairwise similarity searches, suggesting that the point cloud registration approach implemented in ProCare, is uniquely suited to identify local and unobvious similarities among totally unrelated targets.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYComputational comparison of binding sites in proteins can provide insights on potential unrelated proteins that may bind to similar ligands. However, accurate prediction of binding site similarity requires powerful methods, ideally able to detect even local similarities. We herewith applied a recently developed computer vision method to identify an unexpected binding site similarity between two totally unrelated proteins that was confirmed experimentally by in vitro biophysical binding assays. Considering more precisely local similarities can therefore efficiently guide drug discovery, notably to repurpose existing drug candidates.",

    "abstract": "In-silico methods for the prediction of epitopes can support and improve workflows for vaccine design, antibody production, and disease therapy. So far, the scope of B cell and T cell epitope prediction has been directed exclusively towards peptidic antigens. Nevertheless, various non-peptidic molecular classes can be recognized by immune cells. These compounds have not been systematically studied yet, and prediction approaches are lacking. The ability to predict the epitope activity of non-peptidic compounds could have vast implications; for example, for immunogenic risk assessment of the vast number of drugs and other xenobiotics. Here we present the first general attempt to predict the epitope activity of non-peptidic compounds using the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) as a source for positive samples. The molecules stored in the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database were chosen as background samples. The molecules were clustered into eight homogeneous molecular groups, and classifiers were built for each cluster with the aim of separating the epitopes from the background. Different molecular feature encoding schemes and machine learning models were compared against each other. For those models where a high performance could be achieved based on simple decision rules, the molecular features were then further investigated. Additionally, the findings were used to build a web server that allows for the immunogenic investigation of non-peptidic molecules (http://tools-staging.iedb.org/np_epitope_predictor). The prediction quality was tested with samples from independent evaluation datasets, and the implemented method received noteworthy Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) values, ranging from 0.69-0.96 depending on the molecule cluster.",

    "abstract": "Adherent cells seeded on substrates spread and evolve their morphology while simultaneously displaying motility. Phenomena such as contact guidance viz. the alignment of cells on patterned substrates, are strongly linked to the coupling of morphological evolution with motility. Here we employ a recently developed statistical thermodynamics framework for modelling the non-thermal fluctuating response of the cells to probe this coupling. This thermodynamic framework is first extended to predict temporal responses via a Langevin style model. The Langevin model is then shown to not only predict the different experimentally observed temporal scales for morphological observables such as cell area and elongation but also the interplay of morphology with motility that ultimately leads to contact guidance.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe evolution of cellular morphology and organization plays a crucial role in the micro-architecture of tissues and dictates their biological and mechanical functioning. Despite the importance of cellular organization in all facets of tissue biology, the fundamental question of how a cell organizes itself in an anisotropic environment is still poorly understood. We demonstrate, using a Langevin style model, that non-thermal fluctuations fuelled by nutrient exchanges between the cell and its environment are critical in allowing cells to explore their surroundings. The biochemical changes, associated with non-thermal fluctuations, drive cell motility and morphological changes and the interplay between these two emerging dynamics ultimately leads to contact guidance, a critical component for tissue morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Transmembranal G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) transduce extracellular chemical signals to the cell, via conformational change from a resting (inactive) to an active (canonically bound to a G-protein) conformation. Receptor activation is normally modulated by extracellular ligand binding, but mutations in the receptor can also shift this equilibrium by stabilizing different conformational states. In this work, we built structure-energetic relationships of receptor activation based on original thermodynamic cycles that represent the conformational equilibrium of the prototypical A2A adenosine receptor (AR). These cycles were solved with efficient free energy perturbation (FEP) protocols, allowing to distinguish the pharmacological profile of different series of A2AAR agonists with different efficacies. The modulatory effects of point mutations on the basal activity of the receptor or on ligand efficacies could also be detected. This methodology can guide GPCR ligand design with tailored pharmacological properties, or allow the identification of mutations that modulate receptor activation with potential clinical implications.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe design of new ligands as chemical modulators of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has benefited considerably during the last years of advances in both the structural and computational biology disciplines. Within the last, area, the use of free energy calculation methods has arisen as a computational tool to predict ligand affinities to explain structure-affinity relationships and guide lead optimization campaigns. However, our comprehension of the structural determinants of ligands with different pharmacological profile is scarce, and knowledge of the chemical modifications associated with an agonistic or antagonistic profile would be extremely valuable. We herein report an original implementation of the thermodynamic cycles associated with free energy perturbation (FEP) simulations, to mimic the conformational equilibrium between active and inactive GPCRs, and establish a framework to describe pharmacological profiles as a function of the ligands selectivity for a given receptor conformation. The advantage of this method resides into its simplicity of use, and the only consideration of active and inactive conformations of the receptor, with no simulation of the transitions between them. This model can accurately predict the pharmacological profile of series of full and partial agonists as opposed to antagonists of the A2A adenosine receptor, and moreover, how certain mutations associated with modulation of basal activity can influence this pharmacological profiles, which enables our understanding of such clinically relevant mutations.",

    "abstract": "Chemotactic bacteria form emergent spatial patterns of variable cell density within cultures that are initially spatially uniform. These patterns are the result of chemical gradients that are created from the directed movement and metabolic activity of billions of cells. A recent study on pattern formation in wild bacterial isolates has revealed unique collective behaviors of the bacteria Enterobacter cloacae. As in other bacteria species, Enterobacter cloacae form macroscopic aggregates. Once formed, these bacterial clusters can migrate several millimeters, sometimes resulting in the merging of two or more clusters. To better understand these phenomena, we examine the formation and dynamics of thousands of bacterial clusters that form within a 22 cm square culture dish filled with soft agar over two days. At the macroscale, the aggregates display spatial order at short length scales, and the migration of cell clusters is superdiffusive, with a merging acceleration that is correlated with aggregate size. At the microscale, aggregates are composed of immotile cells surrounded by low density regions of motile cells. The collective movement of the aggregates is the result of an asymmetric flux of bacteria at the boundary. An agent based model is developed to examine how these phenomena are the result of both chemotactic movement and a change in motility at high cell density. These results identify and characterize a new mechanism for collective bacterial motility driven by a transient, density-dependent change in motility.\n\nAuthor summaryBacteria growing and swimming in soft agar often aggregate to form elaborate spatial patterns. Here we examine the patterns formed by the bacteria Enterobacter cloacae. An unusual behavior of this bacteria is the movement of cell clusters, millions of bacteria forming a tiny spot and moving together in the same direction. These spots sometimes run into each other and combine. By looking at the cells within these spots under a microscope, we find that cells within each spot stop swimming. The process of switching back and forth between swimming and not swimming causes the movement and fusion of the spots. A numerical simulation shows that the migration and merging of these spots can be expected if the cells swim towards regions of space with high concentrations of attractant molecules and stop swimming in locations crowded with many cells. This work identifies a novel process through which populations of bacteria cooperate and control the movement of large groups of cells.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes doubles the risk of developing heart failure (HF). As the prevalence of diabetes grows, so will HF unless the mechanisms connecting these diseases can be identified. Methylglyoxal (MG) is a glycolysis by-product that forms irreversible modifications on lysine and arginine, called glycation. We previously found that myofilament MG glycation causes sarcomere contractile dysfunction and is increased in patients with diabetes and HF. The aim of this study was to discover the molecular mechanisms by which MG glycation of myofilament proteins cause sarcomere dysfunction and to identify therapeutic avenues to compensate. In humans with type 2 diabetes without HF, we found increased glycation of sarcomeric actin compared to non-diabetics and it correlated with decreased calcium sensitivity. Depressed calcium sensitivity is pathogenic for HF, therefore myofilament glycation represents a promising therapeutic target to inhibit the development of HF in diabetics. To identify possible therapeutic targets, we further defined the molecular actions of myofilament glycation. Skinned myocytes exposed to 100 M MG exhibited decreased calcium sensitivity, maximal calcium-activated force, and crossbridge kinetics. Replicating MGs functional affects using a computer simulation of sarcomere function predicted simultaneous decreases in tropomyosins blocked-to-closed rate transition and crossbridge duty cycle were consistent with all experimental findings. Stopped-flow experiments and ATPase activity confirmed MG decreased the blocked-to-closed transition rate. Currently, no therapeutics target tropomyosin, so as proof-of-principal, we used a n-terminal peptide of myosin-binding protein C, previously shown to alter tropomyosins position on actin. C0C2 completely rescued MG-induced calcium desensitization, suggesting a possible treatment for diabetic HF.",

    "abstract": "PurposeSuccinate dehydrogenase-deficient and fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinomas (SDHRCC and FHRCC) are rare kidney cancers driven by loss of metabolically proximal enzymes. We sought to define and compare the genomic and metabolomic hallmarks of these entities.\n\nExperimental DesignWe analyzed SDHRCC and FHRCC tumors with either immunohistochemical evidence of loss of protein expression or genomically-confirmed biallelic inactivation of SDHA/B/C/D/AF2 or FH. Somatic alterations were identified using clinical pipelines, and allele-specific copy number changes were identified using FACETS. Mass-spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling was performed on available SDHRCC and FHRCC tumors.\n\nResultsForty two patients were analyzed (25 FHRCC, 17 SDHRCC). In the germline analysis, 16/17 SDHRCC harbored a germline alteration in SDHB, whereas only 17/22 FHRCC had pathogenic germline FH variants. SDHRCC had a lower mutation burden (p = 0.02) and copy number alteration burden (p = 0.0002) than FHRCC. All SDHRCC presented with deletion of chromosome 1p (overlapping SDHB), whereas FHRCC demonstrated high but not ubiquitous loss of 1q (FH locus). Both SDHRCC and FHRCC demonstrated significant, idiopathic accumulation of the metabolite guanine. FHRCC tumors had elevated levels of urea cycle metabolites (argininosuccinate, citrulline, and fumarate), whereas SDHRCC had elevation of numerous acylcarnitines. These characteristic metabolic changes enabled the identification of a previously unrecognized SDH-deficient RCC.\n\nConclusionDespite sharing similar genetic etiology, SDHRCC and FHRCC represent distinct molecular entities with unique genetic and metabolic abnormalities.\n\nTranslational RelevanceMutations to the TCA cycle enzymes Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH) and Fumarate Hydratase (FH) predispose individuals to unique subtypes of renal cell carcinoma (SDHRCC and FHRCC, respectively). Defining the genetic and metabolic hallmarks of these diseases is critical for advancing new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for these rare but biologically intriguing entities. Despite a superficially similar genetic etiology, SDHRCC and FHRCC demonstrated significantly fewer secondary mutations to other cancer-associated genes and copy number aberrations than FHRCC, and was distinguished by universal loss-of-heterozygosity of chromosome 1p. Metabolomic analysis identified pathways disrupted in both SDHRCC and FHRCC, including the massive accumulation of free guanine, as well as pathways uniquely disrupted in each of the two entities. These metabolomic findings enabled the identification of a previously unidentified case of unclassified RCC with SDH deficiency, suggesting that metabolomic profiling may aid in phenotypic classification of tumors and uncover novel therapeutic targets.",
