    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by alpha-synuclein (Syn) aggregation and associated with abnormalities in lipid metabolism. The accumulation of lipids in cytoplasmic organelles called lipid droplets (LDs) was observed in cellular models of PD. To investigate the pathophysiological consequences of interactions between Syn and proteins that regulate the homeostasis of LDs, we used a transgenic Drosophila model of PD, in which human Syn is specifically expressed in photoreceptor neurons. We first found that overexpression of the LD-coating proteins perilipin 1 or 2 (dPlin1/2), which limit the access of lipases to LDs, markedly increased triacylglyclerol (TG) loaded LDs in neurons. However, dPlin-induced-LDs in neurons are independent of lipid anabolic (diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1/Midway, fatty acid transport protein/dFatp) and catabolic (lipase Brummer) enzymes, indicating that non-canonical mechanisms regulate neuronal LD homeostasis. Interestingly, the accumulation of LDs induced by several distinct LD proteins (dPlin1, dPlin2, CG7900 or KlarsichtLD-BD) was synergistically amplified by the co-expression of Syn, which was found at the surface of LDs both in photoreceptors neurons of Drosophila and in human neuroblastoma cells. Finally, the accumulation of LDs increased the resistance of Syn to proteolytic digestion, a phenomenon associated with Syn aggregation in human neurons. We thus propose that Syn cooperates with LD proteins to inhibit lipolysis and that binding of Syn to LDs contributes to the pathogenic misfolding and aggregation of Syn in neurons.",

    "abstract": "Metacognition is the ability to reflect on, and evaluate, our cognition and behaviour. Distortions in metacognition are common in mental health disorders, though the neural underpinnings of such dysfunction are unknown. One reason for this is that models of key components of metacognition, such as decision confidence, are generally specified at an algorithmic or process level. While such models can be used to relate brain function to psychopathology, they are difficult to map to a neurobiological mechanism. Here, we develop a biologically-plausible model of decision uncertainty in an attempt to bridge this gap. We first relate the models uncertainty in perceptual decisions to standard metrics of metacognition, namely mean confidence level (bias) and the accuracy of metacognitive judgments (sensitivity). We show that dissociable shifts in metacognition are associated with isolated disturbances at higher-order levels of a circuit associated with self-monitoring, akin to neuropsychological findings that highlight the detrimental effect of prefrontal brain lesions on metacognitive performance. Notably, we are able to account for empirical confidence judgements by fitting the parameters of our biophysical model to first-order performance data, specifically choice and response times. Lastly, in a reanalysis of existing data we show that self-reported mental health symptoms relate to disturbances in an uncertainty-monitoring component of the network. By bridging a gap between a biologically-plausible model of confidence formation and observed disturbances of metacognition in mental health disorders we provide a first step towards mapping theoretical constructs of metacognition onto dynamical models of decision uncertainty. In doing so, we provide a computational framework for modelling metacognitive performance in settings where access to explicit confidence reports is not possible.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn this work, we use a biologically-plausible model of decision uncertainty to show that shifts in metacognition are associated with disturbances in the interaction between decision-making and higher-order uncertainty-monitoring networks. Specifically, we show that stronger uncertainty modulation is associated with decreased metacognitive bias, sensitivity, and efficiency, with no effect on perceptual sensitivity. Our approach not only enables inferences about uncertainty modulation (and, in turn, these facets of metacognition) from fits to first-order performance data alone - but also provides a first step towards relating dynamical models of decision-making to metacognition. We also relate our models uncertainty modulation to psychopathology, and show that it can offer an implicit, low-dimensional marker of metacognitive (dys)function - opening the door to richer analysis of the interaction between metacognitive performance and psychopathology from first-order performance data.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of scRNA-seq SNVs to distinguish tumor from normal cells, characterize intra-tumoral heterogeneity, and define mutation-associated expression signatures. In addition to cancer studies, SNVs from single cells have been useful in studies of transcriptional burst kinetics, allelic expression, chromosome X inactivation, ploidy estimations, and haplotype inference. To aid these types of studies, we have developed a tool, SCReadCounts, for cell-level tabulation of the sequencing read counts bearing SNV reference and variant alleles from barcoded scRNA-seq alignments. Provided genomic loci and expected alleles, SCReadCounts generates cell-SNV matrices with the absolute variant- and reference-harboring read counts, as well as cell-SNV matrices of expressed Variant Allele Fraction (VAFRNA) suitable for a variety of downstream applications. We demonstrate three different SCReadCounts applications on 59,884 cells from seven neuroblastoma samples: (1) estimation of cell-level expression of known somatic mutations and RNA-editing sites, (2) estimation of celllevel allele expression of germline heterozygous SNVs, and (3) a discovery mode assessment of the reference and each of the three alternative nucleotides at genomic positions of interest that does not require prior SNV information. For the later, we applied SCReadCounts on the coding regions of KRAS, where it identified known and novel recurrent somatic mutations in a low-to-moderate proportion of cells. The SCReadCounts read counts module is benchmarked against the analogous modules of GATK and Samtools. SCReadCounts is freely available (https://github.com/HorvathLab/NGS) as 64-bit self-contained binary distributions for Linux and MacOS, in addition to Python source.",

    "abstract": "Chemosensitivity assays are commonly used for preclinical drug discovery and clinical trial optimization. However, data from independent assays are often discordant, largely attributed to uncharacterized variation in the experimental materials and protocols. We report here the launching of MICHA (Minimal Information for Chemosensitivity Assays), accessed via https://micha-protocol.org. Distinguished from existing efforts that are often lacking support from data integration tools, MICHA can automatically extract publicly available information to facilitate the assay annotation including: 1) compounds, 2) samples, 3) reagents, and 4) data processing methods. For example, MICHA provides an integrative web server and database to obtain compound annotation including chemical structures, targets, and disease indications. In addition, the annotation of cell line samples, assay protocols and literature references can be greatly eased by retrieving manually curated catalogues. Once the annotation is complete, MICHA can export a report that conforms to the FAIR principle (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) of drug screening studies. To consolidate the utility of MICHA, we provide FAIRified protocols from five major cancer drug screening studies, as well as six recently conducted COVID-19 studies. With the MICHA webserver and database, we envisage a wider adoption of a community-driven effort to improve the open access of drug sensitivity assays.",

    "abstract": "PurposeReducing scan times is important for wider adoption of high-resolution volumetric MRI in research and clinical practice. Emerging fast imaging and deep learning techniques provide promising strategies to accelerate volumetric MRI without compromising image quality. In this study, we aim to leverage an advanced fast imaging technique, wave-controlled aliasing in parallel imaging (Wave-CAIPI), and a novel denoising generative adversarial network (GAN) to achieve accelerated high-fidelity, high-signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) volumetric MRI.\n\nMethods3D T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image data were acquired on 33 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients using a prototype Wave-CAIPI sequence (acceleration factor R=3x2, 2.75 minutes) and a standard T2-SPACE FLAIR sequence (R=2, 7.25 minutes). A hybrid denoising GAN entitled \"HDnGAN\" composed of a 3D generator (i.e., a modified 3D U-Net entitled MU-Net) and a 2D discriminator was proposed to denoise Wave-CAIPI images with the standard FLAIR images as the target. HDnGAN was trained and validated on data from 25 MS patients by minimizing a combined content loss (i.e., mean squared error (MSE)) and adversarial loss with adjustable weight{lambda} , and evaluated on data from 8 patients unseen during training. The quality of HDnGAN-denoised images was compared to those from other denoising methods including AONLM, BM4D, MU-Net, and 3D GAN in terms of their similarity to standard FLAIR images, quantified using MSE and VGG perceptual loss. The images from different methods were assessed by two neuroradiologists using a five-point score regarding sharpness, SNR, lesion conspicuity, and overall quality. Finally, the performance of these denoising methods was compared at higher noise levels using simulated data with added Rician noise.\n\nResultsHDnGAN effectively denoised noisy Wave-CAIPI images with sharpness and rich textural details, which could be adjusted by controlling{lambda} . Quantitatively, HDnGAN ({lambda}=10-3) achieved low MSE (7.43 x10-4{+/-}0.94x10-4) and the lowest VGG perceptual loss (1.09x10-2{+/-}0.18x10-2). The reader study showed that HDnGAN ({lambda}=10-3) significantly improved the SNR of Wave-CAIPI images (4.19{+/-}0.39 vs. 2.94{+/-}0.24, P<0.001), outperformed AONLM (4.25{+/-}0.56 vs. 3.75{+/-}0.90, P=0.015), BM4D (3.31{+/-}0.46, P<0.001), MU-Net (3.13{+/-}0.99, P<0.001) and 3D GAN ({lambda}=10-3) (3.31{+/-}0.46, P<0.001) regarding image sharpness, and outperformed MU-Net (4.21{+/-}0.67 vs. 3.29{+/-}1.28, P<0.001) and 3D GAN ({lambda}=10-3) (3.5{+/-}0.82, P=0.001) regarding lesion conspicuity. The overall quality score of HDnGAN ({lambda}=10-3) (4.25{+/-}0.43) was significantly higher than those from Wave-CAIPI (3.69{+/-}0.46, P=0.003), BM4D (3.50{+/-}0.71, P=0.001), MU-Net (3.25{+/-}0.75, P<0.001), and 3D GAN ({lambda}=10-3) (3.50{+/-}0.50, P<0.001), with no significant difference compared to standard FLAIR images (4.38{+/-}0.48, P=0.333). The advantages of HDnGAN over other methods were more obvious at higher noise levels.\n\nConclusionHDnGAN provides robust and feasible denoising while preserving rich textural detail in empirical volumetric MRI data and is superior on both quantitative and qualitative evaluation compared to the original Wave-CAIPI images and images denoised using standard methods. HDnGAN concurrently benefits from the improved image synthesis performance of the 3D convolution and the increased number of samples for training the 2D discriminator from a limited number of subjects. Our study supports the use of HDnGAN in combination with modern fast imaging techniques such as Wave-CAIPI to achieve high-fidelity fast volumetric MRI.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSystems biology increasingly relies on deep sequencing with combinatorial index tags to associate biological sequences with their sample, cell, or molecule of origin. Accurate data interpretation depends on the ability to classify sequences based on correct decoding of these combinatorial barcodes. The probability of correct decoding is influenced by both sequence quality and the number and arrangement of barcodes. The rising complexity of experimental designs calls for a probability model that accounts for both sequencing errors and random noise, generalizes to multiple combinatorial tags, and can handle any barcoding scheme. The needs for reproducibility and community benchmark standards demand a peer-reviewed tool that preserves decoding quality scores and provides tunable control over classification confidence that balances precision and recall. Moreover, continuous improvements in sequencing throughput require a fast, parallelized and scalable implementation.\n\nResultsWe developed a flexible, robustly engineered software that performs probabilistic decoding and supports arbitrarily complex barcoding designs. Pheniqs computes the full posterior decoding error probability of observed barcodes by consulting basecalling quality scores and prior distributions, and reports sequences and confidence scores in Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) fields. The product of posteriors for multiple independent barcodes provides an overall confidence score for each read. Pheniqs achieves greater accuracy than minimum edit distance or simple maximum likelihood estimation, and it scales linearly with core count to enable the classification of >11 billion reads in 1h15m using <50 megabytes of memory. Pheniqs has been in production use for seven years in our genomics core facility.\n\nConclusionsWe introduce a computationally efficient software that implements both probabilistic and minimum distance decoders and show that decoding barcodes using posterior probabilities is more accurate than available methods. Pheniqs allows fine-tuning of decoding sensitivity using intuitive confidence thresholds and is extensible with alternative decoders and new error models. Any arbitrary arrangement of barcodes is easily configured, enabling computation of combinatorial confidence scores for any barcoding strategy. An optimized multithreaded implementation assures that Pheniqs is faster and scales better with complex barcode sets than existing tools. Support for POSIX streams and multiple sequencing formats enables easy integration with automated analysis pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Shigella is the second leading cause of diarrheal diseases, accounting for >200,000 infections and >50,000 deaths in children under 5 years of age annually worldwide. The incidence of Shigella-induced diarrhea is relatively low during the first year of life and increases substantially, reaching its peak between 11 to 24 months of age. This epidemiological trend hints at an early protective immunity of maternal origin and an increase in disease incidence when maternally acquired immunity wanes. The magnitude, type, antigenic diversity, and antimicrobial activity of maternal antibodies transferred via placenta that can prevent shigellosis during early infancy are not known. To address this knowledge gap, Shigella-specific antibodies directed against the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and virulence factors (IpaB, IpaC, IpaD, IpaH, and VirG), and antibody-mediated serum bactericidal (SBA) and opsonophagocytic killing antibody (OPKA) activity were measured in maternal and cord blood sera from a longitudinal cohort of mother-infant pairs living in rural Malawi. Protein-specific (very high levels) and Shigella LPS IgG were detected in maternal and cord blood sera; efficiency of placental transfer was 100% and 60%, respectively, and had preferential IgG subclass distribution (protein-specific IgG1 > LPS-specific IgG2). In contrast, SBA and OPKA activity in cord blood was substantially lower as compared to maternal serum and varied among Shigella serotypes. LPS was identified as the primary target of SBA and OPKA activity. Maternal sera had remarkably elevated Shigella flexneri 2a LPS IgM, indicative of recent exposure. Our study revealed a broad repertoire of maternally acquired antibodies in infants living in a Shigella-endemic region and highlights the abundance of protein-specific antibodies and their likely contribution to disease prevention during the first months of life. These results contribute new knowledge on maternal infant immunity and target antigens that can inform the development of vaccines or therapeutics that can extend protection after maternally transferred immunity wanes.",

    "abstract": "The invasive avian vampire fly (Philornis downsi) is considered one of the greatest threats to the unique and endemic avifauna of the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. The fly parasitizes nearly every passerine species, including Darwins finches, in the Galapagos. The fly is thought to have been introduced from mainland Ecuador, although the full pathway of invasion is not yet known. The majority of research to date has focused on the effects of the fly on the fitness of avian hosts and explorations of mitigation methods. A lag in research related to the genetics of this invasion demonstrates, in part, a need to develop full-scale genomic resources with which to address further questions within this system. In this study, an adult P. downsi collected from San Cristobal Island within the Galapagos archipelago was sequenced to generate a high-quality genome assembly. We examined various features of the genome (e.g., coding regions, non-coding transposable elements) and carried out comparative genomics analysis against other dipteran genomes. We identified lists of gene families that are significantly expanding/contracting in P. downsi that are related to insecticide resistance, detoxification, and potential feeding ecology and counter defense against host immune responses. The P. downsi genome assembly provides an important foundational resource for studying the molecular basis of its successful invasion in the Galapagos and the dynamics of its population across multiple islands. The findings of significantly changing gene families associated with insecticide resistance and immune responses highlight the need for further investigations into the role of different gene families in aiding the flys successful invasion. Furthermore, this genomic resource will also better help inform future research studies and mitigation strategies aimed at minimizing the flys impact on the birds of the Galapagos.",

    "abstract": "DRD2 is a neuronal cell surface protein involved in brain development and function. Variations in the Drd2 gene have clinical significance since DRD2 is a pharmacotherapeutic target for treating psychiatric disorders like ADHD and schizophrenia. Despite numerous studies on the disease association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the intronic regions, investigation into the coding regions is surprisingly limited. In this study, we aimed at identifying potential functionally and pharmaco-therapeutically deleterious non-synonymous SNPs of Drd2. A wide array of bioinformatics tools was used to evaluate the impact of nsSNPs on protein structure and functionality. Out of 260 nsSNPs retrieved from the dbSNP database, initially 9 were predicted as deleterious by 15 tools. Upon further assessment of their domain association, conservation profile, homology models and inter-atomic interaction, the mutant F389V was considered as the most impactful. In-depth analysis of F389V through Molecular Docking and Dynamics Simulation revealed a decline in affinity for its native agonist dopamine and an increase in affinity for the antipsychotic drug risperidone. Remarkable alterations in binding interactions and stability of the protein-ligand complex in simulated physiological conditions were also noted. These findings will improve our understanding of the consequence of nsSNPs in disease-susceptibility and therapeutic efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements are an abundant source of transcription factor binding sites and favorable genomic integration may lead to their recruitment by the host genome for gene regulatory functions. However, it is unclear how frequent co-option of transposable elements as regulatory elements is, to which regulatory programs they contribute and how they compare to regulatory elements devoid of transposable elements. Here, we report a transcription initiation-centric, in-depth characterization of the transposon-derived regulatory landscape of mouse embryonic stem cells. We demonstrate that a substantial number of transposable elements, in particular endogenous retroviral elements, carry open chromatin regions that are divergently transcribed into unstable RNAs in a cell-type specific manner, and that these elements contribute to a sizable proportion of active enhancers and gene promoters. We further show that transposon subfamilies contribute differently and distinctly to the pluripotency regulatory program through their repertoires of transcription factor binding sites, shedding light on the formation of regulatory programs and the origins of regulatory elements.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play crucial roles in various aspects of post-transcriptional gene expression; their functions can vary between tissues, cell types, developmental stages, and environmental conditions. Identifying RBP target RNAs and investigating whether they are differentially bound by RBPs in different cell types, stages, or conditions could shed light on RBP functions. Although several strategies have been designed to identify RBP targets, they involve complicated biochemical steps and require large quantities of material, and only a few studies using these techniques have been performed in plants. The TRIBE (targets of RNA binding proteins identified by editing) method was recently developed to identify RBP targets using a RBP coupled to the catalytic domain of a Drosophila RNA editing enzyme and expressing this fusion protein in vivo. The resulting novel editing events can be identified by sequencing. This technique uses little material and does not require complex biochemical steps, however it is not yet adapted for use in plants.\n\nResultsWe successfully applied an optimized genome-wide TRIBE method in plants. We selected the splicing regulator polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) as a model protein for testing the TRIBE system in the moss Physcomitrium patens. We demonstrated that 13.81% of protein-coding gene transcripts in P. patens are targets of PTB. Most potential PTB binding sites are located in coding sequences and 3 untranslated regions, suggesting that PTB performs multiple functions besides pre-mRNA splicing in this moss. In addition, TRIBE showed reproducible results compared to other methods.\n\nConclusionsWe have developed an alternative method based on the TRIBE system to identify RBP targets in plants globally, and we provide guidance here for its application in plants.",

    "abstract": "Mechanosensitive ion channels mediate transmembrane ion currents activated by mechanical forces. A mechanosensitive ion channel called TACAN was recently reported. We began to study TACAN with the intent to understand how it senses mechanical forces and functions as an ion channel. Using cellular patch-recording methods we failed to identify mechanosensitive ion channel activity. Using membrane reconstitution methods we found that TACAN, at high protein concentrations, produces non-selective, heterogeneous conduction levels that are not mechanosensitive and are most consistent with disruptions of the lipid bilayer. We determined the structure of TACAN using single particle cryo-EM and observe that it forms a symmetrical dimeric transmembrane protein. Each protomer contains an intracellular-facing cleft with a coenzyme-A co-factor, confirmed by mass spectrometry. The TACAN protomers are related in 3-dimensional structure to a fatty acid elongase, ELOVL. Whilst its physiological function remains unclear, we anticipate that TACAN is not a mechanosensitive ion channel.",

    "abstract": "Homeostatic plasticity maintains network stability by adjusting excitation, inhibition, or the intrinsic excitability of neurons, but the developmental regulation and coordination of these distinct forms of homeostatic plasticity remains poorly understood. A major contributor to this information gap is the lack of a uniform paradigm for chronically manipulating activity at different developmental stages. To overcome this limitation, we utilized Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to directly suppress neuronal activity in layer (L) 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex (V1) at two important developmental timepoints: the classic visual system critical period (CP, P24-29), and adulthood (P45-55). We show that 24 hours of DREADD-mediated activity suppression simultaneously induces excitatory synaptic scaling up and intrinsic homeostatic plasticity in L2/3 pyramidal neurons during the CP, consistent with previous observations using prolonged visual deprivation. Importantly, manipulations known to block these forms of homeostatic plasticity when induced pharmacologically or via visual deprivation also prevented DREADD-induced homeostatic plasticity. We next used the same paradigm to suppress activity in adult animals. Surprisingly, while excitatory synaptic scaling persisted into adulthood, intrinsic homeostatic plasticity was completely absent. Finally, we found that homeostatic changes in quantal inhibitory input onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons were absent during the CP but present in adults. Thus, the same population of neurons can express distinct sets of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms at different development stages. Our findings suggest that homeostatic forms of plasticity can be recruited in a modular manner according to the evolving needs of a developing neural circuit.\n\nSignificance statementDeveloping brain circuits are subject to dramatic changes in inputs that could destabilize activity if left uncompensated. This compensation is achieved through a set of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that provide slow, negative feedback adjustments to excitability. Given that circuits are subject to very different destabilizing forces during distinct developmental stages, the forms of homeostatic plasticity present in the network must be tuned to these evolving needs. Here we developed a method to induce comparable homeostatic compensation during distinct developmental windows, and found that neurons in the juvenile and mature brain engage strikingly different forms of homeostatic plasticity. Thus, homeostatic mechanisms can be recruited in a modular manner according to the developmental needs of the circuit.",

    "abstract": "The overuse of antibiotics has resulted in the development of drug resistant, a major problem in disease curing processes i.e. development of drug resistance. The World Health Organization (WHO) released its first list of the most concerning pathogens for human health in 2017 which suggested that there are total 12 bacterial families which have developed multiple drug resistance and for which novel antibiotics are required immediately (WHO 2017). There is a requirement to explore some novel compounds to overcome this issue. Thus our study aimed at exploration of marine actinomycetes as a valuable resource for novel products with antimicrobial properties. The halophilic actinomycete Nocardiopsis_sp. Al-H10-1 (KF384482) was isolated from saline water (20 m away from shore) of Alang coast (Gulf of Khambhat), Bhavnagar, Gujarat, India. The isolate Al-H10-1 was identified as Nocardiopsis sp. through rigorous morphological and cultural characteristics; the species was confirmed through 16s rRNA phylogenetic analysis. The antimicrobial potential of Nocardiopsis sp. Al-H10-1 was assessed against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as three fungi, there it demonstrated antimicrobial activity against four Gram negative bacteria and one Gram positive bacteria. Further active antimicrobial compounds present in ethyl acetate extract was identified using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS). GC-MS analysis showed the presence of 17 compounds which included antimicrobial compounds like 2, 4-bis (1, 1-dimethylethyl)-Phenol, Dibutyl phthalate as well as various types of alkanes and their derivatives.",

    "abstract": "Defective interfering (DI) genomes restrict viral replication and induce type-I interferon. Since DI genomes have been proposed as vaccine adjuvants or therapeutic antiviral agents, it is important to understand their generation, delineate their mechanism of action, develop robust production capacities, assess their safety and in vivo longevity and determine their long-term effects. To address this, we generated a recombinant (r) canine distemper virus (CDV) from an entirely synthetic molecular clone designed using the genomic sequence from a clinical isolate obtained from a free-ranging raccoon with distemper. rCDV was serially passaged in vitro to identify DI genomes that naturally arise during rCDV replication. Defective genomes were identified by Sanger and next-generation sequencing techniques and predominant genomes were synthetically generated and cloned into T7-driven plasmids. Fully encapsidated DI particles (DIPs) were then generated using a rationally attenuated rCDV as a producer virus to drive DI genome replication. We demonstrate these DIPs interfere with rCDV replication in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Finally, we show sustained replication of a fluorescent DIP in experimentally infected ferrets over a period of 14 days. Most importantly, DIPs were isolated from the lymphoid tissues which are a major site of CDV replication. Our established pipeline for detection, generation and assaying DIPs is transferable to highly pathogenic paramyxoviruses and will allow qualitative and quantitative assessment of the therapeutic effects of DIP administration on disease outcome.\n\nImportanceDefective interfering (DI) genomes have long been considered inconvenient artifacts that suppressed viral replication in vitro. However, advances in sequencing technologies have led to DI genomes being identified in clinical samples, implicating them in disease progression and outcome. It has been suggested that DI genomes could be harnessed therapeutically. Negative strand RNA virus research has provided a rich pool of natural DI genomes over many years and they are probably the best understood in vitro. Here, we demonstrate identification, synthesis, production and experimental inoculation of novel CDV DI genomes in highly susceptible ferrets. These results provide important evidence that rationally designed and packaged DI genomes can survive the course of a wild-type virus infection.",

Here, we characterized two polyketide synthase gene clusters (fun and pks) in the gut symbiont Limosilactobacillus reuteri. The pks, but not the fun cluster, encodes antimicrobial activity. Forty-one out of 51 L. reuteri strains tested are sensitive to Pks products, which was independent of strains host origin. The sensitivity to Pks was also established in intraspecies competition experiments in gnotobiotic mice. Comparative genome analyses between Pks-resistant and sensitive strains identified an acyltransferase gene (act) that is unique to Pks-resistant strains. Subsequent cell wall analysis of the wild-type and the act mutant strains showed that Act acetylates cell wall components. The pks mutants lost their competitive advantage and act mutants lost their Pks resistance in vivo. Thus, our findings provide insight into how closely related gut symbionts can compete and co- exist in the gastrointestinal tract.",

While some researchers claim that kleptoplasts are slowly digestible  snacks, others advocate that they enhance the overall fitness of sea slugs much more profoundly. Our analysis show light-dependent incorporation of 13C and 15N in the albumen gland and gonadal follicles of the sea slug Elysia timida, representing translocation of photosynthates to kleptoplast-free reproductive organs.

    "abstract": "Dysregulated transcription factors represent a major class of drug targets that mediate the abnormal expression of many critical genes involved in SLE and other autoimmune diseases. Although strong evidence suggests that natural human genetic variation affects basal and inducible gene expression, it is still a considerable challenge to establish a biological link between GWAS-identified non-coding genetic risk variants and their regulated gene targets. Here, we combine genetic data, epigenomic data, and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) assays to screen for functional variants regulating IRF8 expression. Using CRISPR-mediated deletion and 3D chromatin structure analysis, we demonstrate that the locus containing rs2280381 is a cell-type-specific distal enhancer for IRF8 that spatially interacts with the IRF8 promoter. Further, rs2280381 mediates IRF8 expression through enhancer RNA AC092723.1, which recruits TET1 to the IRF8 promoter to modulate IRF8 expression by affecting methylation levels. The alleles of rs2280381 modulate PU.1 binding and chromatin state to differentially regulate AC092723.1 and IRF8 expression. Our work illustrates a strategy to define the functional genetic variants modulating transcription factor gene expression levels and identifies the biologic mechanism by which autoimmune diseases risk genetic variants contribute to the pathogenesis of disease.",

    "abstract": "PurposeWe sought to exploit the heterogeneity afforded by patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) to optimize robust radiomic features associated with response to therapy in the context of a co-clinical trial and implement PDX-optimized image features in the corresponding clinical study to predict and assess response to therapy using machine-learning (ML) algorithms.\n\nMethodsTNBC patients and subtype-matched PDX were recruited into a co-clinical FDG-PET imaging study to predict response to therapy. One hundred thirty-one imaging features were extracted from PDX and human segmented tumors. Robust image features were identified based on reproducibility, cross-correlation, and volume independence. A rank importance of predictors using ReliefF was used to identify predictive radiomic features in the preclinical PDX trial in conjunction with ML algorithms: classification and regression tree (CART), Naive Bayes (NB), and support vector machines (SVM). The top four PDX-optimized image features, defined as radiomic signatures (RadSig), from each task were then used to predict or assess response to therapy. Performance of RadSig in predicting/assessing response was compared to SUVmean, SUVmax, and lean body mass normalized SULpeak measures.\n\nResultsSixty-four out of 131 preclinical imaging features were identified as robust.

    "abstract": "Phosphorylation of Akt (pAkt) regulates multiple physiological and pathological processes including thrombosis and inflammation. In an approach to inhibit the pathological signalling of pAkt by prolyl-hydroxylase-2 (PHD2) we employed -ketoglutarate (KG), a cofactor of PHD2. Octyl-KG supplementation to platelets promoted PHD2 activity through elevated intracellular KG:succinate ratio and reduced aggregation in vitro by suppressing pAkt1(Thr308). Augmented PHD2 activity was confirmed by increased hydroxylated-proline alongside enhanced binding of PHD2 to pAkt in KG-treated platelets. Contrastingly, inhibitors of PHD2 significantly increased pAkt1 in platelets. Octyl-KG followed similar mechanism in monocytes to inhibit cytokine secretion in vitro. Our data also describe a suppressed pAkt1 and reduced activation of platelet and leukocyte obtained from mice supplemented with dietary-KG, unaccompanied by alteration in their counts. Dietary-KG significantly reduced clot formation and leukocyte accumulation in various organs including lung of mice treated with thrombosis-inducing agent carrageenan. Importantly, we observed a significant rescue effect of dietary-KG on inflamed lung of SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters. KG significantly reduced leukocyte accumulation, clot formation and viral load alongside downmodulation of pAkt in lung of the infected animals. Therefore, our study suggests a safe implementation of dietary-KG in prevention of Akt-driven anomalies including thrombosis and inflammation, highlighting a better pulmonary management in COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Plasticizers are commonly used in different consumer goods and personal care products to provide flexibility, durability and elasticity to polymers. Due to their reported toxicity, the use of several plasticizers including phthalates has been regulated and/or banned from the market. Di(isononyl) cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (DINCH) is an alternative plasticizer that was introduced to replace toxic plasticizers. Increasing global demand and lack of information regarding toxicity and safety assessment of DINCH have raised the concern to human and animal health. Hence, in the present study, we investigated the adverse effects of DINCH (at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10 M) in early developmental stages of zebrafish using different endpoints such as hatching rate, developmental abnormalities, lipid metabolism, behavior analysis and gene expression. We found that DINCH caused hatching delay in a dose-dependent manner and altered the expression of genes involved in stress response. Lipid staining using Oil Red O stain showed a slight lipid accumulation around the yolk, brain, eye and neck with increasing concentration. Genes associated with lipid metabolism such as fatty acid synthesis, {beta}-oxidation, elongation, lipid transport were significantly altered by DINCH. Behavioral analysis of larvae demonstrated a distinct locomotor activity including distance and acceleration upon exposure to DINCH both in light and dark. Genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and homeostasis were also affected by DINCH indicating possible developmental neurotoxicity. The present data shows that DINCH could induce physiological and metabolic toxicity to aquatic organisms. Hence, further analyses and environmental monitoring on DINCH should be conducted to determine its safety and toxicity levels.",

We develop a CRISPR-FnCpf1-RecT genome-editing tool to study 23 PULs in the highly abundant species B. uniformis (BU). We identify the glycan-degrading functions of multiple PULs and elucidate transcriptional coordination between PULs that enables the population to adapt to the loss of PULs. Exploiting a pooled BU mutant barcoding strategy, we demonstrate that the in vitro fitness and the colonization ability of BU in the murine gut is enhanced by deletion of specific PULs and modulated by glycan availability. We show that BU PULs can mediate complex glycan-dependent interactions with butyrate producers that depend on the mechanism of degradation and the butyrate producer glycan utilizing ability. In sum, PULs are major determinants of community dynamics and butyrate production and can provide a selective advantage or disadvantage depending on the nutritional landscape.",

It is unclear how the two processes are coordinated in the same brain regions, especially in the hippocampal CA1 region where the two processes converge at the cellular level. Here we find that the neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NDNF)-positive interneurons at stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) in CA1 play opposite roles in memory encoding and retrieval. These interneurons show high activities in learning and low activities in recall. Increasing their activity facilitates learning but impairs recall. They inhibit the entorhinal- but dis-inhibit the CA3- inputs to CA1 pyramidal cells and thereby either suppress or elevate CA1 pyramidal cells activity depending on animals behavioral states. Thus, by coordinating entorhinal- and CA3- dual inputs to CA1, these SLM interneurons are key to switching the hippocampus between encoding and retrieval modes.",

In this study, we established a silkworm (Bombyx mori) infection model of B. anthracis Sterne. We showed that silkworms were killed by B. anthracis and cured of the infection when administered with antibiotics. We quantitatively determined the lethal dose of the bacteria that kills 50% larvae and effective doses of antibiotics that cure 50% infected larvae. Furthermore, we demonstrated that B. anthracis mutants with disruption in virulence genes such as pagA, lef, and atxA had attenuated silkworm-killing ability and reduced colonization in silkworm hemolymph. The silkworm infection model established in this study can be utilized in large-scale infection experiments to identify novel virulence determinants and develop novel therapeutic options against B. anthracis infections.",

There are minimal attempts to examine the molecular and functional attributes shared by agricultural and clinical strains of P. aeruginosa. This study aims to investigate the presence of P. aeruginosa in edible vegetable plants (including salad vegetables) and analyze the evolutionary and metabolic relatedness of the agricultural and clinical strains. Eighteen rhizospheric and endophytic P. aeruginosa strains were isolated from cucumber, tomato, eggplant, and chili directly from the farms. The identity of these strains was confirmed using biochemical, and molecular markers and their genetic and metabolic traits were compared with clinical isolates. DNA fingerprinting analyses and 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic tree revealed that the plant- and human-associated strains are evolutionarily related. Both agricultural and clinical isolates possessed plant-beneficial properties, including mineral solubilization (phosphorous, potassium, and zinc), ammonification, and the ability to release extracellular siderophore and indole-3 acetic acid. These findings suggest that rhizospheric and endophytic P. aeruginosa strains are genetically and functionally analogous to the clinical isolates. This study highlights the edible plants as a potential source for human and animal transmission of P. aeruginosa.",

Here, we present the development and evaluation of the use of the ODity platform to optically measure bacterial cell densities non-invasively. The digital growth data for E. coli MG1655 was calibrated against colony forming units (CFU/mL) obtained by plating on solid media. Diauxic-like shifts of liquid E. coli MG1655 cultures grown at 37{degrees}C in LB media were observed at densities as low as 2.9 x 107 {+/-} 1.2 CFU/mL. The shift occurred at a significantly higher cell density (6.0 x 107 {+/-} 1.2 CFU/mL) when the bacteria were cultured at 31{degrees}C. These shifts were only short lived, 15.2 {+/-} 1.5 and 20.8 {+/-} 1.8 min at 37{degrees}C and 31{degrees}C, respectively, with the previous growth rate restored thereafter. We measured minimum doubling times of 17.0 {+/-} 1.1 and 24.8 {+/-} 0.9 min at 37{degrees}C and 31{degrees}C, respectively.

    "abstract": "Vaginal microbiota composition affects several important reproductive health outcomes. Lactobacillus crispatus-dominant bacterial communities have favorable associations whereas anaerobe-dominant communities deficient of lactobacilli are linked to poor outcomes, including bacterial vaginosis (BV). Lactobacillus iners, the most abundant vaginal species worldwide, has adverse associations compared to L. crispatus, but standard metronidazole treatment for BV promotes L. iners-dominance, likely contributing to post-treatment relapse. L. iners is under-studied because it fails to grow in standard Lactobacillus media in vitro. Here we trace this in vitro phenotype to a species-specific cysteine requirement associated with limitations in cysteine-related transport mechanisms and show that vaginal cysteine concentrations correlate with Lactobacillus abundance in vivo. We demonstrate that cystine uptake inhibitors selectively impede L. iners growth and that combining an inhibitor with metronidazole thus promotes L. crispatus dominance of defined BV-like communities. These findings identify a novel target for therapeutic vaginal microbiota modulation to improve reproductive health.",

Yet, contrary to single infection, the factors that shape co-infection risk are largely under-investigated. Here, we explored the extent to which bird ecology and phylogeny impact single and co-infection probabilities by haemosporidian parasites using large datasets from museum collections and a Bayesian phylogenetic modelling framework. While both phylogeny and species attributes (e.g. size of the geographic range, life-history strategy, migration) were relevant predictors of co-infection risk, these factors were less pertinent in predicting the probability of being single infected. Our study suggests that co-infection risk is under a stronger deterministic control than single-infection risk. These results underscore the combined influence of host evolutionary history and species attributes in determining single and co-infection pattern providing new avenues regarding our ability to predict infection risk in the wild.",

Currently, it is unclear whether social connectedness declines within individuals as they age, and what the underlying mechanisms might be, so the role of age in structuring animal social systems remains unresolved, particularly in non-primates. Here, we describe senescent declines in social connectedness using 43 years of data in a wild, individually monitored population of a long-lived mammal (European red deer, Cervus elaphus). Applying a series of spatial and social network analyses, we demonstrate that these declines occur due to within-individual changes in social behaviour, with correlated changes in spatial behaviour (smaller home ranges and movements to lower-density, lower-quality areas). These findings demonstrate that within-individual socio-spatial behavioural changes can lead older animals in fission-fusion societies to become less socially connected, shedding light on the ecological and evolutionary processes structuring wild animal populations.",

    "abstract": "Determining how and how often asexual lineages emerge within sexual species is central to our understanding of sex-asex transitions and the long-term maintenance of sex. Asexuality can arise \"by transmission\" from an existing asexual lineage to a new one, through different types of crosses. The occurrence of these crosses, cryptic sex, variation in ploidy and recombination within asexuals greatly complicates the study of sex-asex transitions, as they preclude the use of standard phylogenetic methods and genetic distance metrics. In this study we show how to overcome these challenges by developing new approaches to investigate the origin of the various asexual lineages of the brine shrimp Artemia parthenogenetica. We use a large sample of asexuals, including all known polyploids, and their sexual relatives. We combine flow cytometry with mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data. We develop new genetic distance measures and methods to compare various scenarios describing the origin of the different lineages. We find that all diploid and polyploid A. parthenogenetica likely arose within the last 80,000 years through successive and nested hybridization events that involved backcrosses with different sexual species. All A. parthenogenetica have the same common ancestor and therefore likely carry the same asexuality gene(s) and reproduce by automixis. These findings radically change our view of sex-asex transitions in this group, and show the importance of considering asexuality \"by transmission\" scenarios. The methods developed are applicable to many other asexual taxa.",

    "abstract": "Genetic diversity, kinship and population genetic structure analyses of Gossypium hirsutum germplasm can provide a better understanding of the origin and evolution of G. hirsutum biodiversity. In this study, 1313331 SNP molecular markers were used to construct a phylogenetic tree of each sample using MEGAX, to perform population structure analysis by ADMIXTURE software and principal component analysis (PCA) by EIGENSOFT software, and to estimate relatedness using SPAGeDi. ADMIXTURE software divided the experimental cotton population into 16 subgroups, and the Gossypium hirsutum samples could be roughly clustered according to source place, but there were some overlapping characteristics among samples. The experimental cotton population was divided into six groups according to source to calculate the genetic diversity index (H), and the obtained value (0.306) was close to that for germplasm collected by others in China. Cluster 4 had a relatively high genetic diversity level (0.390). The degrees of genetic differentiation within the experimental cotton population groups were low (the population differentiation indexes ranged from 0.02368 to 0.10664). The genetic distance among cotton accessions varied from 0.000332651 to 0.562664014, with an average of 0.25240429. The results of this study may provide a basis for mining elite alleles and using them for subsequent association analysis.",

Recent spatial transcriptomics experiments utilize slides containing thousands of spots with spot-specific barcodes that bind mRNA. Ideally, unique molecular identifiers at a spot measure spot-specific expression, but this is often not the case owing to bleed from nearby spots, an artifact we refer to as spot swapping. We propose SpotClean to adjust for spot swapping and, in doing so, to increase the sensitivity and precision with which downstream analyses are conducted.",

    "abstract": "Detecting mutations as rare as a single molecule is crucial in many fields such as cancer diagnostics and aging research but remains challenging. Third generation sequencers can read a double-stranded DNA molecule (a  single duplex) in whole to identify true mutations on both strands apart from false mutations on either strand but with limited accuracy and throughput. Although next generation sequencing (NGS) can track dissociated strands with Duplex Sequencing, the need to sequence each strand independently severely diminishes its throughput. Here, we developed a hybrid method called Concatenating Original Duplex for Error Correction (CODEC) that combines the massively parallel nature of NGS with the single-molecule capability of third generation sequencing. CODEC physically links both strands to enable NGS to sequence a single duplex with a single read pair. By comparing CODEC and Duplex Sequencing, we showed that CODEC achieved a similar error rate (10-6) with 100 times fewer reads and conferred  single duplex resolution to most major NGS workflows.",

    "abstract": "Filamentous actinobacteria such as Streptomyces undergo two distinct modes of cell division, leading to partitioning of growing hyphae into multicellular compartments via cross-walls, and to septation and release of unicellular spores. Specific determinants for cross-wall formation and the importance of hyphal compartmentalization for Streptomyces development are largely unknown. Here we show that SepX, an actinobacterial-specific protein, is crucial for both cell division modes in Streptomyces venezuelae. Importantly, we find that sepX-deficient mutants grow without cross-walls and that this substantially impairs the fitness of colonies and the coordinated progression through the developmental life cycle. Protein interaction studies and live-cell imaging suggest that SepX contributes to the stabilization of the divisome, a mechanism that also requires the dynamin-like protein DynB. Thus, our work identifies an important determinant for cell division in Streptomyces that is required for cellular development and sporulation.",

    "abstract": "Gadolinium is a key component of magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents that are critical tools for enhanced detection and diagnosis of tissue and vascular abnormalities. Untargeted post-injection deposition of gadolinium in vivo, and association with diseases like nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, has alerted regulatory agencies to re-evaluate their widespread use and generated calls for safer gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). Increasing anthropogenic gadolinium in surface water has also raised concerns of potential bioaccumulation in plants and animals. Methylotrophic bacteria can acquire, transport, store and use light lanthanides as part of a cofactor complex with pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), an essential component of XoxF-type methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs), a critical enzyme for methylotrophic growth with methanol. We report robust gadolinium-dependent methanol growth of a genetic variant of Methylorubrum extorquens AM1, named evo-HLn, for \"evolved for heavy lanthanides\". Genetic adaptation of evo-HLn resulted in increased xox1 promoter and XoxF MDH activities, transport and storage of Gd3+, and augmented biosynthesis of PQQ. Gadolinium-grown cells exhibited a shorter T1 relaxation time compared to cells with lanthanum or no lanthanide when analyzed by MRI. In addition, evo-HLn was able to grow on methanol using the GBCA Gd-DTPA as the sole gadolinium source, showing the potential of this strain for the development of novel GBCAs and gadolinium recovery from medical waste and/or wastewater.",

However, not all individuals with alpha-synuclein variants develop PD, suggesting that additional factors are involved. We hypothesized that increased alpha-synuclein might alter epigenetic regulation of PD pathways.\n\nObjectivesTo identify genome-wide DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation changes induced by overexpression of two alpha-synuclein variants in human dopaminergic neurons, and to relate these to the corresponding transcriptome.\n\nMethodsWe assessed DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation at >850,000 CpGs using the EPIC BeadChip in LUHMES cells differentiated to dopaminergic neurons. Control LUHMES neurons, LUHMES neurons overexpressing wild type alpha-synuclein, and LUHMES neurons overexpressing A30P alpha-synuclein were compared. We used SMITE network analysis to identify functionally related genes with altered DNA methylation, DNA hydroxymethylation, and/or gene expression, incorporating LUHMES H3K4me1 ChIP-seq to delineate enhancers in addition to the default promoter and gene body regions.\n\nResultsUsing stringent statistical thresholds, we found that increased expression of wild type or A30P mutant alpha-synuclein induced DNA methylation changes at thousands of CpGs and DNA hydroxymethylation changes at hundreds of CpGs. Differentially methylated sites in both genotypes were enriched for several processes including movement-associated pathways and glutamate signaling. For glutamate and other signaling pathways (i.e. PDGF, insulin), this differential DNA methylation was also associated with transcriptional changes.\n\nConclusionsOur results indicated that alpha-synuclein altered the DNA methylome of dopaminergic neurons, influencing regulation of pathways involved in development, signaling, and metabolism. This supports a role for alpha-synuclein in the epigenetic etiology of PD.",

    "abstract": "Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) lies at the interface between perceptual and memory networks in the brain and mediates between these, although it is not yet known how. It has two distinct subregions, granular (gRSC) and dysgranular (dRSC). The present study investigated how these subregions differ with respect to their electrophysiology and connections, as a step towards understanding their functions. gRSC is more closely connected to the hippocampal system, in which theta-band local field potential oscillations are prominent. We therefore compared theta-rhythmic single-unit activity between the two RSC subregions and found, mostly in gRSC, a subpopulation of non-directional cells with spiking activity strongly entrained by theta oscillations, suggesting a stronger coupling of gRSC to the hippocampal system. We then used retrograde tracers to examine whether differences in neural coding between RSC subregions might reflect differential inputs from the anterior thalamus, which is a prominent source of RSC afferents. We found that gRSC and dRSC differ in their afferents from two AV subfields: dorsomedial (AVDM) and ventrolateral (AVVL). AVVL targets both gRSC and dRSC, while AVDM provides a selective projection to gRSC. These combined results suggest the existence of two distinct but interacting RSC subcircuits: one connecting AVDM to gRSC that may comprise part of the cognitive hippocampal system, and the other connecting AVVL to both RSC regions that may link hippocampal and perceptual regions. We suggest that these subcircuits are distinct to allow for differential weighting during integration of converging sensory and cognitive computations: an integration that may take place in thalamus, RSC or both.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe two retrosplenial cortex subregions, gRSC and dRSC, differ in their temporal firing characteristics and relation to theta oscillations.\nC_LIO_LIThere are differential afferents from the anteroventral thalamic nucleus to gRSC and dRSC, with the dorsomedial subnucleus projecting selectively to gRSC.\nC_LIO_LIThe anteroventral thalamus-retrosplenial cortex circuitry thus comprises two functionally and anatomically distinct but connected circuits, differentially connected to the hippocampal system, that may support the integration of cognitive and perceptual information.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The ability to separate background noise from relevant acoustic signals is essential for appropriate sound-driven behavior in natural environments. Examples of this separation are apparent in the auditory system, where neural responses to behaviorally relevant stimuli become increasingly noise-invariant along the ascending auditory pathway. However, the mechanisms that underlie this reduction in responses to background noise are not well understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we first evaluated the effects of auditory cortical inactivation on mice of both sexes trained to perform a simple auditory signal-in-noise detection task, and found that outputs from the auditory cortex are important for the detection of auditory stimuli in noisy environments. Next, we evaluated the contributions of the two most common cortical inhibitory cell types, parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) and somatostatin-expressing (SOM+) interneurons, to the perception of masked auditory stimuli. We found that inactivation of either PV+ or SOM+ cells resulted in a reduction in the ability of mice to determine the presence of auditory stimuli masked by noise. These results indicate that a disruption of auditory cortical network dynamics by either of these two types of inhibitory cells is sufficient to impair the ability to separate acoustic signals from noise.\n\nSignificance StatementAppropriate behavior in a natural environment relies on the ability to separate background noise from relevant signals. We found that auditory cortical inhibitory neurons play a causal role in separating environmental noise from behaviorally relevant auditory signals. These results advance our understanding of the computations performed by the auditory system to decompose and analyze acoustic stimuli in the presence of noise.",
