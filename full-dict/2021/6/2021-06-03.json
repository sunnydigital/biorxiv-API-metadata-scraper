    "abstract": "Skeletal muscles are involved in responses to acute hypoxia as the largest organ in the body. However, as a hypoxic-tolerant tissue, responses in skeletal muscles caused by acute sedentary hypoxia are much less studied. We measured metabolites in skeletal muscles from mice exposed to 8% O2 for 0 minute, 15 minutes and 2 hours and studied the potential relationship between metabolite levels and mRNA levels by reconstructing genome-based metabolic networks and meta-analyzing differentially expressed genes acquired in skeletal muscles after 2 hours of 8% O2 exposure. The metabolite measurement indicated a significant increase in glutamine metabolism but not lactate metabolism in mouse skeletal muscles after 2 hours of hypoxia, where the metabolic responses as a whole were moderate. The central-dogma based metabolic flux analysis suggested an involvement of glutamine metabolism, though, as a whole, metabolite changes and gene changes didnt show a high correlation. Among metaoblites, glutamine metabolism indicated a significant response and a consistent change which could be interpreted by genome-based network analysis. In summary, though this study suggested a moderate metabolic response which has a weak correlation with gene expression change as a whole, glutamine metabolism indicated rapid responses in skeletal muscles responding to acute sedentary hypoxia.",

    "abstract": "Synthesis of gene products in bursts of multiple molecular copies is an important source of gene expression variability. This paper studies large deviations in a Markovian drift-jump process that combines exponentially distributed bursts with deterministic degradation. Large deviations occur as a cumulative effect of many bursts (as in diffusion) or, if the model includes negative feedback in burst size, in a single big jump. The latter possibility requires a modification in the WKB solution in the tail region. The main result of the paper is the construction, via a modified WKB scheme, of matched asymptotic approximations to the stationary distribution of the drift-jump process. The stationary distribution possesses a heavier tail than predicted by a routine application of the scheme.\n\nMSC 202092C40; 60J76, 45D05, 41A60",

    "abstract": "The hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is a critical regulator of physiologic and psychological responses to acute and chronic stressors. HPA axis function is control by numerous feedback inhibitory mechanisms, disruptions of which can lead to various psychiatric conditions, such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia. Vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of in these various mental health issues potentially via modulation of HPA axis function, but the mechanisms by which the vagus nerve may regulate HPA function has not been fully elucidated. In the present studies, we sought to test the hypothesis that the vagus nerve is a critical regulator of HPA function. Neuroendocrine function and neurocircuit changes in corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) were examined following acute stress after subdiaphragmatic left vagotomy (VX) in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. We found that VX mimics HPA activation seen in sham surgery animals exposed to acute restraint stress, particularly increased plasma corticosterone levels, elevated PVN CRF mRNA, and increased action potential firing of putative CRF neurons in PVN brain slices. Furthermore, VX animals exposed to acute restraint stress showed increased elevations of plasma corticosterone and PVN CRF mRNA which may be due to lack of compensatory PVN GABAergic signaling in response to acute stress. Both Sham/Stress and VX/no stress conditions increased action potential firing in putative PVN CRF neurons, but this effect was not seen in the VX/stress condition, suggesting that not all forms of stress compensation are lost following VX. Overall, these findings suggest that the vagus nerve may play a critical role in regulating HPA axis function via modulation of local PVN neurocircuit activity.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by loss of motor neurons and characterized neuropathologically in almost all cases by nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43, a nuclear RNA binding protein (RBP). We identified ELAVL3 as one of the most downregulated genes in our transcriptome profiles of laser captured microdissection of motor neurons from sporadic ALS nervous systems and the top dysregulated RBPs. Neuropathological characterizations showed ELAVL3 nuclear depletion in a great percentage of remnant motor neurons, sometimes accompanied by cytoplasmic accumulations. These abnormalities were common in sporadic cases with and without intermediate expansions in ATXN2 and familial cases carrying mutations in C9orf72 and SOD1. Depletion of ELAVL3 occurred at both the RNA and protein levels and a short protein isoform was identified but it is not related to a TDP-43-dependent cryptic exon in intron 3. Strikingly, ELAVL3 abnormalities were more frequent than TDP-43 abnormalities and occurred in motor neurons still with normal nuclear TDP-43 present, but all neurons with abnormal TDP-43 also had abnormal ELAVL3. In a neuron-like cell culture model using SH-SY5Y cells, ELAVL3 mislocalization occurred weeks before TDP-43 abnormalities were seen. We interrogated genetic databases but did not identify association of ELAVL3 genetic structure associated with ALS. Taken together, these findings suggest that ELAVL3 is an important RBP in ALS pathogenesis acquired early and the neuropathological data suggest it is involved by loss of function rather than cytoplasmic toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Cognition depends on resisting interference and responding to relevant stimuli. Distracting information, however, varies based on content, requiring distinct filtering mechanisms. For instance, affective information captures attention, disrupts performance and attenuates activation along frontal-parietal regions during cognitive engagement, while recruiting bottom-up regions. Conversely, distraction matching task features (i.e. task-similar) increases fronto-parietal activity. Neural mechanisms behind unique effects of different distraction on cognition remain unknown. Using fMRI in 45 adults, we tested whether affective versus task-similar interference show distinct signals during delayed working memory (WM). We found robust differences between distractor types along fronto-parietal versus affective-ventral neural systems. We studied a hypothesized mechanism of this effect via a biophysically-based computational WM model that implements a functional antagonism between affective/cognitive neural  modules. This architecture reproduced experimental effects: task-similar distractors increased, whereas affective distractors attenuated cognitive module activity while increasing affective module signals. The model architecture suggested that task-based connectivity may be altered in affective-ventral vs. fronto-parietal networks depending on distractor type. Empirically, affective interference significantly increased connectivity within the affective-ventral network, but reduced connectivity between affective-ventral and fronto-parietal networks, which predicted WM performance. These findings detail an antagonistic architecture between cognitive and affective systems, capable of flexibly engaging distinct distractions during cognition.",

    "abstract": "Motor memories undergo a period of consolidation before they become resistant to the practice of another task. Although movement variability is important in motor memory consolidation, its role is not fully understood in redundant tasks where variability can exist along two orthogonal subspaces (the  task space and the  null space) that have different effects on task performance. Here, we used haptic perturbations to augment variability in these different spaces and examined their effect on motor memory consolidation. Participants learned a shuffleboard task, where they held a bimanual manipulandum and made a discrete throwing motion to slide a virtual puck towards a target. The task was redundant because the distance travelled by the puck was determined by the sum of the left and right hand speeds at the time of release. After participants initially practiced the task, we used haptic perturbations to introduce motor variability in the task space or null space, and subsequently examined consolidation of the original task on the next day. We found that regardless of the amplitude, augmenting variability in the task space resulted in significantly better consolidation. This benefit of increasing task space variability was likely due to the fact that it did not disrupt the pre-existing coordination strategy. These results suggest that the effects of variability on motor memory consolidation depend on the interplay between the induced variability and the pre-existing coordination strategy.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe dynamic nature and complexity of the cellular events that take place during the last trimester of pregnancy make the developing cortex particularly vulnerable to perturbations. Abrupt interruption to normal gestation can lead to significant deviations to many of these processes, resulting in atypical trajectory of cortical maturation in preterm birth survivors.\n\nMethodsWe sought to first map typical cortical micro and macrostructure development using invivo MRI in a large sample of healthy term-born infants scanned after birth (n=270). Then we offer a comprehensive characterisation of the cortical consequences of preterm birth in 78 preterm infants scanned at term-equivalent age (37-44 weeks postmenstrual age). We describe the group-average atypicality, the heterogeneity across individual preterm infants, and relate individual deviations from normative development to age at birth and neurodevelopment at 18 months.\n\nResultsIn the term-born neonatal brain, we observed regionally specific age-associated changes in cortical morphology and microstructure, including rapid surface expansion, cortical thickness increase, reduction in cortical anisotropy and increase in neurite orientation dispersion. By term-equivalent age, preterm infants had on average increased cortical tissue water content and reduced neurite density index in the posterior parts of the cortex, and greater cortical thickness anteriorly compared to term-born infants. While individual preterm infants were more likely to show extreme deviations (over 3.1 standard deviations) from normative cortical maturation compared to term-born infants, these extreme deviations were highly variable and showed very little spatial overlap between individuals. Measures of regional cortical development were associated with age at birth, but not with neurodevelopment at 18 months.\n\nConclusionWe showed that preterm birth alters cortical micro and macrostructural maturation near the time of fullterm birth. Deviations from normative development were highly variable between individual preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "Motor neurons control muscle contractions, and their recruitment by premotor circuits is tuned to produce accurate motor behaviours. To understand how these circuits coordinate movement across and between joints, it is necessary to understand whether spinal neurons pre-synaptic to motor pools, project to more than one motor neuron population. Here, we used modified rabies virus tracing in mice to investigate premotor INs projecting to synergist flexor or extensor motor neurons, as well as those projecting to antagonist pairs of muscles controlling the ankle joint. We show that similar proportions of premotor neurons diverge to agonist and antagonist motor pools. Divergent premotor neurons were seen throughout the spinal cord, with decreasing numbers but increasing proportion with distance from the hindlimb enlargement. In the cervical cord, divergent long descending propriospinal neurons were found in contralateral lamina VIII, had large somata, were excitatory, projected to both lumbar and cervical motoneurons, and were at least in part of the V0 class. We conclude that distributed spinal premotor neurons coordinate activity across multiple motor pools and that there are spinal neurons mediating co-contraction of antagonist muscles.",

    "abstract": "As the most common cause of dementia, the study of Alzheimers disease (AD) faces challenges in terms of understanding the cause, monitoring the pathogenesis, and developing early diagnosis and effective treatment. Rapid and accurate identification of AD biomarkers in the brain is critical to provide key insights into AD and facilitate the development of early diagnosis methods. In this work, we developed a platform that enables a rapid screening of AD biomarkers by employing graphene-assisted Raman spectroscopy and machine learning interpretation in AD transgenic animal brains. Specifically, we collected Raman spectra on slices of mouse brains with and without AD and used machine learning to classify AD and non-AD spectra. By contacting monolayer graphene with the brain slices, the accuracy was significantly increased from 77% to 98% in machine learning classification. Further, using linear supporting vector machine (SVM), we identified a spectral feature importance map that reveals the importance of each Raman wavenumber in classifying AD and non-AD spectra. Based on this spectral feature importance map, we identified AD biomarkers including A{beta} and tau proteins, and other potential biomarkers, such as triolein, phosphatidylcholine, and actin, which have been confirmed by other biochemical studies. Our Raman-machine learning integrated method with interpretability is promising to greatly accelerate the study of AD and can be extended to other tissues, biofluids, and for various other diseases.",

To systematically investigate we analysed single cell transcriptomes from gestational week (GW) 8-26 human foetal prefrontal cortex and identified a subset of interneurons (INs) first appearing at GW23 with enriched expression of a disproportionately large fraction of risk factor transcripts. This suggests the hypothesis that these INs are disproportionately vulnerable to mutations causing autism. We investigated this in a rat model of the 16p11.2 microdeletion. We found no change in the numbers or position of either excitatory or inhibitory neurons in the somatosensory cortex or CA1 of 16p11.2+/- rats but found that CA1 Sst INs were hyperexcitable with an enlarged axon initial segment, which was not the case for CA1 pyramidal cells.

    "abstract": "Several X-linked genes are involved in neuronal differentiation and may contribute to the generation of sex dimorphisms in brain. Previous results showed that XX hypothalamic neurons grow faster, have longer axons, and exhibit higher expression of the neuritogenic gene neurogenin 3 (Ngn3) than XY before perinatal masculinization. Here we evaluated the participation of candidate X-linked genes in the development of these sex differences, focusing mainly on Kdm6a, a gene encoding for an H3K27 demethylase with functions controlling gene expression genome-wide. We established hypothalamic neuronal cultures from wild-type or transgenic Four Core Genotypes mice, a model that allows evaluating the effect of sex chromosomes independently of gonadal type. X-linked genes Kdm6a, Eif2s3x and Ddx3x showed higher expression in XX compared to XY neurons, regardless of gonadal sex. Moreover, Kdm6a expression pattern with higher mRNA levels in XX than XY did not change with age at E14, P0, and P60 in hypothalamus or under 17{beta}-estradiol treatment in culture. Kdm6a pharmacological blockade by GSK-J4 reduced the expression of neuritogenic genes Neurod1, Neurod2 and Cdk5r1 in both sexes equally, while a sex-specific effect was observed on Ngn3 levels, with a decrease in XX and an increase in XY neurons. Finally, both Kdm6a inhibition and its downregulation using siRNA reduced axonal length only in female neurons, abolishing the sex differences observed in control conditions. Altogether, these results point to Kdm6a as a key mediator of the higher axogenesis and Ngn3 expression observed in XX neurons before critical period of brain masculinization.",

    "abstract": "Beneficial and probiotic bacteria play an important role in conferring the immunity of their hosts against a wide range of bacterial, viral and fungal diseases. B. subtilis is a bacterium that protects the plant from various pathogens due to its capacity to produce an extensive repertoire of antibiotics. At the same time, the plant microbiome is a highly competitive niche, with multiple microbial species competing for space and resources, a competition that can be determined by the antagonistic potential of each microbiome member. Therefore, regulating antibiotic production in the rhizosphere is of great significance to eliminate pathogens and to establish beneficial host-associated communities.\n\nIn this work, we used Bacillus subtilis as a model to investigate the role of plant colonization in antibiotic production. Flow cytometry and Image-stream cytometry analysis supported the notion that A. thaliana specifically induced the transcription of the biosynthetic clusters for the non-ribosomal peptides surfactin, bacilysin and plipastatin and the polyketide bacillaene. This induction could be beneficial for the root as all clusters were shown to antagonize plant pathogens. Consistently, the root failed to induce PenP, a {beta}-lactamase that increases only the fitness of the bacteria. Our results can be translated to improve the performance and competitiveness of beneficial members of the plant microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Humanized mouse models are based on the engraftment of human cells in immunodeficient mouse strains, most notably the NSG strain. Most used models have a major limitation in common, the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD not only introduces variabilities into the research data but also leads to animal welfare concerns. A new mouse strain, B6.129S-Rag2tm1Fwa CD47tm1Fpl Il2rgtm1Wjl/J which lacks Rag1, IL2rg, and CD47 (triple knockout or TKO), is resistant to GVHD development. We transplanted TKO mice with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to establish a new humanized PBMC (hu-PBMC) mouse model. A cohort of these mice was infected with HIV-1 and monitored for plasma HIV viremia and CD4+ T cell depletion. The onset and progression of GVHD were monitored by clinical signs. This study demonstrates that TKO mice transplanted with human PBMCs support engraftment of human immune cells in primary and secondary lymphoid tissues, rectum, and brain. Moreover, the TKO hu-PBMC model supports HIV-1 infection via intraperitoneal, rectal, or vaginal routes, as confirmed by robust plasma HIV viremia and CD4+ T cell depletion. Lastly, TKO mice showed a delayed onset of GVHD clinical signs ([~]21 days) and exhibited significant decreases in plasma levels of TNF{beta}. Based on these results, the TKO hu-PBMC mouse model not only supports humanization and HIV-1 infection but is also resistant to GVHD development, making this model a valuable tool in HIV research.\n\nImportanceCurrently, there is no cure or vaccine for HIV infection, thus continued research is needed to end the HIV pandemic. While many animal models are used in HIV research, none is used more than the humanized mouse model. A major limitation with current humanized mouse models is the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Here, we show a novel humanized mouse model that is resistant to GVHD development and supports and models HIV infection comparable to well-established humanized mouse models.",

Our previous characterizations of Arabidopsis H3K4 demethylases suggest roles for H3K4me1 in transcription. However, the control of H3K4me1 remains unexplored in Arabidopsis, in which no methylase for H3K4me1 has been identified. Here, we identified three Arabidopsis methylases that direct H3K4me1. Analyses of their genome-wide localization using ChIP-seq and machine learning revealed that one of the enzymes cooperates with the transcription machinery, while the other two are associated with specific histone modifications and DNA sequences. Importantly, these two types of localization patterns are also found for the other H3K4 methylases in Arabidopsis and mice. These results suggest that H3K4me1/2/3 are established and maintained via interplay with transcription as well as inputs from other chromatin features, presumably enabling elaborate gene control.",

    "abstract": "Methionine 1 (M1)-linked ubiquitination plays a key role in the regulation of inflammatory nuclear factor-{kappa}B (NF-{kappa}B) signalling and is important for clearance of pathogen infection in Drosophila melanogaster. M1-linked ubiquitin (M1-Ub) chains are assembled by the linear ubiquitin E3 ligase (LUBEL) in flies. Here, we have studied the role of LUBEL in sterile inflammation induced by different types of cellular stresses. We have found that LUBEL catalyses formation of M1-Ub chains in response to hypoxic, oxidative and mechanical stress conditions. LUBEL is shown to be important for flies to survive low oxygen conditions and paraquat-induced oxidative stress. This protective action seems to be driven by stress-induced activation of the NF-{kappa}B transcription factor Relish via the Immune deficiency (Imd) pathway. In addition to LUBEL, the intracellular mediators of Relish activation, including the Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) Diap2, the I{kappa}B kinase {gamma} (IKK{gamma}) Kenny and the initiator caspase Death-related ced-3/Nedd2-like protein (Dredd), but not the membrane receptor peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP)-LC, are shown to be required for sterile inflammatory response and survival. Finally, we showed that the stress-induced upregulation of M1-Ub chains in response to hypoxia, oxidative and mechanical stress is also induced in mammalian cells. Taken together, our results suggest that M1-Ub chains are important for NF-{kappa}B signalling in inflammation induced by stress conditions often observed in chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer.",

We and others have previously used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to identify genetic factors influencing the sensitivity and resistance to cisplatin. In this study, we take advantage of C. elegans to explore cisplatin effects on mitochondrial functions and investigate cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity through a high-resolution semi-automated system for evaluating locomotion. Firstly, we report that a high-glucose diet sensitizes C. elegans to cisplatin at the physiological level and that mitochondrial CED-13 protects the cell from cisplatin-induced oxidative stress. Additionally, by assessing mitochondrial function with a Seahorse Analyzer, we observed a detrimental additive effect of cisplatin and glucose in mitochondrial respiration. Secondly, since we previously found that catechol-O-methyltransferases (involved in dopamine degradation) were upregulated upon cisplatin exposure, we studied the protective role of the FDA-approved drug dopamine against cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity. To implement the use of the Tierpsy Tracker system for measuring neurotoxicity in C. elegans, we showed that abnormal displacements and body postures in cat-2 mutants, which have the dopamine synthesis pathway disrupted, can be rescued by adding dopamine. Then, we used such a system to demonstrate that dopamine treatment protects from the dose-dependent neurotoxicity caused by cisplatin.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWolbachia wMel is the most used strain in mosquito rear and release strategies that aim to inhibit the transmission of arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, Chikungunya and yellow fever. However, the long-term establishment of wMel in natural populations of the dengue mosquito Aedes aegypti raises concerns that interactions between Wolbachia wMel and Ae. aegypti may lead to changes in the host genome, which could affect useful attributes of Wolbachia that allow it to invade and suppress disease transmission.\n\nResultsWe applied an evolve-and-resequence approach to study genome-wide genetic changes in Ae. aegypti from the Cairns region, Australia, where Wolbachia wMel was first introduced more than 10 years ago. Mosquito samples were collected at three different time points in Gordonvale, Australia, covering the phase before (2010) and after (2013 and 2018) Wolbachia releases. An additional three locations where Wolbachia replacement happened at different times across the last decade were also sampled in 2018. We found that the genomes of mosquito populations mostly remained stable after Wolbachia release, with population differences tending to reflect the geographic location of the populations rather than Wolbachia infection status. However, outlier analysis suggests that Wolbachia may have had an influence on some genes related to immune response, development, recognition and behavior.\n\nConclusionsAedes aegypti populations remained geographically distinct after Wolbachia releases in North Australia despite their Wolbachia infection status. At some specific genomic loci, we found signs of selection associated with Wolbachia, suggesting potential evolutionary impacts can happen in the future and further monitoring is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Gasdermins are a family of pore-forming proteins controlling an inflammatory cell death reaction in the mammalian immune system. The pore-forming ability of the gasdermin proteins is released by proteolytic cleavage with the removal of their inhibitory C-terminal domain. Recently, gasdermin-like proteins have been discovered in fungi and characterized as cell death-inducing toxins in the context of conspecific non-self discrimination (allorecognition). Although functional analogies have been established between mammalian and fungal gasdermins, the molecular pathways regulating gasdermin activity in fungi remain largely unknown. Here, we characterize a gasdermin-based cell death reaction, controlled by the het-Q allorecognition genes in the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina. We show that the cytotoxic activity of the HET-Q1 gasdermin is controlled by proteolysis. HET-Q1 loses a [~]5 kDa C-terminal fragment during the cell death reaction in presence of a subtilisin-like serine protease, termed HET-Q2. Mutational analyses and successful reconstitution of the cell death reaction in a heterologous host (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) suggest that HET-Q2 directly cleaves HET-Q1 to induce cell death. By analysing the genomic landscape of het-Q1 homologs in fungi, we uncovered that the vast majority of the gasdermin genes are clustered with protease-encoding genes. These HET-Q2-like proteins carry either subtilisin-like or caspase-related proteases, which in some cases correspond to the N-terminal effector domain of NOD-like receptor proteins (NLRs). This study thus reveals the proteolytic regulation of gasdermins in fungi and establishes evolutionary parallels between fungal and mammalian gasdermin-dependent cell death pathways.\n\nSignificanceThe recent discovery of gasdermin-like proteins in fungi have brought to light that this family of pore-forming proteins controls cell death in two of the major eukaryotic kingdoms, fungi and mammals. Yet, the regulation of cytotoxicity of the fungal gasdermins and their molecular pathways remain uncharacterized. Here, we describe the regulation through proteolytic cleavage of the fungal gasdermin HET-Q1 and uncover that majority of fungal gasdermins are genomically clustered with protease-encoding genes. Some of these genes encode proteins with caspase-related domains and/or are members of a family of immune receptors in mammals and plants. Overall, this work contributes towards our understanding of the evolution of gasdermin-dependent cell death, enlightening multiple evolutionary parallels between signaling pathways in mammals and fungi.",

    "abstract": "A central challenge of quantitative genetics is partitioning phenotypic variation into genetic and non-genetic components. These non-genetic components are usually interpreted as environmental effects; however, variation between genetically identical individuals in a common environment can still exhibit phenotypic variation. A traits resistance to variation is called robustness, though the genetics underlying it are poorly understood. Accordingly, we performed an association study on a previously studied, whole organism trait: robustness for flight performance. Using 197 of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines, we surveyed variation across single nucleotide polymorphisms, whole genes, and epistatic interactions to find genetic modifiers robustness for flight performance. There was an abundance of genes involved in the development of sensory organs and processing of external stimuli, supporting previous work that processing proprioceptive cues is important for affecting variation in flight performance. Additionally, we tested insertional mutants for their effect on robustness using candidate genes found to modify flight performance. These results suggest several genes involved in modulating a trait mean are also important for affecting trait variance, or robustness, as well.\n\nArticle SummaryWe sought to understand the genetic architecture of robustness (variation in a trait caused by non-genetic factors) for flight performance. We used 197 Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines to find significant individual variants and pairs of epistatic interactions, many of which were involved in proprioception. Additionally, we validated significant genes identified from a prior study for the mean of flight performance, showing genes affecting trait means may also affect trait robustness.",

    "abstract": "The liver has the remarkable capacity to regenerate. In the clinic, this capacity can be induced by portal vein embolization (PVE), which redirects portal blood flow resulting in liver hypertrophy in locations with increased blood supply, and atrophy of embolized segments. Here we apply single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomics on healthy, hypertrophied, and atrophied patient-derived liver samples to explore cell states in the liver during regeneration. We first establish an atlas of cell subtypes from the healthy human liver using fresh and frozen tissues, and then compare post-PVE samples with their reference counterparts. We find that PVE alters portal-central zonation of hepatocytes and endothelial cells. Embolization upregulates expression programs associated with development, cellular adhesion and inflammation across cell types. Analysis of interlineage crosstalk revealed key roles for immune cells in modulating regenerating tissue responses.

    "abstract": "Compared to mammals, some fish exhibit indeterminate growth characteristics, meaning they can continue growing throughout their lives. Zebrafish trunk skeletal muscle can in general be classified into slow, intermediate, and fast based on morphological and physiological characteristics. After hatching, hyperplasia can be observed in the muscles of juvenile zebrafish, and with growth, hyperplasia in the fast muscles gradually decreases until it stagnates, after which fast muscle development relies on hypertrophy. In slow muscle, hyperplasia continues throughout life. Teleost muscle structure and growth has been described mainly by morphological and physiological features based on the expression of a limited number of proteins, transcripts, and metabolites. The details of mechanism remain unclear. Visium Spatial Gene Expression solution was used in this study. On the adult slide, 10 clusters were obtained based on whole gene expression similarities. The spatial expression of myosin heave chains, myosin light chains and myosin-binding proteins was investigated. GO enrichment analysis was also performed on different muscle regions of aged zebrafish. Dorsal and ventral slow muscles share the same processes such as myofibril assembly and muscle tissue development. On the larvae slide, 3 clusters were obtained, GO enrichment analysis suggest active muscle formation in zebrafish larvae.",

Moreover, high-throughput structure-based drug discovery has not yet been exploited for membrane proteins due to lack of automation. Here, we present a facile and versatile platform for in meso membrane protein crystallization, enabling rapid atomic structure determination at both cryogenic and room temperature and in a single support. We apply this approach to two human integral membrane proteins, which allowed us to capture different conformational states of intramembrane enzyme-product complexes and analyze the structural dynamics of the ADIPOR2 integral membrane protein. Finally, we demonstrate an automated pipeline combining high-throughput microcrystal soaking, automated laser-based harvesting and serial crystallography enabling screening of small molecule libraries with membrane protein crystals grown in meso.

While numerous bioinformatics tools now exist that predict which variants in the human exome cause diseases, few tools predict the reasons why they might do so. Yet, understanding the impact of variants at the molecular level is a prerequisite for the rational development of targeted drugs or personalized therapies.\n\nResultsWe present the updated MutaFrame webserver, which aims to meet this need. It offers two deleteriousness prediction softwares, DEOGEN2 and SNPMuSiC, and is designed for bioinformaticians and medical researchers who want to gain insights into the origins of monogenic diseases. It contains information at two levels for each human protein: its amino acid sequence and its 3-dimensional structure; we used the experimental structures whenever available, and modeled structures otherwise. MutaFrame also includes higher-level information, such as protein essentiality and protein-protein interactions. It has a user-friendly interface for the interpretation of results and a convenient visualization system for protein structures, in which the variant positions introduced by the user and other structural information are shown. In this way, MutaFrame aids our understanding of the pathogenic processes caused by single-site mutations and their molecular and contextual interpretation.\n\nAvailabilityMutaframe webserver at http://mutaframe.com",

Pol{theta} is the only vertebrate polymerase that encodes an N-terminal superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase domain, but the role of this helicase domain in TMEJ remains unclear. Using single-molecule imaging, we demonstrate that Pol{theta}-helicase (Pol{theta}-h) is a highly processive single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) motor protein that can efficiently strip Replication Protein A (RPA) from ssDNA. Pol{theta}-h also has a limited capacity for disassembling RAD51 filaments but is not processive on doublestranded DNA. Pol{theta}-h can bridge two non-complementary DNA strands in trans. PARylation of Pol{theta}-h by PARP-1 resolves these DNA bridges. We conclude that Pol{theta}-h removes RPA and RAD51 filaments and mediates bridging of DNA overhangs to aid in polymerization by the Pol{theta} polymerase domain.",

Currently, there is no specific inhibitor of AR-V7, while the molecular mechanisms regulating its biological function are not well elucidated. Here we report that AR-V7 has unique biological features that functionally differentiate it from canonical AR-fl or from the second most prevalent variant, AR-v567. First, AR-V7 exhibits fast nuclear import kinetics via a pathway distinct from the nuclear localization signal dependent importin- /{beta} pathway used by AR-fl and AR-v567. We also show that the dimerization box domain, known to mediate AR dimerization and transactivation, is required for AR-V7 nuclear import but not for AR-fl. Once in the nucleus, AR-V7 is transcriptionally active, yet exhibits unusually high intranuclear mobility and transient chromatin interactions, unlike the stable chromatin association of liganded AR-fl. The high intranuclear mobility of AR-V7 together with its high transcriptional output, suggest a Hit-and-Run mode of transcription. Our findings reveal unique mechanisms regulating AR-V7 activity, offering the opportunity to develop selective therapeutic interventions.",

Especially the stem members of the living clades are poorly known, resulting in blurry concepts of the early clade evolution and imprecise estimates of divergence ages. Here, we describe new ophiuroid fossil from the Lower Jurassic of France, Luxembourg, and Austria and introduce the new taxa Ophiogojira labadiei gen. et sp. nov. from lower Pliensbachian shallow sublittoral deposits, Ophiogojira andreui gen. et sp. nov. from lower Toarcian shallow sublittoral deposits, and Ophioduplantiera noctiluca gen. et sp. nov. from late Sinemurian to lower Pliensbachian bathyal deposits. A Bayesian morphological phylogenetic analysis shows that Ophiogojira holds a basal position within the order Ophiurida, whereas Ophioduplantiera has a more crownward position within the ophiurid family Ophiuridae. The position of Ophioduplantiera in the evolutionary tree suggests that family-level divergences within the Ophiurida must have occurred before the late Sinemurian, and that ancient slope environments played an important role in fostering early clade evolution.",

    "abstract": "Plants adapt to adverse environments by turning on defense against abiotic stresses, which is mainly orchestrated by the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). But how ABA homeostasis is modulated to balance growth and stress responses is still largely unknown. Here we report that prior treatment of Arabidopsis seedling with high copper retardates growth but enhances draught tolerance at later stages by modulating ABA accumulation. Subsequent genetic, physiological, transcriptomic, and molecular investigations revealed that the copper responsive transcription factor SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 7 (SPL7) is a strong regulator of ABA accumulation. We showed that SPL7 is destabilized by high copper and consistently suppresses genes encoding three key oxygenases in the ABA biosynthetic pathway of land plants via binding to the GTAC copper response motifs in their promoters. These results revealed a new mechanism whereby copper availability, inversely reflected by SPL7 abundance, modulates de novo ABA biosynthesis to balance growth and drought tolerance.\n\nOne-sentence summaryHigh copper availability represses SPL7, releasing its suppression on key ABA biosynthetic genes and leading to increased ABA accumulation that inhibits growth but enhances drought tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades transmit environmental signals and induce stress and defence responses in plants. These signalling cascades are negatively controlled by specific phosphatases of the type 2C Ser/Thr protein phosphatase (PP2C) and dual-specificity phosphatase (DSP) families that inactivate stress-induced MAPKs; however, the interplay between phosphatases of these different types has remained unknown. Our work reveals that different Arabidopsis MAPK phosphatases, the PP2C-type AP2C1 and the DSP-type MKP1, exhibit both specific and overlapping functions in plant stress responses. Each single mutant and ap2c1 mkp1 double mutant displayed enhanced wound-induced activation of MAPKs MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6, as well as induction of a set of transcription factors. Moreover, ap2c1 mkp1 double mutants show an autoimmune-like response, associated with elevated levels the stress hormones salicylic acid and ethylene, and of the phytoalexin camalexin. Interestingly, this phenotype is reduced in ap2c1 mkp1 mpk6 triple mutants, suggesting that the autoimmune-like response is due to MPK6 misregulation. We conclude that the evolutionarily distant MAPK phosphatases AP2C1 and MKP1 contribute crucially to the tight control of MPK6 activity, ensuring appropriately balanced stress signalling and suppression of autoimmune-like responses during plant growth and development.\n\nHighlightDouble MAPK phosphatase mutant plants ap2c1 mkp1 exhibit constitutive, autoimmune-like stress responses, dependent on their substrate MAPK MPK6.",

Accurate model calibration relies, in turn, on data, and on how well-suited the available data is to a particular modelling task. Optimal experimental design (OED) techniques can be used to identify experiments and data collection procedures that will most efficiently contribute to a given modelling objective. However, implementation of OED is limited by currently available software tools that are not well-suited for the diversity of nonlinear models and non-normal data commonly encountered in biological research. Moreover, existing OED tools do not make use of the state-of-the-art numerical tools, resulting in inefficient computation.\n\nResultsHere we present the NLoed software package. NLoed is an open-source Python library providing convenient access to OED methods, with particular emphasis on experimental design for systems biology research. NLoed supports a wide variety of nonlinear, multi-input/output, and dynamic models, and facilitates modelling and design of experiments over a wide variety of data types. To support OED investigations, the NLoed package implements maximum likelihood fitting and diagnostic tools, providing a comprehensive modelling workflow. NLoed offers an accessible, modular, and flexible OED tool-set suited to the wide variety of experimental scenarios encountered in systems biology research. We demonstrate NLOEDs capabilities by applying it to experimental design for characterization of a bacterial optogenetic system.\n\nAvailabilityNLoed is available via pip from the PyPi repository; https://pypi.org/project/nloed/.

    "abstract": "Non-invasive assessment of axon radii via MRI bears great potential for clinical and neuroscience research as it is a main determinant of the neuronal conduction velocity. However, there is a lack of representative histological reference data on the scale of the cross-section of MRI voxels for validating the MRI-visible, effective radius (reff). Because the current gold standard stems from neuroanatomical studies designed to estimate the frequency-weighted arithmetic mean radius (rarith) on small ensembles of axons, it is unsuited to estimate the tail-weighted reff. We propose CNN-based segmentation on high-resolution, large-scale light microscopy (lsLM) data to generate a representative reference for reff. In a human corpus callosum, we assessed estimation accuracy and bias of rarith and reff. Furthermore, we investigated whether mapping anatomy-related variation of rarith and reff is confounded by low-frequency variation of the image intensity, e.g., due to staining heterogeneity. Finally, we analyzed the potential error due to outstandingly large axons in reff. Compared to rarith, reff was estimated with higher accuracy (normalized-root-mean-square-error of reff: 7.2 %; rarith: 21.5 %) and lower bias (normalized-mean-bias-error of reff: -1.7 %; rarith: 16 %). While rarith was confounded by variation of the image intensity, variation of reff seemed anatomy-related. The largest axons contributed between 0.9 % and 3 % to reff. In conclusion, the proposed method accurately estimates reff at MRI voxel resolution across a human corpus callosum sample. Further investigations are required to assess generalization to brain areas with different axon radii ensembles.",

    "abstract": "Our knowledge about objects in our environment reflects an integration of current visual input with information from preceding gaze fixations. Such a mechanism may reduce uncertainty, but requires the visual system to determine which information obtained in different fixations should be combined or kept separate. To investigate the basis of this decision, we conducted three experiments. Participants viewed a stimulus in their peripheral vision, then made a saccade that shifted the object into the opposite hemifield. During the saccade, the object underwent changes of varying magnitude in two feature dimensions (Experiment 1: color and location, Experiments 2 and 3: color and orientation). Participants reported whether they detected any change and estimated one of the post-saccadic features. Integration of pre-saccadic with post-saccadic input was observed as a bias in estimates towards the pre-saccadic feature value. In all experiments, pre-saccadic bias weakened as the magnitude of the transsaccadic change in the estimated feature increased. Changes in the other feature, despite having a similar probability of detection, had no effect on integration. Results were quantitatively captured by an observer model where the decision whether to integrate information from sequential fixations is made independently for each feature and coupled to awareness of a feature change.",

    "abstract": "Latent variable models are ubiquitous in the exploratory analysis of neural population recordings, where they allow researchers to summarize the activity of large populations of neurons in lower dimensional  latent spaces. Existing methods can generally be categorized into (i) Bayesian methods that facilitate flexible incorporation of prior knowledge and uncertainty estimation, but which typically do not scale to large datasets; and (ii) highly parameterized methods without explicit priors that scale better but often struggle in the low-data regime. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a fully Bayesian yet scalable version of Gaussian process factor analysis (bGPFA), which models neural data as arising from a set of inferred latent processes with a prior that encourages smoothness over time. Additionally, bGPFA uses automatic relevance determination to infer the dimensionality of neural activity directly from the training data during optimization. To enable the analysis of continuous recordings without trial structure, we introduce a novel variational inference strategy that scales near-linearly in time and also allows for non-Gaussian noise models appropriate for electrophysiological recordings. We apply bGPFA to continuous recordings spanning 30 minutes with over 14 million data points from primate motor and somatosensory cortices during a self-paced reaching task. We show that neural activity progresses from an initial state at target onset to a reach-specific preparatory state well before movement onset. The distance between these initial and preparatory latent states is predictive of reaction times across reaches, suggesting that such preparatory dynamics have behavioral relevance despite the lack of externally imposed delay periods. Additionally, bGPFA discovers latent processes that evolve over slow timescales on the order of several seconds and contain complementary information about reaction time. These timescales are longer than those revealed by methods which focus on individual movement epochs and may reflect fluctuations in e.g. task engagement.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that musical deviants (syntactically irregular chords) elicit event related potentials/fields with negative polarity; specifically, the early right anterior negativity and the right anterior temporal negativity responses with peak latencies at ~200 ms and ~350 ms, respectively, post stimulus onset. Here, we investigated differences in the neural dynamics of the auditory perceptual system of individuals with music training compared to those with no music training. Magnetoencephalography was used to examine the neural response to a deviant sound when the auditory system was primed using stimulus entrainment to evoke an auditory gamma-band response between 31 Hz and 39 Hz, in 2 Hz steps. Participants responded to the harmonic relationship between the entrainment stimulus and the subsequent target stimulus. Gamma frequencies carry stimulus information; thus, the paradigm primed the auditory system with a known gamma frequency and evaluated any improvement in the brains response to a deviant stimulus. The entrainment stimuli did not elicit an early right anterior negativity response. Furthermore, the source location of the event-related field difference during the later right anterior temporal negativity response time-window varied depending on group and entrainment condition. In support of previous findings from research using this, and a functionally similar visual-priming paradigm, a 7 Hz phase modulation of gamma amplitude was found for non-musicians following 33 Hz stimulus entrainment. Overall, significant effects of gamma entrainment were found more frequently in the non-music brain. By contrast, musicians demonstrated a greater range of interactions with slower brain rhythms, indicative of increased top-down control.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=130 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/446932v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (49K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1097a58org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13f3c74org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@99fae1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@125d351_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG ConclusionO_LIMusicians auditory cognition relies more on top-down processes, while non-musicians rely on bottom-up processing, and therefore, their auditory cognition is facilitated by the entrained gamma-band response.\nC_LIO_LIFirst neural evidence in support of faster reaction-time responses due to an interaction in phase of an entrained gamma-band response of 33 Hz and a slower endogenous theta rhythm (~7 Hz) - consistently reported in previous research.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Single-brain neuroimaging studies have shown that human cooperation is associated with neural activity in frontal and temporoparietal regions. However, it remains unclear whether single-brain studies are informative about cooperation in real life, where people interact dynamically. Such dynamic interactions have become the focus of inter-brain studies. An advantageous technique in this regard is functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) because it is less susceptible to movement artifacts than more conventional techniques like EEG or fMRI. We conducted a systematic review and the first quantitative meta-analysis of fNIRS hyperscanning of cooperation, based on thirteen studies with 890 participants. Overall, the meta-analysis revealed evidence of statistically significant inter-brain synchrony while people were cooperating, with large overall effect sizes in both frontal and temporoparietal areas. All thirteen studies observed significant inter-brain synchrony in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), suggesting that this region is particularly relevant for cooperative behavior. The consistency in these findings is unlikely to be due to task-related activations, given that the relevant studies used diverse cooperation tasks. Together, the present findings support the importance of inter-brain synchronization of frontal and temporoparietal regions in interpersonal cooperation. Moreover, the present article highlights the usefulness of meta-analyses as a tool for discerning patterns in inter-brain dynamics.",

The molecular mechanisms that determine the timing and rate of differentiation however are not defined. Here we show that the RNA binding proteins (RBP) ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 limit the rate of differentiation of activated naive CD8+ T cells and the potency of the resulting cytotoxic lymphocytes. The RBP act in an early and short temporal window to enforce dependency on costimulation via CD28 for full T cell activation and effector differentiation by directly binding mRNA of NF-B, IRF8 and NOTCH1 transcription factors and cytokines, including IL2. Their absence in T cells, or the adoptive transfer of a small numbers of CD8+ T cells lacking the RBP, promotes resilience to influenza A virus infection without immunopathology. These findings highlight ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 as nodes for the integration of the early T cell activation signals determining the speed and quality of the CD8 response.",

    "abstract": "Global climate change is gradually changing species distribution and their patterns of diversity. Yet, factors that influence the local distribution and habitat preferences for southern African species remain largely unexplored. Here, we computed the suitable habitats in the southern African region for Colophospermum mopane (Benth.) using the maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling approach. We utilized one Global Circulation Model (GCM) and three Representative concentration pathways (RCPs) to determine the current and future distribution of C. mopane. The results showed that the distribution of C. mopane was mainly influenced by solar radiation, annual temperature range, and annual precipitation. According to the species response curves, this species preferred habitats with annual precipitation of 130-200 mm, an annual temperature range of 28{degrees} C, and elevations of about 500 m above sea level. The results highlight that the geographic range of C. mopane is likely to expand along the borders of Zambia and Zimbabwe in the future, particularly in the miombo plains. Conversely, suitable habitat areas reduce significantly in the eastern area of the southern African region, while the western areas expand. Overall, the appropriate habitat areas will likely decline in the 2050s under both RCPs and expand in the 2070s under the two scenarios. This knowledge is important for landscape planners and rangeland managers working to safeguard biodiversity from extinction.\n\nHighlightsO_LIHigh reliability of models in habitat suitability modelling for C. mopane\nC_LIO_LISolar radiation is the most significant variable for the current distribution of mopane.\nC_LIO_LIClimate change is and will reduce the habitat suitability of our target species.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The Amazon is probably the most diverse realm on Earth, and is considered to be the primary source of diversity and a center of dispersal for Neotropical terrestrial organisms. Yet, the assumption that the Amazon basin is a primordial place of fish species origination and dispersal into other drainages still need to be tested. We addressed this issue by inferring a time-stratified biogeographic history and reconstructing the ancestral habitat preference of Hypostomus, a continentally widespread and species-rich Neotropical genus. We found that Hypostomus emerged in the Western Amazon ([~]14.7 Ma), when the Western Amazon River was flowing northwards and disconnected from the Eastern Amazon. We show that dispersal events in the first half of Hypostomus evolution occurred from the Western Amazon into adjacent basins, initiating its Neotropical radiation. The ancestral preferred habitat consisted in small rivers with running waters, a predominant habitat in river headwaters. Because of strong niche conservatism in the early evolution of Hypostomus, we suggest that most of the out-of-Western-Amazon dispersal occurred via headwater captures. The radiation of Hypostomus was further promoted by major reconfigurations of river basins, which opened dispersal opportunities into new drainages. Diversification in habitat preference coincided with colonization of basins already occupied by congenerics, indicative of niche shifts triggered by inter-specific competition and species coexistence. By analyzing the evolutionary history of Hypostomus, we show that Western Amazon was the main center of fish dispersal in the Neotropical Region from Middle Miocene to the present, supporting the cradle hypothesis of fish origination and dispersal.",

    "abstract": "Posttranscriptional tRNA modifications are essential for proper gene expression, and defects in the enzymes that perform tRNA modifications are associated with numerous human disorders. Throughout eukaryotes, 2-O-methylation of residues 32 and 34 of the anticodon loop of tRNA is important for proper translation, and in humans, lack of these modifications results in non-syndromic X-linked intellectual disability. In yeast, the methyltransferase Trm7 forms a complex with Trm732 to 2-O-methylate tRNA residue 32 and with Trm734 to 2-O-methylate tRNA residue 34. Trm732 and Trm734 are required for the methylation activity of Trm7, but the role of these auxiliary proteins is not clear. Additionally, Trm732 and Trm734 homologs are implicated in biological processes not directly related to translation, suggesting that these proteins may have additional cellular functions. To identify critical amino acids in Trm732, we generated variants and tested their ability to function in yeast cells. We identified a conserved RRSAGLP motif in the conserved DUF2428 domain of Trm732 that is required for tRNA modification activity by both yeast Trm732 and its human homolog THADA. The identification of Trm732 variants that lack tRNA modification activity will help to determine if other biological functions ascribed to Trm732 and THADA are directly due to tRNA modification, or to secondary effects due to other functions of these proteins.",

    "abstract": "The fatty acid composition of seed oil is a major determinant of the flavor, shelf-life, and nutritional quality of peanuts. Major QTLs controlling high oil content, high oleic content, and low linoleic content have been characterized in several seed oil crop species. Here we employ genome-wide association approaches on a recently genotyped collection of 787 plant introduction accessions in the USDA peanut core collection, plus selected improved cultivars, to discover markers associated with the natural variation in fatty acid composition, and to explain the genetic control of fatty acid composition in seed oils.\n\nOverall, 251 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) had significant trait associations with the measured fatty acid components. Twelve SNPs were associated with two or three different traits. Of these loci with apparent pleiotropic effects, 10 were associated with both oleic (C18:1) and linoleic acid (C18:2) content at different positions in the genome. In all 10 cases, the favorable allele had an opposite effect - increasing and lowering the concentration, respectively, of oleic and linoleic acid. The other traits with pleiotropic variant control were palmitic (C16:0), behenic (C22:0), lignoceric (C24:0), gadoleic (C20:1), total saturated, and total unsaturated fatty acid content. One hundred (100) of the significantly associated SNPs were located within 1000 kbp of 55 genes with fatty acid biosynthesis functional annotations. These genes encoded, among others: ACCase carboxyl transferase subunits, and several fatty acid synthase II enzymes.\n\nWith the exception of gadoleic (C20:1) and lignoceric (C24:0) acid content, which occur at relatively low abundance in cultivated peanut, all traits had significant SNP interactions exceeding a stringent Bonferroni threshold ( = 1%). We detected 7,682 pairwise SNP interactions affecting the relative abundance of fatty acid components in the seed oil. Of these, 627 SNP pairs had at least one SNP within 1000 kbp of a gene with fatty acid biosynthesis functional annotation. We evaluated 168 candidate genes underlying these SNP interactions. Functional enrichment and protein-to-protein interactions supported significant interactions (p- value < 1.0E-16) among the genes evaluated. These results show the complex nature of the biology and genes underlying the variation in seed oil fatty acid composition and contribute to an improved genotype-to-phenotype map for fatty acid variation in peanut seed oil.\n\nKey phrasesSNP Genotyping, Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS), GWAS of interacting SNPs (GWASi), Pleiotropy, Seed fatty acid composition, Oleic-Linoleic acid ratio.",

During a dynamic process such as cellular differentiation, the overall cell type composition of a tissue (or an in vitro culture) and the gene regulatory profile of each cell can both experience significant changes over time. To identify these dynamic effects in high resolution, we collected single-cell RNA-sequencing data over a differentiation time course from induced pluripotent stem cells to cardiomyocytes, sampled at 7 unique time points in 19 human cell lines. We employed a flexible approach to map dynamic eQTLs whose effects vary significantly over the course of bifurcating differentiation trajectories, including many whose effects are specific to one of these two lineages. Our study design allowed us to distinguish true dynamic eQTLs affecting a specific cell lineage from expression changes driven by potentially non-genetic differences between cell lines such as cell composition. Additionally, we used the cell type profiles learned from single-cell data to deconvolve and re-analyze data from matched bulk RNA-seq samples. Using this approach, we were able to identify a large number of novel dynamic eQTLs in single cell data while also attributing dynamic effects in bulk to a particular lineage. Overall, we found that using single cell data to uncover dynamic eQTLs can provide new insight into the gene regulatory changes that occur among heterogeneous cell types during cardiomyocyte differentiation.",

Despite the recent structural determination of the transmembrane domains of human Scap and Insig-2 bound to 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), the structure and regulatory mechanism of the luminal domains of Scap by cholesterol remains elusive. Here, combining cryo-EM analysis and artificial intelligence-facilitated structural prediction, we report the structure of the human Scap/Insig-2 complex in the presence of digitonin instead of 25HC. Despite the lack of sequence similarity, the structure of the luminal domain Loop 1 and a co-folded segment in Loop 7 of Scap resembles that of the luminal/extracellular domain in NPC1 and related proteins. Comparison of the sterol-loaded structures of these proteins provides clues of the regulation of Loop 1/7 interaction by cholesterol. We also show that the structure of Scap(D428A), which suppresses SREBP activation under sterol depletion, is identical to WT when complexed with Insig-2, although the gain of function may also involve a later step in protein trafficking.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pyogenes, or Group A Streptococcus, is a Gram-positive bacterium that can be both a human commensal and pathogen. Central to this dichotomy are temperate bacteriophages that incorporate into the bacterial genome as a prophage. These genetic elements encode both the phage proteins as well as toxins harmful to the human host. One such conserved phage protein paratox (Prx) is always found encoded adjacent to the toxin genes and this linkage is preserved during transduction. Within Streptococcus pyogenes, Prx functions to inhibit the quorum-sensing ComRS receptor-signal pair that is the master regulator of natural competence, or the ability to uptake endogenous DNA. Specifically, Prx directly binds and inhibits the receptor ComR by unknown mechanism. To understand how Prx inhibits ComR at the molecular level we pursued an X-ray crystal structure of Prx bound to ComR. The structural data supported by solution X-ray scattering data demonstrate that Prx induces a conformational change in ComR to directly access the DNA binding domain. Furthermore, electromobility shift assays and competition binding assays reveal that Prx effectively uncouples the inter-domain conformational change that is required for activation of ComR by the signaling molecule XIP. Although to our knowledge the molecular mechanism of quorum-sensing inhibition by Prx is unique, it is analogous to the mechanism employed by the phage protein Aqs1 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Together, this demonstrates an example of convergent evolution between Gram-positive and Gram-negative phages to inhibit quorum-sensing, and highlights the versatility of small phage proteins.",

    "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of human membrane proteins and represent the primary targets of about one third of currently marketed drugs. Despite the critical importance, experimental structures have been determined for only a limited portion of GPCRs and functional mechanisms of GPCRs remain poorly understood. Here, we have constructed novel sequence coevolutionary models of the A and B classes of GPCRs and compared them with residue contact frequency maps generated with available experimental structures. Significant portions of structural residue contacts were successfully detected in the sequence-based covariational models. \"Exception\" residue contacts predicted from sequence coevolutionary models but not available structures added missing links that were important for GPCR activation and allosteric modulation. Moreover, we identified distinct residue contacts involving different sets of functional motifs for GPCR activation, such as the Na+ pocket, CWxP, DRY, PIF and NPxxY motifs in the class A and the HETx and PxxG motifs in the class B. Finally, we systematically uncovered critical residue contacts tuned by allosteric modulation in the two classes of GPCRs, including those from the activation motifs and particularly the extracellular and intracellular loops in class A GPCRs. These findings provide a promising framework for rational design of ligands to regulate GPCR activation and allosteric modulation.\n\nSignificanceG-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play key roles in cellular signaling and serve as the primary targets of [~]1/3 of currently marketed drugs. In this work, we have presented the first analysis of both residue sequence coevolution and structural contact maps in different classes of GPCRs. We have inferred pathways for GPCR signal transduction that could not be determined from structural analysis alone. Distinct residue contacts have been identified in the signaling pathways of class A and B GPCRs. Our combined sequence coevolutionary and structural contact analysis has thus revealed important insights into the mechanism of GPCR signal transduction, which is expected to facilitate rational drug design of the GPCRs.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art methods for predicting novel trans RNA-RNA interactions use the so-called accessibility as key concept. It estimates whether a region in a given RNA sequence is accessible for forming trans interactions, using a thermodynamic model which quantifies its secondary structure features. RNA-RNA interactions are then predicted by finding the minimum free energy base-pairing between the two transcripts, taking into account the accessibility as energy penalty.\n\nWe investigated the underlying assumptions of this approach using the two methods RNAO_SCPLOWPLEXC_SCPLOW and IO_SCPLOWNTAC_SCPLOWRNA on two datasets, containing sRNA-mRNA and snoRNA-rRNA interactions, respectively.\n\nWe find that (1) known trans RNA-RNA interactions frequently overlap regions containing RNA structure features, (2) the estimated accessibility reflects sRNA structures fairly well, but often disagrees with structure annotations of longer transcripts, (3) the prediction performance of RNA-RNA interaction prediction methods is independent of the quality of the estimated accessibility profiles, and (4) one important overall effect of accessibility profiles is to prevent the thermodynamic model from predicting too long interactions.\n\nBased on our findings, we conclude that the accessibility concept to the minimum free energy approach to predicting novel RNA-RNA interactions has conceptual limitations and discuss potential ways of improving the field in the future.",

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases in humans appear to be one of the most primary public health issues. Identification of novel disease-associated proteins will furnish an efficient recognition of the novel therapeutic targets. Here, we develop a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based model called PINDeL to identify the disease-associated host proteins by integrating the human Protein Locality Graph and its corresponding topological features. Because of the amalgamation of GCN with the protein interaction network, PINDeL achieves the highest accuracy of 83.45% while AUROC and AUPRC values are 0.90 and 0.88, respectively. With high accuracy, recall, F1-score, specificity, AUROC, and AUPRC, PINDeL outperforms other existing machine-learning and deep-learning techniques for disease gene/protein identification in humans. Application of PINDeL on an independent dataset of 24320 proteins, which are not used for training, validation, or testing purposes, predicts 6448 new disease-protein associations of which we verify 3196 disease-proteins through experimental evidence like disease ontology, Gene Ontology, and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. Our investigation informs that experimentally-verified 748 proteins are indeed responsible for pathogen-host protein interactions of which 22 disease-proteins share their association with multiple diseases such as cancer, aging, chem-dependency, pharmacogenomics, normal variation, infection, and immune-related diseases. This unique Graph Convolution Network-based prediction model is of utmost use in large-scale disease-protein association prediction and hence, will provide crucial insights on disease pathogenesis and will further aid in developing novel therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "As DNA sequencing technologies keep improving in scale and cost, there is a growing need to develop machine learning models to analyze DNA sequences, e.g., to decipher regulatory signals from DNA fragments bound by a particular protein of interest. As a double helix made of two complementary strands, a DNA fragment can be sequenced as two equivalent, so-called Reverse Complement (RC) sequences of nucleotides. To take into account this inherent symmetry of the data in machine learning models can facilitate learning. In this sense, several authors have recently proposed particular RC-equivariant convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, it remains unknown whether other RC-equivariant architectures exist, which could potentially increase the set of basic models adapted to DNA sequences for practitioners. Here, we close this gap by characterizing the set of all linear RC-equivariant layers, and show in particular that new architectures exist beyond the ones already explored. We further discuss RC-equivariant pointwise nonlinearities adapted to different architectures, as well as RC-equivariant embeddings of k-mers as an alternative to one-hot encoding of nucleotides. We show experimentally that the new architectures can outperform existing ones.",

    "abstract": "Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) continues to have a poor prognosis, especially in the elderly. One reason for this is that many treatment regimens are not well tolerated by elderly patients. Much current focus is on the development of therapies that can target specific vulnerabilities of AML while having fewer toxic side effects. However, despite much recent progress in developing better drugs, many patients with AML still die within a year of diagnosis, partly due to the fact that it is difficult to identify therapeutic targets that are effective across multiple AML subtypes. One common factor across AML subtypes is the presence of a block in differentiation. Thus screening for compounds that can overcome this block in genetically diverse AML models should allow for the identification of agents that are not dependent on a specific mutation for their efficacy. Here, we used a phenotypic screen to identify novel compounds that stimulate differentiation in several AML cell lines. Lead compounds were shown to decrease tumour burden and to increase survival in vivo. Using multiple complementary target deconvolution approaches, these compounds were revealed to be anti-mitotic tubulin disruptors that cause differentiation by inducing a G2-M mitotic arrest. Together, these results reveal a novel function for tubulin disruptors in causing differentiation of AML cells.",

Tracking metastatic spread in living patients is difficult, and thus poorly understood.\n\nResultsVia rapid autopsy, we have collected 30 tumor samples over 3 timepoints and across 8 organs from a triple-negative metastatic breast cancer patient. The large number of sites sampled, together with deep whole genome sequencing and advanced computational analysis, allowed us to comprehensively reconstruct the tumors evolution at subclonal resolution. The most unique, previously not reported aspect of the tumors evolution we observed in this patient was the presence of \"subclone incubators\", i.e. already metastatic sites where substantial tumor evolution occurred before colonization of additional sites and organs by subclones that evolved at the incubator site. Overall, we identified four discrete waves of metastatic expansions, each of which resulted in a number of new, genetically similar metastasis sites that also enriched for particular organs (e.g. abdominal vs bone and brain). The lung played a critical role in facilitating metastatic spread in this patient: the lung was the first site of metastatic escape from the primary breast lesion; subclones at this site were the source of all four subsequent metastatic waves; and multiple sites in the lung acted as subclone incubators. Finally, functional annotation revealed that many known driver or metastasis-promoting tumor mutations in this patient were shared by some, but not all metastatic sites, highlighting the need for more comprehensive surveys of a patients metastases for effective clinical intervention.\n\nConclusionsOur analysis revealed the presence of substantial tumor evolution at metastatic incubator sites, with potentially important clinical implications. Our study demonstrated that sampling of a large number of metastatic sites affords unprecedented detail for studying metastatic evolution.",

Given that in predictive coding higher frequencies have been associated with prediction errors, while lower frequencies have been linked to expectations, we tested the hypothesis that alpha-to-beta ERD and gamma ERS induced by aversive pictures are associated with expectations and prediction errors, respectively. We recorded EEG while volunteers were involved in a probabilistically cued affective picture task using three different negative valences to produce expectations and prediction errors. Our data show that alpha-to-beta band activity was related to the expected valence of the stimulus as predicted by a cue. The absolute mismatch of the expected and actual valence, which denotes an absolute prediction error was related to gamma band activity. This demonstrates that top-down predictions and bottom-up prediction errors are represented in specific spectral patterns associated with affective picture processing.",

The development of a TB vaccine that induces durable and effective immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is urgently needed. Early and superior Mtb control can be induced in M. bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinated hosts when the innate immune response is targeted to generate effective vaccine-induced immunity. In the present study, we show that innate activation of DCs is critical for mucosal localization of clonally activated vaccine-induced CD4+ T cells in the lung, and superior early Mtb control. In addition, our study reveals that Th1/Th17 cytokine axis play an important role in superior vaccine induced immunity. Our studies also show that activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF{kappa}{beta}) pathway in lung epithelial cells is critical for the mucosal localization of activated vaccine-induced CD4+ T cells for rapid Mtb control.

Here we have addressed the role of AID in the terminal differentiation of GC B cells by combining single cell transcriptome and immunoglobulin clonal analysis in a mouse model that traces AID-experienced cells. We identified 8 transcriptional clusters that include dark zone and light zone GC subsets, plasmablasts/plasma cells (PB), 4 subsets of MBCs and a novel prePB subset, which shares the strongest clonal relationships with PBs. Mice lacking AID have various alterations in the size and expression profiles of these transcriptional clusters. We find that AID deficiency leads to a reduced proportion of prePB cells and severely impairs transitions between the prePB and the PB subsets.

This modification can result in antibody dysfunction, and development of a custom antibody panel can be very costly and time consuming as trial and error of modified antibodies proceeds. To address these challenges, we developed novel tyramide-conjugated DNA barcodes that can be used with primary antibodies via peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. This approach results in signal amplification and imaging without the need to conjugate primary antibodies.

    "abstract": "Stability of microbial cooperation through common goods is susceptible to cheating. Evidence suggests that cheating plays a less prominent role in many natural systems than hitherto predicted by models of eco-evolutionary dynamics and evolutionary game theory. While several cheater negating factors such as spatial segregation have been identified, most consider single-nutrient regimes. Here we propose a cheater-suppressing mechanism based on previous experimental observations regarding the biochemical trade-off between growth speed and delay in switching to alternative nutrients. As changing the nutrient source requires redistribution of enzymatic resources to different metabolic pathways, the advantage in speed is offset by lower agility due to longer time required for resource re-allocation. Using an in silico model system of sucrose utilisation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we find that a tradeoff between growth rate and diauxic lag duration can supress cheaters under fluctuating nutrient availability and thereby stabilise cooperation. The resulting temporal dynamics constrain cheaters despite their competitive benefit for the growth on the primary nutrient via avoided public goods synthesis costs. We further show that this speed-agility trade-off can function in synergy with spatial segregation to avoid the collapse of the community due to the cheaters. Taken together, the growth-agility trade-off may contribute to cheater suppression in microbial ecosystems experiencing fluctuating environments, such as plant root microbiota and gut microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Inversions often underlie complex adaptive traits, but the genic targets inside them are largely unknown. Gene expression profiling provides a powerful way to link inversions with their phenotypic consequences. We examined the effects of the Cf-Inv(1) inversion in the seaweed fly Coelopa frigida on gene expression variation across sexes and life stages. Our analyses revealed that Cf-Inv(1) shapes global expression patterns but the extent of this effect is variable with much stronger effects in adults than larvae. Furthermore, within adults, both common as well as sex specific patterns were found. The vast majority of these differentially expressed genes mapped to Cf-Inv(1). However, genes that were differentially expressed in a single context (i.e. in males, females or larvae) were more likely to be located outside of Cf-Inv(1). By combining our findings with genomic scans for environmentally associated SNPs, we were able to pinpoint candidate variants in the inversion that may underlie mechanistic pathways that determine phenotypes. Together the results in this study, combined with previous findings, support the notion that the polymorphic Cf-Inv(1) inversion in this species is a major factor shaping both coding and regulatory variation resulting in highly complex adaptive effects.",

    "abstract": "The increasingly widespread availability of genomic data has created a growing need for fast, sensitive and scalable comparative analysis methods. A key aspect of comparative genomic analysis is the study of synteny, co-localized gene clusters shared among genomes due to descent from common ancestors. Synteny can provide unique insight into the origin, function, and evolution of genome architectures, but methods to identify syntenic patterns in genomic datasets are often inflexible and slow, and use diverse definitions of what counts as likely synteny. Moreover, the reliable identification of putatively syntenic regions (i.e., whether they are truly indicative of homology) with different lengths and signal to noise ratios can be difficult to quantify. Here, we present Mology, a fast, flexible, alignment-free, nonparametric method to detect regions of syntenic elements among genomes or other datasets. The core algorithm operates on consecutive, rank-ordered elements, which could be genes, operons, motifs, sequence fragments, or any other orderable element. It is agnostic to the physical distance between distinct elements and also to directionality and order within syntenic regions, although such considerations can be addressed post hoc. We describe the underlying statistical theory behind our analysis method, and employ a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the false positive rate and positive predictive values for putative syntenic regions. We also evaluate how varying amounts of noise affect recovery of true syntenic regions among Saccharomycetaceae yeast genomes with up to ~100 million years of divergence. We discuss different strategies for recursive application of our method on syntenic regions with sparser signal than considered here, as well as the general applicability of the core algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Pigs not only function as a major meat source worldwide but also are commonly used as an animal model for studying human complex traits. A large haplotype reference panel has been used to facilitate efficient phasing and imputation of relatively sparse genome-wide microarray chips and low-coverage sequencing data. Using the imputed genotypes in the downstream analysis, such as GWASs, TWASs, eQTL mapping and genomic prediction (GS), is beneficial for obtaining novel findings. However, currently, there is still a lack of publicly available and high-quality pig reference panels with large sample sizes and high diversity, which greatly limits the application of genotype imputation in pigs. In response, we built the pig Haplotype Reference Panel (PHARP) database. PHARP provides a reference panel of 2,012 pig haplotypes at 34 million SNPs constructed using whole-genome sequence data from more than 49 studies of 71 pig breeds. It also provides Web-based analytical tools that allow researchers to carry out phasing and imputation consistently and efficiently. PHARP is freely accessible at http://alphaindex.zju.edu.cn/PHARP/index.php. We demonstrate its applicability for pig commercial 50K SNP arrays, by accurately imputing 2.6 billion genotypes at a concordance rate value of 0.971 in 81 Large White pigs (~ 17x sequencing coverage). We also applied our reference panel to impute the low-density SNP chip into the high-density data for three GWASs and found novel significantly associated SNPs that might be casual variants.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in implanted device development have enabled chronic streaming of neural data to external devices allowing for long timescale, naturalistic recordings. However, characteristic data losses occur during wireless transmission. Estimates for the duration of these losses are typically uncertain reducing signal quality and impeding analyses. To characterize the effect of these losses on recovery of averaged neural signals, we simulated neural time series data for a typical event-related potential (ERP) experiment. We investigated how the signal duration and the degree of timing uncertainty affected the offset of the ERP, its duration in time, its amplitude, and the ability to resolve small differences corresponding to different task conditions. Simulations showed that long timescale signals were generally robust to the effects of packet losses apart from timing offsets while short timescale signals were significantly delocalized and attenuated. These results provide clarity on the types of signals that can be resolved using these datasets and provide clarity on the restrictions imposed by data losses on typical analyses.",

Cryo-electron microscopy has revealed that the Piezo1 structure is bowl-shaped and capable of inducing membrane curvature via its extended footprint, which indirectly suggest that Piezo1 ion channels may bias each others spatial distribution and interact functionally. Here, we use cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp stimulation to functionally examine large numbers of membrane patches from cells expressing Piezo1 endogenously at low levels and cells overexpressing Piezo1 at high levels. Our data, together with stochastic simulations of Piezo1 spatial distributions, show that both at endogenous densities (1-2 channels/m2), and at non-physiological densities (10-20 channels/m2) predicted to cause substantial footprint overlap, Piezo1 density has no substantial effect on its pressure sensitivity or open probability in the nominal absence of membrane tension. The results suggest that Piezo channels, at densities likely to be physiologically relevant, inherently behave as independent mechanotransducers. We propose this property is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire cell membrane.",

By revealing the molecular basis for the poor or improved incorporation of ncAAs, mechanistic studies of ncAA incorporation by the protein synthesis machinery have tremendous potential for informing and directing such engineering efforts. In this chapter, we describe a set of complementary biochemical and single-molecule fluorescence assays that we have adapted for mechanistic studies of ncAA incorporation.

    "abstract": "Many patients infected with coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and NL63 that use ACE2 receptors to infect cells, exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms and viral proteins are found in the human gastrointestinal tract, yet little is known about the inflammatory and pathological effects of coronavirus infection on the human intestine. Here, we used a human intestine-on-a-chip (Intestine Chip) microfluidic culture device lined by patient organoid-derived intestinal epithelium interfaced with human vascular endothelium to study host cellular and inflammatory responses to infection with NL63 coronavirus. These organoid-derived intestinal epithelial cells dramatically increased their ACE2 protein levels when cultured under flow in the presence of peristalsis-like mechanical deformations in the Intestine Chips compared to when cultured statically as organoids or in Transwell inserts. Infection of the intestinal epithelium with NL63 on-chip led to inflammation of the endothelium as demonstrated by loss of barrier function, increased cytokine production, and recruitment of circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs). Treatment of NL63 infected chips with the approved protease inhibitor drug, nafamostat, inhibited viral entry and resulted in a reduction in both viral load and cytokine secretion, whereas remdesivir, one of the few drugs approved for COVID19 patients, was not found to be effective and it also was toxic to the endothelium. This model of intestinal infection was also used to test the effects of other drugs that have been proposed for potential repurposing against SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, these data suggest that the human Intestine Chip might be useful as a human preclinical model for studying coronavirus related pathology as well as for testing of potential anti-viral or anti-inflammatory therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the ensuing COVID-19 pandemic have caused [~]40 million cases and over 648,000 deaths in the United States alone. Troubling disparities in COVID-19-associated mortality emerged early, with nearly 70% of deaths confined to Black/African-American (AA) patients in some areas, yet targeted studies within this demographic are scant. Multi-omics single-cell analyses of immune profiles from airways and matching blood samples of Black/AA patients revealed low viral load, yet pronounced and persistent pulmonary neutrophilia with advanced features of cytokine release syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including exacerbated production of IL-8, IL-1{beta}, IL-6, and CCL3/4 along with elevated levels of neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase. Circulating S100A12+/IFITM2+ mature neutrophils are recruited via the IL-8/CXCR2 axis, which emerges as a potential therapeutic target to reduce pathogenic neutrophilia and constrain ARDS in severe COVID-19.\n\nGraphical AbstractThe lung pathology due to severe COVID-19 is marked by a perpetual pathogenic neutrophilia, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) even in the absence of viral burden. Circulating mature neutrophils are recruited to the airways via IL-8 (CXCL8)/CXCR2 chemotaxis. Recently migrated neutrophils further differentiate into a transcriptionally active and hyperinflammatory state, with an exacerbated expression of IL-8 (CXCL8), IL-1{beta} (IL1B), CCL3, CCL4, neutrophil elastase (NE), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Airway neutrophils and recruited inflammatory monocytes further increase their production of IL-8 (CXCL8), perpetuating lung neutrophilia in a feedforward loop. MdCs and T cells produce IL-1{beta} and TNF, driving neutrophils reprogramming and survival.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=142 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/446468v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@81fd3aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@181e63org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@172fedcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ba55a7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Here we report that early developing B cells are also present in the meninges of mice at all ages. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis revealed a consecutive trajectory of meningeal developing B cells in mice and non-human primates (NHPs). Parabiosis together with lineage tracing of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) showed that meningeal developing B cells are continuously replenished from the HSC-derived progenitors via a circulationindependent route. Importantly, autoreactive immature B cells which recognize myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)5, a central nervous system (CNS)-specific antigen, are eliminated from the meninges but not BM. Furthermore, genetic deletion of MOG restored the self-reactive B cells in the meninges. Thus, we propose that meninges function as a unique reservoir for B cell development, allowing in situ negative selection of CNS-antigen-autoreactive B cells to ensure a local non-self-reactive immune repertoire.",

    "abstract": "The rapid, global dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 since its initial identification in December 2019 has led to the emergence of a diverse range of variants. The initial concerns regarding the virus were quickly compounded with concerns relating to the impact of its mutated forms on viral infectivity, pathogenicity and immunogenicity. To address the latter, we seek to understand how the mutational landscape of SARS-CoV-2 has shaped HLA-restricted T cell immunity at the population level during the first year of the pandemic, before mass vaccination. We analyzed a total of 330,246 high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies sampled across 143 countries and all major continents. Strikingly, we found that specific mutational patterns in SARS-CoV-2 diversify T cell epitopes in an HLA supertype-dependent manner. In fact, we observed that proline residues are preferentially removed from the proteome of prevalent mutants, leading to a predicted global loss of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes in individuals expressing HLA-B alleles of the B7 supertype family. In addition, we show that this predicted global loss of epitopes is largely driven by a dominant C-to-U mutation type at the RNA level. These results indicate that B7 supertype-associated epitopes, including the most immunodominant ones, were more likely to escape CD8+ T cell immunosurveillance during the first year of the pandemic. Together, our study lays the foundation to help understand how SARS-CoV-2 mutants shape the repertoire of T cell targets and T cell immunity across human populations. The proposed theoretical framework has implications in viral evolution, disease severity, vaccine resistance and herd immunity.",

In 148 patients with severe COVID-19, we found lymphopenia was associated with worse survival. CD4+ lymphopenia predominated, with lower CD4+/CD8+ ratios in severe COVID-19 compared to recovered, mild disease (p<0.0001). In severe disease, immunodominant CD4+ T cell responses to Spike-1(S1) produced increased in vitro TNF-, but impaired proliferation and increased susceptibility to activation-induced cell death (AICD). CD4+TNF-+ T cell responses inversely correlated with absolute CD4+ counts from severe COVID-19 patients (n=76; R=-0.744, P<0.0001). TNF- blockade including infliximab or anti-TNFRI antibodies strikingly rescued S1-specific CD4+ proliferation and abrogated S1-AICD in severe COVID-19 patients (P<0.001). Single-cell RNAseq demonstrated downregulation of Type-1 cytokines and NF{kappa}B signaling in S1-stimulated CD4+ cells with infliximab treatment. Lung CD4+ T cells in severe COVID-19 were reduced and produced higher TNF- versus PBMC.

    "abstract": "Proper spindle orientation is required for asymmetric cell division and the establishment of complex tissue architecture. In the developing epidermis, spindle orientation requires a conserved cortical protein complex of LGN/NuMA/dynein-dynactin. However, how microtubule dynamics are regulated to interact with this machinery and properly position the mitotic spindle is not fully understood. Furthermore, our understanding of the processes that link spindle orientation during asymmetric cell division to cell fate specification in distinct tissue contexts remains incomplete. We report a role for the microtubule catastrophe factor KIF18B in regulating microtubule dynamics to promote spindle orientation in keratinocytes. During mitosis, KIF18B accumulates at the cell cortex, colocalizing with the conserved spindle orientation machinery. In vivo we find that KIF18B is required for oriented cell divisions within the hair placode, the first stage of hair follicle morphogenesis, but is not essential in the interfollicular epidermis. Disrupting spindle orientation in the placode, using mutations in either KIF18B or NuMA, results in aberrant cell fate marker expression of hair follicle progenitor cells. These data functionally link spindle orientation to cell fate decisions during hair follicle morphogenesis. Taken together, our data demonstrate a role for regulated microtubule dynamics in spindle orientation in epidermal cells. This work also highlights the importance of spindle orientation during asymmetric cell division to dictate cell fate specification.",

    "abstract": "The way proliferating animal cells coordinate the growth of their mass, volume, and other relevant size parameters is a long-standing question in biology. Studies focusing on cell mass have identified patterns of mass growth as a function of time and cell cycle phase, but little is known about volume growth. To address this question, we improved our fluorescence exclusion method of volume measurement (FXm) and obtained 1700 single-cell volume growth trajectories of HeLa cells. We find that, during most of the cell cycle, volume growth is close to exponential and proceeds at a higher rate in S-G2 than in G1. Comparing the data with a mathematical model, we establish that the cell-to-cell variability in volume growth arises from constant-amplitude fluctuations in volume steps, rather than fluctuations of the underlying specific growth rate. We hypothesize that such \"additive noise\" could emerge from the processes that regulate volume adaptation to biophysical cues, such as tension or osmotic pressure.",

    "abstract": "1.Mesoscale eddies have been shown to support elevated dinitrogen (N2) fixation rates (NFRs) and abundances of N2-fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs), but the mechanisms underlying these observations are not well understood. We explored relationships among NFRs and cyanobacterial diazotroph abundances in eddy pairs of opposite polarity sampled in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and compared our observations to seasonal trends from the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program. Consistent with previous reports, we found that NFRs were anomalously high for this region (up to 3.7-fold above previous monthly HOT observations) in the centers of the sampled anticyclones, coinciding with elevated abundances of Crocosphaera in the summertime. We then coupled our field-based observations, together with transcriptomic analyses of nutrient stress marker genes and ecological models, to evaluate potential mechanisms controlling diazotroph abundance and activity at the mesoscale. Specifically, we evaluated the role of biological (via estimates of growth and grazing rates) and physical controls on populations of Crocosphaera, Trichodesmium, and diatom symbionts. Our results suggest that increased Crocosphaera abundances associated with summertime anticyclones resulted from the alleviation of phosphate limitation, allowing cells to grow at rates exceeding grazing losses. In contrast, distributions of larger, buoyant taxa (Trichodesmium and diatom symbionts) appeared less affected by eddy-driven biological controls. Instead, they appeared driven by physical dynamics along frontal boundaries that separate cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. Together, the interplay of eddy-specific changes in bottom-up control, top-down control, and the physical accumulation of cells likely explains the elevated diazotroph abundances and NFRs associated with anticyclones and eddy fronts.",

    "abstract": "To maximise fitness, individuals may apply different reproductive strategies. Such strategies could be phenotypically plastic and vary depending on the environment. For example, when resources are limited females often face a trade-off between investing in offspring quantity and quality, and how she balances this trade-off may depend on the environment. For phytophagous insects, and especially generalist insects, variation in host plant quality could have large effects on mating, reproduction and offspring performance. Here, we study if the polyphagous moth Spodoptera littoralis, which selects host plants through experience-based preference induction, also has a flexible allocation between egg weight and egg number as well as in temporal egg-laying behavior depending on larval host plant species. We found that S. littoralis has a canalized egg size and that an increased reproductive investment is made in egg quantity rather than egg quality. This increased investment depends on larval host plant species, probably reflecting parental condition. The constant egg weight may be due to physiological limitations or to limited possibilities to increase fitness through larger offspring size. We furthermore found that differences in onset of egg-laying is mainly due to differences in mating propensity between individuals raised on different host plant species. Thus, females do not seem to make a strategic reproductive investment in challenging environments. Instead, the low-quality host plant induces less and later reproduction, which could have consequences for population dynamics in the field.",

    "abstract": "The modular organization of a cell which can be determined by its interaction network allows us to understand a mesh of cooperation among the functional modules. Therefore, cellular level identification of functional modules aids in understanding the functional and structural characteristics of the biological network of a cell and also assists in determining or comprehending the evolutionary signal. We develop ProFuM-Cell that performs real-time web scraping for generating clusters of the cellular level functional units of an organism. ProFuMCell constructs the Protein Locality Graphs and clusters the cellular level functional units of an organism by utilizing experimentally verified data from various online sources. Also, we develop ProModb, a database service that houses precomputed whole-cell protein-protein interaction network-based functional modules of an organism using ProFuMCell. Our web service is entirely synchronized with the KEGG pathway database and allows users to generate spatially localized protein modules for any organism belonging to the KEGG genome using its real-time web scraping characteristics. Hence, the server will host as many organisms as is maintained by the KEGG database. Our web services provide the users a comprehensive and integrated tool for an efficient browsing and extraction of the spatial locality-based protein locality graph and the functional modules constructed by gathering experimental data from several interaction databases and pathway maps. We believe that our web services will be beneficial in pharmacological research, where a novel research domain called modular pharmacology has initiated the study on the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of deadly diseases using functional modules.\n\nGraphical TOC Entry\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/446966v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@145374borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13121aeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9a3681org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@707985_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The conventional sequence comparison-based evolutionary studies ignore other evolutionary constraints like interaction among proteins, functions of proteins and genes etc. A lot of speculations exist in literature regarding the presence of species divergence at the level of the Protein Interaction Networks. Additionally, it has been conjectured that the intra-module connections stay conserved whereas the inter-module connections change during evolution. The most important components of the biological networks are the functional modules which are more conserved among the evolutionary closer species. Here, we demonstrate an alternative method to decipher biological evolution by exploiting the topology of a spatially localized Protein Interaction Network called Protein Locality Graph (PLG). Our lossless graph compression from PLG to a power graph called Protein Cluster Interaction Network (PCIN) results in a 90% size reduction and aids in improving computational time. Further, we exploit the topology of PCIN and demonstrate our capability of deriving the correct species tree by focusing on the cross-talk between the protein modules exclusively. Our results provide new evidence that traces of evolution are not only present at the level of the Protein-Protein Interactions, but are also very much present at the level of the inter-module interactions.",

    "abstract": "Seawater intrusion caused by anthropogenic climate change may affect freshwater species and their parasites. While brackish water certainly impacts freshwater systems globally, its impact on disease transmission is largely unknown. This study examined the effect of artificial seawater on host-parasite interactions using a freshwater snail host, Biomphalaria alexandrina, and the human trematode parasite Schistosoma mansoni. Four components were analyzed to evaluate the impact of increasing salinity on disease transmission: snail survival, snail reproduction, infection prevalence, and the survival of the parasite infective stage (cercariae). We found a decrease in snail survival, snail egg mass production, and snail infection prevalence as salinity increases. However, cercarial survival peaked at an intermediate salinity value. Our results suggest that seawater intrusion into freshwaters has the potential to decrease schistosome transmission to humans.\n\nAuthor SummaryClimate change will have numerous impacts on many systems, including host-parasite systems. One mechanism by which climate change with impact host-parasite interactions is by rising sea levels flooding coastal regions, increasing salinity in many freshwaters. Host-parasite interactions are a key component of freshwater ecosystems, but the effects of sea water intrusion on host-parasite dynamics are largely unknown. In this study, we quantify the effects of sea salt concentration on the model host-parasite system, Biomphalaria alexandrina and Schistosoma mansoni. We demonstrate a significant, negative relationship between sea salt concentration and host-parasite survival and reproduction. The increase in freshwater salinity associated with sea level rise has the potential to decrease parasite transmission and disease burden in humans and wildlife.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/446887v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@529bd5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@174cc80org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11e0912org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e5ab7a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBillions of doses of medicines are donated for mass drug administrations in support of the World Health Organizations \"Roadmap to Implementation,\" which aims to control, eliminate, and eradicate Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). The supply chain to deliver these medicines is complex, with fragmented data systems and limited visibility on performance. This study empirically evaluates the impact of an online supply chain performance measurement system, \"NTDeliver,\" providing understanding of the value of information sharing towards the success of global health programs.\n\nMethodsRetrospective secondary data was extracted from NTDeliver, which included 1,484 shipments for four critical medicines ordered by over 100 countries between February 28, 2006 and December 31, 2018. We applied statistical regression models to analyze the impact on key performance metrics, comparing data before and after the system was implemented.\n\nFindingsThe results suggest information sharing has a positive impact on three performance indicators: purchase order timeliness ({beta}=1.01, p<0.000), arrival timeliness ({beta}=0.53, p=0.09), and--most importantly--delivery timeliness ({beta}=0.73, p=0.03). Three variables indicated an increased positive impact when the data is publicly shared: shipment timeliness ({beta}=2.57, p=0.001), arrival timeliness ({beta}=2.88, p=0{middle dot}003), and delivery timeliness ({beta}=2.82, p=0.01).\n\nConclusionsOur findings suggest that information sharing between the NTD program partners can help drive improved performance in the supply chain, and even more so when data is shared publicly. Given the large volume of medicine and the significant number of people requiring these medicines, information sharing has the potential to provide improvements to global health programs affecting the health of tens to hundreds of millions of people\n\nAuthor SummaryThe supply chain to deliver donated preventive chemotherapy medicines is complex due to the many stakeholders and partnerships participating, as well as challenging because the logistics are further complicated by delivery to remote destinations in developing countries. As MDA campaigns involve treating hundreds of thousands to millions of patients in endemic regions within entire countries over the course of days or weeks, close coordination and timing of medicine delivery is critical. Inefficiencies caused by fragmented data systems and limited transparency on supply chain performance further challenges the ability to identify shipment issues and explore the root cause of the issues. Prior to 2016, delivery was performing below standards, lagging as much as 40% below the WHO target of 80% on-time delivery. These delays result in wasted medicine donations, increased program costs, delayed MDAs, or sometimes even completely missed MDAs. In September 2016, an online supply chain performance measurement system, \"NTDeliver,\" was launched by the NTD Supply Chain Forum (a public-private partnership focused on managing and improving the PC donation supply chain) to enhance supply chain performance and information transparency. Our findings suggest that information sharing through NTDeliver is positively associated with performance at several key stages in NTD supply chain and that information sharing has more substantial positive impact on performance when the information is made publicly accessible, focused towards country program managers. The study findings support investment in supply chain systems and commitment to data transparency, in the context of a growing focus on supply chain investment in NTD programs.",

    "abstract": "Changes in land-use and the associated shifts in environmental conditions can have large effects on the transmission and emergence of disease. Mosquito-borne disease are particularly sensitive to these changes because mosquito growth, reproduction, survival and susceptibility to infection are all thermally sensitive traits, and land use change dramatically alters local microclimate. Predicting disease transmission under environmental change is increasingly critical for targeting mosquito-borne disease control and for identifying hotspots of disease emergence. Mechanistic models offer a powerful tool for improving these predications. However, these approaches are limited by the quality and scale of temperature data and the thermal response curves that underlie predictions. Here, we used fine-scale temperature monitoring and a combination of empirical, laboratory and temperature-dependent estimates to estimate the vectorial capacity of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes across a tropical forest - oil palm plantation conversion gradient in Malaysian Borneo. We found that fine-scale differences in temperature between logged forest and oil palm plantation sites were not sufficient to produce differences in temperature-dependent trait estimates using published thermal performance curves. However, when measured under field conditions a key parameter, adult abundance, differed significantly between land-use types, resulting in estimates of vectorial capacity that were 1.5 times higher in plantations than in forests. The prediction that oil palm plantations would support mosquito populations with higher vectorial capacity was robust to uncertainties in our adult survival estimates. These results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding the effects of forest conversion on mosquito-borne disease risk, and a framework for interpreting emergent relationships between land-use and disease transmission. As rising demand for palm oil products drives continued expansion of plantations, these findings have important implications for conservation, land management and public health policy at the global scale.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe large scale modification of landscapes by humans has contributed to the rise of emerging and re-emerging mosquito-borne diseases. While the association between athropogenic land-use change and these shifts in disease risk are frequently observed, our understanding of exactly how land-use change mechanistically alters disease risk remains unclear. Changes in local environmental conditions (e.g. temperature) may play an important role, due to the effects on mosquito life-history, but are rarely measured at scales relevant these small-bodied ectotherms. Here we measure the impact of tropical forest conversion to oil palm plantation on each of the components that determine the potential for mosquitoes to transmit pathogens (vectorial capacity). By combining fine-scale temperature data from the field, published temperature responses of mosquitoes and field data on adult mosquito populations, we show that land-use change from forest to plantation can be expected to increase vectorial capacity by 150%. Our results highlight the need to advance field research into fundamental mosquito ecology, and to more critically evaluate the increased risk of Aedes-borne disease in dynamic working landscapes against the benefits of economic development.",
