    "abstract": "Repurposing of drugs for new therapeutic use has received considerable attention for its potential to reduce time and cost of drug development. Here we present a new strategy to identify chemicals that are likely to induce differentiation of leukemic cells. As Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is the result of a block in myeloid differentiation, finding new drugs that are capable of inducing blast terminal maturation is considered a valuable strategy. We used data from the Connectivity Map (CMap) to identify drugs that could be repositioned for their potential to activate transcription factors that mediate myeloid differentiation. Compounds promoting the activation of transcription factors that play a positive role in myeloid differentiation were considered candidate pro-differentiation drugs. This approach yielded a list of chemicals ranked according to the potential to activate transcription factors that induce differentiation of leukemic progenitor cells. Drugs that are already used in differentiation therapy, such as for instance all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) are in the top positions of this ranked list. To validate our strategy, we tested the in vitro differentiation potential of 22 candidate compounds using the HL-60 human cell line as a myeloid differentiation model. Ten out of 22 compounds, ranking high in the inferred list, were confirmed to induce significant differentiation of HL-60. Some of these compounds are known to trigger the DNA damage response, thus identifying this process as a target to modulate myeloid differentiation. These results underscore the potential of our approach to accelerate the drug discovery process. The method that we have developed is highly versatile and it can be adapted to different drug repurposing projects.",

    "abstract": "Obesity promotes type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic pathologies. Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) is used to treat obesity resulting in long-term weight loss and health improvements that precede weight loss; however, the mechanisms underlying the immediate benefits remain incompletely understood. Because adipose plays a crucial role in energy homeostasis and utilization, we hypothesized that VSG exerts its influences, in part, by modulating adipose functional states. We applied single-cell ATAC sequencing and lipid profiling to inguinal and epididymal adipose depots from mice that received sham surgery or VSG. We observed depot-specific cellular composition and chromatin accessibility patterns that were altered by VSG. Specifically, accessibility at Scd1, a fatty acid desaturase, was substantially reduced after VSG in mature adipocytes of inguinal but not epididymal depots. This was accompanied by reduced accumulation of SCD1-produced unsaturated fatty acids. Given these findings and reports that reductions in Scd1 attenuate obesity and insulin resistance and that unsaturated fatty acids stimulate glucose uptake, storage, and oxidation, our results suggest VSG exerts its beneficial effects through modifications of fatty acid profiles mediated by Scd1.",

    "abstract": "An RNA polymerase ribozyme that has been the subject of extensive directed evolution efforts has attained the ability to synthesize complex functional RNAs, including a full-length copy of its own evolutionary ancestor. During the course of evolution, the catalytic core of the ribozyme has undergone a major structural rearrangement, resulting in a novel tertiary structural element that lies in close proximity to the active site. Through a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, structural probing, and deep sequencing analysis, the trajectory of evolution was seen to involve the progressive stabilization of the new structure, which provides the basis for improved catalytic activity of the ribozyme. Multiple paths to the new structure were explored by the evolving population, converging upon a common solution. Tertiary structural remodeling of RNA is known to occur in nature, as evidenced by the phylogenetic analysis of extant organisms, but this type of structural innovation had not previously been observed in an experimental setting. Despite prior speculation that the catalytic core of the ribozyme had become trapped in a narrow local fitness optimum, the evolving population has broken through to a new fitness locale, suggesting that further improvement of polymerase activity may be achievable.",

    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal tissue injuries, including the damage and rupture of ligaments and tendons, and volumetric muscle loss (VML), are exceptionally commonplace and often lead to permanent disability and deformation. We developed an advanced biomanufacturing platform producing cellularized collagen microfiber implants to facilitate functional repair and regeneration of musculoskeletal soft tissues. This Assembled Cell-Decorated Collagen (AC-DC) bioprinting process rapidly and reproducibly forms 3D implants using clinically relevant cells and strong, microfluidic extruded collagen fibers. Quantitative analysis showed that the directionality and distribution of cells throughout AC-DC implants mimic the cellular properties of native musculoskeletal tissue. AC-DC bioprinted implants further approximate or exceed the strength and stiffness of human tendons and ligaments and exceeded the properties of commonplace collagen hydrogels by orders of magnitude. The regenerative potential of AC-DC implants was also assessed in vivo in a rodent VML model. A critically sized muscle injury in the hindlimb was created and repaired, and limb torque generation potential was measured over 12 weeks. Both acellular and cellular implants were found to promote functional recovery compared to the unrepaired group, with AC-DC implants containing therapeutic muscle progenitor cells promoting the highest degree of recovery. Histological analysis and automated image processing of explanted muscle cross-sections revealed increased total muscle fiber count, median muscle fiber size, and increased cellularization for injuries repaired with cellularized implants. These studies introduce the tremendous potential of an advanced bioprinting method for generating tissue analogs with near-native biological and biomechanical properties with the potential to repair numerous challenging musculoskeletal injuries.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryBioprinted collagen microfiber-based implants mimic musculoskeletal tissue properties in vitro and promote functional recovery in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Characterization of protein complexes, i.e. sets of proteins assembling into a single larger physical entity, is important, as such assemblies play many essential roles in cells such as gene regulation. From networks of protein-protein interactions, potential protein complexes can be identified computationally through the application of community detection methods, which flag groups of entities interacting with each other in certain patterns. Most community detection algorithms tend to be unsupervised and assume that communities are dense network subgraphs, which is not always true, as protein complexes can exhibit diverse network topologies. The few existing supervised machine learning methods are serial and can potentially be improved in terms of accuracy and scalability by using better-suited machine learning models and parallel algorithms. Here, we present Super.Complex, a distributed, supervised AutoML-based pipeline for overlapping community detection in weighted networks. We also propose three new evaluation measures for the outstanding issue of comparing sets of learned and known communities satisfactorily. Super.Complex learns a community fitness function from known communities using an AutoML method and applies this fitness function to detect new communities. A heuristic local search algorithm finds maximally scoring communities, and a parallel implementation can be run on a computer cluster for scaling to large networks. On a yeast protein-interaction network, Super.Complex outperforms 6 other supervised and 4 unsupervised methods. Application of Super.Complex to a human protein-interaction network with ~8k nodes and ~60k edges yields 1,028 protein complexes, with 234 complexes linked to SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 virus, with 111 uncharacterized proteins present in 103 learned complexes. Super.Complex is generalizable with the ability to improve results by incorporating domain-specific features. Learned community characteristics can also be transferred from existing applications to detect communities in a new application with no known communities.

The point-like curvature profile, obtained by means of the Chern-Simons currents, can be used to infer the position of the given mutations within the genetic string.

    "abstract": "GABA ({gamma}-amino butyric acid) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain that can mediate depolarizing responses during development or after neuropathological insults. Under which conditions GABAergic membrane depolarizations are sufficient to impose excitatory effects is hard to predict, as shunting inhibition and GABAergic effects on spatiotemporal filtering of excitatory inputs must be considered. To evaluate at which reversal potential a net excitatory effect was imposed by GABA (EGABAThr), we performed a detailed in-silico study using simple neuronal topologies and distinct spatiotemporal relations between GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs.\n\nThese simulations revealed for GABAergic synapses located at the soma an EGABAThr close to action potential threshold (EAPThr), while with increasing dendritic distance EGABAThr shifted to positive values. The impact of GABA on AMPA-mediated inputs revealed a complex temporal and spatial dependency. EGABAThr depends on the temporal relation between GABA and AMPA inputs, with a striking negative shift in EGABAThr for AMPA inputs appearing after the GABA input. The spatial dependency between GABA and AMPA inputs revealed a complex profile, with EGABAThr being shifted to values negative to EAPThr for AMPA synapses located proximally to the GABA input, while for distally located AMPA synapses the dendritic distance had only a minor effect on EGABAThr. For tonic GABAergic conductances EGABAThr was negative to EAPThr over a wide range of gGABAtonic values. In summary, these results demonstrate that for several physiologically relevant situations EGABAThr is negative to EAPThr, suggesting that depolarizing GABAergic responses can mediate excitatory effects even if EGABA did not reach EAPThr.\n\nAuthor summaryThe neurotransmitter GABA mediates an inhibitory action in the mature brain, while it was found that GABA provokes depolarizations in the immature brain of after neurological insults. It is, however, not clear to which extend these GABAergic depolarizations con contribute to an excitatory effect. In the present manuscript we approached this question with a computational model of a simplified neurons to determine which amount of a GABAergic depolarizing effect, which we quantified by the so called GABA reversal potential (EGABA), was required to turn GABAergic inhibition to excitation. The results of our simulations revealed that if GABA was applied alone a GABAergic excitation was induced when EGABA was around the action potential threshold. When GABA was applied together with additional excitatory inputs, which is the physiological situation in the brain, only for spatially and temporally correlated inputs EGABA was close to the action potential threshold. For situations in which the additional excitatory inputs appear after the GABA input or are distant to the GABA input, an excitatory effect of GABA could be observed already at EGABA substantially negative to the action potential threshold. This results indicate that even slightly depolarizing GABA responses, which may be induced during or after neurological insults, can potentially turn GABAergic inhibition into GABAergic excitation.",

    "abstract": "The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is a broad inhibitor of virus replication. Its best-characterized function is to bind CpG dinucleotides present in viral RNA and, through the recruitment of TRIM25, KHNYN and other cellular RNA degradation machinery, target them for degradation or prevent their translation. ZAPs activity requires the N-terminal RNA binding domain that selectively binds CpG-containing RNA. However, much less is known about the functional contribution of the remaining domains. Using ZAP-sensitive and ZAP-insensitive human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1), we show that the catalytically inactive poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) domain of the long ZAP isoform (ZAP-L) is essential for CpG-specific viral restriction. Mutation of a crucial cysteine in the C-terminal CaaX box that mediates S-farnesylation and, to a lesser extent, the inactive catalytic site triad within the PARP domain, disrupted the activity of ZAP-L. Addition of the CaaX box to ZAP-S partly restored antiviral activity, explaining why ZAP-S lacks CpG-dependent antiviral activity despite conservation of the RNA-binding domain. Confocal microscopy confirmed the CaaX motif mediated localization of ZAP-L to vesicular structures and enhanced physical association with intracellular membranes. Importantly, the PARP domain and CaaX box together modulate the interaction between ZAP-L and its cofactors TRIM25 and KHNYN, implying that its proper subcellular localisation is required to establish an antiviral complex. The essential contribution of the PARP domain and CaaX box to ZAP-Ls CpG-directed antiviral activity was further confirmed by inhibition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication. Thus, compartmentalization of ZAP-L on intracellular membranes provides an essential effector function in the ZAP-L-mediated antiviral activity.\n\nAuthor summaryCell-intrinsic antiviral factors, such as the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP), provide a first line of defence against viral pathogens. ZAP acts by selectively binding CpG dinucleotide-rich RNAs, which are more common in some viruses than their vertebrate hosts, leading to their degradation. Here, we show that the ability to target these foreign elements is not only dependent on ZAPs N-terminal RNA-binding domain, but additional determinants in the central and C-terminal regions also regulate this process. The PARP domain and its associated CaaX box, are crucial for ZAPs CpG-specific activity and required for optimal binding to cofactors TRIM25 and KHNYN. Furthermore, a CaaX box, known to mediate post-translational modification by a hydrophobic S-farnesyl group, caused re-localization of ZAP from the cytoplasm and increased its association with intracellular membranes. This change in ZAPs distribution was essential for inhibition of both a ZAP-sensitized HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Our work unveils how the determinants outside the CpG RNA-binding domain assist ZAPs antiviral activity and highlights the role of S-farnesylation and membrane association in this process.",

    "abstract": "Alphaviruses and flaviviruses have class II fusion glycoproteins that are essential for virion assembly and infectivity. Importantly, the tip of domain II is structurally conserved between the alphavirus and flavivirus fusion proteins, yet whether these structural similarities between virus families translate to functional similarities is unclear. Using in vivo evolution of Zika virus (ZIKV), we identified several novel emerging variants including an envelope glycoprotein variant in {beta}-strand c (V114M) of domain II. We have previously shown that the analogous {beta}-strand c and the ij loop, located in the tip of domain II of the alphavirus E1 glycoprotein, are important for infectivity. This led us to hypothesize that flavivirus E {beta}-strand c also contributes to flavivirus infection. We generated this ZIKV glycoprotein variant and found that while it had little impact on infection in mosquitoes, it reduced replication in human cells and mice, and increased virus sensitivity to ammonium chloride, as seen for alphaviruses. In light of these results and given our alphavirus ij loop studies, we mutated a conserved alanine at the tip of the flavivirus ij loop to valine to test its effect on ZIKV infectivity. Interestingly, this mutation inhibited infectious virion production of ZIKV and yellow fever virus, but not West Nile virus. Together, these studies show that structurally analogous residues in the alphavirus and flavivirus class II fusion proteins contribute to virus infection in vivo and highlight these shared domains as targets for broad-spectrum arbovirus therapies.\n\nAuthor SummaryArboviruses are a significant global public health threat, yet there are no antivirals targeting these viruses. This problem is in part due to our lack of knowledge on the molecular mechanisms involved in the arbovirus life cycle. In particular, virus entry and assembly are essential processes in the virus life cycle and steps that can be targeted for the development of antiviral therapies. Therefore, understanding common, fundamental mechanisms used by different arboviruses for entry and assembly is essential. In this study, we show that flavivirus and alphavirus residues located in structurally conserved and analogous regions of the class II fusion proteins contribute to common mechanisms of entry, dissemination, and infectious virion production. These studies highlight how class II fusion proteins function and provide novel targets for development of antivirals.",

    "abstract": "The accessory protein Nef of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV) is an important pathogenicity factor known to interact with cellular protein kinases and other signaling proteins. A canonical SH3 domain binding motif in Nef is required for most of these interactions. For example, HIV-1 Nef activates the tyrosine kinase Hck by tightly binding to its SH3 domain. An archetypal contact between a negatively charged SH3 residue and a highly conserved arginine in Nef (Arg77) plays a key role here. Combining structural analyses with functional assays, we here show that Nef proteins have also developed a distinct structural strategy - termed the \"R-clamp\" - that favors the formation of this salt bridge via buttressing Arg77. Comparison of evolutionarily diverse Nef proteins revealed that several distinct R-clamps have evolved that are functionally equivalent but differ in the side chain compositions of Nef residues 83 and 120. Whereas a similar R-clamp design is shared by Nef proteins of HIV-1 groups M, O, and P, as well as SIVgor, the Nef proteins of SIV from the Eastern chimpanzee subspecies (SIVcpzP.t.s.) exclusively utilize another type of R-clamp. By contrast, SIV of Central chimpanzees (SIVcpzP.t.t.) and HIV-1 group N strains show more heterogenous R-clamp design principles, including a non-functional evolutionary intermediate of the aforementioned two classes. These data add to our understanding of the structural basis of SH3 binding and kinase deregulation by Nef, and provide an interesting example of primate lentiviral protein evolution.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYViral replication depends on interactions with a plethora of host cell proteins. Cellular protein interactions are typically mediated by specialized binding modules, such as the SH3 domain. To gain access to host cell regulation viruses have evolved to contain SH3 domain binding sites in their proteins, a notable example of which is the HIV-1 Nef protein. Here we show that during the primate lentivirus evolution the structural strategy that underlies the avid binding of Nef to cellular SH3 domains, which we have dubbed the R-clamp, has been generated via alternative but functionally interchangeable molecular designs. These patterns of SH3 recognition depend on the amino acid combinations at the positions corresponding to residues 83 and 120 in the consensus HIV-1 Nef sequence, and are distinctly different in Nef proteins from SIVs of Eastern and Central chimpanzees, gorillas, and the four groups of HIV-1 that have independently originated from the latter two. These results highlight the evolutionary plasticity of viral proteins, and have implications on therapeutic development aiming to interfere with SH3 binding of Nef.",

    "abstract": "Signals from the germline play a significant role in determining longevity in numerous animal models. In C. elegans, ablation of the germline leads to long life span and various other types of stress resistance. It has been reported that mutations that block oogenesis or an upstream step in germline development confer strong resistance to hypoxia. We report here that the hypoxia resistance of sterile mutants is dependent on developmental stage and age. In just a 12-hour period, sterile animals transform from hypoxia sensitive L4 larvae into highly hypoxia resistant adults. Since this transformation occurs in animals with no germline, the physiological programs that determine hypoxia sensitivity must occur independently of germline signals and instead rely on developmental signals from somatic tissues. Furthermore, we found two distinct mechanisms of hypoxia resistance in long-lived germline deficient animals. First, a DAF-16/FoxO independent mechanism that occurs in all hypoxia resistant sterile adults and, second, a DAF-16/FoxO dependent mechanism that confers an added layer of resistance, or \"super-resistance\", to animals with no germline as they age past day 1 of adulthood. RNAseq data showed that nearly all genes involved in both cytosolic and mitochondrial protein translation, as well as in mitochondrial protein import, are repressed in germline deficient adults and further repressed as they age. The hypoxia super-resistance of aging germline deficient animals was suppressed by dual mutation of ncl-1 and larp-1, two regulators of nucleolar biology and protein translation, demonstrating that the hypoxia super-resistance mechanism involves reduced protein translation. These studies provide novel insight into a profound physiological transformation that takes place in germline mutants during development, showing that some of the unique physiological properties of these long-lived animals are dependent on developmental repression of genes involved in protein translation, which operate independently of germline signals.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIn addition to being extremely long lived, germline deficient animals have other extraordinary properties, such as robust resistance to oxygen deprivation. Here we provide new insight into the mechanisms of hypoxia resistance in germline deficient animals. We demonstrate that, in just a 12-hour period, germline mutants transform from hypoxia sensitive larvae into highly hypoxia resistant adults. Therefore, hypoxia resistance is not a general property of germline ablated animals, but is instead \"switched on\" only in adult animals. We have found two distinct mechanisms of hypoxia resistance in germline deficient animals and both mechanisms are mediated by signals from somatic tissues and do not require the germline. We have determined that reduced transcription of genes involved in protein translation is one of the mechanisms of hypoxia resistance. Like hypoxia resistance, repression of protein translation genes only occurs in adults. Our findings establish that the unique physiological properties of germline-deficient animals are \"switched\" on in adults and therefore must be mediated by developmental signals from somatic tissues. We conclude that the L4/adult developmental switch in germline ablated animals presents an excellent system for investigating the longevity and hypoxia resistance of germline deficient animals.",

    "abstract": "The study of perceptual decision making in monkeys has provided insights into the process by which sensory evidence is integrated towards a decision. When monkeys make decisions with the knowledge of the motor actions the decisions bear upon, the process of evidence integration is instantiated by neurons involved in the selection of said actions. It is less clear how monkeys make decisions when unaware of the actions required to communicate their choice--what we refer to as  abstract decisions. We investigated this by training monkeys to associate the direction of motion of a noisy random-dot display with the color of two targets. Crucially, the targets were displayed at unpredictable locations after the motion stimulus was extinguished. We found that monkeys postponed decision formation until the targets were revealed. Neurons in the parietal association area LIP represented the integration of evidence leading to a choice, but as the stimulus was no longer visible, the samples of evidence must have been retrieved from short-term memory. Our results imply that when decisions are temporally unyoked from the motor actions they bear upon, decision formation is protracted until they can be framed in terms of motor actions.",
