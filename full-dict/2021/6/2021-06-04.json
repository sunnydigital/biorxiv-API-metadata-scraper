    "abstract": "BackgroundDermatophytosis is an infectious disease of global significance caused by several fungal species, which affects the hair, nails, or superficial layers of the skin. The most common zoonotic dermatophytes are Microsporum canis, Nannizzia gypsea and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Woods lamp examination, microscopic identification and fungal culture are the main conventional diagnostic methods used in clinics. Less common methods are dermatophyte PCR and biopsy/histopathology. However, these methods also have limitations for providing both accuracy and timely on-site detection. The recent development of CRISPR-based diagnostic platform provides the possibility of a rapid, accurate, and portable diagnostic tool, which has huge potential for clinical applications.\n\nObjectivesThe purpose of this study is to establish a molecular method for rapid and accurate diagnosis of clinical dermatophytes, which can accelerate clinical diagnostic testing and help timely treatment.\n\nMethodsIn this paper, we design a Cas12a-based assay combined with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) to differentiate three main zoonotic dermatophytes. The limit of detection (LOD) is determined by using standard strains. A total of 25 clinical samples (hair and scurf) are identified to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of this assay.\n\nResultsThe RPA-Cas12a method showed high sensitivity and specificity (100% and 100%, respectively). The results could be observed directly by naked-eyes, and all tested samples were consistent with fungal culture and sequencing results.\n\nConclusionsCompared with other methods, the RPA-Cas12a-fluorescence assay requires less time (30 minutes) and less complicated equipment, and visible changes can be clearly observed, which is suitable for on-site clinical diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "The parasite Cryptosporidium is responsible for diarrheal disease in young children causing death, malnutrition, and growth delay. Cryptosporidium invades enterocytes where it develops in a unique intracellular niche. Infected cells exhibit profound changes in morphology, physiology and transcriptional activity. How the parasite effects these changes is poorly understood. We explored the localization of highly polymorphic proteins and found members of the C. parvum MEDLE protein family to be translocated into the cytoplasm of infected cells. All intracellular life stages engage in this export, which occurs after completion of invasion. Mutational studies defined an N-terminal host-targeting motif and demonstrated proteolytic processing at a specific leucine residue. Direct expression of MEDLE2 in mammalian cells triggered an ER stress response that was also observed during infection. Taken together, our studies reveal the presence of a Cryptosporidium secretion system capable of delivering pathogenesis factors into the infected enterocyte.",

    "abstract": "Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is a gut symbiont that inhabits the mucus layer and adheres to and metabolizes food particles, contributing to gut physiology and maturation. Whereas adhesion and biofilm formation could be key features for B. thetaiotaomicron stress resistance and gut colonization, little is known about the determinants of B. thetaiotaomicron biofilm formation. We previously showed that the B. thetaiotaomicron reference strain VPI-5482 is a poor in vitro biofilm former. Here we demonstrated that bile, a gut-relevant environmental cue, triggers the formation of biofilm in many B. thetaiotaomicron isolates and common gut Bacteroidales species. We identified the genetic determinants of this bile-dependent biofilm formation and showed that it involves the production of the DNase BT3563, degrading extracellular DNA, in biofilms formed in the presence of bile. Our study therefore identifies a physiologically relevant condition inducing B. thetaiotaomicron biofilm and shows that, in contrast to the biofilm-promoting role played by bacterial eDNA scaffold in Firmicutes and Proteobacteria models, degradation of eDNA by BT3563 DNAse and its widespread homologs is required to achieve B. thetaiotaomicron bile-dependent biofilm formation.",

    "abstract": "Many prokaryotes encode CRISPR-Cas systems as immune protection against mobile genetic elements (MGEs), yet, a number of MGEs also harbor CRISPR-Cas components. With a few exceptions, CRISPR-Cas loci encoded on MGEs are uncharted and a comprehensive analysis of their distribution, prevalence, diversity, and function is lacking. Here, we systematically investigated CRISPR-Cas loci across the largest curated collection of natural bacterial and archaeal plasmids. CRISPR-Cas loci are widely but heterogeneously distributed across plasmids and, in comparison to host chromosomes, their mean prevalence per Mbp is higher and their distribution is markedly distinct. Furthermore, the spacer content of plasmid CRISPRs exhibits a strong targeting bias towards other plasmids, while chromosomal arrays are enriched with virus-targeting spacers. These contrasting targeting preferences dominate across the diversity of CRISPR-Cas subtypes and host taxa, highlighting the genetic independence of plasmids and suggesting a major role of CRISPR-Cas for mediating plasmid-plasmid conflicts. Altogether, CRISPR-Cas are frequent accessory components of many plasmids, which is an overlooked phenomenon that possibly facilitates their dissemination across microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "All nitrogen-fixing bacteria and archaea (diazotrophs) use molybdenum (Mo) nitrogenase to reduce dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia. Some diazotrophs also contain alternative nitrogenases that lack Mo: vanadium (V) and iron-only (Fe) nitrogenases. Among diazotrophs, the regulation and usage of the alternative nitrogenases in methanogens is largely unknown. Methanosarcina acetivorans contains nif, vnf, and anf gene clusters encoding putative Mo-, V-, and Fe-nitrogenases, respectively. This study investigated the effect of fixed nitrogen and Mo/V availability on nitrogenase expression and growth by M. acetivorans. The availability of Mo and V did not affect growth of M. acetivorans with fixed nitrogen but significantly affected growth with N2. M. acetivorans exhibited the fastest growth rate and highest cell yield during growth with N2 in medium containing Mo. Depletion of Mo (Fe-only condition) resulted in a significant decrease in growth rate and cell yield. The addition of V to Mo-depleted medium stimulated diazotrophic growth but was still less than growth in Mo-replete medium. qPCR analysis revealed transcription of the nif operon is only moderately affected by depletion of fixed nitrogen and Mo. However, vnf and anf transcription increased significantly when fixed nitrogen and Mo were depleted, with removal of Mo being the key factor. Immunoblot analysis revealed Mo-nitrogenase is produced when fixed nitrogen is depleted regardless of Mo availability, while V- and Fe-nitrogenases are produced only in the absence of fixed nitrogen and Mo. These results reveal that alternative nitrogenase production in M. acetivorans is tightly controlled and that all three nitrogenases can be simultaneously produced.\n\nIMPORTANCEMethanogens and closely related methanotrophs are the only archaea known or predicted to possess nitrogenase. As such, methanogens play critical roles in both the global biological nitrogen and carbon cycles. Moreover, methanogens are an ancient microbial lineage and nitrogenase likely originated in methanogens. An understanding of the usage and properties of nitrogenases in methanogens can provide new insight into the evolution of nitrogen fixation and aid in the development nitrogenase-based biotechnology. This study provides the first evidence that a methanogen can produce all three forms of nitrogenases, even simultaneously. Surprisingly, Mo-nitrogenase was produced in cells grown in the absence of Mo, indicating components of Mo-nitrogenase regulate or are needed to produce V- and Fe-nitrogenases in methanogens. The results provide a foundation to understanding the assembly, regulation, and activity of the alternative nitrogenases in methanogens.",

    "abstract": "DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) is known primarily for its function in DNA double-stranded break repair and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). However, DNA-PKcs also has a critical yet undefined role in immunity impacting both myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages spurring interest in targeting DNA-PKcs for therapeutic strategies in immune-related diseases. To gain insight into the function of DNA-PKcs within immune cells, we performed a quantitative phosphoproteomic screen in T cells to identify first order phosphorylation targets of DNA-PKcs. Results indicate that DNA-PKcs phosphorylates the transcription factor Egr1 (early growth response protein 1) at S301. Expression of Egr1 is induced early upon T cell activation and dictates T cell response by modulating expression of cytokines and key costimulatory molecules. Mutation of serine 301 to alanine via CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in increased proteasomal degradation of Egr1 and a decrease in Egr1-dependent transcription of IL2 (interleukin-2) in activated T cells. Our findings identify DNA-PKcs as a critical intermediary link between T cell activation and T cell fate and a novel phosphosite involved in regulating Egr1 activity.",

    "abstract": "A loss of the checkpoint kinase ATM leads to impairments in the DNA damage response, and in humans causes cerebellar neurodegeneration, and a high risk to cancer. A loss of ATM is also associated with increased protein aggregation. The relevance and characteristics of this aggregation are still incompletely understood. Moreover, it is unclear to what extent other genotoxic conditions can trigger protein aggregation as well. Here, we show that targeting ATM, but also ATR or DNA topoisomerases result in a similar, widespread aggregation of a metastable, disease-associated subfraction of the proteome. Aggregation-prone model substrates, including Huntingtin exon1 containing an expanded polyglutamine repeat, aggregate faster under these conditions. This increased aggregation results from an overload of chaperone systems, which lowers the cell-intrinsic threshold for proteins to aggregate. In line with this, we find that inhibition of the HSP70 chaperone system further exacerbates the increased protein aggregation. Moreover, we identify the molecular chaperone HSPB5 as a potent suppressor of it. Our findings reveal that various genotoxic conditions trigger widespread protein aggregation in a manner that is highly reminiscent of the aggregation occurring in situations of proteotoxic stress and in proteinopathies.",

    "abstract": "The 10-subunit TFIIH complex is vital to both transcription initiation and nucleotide excision repair. Hereditary mutations in its smallest subunit, TTDA/GTF2H5, cause a photosensitive form of the rare developmental brittle hair disorder trichothiodystrophy (TTD). Some TTD features are thought to be caused by subtle transcription or gene expression defects. Strikingly, TTDA/GTF2H5 knockout mice are not viable, which makes it difficult to investigate how TTDA/GTF2H5 promotes transcription in vivo. Here, we show that deficiency of the C. elegans TTDA ortholog GTF-2H5 is, however, compatible with viability and growth, in contrast to depletion of other TFIIH subunits. We also show that GTF-2H5 promotes the stability of TFIIH in multiple tissues and is indispensable for nucleotide excision repair, in which it facilitates recruitment of the TFIIH complex to DNA damage. Strikingly, when transcription is challenged, gtf-2H5 embryos die due to the intrinsic TFIIH fragility in the absence of GTF-2H5. These results support the idea that TTDA/GTF2H5 mutations cause transcription impairment underlying trichothiodystrophy and establish C. elegans as potential model for studying the pathogenesis of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Rhabdomyolysis is the acute breakdown of skeletal myofibres in response to an initiating factor, most commonly toxins and over exertion. A variety of genetic disorders predispose to rhabdomyolysis through different pathogenic mechanisms, particularly in patients with recurrent episodes. However, the majority of cases remain without a genetic diagnosis. Here we present six patients who presented with severe and recurrent rhabdomyolysis, usually with onset in the teenage years; other features included a history of myalgia and muscle cramps. We identified ten bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in the gene encoding obscurin (OBSCN) co-segregating with disease. We show reduced expression of OBSCN and loss of obscurin protein in patient muscle. Obscurin is proposed to be involved in SR function and Ca2+ handling. Patient cultured myoblasts appear more susceptible to starvation as evidenced by a greater decreased in SR Ca2+ content compared to control myoblasts. This likely reflects a lower efficiency when pumping Ca2+ back into the SR and/or a decrease in Ca2+ SR storage ability when metabolism is diminished. OSBCN variants have previously been associated with cardiomyopathies. None of the patients presented with a cardiomyopathy and cardiac examinations were normal in all cases in which cardiac function was assessed. There was also no history of cardiomyopathy in first degree relatives, in particular in any of the carrier parents. This cohort is relatively young, thus follow-up studies and the identification of additional cases with bi-allelic null OBSCN variants will further delineate OBSCN-related disease and the clinical course of disease.",

The current H. vitripennis reference genome from the Baylor College of Medicines i5k pilot project is a 1.4-Gb assembly with 110,000 scaffolds, which still has significant gaps making identification of genes difficult. To improve on this effort, we used a combination of Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing technology combined with Illumina sequencing reads to generate a better assembly and first-pass annotation of the whole genome sequence of a wild-caught Californian (Tulare County) individual of H. vitripennis. The improved reference genome assembly for H. vitripennis is 1.93-Gb in length (21,254 scaffolds, N50 = 650 Mb, BUSCO completeness = 94.3%), with 33.06% of the genome masked as repetitive. In total, 108,762 gene models were predicted including 98,296 protein-coding genes and 10,466 tRNA genes. As an additional community resource, we identified 27 orthologous candidate genes of interest for future experimental work including phenotypic marker genes like white. Further, as part of the assembly process, we generated four endosymbiont metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including a high-quality near complete 1.7-Mb Wolbachia sp. genome (1 scaffold, CheckM completeness = 99.4%). The improved genome assembly and annotation for H. vitripennis, curated set of candidate genes, and endosymbiont MAGs will be invaluable resources for future research of H. vitripennis.",

    "abstract": "The retinol dehydrogenase Rdh10 catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction that converts retinol into retinoic acid (RA), an autacoid that regulates energy balance and suppresses adiposity. Relative to WT, Rdh10+/- males experienced reduced fatty-acid oxidation, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Running endurance decreased 40%. Rdh10+/- females increased reliance on fatty acid oxidation and did not experience glucose intolerance nor insulin resistance. Running endurance improved 2.2-fold. Estrogen increased, revealed by a 40% increase in uterine weight. Because skeletal muscle energy use restricts adiposity and insulin resistance, we assessed the mixed fiber type gastrocnemius muscle (GM) to determine the effects of endogenous RA on muscle metabolism in vivo. RA in Rdh10+/- male GM decreased 38% relative to WT. TAG content increased 1.7-fold. Glut1 mRNA and glucose decreased >30%. Rdh10+/- male GM had impaired electron transport chain activity, and a 60% reduction in fasting ATP. The share of oxidative fibers increased, as did expression of the myogenic transcription factors Myog and Myf5. Centralized nuclei increased 5-fold in fibers--indicating muscle malady or repair. In Rdh10+/- female GM, RA decreased only 17%, due to a 1.8-fold increase in the estrogen-induced retinol dehydrogenase, Dhrs9. Rdh10+/- female GM did not amass TAG, increase oxidative fibers, decrease Glut1 mRNA or glucose, nor increase centralized nuclei. Expression of Myog and Myf5 decreased. Electron transport chain activity increased, elevating fasting ATP >3-fold. Thus, small decreases in skeletal muscle RA affect whole body energy use, insulin resistance and adiposity, in part through estrogen-related sexual dimorphic effects on mitochondria function.",

    "abstract": "LncRNAs are long RNA transcripts that do not code for proteins and that have been shown to play a major role in cellular processes through diverse mechanisms. DRAIC, a lncRNA which is downregulated in castration-resistant advanced prostate cancer, inhibits the NF-kB pathway by inhibiting the I{kappa}B kinase. Decreased DRAIC expression predicted poor patient outcome in gliomas and seven other cancers. We now report that DRAIC suppresses invasion, migration, colony formation and xenograft growth of glioblastoma derived cell lines. DRAIC activates AMPK by downregulating the NF-{kappa}B target gene GLUT1, and thus represses mTOR, leading to downstream effects such as decrease in protein translation and increase in autophagy. DRAIC, therefore, has an effect on multiple signal transduction pathways that are important for oncogenesis: the NF-{kappa}B pathway and AMPK-mTOR-S6K/ULK1 pathway. The regulation of NF-{kappa}B, protein translation and autophagy by the same lncRNA explains the tumor suppressive role of DRAIC in different cancers and reinforces the importance of lncRNAs as emerging regulators of signal transduction pathways.",

    "abstract": "The human brain operates in large-scale functional networks. These networks are thought to arise from neural variability, yet the principles behind this link remain unknown. Here we report a mechanism by which the brains network architecture is tightly linked to critical episodes of neural regularity, visible as spontaneous  complexity drops in functional MRI signals. These episodes support the formation of functional connections between brain regions, subserve the propagation of neural activity, and reflect inter-individual differences in age and behavior. Furthermore, complexity drops define neural states that dynamically shape the coupling strength, topological structure, and hierarchy of brain networks and comprehensively explain known structure-function relationships within the brain. These findings delineate a unifying complexity architecture of neural activity - a human  complexome that underpins the brains functional network organization.",

    "abstract": "Neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus contributes to learning and memory in the healthy brain but is dysregulated in metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. The molecular relationships between neural stem cell activity, adult neurogenesis, and global metabolism are largely unknown. Here we applied unbiased systems genetic methods to quantify genetic covariation among adult neurogenesis and metabolic phenotypes in peripheral tissues of a genetically diverse family of rat strains, derived from a cross between the spontaneously hypertensive (SHR/OlaIpcv) strain and Brown Norway (BN-Lx/Cub). The HXB/BXH family is a very well established model to dissect genetic variants that modulate metabolic and cardiovascular disease and we have accumulated deep phenome and transcriptome data in a FAIR-compliant resource for systematic and integrative analyses. Here we measured rates of precursor cell proliferation, survival of new neurons, and gene expression in the hippocampus of the entire HXB/BXH family, including both parents. These data were combined with published metabolic phenotypes to detect a neurometabolic quantitative trait locus (QTL) for serum glucose and neuronal survival. We subsequently fine-mapped a key phenotype to a locus that includes the telo2-interacting protein 2 gene (Tti2)--a chaperone that modulates the activity and stability of PIKK kinases. To validate variants in or near Tti2 as a cause for differences in neurogenesis and glucose levels, we generated a targeted frameshift mutation on the SHR/OlaIpcv background. Heterozygous SHR-Tti2+/- mutants had lower rates of hippocampal neurogenesis and hallmarks of dysglycemia compared to wild-type littermates. Our findings highlight Tti2 as a causal genetic and molecular link between glucose metabolism and structural brain plasticity. In humans, more than 800 genomic variants are linked to TTI2 expression, seven of which have associations to protein and blood stem cell factor concentrations, blood pressure and frontotemporal dementia.\n\nAuthor summaryMetabolic and neurological disorders are often comorbid, suggesting that biological pathways which orchestrate peripheral homeostasis and the integrity of the nervous system intersect. The genetic architecture behind these relationships is still poorly described, in part because molecular processes in the human brain are very difficult to study. We thus used a rodent genetic reference population to investigate links between adult hippocampal neurogenesis-- a cellular plasticity mechanism important for learning flexibility--and metabolism. We measured adult neurogenesis in the family of 30 HXB/BXH rat recombinant inbred strains, who are characterised by stable differences in metabolism, behaviour, and gene expression levels. Because gene variants affecting distinct traits segregated into different members of the family, we discovered that previously published phenotypes correlated to adult neurogenesis due to shared genomic sequence. We found that expression levels of Tti2--a part of a specialised protein chaperone complex regulating stability of PIKK kinases--were concomitantly influencing adult neurogenesis and serum glucose levels. In human populations hundreds of genomic variants regulate TTI2 expression, potentially affecting brain function and glucose homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Spatial tuning of neocortical pyramidal cells has been observed in diverse cortical regions and is thought to rely primarily on input from the hippocampal formation. Despite the well-studied hippocampal place code, many properties of the neocortical spatial tuning system are still insufficiently understood. In particular, it has remained unclear how the topography of direct anatomical connections from hippocampus to neocortex affects spatial tuning depth, and whether the dynamics of spatial coding in the hippocampal output region CA1 such as remapping in novel environments is transmitted to the neocortex. Using mice navigating through virtual environments we addressed these questions in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex, which receives direct input from the hippocampus. We find a rapidly emerging prefrontal representation of space in the absence of task rules, which discriminates familiar from novel environments and is reinstated upon re-exposure to the same familiar environment. Topographical analysis revealed a dorso-ventral gradient in the representation of the own position, which runs opposite to the innervation density of hippocampal inputs. Jointly, these results reveal a dynamically emerging and topographically organized prefrontal place code during spontaneous locomotion.\n\nSignificance StatementThe neocortex is composed of areas with specialized function (e.g. sensory vs. associational). Despite this functional diversity, emerging evidences suggest that the encoding of space might be a universal feature of cortical circuits. Here, we identified a gradient of spatial tuning depth along the dorso-ventral axis. A complex topography of spatial tuning properties might support a division of labor among medial prefrontal cortical subnetworks to support local circuit computation relevant for the execution of context-dependent behavioral outcomes.",

    "abstract": "An abnormal magnitude of hemispheric difference (i.e. laterality) in corticostriatal circuits is a shared feature of numerous neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Detailed quantitation and regional localization of corticostriatal laterality in normative samples stands to further the understanding of hemispheric differences in healthy and disease states. Here, we used a fingerprinting approach to quantify \"functional connectivity profile laterality\" - the overall magnitude by which a voxels profile of connectivity with homotopic regions of the ipsilateral and contralateral cortex differs - in the striatum. Laterality magnitude heatmaps revealed \"laterality hotspots\" - constituting outliers in the voxel-wise distribution -in the right ventrolateral putamen and left central caudate. Findings were replicated in an independent sample, with significant (p<0.05) spatial overlap observed between the location of the laterality hotspots across samples, as measured via Dice coefficients. At both hotspots, a primary driver of overall laterality was the difference in striatal connectivity strength with the right and left pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus. Right and left striatum laterality magnitude maps were found to significantly differ (p<0.05) at the hotspot locations. Moreover, using subjects left, but not right, striatum laterality magnitude maps, a support vector machine trained on a discovery sample (n=77) and tested on a replication sample (n=77) significantly predicted (r=0.25, p=0.028) subject performance on a language task, known for its lateralized nature. Laterality magnitude maps remained consistent across different cortical atlas parcellations and did not differ significantly between right-handed and left-handed individuals. In sum, meaningful variation in functional connectivity profile laterality - both spatially within the striatum and across subjects - is evident in corticostriatal circuits. Findings provide a basis to examine corticostriatal connectivity profile laterality in psychiatric illness.",

    "abstract": "Licenced London taxi drivers have been found to show changes in the grey matter density of their hippocampus over the course of training and decades of navigation in London (UK). This has been linked to their learning and using of the  Knowledge of London, the names and layout of over 26,000 streets and thousands of points of interest in London. Here we examined the process of how this knowledge is acquired and we detail key steps that include: systematic study of maps, travel on selected overlapping routes, the mental visualisation of places and the optimal use of subgoals. We provide the first map of the street network covered by the routes used to learn, allowing insight into where gaps in the network exist. The methods could be widely applied to aid spatial learning in the general population and may provide insights for artificial intelligence (AI) systems to efficiently learn new environments.",
