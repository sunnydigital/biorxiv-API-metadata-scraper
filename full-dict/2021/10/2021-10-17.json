    "abstract": "Sensorimotor transformations are mediated by premotor brain networks where individual neurons represent sensory, cognitive, and movement-related information. Such multiplexing poses a conundrum - how does a decoder know precisely when to initiate a movement if its inputs are active at times when a movement is not desired (e.g., in response to sensory stimulation)? Here, we propose a novel hypothesis: movement is triggered not only by an increase in firing rate, but critically by a reliable temporal pattern in the population response. Laminar recordings in the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain region that plays an essential role in orienting eye movements, indicate that the temporal structure across neurons is a factor governing movement initiation. Specifically, using a measure that captures the fidelity of the population code - here called temporal stability - we show that the temporal structure fluctuates during the visual response but becomes increasingly stable during the movement command, even when the mean population activity is similar between the two epochs. Analyses of pseudo-populations in SC and cortical frontal eye fields (FEF) corroborated this model. We also used spatiotemporally patterned microstimulation to causally test the contribution of population temporal stability to movement initiation and found that stable stimulation patterns were more likely to evoke a movement, even when other features of the patterns such as mean pulse rates and population state subspaces were matched. Finally, a spiking neuron model was able to discriminate between stable and unstable input patterns, providing a putative biophysical mechanism for decoding temporal structure. These findings offer an alternative perspective on the relationship between movement preparation and generation by situating the correlates of movement initiation in the temporal features of activity in shared neural substrates. They also suggest a need to look beyond the instantaneous rate code at the single neuron or population level and consider the effects of short-term population history on neuronal communication and behaviour.\n\nSummarySensorimotor transformations are mediated by premotor brain networks where individual neurons represent sensory, cognitive, and movement-related information. Such multiplexing poses a conundrum - how does a decoder know precisely when to initiate a movement if its inputs are active at times when a movement is not desired (e.g., in response to sensory stimulation)? Here, we propose a novel hypothesis: movement is triggered not only by an increase in firing rate, but critically by a reliable temporal pattern in the population response. Laminar recordings in the macaque superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain hub of orienting control, and pseudo-population analyses in SC and cortical frontal eye fields (FEF) corroborated this hypothesis. Importantly, we used spatiotemporally patterned microstimulation to causally verify the importance of temporal structure and demonstrate its role in gating movement initiation. We also offer a spiking neuron model with dendritic integration as a putative mechanism to decode this temporal information. These findings offer new insights into the long-standing debate on movement generation and highlight the importance of short-term population history in neuronal communication and behavior.",

    "abstract": "The forms of many species vocal signals are shaped by their functions1-15. In humans, a salient context of vocal signaling is infant care, as human infants are altricial16, 17. Humans often alter their vocalizations to produce \"parentese\", speech and song produced for infants that differ acoustically from ordinary speech and song18-35 in fashions that have been proposed to support parent-infant communication and infant language learning36-39; modulate infant affect33, 40-45; and/or coordinate communicative interactions with infants46-48. These theories predict a form-function link in infant-directed vocalizations, with consistent acoustic differences between infant-directed and adult-directed vocalizations across cultures. Some evidence supports this prediction23, 27, 28, 32, 49-52, but the limited generalizability of individual ethnographic reports and laboratory experiments53 and small stimulus sets54, along with intriguing reports of counterexamples55-62, leave the question open. Here, we show that people alter the acoustic forms of their vocalizations in a consistent fashion across cultures when speaking or singing to infants. We collected 1,615 recordings of infant- and adult-directed singing and speech produced by 410 people living in 21 urban, rural, and small-scale societies, and analyzed their acoustic forms. We found cross-culturally robust regularities in the acoustics of infant-directed vocalizations, such that infant-directed speech and song were reliably classified from acoustic features found across the 21 societies studied. The acoustic profiles of infant-directedness differed across language and music, but in a consistent fashion worldwide. In a secondary analysis, we studied whether listeners are sensitive to these acoustic features, playing the recordings to 51,065 people recruited online, from many countries, who guessed whether each vocalization was infant-directed. Their intuitions were largely accurate, predictable in part by acoustic features of the recordings, and robust to the effects of linguistic relatedness between vocalizer and listener. By uniting rich cross-cultural data with computational methods, we show links between the production of vocalizations and cross-species principles of bioacoustics, informing hypotheses of the psychological functions and evolution of human communication.",

    "abstract": "How we distinguish multiple simultaneous stimuli is uncertain, particularly given that such stimuli sometimes recruit largely overlapping populations of neurons. One commonly proposed hypothesis is that the sharpness of tuning curves might change to limit the number of stimuli driving any given neuron when multiple stimuli are present. To test this hypothesis, we recorded the activity of neurons in the inferior colliculus while monkeys made saccades to either one or two simultaneous sounds differing in frequency and spatial location. Although monkeys easily distinguished simultaneous sounds ([~]90% correct performance), the frequency selectivity of inferior colliculus neurons on dual sound trials did not improve in any obvious way. Frequency selectivity was degraded on dual sound trials compared to single sound trials: neural response functions broadened, and frequency accounted for less of the variance in firing rate. These changes in neural firing led a maximum-likelihood decoder to perform worse on dual sound trials than on single sound trials. These results fail to support the hypothesis that changes in frequency response functions serve to reduce the overlap in the representation of simultaneous sounds. Instead, these results suggest that alternative possibilities, such as recent evidence of alternations in firing rate between the rates corresponding to each of the two stimuli, offer a more promising approach.\n\nGraphic AbstractHow sensory representations encode multiple stimuli despite coarse coding is unknown. Using a maximum likelihood decoder operating on the spike count response patterns of monkey inferior colliculus neurons, we show a marked reduction in decoding accuracy when two sounds are presented compared to one. The decoding was inferior to the behavioral performance of the animals, and thus suggests the presence of alternative coding strategies.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=184 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/187021v5_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e028e3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9c7475org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a1e922org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d0ddf8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Collective motions of epithelial cells in vivo are essential for morphogenesis in developmental biology. Tissues elongate, contract, flow, and oscillate, thus sculpting embryos. These tissue level dynamics are known, but the physical mechanisms at the cellular level are unclear, with various behaviors depending on the tissues and species. Moreover, investigations on in vitro tissue behavior usually focus on only one type of cell dynamics and use diverse theoretical approaches, making systematic comparisons between studies challenging. Here, we show that a single epithelial monolayer of Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells can exhibit two types of local tissue kinematics, pulsations and long range coherent flows. We analyzed these distinct motions by using quantitative live imaging. We also report that these motions can be controlled with internal and external cues such as specific inhibitors, and friction modulation of the substrate by microcontact printing method. We further demonstrate with a unified vertex model that both behaviors depend on the competition between velocity alignment and random diffusion of cell polarization. When alignment and diffusion are comparable, a pulsatile flow emerges, whereas the tissue undergoes long-range flows when velocity alignment dominates. We propose that environmental friction, acto-myosin distributions, and cell polarization kinetics are important in regulating the dynamics of tissue morphogenesis.",

We gAIRR-seqed TRV and TRJ of seven Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) DNA samples with 100% accuracy, and discovered novel alleles. We also gAIRR-seqed and gAIRR-called a subject from both the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and oral mucosal cells. The calling results from these two cell types have a high concordance (99% for all known AIRR alleles). We gAIRR-annotated 36 genomes to cumulatively unearth 325 novel TRV alleles and 29 novel TRJ alleles. We could further profile the flanking sequences, including the recombination signal sequence (RSS). We validated two structural variants for HG002. We uncovered substantial conflicts of AIRR genes in references GRCh37 and GRCh38.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer mortality remains unacceptably high, indicating a need for safer and more effective therapeutic agents. Disulfide bond Disrupting Agents (DDAs) were previously identified as a novel class of anticancer compounds that selectively kill cancers that overexpress the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) or its family member HER2. DDAs kill EGFR+ and HER2+ cancer cells via the parallel downregulation of EGFR, HER2, and HER3 and activation/oligomerization of Death Receptors 4 and 5 (DR4/5). However, the mechanisms by which DDAs mediate these effects are unknown. Affinity purification analyses employing biotinylated-DDAs reveal that the Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) family members AGR2, PDIA1, and ERp44 are DDA target proteins. Further analyses demonstrate that shRNA-mediated knockdown of AGR2 and ERp44, or expression of ERp44 mutants, enhance basal and DDA-induced DR5 oligomerization. DDA treatment of breast cancer cells disrupts PDIA1 and ERp44 mixed disulfide bonds with their client proteins. Together, the results herein reveal DDAs as the first small molecule, active site inhibitors of AGR2 and ERp44, and demonstrate roles for AGR2 and ERp44 in regulating the activity, stability, and localization of DR4 and DR5, and activation of Caspase 8.",

    "abstract": "Live birth is a key innovation that has evolved from egg laying ancestors over 100 times in reptiles. However, egg-laying lizards and snakes often possess preferred body temperatures that are lethal to developing embryos, which should select against egg retention. Here, we demonstrate that thermal mismatches between mothers and offspring are widespread across the squamate phylogeny. This mismatch is resolved by gravid females adjusting their body temperature towards the thermal optimum of embryos. Importantly, phylogenetic reconstructions suggest this thermoregulatory behaviour evolved in egg-laying species prior to the evolution of live birth. Maternal thermoregulatory behaviour therefore bypasses the constraints imposed by a slowly evolving thermal physiology and has likely been a key facilitator in the repeated transitions to live birth.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using a blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast is a common method for studying human brain function non-invasively. Gradient-echo (GRE) BOLD is highly sensitive to the blood oxygenation change in blood vessels; however, the spatial signal specificity can be degraded due to signal leakage from activated lower layers to superficial layers in depth-dependent (also called laminar or layer-specific) fMRI. Alternatively, physiological variables such as cerebral blood volume using the VAscular-Space-Occupancy (VASO) contrast have shown higher spatial specificity compared to BOLD. To better understand the physiological mechanisms such as blood volume and oxygenation changes and to interpret the measured depth-dependent responses, models are needed which reflect vascular properties at this scale. For this purpose, we extended and modified the \"cortical vascular model\" previously developed to predict layer-specific BOLD signal changes in human primary visual cortex to also predict a layer-specific VASO response. To evaluate the model, we compared the predictions with experimental results of simultaneous VASO and BOLD measurements in a group of healthy participants. Fitting the model to our experimental data provided an estimate of CBV change in different vascular compartments upon neural activity. We found that stimulus-evoked CBV change mainly occurs in small arterioles, capillaries and intracortical arteries, and that the contribution from venules and ICVs is small. Our results confirm that VASO is less susceptible to large vessel effects compared to BOLD, as blood volume changes in intracortical arteries did not substantially affect the resulting depth-dependent VASO profiles, whereas depth-dependent BOLD profiles showed a bias towards signal contributions from intracortical veins.",

    "abstract": "Many processes of biological diversification can simultaneously affect multiple evolutionary lineages. Examples include multiple members of a gene family diverging when a region of a chromosome is duplicated, multiple viral strains diverging at a \"super-spreading\" event, and a geological event fragmenting whole communities of species. It is difficult to test for patterns of shared divergences predicted by such processes, because all phylogenetic methods assume that lineages diverge independently. We introduce a Bayesian phylogenetic approach to relax the assumption of independent, bifurcating divergences by expanding the space of topologies to include trees with shared and multifurcating divergences. This allows us to jointly infer phylogenetic relationships, divergence times, and patterns of divergences predicted by processes of diversification that affect multiple evolutionary lineages simultaneously or lead to more than two descendant lineages. Using simulations, we find the new method accurately infers shared and multifurcating divergence events when they occur, and performs as well as current phylogenetic methods when divergences are independent and bifurcating. We apply our new approach to genomic data from two genera of geckos from across the Philippines to test if past changes to the islands landscape caused bursts of speciation. Unlike our previous analyses restricted to only pairs of gecko populations, we find evidence for patterns of shared divergences. By generalizing the space of phylogenetic trees in a way that is independent from the likelihood model, our approach opens many avenues for future research into processes of diversification across the life sciences.\n\nSignificance statementPhylogenetic models have long assumed that lineages diverge independently. Processes of diversification that are of interest in biogeography, epidemiology, and genome evolution, violate this assumption by affecting multiple evolutionary lineages. To relax the assumption of independent divergences and infer patterns of divergences predicted by such processes, we introduce a new way of conceptualizing, modeling, and inferring phylogenetic trees. We apply the new approach to genomic data from geckos distributed across the Philippines, and find support for patterns of shared divergences predicted by repeated fragmentation of the archipelago by interglacial rises in sea level.",

    "abstract": "Limbal stem cell (LSC) deficiency is a frequent and severe complication after chemical injury to the eye. Previous studies have assumed that this is mediated directly by the caustic agent. Here we show that LSC damage occurs through immune cell mediators, even without direct injury to LSCs. In particular, pH elevation in the anterior chamber (AC) causes acute uveal stress, release of inflammatory cytokines at the basal limbal tissue, and subsequent LSC loss. Peripheral CCR2+ CX3CR1- monocytes are the key mediators of LSC damage, through the upregulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) at the limbus. In contrast to peripherally-derived monocytes, CX3CR1+ CCR2- tissue-resident macrophages have a protective role and their depletion prior to injury exacerbates LSC loss and increases LSC vulnerability to TNF--mediated apoptosis independently of CCR2+ cell infiltration into the tissue. Consistently, repopulation of the tissue by new resident macrophages not only restores the protective M2-like phenotype of macrophages but also suppresses LSC loss after exposure to inflammatory signals. These findings may have clinical implication in patient with chemical burns.\n\nSignificanceLimbal stem cell (LSC) loss after chemical burn is a significant clinical problem that has long been thought to be the result of direct chemical injury. This study demonstrates the existence of competing inflammatory mechanism responsible for LSC death, mediated by infiltrating peripheral monocytes that antagonize and overcome the protective role of tissue-resident macrophages. Thus, enhancing the role of tissue-resident macrophages while suppressing that of infiltrating monocytes could be a novel therapeutic strategy for LSC survival.",

    "abstract": "Brain shift is an important obstacle to the application of image guidance during neurosurgical interventions. There has been a growing interest in intra-operative imaging to update the image-guided surgery systems. However, due to the innate limitations of the current imaging modalities, accurate brain shift compensation continues to be a challenging task. In this study, the application of intra-operative photoacoustic imaging and registration of the intra-operative photoacoustic with pre-operative MR images is proposed to compensate for brain deformation. Finding a satisfactory registration method is challenging due to the unpredictable nature of brain deformation. In this study, the co-sparse analysis model is proposed for photoacoustic -MR image registration, which can capture the interdependency of the two modalities. The proposed algorithm works based on the minimization of the mapping transform via a pair of analysis operators that are learned by the alternating direction method of multipliers. The method was evaluated using experimental phantom and ex-vivo data obtained from the mouse brain. The results of phantom data show about 63% improvement in target registration error in comparison with the commonly used normalized mutual information method. Results proved that intra-operative photoacoustic images could become a promising tool when the brain shift invalidated pre-operative MRI.",

Using a recently published phylogeny and an extensive morphological dataset, we explore the differences in phenotypic evolution between Socotran and continental taxa. Moreover, we reconstructed ancestral habitat occupancy to examine if ecological specialisation is correlated with morphological change, comparing phenotypic disparity and trait evolution between habitats. We found a heterogeneous outcome of island colonisation. Namely, only one of the three colonisation events resulted in a body size increase. However, in general, Socotran species do not present higher levels or rates of morphological diversification than continental groups. Instead, habitat specialisation explains better the body size and shape evolution in Pristurus. Particularly, the colonisation of ground habitats appears as the main driver of morphological change, producing the highest disparity and evolutionary rates. Additionally, arboreal species show very similar body size and head proportions. These results reveal a determinant role of ecological mechanisms in morphological evolution and corroborate the complexity of ecomorphological dynamics in continent-island systems.",

    "abstract": "The anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) form a nodal point within a distributed memory network. The conventional view of ATN function describes segregated efferents to different terminal regions. By contrast, we found that bifurcating neurons are common within the anteromedial nucleus (AM) of the ATN. A substantial proportion of AM neurons ([~]36% within a region of interest) showed collateral projections when one of two retrograde neurotracers, Cholera Toxin Subunit B (CTB) conjugated to either Alexa Fluor(R) 488 or 594, was placed in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) or dorsal subiculum (dSub). A marked degree of collateralization ([~]20% AM neurons) was also found when neurotracers were placed in mPFC and caudal retrosplenial cortex (cRSC); about 10% showed collaterals when the cRSC was paired with either dSub or vHF; the fewest (6%) was found for mPFC paired with the ventral hippocampal formation (vHF). A generally similar range of percentages of bifurcating neurons was found in the adjacent nucleus reuniens (Re). Evidence that AM neurons project simultaneously to many distantly-located structures provides a new perspective on ATN function. These neurons would facilitate direct coordination among key neural structures to support memory and may explain the strong association between the ATN and diencephalic amnesia.",

    "abstract": "Chemoproteomics has emerged as a key technology to expand the functional space in complex proteomes for probing fundamental biology and for discovering new small molecule-based therapies. Here we report a modification-centric computational tool termed pChem to provide a streamlined pipeline for unbiased performance assessment of chemoproteomic probes. The pipeline starts with an experimental setting for isotopically coding probe-derived modifications (PDMs) that can be automatically recognized by pChem, with masses accurately calculated and sites precisely localized. Further, pChem exports on-demand reports by scoring the profiling efficiency, modification-homogeneity and proteome-wide residue selectivity of a tested probe. The performance and robustness of pChem were benchmarked by applying it to eighteen bioorthogonal probes. Of note, the analyses reveal that the formation of unexpected PDMs can be driven by endogenous reactive metabolites (e.g., bioactive aldehydes and glutathione). Together, pChem is a powerful and user-friendly tool that aims to facilitate the development of probes for the ever-growing field of chemoproteomics.",

    "abstract": "Minimally invasive neuromodulation technologies seek to marry the neural selectivity of implantable devices with the low-cost and non-invasive nature of transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES). The Injectrode(R) is a needle-delivered electrode that is injected onto neural structures under image guidance. Power is then transcutaneously delivered to the Injectrode using surface electrodes. The Injectrode serves as a low-impedance conduit to guide current to the deep on-target nerve, reducing activation thresholds by an order of magnitude compared to using only surface stimulation electrodes. To minimize off-target recruitment of cutaneous fibers, the energy transfer efficiency from the surface electrodes to the Injectrode must be optimized.\n\nTES energy is transferred to the Injectrode through both capacitive and resistive mechanisms. Electrostatic finite element models generally used in TES research consider only the resistive means of energy transfer by defining tissue conductivities. Here, we present an electroquasistatic model, taking into consideration both the conductivity and permittivity of tissue, to understand transcutaneous power delivery to the Injectrode. The model was validated with measurements taken from (n=4) swine cadavers. We used the validated model to investigate system and anatomic parameters that influence the coupling efficiency of the Injectrode energy delivery system. Our work suggests the relevance of electroquasistatic models to account for capacitive charge transfer mechanisms when studying TES, particularly when high-frequency voltage components are present, such as those used for voltage-controlled pulses and sinusoidal nerve blocks.",

    "abstract": "Space is an extremely hostile environment. Traveling to space has numerous effects on the body of the astronauts at a molecular level. As space agencies prepare for long-term missions, it becomes important to investigate these problems and address them. Thus, in the current study, we assessed the impact of simulated microgravity on the basic pathways especially DNA damage response. We identified a total of 7542 significantly differentially expressed genes. Out of these genes, 4504 were found to be up-regulated while 3038 were down-regulated in the simulated microgravity group in comparison to controls. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that simulated microgravity has an effect on vital basic biological processes like DNA damage repair, peptide transport, and metabolism. To explore if the same pathways were also altered in humans, we explored the NASA twin study data and found that DDR was also significantly affected in the astronaut but due to ionizing radiation. Upon further investigation, we found that 62 genes belonging to the DDR pathway were mutually differentially expressed in Scott Kelly and the zebrafish embryos. However, there were 29 significantly differentially expressed genes belonging to the DDR pathway in zebrafish embryos that were not found to be differentially expressed in Scott Kelly. Out of these 29 genes, 14 were specific to zebrafish. Upon further investigation, we found that the DDR pathway is affected differently in simulated microgravity as compared to ionizing radiation. These observations provide a preliminary look into the difference in DDR induced by the different factors of spaceflight.",

Here, we show that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) significantly attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome activation in murine and human macrophages and septic mice by lowering caspase-1 cleavage and IL-1{beta} secretion. Inhibiting PDHK reverses NLRP3 inflammasome-induced metabolic reprogramming, enhances autophagy, promotes mitochondrial fusion over fission, preserves cristae ultrastructure, and attenuates mitochondrial ROS production. The suppressive effect of PDHK inhibition on the NLRP3 inflammasome is independent of its canonical role as a pyruvate dehydrogenase regulator. We suggest that PDHK inhibition improves mitochondrial fitness by reversing NLRP3 inflammasome activation in acutely inflamed macrophages.",

With viral tracing, we show dense cerebellar and cerebral cortical afferent input to the VPM. Lidocaine microinfusions into the cerebellar nuclei selectively block seizure initiation. We perform single-unit electrophysiology recordings during awake, convulsive seizures to define the local activity of thalamic neurons before, during, and after seizure onset. We find highly dynamic activity with biphasic properties, raising the possibility that heterogenous activity patterns promote seizures.

How secondary structure in the pre-mRNA transcripts affects recognition by RBPs and determines alternative exon usage is poorly understood. The MALT1 paracaspase is a key component of signaling pathways that mediate innate and adaptive immune responses 4. Alternative splicing of MALT1 exon7 is critical for controlling optimal T cell activation 5,6. Here, we demonstrate that processing of the MALT1 pre-mRNA depends on RNA structural elements that shield the 5 and 3 splice sites of the alternatively spliced exon7. By combining biochemical analyses with chemical probing and NMR we show that the RBPs hnRNP U and hnRNP L bind competitively and with comparable affinities to identical stem-loop RNA structures flanking the 5 and 3 splice sites of MALT1 exon7. While hnRNP U stabilizes RNA stem-loop conformations that maintain exon7 skipping, hnRNP L unwinds these RNA elements to facilitate recruitment of the essential splicing factor U2AF2 to promote exon7 inclusion. Our data represent a paradigm for the control of splice site selection by differential RBP binding and modulation of pre-mRNA structure.",

Combining optogenetics, deep learning-based image analysis and mathematical modeling, we find that decoding of TF dynamics occurs only when the coupling between TF binding and transcription pre-initiation complex formation is inefficient and that the ability of a promoter to decode TF dynamics gets amplified by inefficient translation initiation. Furthermore, we propose a theoretical mechanism based on phase separation that would allow a promoter to be activated better by pulsatile than sustained TF signals. These results provide an understanding on how TF dynamics are decoded in mammalian cells, which is important to develop optimal strategies to counteract disease conditions, and suggest ways to achieve multiplexing in synthetic pathways.",

    "abstract": "As neurons are often born at positions different than where they ultimately function, neuronal migration is key to ensure successful nervous system development. Radial migration during which neurons featuring unipolar and bipolar morphology, employ pre-existing processes or underlying cells for directional guidance, is the most well explored neuronal migration mode. However, how neurons that display multipolar morphology, without such processes, move through highly crowded tissue environments towards their final positions remains elusive. To understand this, we here investigated multipolar migration of horizontal cells in the zebrafish retina. We found that horizontal cells tailor their movements to the environmental spatial constraints of the crowded retina, by featuring several characteristics of amoeboid migration. These include cell and nucleus shape changes, and persistent rearward polarization of stable F-actin, which enable horizontal cells to successfully move through the crowded retina. Interference with the organization of the developing retina by changing nuclear properties or overall tissue architecture, hampers efficient horizontal cell migration and layer formation. Thus, cell-tissue interplay is crucial for efficient migration of horizontal cells in the retina. In view of high proportion of multipolar neurons, the here uncovered ameboid-like neuronal migration mode might also be crucial in other areas of the developing brain.",

We assayed for persistence and resistance with three clinically relevant antibiotics: meropenem, ciprofloxacin and tobramycin, in isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from chronic cystic fibrosis lung infections spanning up to forty years of evolution. We find evidence that persistence is under positive selection in the lung and that it can particularly act as an evolutionary stepping stone to resistance.

    "abstract": "The availability of validated biomarkers to assess radiation exposure and to assist in developing medical countermeasures remains an unmet need. We used a cobalt-60 gamma-irradiated nonhuman primate (NHP) model to delineate a multi-omics-based serum probability index of radiation exposure. Both male and female NHPs were irradiated with different doses ranging from 6.0 to 8.5 Gy, with 0.5 Gy increments between doses. We leveraged high resolution mass spectrometry for analysis of metabolites, lipids, and proteins at 1,2, and 6 days post-irradiation in NHP serum. A logistic regression model was implemented to develop a 4-analyte panel to stratify irradiated NHPs from unirradiated with high accuracy that was agnostic for all doses of {gamma}-rays tested in the study, up to six days after exposure. This panel was comprised of Serpin Family A9, acetylcarnitine, PC (16:0/22:6), and suberylglycine, which showed 2 - 4-fold elevation in serum abundance upon irradiation in NHPs, and can potentially be translated for human use following larger validation studies. Taken together, this study, for the first time, demonstrates the utility of a combinatorial molecular characterization approach using an NHP model for developing minimally invasive assays from small volumes of blood that can be effectively used for radiation exposure assessments.",

    "abstract": "Structures of two globular proteins were determined ab initio using microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) data that was collected on a direct electron detector in counting mode. Microcrystals were identified using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and thinned with a focused ion-beam (FIB) to produce crystalline lamellae of ideal thickness. Continuous rotation data were collected using an ultra-low exposure rate on a Falcon 4 direct electron detector in electron-counting mode. For the first sample, triclinic lysozyme extending to 0.87 [A] resolution, an ideal helical fragment of only three alanine residues provided initial phases. These phases were improved using density modification, allowing the entire atomic structure to be built automatically. A similar approach was successful on a second macromolecular sample, proteinase K, which is much larger and diffracted to a modest 1.5 [A] resolution. These results demonstrate that macromolecules can be determined to sub-[A]ngstrom resolution by MicroED and that ab initio phasing can be successfully applied to counting data collected on a direct electron detector.",

    "abstract": "Non-productive adsorption of cellulolytic enzymes to various plant cell wall components, such as lignin and cellulose, necessitates high enzyme loadings to achieve efficient conversion of pretreated lignocellulosic biomass to fermentable sugars. Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), appended to various catalytic domains (CDs), promote lignocellulose deconstruction by increasing targeted substrate-bound CD concentration but often at the cost of increased non-productive enzyme binding. Here, we demonstrate how a computational protein design strategy can be applied to a model endocellulase enzyme (Cel5A) from Thermobifida fusca to allow fine-tuning its CBM surface charge, which led to increased hydrolytic activity towards pretreated lignocellulosic biomass (e.g., corn stover) by up to [~]330% versus the wild-type Cel5A control. We established that the mechanistic basis for this improvement arises from reduced non-productive binding of supercharged Cel5A mutants to cell wall components such as crystalline cellulose (up to 1.7-fold) and lignin (up to 1.8-fold). Interestingly, supercharged Cel5A mutants that showed improved activity on various forms of pretreated corn stover showed increased reversible binding to lignin (up to 2.2-fold) while showing no change in overall thermal stability remarkably. In general, negative supercharging led to increased hydrolytic activity towards both pretreated lignocellulosic biomass and crystalline cellulose whereas positive supercharging led to a reduction of hydrolytic activity. Overall, selective supercharging of protein surfaces was shown to be an effective strategy for improving hydrolytic performance of cellulolytic enzymes for saccharification of real-world pretreated lignocellulosic biomass substrates. Future work should address the implications of supercharging cellulases from various families on inter-enzyme interactions and synergism.",

    "abstract": "Nearest neighbor parameters for estimating the folding stability of RNA secondary structures are in widespread use. For helices, current parameters penalize terminal AU base pairs relative to terminal GC base pairs. We curated an expanded database of helix stabilities determined by optical melting experiments. Analysis of the updated database shows that terminal penalties depend on the sequence identity of the adjacent penultimate base pair. New nearest neighbor parameters that include this additional sequence dependence accurately predict the measured values of 271 helices in an updated database with a correlation coefficient of 0.982. This refined understanding of helix ends facilitates fitting terms for base pair stacks with GU pairs. Prior parameter sets treated [Formula] separately from other [Formula] stacks. The improved understanding of helix end stability, however, makes the separate treatment unnecessary. Introduction of the additional terms was tested with three optical melting experiments. The average absolute difference between measured and predicted free energy changes at 37{degrees} C for these three duplexes containing terminal adjacent AU and GU pairs improved from 1.38 to 0.27 kcal/mol. This confirms the need for the additional sequence dependence in the model.",

    "abstract": "While critical for neurotransmitter synthesis in the brain, members of the 14-3-3 protein family are often assumed to have redundant, over-lapping roles due to their high sequence homology and ubiquitous expression. Despite this assumption, various mammalian 14-3-3 isoforms have now been implicated in regulating cellular and organismal metabolism; however, these functions were primarily observed in cell lines or from systemic knockout mouse models. To date, we have begun to define the contributions of 14-3-3{zeta} in adipocytes, but whether 14-3-3{zeta} has additional metabolic roles in other cell types, such as the pancreatic {beta}-cell, is unclear. We previously documented a pro-survival role of 14-3-3{zeta} in MIN6 insulinoma cells, as depletion of 14-3-3{zeta} induced cell death, but paradoxically, whole-body deletion of 14-3-3{zeta} in mice resulted in significantly enlarged {beta}-cell area with no effects on insulin secretion. To better understand the role of 14-3-3{zeta} in {beta}-cells, we generated {beta}-cell-specific 14-3-3{zeta} knockout ({beta}14-3-3{zeta}KO) mice, and while no differences in {beta}-cell mass were observed, {beta}14-3-3{zeta}KO mice displayed potentiated insulin secretion due to enhanced mitochondrial function and ATP synthesis. Deletion of 14-3-3{zeta} led to profound changes to the {beta}-cell transcriptome, where pathways associated with mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation were upregulated. Acute treatment of mouse islets and human islets with pan-14-3-3 inhibitors recapitulated the potentiation in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and mitochondrial function, suggesting that 14-3-3{zeta} is a critical isoform in {beta}-cells that regulates GSIS. In dysfunctional db/db islets and islets from type 2 diabetic donors, expression of Ywhaz/YWHAZ, the gene encoding 14-3-3{zeta}, was inversely associated with insulin secretory capacity, and pan-14-3-3 protein inhibition was capable of enhancing GSIS and mitochondrial function. Taken together, this study demonstrates important regulatory functions of 14-3-3{zeta} and its related isoforms in insulin secretion and mitochondrial function in {beta}-cells. A deeper understanding of how 14-3-3{zeta} influences {beta}-cell function will further advance our knowledge of how insulin secretion from {beta}-cells is regulated.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine released from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) neurons modulates movement, motivation, and reward. In addition to their tonic firing pattern, dopamine neurons also fire high-frequency bursts that cause superlinear increases in dopamine release. To study this poorly understood form of short-term plasticity, we used the fluorescent dopamine sensor dLight1.3b to examine the role of the calcium-binding protein synaptotagmin-7 (SYT7). We report that SYT7 mediates a hidden component of facilitation, which was unmasked by lowering initial release probability, or by low-frequency stimulation of nerve terminals. In Syt7 KO neurons, there was profound synaptic depression that significantly reduced release during stimulations that mimic in vivo firing patterns of SNc neurons. D2-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the SNc revealed a similar role for SYT7 in somatodendritic release. Our results indicate that SYT7 drives short-term facilitation of release from dopamine neurons, which likely underlies frequency-dependence of dopamine signaling in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Trigeminal neurons supply somatosensation to craniofacial tissues. In mouse brain, ascending projections from medullary trigeminal neurons arrive at taste neurons in the autonomic parabrachial nucleus, suggesting taste neurons participate in somatosensory processing. However, the genetic cell types that support this convergence were undefined. Using Cre-directed optogenetics and in vivo neurophysiology in anesthetized mice of both sexes, here we studied whether TRPV1-lineage nociceptive and thermosensory fibers are primary neurons that drive trigeminal circuits reaching parabrachial taste cells. We monitored spiking activity in individual parabrachial neurons during photoexcitation of the terminals of TRPV1-lineage fibers that arrived at the dorsal spinal trigeminal nucleus pars caudalis, which relays orofacial somatosensory messages to the parabrachial area. Parabrachial neural responses to oral delivery of taste, chemesthetic, and thermal stimuli were also recorded. We found that optical excitation of TRPV1-lineage fibers frequently stimulated traditionally defined taste neurons in lateral parabrachial nuclei. The tuning of neurons across diverse tastes associated with their sensitivity to excitation of TRPV1-lineage fibers, which only sparingly engaged neurons oriented to preferred tastes like sucrose. Moreover, neurons that responded to photostimulation of TRPV1-lineage afferents showed strong responses to temperature including noxious heat, which predominantly excited parabrachial bitter taste cells. Multivariate analyses revealed the parabrachial confluence of TRPV1-lineage signals with taste captured sensory valence information shared across aversive gustatory, nociceptive, and thermal stimuli. Our results reveal that trigeminal fibers with defined roles in thermosensation and pain communicate with parabrachial taste neurons.\n\nThis multisensory convergence supports dependencies between gustatory and somatosensory hedonic representations in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Microbes are social organisms that commonly live in sessile biofilms. Spatial patterns of populations within biofilms can be an important determinant of community-level properties. The best-studied characteristics of spatial patterns is spatial intermixing of different populations. The specific levels of spatial intermixing critically contribute to how the dynamics and functioning of such communities are governed. However, the precise factors that determine spatial patterns and intermixing remain unclear. Here, we investigated the spatial patterning and intermixing of an engineered synthetic consortium composed of two Pseudomonas stutzeri strains that degrade salicylate via metabolic cross-feeding. We found that the consortium self-organizes across space to form a previously unreported spatial pattern (referred to here as a  bubble-jet pattern) that exhibits a low level of intermixing. Interestingly, when the genes encoding for type IV pili were deleted from both strains, a highly intermixed spatial pattern developed and increased the productivity of the entire community. The intermixed pattern was maintained in a robust manner across a wide range of initial ratios between the two strains. Our findings show that the type IV pilus plays a role in mitigating spatial intermixing of different populations in surface-attached microbial communities, with consequences for governing community-level properties. These insights provide tangible clues for the engineering of synthetic microbial systems that perform highly in spatially structured environments.\n\nImportanceWhen growing on surfaces, multi-species microbial communities form biofilms that exhibit intriguing spatial patterns. These patterns can significantly affect the overall properties of the community, such as enabling otherwise impermissible metabolic functions to occur, as well as driving the evolutionary and ecological processes acting on communities. The development of these patterns is affected by several drivers, including cell-cell interactions, nutrient levels, density of founding cells and surface properties. The type IV pilus is commonly found to mediate surface-associated behaviors of microorganism, but its role on pattern formation within microbial communities is unclear. Here we report that in a cross-feeding consortium, the type IV pilus affects the spatial intermixing of interacting populations involved in pattern formation, and ultimately influences overall community productivity and robustness. This novel insight assists our understanding of the ecological processes of surface-attached microbial communities and suggests a potential strategy to engineer high-performance synthetic microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "There is an unmet need for delivery platforms that realize the full potential of next-generation therapeutic and vaccine technologies, especially those that require intracellular delivery of nucleic acids. The in vivo usefulness of the current state-of-the-art delivery systems is limited by numerous intrinsic weaknesses, including lack of targeting specificity, inefficient entry and endosomal escape into target cells, undesirable immune activation, off-target effects, a small therapeutic window, limited genetic encoding and cargo capacity, and manufacturing challenges. Here we present our characterization of a delivery platform based on the use of engineered live, tissue-targeting, non-pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli strain SVC1) for intracellular cargo delivery. The SVC1 bacteria are engineered to specifically bind to epithelial cells via a surface-expressed targeting ligand, to escape the endosome upon intracellularization, and to have minimal immunogenicity. Here we report findings on key features of this system. First, we demonstrated that bacterial delivery of a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) can target and silence a gene in an in vitro mammalian respiratory cell model. Next, we used an in vivo mouse model to demonstrate that SVC1 bacteria are invasive to epithelial cells of various tissues and organs (eye, nose, mouth, stomach, vagina, skeletal muscle, and lungs) via local administration. We also showed that repeat dosing of SVC1 bacteria to the lungs is minimally immunogenic and that it does not have adverse effects on tissue homeostasis. Finally, to validate the potential of SVC1 bacteria in therapeutic applications, we demonstrated that bacterial delivery of influenza-targeting shRNAs to the respiratory tissues can mitigate viral replication in a mouse model of influenza infection. Our ongoing work is focused on further refining this platform for efficient delivery of nucleic acids, gene editing machinery, and therapeutic proteins, and we expect that this platform technology will enable a wide range of advanced therapeutic approaches.",

Live-cell fluorescence microscopy showed natively expressed ESX-1 was organized into distinct foci predominantly observed at cell-cell contacts. These foci formed when two cells touched and required a fully assembled ESX-1 system in both bacteria, suggesting the generation of an ESX-1 megacomplex across multiple membranes. The emergence of ESX-1 foci and ESX-1 secretion was environmentally dependent: foci formed in low nitrogen environments in which secretion was suppressed, yet with increasing concentrations of nitrogen, ESX-1 systems diffused along the plasma membrane and secretion was activated. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling revealed ESX-1 dependent induction of genes required for the SOS response and error prone DNA replication in high nitrogen. Based on these findings, we propose a new model of ESX-1 function where ESX-1 localization and secretion are responsive to nitrogen levels and form an integral node in the mycobacterial response to neighboring cells and environmental adaptation.",

Mutations in the Tuberin gene, TSC2, lead to the formation of tumors and developmental defects in many organ systems, including the central nervous system. Tuberin is expressed in the brain throughout development and levels of Tuberin have been found to decrease during neuronal differentiation in cell lines in vitro. Our current work investigates the levels of Tuberin at two stages of embryonic development in vivo, and we study the mRNA and protein levels during a time course using immortalized cell lines in vitro. Our results show that Tuberin levels remain stable in the olfactory bulb but decrease in the Purkinje cell layer during embryonic mouse brain development. We show here that Tuberin levels are higher when cells are cultured as neurospheres, and knockdown of Tuberin results in a reduction in the number of neurospheres. These data provide support for the hypothesis that Tuberin is an important regulator of stemness and the reduction of Tuberin levels might support functional differentiation in the central nervous system.

    "abstract": "ObjectivesHair (i.e., pelage/fur) is a salient feature of primate (including human) diversity and evolution-- serving functions tied to thermoregulation, protection, camouflage, and signaling--but wild primate pelage evolution remains relatively understudied. Specifically, assessing multiple hypotheses across distinct phylogenetic scales is essential but is rarely conducted. We examine whole body hair color and density variation across Indriidae (Avahi, Indri, Propithecus)--a lineage that, like humans, exhibits vertical posture (i.e., their whole bodies are vertical to the sun).\n\nMaterials and MethodsOur analyses consider multiple phylogenetic scales (family-level, genus-level) and hypotheses (e.g., Glogers rule, the body cooling hypotheses). We obtain hair color and density from museum and/or wild animals, opsin genotypes from wild animals, and climate data from WorldClim. To analyze our data, we use phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models (PGLMM) using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms.\n\nResultsOur results show that across the Indriidae family, darker hair is typical in wetter regions. However, within Propithecus, dark black hair is common in colder forest regions. Results also show pelage redness increases in populations exhibiting enhanced color vision. Lastly, we find follicle density on the crown and limbs increases in dry and open environments.\n\nDiscussionThis study highlights how different selective pressures across distinct phylogenetic scales have likely acted on primate hair evolution. Specifically, our data across Propithecus may implicate thermoregulation and is the first empirical evidence of Bogerts rule in mammals. Our study also provides rare empirical evidence supporting an early hypothesis on hominin hair evolution.",

    "abstract": "The soil-dwelling nematode Caenorhabditis elegans serves as a model system to study innate immunity against microbial pathogens. C. elegans have been collected from around the world, where they, presumably, adapted to regional microbial ecologies. Here we use survival assays and RNA- sequencing to better understand how two isolates from disparate climates respond to pathogenic bacteria. We found that, relative to N2 (originally isolated in Bristol, UK), CB4856 (isolated in Hawaii), was more susceptible to the Gram-positive pathogen, Staphylococcus epidermidis, but equally susceptible to Staphylococcus aureus as well as two Gram-negative pathogens, Providencia rettgeri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We performed transcriptome analysis of infected worms and found gene- expression profiles were considerably different in an isolate-specific and pathogen-specific manner. We performed GO term analysis to categorize differential gene expression in response to S. epidermidis. In N2, genes that encoded detoxification enzymes and extracellular matrix proteins were significantly enriched, while in CB4856, genes that encoded detoxification enzymes, C-type lectins, and lipid metabolism proteins were enriched, suggesting they have different responses to these bacterial pathogens, despite being the same species. Overall, discerning gene expression signatures in an isolate by pathogen manner can help us to understand the different possibilities for the evolution of immune responses within organisms.",

    "abstract": "Many highly-eusocial insect species are characterized by morphological differences between females. This is especially pronounced in ants where queens usually possess a fully developed thorax with wings and are specialized for reproduction while workers have a reduced thorax without wings and show various levels of reproductive degeneration that is associated with their helper role in the colony. Despite their morphological differentiation, queens and workers still show some plasticity leading to overlapping behavioral and physiological phenotypes. We investigated the level of queen plasticity and the factor that induces a worker-like phenotype in the ant species Harpegnathos saltator that has limited queen-worker dimorphism and workers that can assume the reproductive role of a queen in the colony. By comparing alate and dealate young queens, so-called gynes, we found that the loss of wings initiated the expression of behavioral and physiological characteristics of ant workers. In contrast to alate gynes, dealate gynes displayed higher frequencies of worker-like behaviors. In addition, dealate gynes showed a worker-like range of reproductive states unlike alate gynes. Like workers, dealate gynes lost the chemical signaling that is characteristic of alate gynes. Since gynes can activate this worker-like phenotype after wing loss, the essential difference between the ant queens and workers in this species with limited queen-worker dimorphism is a dispersal polyphenism. If the phenotypic plasticity observed in H. saltator is representative of the early stages of ant eusociality, an emerging dispersal dimorphism rather than a distinct reproductive dimorphism might represent one of the first steps in ant evolution.\n\nSummary StatementAnt queens who have lost their wings express worker-like behaviors and physiology including the display of dominance behavior during hierarchy establishment, which is normally a worker-only behavior in this species.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can lead to mutations, chromosomal rearrangements, genome instability, and ultimately cancer. Central to the sensing of DSBs are ATM (Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) kinase, which belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK) family, and the MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) protein complex that activates ATM. How the MRN complex recruits and activates ATM kinase is poorly understood. Previous studies indicate that the FxF/Y motif of Nbs1 directly binds to ATM kinase and is required to retain active ATM at sites of DNA damage. Here, we report the 2.5 [A] resolution cryo-EM structures of human ATM and its complex with the Nbs1 FxF/Y motif. In keeping with previous structures of ATM and its yeast homolog Tel1, the dimeric human ATM kinase adopts a symmetric, butterfly-shaped autoinhibited structure. The conformation of the ATM kinase domain is most similar to the inactive states of other PIKKs, suggesting that activation may involve an analogous realigning the N and C lobes along with relieving the blockage of the substrate-binding site. We show that the Nbs1 FxF/Y motif binds to a conserved hydrophobic cleft within the Spiral domain of ATM, suggesting an allosteric mechanism of activation. We evaluate the importance of these interactions with mutagenesis and biochemical assays.",

    "abstract": "Alkylation of DNA and RNA is a potentially toxic lesion that can result in mutations and cell death. In response to alkylation damage, K63-linked polyubiquitin chains are assembled that localize the ALKBH3-ASCC repair complex to damage sites in the nucleus. The protein ASCC2, a subunit of the ASCC complex, selectively binds K63-linked polyubiquitin chains using its CUE domain, a type of ubiquitin-binding domain that typically binds monoubiquitin and does not discriminate among different polyubiquitin linkage types. We report here that the ASCC2 CUE domain selectively binds K63-linked diubiquitin by contacting both the distal and proximal ubiquitin. Whereas the ASCC2 CUE domain binds the distal ubiquitin in a manner similar to that reported for other CUE domains bound to a single ubiquitin, the contacts with the proximal ubiquitin are unique to ASCC2. The N-terminal portion of the ASCC2 1 helix, including residues E467 and S470, contributes to the binding interaction with the proximal ubiquitin of K63-linked diubiquitin. Mutation of residues within the N-terminal portion of the ASCC2 1 helix decreases ASCC2 recruitment in response to DNA alkylation, supporting the functional significance of these interactions during the alkylation damage response.",

    "abstract": "Tranexamic Acid (TA) is a clinically used antifibrinolytic that acts as a lysine mimetic to block binding of Plasminogen with Plasminogen activators, preventing conversion of Plasminogen to its proteolytically activated form, Plasmin. Previous studies suggested that TA may exhibit anticancer activity by blockade of extracellular Plasmin formation. Plasmin-mediated cleavage of the CDCP1 protein may increase its oncogenic functions through several downstream pathways. Results presented herein demonstrate that TA blocks Plasmin-mediated excision of the extracellular domain of the oncoprotein CDCP1. In vitro studies indicate that TA reduces the viability of a broad array of human and murine cancer cell lines, and breast tumor growth studies demonstrate that TA reduces cancer growth in vivo. Based on the ability of TA to mimic lysine and arginine, we hypothesized that TA may perturb multiple processes that involve Lys/Arg-rich protein sequences, and that TA may alter intracellular signaling pathways in addition to blocking extracellular Plasmin production. Indeed, TA-mediated suppression of tumor cell viability is associated with multiple biochemical actions, including inhibition of protein synthesis, reduced activating phosphorylation of STAT3 and S6K1, decreased expression of the MYC oncoprotein, and suppression of Lys acetylation. These findings suggest that TA or TA analogs may serve as lead compounds and inspire the production of new classes of anticancer agents that function by mimicking Lys and Arg.",

    "abstract": "How cell size and number are determined during organ development remains a fundamental question in cell biology. Here, we identified a GRAS family transcription factor, called SCARECROW-LIKE28 (SCL28), with a critical role in determining cell size in Arabidopsis. SCL28 is part of a transcriptional regulatory network downstream of the central MYB3Rs that regulate G2 to M phase cell cycle transition. We show that SCL28 forms a dimer with the AP2-type transcription factor, AtSMOS1, which defines the specificity for promoter binding and directly activates transcription of a specific set of SIAMESE-RELATED (SMR) family genes, encoding plant-specific inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases and thus inhibiting cell cycle progression at G2 and promoting the onset of endoreplication. Through this dose-dependent regulation of SMR transcription, SCL28 quantitatively sets the balance between cell size and number without dramatically changing final organ size. We propose that this hierarchical transcriptional network constitutes a cell cycle regulatory mechanism that allows to adjust cell size and number to attain robust organ growth.",

We use a neutral stochastic model to examine the demographic patterns that emerge over time, across a range of population sizes and empirically observed mortality rates. A small proportion of trees ([~]1% at 1.5% mortality) are life-history  lottery winners, achieving ages >10-20x median age. Maximum age increases with bigger populations and lower mortality rates. One quarter of trees ([~]24%) achieve ages that are 3-4 times greater than median age. Three age classes (Mature, Old, and Ancient) contribute unique historical diversity across complex environmental cycles. Ancient trees are an emergent property of forests that requires many centuries to generate. They rradically change generation time variance and population fitness, bridging infrequent environmental cycles. These life-history  lottery winners are vital to future forest dynamics and invaluable data about environmental history and individual longevity. Old-growth forests contain trees that cannot be replaced through restoration or regeneration in the near future. They simply must be protected to preserve their unique diversity.",

    "abstract": "Excess excitation energy in the light-harvesting antenna of Photosystem II (PSII) can cause irreversible damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. In periods of high light intensity, a feedback mechanism known as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), induces the formation of quenchers which can safely dissipate excess excitation energy as heat. Although quenchers have been identified in more than one compartment of the PSII supercomplex, there is currently no quantitative description of how much NPQ is occurring at each of these locations. Here, we perform time-resolved fluorescence measurements on WT and antenna mutants lacking LHCII (NoL) and all peripheral antenna (Ch1 and Ch1lhcb5). By combining the results with those of steady-state fluorescence experiments we are able to estimate the intrinsic rate of NPQ for each plant and each PSII compartment. It is concluded that 60-70% of quenching occurs in LHCII, 15-20% in the minor antenna and 15-20% in the PSII core.",

    "abstract": "Individual cells direct non-equilibrium processes through coordinated signal transduction and gene expression, allowing for dynamic control over multicellular, system-wide behavior. This behavior extends to remodeling the extracellular polymer matrix that encases biofilms and tissues, where constituent cells dictate spatiotemporal network properties including stiffness, pattern formation, and transport properties. The majority of synthetic polymer networks cannot recreate these phenomena due to their lack of autonomous centralized actuators (i.e., cells). In addition, non-living polymer networks that perform computation are generally restricted to a few inputs (e.g., light, pH, enzymes), limiting the logical complexity available to a single network chemistry. Toward synergizing the advantages of living and synthetic systems, engineered living materials leverage genetic and metabolic programming to establish control over material-wide properties. Here we demonstrate that a bacterial metal respiration mechanism, extracellular electron transfer (EET), can control metal-catalyzed radical cross-linking of polymer networks. Linking metabolic electron flux to a synthetic redox catalyst allows dynamic, tunable, and predictable control over material formation and bulk polymer network mechanics using genetic circuits. By programming key EET genes with transcriptional Boolean logic, we rationally design computational networks that sense-and-respond to multiple inputs in biological contexts. Finally, we capitalize on the wide reactivity of EET and redox catalyses to predictably control another class of living synthetic materials using copper(I) alkyne-azide cycloaddition click chemistry. Our results demonstrate the utility of EET as a bridge for controlling abiotic materials and how the design rules of synthetic biology can be applied to emulate physiological behavior in polymer networks.",

    "abstract": "Camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora (L.) J. Presl), a species in the magnoliid family Lauraceae, is known for its rich volatile oils and is used as a medical cardiotonic and as a scent in many perfumed hygiene products. Here, we present a high-quality chromosome-scale genome of C. camphora with a scaffold N50 of 64.34 Mb and an assembled genome size of 755.41 Mb. Phylogenetic inference revealed that the magnoliids are a sister group to the clade of eudicots and monocots. Comparative genomic analyses identified two rounds of ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD). Tandem duplicated genes exhibited a higher evolutionary rate, a more recent evolutionary history and a more clustered distribution on chromosomes, contributing to the production of secondary metabolites, especially monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, which are the principal essential oil components. Three-dimensional analyses of the volatile metabolites, gene expression and climate data of samples with the same genotype grown in different locations showed that low temperature and low precipitation during the cold season modulate the expression of genes in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathways, especially TPS genes, which facilitates the accumulation of volatile compounds. Our study lays a theoretical foundation for policy-making regarding the agroforestry applications of camphor tree.",

    "abstract": "The abnormality of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (BK channels) is an important factor in inducing vascular inflammation. BK channel agonists can readily recover BK channel function and improve vascular inflammation. However, it is not clear how to improve BK dysfunction caused by downregulation of BK channel protein expression. This study found that angiotensin II-1 receptor autoantibodies (AT1-AA), which are widely present in the body of various types of cardiovascular diseases, can down-regulate the expression of BK channel protein and induce vascular inflammation. Further research found that the elevated neural precursor cells expressed developmentally downregulated 4-like (NEDD4L) protein level is involved in the down-regulation of BK channel  subunit (BK) protein level by AT1-AA. Bioinformatics analysis and experiments have confirmed that miR-339-3p plays an irreplaceable role in the high expression of NEDD4L and the low expression of BK, and aggravates the vascular inflammation induced by AT1-AA. Overall, AT1-AA increased miR-339-3p expression (targeting BK via the miR-339-3p/NEDD4L axis or miR-339-3p alone), reduced BK protein expression in VSMCs, and induced vascular inflammation. The results of the study indicate that miR-339-3p may become a new target for reversing vascular inflammation in AT1-AA-positive patients.",

    "abstract": "The Gram-negative bacterium Xylella fastidiosa colonizes plant xylem vessels and is obligately vectored by xylem sap-feeding hemipteran insects. X. fastidiosa causes diseases in many plant species but in a variety of its plant hosts this bacterium behaves as a commensal endophyte. Originally confined to the Americas, infecting mainly grapevine, citrus and coffee plants, X. fastidiosa has spread to several plant species in Europe, causing devastating crop diseases. Although many pathogenicity and virulence factors have been identified in X. fastidiosa which enable the bacterium to successfully establish in the xylem tissue, the mechanisms by which distinct X. fastidiosa strains colonize and cause disease in specific plant hosts have not been fully elucidated. Here we present comparative analyses of 94 publicly available whole-genome sequences of X. fastidiosa strains with the goal of providing insights into plant host specificity determinants for this phytopathogen as well as of expanding the knowledge of its mobile genetic elements (MGE) content, mainly prophages. Our results revealed a pangenome of 4,549 protein coding sequences (CDSs) which is still open. The core- and accessory genomes comprise 954 and 2,219 CDSs, respectively. Phylogenetic tree construction using all core genome CDSs grouped the strains in three major clades of subspecies fastidiosa, multiplex and pauca, with subclades related to the strains sequence type (ST) obtained from multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). The geographic region where the strains were collected showed stronger association with the clades of X. fastidiosa strains rather than the plant species from which they were isolated. Among the CDS related to virulence and pathogenicity found in the core genome, those related to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis and trimeric autotransporter adhesins (TAA) are somewhat related with the plant host of a given strain according to phylogenetic inference. The X. fastidiosa accessory genome is represented by an abundant and heterogeneous mobilome, which includes a diversity of prophage regions. In summary, the genome comparisons reported here will enable a better understanding of the diversity of phylogenetically close genomes and warrant further investigation of LPS and TAAs as potential X. fastidiosa host-specificity determinants.\n\nImpact statementThe bacterium Xylella fastidiosa is a pathogen that infects many plant species and has caused devastating diseases in grapevine, citrus, coffee, and olive plants. This phytopathogen X. fastidiosa is original from the Americas and has emerged in Europe where it is causing severe economic losses for olive producers, mainly in Italy. Although many pathogenicity and virulence factors have been identified in X. fastidiosa, which enable this bacterium to successfully establish in the xylem vessels network, the mechanisms by which distinct X. fastidiosa strains colonize and cause disease in the different plant host species have not been fully elucidated. The comparative analyses of 94 whole-genome sequences from X. fastidiosa strains from diverse hosts and geographic regions provide insights into host specificity determinants for this phytopathogen as well as expand the knowledge of its mobile genetic elements (MGE) content, mainly prophages. Our results contribute for a better understanding of the diversity of phylogenetically close genomes and warrant further experimental investigation of lipopolysaccharide and trimeric autotransporter adhesins as potential host-specificity determinants for X. fastidiosa.\n\nData summaryAll genomic sequences were accessed from publicly available GenBank RefSeq database at NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information). A full listing of NCBI accession numbers for X. fastidiosa strains described in this paper is available in Table S1 (available in the online version of this article).",

    "abstract": "One emerging paradigm of cellular organization of RNA and RNA binding proteins is the formation of membraneless organelles (MLOs). Examples of MLOs include several types of ribonucleoprotein granules that form via phase separation. A variety of intracellular pH changes and post-translational modifications, as well as extracellular stresses can stimulate the condensation of proteins into granules. For example, the assembly of stress granules induced by oxidative stress, osmotic stress, and heat stress has been well-characterized in a variety of somatic cell types. In the germ line, similar stress-induced condensation of proteins occurs; however, less is known about the role of phase separation during gamete production. Researchers who study phase transitions often make use of fluorescent reporters to study the dynamics of RNA binding proteins during live-cell imaging. In this report, we demonstrate that certain conditions of live-imaging C. elegans can cause an inadvertent stress and trigger phase transitions of RNA binding proteins. We show that imaging stress stimulates decondensation of multiple germ granule proteins, and condensation of several P-body proteins. Proteins within larger RNP granules in meiotically-arrested oocytes do not appear to be as sensitive to imaging stress as proteins in diakinesis oocytes of young hermaphrodites, with the exception of the germ granule protein PGL-1. Our results have important methodological implications for all researchers using live-cell imaging techniques. The data also suggest that the RNA binding proteins within large RNP granules of arrested oocytes may have distinct phases which we characterize in our companion paper.",

    "abstract": "The lymphatic vascular system plays important roles in various physiological and pathological processes, and lack of lymphatic or lymphovenous valves always causes lymph or blood reflux, and can lead to lymphedema. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the valve formation is poorly understood. Here we report that the MAPK/Erk signaling needs to be repressed during the valve-forming lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) fate determination, which differs from its positive role in the LECs specification. Up-regulation of MAPK/Erk signaling in ephb4b, efnb2a;efnb2b and rasa1a;rasa1b mutants leads to lymphatic valve defects, whereas simultaneous loss of Erk1 and Erk2 causes valve hyperplasia. Moreover, valve defects in ephb4b or rasa1a;rasa1b mutants are mitigated in the presence of MEK inhibitors, indicating a new function of Efnb2-Ephb4-Rasa1 cassette in lymphatic valve progenitor cells specification by repressing MAPK/Erk activity. Therefore, our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the lymphatic valve formation and potential drug targets for related lymphatic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Recently identified palmitoylation of PD-L1 is essential for immune regulation. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism, we performed giant plasma membrane vesicle (GPMV) experiments, {micro}s-scale all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and immune killing experiments. GPMV experiments indicated that PD-L1 palmitoylation enhanced its lipid raft affinity. MD simulations revealed dramatically different membrane orientation states of PD-L1 in liquid-ordered (Lo, lipid raft) compared to liquid-disordered (Ld, non-raft) membrane environments. Ld region promoted the \"lie-down\" orientation of PD-L1, which could inhibit its association with the PD-1 protein on immune cells and thus promote the immune killing of cancer cells. This hypothesis was supported by immune killing experiments using{gamma}{delta} T cells as effector cells and NCI-H1299 lung cancer cells as target cells. In short, our study demonstrates that the palmitoylation affects PD-L1s membrane localization and then membrane orientation, which thus regulates its binding with T cell PD-1 and the immune regulation. These observations may guide therapeutic strategies by explicating the regulation of immune checkpoint proteins by post-translational modifications and membrane environments.",

    "abstract": "Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are key regulators of basal ganglia functions. The axonal domain of these neurons is highly complex, with a large subset of non-synaptic release sites and a smaller subset of synaptic terminals from which glutamate or GABA are released. The molecular mechanisms regulating the connectivity of DA neurons and their neurochemical identity are unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that the trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules neurexins (Nrxns) regulate DA neuron neurotransmission. Conditional deletion of all Nrxns in DA neurons (DAT::Nrxns KO) showed that loss of Nrxns does not impair the basic development and ultrastructural characteristics of DA neuron terminals. However, loss of Nrxns caused an impairment of DA transmission revealed as a reduced rate of DA reuptake following activity-dependent DA release, decreased DA transporter levels, increased vesicular monoamine transporter expression, and impaired amphetamine-induced locomotor activity. Strikingly, electrophysiological recording revealed an increase of GABA co-release from DA neuron axons in the striatum of the KO mice. These findings suggest that Nrxns act as key regulators of DA neuron connectivity and DA-mediated functions.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe study provides the first direct evidence of the role of neurexins in dopaminergic neurons.\nC_LIO_LIThe synaptic adhesion molecules, neurexins, are not required for maintaining the structure of dopamine neuron terminals.\nC_LIO_LINeurexins regulate dopaminergic neurotransmission through regulation of dopamine reuptake, impacting amphetamine-induced locomotion.\nC_LIO_LIDeletion of Nrxns in DA neurons causes a region-specific increase of GABA release by DA neurons.\nC_LI",
