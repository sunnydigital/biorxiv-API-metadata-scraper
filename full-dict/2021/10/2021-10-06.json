    "abstract": "Human gut microbiota has co-evolved with human, and plays important roles in regulating the development and functioning of the host immune system. To study the human-specific microbiome-immunune interaction in an animal model is challenging as the animal model needs to capture both the human-specific immune functions and the human-specific microbiome composition. Here we combined two widely-used humanization procedures to generate a humanized mouse model (HMA-huCD34) with functional human leukocytes developed from engrafted huCD34+ cells and human fecal microbes introduced through fecal microbiota transplantation, and investigated how the two introduced human components interact. We found that the engrafted human leukocytes are resilient to the transplanted human microbes, while reciprocally the transplanted microbial community in the huCD34 mice was significantly different from mice without a humanized immune system. By tracking the colonization of human fecal Bacteroides strains in the mouse gut, we found that the composition of the strain population changes over time, the trajectory of which depends upon the type of mouse. On the other hand, different from Bacteroides, Akkermansia muciniphila exhibited consistent and rapid fixation of a single donor strain in all tested mice, suggesting strong purifying selection common to all mouse types. Our prospect study illustrated the complex interactions between the transplanted microbiome and different host factors, and suggested that the humanized mouse model may not faithfully reproduce the human-specific microbiome-immune interaction.",

    "abstract": "Robust severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in nasal turbinate (NT) accounts for high viral transmissibility, yet whether neutralizing IgA antibodies can control it remains unknown. Here, we evaluated receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific monomeric B8-mIgA1 and B8-mIgA2, and dimeric B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 against intranasal SARS-CoV-2 challenge in Syrian hamsters. These antibodies exhibited comparably potent neutralization against authentic virus by competing with human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor for RBD binding. While reducing viruses in lungs, pre-exposure intranasal B8-dIgA1 or B8-dIgA2 led to 81-fold more infectious viruses and severer damage in NT than placebo. Virus-bound B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 could engage CD209 as an alternative receptor for entry into ACE2-negative cells and allowed viral cell-to-cell transmission. Cryo-EM revealed B8 as a class II neutralizing antibody binding trimeric RBDs in 3-up or 2-up/1-down conformation. Therefore, RBD-specific neutralizing dIgA engages an unexpected action for enhanced SARS-CoV-2 nasal infection and injury in Syrian hamsters.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomes are often seen as monolithic machines produced from uniformly regulated genes. However, in yeast most ribosomal proteins are produced from duplicated genes. Here, we demonstrate that gene duplications may serve as a stress response mechanism that modulates the global proteome through differential post-translational modification of ribosomal proteins paralogs. Our data indicate that the yeast paralog pair of the ribosomal protein L7/uL30 produces two differentially acetylated proteins. Under normal conditions most ribosomes incorporate the hypo-acetylated  major form favoring the translation of genes with short open reading frames. Exposure to drugs, on the other hand, increases the production of ribosomes carrying the hyper-acetylated minor paralog that increases translation of long reading frames. Many of these genes encode cell wall proteins that increase drug resistance in a programed change in translation equilibrium. Together the data reveal a mechanism of translation control through the differential fates of near-identical ribosomal protein isoforms.",

    "abstract": "Sox8 is a developmentally important transcription factor that plays an important role in sex maintenance and fertility of adult mice. In the B-type spermatogonial cells, Sox8 is regulated by the lncRNA Mrhl in a p68-dependant manner under the control of the Wnt signalling pathway. The downregulation of Mrhl leads to the meiotic commitment of the spermatogonial cells in a Sox8-dependant manner. While the molecular players involved in the regulation of transcription at the Sox8 promoter have been worked out, our current study points to the involvement of the architectural proteins CTCF and cohesin in mediating a chromatin loop that brings the Sox8 promoter in contact with a silencer element present within the gene body in the presence of lncRNA Mrhl concomitant with transcriptional repression. Further, lncRNA Mrhl interacts with the Sox8 locus through the formation of a DNA:DNA:RNA triplex which is necessary for the recruitment of PRC2 to the locus. The downregulation of lncRNA Mrhl results in the promoter-silencer loop giving way to a promoter-enhancer loop. This active transcription associated chromatin loop is mediated by YY1 and brings the promoter in contact with the enhancer present downstream of the gene.",

To what extent membrane-resident autophagy receptors also respond to organelle-restricted cues to induce selective autophagy remains poorly understood. We find that latent activation of the yeast pexophagy receptor Atg36 by the casein kinase Hrr25 in rich media is repressed by the ATPase activity of Pex1/6, the catalytic subunits of the exportomer AAA+ transmembrane complex enabling protein import into peroxisomes. Quantitative proteomics of purified Pex3, an obligate Atg36 co-receptor, support a model in which exportomer represses Atg36 without assistance from additional membrane factors. Indeed, we reconstitute inhibition of Atg36 phosphorylation in vitro using soluble Pex1/6 and define an N-terminal unstructured region of Atg36 that enables regulation by binding to Pex1. Our findings uncover a mechanism by which a compartment-specific AAA+ complex mediating organelle biogenesis and protein quality control staves off induction of selective autophagy.",

    "abstract": "Multiple genetic association studies have correlated a common allelic block linked to the BAG3 gene with a decreased incidence of heart failure, but the molecular mechanism for such protection remains elusive. One of the variants in this allele block is coding, changing cysteine to arginine at position 151 of BAG3 (rs2234962-BAG3C151R). Here, we use induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to test if the BAG3C151R variant alters protein and cellular function in human cardiac myocytes. Quantitative protein interaction network analysis identified specific changes in BAG3C151R protein interaction partners in cardiomyocytes but not in iPSCs or an immortalized cell line. Knockdown of BAG3 interacting factors in cardiomyocytes followed by myofibrillar analysis revealed that BAG3C151R associates more strongly with proteins involved in the maintenance of myofibrillar integrity. Finally, we demonstrate that cardiomyocytes expressing the BAG3C151R variant have improved response to proteotoxic stress in an allele dose-dependent manner. This study suggests that the BAG3C151R variant increases cardiomyocyte protection from stress by enhancing the recruitment of factors critical to the maintenance of myofibril integrity, hinting that this variant could be responsible for the cardioprotective effect of the haplotype block. By revealing specific changes in preferential binding partners of the BAG3C151R protein variant, we also identify potential targets for the development of novel cardioprotective therapies.",

    "abstract": "Nebulin is a major structural protein of skeletal sarcomeres and is essential for proper assembly and contraction of skeletal muscle1. It stabilises and regulates the length of thin filaments,2 but the structural mechanism remains nebulous. Using electron cryotomography and sub-tomogram averaging, we present the first structure of native nebulin bound to thin filaments within the A-band and I-band of intact sarcomeres. This in-situ reconstruction reveals unprecedented detail of interaction at pseudo-atomic resolution between nebulin and actin, providing the basis for understanding the structural and regulatory roles of nebulin. The position of nebulin on the thin filament indicates that there is no contact to tropomyosin or myosin, but an unexpected interaction with a troponin-T linker, possibly through two binding motifs on nebulin. In addition, our structure of myosin bound to the thin filaments reveals different conformations of the neck domain, both within the same sarcomere and when compared to purified structures, highlighting an inherent structural variability in muscle. We provide a complete description of cross-bridge formation on fully native, nebulin-containing thin filaments at near-atomic scale. Our structures establish the molecular basis for the role of nebulin as a thin filament \"molecular ruler\" and the impact of nemaline myopathies mutations that will aid future development of therapies.",

    "abstract": "We have curated a high-quality, \"best parts\" reference dataset of about 3 million protein residues in about 15,000 PDB-format coordinate files, each containing only residues with good electron density support for a physically acceptable model conformation. The resulting pre-filtered data typically contains the entire core of each chain, in quite long continuous fragments. Each reference file is a single protein chain, and the total set of files were selected for low redundancy, high resolution, good MolProbity score, and other chain-level criteria. Then each residue was critically tested for adequate local map quality to firmly support its conformation, which must also be free of serious clashes or covalent-geometry outliers. The resulting Top2018 pre-filtered datasets have been released on the Zenodo online web service and is freely available for all uses under a Creative Commons license. Currently, one dataset is residue-filtered on mainchain plus C{beta} atoms, and a second dataset is full-residue filtered; each is available at 4 different sequence-identity levels. Here, we illustrate both statistics and examples that show the beneficial consequences of residue-level filtering. That process is necessary because even the best of structures contain a few highly disordered local regions with poor density and low-confidence conformations that should not be included in reference data. Therefore the open distribution of these very large, pre-filtered reference datasets constitutes a notable advance for structural bioinformatics and the fields that depend upon it.\n\nThe Top2018 dataset provides the first representative sample of 3D protein structure for which excellence of experimental data constrains the detailed local conformation to be correct for essentially all 3 million residues included. Earlier generations of residue-filtered datasets were central in developing MolProbity validation used worldwide, and now Zenodo has enabled anyone to use out latest version as a sound basis for structural bioinformatics, protein design, prediction, improving biomedically important structures, or other applications.",

    "abstract": "ATP is universally conserved as the principal energy currency in cells, driving metabolism through phosphorylation and condensation reactions. Such deep conservation suggests that ATP arose at an early stage of biochemical evolution. Yet purine synthesis requires six phosphorylation steps linked to ATP hydrolysis. This autocatalytic requirement for ATP to synthesize ATP implies the need for an earlier prebiotic ATP-equivalent, which could drive protometabolism before purine synthesis. Why this early phosphorylating agent was replaced, and specifically with ATP rather than other nucleotide triphosphates, remains a mystery. Here we show that the deep conservation of ATP reflects its prebiotic chemistry in relation to another universally conserved intermediate, acetyl phosphate, which bridges between thioester and phosphate metabolism by linking acetyl CoA to the substrate-level phosphorylation of ADP. We confirm earlier results showing that acetyl phosphate can phosphorylate ADP to ATP at nearly 20 % yield in water in the presence of Fe3+ ions. We then show that Fe3+ and acetyl phosphate are surprisingly favoured: a panel of other prebiotically relevant ions and minerals did not catalyze ADP phosphorylation; nor did a number of other potentially prebiotic phosphorylating agents. Only carbamoyl phosphate showed some modest phosphorylating activity. Critically, we show that acetyl phosphate does not phosphorylate other nucleotide diphosphates or free pyrophosphate in water. The phosphorylation of ADP monomers seems to be favoured by the interaction between the N6 amino group on the adenine ring with Fe3+ coupled to acetyl phosphate. Our findings suggest that the reason ATP is universally conserved across life is that its formation is chemically favoured in aqueous solution under mild prebiotic conditions.",

    "abstract": "The identification of nonenzymatic pathways for nucleic acid replication is a key challenge in understanding the origin of life. We have previously shown that nonenzymatic RNA primer extension using 2-aminoimidazole (2AI) activated nucleotides occurs primarily through an imidazolium-bridged dinucleotide intermediate. The reactive nature and preorganized structure of the intermediate increase the efficiency of primer extension but remain insufficient to drive extensive copying of RNA templates containing all four canonical nucleotides. To understand the factors that limit RNA copying, we synthesized all ten 2AI-bridged dinucleotide intermediates and measured the kinetics of primer extension in a model. The affinities of the ten dinucleotides for the primer/template/helper complexes vary by over 7,000-fold, consistent with nearest neighbor energetic predictions. Surprisingly, the reaction rates at saturating intermediate concentrations still vary by over 15-fold, with the most weakly binding dinucleotides exhibiting a lower maximal reaction rate. Certain noncanonical nucleotides can decrease sequence dependent differences in affinity and primer extension rate, while monomers bridged to short oligonucleotides exhibit enhanced binding and reaction rates. We suggest that more uniform binding and reactivity of imidazolium-bridged intermediates may lead to the ability to copy arbitrary template sequences under prebiotically plausible conditions.",

    "abstract": "Microbial specialized metabolites are an important source of and inspiration for many pharmaceutical, biotechnological products and play key roles in ecological processes. However, most bioactivity-guided isolation and identification methods widely employed in metabolite discovery programs do not explore the full biosynthetic potential of an organism. Untargeted metabolomics using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry is an efficient technique to access metabolites from fractions and even environmental crude extracts. Nevertheless, metabolomics is limited in predicting structures or bioactivities for cryptic metabolites. Linking the biosynthetic potential inferred from (meta)genomics to the specialized metabolome would accelerate drug discovery programs. Here, we present a k-nearest neighbor classifier to systematically connect mass spectrometry fragmentation spectra to their corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters (independent of their chemical compound class). Our pipeline offers an efficient method to link biosynthetic genes to known, analogous, or cryptic metabolites that they encode for, as detected via mass spectrometry from bacterial cultures or environmental microbiomes. Using paired data sets that include validated genes-mass spectral links from the Paired Omics Data Platform, we demonstrate this approach by automatically linking 18 previously known mass spectra to their corresponding previously experimentally validated biosynthetic genes (i.e., via NMR or genetic engineering). Finally, we demonstrated that this new approach is a substantial step towards making in silico (and even de novo) structure predictions for peptidic metabolites and a glycosylated terpene. Altogether, we conclude that NPOmix minimizes the need for culturing and facilitates specialized metabolite isolation and structure elucidation based on integrative omics mining.\n\nSignificanceThe pace of natural product discovery has remained relatively constant over the last two decades. At the same time, there is an urgent need to find new therapeutics to fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria, cancer, tropical parasites, pathogenic viruses, and other severe diseases. Here, we introduce a new machine learning algorithm that can efficiently connect metabolites to their biosynthetic genes. Our Natural Products Mixed Omics (NPOmix) tool provides access to genomic information for bioactivity, class, (partial) structure, and stereochemistry predictions to prioritize relevant metabolite products and facilitate their structural elucidation. Our approach can be applied to biosynthetic genes from bacteria (used in this study), fungi, algae, and plants where (meta)genomes are paired with corresponding mass fragmentation data.",

    "abstract": "In the human gut microbiome, specific strains emerge due to within-host evolution and can occasionally be transferred to or from other hosts. Phenotypic variance among such strains can have implications for strain transmission and interaction with the host. Surveilling strains of the same species, within and between individuals, can further our knowledge about the way in which microbial diversity is generated and maintained in host populations. Existing methods to estimate the biological relatedness of similar strains usually rely on either detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), which may include sequencing errors, or on the analysis of pangenomes, which can be limited by the requirement for extensive gene databases. To complement existing methods, we developed SynTracker. This strain-comparison tool is based on synteny comparisons between strains, or the comparison of the arrangement of sequence blocks in two homologous genomic regions in pairs of metagenomic assemblies or genomes. Our method is executed in a species-specific manner, has a low sensitivity to SNPs, does not require a pre-existing database, and can correctly resolve strains using complete or draft genomes and metagenomic samples using <5% of the genome length. When applied to metagenomic datasets, we detected person-specific strains with an average sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 99%, and strain-sharing events in mother-infant pairs. SynTracker can be used to study the population structure of specific microbial species between and within environments, to identify evolutionary trajectories in longitudinal datasets, and to further understanding of strain sharing networks.",

    "abstract": "For many intracellular pathogens, the phagosome is the site of events and interactions that shape infection outcome. Phagosomal membrane damage, in particular, is proposed to benefit invading pathogens. To define the innate immune consequences of this damage, we profiled macrophage transcriptional responses to wild-type Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and mutants that fail to damage the phagosomal membrane. We identified a set of genes with enhanced expression in response to the mutants. These genes represented a late component of the TLR2-dependent transcriptional response to Mtb, distinct from an earlier component that included TNF. Expression of the later component was inherent to TLR2 activation, dependent upon endosomal uptake, and enhanced by phagosome acidification. Canonical Mtb virulence factors that contribute to phagosomal membrane damage blunted phagosome acidification and undermined the endosome-specific response. Profiling cell survival and bacterial growth in macrophages demonstrated that the attenuation of these mutants is partially dependent upon TLR2. Further, TLR2 contributed to the attenuated phenotype of one of these mutants in a murine model of infection. These results demonstrate two distinct components of the TLR2 response and identify a component dependent upon endosomal uptake as a point where pathogenic bacteria interfere with the generation of effective inflammation. This interference promotes TB pathogenesis in both macrophage and murine infection models.",

    "abstract": "Cholesterol is the most abundant lipid in the erythrocyte. During its blood stage development, the malaria parasite establishes an active cholesterol gradient across the various membrane systems within the infected erythrocyte. Interestingly, some antimalarial compounds have recently been shown to disrupt cholesterol homeostasis in intraerythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum. These studies point to the importance of cholesterol for parasite growth. Previously, reduction of cholesterol from the erythrocyte membrane by treatment with methyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin (M{beta}CD) was shown to inhibit parasite invasion and growth. In addition, M{beta}CD treatment of trophozoite stage P. falciparum was shown to result in parasite expulsion from the host cell. We have revisited these phenomena by using live video microscopy, ultrastructural analysis, and response to antimalarial compounds. By using time-lapse video microscopy of fluorescently tagged parasites, we show that M{beta}CD treatment for just 30 min causes dramatic expulsion of the trophozoite stage parasites. This forceful expulsion occurs within 10 sec. Remarkably, the plasma membrane of the host cell from which the parasite has been expelled does not appear to be compromised. The parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) continued to surround the extruded parasite, but the PVM appeared damaged. Treatment with antimalarial compounds targeting PfATP4 or PfNCR1 prevented M{beta}CD-mediated extrusion of the parasites, pointing to a potential role of cholesterol dynamics underlying the expulsion phenomena. We also confirmed the essential role of erythrocyte plasma membrane cholesterol for invasion and growth of P. falciparum. This defect can be partially complemented by cholesterol and desmosterol but not with epicholesterol, revealing stereospecificity underlying cholesterol function. Overall, our studies advance previous observations and reveal unusual cell biological features underlying cholesterol depletion of infected erythrocyte plasma membrane.\n\nImportanceMalaria remains a major challenge in much of the world. Symptoms of malaria are caused by the growth of parasites belonging to Plasmodium spp. inside the red blood cells (RBC), leading to their destruction. The parasite depends upon its host for much of its nutritional need. Cholesterol is a major lipid in the RBC plasma membrane, which is the only source of this lipid for malarial parasites. We have previously shown that certain new antimalarial compounds disrupt cholesterol homeostasis in P. falciparum. Here we use live time-lapse video microscopy to show dramatic expulsion of the parasite from the host RBC when the cholesterol content of the RBC is reduced. Remarkably, this expulsion is inhibited by the antimalarials that disrupt lipid homeostasis. We also show stereospecificity of cholesterol in supporting parasite growth inside RBC. Overall, these results point to a critical role of cholesterol in physiology of malaria parasites.",

Here, we show that COPD patients have increased IL-36{gamma} and decreased IL-36 receptor antagonist (IL-36Ra) in bronchoalveolar and nasal fluid compared to control subjects. IL-36{gamma} is derived mainly from small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) and further induced by a viral mimetic, whereas IL-36RA is derived from macrophages. IL-36{gamma} stimulates release of the neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL1 and CXCL8, as well as elastolytic matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) from small airway fibroblasts (SAF). Proteases released from COPD neutrophils cleave and activate IL-36{gamma} thereby perpetuating IL-36 inflammation. Transfer of culture media from SAEC to SAF stimulated release of CXCL1, that was inhibited by exogenous IL-36RA. The use of a therapeutic antibody that inhibits binding to the IL-36 receptor (IL-36R) attenuated IL-36{gamma} driven inflammation and cellular cross talk. We have demonstrated a novel mechanism for the amplification and propagation of neutrophilic inflammation in COPD and that blocking this cytokine family via a IL-36R neutralising antibody could be a promising new therapeutic strategy in the treatment of COPD.",

In addition to being a valuable novel and accessible research resource, the production of >3,300 knockout mouse lines using comparable protocols provides a rich dataset to analyze experimental and biological variables affecting in vivo null allele engineering with Cas9. Mouse line production has two critical steps - generation of founders with the desired allele and germline transmission (GLT) of that allele from founders to offspring. Our analysis identified that whether a gene is essential for viability was the primary factor influencing successful production of null alleles.

    "abstract": "Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) demonstrates great potential for visualization of tissue microvasculature at depth with high spatial resolution. The success of ULM heavily depends on the robust localization of isolated microbubbles (MBs), which can be challenging in vivo especially within larger vessels where MBs can overlap and cluster close together. While MB dilution alleviates the issue of MB overlap to a certain extent, it drastically increases the data acquisition time needed for MBs to populate the microvasculature, which is already on the order of several minutes using recommended MB concentrations. Inspired by optical super-resolution imaging based on stimulated emission depletion (STED), here we propose a novel ULM imaging sequence based on microbubble uncoupling via transmit excitation (MUTE). MUTE \"silences\" MB signals by creating acoustic nulls to facilitate MB separation, which leads to robust localization of MBs especially under high concentrations. The efficiency of localization accomplished via the proposed technique was first evaluated in simulation studies with conventional ULM as a benchmark. Then an in vivo study based on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chicken embryos showed that MUTE could reduce the data acquisition time by half thanks to the enhanced MB separation and localization. Finally, the performance of MUTE was validated in an in vivo mouse brain study. These results demonstrate the high MB localization efficacy of MUTE-ULM, which contributes to a reduced data acquisition time and improved temporal resolution for ULM.",

    "abstract": "Modular methods for directing mammalian gene expression would enable advances in tissue regeneration, enhance cell-based therapeutics and improve modulation of immune responses. To address this challenge, engineered endosymbionts (EES) that escape endosomal destruction, reside in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells, and secrete proteins that are transported to the nucleus to control host cell gene expression were developed. Microscopy confirmed that EES escape phagosomes, replicate within the cytoplasm, and can secrete reporter proteins into the cytoplasm that were then transported to the nucleus. Synthetic operons encoding the mammalian transcription factors, Stat-1 and Klf6 or Klf4 and Gata-3 were recombined into the EES genome. Using controlled induction, these EES were shown to direct gene expression in J774A.1 macrophage/monocyte cells and modulate the host cell fates. Expressing mammalian transcription factors from engineered intracellular bacteria as endosymbionts comprises a new tool for directing host cell gene expression for therapeutic and research purposes.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=194 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/463266v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2b5935org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1edd8edorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3cb5b9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1be9b5f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Malaria is one of the deadliest vector-borne diseases in the world. Researchers are developing new genetic and conventional vector control strategies to attempt to limit its burden. Novel control strategies require detailed safety assessment to ensure responsible and successful deployments. Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) and Anopheles coluzzii, two closely related subspecies within the species complex Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.), are among the dominant malaria vectors in sub-Saharan Africa. These two subspecies readily hybridise and compete in the wild and are also known to have distinct niches, each with spatially and temporally varying carrying capacities driven by precipitation and land use factors.\n\nWe model the spread and persistence of a population-modifying gene drive system in these subspecies across sub-Saharan Africa by simulating introductions of genetically modified mosquitoes across the African mainland and its offshore islands. We explore transmission of the gene drive between the two subspecies that arise from different hybridisation mechanisms, the effects of both local dispersal and potential wind-aided migration to the spread, and the development of resistance to the gene drive. Given the best current available knowledge on the subspecies life histories, we find that an introduced gene drive system with typical characteristics can plausibly spread from even distant offshore islands to the African mainland with the aid of wind-driven migration, with resistance taking over within a decade. Our model accounts for regional to continental scale mechanisms, and demonstrates a range of realistic dynamics including the effect of prevailing wind on spread and spatio-temporally varying carrying capacities for subspecies. As a result, it is well-placed to answer future questions relating to mosquito gene drives as important life history parameters become better understood.",

Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), the mildest form of CAPS, is characterized by cold-induced inflammation induced by the overproduction of IL-1{beta}. However, the molecular mechanism of how mutated NLRP3 causes inflammasome activation in CAPS remains unclear. Here, we found that CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants form cryo-sensitive aggregates that function as a scaffold for inflammasome activation. Cold exposure promoted inflammasome assembly and subsequent IL-1{beta} release triggered by mutated NLRP3. While K+ efflux was dispensable, Ca2+ was indispensable for mutated NLRP3-mediated inflammasome assembly. Notably, Ca2+ influx was induced during mutated NLRP3-mediated inflammasome assembly. Furthermore, caspase-1 inhibition prevented Ca2+ influx and inflammasome assembly induced by the mutated NLRP3, suggesting a feed-forward Ca2+ influx loop triggered by mutated NLRP3. Thus, the mutated NLRP3 forms cryo-sensitive aggregates to promote inflammasome assembly distinct from canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",

    "abstract": "Enteroviruses are non-enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses that cause diverse diseases in humans. Their rapid multiplication depends on remodeling of cytoplasmic membranes for viral genome replication. It is unknown how virions assemble around these newly synthesized genomes and how they are then loaded into autophagic membranes for release through secretory autophagy. Here, we use cryo-electron tomography of infected cells to show that poliovirus assembles directly on replication membranes. Pharmacological untethering of capsids from membranes abrogates RNA encapsidation. Our data directly visualize a membrane-bound half-capsid as a prominent virion assembly intermediate. Assembly progression past this intermediate depends on the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase VPS34, a key host-cell autophagy factor. On the other hand, the canonical autophagy initiator ULK1 is shown to restrict virion production since its inhibition leads to increased accumulation of virions in vast intracellular arrays, followed by an increased vesicular release at later time points. Finally, we identify multiple layers of selectivity in virus-induced autophagy, with a strong selection for RNA-loaded virions over empty capsids and the segregation of virions from other types of autophagosome contents. These findings provide an integrated structural framework for multiple stages of the poliovirus life cycle.",

    "abstract": "Replication origins are licensed by loading two Mcm2-7 helicases around DNA in a head-to-head conformation poised to initiate bidirectional replication. This process requires ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1. Although different Cdc6 and Cdt1 molecules load each helicase, whether two ORC proteins are required is unclear. Using colocalization single-molecule spectroscopy combined with FRET, we investigated interactions between ORC and Mcm2-7 during helicase loading. We demonstrate that a single ORC molecule can recruit both Mcm2-7/Cdt1 complexes via similar interactions that end upon Cdt1 release. Between the first and second helicase recruitment, we observe a rapid change in interactions between ORC and the first Mcm2-7. In quick succession ORC breaks the interactions mediating first Mcm2-7 recruitment, releases from its initial DNA-binding site, and forms a new interaction with the opposite face of the first Mcm2-7. This rearrangement requires release of the first Cdt1 and tethers ORC as it flips over the first Mcm2-7 to form an inverted Mcm2-7-ORC-DNA complex required for second-helicase recruitment. To ensure correct licensing, this complex is maintained until head-to-head interactions between the two helicases are formed. Our findings reconcile previous observations and reveal a highly-coordinated series of events through which a single ORC molecule can load two oppositely-oriented helicases.",

The living skin equivalent (LSE) is an organotypic coculture containing keratinocytes cultivated on fibroblast-populated dermal substitutes.

The RNA-seq analysis data and Ingenuity pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes of trehalose-treated 2D and 3D fibroblasts at early time points revealed the involvement of the CDKN1A pathway, which is necessary for the marked upregulation of growth factors including DPT. By contrast, the mRNA-seq data of LSEs 2-weeks after air exposure indicated that gene expression profiles are similar for untreated and trehalose-treated cells in both keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The trehalose-treated fibroblasts were positive for senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase with the significantly downregulated expressions of LMNB1. Finally, we demonstrated that transplantation of the dermal substitute with trehalose-treated fibroblasts accelerated wound closure and increased capillary formation significantly in the experimental mouse wounds in vivo. These data indicate that high-concentration trehalose can induce the beneficial senescence-associated secretory phenotype in fibroblasts via CDKN1A/p21, which may be therapeutically useful for optimal wound repair.",

    "abstract": "RNAs in circulation carry sequence-specific regulatory information between cells in plant, animal, and host-pathogen systems. Such RNA can cross generational boundaries, as evidenced by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from somatic cells of the nematode C. elegans silencing genes of matching sequence in the germline and in progeny. Here we dissect the intergenerational path taken by dsRNA from parental circulation and discover that cytosolic entry in the parental germline and/or developing progeny through the dsRNA importer SID-1 varies based on developmental time and dsRNA substrates. Temporary loss of SID-1 causes changes in the expression of the sid-1-dependent gene sdg-1 that can last for more than 100 generations. The SDG-1 protein is enriched in perinuclear Z granules required for heritable RNA silencing, but it is expressed from a retrotransposon targeted by such RNA silencing. This auto-inhibitory loop reveals how retrotransposons could persist over evolutionary time by hosting genes that regulate their own silencing.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral organoids model the development of the human brain and are an indispensable tool for studying neurodevelopment. Whole-organoid lineage tracing has revealed the number of progeny arising from each initial stem cell to be highly diverse, with lineage sizes ranging from one to more than 20,000 cells. This exceeds what can be explained by existing stochastic models of corticogenesis, indicating the existence of an additional source of stochasticity. We propose the SAN model in which this additional source of stochasticity is the survival time of a lineage which a long-lived population of symmetrically dividing cells under neutral competition. We demonstrate this model to explain the experimentally observed variability of lineage sizes and derive a formula that captures the quantitative relationship between survival time and lineage size. Finally, we show that our model implies the existence of a regulatory mechanism to keeps the size of the symmetrically dividing cell population constant.",

    "abstract": "Amaranths serve as pseudo cereals and also as traditional leafy vegetables worldwide. In addition to high vigor and richness in nutrients, drought and salinity tolerance of amaranth makes it a promising vegetable to acclimatize to the effects of global climate change. The World Vegetable Center genebank conserves about 1,000 amaranth accessions and various agronomic properties of these accessions were recorded during seed regeneration over decades. In this study, we verified the taxonomic annotation of the germplasm based on a 15K SNP set. Besides, in the assumption that the yield components of grain amaranths are different from those of leaf amaranths, we observed that grain amaranths presented larger inflorescences and earlier flowering than leaf amaranths. Dual-purpose amaranth showed larger leaves than leaf amaranths and later flowering than grain amaranths, which seemed reasonable because farmers can harvest more leaves during the prolonged vegetable stage, which also provides recovery time to enrich grain production. Considering frequent interspecies hybridization among grain amaranth complex, we proposed an interspecies GWAS for days to flowering, identifying a AGL20/SOC1 homolog. Meanwhile, another GWAS using only A. tricolor accessions revealed six candidate genes homologous to lba1, bri1, sgs1 and fca. These homologous genes were involved in the regulation of flowering time in Arabidopsis. This study revealed the usefulness of genotypes for species demarcation in the genus Amaranthus and the potential of interspecies GWAS to detect QTLs across different species, opening up the possibility of targeted introduction of specific genetic variants into different Amaranthus species.",

    "abstract": "Emotional contagion is the most ancestral form of empathy that relies on simple perception-action mechanisms, on top of which more complex forms of empathic behaviors, such as consolation and helping, have evolved. Here we tested to what extent the proximate mechanisms of emotional contagion are evolutionary conserved by assessing the role of oxytocin, known to regulate empathic behaviors in mammals, in social fear contagion in zebrafish, which represents an evolutionary divergent line to that of tetrapods, within vertebrates. Using mutants for the ligand of the fish oxytocin nonapeptide and both of its receptors in zebrafish we showed that oxytocin is necessary for observer zebrafish to copy the distressed behavior of conspecific demonstrators. Exogeneous administration of oxytocin to the ligand mutant rescued the ability of observers to express social fear transmission, indicating that oxytocin is not only necessary but also sufficient for emotional contagion. The brain regions in the ventral telencephalon that are associated with emotional contagion in zebrafish are homologous to those known to be involved in the same process in rodents (e.g. striatum, lateral septum), and receive direct projections from oxytocinergic neurons located in the pre-optic area. Finally, we ruled out the hypothesis that social transmission of fear in zebrafish merely relies on behavior contagion by motor imitation, and we showed that it rather relies on emotion discrimination. Together our results support an evolutionary conserved role for oxytocin as a key regulator of basic empathic behaviors across vertebrates.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryOxytocin is necessary and sufficient for social fear contagion in zebrafish supporting an evolutionary conserved role for oxytocin in emotional contagion among vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "Many intracellular signaling events remain poorly characterized due to a general lack of tools to interfere with \"undruggable\" targets. Antibodies have the potential to elucidate intracellular mechanisms via targeted disruption of cell signaling cascades because of their ability to bind to a target with high specificity and affinity. However, due to their size and chemical composition, antibodies cannot innately cross the cell membrane, and thus access to the cytosol with these macromolecules has been limited. Here, we describe strategies for accessing the intracellular space with recombinant antibodies mediated by cationic lipid nanoparticles to selectively disrupt intracellular signaling events. To enable such investigations, we first produced a series of antibody constructs, known as scFv-Fcs, containing additional, genetically encoded negative charges located at the C-termini of the constructs. Preparing proteins with negatively charged motifs has previously been shown to enhance intracellular protein delivery with cationic lipids, but usually for the purpose of genome editing or targeted cell death. We started by generating derivatives of scFv-Fc17, an antibody construct previously reported to bind specifically to signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylated at Tyr705 (pYSTAT3). We screened a small number of lipids from our combinatorial lipid library with flow cytometry and found that PBA-Q76-O16B facilitated the most efficient delivery of scFv-Fcs under the conditions tested. In HepG2 cells, we observed up to 60.5% delivery efficacy, while in a STAT3-luciferase reporter cell line up to 71.5% delivery efficacy was observed. These results demonstrated the feasibility of accessing the intracellular space with scFv-Fcs. However, we also note that no more than modest changes were observed upon changing the numbers of negative charges in these constructs during delivery. Characterization of the cytotoxicity, size, and encapsulation efficiency of scFv-Fcs with PBA-Q76-O16B revealed that the constructs were generally well-behaved, with addition of differing quantities of negative charge resulting in at most modest effects. Importantly, functional assays monitoring transcriptional activity in luciferase reporter cell lines and HepG2 cells demonstrated significant reduction of gene expression downstream of pYSTAT3 following delivery of scFv-Fc17 constructs. Together, our results establish the use of recombinantly produced antibodies to selectively interfere with cell signaling events driven by a single posttranslational modification. Efficient intracellular delivery of engineered antibodies opens up possibilities for modulation of previously \"undruggable\" targets, including for potential therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "Localization of messenger RNAs (mRNA) as a widely observed phenomenon is considered as an efficient way to target proteins to a specific region of a cell and is also known as a strategy for gene regulation. The importance of correct intracellular RNA placement in the development of embryonic and neural dendrites has long been demonstrated in former studies. Improper localization of RNA in the cell, which has been shown to occur due to a variety of reasons, including mutations in trans-regulatory elements, is also associated with the occurrence of some neuromuscular diseases as well as cancer. We propose NN-RNALoc, a neural network-based model to predict the cellular location of mRNAs. The features extracted from mRNA sequences along with the information gathered from their proteins are fed to this prediction model. We introduce a novel distance-based sub-sequence profile for representation of RNA sequences which is more memory and time efficient and comparying to the k-mer frequencies, can possibly better encode sequences when the distance k increases. The performance of NN-RNALoc on the following benchmark datsets CeFra-seq and RNALocate, is compared to the results achieved by two powerful prediction models that were proposed in former studies named as mRNALoc and RNATracker The results reveal that the employment of protein-protein interaction information, which plays a crucial role in many biological functions, together with the novel distance-based sub-sequence profiles of mRNA sequences, leads to a more accurate prediction model. Besides, NN-RNALoc significantly reduces the required computing time compared to previous studies.

    "abstract": "Aminoglycoside antibiotics interfere with selection of cognate tRNAs during translation, resulting in the production of aberrant proteins that are the ultimate cause of the antibiotic bactericidal effect. To determine if these aberrant proteins are recognized as substrates by the cells protein quality control machinery, we studied whether the heat shock (HS) response was activated following exposure of Escherichia coli to the aminoglycoside kanamycin (Kan). Levels of the HS transcription factor {sigma}32 increased about 10-fold after exposure to Kan, indicating that at least some aberrant proteins were recognized as substrates by the molecular chaperone DnaK. To investigate whether toxic aberrant proteins therefore might escape detection by the QC machinery, we studied model aberrant proteins that had a bactericidal effect when expressed in E. coli from cloned genes. As occurred following exposure to Kan, levels of {sigma}32 were permanently elevated following expression of an acutely toxic 48-residue protein (ARF48), indicating that toxic activity and recognition by the QC machinery are not mutually exclusive properties of aberrant proteins, and that the HS response was blocked in these cells at some step downstream of {sigma}32 stabilization. This block could result from halting of protein synthesis or from radial condensation of nucleoids, both of which occurred rapidly following ARF48 induction. Nucleoids were similarly condensed following expression of toxic aberrant secretory proteins, suggesting that transertion of inner membrane proteins, a process that expands nucleoids into an open conformation that promotes growth and gene expression, was disrupted in these cells. The 48-residue ARF48 protein would be well-suited for structural studies to further investigate the toxic mechanism of aberrant proteins.",
