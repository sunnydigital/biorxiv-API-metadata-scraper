    "abstract": "Bone and bone marrow are vital to mammalian structure, movement, and immunity. These tissues are also commonly subjected to molecular alterations giving rise to debilitating diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, osteomyelitis, and cancer. Technologies such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) enable the discovery of spatially resolved chemical information in biological tissue samples to help elucidate the complex molecular processes underlying pathology. Traditionally, preparation of native osseous tissue for MALDI IMS has been difficult due to the mineralized composition and heterogenous morphology of the tissue, and compensation for these challenges with decalcification and fixation protocols can remove or delocalize molecular species. Here, sample preparation methods were advanced to enable multimodal MALDI IMS of undecalcified, fresh-frozen murine femurs allowing the distribution of endogenous lipids to be linked to specific tissue structures and cell types. Adhesive-bound bone sections were mounted onto conductive glass slides with a microscopy-compatible glue and freeze-dried to minimize artificial bone marrow damage. Subliming matrix does not induce further bone marrow cracking, and recrystallizing the deposited matrix improves lipid signal. High spatial resolution (10 m) MALDI IMS was employed to characterize lipid distributions in fresh-frozen bone, and use of complementary microscopy modalities aided tissue and cell assignments. For example, various phosphatidylcholines localize to bone marrow, adipose tissue, marrow adipose tissue, and muscle. Further, sphingomyelin(42:1) was abundant in megakaryocytes, whereas sphingomyelin(42:2) was diminished in this cell type. These data reflect the vast molecular and cellular heterogeneity indicative of the bone marrow and the soft tissue surrounding the femur. Multimodal MALDI IMS has the potential to advance bone-related biomedical research by offering deep molecular coverage with spatial relevance in a preserved native bone microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), although rare, is a life-threatening complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Little is known about the pathophysiology of DAH in humans, although increasingly neutrophils, NETosis and inflammatory monocytes have been shown to play an important role in the pristane-induced model of SLE which develops lung hemorrhage and recapitulates many of the pathologic features of human DAH. Using this experimental model, we asked whether endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress played a role in driving the pathology of pulmonary hemorrhage and what role infiltrating neutrophils had in this process. Analysis of lung tissue from pristane-treated mice showed genes associated with ER stress and NETosis were increased in a time-dependent manner and reflected the timing of CD11b+Ly6G+ neutrophil accumulation in the lung. Using precision cut lung slices from untreated mice we observed that neutrophils isolated from the peritoneal cavity of pristane-treated mice could directly induce the expression of genes associated with ER stress, namely Chop and Bip. Mice which had myeloid-specific deletion of PAD4 were generated and treated with pristane to assess the involvement of PAD4 and PAD4-dependent NET formation in pristane-induced lung inflammation. Specific deletion of PAD4 in myeloid cells resulted in decreased expression of ER stress genes in the pristane model, with accompanying reduction in IFN-driven genes and pathology. Lastly, coculture experiments of human neutrophils and human lung epithelial cell line (BEAS-2b) showed neutrophils from SLE patients induced significantly more ER stress and interferon-stimulated genes in epithelial cells compared to healthy control neutrophils. These results support a pathogenic role of neutrophils and NETs in lung injury during pristane-induced DAH through the induction of ER stress response and suggest that overactivation of neutrophils in SLE and NETosis may underlie development of DAH.",

    "abstract": "Engineered long lived plasma cells have the potential to be a new area of cell therapy. A key step in developing this cell therapy is testing in a model with an intact immune system similar to humans. To that end, we have developed methods to purify, expand, and differentiate non-human primate (NHP; rhesus macaque) B cells ex vivo. By comparing several media types and conditions, we consistently achieved 10-fold expansion of NHP B cells using a readily available commercial supplement. After only seven days in culture, large percentages of cells in NHP B cell cultures were differentiated. These cells expressed surface markers found in human antibody secreting cells (CD38 and CD138) and secreted immunoglobulin G. We also identified the serotypes (2.5 and D-J) and conditions necessary for efficient transduction of NHP B cells with AAV vectors for the purposes of producing a secreted protein (BAFF). We hope that this work will accelerate proof-of-concept in vivo studies using engineered protein-secreting B cells in an NHP model.",

    "abstract": "Apoptotic cell death is a cell-intrinsic, immune tolerance mechanism that regulates the magnitude and resolution of T cell-mediated responses. Evasion of apoptosis is critical for the generation of memory T cells, as well as autoimmune T cells, and knowledge of the mechanisms that enable resistance to apoptosis will provide insight into ways to modulate their activity during protective and pathogenic responses. IL-17-producing CD4 T cells (TH17s) are long-lived, memory cells. These features enable their role in host defense, chronic inflammatory disorders, and anti-tumor immunity. A growing number of reports now indicate that TH17s in vivo require mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), a metabolic phenotype that is poorly induced in vitro. To elucidate the role of OXPHOS in TH17 processes, we developed a system to polarize TH17s that metabolically resembled their in vivo counterparts. We discovered that directing TH17s to use OXPHOS promotes mitochondrial fitness, glutamine anaplerosis, and an anti-apoptotic phenotype marked by high BCL-XL and low BIM. Through competitive co-transfer experiments and tumor studies, we further revealed how OXPHOS protects TH17s from cell death while enhancing their persistence in the periphery and tumor microenvironment. Together, our work demonstrates a non-classical role of metabolism in regulating TH17 cell fate and highlights the potential for therapies that target OXPHOS in TH17-driven diseases.",

Here, we report the identification and characterization of MirA, the M. marinum actin-based motility factor. MirA is a member of the glycine-rich PE_PGRS family of ESX-5-secreted proteins. MirA uses an amphipathic helix to anchor into the mycobacterial outer membrane and, surprisingly, also the surface of host lipid droplet organelles. The glycine-rich PGRS domain in MirA directly binds and activates host N-WASP to stimulate actin polymerization through the Arp2/3 complex, directing both bacterial and lipid droplet actin- based motility. MirA is dissimilar to known N-WASP activating ligands and may represent a new class of microbial and host actin regulator. Additionally, the MirA-N-WASP interaction represents a model to understand how the enigmatic PE_PGRS proteins contribute to mycobacterial pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Archaea swim by means of a unique molecular machine called the archaellum. The archaellum consists of an ATP-powered intracellular motor that drives the rotation of an extracellular filament, allowing the cell to rapidly propel itself through liquid media.\n\nThe archaellum filament comprises multiple copies of helically organised subunits named archaellins. While in many species several archaellin homologs are encoded in the same operon, structural studies conducted to date have suggested that archaella consist of only one protein species. Thus, the role of the remaining archaellin genes remains elusive.\n\nHere we present the structure of the Methanocaldococcus villosus archaellum filament at 3.08 [A] resolution. We find that the filament is composed of two alternating archaellins - ArlB1 and ArlB2, suggesting that the architecture and assembly of archaella is more complex than previously thought. Moreover, we identify two major structural elements that enable the archaellum filament to move.\n\nOur findings provide new insights into archaeal motility and challenge the current view on the archaellum architecture and assembly.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, tyrosol functionalized chitosan gold nanoparticles (Chi-TY-AuNPs) were prepared as an alternative treatment strategy to combat fungal infections. Various biophysical techniques were used to characterize the synthesized Chi-TY-AuNPs. The antifungal and antibiofilm activities of Chi-TY-AuNPs were evaluated against C. albicans and C. glabrata and efforts have been made to elucidate the possible mechanism of action. Chi-TY-AuNPs showed a high fungicidal effect against both sessile and planktonic cells of Candida spp. Additionally, Chi-TY-AuNPs completely eradicated (100%) the mature biofilms of both the Candida spp. FESEM analysis highlighted the morphological alterations in Chi-TY-AuNPs treated Candida biofilm cells. Effect of Chi-TY-AuNPs on the ECM components showed significant reduction in protein content in C. glabrata biofilm and substantial decrease in extracellular DNA (eDNA) content of both the Candida spp. ROS generation analysis using DCFDA-PI staining showed high ROS levels in both the Candida spp., whereas pronounced ROS production was observed in Chi-TY-AuNPs treated C. glabrata biofilm. Biochemical analysis revealed decreased ergosterol content in Chi-TY-AuNPs treated C. glabrata cells, while inconsequential changes were observed in C. albicans. Furthermore, the transcriptional expression of selected genes (ergosterol biosynthesis, efflux, sterol importer, and glucan biogenesis) was reduced in C. glabrata in response to Chi-TY-AuNPs except ERG11 and CDR1. Conclusively the result showed the biofilm inhibition and biofilm eradication efficacy of Chi-TY-AuNPs in both the Candida spp. Findings of the present study manifest Chi-TY-AuNPs as a potential therapeutic solution to Candida biofilm-related chronic infections and overcome biofilm antifungal resistance.",

    "abstract": "Nucleotide-based signaling molecules (NSMs) are widespread in bacteria and eukaryotes, where they control important physiological and behavioral processes. In bacteria, NSM-based regulatory networks are highly complex, entailing large numbers of enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of active signaling molecules. How the converging input from multiple enzymes is transformed into robust and unambiguous cellular responses has remained unclear. Here we show that Escherichia coli converts dynamic changes of c-di-GMP into discrete binary signaling states, thereby generating heterogeneous populations with either high or low c-di-GMP. This is mediated by an ultrasensitive switch protein, PdeL, which senses the prevailing cellular concentration of the signaling molecule and couples this information to c-di-GMP degradation and transcription feedback boosting its own expression. We demonstrate that PdeL acts as a digital filter that facilitates precise developmental transitions, confers cellular memory, and generates functional heterogeneity in bacterial populations to evade phage predation. Based on our findings, we propose that bacteria apply ultrasensitive regulatory switches to convert dynamic changes of NSMs into binary signaling modes to allow robust decision-making and bet-hedging for improved overall population fitness.",

    "abstract": "tRNA-derived fragments have been reported in many different organisms and have diverse cellular roles such as regulating gene expression, inhibiting protein translation, silencing transposable elements and modulating cell proliferation. In particular tRNA halves, a class of tRNA fragments produced by the cleavage of tRNAs in the anti-codon loop, have been widely reported to accumulate under stress and regulate translation in cells. Here we report the presence of tRNA-derived fragments in Entamoeba with tRNA halves being the most abundant. We further established that tRNA halves accumulate in the parasites upon different stress stimuli such as oxidative stress, heat shock, and serum starvation. We also observed differential expression of tRNA halves during developmental changes of trophozoite to cyst conversion with various tRNA halves accumulating during early encystation. In contrast to other systems, the stress response does not appear to be mediated by a few specific tRNA halves as multiple tRNAs appear to be processed during the various stresses. Furthermore, we identified some tRNA-derived fragments are associated with Entamoeba Argonaute proteins, EhAgo2-2, and EhAgo2-3, which have a preference for different tRNA-derived fragment species. Finally, we show that tRNA halves are packaged inside extracellular vesicles secreted by amoeba. The ubiquitous presence of tRNA-derived fragments, their association with the Argonaute proteins, and the accumulation of tRNA halves during multiple different stresses including encystation suggest a nuanced level of gene expression regulation mediated by different tRNA-derived fragments in Entamoeba.\n\nImportancetRNA-derived fragments are small RNAs formed by the cleavage of tRNAs at specific positions. These have been reported in many organisms to modulate gene expression and thus regulate various cell functions. In the present study, we report for the first time the presence of tRNA-derived fragments in Entamoeba. tRNA-derived fragments were identified by bioinformatics analyses of small RNA sequencing datasets from the parasites and also confirmed experimentally. We found that tRNA halves accumulated in parasites exposed to environmental stress or during developmental process of encystation. We also found that shorter tRNA-derived fragments are bound to Entamoeba Argonaute proteins, indicating that they may have a potential role in the Argonaute-mediated RNA-interference pathway which mediates robust gene silencing in Entamoeba. Our results suggest that tRNA-derived fragments in Entamoeba have a possible role in regulating gene expression during environmental stress.",

    "abstract": "Microbes are present as communities in the environment. However, the importance of minor populations has not been well studied experimentally. In this study, we evaluated the role of Bacillus subtilis with a 1% population and its effect on co-incubated Enterococcus faecalis with a 99% population. Here we used an azo dye-decolorizing Enterococcus faecalis strain T6a1 and non-dye-decolorizing Bacillus subtilis strain S4ga. The dye decolorization assay enabled the investigation of the effects of B. subtilis S4ga on the activity of E. faecalis T6a1, even when B. subtilis S4ga was present at only 1% relative abundance or lower. We found that non-decolorizing B. subtilis S4ga enhanced the dye decolorization activity of E. faecalis T6a1, shortened the lag time of E. faecalis T6a1 to start decreasing the dye concentration, and increased the time for E. faecalis T6a1 to continue dye decolorization. These effects were correlated with redox potential values. We compared the extracellular amino acids between each incubation culture of E. faecalis T6a1 and B. subtilis S4ga, which revealed their mutual relationship by cross-feeding of specific amino acids. We also compared the intracellular primary metabolites between co-incubation and sole incubation of E. faecalis T6a1. The arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway in the co-incubated E. faecalis T6a1 was activated compared to that of E. faecalis T6a1 incubated solely. These findings explained that co-incubation with B. subtilis S4ga promoted ATP production in E. faecalis T6a1 cells to a greater extent and enhanced dye-decolorization activity.\n\nIMPORTANCEThis study highlights the importance of minor bacterial populations and their effects on major populations. We used Enterococcus faecalis as the major population and Bacillus subtilis as the minor population. Both species are becoming increasingly important. Some strains of E. faecalis are antibiotic-resistant pathogens, show probiotic effects, or are applicable for textile wastewater treatment. Some strains of B. subtilis are known to produce antimicrobial agents, reduce intestinal inflammation, or restore gut microbiota. We demonstrated that a low abundance of B. subtilis with 1% population increased the amount of energy produced by E. faecalis with 99% population, which appeared as enhanced dye decolorization activity of dye-decolorizing E. faecalis. Metabolomic analysis suggested that E. faecalis and B. subtilis had a mutual relationship by feeding specific amino acids to each other. These results provide new insights into co-existing minor populations in microbial communities and will improve our understanding of bacterial control.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=155 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/462685v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@950ce8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1826200org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f02e5forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@749e07_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Soil fungi facilitate the translocation of inorganic nutrients from soil minerals to other microorganisms and plants. This ability is particularly advantageous in impoverished soils, because fungal mycelial networks can bridge otherwise spatially disconnected and inaccessible nutrient hotspots. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying fungal mineral weathering and transport through soil remains poorly understood. Here, we addressed this knowledge gap by directly visualizing nutrient acquisition and transport through fungal hyphae in a mineral doped soil micromodel using a multimodal imaging approach. We observed that Fusarium sp. DS 682, a representative of common saprotrophic soil fungi, exhibited a mechanosensory response (thigmotropism) around obstacles and through pore spaces ([~]12 {micro}m) in the presence of minerals. The fungus incorporated and translocated potassium (K) from K-rich mineral interfaces, as evidenced by visualization of mineral derived nutrient transport and unique K chemical moieties following fungal induced mineral weathering. Specific membrane transport proteins were expressed in the presence of minerals, including those involved in oxidative phosphorylation pathways and transmembrane transport of small molecular weight organic acids. This study establishes the significance of fungal biology and nutrient translocation mechanisms in maintaining fungal growth under water and nutrient limitations in a soil-like microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Vaping of flavored liquids has been touted as safe alternative to traditional cigarette smoking with decreased health risks. The popularity of vaping has dramatically increased over the last decade, particularly among teenagers who incorporate vaping into their daily life as a social activity. Despite widespread and increasing adoption of vaping among young adults there is little information on long term consequences of vaping and potential health risks. This study demonstrates Vaping-Induced Pulmonary Injury (VAPI) using commercial JUUL pens with flavored vape juice using an inhalation exposure murine model. Profound pathological changes to upper airway, lung tissue architecture, and cellular structure are evident within 9 weeks of exposure. Marked histologic changes include increased parenchyma tissue density, cellular infiltrates proximal to airway passages, alveolar rarefaction, increased collagen deposition, and bronchial thickening with elastin fiber disruption.

    "abstract": "Epigenetic evolution occurs over million-year timescales in Cryptococcus neoformans and is mediated by DNMT5, the first maintenance-type cytosine methyltransferase identified in the fungal or protist kingdoms. DNMT5 requires ATP and displays exquisite hemimethyl-DNA specificity. To understand these novel properties, we solved cryo-EM structures of CnDNMT5 in three states. These studies reveal an elaborate allosteric cascade in which hemimethylated DNA first activates the SNF2 ATPase domain by a large rigid body rotation while the target cytosine partially flips out the DNA duplex. ATP binding then triggers a striking structural reconfiguration of the methyltransferase catalytic pocket that enables cofactor binding, completion of base-flipping, and catalysis. Unmethylated DNA binding fails to open cofactor pocket and subsequent ATP binding triggers its ejection to ensure fidelity. This chaperone-like, enzyme-remodeling role of the SNF2 domain illuminates how energy can be used to enable faithful epigenetic memory.\n\nHighlightsO_LIStructures of DNMT5 reveal mechanism of ATP-dependent DNA methylation\nC_LIO_LIHemimethylated CpG recognition triggers partial base flipping of the target cytosine\nC_LIO_LIHemimethylated DNA induces rigid body rotation to activate the SNF2 ATPase domain\nC_LIO_LIMTase catalytic pocket is remodeled by the SNF2 ATPase to achieve specificity\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Circadian rhythms are self-sustained physiological changes that drive rhythmicity within the 24-hours cycles. Posttranslational modifications (PMTs), such as protein phosphorylation, acetylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitination, are biochemical processes that modify protein structure and functions, ensuring circadian rhythm precision. For example, phosphorylation is considered the most important hallmark of rhythmicity from cyanobacteria to mammals. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) has been shown to regulate the mammalian SCNs circadian clock via phosphorylation of PER2. Here, we show that CDK5 influences the clock machinery assembling, using immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast as an in vitro model for studying the peripheral clock. In fact, the circadian period at the cellular level is lengthened. Furthermore, the clock-controlled genes expression amplitude is dampened in Cdk5 ko cell lines, while the phase is delayed about 4 hours.\n\nTaken together, we show in vitro that CDK5 is critically involved in regulating the peripheral clocks, influencing their temporal and spatial dynamics.",

Although several structures of drug efflux pumps are available, they provide only limited functional information on the phenomenon of drug efflux. Here, we performed deep mutational scanning (DMS) on the bacterial ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter EfrCD to determine the drug efflux activity profile of more than 1500 single variants. These systematic measurements revealed that the introduction of negative charges at different locations within the large substrate binding pocket results in strongly increased efflux activity towards positively charged ethidium, while additional aromatic residues did not display the same effect. Data analysis in the context of an inward-facing cryo-EM structure of EfrCD uncovered a high affinity binding site, which releases bound drugs through a peristaltic transport mechanism as the transporter transits to its outward-facing conformation. Finally, we identified substitutions resulting in rapid Hoechst influx without affecting the efflux activity for ethidium and daunorubicin. Hence, single mutations can convert the ABC exporter EfrCD into a drug-specific ABC importer.",

While prior studies have indicated that C-type inactivation involves structural changes at the selectivity filter, the nature of the changes have not been resolved. Here we report the crystal structure of the Kv1.2 channel in a C-type inactivated state. The structure shows that C-type inactivation involves changes in the selectivity filter that disrupt the outer two ion binding sites in the filter. The changes at the selectivity filter propagate to the extracellular mouth and the turret regions of the channel pore. The structural changes observed are consistent with the functional hallmarks of C-type inactivation.

    "abstract": "LetB is a tunnel-forming protein found in the cell envelope of some double-membraned bacteria, and is thought to be important for the transport of lipids between the inner and outer membranes. In Escherichia coli the LetB tunnel is formed from a stack of seven rings (Ring1 - Ring7), in which each ring is composed of a homo-hexameric assembly of MCE domains. The primary sequence of each MCE domain of the LetB protein is substantially divergent from the others, making each MCE ring unique in nature. The role of each MCE domain and how it contributes to the function of LetB is not well understood. Here we probed the importance of each MCE ring for the function of LetB, using a combination of bacterial growth assays and cryo-EM. Surprisingly, we find that {Delta}Ring3 and {Delta}Ring6 mutants, in which Ring3 and Ring6 have been deleted, confer increased resistance to membrane perturbing agents. Specific mutations in the pore-lining loops of Ring6 similarly confer increased resistance. A cryo-EM structure of the {Delta}Ring6 mutant shows that despite the absence of Ring6, which leads to a shorter assembly, the overall architecture is maintained, highlighting the modular nature of MCE proteins. Previous work has shown that Ring6 is dynamic and in its closed state, may restrict the passage of substrate through the tunnel. Our work suggests that removal of Ring6 may relieve this restriction. The deletion of Ring6 combined with mutations in the pore-lining loops leads to a model for the tunnel gating mechanism of LetB. Together, these results provide insight into the functional roles of individual MCE domains and pore-lining loops in the LetB protein.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDeleting MCE domains 3 or 6 from LetB confers increased resistance to membrane-perturbing agents\nC_LIO_LICryo-EM structure of {Delta}Ring6 LetB mutant highlights the modular nature of MCE domains\nC_LIO_LIMutations along LetB pore-lining loops modulate detergent resistance\nC_LI",

To address this, we explore the gene interaction networks of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae beyond pairwise interaction using the structural balance theory (SBT). Specifically, we ask whether essential and nonessential gene interaction networks are structurally balanced. We study triadic interactions in the weighted signed undirected gene networks and observe that balanced and unbalanced triads are over and underrepresented in both networks, thus beautifully in line with the strong notion of balance. Moreover, we note that the energy distribution of triads is significantly different in both essential and nonessential networks compared with the shuffled networks. Yet, this difference is greater in the essential network regarding the frequency as well as the energy of triads. Additionally, results demonstrate that triads in the essential gene network are more interconnected through sharing common links, while in the nonessential network they tend to be isolated. Last but not least, we investigate the contribution of all-length signed walks and its impact on the degree of balance. Our findings reveal that interestingly when considering longer cycles the nonessential gene network is more balanced compared to the essential network.",

We find that increasing the strength of interactions between protein and water by ca. 10% results in improved agreement with the SAXS data for IDPs and multi-domain proteins. We also show that this correction results in a more accurate description of self-association of IDPs and folded proteins and better agreement with paramagnetic relaxation enhancement data for most IDPs. While simulations with this revised force field still show deviations to experiments for some systems our results suggest that it is overall a substantial improvement for coarse-grained simulations of soluble proteins.",

This extremotolerant behavior has been attributed in part to repetitive, amphipathic, and intrinsically disordered proteins that are upregulated in the protected state. Here, we assemble a library of approximately 300 naturally-occurring and designed extremotolerance-associated proteins to assess their ability to protect human cells from chemically-induced apoptosis. We show that several proteins from tardigrades, nematodes, and the Chinese giant salamander are apoptosis protective. Notably, we identify a region of the human ApoE protein with similarity to extremotolerance-associated proteins that also protects against apoptosis. This region mirrors the phase separation behavior seen with such proteins, like the tardigrade protein CAHS2. Moreover, we identify a synthetic protein, DHR81, that shares this combination of elevated phase separation propensity and apoptosis protection. Finally, we demonstrate that driving protective proteins into the condensate state increases apoptosis protection, and highlight the ability for DHR81 condensates to sequester caspase-7. Taken together, this work draws a link between extremotolerance-associated proteins, condensate formation, and designing human cellular protection.",

    "abstract": "A major target of c-di-GMP signaling is the production of biofilm-associated extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which in Escherichia coli K-12 include amyloid curli fibres, phosphoethanolamine-modified (pEtN-)cellulose and poly-N-acetyl-glucosamine (PGA). However, the characterized c-di-GMP-binding effector systems are largely outnumbered by the 12 diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and 13 phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which synthetize and degrade c-di-GMP, respectively. E. coli possesses a single protein with a potentially c-di-GMP-binding MshEN domain, NfrB, which - together with the outer membrane protein NfrA - is known to serve as a receptor system for phage N4. Here, we show that NfrB not only binds c-di-GMP with high affinity, but as a novel c-di-GMP-controlled glycosyltransferase synthesizes a secreted EPS, which can impede motility and is required as an initial receptor for phage N4 infection. In addition, a systematic screening of the 12 DGCs of E. coli K-12 revealed that specifically DgcJ is required for the infection with phage N4 and interacts directly with NfrB. This is in line with local signaling models, where specific DGCs and/or PDEs form protein complexes with particular c-di-GMP effector/target systems. Our findings thus provide further evidence that intracellular signaling pathways, which all use the same diffusible second messenger, can act in parallel in a highly specific manner.\n\nImportanceKey findings in model organisms led to the concept of  local signaling, challenging the dogma of a gradually increasing global intracellular c-di-GMP concentration driving the motile-sessile transition in bacteria. In our current model, bacteria dynamically combine global as well as local signaling modes, in which specific DGCs and/or PDEs team up with effector/target systems in multiprotein complexes. Our present study highlights a novel example of how specificity in c-di-GMP signaling can be achieved by showing NfrB as a novel c-di-GMP binding effector in E. coli, which is controlled in a local manner specifically by DgcJ. We further show that NfrB (which was initially found as a part of a receptor system for phage N4) is involved in the production of a novel exopolysaccharide. Finally, our data shine new light on host interaction of phage N4, which uses this exopolysaccharide as an initial receptor for adsorption.",

    "abstract": "The ability of viruses to evade the host antiviral immune system determines their level of replication fitness, species specificity, and pathogenic potential. Flaviviruses rely on the subversion of innate immune barriers including the type I and type III IFN antiviral systems. Zika virus infection induces the degradation of STAT2, an essential component of the IFN stimulated gene transcription factor, ISGF3. The mechanisms that lead to STAT2 degradation by Zika virus are poorly understood, but it is known to be mediated by the viral NS5 protein that binds to STAT2 and targets it for proteasome-mediated destruction. To better understand how NS5 engages and degrades STAT2, functional analysis of the protein interactions that lead to Zika virus and NS5-dependent STAT2 proteolysis were investigated. Data implicate the STAT2 coiled-coil domain as necessary and sufficient for NS5 interaction and proteasome degradation after Zika virus infection. Molecular dissection reveals that the first two -helices of the STAT2 coiled-coil contain a specific targeting region for IFN antagonism. These functional interactions provide a more complete understanding of the essential protein-protein interactions needed for Zika virus evasion of the host antiviral response, and identifies new targets for antiviral therapeutic approaches.\n\nImportanceZika virus infection can cause mild fever, rash, and muscle pain, and in rare cases lead to brain or nervous system diseases including Guillain-Barre syndrome.

The LPM also gives rise to the mesodermal components of the trunk, flank and neck. However, the mesenchymal cells generated at these other axial levels cannot produce the variety of cell types found in the limb bud, nor can they be directed to form a patterned appendage-like structure, even when placed in the context of the signals responsible for organizing the limb bud. Here, by taking advantage of a direct reprogramming approach, we find a set of factors (Prdm16, Zbtb16, and Lin28) normally expressed in the early limb bud, that are capable of imparting limb progenitor-like properties to non-limb fibroblasts. Cells reprogrammed by these factors show similar gene expression profiles, and can differentiate into similar cell types, as endogenous limb progenitors. The further addition of Lin41 potentiates proliferation of the reprogrammed cells while suppressing differentiation. These results suggest that these same four key factors may play pivotal roles in the specification of endogenous limb progenitors.",

    "abstract": "Tropical agroecosystems have emerged from the continuous modification of natural environments, as a sustainability alternative for food production and biodiversity conservation. This work explores how the diversity of parasitoids is modified in environments where plant diversity is limited e.g. crops and when these are adjacent to secondary vegetation, i.e. a scenario fragmented continuously in a limited space. It was found that there is no direct effect of plant diversity in the group of parasitoids studied; but the number of specialist species is high, which indicates that in diversified agroecosystems these probably function as remnants of natural habitat or as a refuge for parasitoids that disperse to different types of management within the agroecosystem. Therefore, it is necessary to consider in future studies the controls exerted by the plant diversity effects bottom-up and consumer top-down. Adding to this the context of the interactions that occur in agroecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing is a prevalent diagnostic tool for undiagnosed diseases, and has played a significant role in rare disease gene discovery. While this technology resolves some cases, others are given a list of possibly damaging genetic variants necessitating functional studies. Productive collaborations between scientists, clinicians, and patients can help resolve such medical mysteries, and provide insights into in vivo function of human genes. Furthermore, facilitating interactions between scientists and research funders, including non-profit organizations or commercial entities, can dramatically reduce the time to translate discoveries from bench to bedside. Several systems designed to connect clinicians and researchers with a shared gene of interest have been successful. However, these platforms exclude some stakeholders based on their role or geography. Here we describe ModelMatcher, a global online matchmaking tool designed to facilitate cross-disciplinary collaborations, especially between scientists and other stakeholders of rare and undiagnosed disease research. ModelMatcher is integrated into the Rare Diseases Models and Mechanisms Network and Matchmaker Exchange, allowing users to identify potential collaborators in other registries. This living database decreases the time from when a scientist or clinician is making discoveries regarding their genes of interest, to when they identify collaborators and sponsors to facilitate translational and therapeutic research.",

    "abstract": "Coconut is the most important cash crop along the Coast of Kenya, yet its genetic diversity has not been fully established. A genetic diversity study of 48 coconut genotypes that were collected along the Coast of Kenya was conducted with 13 polymorphic short sequence repeats (SSRs) markers. SSR analysis was performed using GeneMapper while data analysis was done with PowerMarker and DARwin softwares.\n\nThe results revealed a total of 68 alleles ranging from 2 to 11 per locus with a mean of 5.23 per marker. Gene diversity and polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged between 0.41 to 0.83 and 0.33 to 0.79, respectively. A neighbour-joining dendrogram grouped the genotypes into three major clusters containing distinct sub-clusters. This study underscored that capillary electrophoresis is a more accurate and informative technique for SSRs allele scoring than agarose gels, which was reported in a previous study with the same SSRs markers and coconut genotypes in Kenya. The clusters observed forms the basis to isolate conservation blocks, which are the key to establishing a genebank, since there is no documented coconut genebank for ex-situ conservation in Kenya.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWith the advancement of NGS platform, large numbers of human variations and SNPs are discovered in human genomes. It is essential to utilize these massive nucleotide variations for the discovery of disease genes and human phenotypic traits. There are new challenges in utilizing such large numbers of nucleotide variants for polygenic disease studies. In recent years, deep-learning based machine learning approaches have achieved great successes in many areas, especially image classifications. In this preliminary study, we are exploring the deep convolutional neural network algorithm in genome-wide SNP images for the classification of human populations.\n\nResultsWe have processed the SNP information from more than 2,500 samples of 1000 genome project. Five major human races were used for classification categories. We first generated SNP image graphs of chromosome 22, which contained about one million SNPs. By using the residual network (ResNet 50) pipeline in CNN algorithm, we have successfully obtained classification models to classify the validation dataset. F1 scores of the trained CNN models are 95 to 99%, and validation with additional separate 150 samples indicates a 95.8% accuracy of the CNN model. Misclassification was often observed between the American and European categories, which could attribute to the ancestral origins. We further attempted to use SNP image graphs in reduced color representations or images generated by spiral shapes, which also provided good prediction accuracy. We then tried to use the SNP image graphs from chromosome 20, almost all CNN models failed to classify the human race category successfully, except the African samples.\n\nConclusionsWe have developed a human race prediction model with deep convolutional neural network. It is feasible to use the SNP image graph for the classification of individual genomes.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of complex skeletal traits in primates was likely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Because skeletal tissues are notoriously challenging to study using functional genomic approaches, they remain poorly characterized even in humans, let alone across multiple species. The challenges involved in obtaining functional genomic data from the skeleton, combined with the difficulty of obtaining such tissues from nonhuman apes, motivated us to consider an alternative in vitro system with which to comparatively study gene regulation in skeletal cell types. Specifically, we differentiated six human and six chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cell lines (iPSCs) into mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and subsequently into osteogenic cells (bone cells). We validated differentiation using standard methods and collected single-cell RNA sequencing data from over 100,000 cells across multiple samples and replicates at each stage of differentiation. While most genes that we examined display conserved patterns of expression across species, hundreds of genes are differentially expressed (DE) between humans and chimpanzees within and across stages of osteogenic differentiation. Some of these interspecific DE genes show functional enrichments relevant in skeletal tissue trait development. Moreover, topic modeling indicates that interspecific gene programs become more pronounced as cells mature. Overall, we propose that this in vitro model can be used to identify interspecific regulatory differences that may have contributed to skeletal trait differences between species.\n\nAuthor SummaryPrimates display a range of skeletal morphologies and susceptibilities to skeletal diseases, but the molecular basis of these phenotypic differences is unclear. Studies of gene expression variation in primate skeletal tissues are extremely restricted due to the ethical and practical challenges associated with collecting samples. Nevertheless, the ability to study gene regulation in primate skeletal tissues is crucial for understanding how the primate skeleton has evolved. We therefore developed a comparative primate skeletal cell culture model that allows us to access a spectrum of human and chimpanzee cell types as they differentiate from stem cells into bone cells. While most gene expression patterns are conserved across species, we also identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes between humans and chimpanzees within and across stages of differentiation. We also classified cells by osteogenic stage and identified additional interspecific differentially expressed genes which may contribute to skeletal trait differences. We anticipate that this model will be extremely useful for exploring questions related to gene regulation variation in primate bone biology and development.",

    "abstract": "A critical step in studying biological features (e.g., genetic variants, gene families, metabolic capabilities, or taxa) underlying traits or outcomes of interest is assessing their diversity and distribution. Accurate assessments of these patterns are essential for linking features to traits or outcomes and understanding their functional impact. Consequently, it is of crucial importance that the metrics employed for quantifying feature diversity can perform robustly under any evolutionary scenario. However, the standard metrics used for quantifying and comparing the distribution of features, such as prevalence, phylogenetic diversity, and related approaches, either do not take into consideration evolutionary history, or assume strictly vertical patterns of inheritance. Consequently, these approaches cannot accurately assess diversity for features that have undergone recombination or horizontal transfer. To address this issue, we have devised RecPD, a novel recombination-aware phylogenetic-diversity metric for measuring the distribution and diversity of features under all evolutionary scenarios. RecPD utilizes ancestral-state reconstruction to map the presence / absence of features onto ancestral nodes in a species tree, and then identifies potential recombination events in the evolutionary history of the feature. We also derive a number of related metrics from RecPD that can be used to assess and quantify evolutionary dynamics and correlation of feature evolutionary histories. We used simulation studies to show that RecPD reliably identifies evolutionary histories under diverse recombination and loss scenarios. We then apply RecPD in a real-world scenario in a preliminary study type III effector protein families secreted by the plant pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae and demonstrate that prevalence is an inadequate metric that obscures the potential impact of recombination. We believe RecPD will have broad utility for revealing and quantifying complex evolutionary processes for features at any biological level.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYPhylogenetic diversity is an important concept utilized in evolutionary ecology which has extensive applications in population genetics to help us understand how evolutionary processes have distributed genetic variation among individuals of a species, and how this impacts phenotypic diversification over time. However, existing approaches for studying phylogenetic diversity largely assume that the genetic features follow vertical inheritance, which is frequently violated in the case of microbial genomes due to horizontal transfer. To address this shortcoming, we present RecPD, a recombination-aware phylogenetic diversity metric, which incorporates ancestral state reconstruction to quantify the phylogenetic diversity of genetic features mapped onto a species phylogeny. Through simulation experiments we show that RecPD robustly reconstructs the evolutionary histories of features evolving under various scenarios of recombination and loss. When applied to a real-world example of type III secreted effector protein families from the plant pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae, RecPD reveals that horizontal transfer has played an important role in shaping the phylogenetic distributions of aa substantial proportion of families across the P. syringae species complex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the traditional measures of feature prevalence are unsuitable as a metric for comparing feature diversity.",

    "abstract": "Genome and transcriptome assemblies vary in their quality in terms of the connectedness of the assemblies and the amount of biological information captured. Interpreting de novo assemblies from new, poorly characterized, organisms in the context of complex traits can be challenging because, in the absence of a reference, it is difficult to know how much information is enough to claim the presence or absence of a trait. This study uses randomly downsampled proteome files to compare a genome completeness metric, BUSCO, to functional predictions of the complex trait of phagocytosis in known phagocytotic organisms broadly across the eukaryotic tree of life. We find that as additional proteins are added, BUSCO scores increase incrementally, while the phagocytosis prediction follows a sigmoidal curve. Generalizing our findings, we suggest a threshold of the number of BUSCOs detected above which one would expect an accurate prediction, positive or negative, of the complex trait of phagocytosis. While these findings are specific to a single trait, the methods can be extended to consider additional functional traits and predictive frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Environment structure often shapes social interactions. Spatial attractors that draw multiple individuals may play a particularly important role in dispersed groups, where individuals must first encounter one another to interact. We use GPS data recorded simultaneously from five spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) within a single clan to investigate how communal dens and daily ranging patterns shape fission-fusion dynamics (subgroup splits and merges). We introduce a species-general framework for identifying and characterizing dyadic fission-fusion events and describe a taxonomy of ten possible configurations of these events. Applying this framework to the hyena data illuminates the spatiotemporal structure of social interactions within hyenas daily routines. The most common types of fission-fusion events involve close approaches between individuals, do not involve co-travel together, and occur at the communal den. Comparison to permutation-based reference models suggests that den usage structures broad-scale patterns of social encounters, but that other factors influence how those encounters unfold. We discuss the dual role of communal dens in hyenas as physical and social resources, and suggest that dens are an example of a general \"social piggybacking\" process whereby environmental attractors take on social importance as reliable places to encounter conspecifics, causing social and spatial processes to become fundamentally intertwined.",

    "abstract": "Animals frequently forage in groups on ephemeral resources to profit from social information and increased efficiency. Greater spear-nosed bats (Phyllostomus hastatus) develop group-specific social calls, which are hypothesized to coordinate social foraging to feed on patchily-distributed balsa flowers. To test this, we tagged all members of three social groups of P. hastatus on Isla Colon, Panama, using high frequency GPS during a season when balsa had begun to flower. We found commuting distances of 20-30 km to foraging sites, more than double of what has been previously reported. In contrast to our expectations, we found that tagged individuals did not commute together, but did join group members in small foraging patches with high densities of flowering balsas on the mainland. We hypothesized that close proximity to group members would increase foraging efficiency if social foraging were used to find flower clusters, but distance between tagged individuals did not predict foraging efficiency or energy expenditure. However, decreased distance among tagged bat positively influenced time outside of the cave and increased the duration and synchrony of resting. These results suggest that social proximity seemed to be more important during resting, and indicate that factors other than increased feeding efficiency may structure social relationships of group members while foraging. It appears that, depending on the local resource landscape, these bats have an excellent map even of distant resources and may use social information only for current patch discovery. They then may no longer rely on social information during daily foraging.\n\nHighlightsO_LIUnlike in Trinidad, greater spear-nosed bats in Panama do not commute or forage as a group\nC_LIO_LIForaging distances are double of previously known and across the sea\nC_LIO_LIBats rest near each other, but do not forage more efficiently when close\nC_LIO_LISocial information may mainly be used for the discovery of feeding areas\nC_LIO_LILocal resource landscapes may cause strong variation in social behaviour\nC_LI",

Metyltetraprole (MTP) presents an exception as studies with phytopathogenic fungi showed that the inhibitor was unaffected by G143A. Here, we used the yeast model to investigate its mode of action. Analysis of bc1 complex mutants supports a Qo-site binding for MTP. However the compound seems distinct to other QoIs, such as azoxystrobin, in various ways, namely; 1) G143A was without effect on MTP, as previously reported. 2) The level of MTP resistance of mutants was higher in bc1 complex activity assays than in growth assays while the opposite was observed with azoxystrobin. 3) Steady-state kinetics used to characterise the mode of action of MTP also revealed differences compared to other QoIs.",

    "abstract": "In response to DNA damage, the ring-shaped 9-1-1 clamp is loaded onto 5 recessed DNA to arrest the cell cycle and activate the DNA damage checkpoint. The 9-1-1 clamp is a heterotrimeric ring that is loaded in S. cerevisiae by Rad24-RFC, an alternative clamp loader in which Rad24 replaces the Rfc1 subunit in the RFC1-5 clamp loader of PCNA. Unlike RFC that loads the PCNA ring onto a 3-ss/ds DNA junction, Rad24-RFC loads the 9-1-1 ring onto a 5-ss/ds DNA junction, a consequence of DNA damage. The underlying 9-1-1 clamp loading mechanism has been a mystery. Here we report two 3.2-[A] cryo-EM structures of Rad24-RFC bound to DNA and either a closed or 27 [A] open 9-1-1 clamp. The structures reveal a completely unexpected mechanism by which a clamp can be loaded onto DNA. The Rad24 subunit specifically recognizes the 5-DNA junction and holds ds DNA outside the clamp loader and above the plane of the 9-1-1 ring, rather than holding DNA inside and below the clamp as in RFC. The 3 ssDNA overhang is required to obtain the structure, and thus confers a second DNA binding site. The bipartite DNA binding by Rad24-RFC suggests that ssDNA may be flipped into the open 9-1-1 ring, similar to ORC-Cdc6 that loads the Mcm2-7 ring on DNA. We propose that entry of ssDNA through the 9-1-1 ring triggers the ATP hydrolysis and release of the Rad24-RFC. The key DNA binding residues are conserved in higher eukaryotes, and thus the 9-1-1 clamp loading mechanism likely generalizes.",

    "abstract": "Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) can cross the cell membrane to enter the cytosol and deliver otherwise non-penetrant macromolecules such as proteins and oligonucleotides. For example, recent clinical trials have shown that a CPP attached to phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) resulted in higher muscle concentration, increased exon-skipping and dystrophin production relative to another study of the PMO alone in patients of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Therefore, effective design and study of CPPs could help enhance therapies for difficult-to-treat diseases. So far, the study of CPPs for PMO delivery has been restricted to predominantly canonical L-peptides. We hypothesized that mirror-image D-peptides could have similar PMO delivery activity as well as enhanced proteolytic stability, facilitating their characterization and quantification from biological milieu. We found that several enantiomeric peptide sequences could deliver a PMO-biotin cargo with similar activities, while remaining stable against serum proteolysis. The biotin label allowed for affinity capture of fully intact PMO-peptide conjugates from whole cell and cytosolic lysates. By profiling a mixture of these constructs in cells, we determined their relative intracellular concentrations. When combined with PMO activity, these concentrations provide a new metric for delivery efficiency which may be useful for determining which peptide sequence to pursue in further pre-clinical studies.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=92 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/462617v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (12K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@887d8borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ea664aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e1b1e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1652d47_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Fetal bovine serum (FBS) is a widely used supplement in cell culture medium, despite its known variability in composition which greatly affects cellular function and consequently the outcome of studies. In bone tissue engineering, the deposited mineralized matrix is one of the main outcome parameters, but using different brands of FBS can result in large variations. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is present in FBS. Not only is ALP used to judge the osteogenic differentiation of bone cells, it may affect deposition of mineralized matrix. The present study focused on the enzymatic activity of ALP in FBS of different suppliers and its contribution to mineralization in osteogenic differentiation cultures. It was hypothesized that culturing cells in a medium with high intrinsic ALP activity of FBS will lead to higher mineral deposition compared to media with lower ALP activity. The used FBS types were shown to have significant differences in enzymatic ALP activity. Our results indicate that the ALP activity of the medium not only affected the deposited mineralized matrix but also the osteogenic differentiation of cells as measured by a changed cellular ALP activity of human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSC). In media with low inherent ALP activity, the cellular ALP activity was increased and played the major role in the mineralization process; while, in media with high intrinsic ALP activity contribution from the serum, less cellular ALP activity was measured and the ALP activity of the medium also contributed to mineral formation substantially. Our results highlight the diverse effects of ALP activity intrinsic to FBS on osteogenic differentiation and matrix mineralization and how FBS can determine the experimental outcomes, in particular for studies investigating matrix mineralization. Once again, the need to replace FBS with more controlled and known additives is highlighted.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=55 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/462693v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@902078org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@43b6fborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a244fborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5ef819_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound localization microscopy is a super-resolution imaging technique that exploits the unique characteristics of contrast microbubbles to side-step the fundamental trade-off between imaging resolution and penetration depth. However, the conventional reconstruction technique is confined to low microbubble concentrations to avoid localization and tracking errors. Several research groups have introduced sparsity- and deep learning-based approaches to overcome this constraint to extract useful vascular structural information from overlapping microbubble signals, but these solutions have not been demonstrated to produce blood flow velocity maps of the microcirculation. Here, we introduce Deep-SMV, a localization free super-resolution microbubble velocimetry technique, based on a long short-term memory neural network, that provides high imaging speed and robustness to high microbubble concentrations, and directly outputs blood velocity measurements at a super-resolution. Deep-SMV is trained efficiently using microbubble flow simulation on real in vivo vascular data and demonstrates real-time velocity map reconstruction suitable for functional vascular imaging and pulsatility mapping at super-resolution. The technique is successfully applied to a wide variety of imaging scenarios, include flow channel phantoms, chicken embryo chorioallantoic membranes, and mouse kidney, tumor, and brain imaging.",

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional structures of proteins are crucial for understanding their molecular mechanisms and interactions. Machine learning algorithms that are able to learn accurate representations of protein structures are therefore poised to play a key role in protein engineering and drug development. The accuracy of such models in deployment is directly influenced by training data quality. The use of different experimental methods for protein structure determination may introduce bias into the training data. In this work, we evaluate the magnitude of this effect across three distinct tasks: estimation of model accuracy, protein sequence design, and catalytic residue prediction. Most protein structures are derived from X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), or cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM); we trained each model on datasets consisting of either all three structure types or of only X-ray data. We find that across these tasks, models consistently perform worse on test sets derived from NMR and cryo-EM than they do on test sets of structures derived from X-ray crystallography, but that the difference can be mitigated when NMR and cryo-EM structures are included in the training set. Importantly, we show that including all three types of structures in the training set does not degrade test performance on X-ray structures, and in some cases even increases it. Finally, we examine the relationship between model performance and the biophysical properties of each method, and recommend that the biochemistry of the task of interest should be considered when composing training sets.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive B cell response is driven by the expansion, somatic hypermutation, and selection of B cell clones. A high number of clones in a B cell population indicates a highly diverse repertoire, while clonal size distribution and sequence diversity within clones can be related to antigens selective pressure. Identifying clones is fundamental to many repertoire studies, including repertoire comparisons, clonal tracking and statistical analysis. Several methods have been developed to group sequences from high-throughput B cell repertoire data. Current methods use clustering algorithms to group clonally-related sequences based on their similarities or distances. Such approaches create groups by optimizing a single objective that typically minimizes intra-clonal distances. However, optimizing several objective functions can be advantageous and boost the algorithm convergence rate. Here we propose a new method based on multi-objective clustering. Our approach requires V(D)J annotations to obtain the initial clones and iteratively applies two objective functions that optimize cohesion and separation within clones simultaneously. We show that under simulations with varied mutation rates, our method greatly improves clonal grouping as compared to other tools. When applied to experimental repertoires generated from high-throughput sequencing, its clustering results are comparable to the most performing tools. The method based on multi-objective clustering can accurately identify clone members, has fewer parameter settings and presents the lowest running time among existing tools. All these features constitute an attractive option for repertoire analysis, particularly in the clinical context to unravel the mechanisms involved in the development and evolution of B cell malignancies.",

PFINs are generally created by scoring the quality of interaction datasets against a Gold Standard dataset, usually chosen from a separate high-quality data source, prior to their integration. Use of an external Gold Standard has several drawbacks, including data redundancy, data loss and the need for identifier mapping, which can complicate the network build and impact on PFIN performance.\n\nResultsWe describe the development of an integration technique, ssNet, that scores and integrates both high-throughput and low-throughout data from a single source database in a consistent manner without the need for an external Gold Standard dataset. Using data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae we show that ssNet is easier and faster, overcoming the challenges of data redundancy, Gold Standard bias and ID mapping, while producing comparable performance. In addition ssNet results in less loss of data and produces a more complete network.\n\nConclusionsThe ssNet method allows PFINs to be built successfully from a single database, while producing comparable network performance to networks scored using an external Gold Standard source.",

    "abstract": "The volume of the cell nucleus varies across cell-types and species, and is commonly thought to be determined by the size of the genome and degree of chromatin compaction. However, this notion has been challenged over the years by multiple experimental evidence. Here, we consider the physical condition of mechanical force balance as a determining condition of the nuclear volume and use quantitative, order-of-magnitude analysis to estimate the forces from different sources of nuclear and cellular pressure. Our estimates suggest that the dominant pressure within the nucleus and cytoplasm originates from the osmotic pressure of proteins and RNA molecules that are localized to the nucleus or cytoplasm by out-of-equilibrium, active nucleocytoplasmic transport rather than from chromatin or its associated ions. This motivates us to formulate a physical model for the ratio of the cell and nuclear volumes in which osmotic pressures of localized proteins determine the relative volumes. In accordance with unexplained observations that are century-old, our model predicts that the ratio of the cell and nuclear volumes is a constant, robust to a wide variety of biochemical and biophysical manipulations, and is changed only if gene expression or nucleocytoplasmic transport are modulated.",

Here, we show that exposure of glioma stem cells (GSCs) to Chi3l1 reduces the CD133+/SOX2+ cells and increases the CD44+/Chi3l1+ cells. Chi3l1 binds to CD44 and induces phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, Akt and STAT3. Single cell RNA-seq and RNA velocity following incubation of GSCs with Chi3l1 show significant changes in GSC state dynamics driving GSCs towards a mesenchymal expression profile and reducing transition probabilities towards terminal cellular states. ATAC-seq reveals that Chi3l1 increases accessibility of promoters containing MAZ transcription factor footprint. Inhibition of MAZ directly regulates genes with highest expression in cellular clusters exhibiting significant cell state transitions. Finally, targeting Chi3l1 in vivo with a blocking antibody, resets the transcriptomic profile of glioblastoma and inhibits tumor growth.

    "abstract": "The high frequency of aberrant PI3K pathway activation in hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer has led to the development, clinical testing, and approval of the p110-selective PI3K inhibitor alpelisib. The limited clinical efficacy of alpelisib and other PI3K inhibitors is partially attributed to the functional antagonism between PI3K and estrogen receptor (ER) signaling, which is mitigated via combined PI3K inhibition and endocrine therapy. We and others have previously demonstrated a chromatin-associated mechanism by which PI3K supports cancer development and antagonizes ER signaling through the modulation of H3K4 methylation. Here we show that inhibition of the H3K4 histone methyltransferase MLL1 in combination with PI3K inhibition impairs HR+ breast cancer clonogenicity and cell proliferation. While combined PI3K/MLL1 inhibition reduces AKT effector signaling and H3K4 methylation, MLL1 inhibition increases PI3K effector signaling and upregulates the expression of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling cascades upstream of and including AKT. These data reveal a feedback loop between MLL1 and AKT in which MLL1 inhibition reactivates AKT. We additionally show that combined PI3K and MLL1 inhibition synergizes to cause cell death in in vitro and in vivo models of HR+ breast cancer, which is enhanced by the additional genetic ablation of the H3K4 methyltransferase and AKT target MLL4. Together, our data provide evidence of a feedback mechanism connecting histone methylation with AKT and may support the preclinical development and testing of pan-MLL inhibitors.\n\nSignificance StatementPharmacological inhibition of PI3K provides limited efficacy in PIK3CA-mutated, HR+ breast cancers. Here the authors leverage PI3K/AKT-driven chromatin modification to identify MLL histone methyltransferases as a therapeutic target. Dual PI3K and MLL inhibition synergize to reduce clonogenicity and cell proliferation while enhancing apoptosis in in vitro models, and induces tumor regression in xenograft models of PI3K-activated, HR+ breast cancer. Furthermore, MLL1 inhibition reveals a feedback loop leading to AKT hyperactivation, which is relieved with combined PI3K/MLL inhibition. These findings demonstrate the utility of MLL inhibitors for the treatment of some solid cancers, as patients with HR+ breast cancer characterized by PIK3CA mutation may derive clinical benefit from combined PI3K/MLL inhibition.",

EWS/FLI dysregulates transcription to induce and maintain sarcomagenesis, but the mechanisms utilized are not fully understood. We therefore sought to define the global effects of EWS/FLI on chromatin conformation and transcription in Ewing sarcoma. We found that EWS/FLI (and EWS/ERG) genomic localization is largely conserved across multiple patient-derived Ewing sarcoma cell lines. EWS/FLI binding is primarily associated with compartment activation, establishment of topologically-associated domain (TAD) boundaries, enhancer-promoter looping that involve both intra- and inter-TAD interactions, and gene activation. Importantly, local chromatin features provide the basis for transcriptional heterogeneity in regulation of direct EWS/FLI target genes across different Ewing sarcoma cell lines. These data demonstrate a key role of EWS/FLI in mediating genome-wide changes in chromatin configuration and support the notion that fusion transcription factors serve as master regulators through three-dimensional reprogramming of chromatin.",

Presence of niche-dependent physiological time cues has been proposed, allowing local tissues flexibility of phase adjustment. However, to date, such stimuli have remained elusive. Here we show that cycles of mechanical loading and osmotic stimuli within physiological range drive rhythmic expression of clock genes and reset clock phase and amplitude in cartilage and intervertebral disc tissues. Hyperosmolarity (not hypo-osmolarity) resets clocks in young and ageing skeletal tissues through mTORC2-AKT-GSK3{beta} pathway, leading to genome-wide induction of rhythmic genes. These results advocate diurnal patterns of mechanical loading and consequent daily surges in osmolarity as a bona fide tissue niche-specific time cue to maintain skeletal circadian rhythms in sync.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryCircadian clocks in aneural skeletal tissues sense the passage of time through rhythmic patterns of loading and osmolarity",

    "abstract": "Several genome-wide association studies have associated CACNA1C variants with psychiatric disorders. The molecular mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Taking advantage of the zebrafish larva as a model, we investigated how two different mutations in cacna1c - sa10930 (nonsense mutation) and sa15296 (splice site mutation), affect neuronal function. We characterized changes in cacna1c mRNA, neurotransmitter levels and behaviour, as well as whole-brain activity using single electrode local field potential recordings. Both point mutations resulted in a significant reduction in cacna1c mRNA, as well as social behaviour and prepulse inhibition deficits. Whereas sa15296 mutants displayed abnormal locomotor and open-field behaviour, we observed normal behaviour in the sa10930 mutants. Brain recordings from both mutants had lower spectral power while sa15296 displayed significant seizure-like activity. Finally, sa10930 homozygotes showed increased dopamine and serotonin levels, decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, and unchanged glutamate levels while homozygous sa15296 larvae showed increased levels of serotonin and glutamate, and unaffected levels of GABA and dopamine. Our work provides new insights into the functional role of CACNA1C in behavioural, electrophysiological and biochemical traits linked to psychiatric disorders. We show a functional role for the non-coding mutation (sa15296) in the cacna1c in vivo animal model. Consistent with existing hypotheses, our data suggest that disruption of gene expression, neurotransmission, and cortical excitability are involved in CACNA1C-related mechanisms of psychiatric disorders.",

A number of feeding mutants have been identified, including those with slow pharyngeal pumping rate, weak muscle contraction, defective muscle relaxation, and defective grinding of bacteria. Many aspects of these pharyngeal behavioral defects and how they affect pharyngeal function are not well understood. For example, the behavioral deficits underlying inefficient particle transport in  slippery mutants have been unclear. Here we use high speed video microscopy to describe pharyngeal pumping behaviors and particle transport in wild-type animals and in feeding mutants. Different  slippery mutants exhibit distinct defects including weak isthmus contraction, failure to trap particles in the anterior isthmus, and abnormal timing of contraction and relaxation in pharyngeal compartments. Our results show that multiple deficits in pharyngeal timing or contraction can cause defects in particle transport.",

Despite evidence indicating position-dependent therapeutic effects and distinct functions within the STN, input circuit and cellular profile in the STN remain largely unclear. Using advanced neuroanatomical techniques, we constructed a comprehensive connectivity map of the indirect and hyperdirect pathways in both the mouse and human STN. Our detailed circuit- and cellular-level connectivity revealed a topographically graded organization with three convergent types of indirect and hyperdirect-pathways. Furthermore, we identified two functional types of glutamatergic STN neurons (parvalbumin, PV +/- neurons) segregated with a topographical distribution. Glutamatergic PV+ STN neurons contribute to burst firing. We confirmed synaptic connectivity from indirect and hyperdirect pathways to both PV+ and PV-. These data suggest a complex interplay of information integration within the basal ganglia underlying coordinated movement control and therapeutic effects.",

    "abstract": "The ability to estimate and produce appropriately timed responses is central to many behaviors including speaking, dancing, and playing a musical instrument. A classical framework for estimating or producing a time interval is the pacemaker-accumulator model in which pulses of a pacemaker are counted and compared to a stored representation. However, the neural mechanisms for how these pulses are counted remains an open question. The presence of noise and stochasticity further complicate the picture. We present a biophysical model of how to keep count of a pacemaker in the presence of various forms of stochasticity using a system of bistable Wilson-Cowan units asymmetrically connected in a one-dimensional array; all units receive the same input pulses from a central clock but only one unit is active at any point in time. With each pulse from the clock, the position of the activated unit changes thereby encoding the total number of pulses emitted by the clock. This neural architecture maps the counting problem into the spatial domain, which in turn translates count to a time estimate. We further extend the model to a hierarchical structure to be able to robustly achieve higher counts.",

    "abstract": "Mechanosensory transduction (MT), the conversion of mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, underpins hearing and balance and is carried out within hair cells in the inner ear. Hair cells harbor actin-filled stereocilia, arranged in rows of descending heights, where the tips of stereocilia are connected to their taller neighbors by a filament composed of protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) and cadherin 23 (CDH23), deemed the  tip-link. Tension exerted on the tip-link opens an ion channel at the tip of the shorter stereocilia, thus converting mechanical force into an electrical signal. While biochemical and structural studies have provided insights into the molecular composition and structure of isolated portions of the tip-link, the architecture, location and conformational states of intact tip-links, on stereocilia, remains unknown. Here we report in situ cryo-electron microscopy imaging of the tip-link in mouse stereocilia. We observe individual PCDH15 molecules at the tip and shaft of stereocilia and determine their stoichiometry, conformational heterogeneity, and their complexes with CDH23. The PCDH15/CDH23 complexes occur in clusters, frequently with more than one copy of PCDH15 at the tip of stereocilia, suggesting that tip-links might consist of more than one copy of the PCDH15/CDH23 heterotetramer and by extension, might include multiple MT complexes.",

    "abstract": "Although the engagement of sensorimotor cortices in movement is well documented, the functional relevance of brain activity patterns remains ambiguous. Especially, the cortical engagement specific to the pre-, within-, and post-movement periods is poorly understood. The present study addressed this issue by examining sensorimotor EEG activity during the performance as well as STOP-signal cued suppression of movements pertaining to two distinct classes, namely, discrete vs. ongoing rhythmic movements. Our findings indicate that the lateralized readiness potential (LRP), which is classically used as a marker of pre-movement processing, indexes multiple pre- and in-movement-related brain dynamics in a movement-class dependent fashion. In- and post-movement event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) observed in the Mu (8-13 Hz) and Beta (15-30 Hz) frequency ranges were associated with estimated brain sources in both motor and somatosensory cortical areas. Notwithstanding, Beta ERS occurred earlier following cancelled than actually performed movements. In contrast, Mu power did not vary. Whereas Beta power may reflect the evaluation of the sensory predicted outcome, Mu power might engage in linking perception to action. Additionally, the rhythmic movement forced stop (only) showed a post-movement Mu/Beta rebound, which might reflect an active \"clearing-out\" of the motor plan and its feedback-based online control. Overall, the present study supports the notion that sensorimotor EEG modulations are key markers to investigate control or executive processes, here initiation and inhibition, which are exerted when performing distinct movement classes.",

    "abstract": "Patient-derived organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells have emerged as a model for studying human diseases beyond conventional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture. Briefly, these three-dimensional organoids are highly complex, capable of self-organizing, recapitulate cellular architecture, and have the potential to model diseases in complex organs, such as the brain. For example, the hallmark of Parkinsons disease - proteostatic dysfunction leading to the selective death of neurons in the substantia nigra - present a subtle distinction in cell type specificity that is simply lost in 2D cell culture models. As such, the development of robust methods to study global proteostasis and protein turnover in organoids will remain a critical need as organoid models evolve. To solve this problem, we have designed a workflow to extract proteins from organoids and measure global protein turnover using mass spectrometry and stable isotope labeling using amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). This allowed us to measure the turnover rates of 844 proteins and compare protein turnover to previously reported data in primary cell cultures and in vivo models. Taken together, this method will facilitate the study of proteostasis in organoid models of human disease and will provide an analytical and statistical framework to measure protein turnover in organoids of all cell types.",

    "abstract": "Animals can rapidly adapt their movements to external perturbations. This adaptation is paralleled by changes in single neuron activity in the motor cortices. Behavioural and neural recording studies suggest that when animals learn to counteract a visuomotor perturbation, these changes originate from altered inputs to the motor cortices rather than from changes in local connectivity, as neural covariance is largely preserved during adaptation. Since measuring synaptic changes in vivo remains very challenging, we used a modular recurrent network model to compare the expected neural activity changes following learning through altered inputs (Hinput) and learning through local connectivity changes (Hlocal). Learning under Hinput produced small changes in neural activity and largely preserved the neural covariance, in good agreement with neural recordings in monkeys. Surprisingly given the presumed dependence of stable neural covariance on preserved circuit connectivity, Hlocal led to only slightly larger changes in neural activity and covariance compared to Hinput. This similarity is due to Hlocal only requiring small, correlated connectivity changes to counteract the perturbation, which provided the network with significant robustness against simulated synaptic noise. Simulations of tasks that impose increasingly larger behavioural changes revealed a growing difference between Hinput and Hlocal, which could be exploited when designing future experiments.",

    "abstract": "Over two decades ago acellular pertussis vaccines (aP) replaced whole cell pertussis vaccines (wP) in several countries. Since then, a resurgence in pertussis has been observed, which is hypothesized to be linked to waning immunity. To better understand why waning immunity occurs, we developed a long-term outbred CD1 mouse model to conduct the longest murine pertussis vaccine studies to date, spanning out to 532 days post primary immunization. Vaccine-induced memory results from follicular responses and germinal center formation; therefore, cell populations and cytokines involved with memory were measured alongside protection from challenge. Both aP and wP immunization elicit protection from intranasal challenge and generation of pertussis specific antibody responses in mice. Responses to wP vaccination were characterized by a significant increase in T follicular helper cells in the draining lymph nodes and CXCL13 levels in sera compared to aP mice. In addition, a population of B. pertussis+ memory B cells was found to be unique to wP vaccinated mice. This population peaked post-boost, and was measurable out to day 365 post-vaccination. Anti-B. pertussis and anti-pertussis toxoid antibody secreting cells increased one day after boost and remained high at day 532. The data suggest that follicular responses, and in particular CXCL13 levels in sera, should be monitored in pre-clinical and clinical studies for the development of the next-generation pertussis vaccines.",

Synthesized sphingolipid analogs can induce cell death in human lymphocytes and leukemia cells. By screening a group of synthetic sphingolipid analogs, we found that low concentrations of AD2750 and AD2646 induced cell death in human cancer cells by preventing ceramide from converting to sphingomyelin, individually or in combination with commercial cancer drugs. The combination of low concentrations of Taxol and AD2750 or AD2646 significantly increased cell death on human colon cancer cells (HT29). Co-administering low concentrations of Doxorubicin with AD2750 or AD2646 elevated cellular toxicity on human pancreatic cancer cells (CRL1687). This synergistic effect is related to the elevated cellular ceramide. Combining AD2750 or AD2646 with chemotherapy drugs can be used to manipulate ceramide and sphingomyelin metabolism, potentially to affect the growth of human cancer cells and increase the effectiveness of anti-cancer drugs on killing cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Mast cell accumulation is a hallmark of a number of diseases including allergic asthma and systemic mastocytosis. IgE-mediated crosslinking of the Fc{varepsilon}RI receptors causes mast cell activation and contributes to disease pathogenesis. The mast cell lineage is one of the least studied among the hematopoietic cell lineages and there are still controversies about the identity of the mast cell progenitor, i.e., whether Fc{varepsilon}RI expression appears during the hematopoietic progenitor stage or in maturing mast cells. Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics to reveal a temporal association between the appearance of Fc{varepsilon}RI and the mast cell gene signature in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors. In agreement with these data, the Fc{varepsilon}RI+ hematopoietic progenitors formed morphologically, phenotypically and functionally mature mast cells in long-term culture assays. Single-cell transcriptomics analysis further revealed the expression patterns of prospective cytokine receptors regulating mast cell progenitor development. Culture assays showed that IL-3 and IL-5 promoted disparate effects on progenitor cell proliferation and survival, respectively, whereas IL-33 caused robust Fc{varepsilon}RI downregulation. Taken together, we have demonstrated that Fc{varepsilon}RI appears during the hematopoietic progenitor stage of mast cell differentiation and that external stimuli may regulate the Fc{varepsilon}RI expression. Thus, the results resolve the controversy regarding the appearance of Fc{varepsilon}RI during mast cell development.\n\nOne-sentence summarySingle-cell analysis of human hematopoiesis uncovers the stage at which Fc{varepsilon}RI appears during mast cell differentiation and reveals disparate effects of IL-3, IL-5 and IL-33 on mast cell progenitor proliferation, survival, and suppression of Fc{varepsilon}RI expression.",

    "abstract": "JADE family proteins (JADE1/2/3) have been implicated in diverse cellular functions and signaling pathways ranging from WNT signaling and cell cycle control to cell death and complex transcriptional regulation through histone acetyl-transferase complexes. JADE proteins show a high degree of sequence similarity and share two PHD zinc finger domains. JADE1 interacts with cilia-associated proteins and has been implicated in cilia-related genetic disorders with kidney phenotypes. However, the function of the widely expressed JADE proteins at the molecular level is still elusive. Here we show that JADE proteins regulate proteasome abundance and activity. Using kidney cells as a model, we demonstrate that loss of either JADE protein resulted in increased expression of almost all components of the 26S proteasome. Regulation occurred at the post-translational level and was not the consequence of transcriptional activation. Consistent with a role for JADE proteins in regulating overall proteasomal abundance, proteasomal activity was elevated in Jade-deficient cells, while exogenous expression of JADE1/2/3 decreased the level of proteasome activity. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interaction of proteasomal subunits with Jade1 suggesting a direct role of JADE proteins in regulating turnover, stability and abundance of the 26s proteasome. These data may now explain the plethora of cellular roles that have been attributed to JADE proteins.",

    "abstract": "During early stages of ischemic brain injury, glutamate receptor hyperactivation mediates neuronal death via osmotic cell swelling. Here we show that ischemia and excess NMDA receptor activation - conditions that trigger neuronal swelling -- cause actin filaments to undergo a rapid and extensive reorganization within the somatodendritic compartment. Normally, F-actin is concentrated within dendritic spines, with relatively little F-actin in the dendrite shaft. However, beginning <5 min after incubation of neurons with NMDA, F-actin depolymerizes within dendritic spines and polymerizes into long, stable filament bundles within the dendrite shaft and soma. A similar \"actinification\" of the somatodendritic compartment occurs after oxygen/glucose deprivation in vitro, and in mouse brain after photothrombotic stroke in vivo. Following transient, sub-lethal NMDA exposure these actin changes spontaneously reverse within 1-2 hours. A combination of Na+, Cl-, water, and Ca2+ entry are all necessary, but not individually sufficient, for induction of actinification. Spine F-actin depolymerization is also required. Actinification is driven by activation of the F-actin polymerization factor inverted formin-2 (INF2). Silencing of INF2 renders neurons more vulnerable to NMDA-induced membrane leakage and cell death, and formin inhibition markedly increases ischemic infarct severity in vivo. These results show that ischemia-induced actin filament reorganization within the dendritic compartment is an intrinsic pro-survival response that protects neurons from death induced by swelling.",

    "abstract": "Human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) have emerged as a powerful tool to model early placental development in vitro. Analogous to the epithelial cytotrophoblast in the placenta, hTSCs can differentiate into cells of the extravillous trophoblast (EVT) lineage or the multinucleate syncytiotrophoblast (STB). Here we present a chemically defined culture system for STB and EVT differentiation of hTSCs. Notably, in contrast to current approaches, we do not utilize transforming growth factor-beta inhibitors or a passage step for EVT differentiation, or forskolin for STB formation. Strikingly, under these conditions, presence of a single additional extracellular cue - lam-inin-1 - switched the terminal differentiation of hTSCs from STB to the EVT lineage. Activation of the sphingosine-1 receptor 3 receptor (S1PR3) using a chemical agonist could drive EVT differentiation of hTSCs in the absence of exogenous laminin, albeit less efficiently. To illustrate the utility of a chemically defined culture system for mechanistic studies, we examined the role of protein kinase C (PKC) signaling during hTSC differentiation to the EVT lineage. Inhibition of PKC/{beta} signaling significantly reduced HLA-G expression and the formation of HLA-G+ mesen-chymal EVTs during hTSC differentiation mediated by laminin exposure; however, it did not prevent commitment to the EVT lineage or STB differentiation. The chemically defined culture system for hTSC differentiation established herein facilitates quantitative analysis of heterogeneity that arises during hTSC differentiation, and will enable mechanistic studies in vitro.\n\nSignificanceDespite its importance to a healthy pregnancy, early human placental development remains poorly understood. Mechanistic studies are impeded by restrictions on research with human embryos and fetal tissues, and significant differences in placentation between humans and commonly used animal models. In this context, human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) have emerged as attractive in vitro models for the epithelial cytotrophoblast of the early gestation human placenta. Here we describe chemically defined culture conditions for differentiation of hTSCs to the two major differentiated cell types - extravillous trophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast. These culture conditions enable in vitro studies to reveal molecular mechanisms regulating hTSC differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the ecological processes that maintain community function in systems experiencing species loss, and how these processes change over time, is key to understanding the relationship between community structure and function and predicting how communities may respond to perturbations in the Anthropocene. Using a 30-year experiment on desert rodents, we show that the impact of species loss on community-level energy use has changed repeatedly and dramatically over time, due to 1) the addition of new species to the community, and 2) a reduction in functional redundancy among the same set of species. Although strong compensation, initially driven by the dispersal of functionally redundant species to the local community, occurred in this system from 1997-2010, since 2010, compensation has broken down due to decreasing functional overlap within the same set of species. Simultaneously, long-term changes in sitewide community composition due to niche complementarity have decoupled the dynamics of compensation from the overall impact of species loss on community-level energy use. Shifting, context-dependent compensatory dynamics, such as those demonstrated here, highlight the importance of explicitly long-term, metacommunity, and eco-evolutionary perspectives on the link between species-level fluctuations and community function in a changing world.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which species ranges reflect intrinsic physiological tolerances is a major, unsolved question in evolutionary ecology. To date, consensus has been hindered by the limited tractability of experimental approaches across most of the tree of life. Here, we apply a macrophysiological approach to understand how hematological traits related to oxygen transport shape elevational ranges in a tropical biodiversity hotspot. Along Andean elevational gradients, we measured traits that affect blood oxygen-carrying capacity--total and cellular hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit--for 2,355 individuals of 136 bird species. We used these data to evaluate the influence of hematological traits on elevational ranges. First, we asked whether hematological plasticity is predictive of elevational range breadth. Second, we asked whether variance in hematological traits changed as a function of distance from the midpoint of the elevational range. We found that the correlation between hematological plasticity and elevational range breadth was slightly positive, consistent with a facilitative role for plasticity in elevational range expansion. We further found reduced local variation in hematological traits near elevational range limits and at high elevations, patterns consistent with intensified natural selection, reduced effective population size, or compensatory changes in other cardiohematological traits with increasing distance from species-specific optima for oxygen availability. Our findings suggest that constraints on hematological plasticity and local genetic adaptation to oxygen availability promote the evolution of the narrow elevational ranges that underpin tropical montane biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "The number of people in food crisis around the world is increasing, exacerbated by the challenges of COVID-19 and a rapidly changing climate. Major crop yields are projected to decrease in low-latitude regions due to anthropogenic climate change, making tropical and sub-tropical food systems particularly vulnerable to climate shocks. Increased cultivation of breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis), often categorized as a neglected and underutilized species (NUS), has been suggested as an agricultural adaptation pathway for food insecure tropical and subtropical regions, due to its potential to enhance climate resilience and overall sustainability of low-latitude agricultural systems. To better understand breadfruits cultivation suitability and geographic range in current and future climates, we employ a diverse set of observations and models to delineate the current climatically viable breadfruit range and assess the climatically viable breadfruit range in the future (2061-2080) under stabilization and high emission scenarios. We find that the area of suitable breadfruit range within the tropics and subtropics is projected to decrease ~4.4% in the stabilization scenario and ~4.5% in the high emission scenario. In Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, yield quality and consistency show minimal decreases under the high emission scenario, with increases in total suitable area under both scenarios. In contrast, in Latin America and the Caribbean, the current range of breadfruit suitability is projected to contract ~10.1-11.5% (stabilization-high emission). Present and future model suitability outputs suggest that opportunities to successfully expand breadfruit cultivation over the next several decades exist in sub-Saharan Africa, where food insecurity is coincidentally high. However, in all regions, high emission scenario conditions reduce the overall consistency and quality of breadfruit yields compared to the stabilization scenario. Our results have the potential to inform global food security adaptation planning and highlight breadfruit as an ideal NUS to incorporate in food security adaptation strategies in a changing climate.",

    "abstract": "The human gut microbiome harbors substantial ecological diversity at the species level, as well as at the strain level within species. In healthy hosts, species abundance fluctuations in the microbiome are thought to be stable, and these fluctuations can be described by macroecological laws. However, it is less clear how strain abundances change over time. An open question is whether individual strains behave like species themselves, exhibiting stability and following the macroecological relationships known to hold at the species level, or whether strains have different dynamics, perhaps due to the relatively close phylogenetic relatedness of co-colonizing lineages. Here, we analyze the daily dynamics of intra-specific genetic variation in the gut microbiomes of four healthy, densely longitudinally sampled hosts. First, we find that overall genetic diversity in a large majority of species is stationary over time, despite short-term fluctuations. Next, we show that fluctuations in abundances in approximately 80% of strains analyzed can be predicted with a stochastic logistic model (SLM)--an ecological model of a population experiencing environmental fluctuations around a fixed carrying capacity which has previously been shown to capture statistical properties of species abundance fluctuations. The success of this model indicates that strain abundances typically fluctuate around a fixed carrying capacity, suggesting that most strains are dynamically stable. Finally, we find that the strain abundances follow several empirical macroecological laws known to hold at the species level. Together, our results suggest that macroecological properties of the human gut microbiome, including its stability, emerge at the level of strains.",

    "abstract": "Cattle are an important livestock species, and mapping the genomic architecture of agriculturally relevant traits such as disease susceptibility is a major challenge in the bovine research community. Lineage-specific transposable elements (TEs) are increasingly recognized to contribute to gene regulatory evolution and variation, but this possibility has been largely unexplored in ruminant genomes. We conducted epigenomic profiling of the type II interferon (IFN) response in bovine cells, and found thousands of ruminant-specific TEs including MER41_BT and Bov-A2 elements predicted to act as IFN-inducible enhancer elements. CRISPR knockout experiments in bovine cells established that critical immune factors including IFNAR2 and IL2RB are transcriptionally regulated by TE-derived enhancers. Finally, population genomic analysis of 38 individuals revealed that a subset of TE-derived enhancers represent polymorphic insertion sites in modern cattle. Our study reveals that lineage-specific TEs have shaped the evolution of ruminant IFN responses, and potentially continue to contribute to immune gene regulatory differences across modern breeds and individuals. Together with previous work in human cells, our findings demonstrate that lineage-specific TEs have been independently co-opted to regulate IFN-inducible gene expression in multiple species, supporting TE co-option as a recurrent mechanism driving the evolution of IFN-inducible transcriptional networks.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia are among the most prevalent and widespread endosymbiotic bacteria on earth. Wolbachia s success in infecting an enormous number of arthropod species is attributed to two features: the range of phenotypes they induce in their hosts, and their ability to switch to new host species. Whilst much progress has been made in elucidating the phenotypes induced by Wolbachia, our understanding of Wolbachia host shifting is still very limited: we lack answers to even fundamental questions concerning Wolbachias routes of transfer and the importance of factors influencing host shifts. Here, we investigate the diversity and host-shift patterns of Wolbachia in scale insects, a group of arthropods with intimate associations with other insects that make them well-suited to studying host shifts. Using Illumina pooled amplicon sequencing of Wolbachia-infected scale insects and their direct associates we determined the identity of all Wolbachia strains, revealing that 32% of samples were multiply infected (with up to five distinct strains per species). We then fitted a Generalised Additive Mixed Model (GAMM) to our data to estimate the influence of factors such as the host phylogeny and the geographic distribution of each species on Wolbachia strain sharing among scale insect species. The model predicts no significant contribution of host geography but strong effects of host phylogeny, with high rates of Wolbachia sharing among closely related species and a sudden drop-off in sharing with increasing phylogenetic distance. We also detected the same Wolbachia strain in scale insects and several intimately associated species (ants, wasps, beetles, and flies). This indicates putative host shifts and potential routes of transfers via these associates and highlights the importance of ecological connectivity in Wolbachia host-shifting.",

    "abstract": "Spectral tuning of visual pigments often facilitates adaptation to new environments, and it is intriguing to study the visual ecology of pelagic sharks with expanded habitats. The whale shark, which dives into the deep sea of nearly 2,000 meters besides near-surface filter-feeding, was previously shown to possesses the  blue-shifted rhodopsin (RHO). In this study, our spectroscopy of recombinant whale shark RHO mutants revealed the dominant effect of the novel spectral tuning amino acid site 94, which is implicated in congenital stationary night blindness of humans, accounting for the blue shift. Thermal decay profiling revealed the reduction of the thermal stability of whale shark RHO, as typically observed for cone opsins, which was experimentally shown to be achieved by the site 178, as well as 94. The results suggest that these two sites cooperatively enhance the visual capacity in both the deep sea and the sea surface, enabling exceptionally wide vertical migration of this species.",

Short-read RNA sequencing approaches fail to resolve RNA isoforms and therefore primarily enable gene expression measurements - an isoform unaware representation of the transcriptome. Conversely, full-length RNA sequencing using long-read technologies are able to capture complete transcript isoforms, but their utility is deeply constrained due to throughput limitations. Here, we introduce MAS-ISO-seq, a technique for programmably concatenating cDNAs into single molecules optimal for long-read sequencing, boosting the throughput >15 fold to nearly 40 million cDNA reads per run on the Sequel IIe sequencer. We validated unambiguous isoform assignment with MAS-ISO-seq using a synthetic RNA isoform library and applied this approach to single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor-infiltrating T cells. Results demonstrated a >30 fold boosted discovery of differentially spliced genes and robust cell clustering, as well as canonical PTPRC splicing patterns across T cell subpopulations and the concerted expression of the associated hnRNPLL splicing factor. Methods such as MAS-ISO-seq will drive discovery of novel isoforms and the transition from gene expression to transcript isoform expression analyses.",

    "abstract": "Plant-parasitic nematodes are a major, and in some cases a dominant, threat to crop production in all agricultural systems. The relative scarcity of classical resistance genes highlights a pressing need to identify new ways to develop nematode-resistant germplasm. Here, we sequence and assemble a high-quality genome of the model cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii to provide a platform for the first system-wide dual analysis of host and parasite gene expression over time, covering all major stages of the interaction. This novel approach enabled the analysis of the hologenome of the infection site, to identify metabolic pathways that were incomplete in the parasite but complemented by the host. Using a combination of bioinformatic, genetic, and biochemical approaches, we show that the highly atypical completion of vitamin B5 biosynthesis by the parasitic animal, putatively enabled by a horizontal gene transfer from a bacterium, is critically important for parasitism. Knockout of either the plant-encoded or the now nematode-encoded steps in the pathway blocks parasitism. Our experiments establish a reference for cyst nematodes, use this platform to further our fundamental understanding of the evolution of plant-parasitism by nematodes, and show that understanding congruent differential expression of metabolic pathways represents a new way to find nematode susceptibility genes, and thereby, targets for future genome editing-mediated generation of nematode-resistant crops.",

It is mainly caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the BLM gene, which encodes the BLM helicase, acting in DNA replication and repair processes. Here, we describe the gene expression profiles of three BS fibroblast cell lines harboring causative, biallelic truncating mutations obtained by single-cell (sc) transcriptome analysis. We compared the scRNA transcription profiles from three BS patient cell lines to two age-matched wild-type controls and observed specific deregulation of gene sets related to the molecular processes characteristically affected in BS, such as mitosis, chromosome segregation, cell cycle regulation, and genomic instability. We also found specific upregulation of genes of the Fanconi anemia pathway, in particular FANCM, FANCD2, and FANCI, which encode known interaction partners of BLM. The significant deregulation of genes associated with inherited forms of primary microcephaly observed in our study might explain in part the molecular pathogenesis of microcephaly in BS, one of the main clinical characteristics in patients. Finally, our data provide first evidence of a novel link between BLM dysfunction and transcriptional changes in condensin complex I and II genes. Overall, our study provides novel insights into gene expression profiles in BS on a single-cell level, linking specific genes and pathways to BLM dysfunction.",

We have previously reported that this polymorphism is a modifier of dystrophin deficient Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. To investigate the mechanism underlying this we use a double knockout (dk)Actn3KO/mdx (dKO) mouse model which lacks both dystrophin and sarcomere -actinin-3. We used dKO mice and mdx dystrophic mice at 12 months (aged) to investigate the correlation between morphological changes to the fast-twitch dKO EDL and the reduction in force deficit produced by an in vitro eccentric contraction protocol. In the aged dKO mouse we found a marked reduction in fibre branching complexity that correlated with protection from eccentric contraction induced force deficit. Complex branches in the aged dKO EDL fibres (28%) were substantially reduced compared to aged mdx EDL fibres (68%) and this correlates with a graded force loss over three eccentric contractions for dKO muscles ([~]35% after first contraction, [~]66% overall) compared to an abrupt drop in mdx upon the first eccentric contraction ([~]73% after first contraction, [~]89% after three contractions). In dKO protection from eccentric contraction damage was linked with a doubling of SERCA1 pump density the EDL. We propose that the increased oxidative metabolism of fast-twitch glycolytic fibres characteristic of the null polymorphism (R577X) and increase in SR Ca2+ pump proteins reduces muscle fibre branching and decreases susceptibility to eccentric injury in the dystrophinopathies.",

Understanding the mechanisms underlying the diversity of coat colors and their inheritance is important for professional breeders because it helps to predict the phenotypes of the progeny. Although genetics of the main coat colors in dogs is extensively studied, there are types of coat pigmentation that are not explained yet. Recently a new model connected the variants in ASIP gene promoters with different coat colors in dogs. Here we used this model as a framework to investigate the genetics of the rare sesame coat color in Shiba Inu dogs. We determined the combination of two alleles of ASIP gene that determine sesame coat color. This finding can be used by the breeders to produce the dogs with this rare coat color pattern. We also demonstrate the incomplete dominance between the ASIP alleles involved in sesame coat formation. These results are in good agreement with the new model explaining how different levels of ASIP gene expression affect the regulation of pigment synthesis in melanocytes.",

    "abstract": "The white-blotched river stingray (Potamotrygon leopoldi) is a cartilaginous fish native to the Xingu River, a tributary of the Amazon River system. It possesses a lot of unique biological features such as disc-like body shape, bizarre color pattern and living in freshwater habitat while most stingrays and their close relatives are sea dwellers. As a member of the Potamotrygonidae family, P. leopoldi bears evolutionary signification in fish phylogeny, niche adaptation and skeleton formation. In this study, we present its draft genome of 4.11 Gb comprised of 16,227 contigs and 13,238 scaffolds, which has contig N50 of 3,937 kilobases and scaffold N50 of 5,675 kilobases in size. Our analysis shows that P. leopoldi is a slow-evolving fish, diverged from elephant shark about 96 million years ago. We find that two gene families related to immune system, immunoglobulin heavy constant delta genes, and T-cell receptor alpha/delta variable genes, stand out expanded in P. leopoldi only, suggesting robustness in response to freshwater pathogens in adapting novel environments. We also identified the Hox gene clusters in P. leopoldi and discovered that seven Hox genes shared by five representative fishes are missing in P. leopoldi. The RNA-seq data from P. leopoldi and other three fish species demonstrate that fishes have a more diversified tissue expression spectrum as compared to the corresponding mammalian data. Our functional studies suggest that the lack of genes encoding vitamin D-binding protein in cartilaginous (both P. leopoldi and Callorhinchus milii) fishes could partly explain the absence of hard bone in their endoskeleton. Overall, this genome resource provides new insights into the niche-adaptation, body plan and skeleton formation of P. leopoldi as well as the genome evolution in cartilaginous fish.",

    "abstract": "Genetic studies of complex disorders such as autism and intellectual disability (ID) are often based on enrichment of individual rare variants or their aggregate burden in affected individuals compared to controls. However, these studies overlook the influence of combinations of rare variants that may not be deleterious on their own due to statistical challenges resulting from rarity and combinatorial explosion when enumerating variant combinations, limiting our ability to study oligogenic basis for these disorders. We present a framework that combines the apriori algorithm and statistical inference to identify specific combinations of mutated genes associated with complex phenotypes. Our approach overcomes computational barriers and exhaustively evaluates variant combinations to identify non-additive relationships between simultaneously mutated genes. Using this approach, we analyzed 6,189 individuals with autism and identified 718 combinations significantly associated with ID, and carriers of these combinations showed lower IQ than expected in an independent cohort of 1,878 individuals. These combinations were enriched for nervous system genes such as NIN and NGF, showed complex inheritance patterns, and were depleted in unaffected siblings. We found that an affected individual can carry many oligogenic combinations, each contributing to the same phenotype or distinct phenotypes at varying effect sizes. We also used this framework to identify combinations associated with multiple comorbid phenotypes, including mutations of COL28A1 and MFSD2B for ID and schizophrenia and ABCA4, DNAH10 and MC1R for ID and anxiety/depression. Our framework identifies a key component of missing heritability and provides a novel paradigm to untangle the genetic architecture of complex disorders.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEWhile rare mutations in single genes or their collective burden partially explain the genetic basis for complex disorders, the role of specific combinations of rare variants is not completely understood. This is because combinations of rare variants are rarer and evaluating all possible combinations would result in a combinatorial explosion, creating difficulties for statistical and computational analysis. We developed a data mining approach that overcomes these limitations to precisely quantify the influence of combinations of two or more mutated genes on a specific clinical feature or multiple co-occurring features. Our framework provides a new paradigm for dissecting the genetic causes of complex disorders and provides an impetus for its utility in clinical diagnosis.",

Single cell data can capture more fine-grained details on transcriptional variability and dynamics to gain a better understanding of the molecular underpinnings of inter-individual variation in drug response. Here, we used single cell RNA-seq to study the dynamics of the transcriptional response to glucocorticoids in activated Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells from 96 African American children. We employed novel statistical approaches to calculate a mean-independent measure of gene expression variability and a measure of transcriptional response pseudotime. Using these approaches, we demonstrated that glucocorticoids reverse the effects of immune stimulation on both gene expression mean and variability. Our novel measure of gene expression response dynamics, based on the diagonal linear discriminant analysis, separated individual cells by response status on the basis of their transcriptional profiles and allowed us to identify different dynamic patterns of gene expression along the response pseudotime. We identified genetic variants regulating gene expression mean and variability, including treatment-specific effects, and demonstrated widespread genetic regulation of the transcriptional dynamics of the gene expression response.",

    "abstract": "Ants are ubiquitous and consume insects at all life stages, presumably creating a strong selective pressure for ant avoidance behaviors across insects. The insect egg stage can be especially defenseless against predation given that eggs are usually immobile and unguarded, suggesting insect mothers may have evolved oviposition strategies to minimize the ant predation risk to their offspring. Given the lack of parental care in most insects, these oviposition strategies would likely be innate rather than learned, since insect mothers are not usually present to assess predation of their eggs. Here, we use the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model system for examining parental defensive responses to ant presence. Flies usually lay eggs partially inserted into the food substrate, although some are laid on top of the food and a few are inserted deeply into the food. We found that exposure to ants significantly alters fly oviposition depth: the proportion of eggs on the food surface decreased while the proportion of buried eggs increased. Buried eggs survive ant foraging bouts better than surface eggs, showing that this oviposition depth behavior is adaptive. This induced behavior is conserved across the genus Drosophila and is dependent on the fly olfactory system: anosmic mutant flies fail to bury their eggs in the presence of ants, and ant odor extracts are sufficient to induce egg burying. To further delineate the ant lineages to which flies respond, we exposed flies to the odors from numerous species of ants and other insects. Surprisingly, flies buried their eggs in response to the odors of nearly all hymenopterans tested, including hymenopteran groups that flies rarely interact with in nature like bees and paper wasps. Our data suggest that hymenopterans possess a conserved and ancient odorant, and that drosophilids evolved a mechanism for sensing this odorant early in their evolution as a means of protecting their offspring from ant predation. This study sheds light on the ecology and mechanisms underlying a sscommon biotic interaction in nature, that between insect parents ands the ants that would consume their offspring.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveMetformin exhibits therapeutic potential in behavioural deficits induced by methamphetamine (METH) in rats. Emerging studies suggest gut microbiota may impact psychiatric symptoms, but there is no direct evidence supporting metformins participation in the pathophysiology of withdrawal symptoms via modulation of gut microbiota.\n\nMehodsIn order to define the functional contributions by gut microbiota and metformin to the behavioural deficits during METH withdrawal, we utilized a combination of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), high-throughput sequencing, and untargeted metabolomics technologies.\n\nResultsFirst, METH addicts exhibited higher  diversity and distinct microbial structures compared to heathy controls. In particular, the relative abundance of Rikenellaceae was positively correlated with the severity of anxiety and depression. Second, both human-to-mouse and mouse-to-mouse FMTs confirmed that METH-altered-microbiota transplantation is sufficient to promote anxiety and depression-like behaviours in recipient germ-free mice, and these behavioural disturbances could be ameliorated by metformin. In-depth analysis revealed that METH significantly altered the bacterial composition and structure as well as relative abundance of several bacterial taxa and metabolites, including Rikenellaceae and inosine, respectively, whereas add-on metformin could remodel these alterations. Finally, the inosine complementation successfully restored METH-induced anxiety and depression-like behaviours in mice.\n\nDiscussionThis study demonstrates that METH withdrawal-induced anxiety and depression-like behaviours are convertible and transmissible via gut microbiota in a mouse model.

    "abstract": "In patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), dysregulation of RNA-binding proteins like MBNL and CELF1 leads to alternative splicing of exons and is thought to induce a return to fetal splicing patterns in adult tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). To comprehensively evaluate this, we created an atlas of developmentally regulated splicing patterns in the frontal cortex of healthy individuals and DM1 patients by combining RNA-seq data from BrainSpan, GTEx and DM1 patients. Thirty four splice events displayed an inclusion pattern in DM1 patients that is typical for the fetal situation in healthy individuals. The regulation of DM1-relevant splicing patterns could partly be explained by changes in mRNA expression of the splice regulators MBNL1, MBNL2 and CELF1. On the contrary, interindividual differences in splicing patterns between healthy adults could not be explained by differential expression of these splice regulators. Our findings lend transcriptome-wide evidence to the previously noted shift to fetal splicing patterns in the adult DM1 brain as a consequence of an imbalance in antagonistic MBNL and CELF1 activities. Our atlas serves as a solid foundation for further study and understanding of the cognitive phenotype in patients.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variations affect behavior and cause disease but understanding how these variants drive complex traits is still an open question. A common approach is to link the genetic variants to intermediate molecular phenotypes such as the transcriptome using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Paradoxically, these variants between the samples are usually ignored at the beginning of RNA-seq analyses of many model organisms. This can skew the transcriptome estimates that are used later for downstream analyses, such as expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) detection. Here, we assessed the impact of reference-based analysis on the transcriptome and eQTLs in a widely-used mouse genetic population: the BXD panel of recombinant inbred lines. We highlight existing reference bias in the transcriptome data analysis and propose practical solutions which combine available genetic variants, genotypes, and genome reference sequence. The use of custom BXD line references improved downstream analysis compared to classical genome reference. These insights would likely benefit genetic studies with a transcriptomic component and demonstrate that genome references might need to be reassessed and improved.",

    "abstract": "Space is an extremely hostile environment. Traveling to space has numerous effects on the body of the astronauts at a molecular level. As space agencies prepare for long-term missions, it becomes important to investigate these problems and address them. Thus, in the current study, we assessed the impact of simulated microgravity on the basic pathways especially DNA damage response. We identified a total of 7542 significantly differentially expressed genes. Out of these genes, 4504 were found to be up-regulated while 3038 were down-regulated in the simulated microgravity group in comparison to controls. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that simulated microgravity has an effect on vital basic biological processes like DNA damage repair, peptide transport, and metabolism. To explore if the same pathways were also altered in humans, we explored the NASA twin study data and found that DDR was also significantly affected in the astronaut but due to ionizing radiation. Upon further investigation, we found that 62 genes belonging to the DDR pathway were mutually differentially expressed in Scott Kelly and the zebrafish embryos. However, there were 29 significantly differentially expressed genes belonging to the DDR pathway in zebrafish embryos that were not found to be differentially expressed in Scott Kelly. Out of these 29 genes, 14 were specific to zebrafish. Upon further investigation, we found that the DDR pathway is affected differently in simulated microgravity as compared to ionizing radiation. These observations provide a preliminary look into the difference in DDR induced by the different factors of spaceflight.",

    "abstract": "The TP63 gene encodes the transcription factor p63. It is frequently amplified or overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas. Owing to alternative splicing, p63 has multiple isoforms called , {beta}, {gamma} and {delta}. The regulatory functions of p63 may be isoform-specific. The  isoform inhibits the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and controls apoptosis, while the {gamma} isoform promotes EMT. Here, we observed in TCGA data that a high ratio of the TP63{gamma} isoform to the other isoforms is a pejorative factor for the survival of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We therefore addressed the regulation of the {gamma} isoform. In several tissues (GTEX data), the expression of the RNA-binding protein PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) is negatively correlated with the abundance of TP63{gamma}. Accordingly, we demonstrated that PTBP1 depletion in HNSCC cell lines leads to an increase in abundance of the {gamma} isoform. By RNA immunoprecipitation and in vitro interaction assays, we showed that PTBP1 directly binds to TP63 pre-mRNA in close proximity to the TP63{gamma}-specific exon. The region around the TP63{gamma}-specific exon was sufficient to elicit a PTBP1-dependent regulation of alternative splicing in a splice reporter minigene assay. Finally, we demonstrated that the regulation of TP63{gamma} production by PTBP1 is conserved in amphibians, revealing that it encounters a strong evolutionary pressure. Together, these results identify TP63{gamma} as a prognostic marker in HNSCC, and identify PTBP1 as a direct negative regulator of its production.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs are heterogeneous group of transcripts that lack coding potential and have crucial roles in gene regulations. Recent days have seen an increasing association of non-coding RNAs with human diseases, especially cancers. Satellite III (SatIII) lncRNAs are transcribed from pericentromeric heterochromatic region of the human chromosome. Though transcriptionally silent in normal conditions, SatIII is actively transcribed under condition of stress, mainly heat shock. SatII repeat, another component of pericentromeric region of human chromosome, has been associated with wide variety of epithelial cancer. Overexpression of Satellite RNAs induces breast cancer in mice. Though much is known about Satellite RNAs, which includes alpha satellites and SatII repeats, however little is known about SatIII in human cancers. Hence we directed our study to understand the role of human Satellite III repeats in cancerous conditions. In the present study, we show that colon and breast cancer cells transcribe SatIII independent of heat shock, in an HSF1-independent manner. Our study also reveals that, overexpression of SatIII RNA favours cancer cell survival by overriding chemo drug-induced cell death. Knockdown of SatIII sensitizes cells towards chemotherapeutic drugs. SatIII transcript knockdown restores the expression of p53 protein, which in turn facilitates cell death. Heat shock however helps SatIII to continue with its pro-cell survival function. Our results, therefore suggest SatIII to be an important regulator of human cancers. Induction of SatIII is not only a response to the oncogenic stress but also facilitates cancer progression by a distinct pathway that is different from heat stress pathway.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine regulates normal functions such as movement, reinforcement learning, and cognition, and its dysfunction has been implicated in multiple psychiatric and neurological disorders. Dopamine acts through the D1- (D1R and D5R) and D2-class (D2R, D3R and D4R) of seven transmembrane receptors, and activates both G-protein- and {beta}-arrestin-dependent signaling pathways, to mediate its physiological effects. Current dopamine receptor-based therapies are used to ameliorate motor deficits in Parkinsons disease, or as antipsychotic medications for schizophrenia. These drugs show efficacy for ameliorating only some symptoms caused by dopamine dysfunction and are plagued by debilitating side-effects. Studies in primates and rodents have shown that shifting the balance of dopamine receptor signaling towards the arrestin pathway can be beneficial for inducing normal movement, while reducing motor side-effects such as dyskinesias, and can be efficacious at enhancing cognitive function compared to balanced agonists. Several structure-activity-relationship (SAR) studies have embarked on discovering {beta}-arrestin-biased dopamine agonists, focused on D2 partial agonists, non-catechol D1 agonists, and mixed D1/D2R dopamine receptor agonists. Here, we describe an SAR study to identify novel D1R {beta}-arrestin biased ligands using A-86929, a high-affinity D1R catechol agonist, as a core scaffold. Previously described and novel analogs of A-86929 were synthesized and screened in vitro for structure-functional-selectivity relationships (SFSR) studies to identify chemical motifs responsible for {beta}-arrestin biased activity at both D1 and D2Rs. Most of the A-86929 analogs screened were G protein biased but none of them were exclusively arrestin-biased. Additionally, various catechol aryl fragments were designed and synthesized. Other compounds surveyed included hydroxyl and chloro analogs of dopamine to test for hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions. Some of these small molecular probes displayed weak bias towards the {beta}-arrestin pathway.

    "abstract": "Multi-spectral (MS) imaging enables the measurement of characteristics important for increasing the prediction accuracy of genotypic and phenotypic values for yield-related traits. In this study, we evaluated the potential application of temporal MS imaging for the prediction of above-ground biomass (AGB) and determined which developmental stages should be used for accurate prediction in soybean. Field experiments with 198 accessions of soybean were conducted with four different irrigation levels. Five vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated using MS images from soybean canopies from early to late growth stages. To predict the genotypic values of AGB, VIs at the different growth stages were used as secondary traits in a multi-trait genomic prediction. The accuracy of the prediction model increased starting at an early stage of growth (31 days after sowing). To predict phenotypic values of AGB, we employed multi-kernel genomic prediction. Consequently, the prediction accuracy of phenotypic values reached a maximum at a relatively early growth stage (38 days after sowing). Hence, the optimal timing for MS imaging may depend on the irrigation levels.",

    "abstract": "It has become increasingly clear that the microbiome plays a critical role in shaping the host organisms response to disease. There also exists mounting evidence that an organisms ploidy level is important in their response to pathogens and parasites. However, no study has determined if or how these two factors influence one another. We investigate the effect of whole-genome duplication in Arabidopsis thaliana on their above-ground (phyllosphere) microbiome, and determine the interacting impacts of ploidy and the microbiome on disease outcome. Using seven independently derived synthetic auto-tetraploid Arabidopsis accessions, a synthetic leaf-associated bacterial community, and the model pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. Tomato DC3000, we confirm that polyploids are generally more resistant to pathogens, but illustrate that this resistance may be in part due to a decrease in the reliance on beneficial bacteria. Polyploids fare better against the pathogen than diploids regardless of microbial inoculation, while we observed that diploids harboring an intact microbiome have lower pathogen densities than those without. We then use RNA sequencing to show that diploids have many more differentially expressed defense-related genes in the presence of their phyllosphere microbiota, while polyploids exhibit constitutively activated defenses regardless of exposure to the synthetic community. These results imply that whole-genome duplication can disrupt historical host-microbiome associations, and suggest that a potential cause or consequence of disruption is a heightened capacity for pathogen defense that is less impacted by the microbiome.",

    "abstract": "The physicochemical and agronomic properties of a new form of bread wheat, lacking B-type starch granules (BlessT) were assessed. Three BlessT mutant lines, made by combining homoeologous deletions of BGC1, a gene responsible for the control of B-granule content were compared with two sibling lines with normal starch phenotype and the parent line, cv. Paragon. Quantification of starch granule size and number in developing grain confirmed the lack of small, B-type starch granules throughout development in BlessT. Most starch, flour, grain and loaf characteristics did not vary between BlessT and the wild type sibling controls. However, BlessT starches had higher water absorption, reduced grain hardness and higher protein content, and dough made from BlessT flour required more water and had increased elasticity. Despite the lack of B-granules, BlessT lines do not display a significant decrease in total starch content suggesting that it should be possible to produce commercial wheat varieties that lack B-type starch granules without compromising yield. These findings support the potential utility of this novel type of wheat as a specialist crop in applications ranging from bread making and alcohol production to improved industrial starch products.",

    "abstract": "Two major COVID-19 pandemic challenges presented for in-person instruction included adhering to social distancing guidelines and accommodating remote learners who were temporarily isolated or permanently participating from afar. At Binghamton University, our First-year Research Immersion (FRI) program was challenged with providing students with a wet lab course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE), an intense hands-on experience that emphasized student teamwork, lab protocol development, iteration, troubleshooting and other elements of the process of science that could not be replicated in a fully remote environment. We developed an innovative technology approach to maximize all students connection to the lab research experience utilizing dedicated mobile devices (iPod Touch) and video conferencing software (Zoom) to synchronously connect remote learners to in-person learners, peer mentors and instructors in our FRI research labs. In this way, despite limited lab capacities and fluctuating remote learning populations, we were able to connect remote learners to their peers and mentors in real-time and give them responsibilities that allowed them to be engaged and feel like meaningful participants in the research process. Although our students reported a preference for in-person labs, they noted this hybrid model was better than other traditionally employed remote-learning lab options. We believe lessons learned here can be applied to improve access to research in all situations and allow us to be prepared for other catastrophic disruptions to the educational system.",
