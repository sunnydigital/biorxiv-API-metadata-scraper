    "abstract": "We report in this study the molecular engineering of nanobodies that bind with picomolar affinity to both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domains (RBD) and are highly neutralizing. We applied Deep Mutational Engineering to VHH72, a nanobody initially specific for SARS-CoV-1 RBD with little cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigen. We first identified all the individual VHH substitutions that increase binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and then screened highly focused combinatorial libraries to isolate engineered nanobodies with improved properties. The corresponding VHH-Fc molecules show high affinities for SARS-CoV-2 antigens from various emerging variants and SARS-CoV-1, block the interaction between ACE2 and RBD and neutralize the virus with high efficiency. Its rare specificity across sarbecovirus relies on its peculiar epitope outside the immunodominant regions. The engineered nanobodies share a common motif of three amino acids, which contribute to the broad specificity of recognition. These nanobodies appears as promising therapeutic candidates to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "With the continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2, variants of concern (VOCs) and their mutations are a focus of rapid assessment. Vital mutations in the VOC are found in spike protein, particularly in the receptor binding domain (RBD), which directly interacts with ACE2 on the host cell membrane, a key determinant of the binding affinity and cell entry. With the reporting of the most recent VOC, omicron, we performed amino acid sequence alignment of the omicron spike protein with that of the wild type and other VOCs. Although it shares several conserved mutations with other variants, we found that omicron has a large number of unique mutations. We applied the Hopp-Woods scale to calculate the hydrophilicity scores of the amino acid stretches of the RBD and the entire spike protein, and found 3 new hydrophilic regions in the RBD of omicron, implying exposure to water, with the potential to bind proteins such as ACE2 increasing transmissibility and infectivity. However, careful analysis reveals that most of the exposed domains of spike protein can serve as antigenic epitopes for generating B cell and T cell-mediated immune responses. This suggests that in the collection of polyclonal antibodies to various epitopes generated after multiple doses of vaccination, some can likely still bind to the omicron spike protein and the RBD to prevent severe clinical disease. In summary, while the omicron variant might result in more infectivity, it can still bind to a reasonable repertoire of antibodies generated by multiple doses of current vaccines likely preventing severe disease. Effective vaccines may not universally prevent opportunistic infections but can prevent the sequelae of severe disease, as observed for the delta variant. This might still be the case with the omicron variant, albeit, with increased frequency of infection.",

    "abstract": "The cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as an attractive drug development target. We previously reported that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and the cortex actin, which can be targeted by therapeutic agents identified by conventional drug repurposing screens. However, this drug identification strategy requires laborious library screening, which is time-consuming and often limited number of compounds can be screened. As an alternative approach, we developed and trained a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based classification model using information extracted from experimentally identified HSPG and actin inhibitors. This method allowed us to virtually screen 170,000 compounds, resulting in [~]2000 potential hits. A hit confirmation assay with the uptake of a fluorescently labeled HSPG cargo further shortlisted 256 active compounds. Among them, 16 compounds had modest to strong inhibitory activities against the entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particles into Vero E6 cells. These results establish a GCN-based virtual screen workflow for rapid identification of new small molecule inhibitors against validated drug targets.\n\nGraphical TOC Entry\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/471787v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (16K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1632bc4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ce912borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9cdc86org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@521712_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Given the continuing heavy toll of the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of the Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants, the WHO declared both as variants of concern (VOC). There are valid concerns that the latest Omicron variant might have increased infectivity and pathogenicity. In addition, the sheer number of S protein mutations in the Omicron variant raise concerns of potential immune evasion and resistance to therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies. However, structural insights that underpin the potential increased pathogenicity are unknown. Here we adopted an artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach to predict the structural changes induced by mutations of the Delta and Omicron variants in the spike (S) protein using Alphafold. This was followed by docking the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with the predicted S proteins for Wuhan-Hu-1, Delta, and Omicron variants. Our in-silico structural analysis indicates that S protein for Omicron variant has a higher binding affinity to ACE-2 receptor, compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 and Delta variants. In addition, the recognition sites of the receptor binding domains for Delta and Omicron variants showed lower electronegativity compared to Wuhan-Hu-1. Importantly, further molecular insights revealed significant changes induced at fusion protein (FP) site, which may mediate enhanced viral entry. These results represent the first computational analysis of structural changes associated with Omicron variant using Alphafold, Collectively, our results highlight potential structural basis for enhanced pathogenicity of the Omicron variant, however further validation using X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM are warranted.",

    "abstract": "The Mygalomorph spiders of the family Atypidae are among the most archaic spiders. The genus Atypus Latreille, 1804 occurs in Eurasia and northern Africa, with a single enigmatic species, Atypus snetsingeri Sarno, 1973, restricted to a small area in southeastern Pennsylvania in Eastern USA. This study was undertaken to learn more about genetics of that species, its habitat requirements and natural history. A close relationship to European species could be assumed based on A. snetsingeris occurrence on the eastern coast of the USA, however molecular markers (CO1 sequences) confirmed that A. snetsingeri is identical with Atypus karschi Donitz, 1887 native to East Asia; it is an introduced species. The specific epithet snetsingeri is therefore relegated to a junior synonym of A. karschi. The karyotype of A. karschi has 42 chromosomes in females and 41 in males (X0 sex chromosome system). Chromosomes were metacentric except for one pair, which exhibited submetacentric morphology. In Pennsylvania the above-ground webs are usually vertical and attached to the base of bushes, trees, or walls, although some webs are oriented horizontally near the ground. It was found in a variety of habitats from forests to suburban shrubbery, and over a wide range of soil humidity and physical parameters. Prey include millipedes, snails, woodlice, carabid beetles and earthworms. The number of juveniles in excavated female webs ranged from 70 to 201. Atypus karschi is the first known case of an introduced purse-web spider. It is rarely noticed but well-established within its range in southeastern Pennsylvania.",

Although these latter infections are associated with milder COVID-19 disease relative to unvaccinated subjects, the specificity and durability of antibody responses elicited by Delta breakthrough cases remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that breakthrough infections induce serum binding and neutralizing antibody responses that are markedly more potent, durable and resilient to spike mutations observed in variants of concern than those observed in subjects who were infected only or received only two doses of COVID-19 vaccine. However, wee show that Delta breakthrough cases, subjects who were vaccinated after SARS-CoV-2 infection and individuals vaccinated three times (without infection) have serum neutralizing activity of comparable magnitude and breadth indicate that multiple types of exposure or increased number of exposures to SARS-CoV-2 antigen(s) enhance spike-specific antibody responses. Neutralization of the genetically divergent SARS-CoV, however, was moderate with all four cohorts examined, except after four exposures to the SARS-CoV-2 spike, underscoring the importance of developing vaccines eliciting broad sarbecovirus immunity for pandemic preparedness.",

    "abstract": "Copper is a critical element for eukaryotic life, involved in numerous cellular functions and in redox balance but it can be toxic in excess. Therefore, tight regulation of copper acquisition and homeostasis is essential for cell physiology and survival. Here, we identified a unique mechanism for cell survival involving the regulation of copper homeostasis by an endogenous retroviral (ERV) envelope glycoprotein called Refrex1. We show that extracellular copper sensing by cells increases Refrex1 expression, which in turn regulates copper acquisition through interaction with the main copper transporter SLC31A1/CTR1. Downmodulation of Refrex1 resulted in intracellular copper accumulation leading to ROS production and subsequent apoptosis, which could be reverted by copper chelator treatment. Our results demonstrate that Refrex1 has been co-opted for its ability to regulate copper entry through CTR1 interaction in order to limit copper excess for a proper redox balance, and suggests that other ERV may have similar metabolic functions among vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages are vastly abundant, diverse, and influential, but with few exceptions (e.g. the Proteobacteria genera Wolbachia and Hamiltonella), the role of phages in heritable bacteria-arthropod interactions, which are ubiquitous and diverse, remains largely unexplored. Despite prior studies documenting phage-like particles in the mollicute Spiroplasma associated with Drosophila flies, genomic sequences of such phage are lacking, and their effects on the Spiroplasma-Drosophila interaction have not been comprehensively characterized. We used a density step gradient to isolate phage-like particles from the male-killing bacterium Spiroplasma poulsonii (strains NSRO and MSRO-Br) harbored by Drosophila melanogaster. Isolated particles were subjected to DNA sequencing, assembly, and annotation. Several lines of evidence suggest that we recovered phage-like particles of similar features (shape, size, DNA content) to those previously reported in Drosophila-associated Spiroplasma strains. We recovered three [~]19 kb phage-like contigs (two in NSRO and one in MSRO-Br) containing 21-24 open reading frames, a read-alignment pattern consistent with circular permutation, and terminal redundancy (at least in NSRO). Although our results do not allow us to distinguish whether these phage-like contigs represent infective phage-like particles capable of transmitting their DNA to new hosts, their encoding of several typical phage genes suggests that they are at least remnants of functional phage. We also recovered two smaller non-phage-like contigs encoding a known Spiroplasma toxin (Ribosome Inactivating Protein; RIP), and an insertion element, suggesting that they are packaged into particles. Substantial homology of our particle-derived contigs was found in the genome assemblies of members of the Spiroplasma poulsonii clade.",

Using pooled mutant fitness assays, we identified genes and proteins involved in the assimilation of 52 different nitrogen containing compounds. To assay amino acid biosynthesis, 19 amino acid drop- out conditions were also tested. From these 71 conditions, significant fitness phenotypes were elicited in 672 different genes including 100 transcriptional regulators and 112 transport-related proteins. We divide these conditions into 6 classes, and propose assimilatory pathways for the compounds based on this wealth of genetic data. To complement these data, we characterize the substrate range of three promiscuous aminotransferases relevant to metabolic engineering efforts in vitro. Furthermore, we examine the specificity of five transcriptional regulators, explaining some fitness data results and exploring their potential to be developed into useful synthetic biology tools. In addition, we use manifold learning to create an interactive visualization tool for interpreting our BarSeq data, which will improve the accessibility and utility of this work to other researchers.\n\nIMPORTANCEUnderstanding the genetic basis of P. putidas diverse metabolism is imperative for us to reach its full potential as a host for metabolic engineering.

    "abstract": "During meiotic prophase, cohesin-dependent axial structures are formed in the synaptonemal complex (SC). However, the functional correlation between these structures and cohesion remains elusive. Here, we examined the formation of cohesin-dependent axial structures in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This organism forms atypical SCs composed of linear elements (LinEs) resembling the lateral elements of SC but lacking the transverse filaments. Hi-C analysis using a highly synchronous population of meiotic S. pombe cells revealed that the axis-loop chromatin structure formed in meiotic prophase was dependent on the Rec8 cohesin complex. In contrast, the Rec8-mediated formation of the axis-loop structure occurred in cells lacking components of LinEs. To dissect the functions of Rec8, we identified a rec8-F204S mutant that lost the ability to assemble the axis-loop structure without losing cohesion of sister chromatids. This mutant showed defects in the formation of the axis-loop structure and LinE assembly and thus exhibited reduced meiotic recombination. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the Rec8-dependent axis-loop structure provides a structural platform essential for LinE assembly, facilitating meiotic recombination of homologous chromosomes, independently of its role in sister chromatid cohesion.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe efficacy of zinc phosphide (ZnP) for broadacre control of wild house mice in Australia is being reported by growers as increasingly variable. Have mice become less sensitive over time or are they taking a sub-lethal dose and developing aversion? In this laboratory study the sensitivity of groups of wild caught and an outbred laboratory strain of mice was assessed using oral gavage of a range of ZnP concentrations. The willingness of mice to consume ZnP-coated grains was then determined.\n\nRESULTSEach mouse group had very similar LD50 values (72 to 79 mg ZnP per kg body weight) which are significantly higher than previously reported. Time to death post-gavage ranged between 2.5 to 48 h. ZnP coated grains (50 g ZnP per kg grain) presented in the absence of alternative food were consumed and 94 percent of wild mice died. Mice provided with alternative food and ZnP coated wheat grains (either 25 or 50 g ZnP per kg grain) consumed toxic and non-toxic grains, and mortality was lower (33 to 55 percent). If a sublethal amount of ZnP coated grain was consumed, aversion occurred mostly in the presence of alternative food.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThe sensitivity of wild house mice to ZnP in Australia is significantly lower than previously assumed. Under laboratory conditions ZnP coated grains coated with a new higher dose (50 g ZnP per kg grain) were readily consumed. Consumption of toxic grain occurred when alternative food was available but was decreased. It is important to assess the efficacy of the higher ZnP dose per grain under natural field conditions, especially when background food is low.",

    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable and aggressive plasma cell malignancy characterized by a complex karyotype with multiple structural variants (SVs) and copy number variations (CNVs). Linked-read whole-genome sequencing (lrWGS) allows for refined detection and reconstruction of SVs by providing long-range genetic information from standard short-read sequencing. This makes lrWGS an attractive solution for capturing the full genomic complexity of MM. Here we show that high-quality lrWGS data can be generated from low numbers of FACS sorted cells without DNA purification. Using this protocol, we analyzed FACS sorted MM cells from 37 MM patients with lrWGS. We found high concordance between lrWGS and FISH for the detection of recurrent translocations and CNVs. Outside of the regions investigated by FISH, we identified >150 additional SVs and CNVs across the cohort. Analysis of the lrWGS data allowed for resolving the structure of diverse SVs affecting the MYC and t(11;14) loci causing the duplication of genes and gene regulatory elements. In addition, we identified private SVs causing the dysregulation of genes recurrently involved in translocations with the IGH locus and show that these can alter the molecular classification of the MM. Overall, we conclude that lrWGS allows for the detection of aberrations critical for MM prognostics and provides a feasible route for providing comprehensive genetics. Implementing lrWGS could provide more accurate clinical prognostics, facilitate genomic medicine initiatives, and greatly improve the stratification of patients included in clinical trials.\n\nKEY POINTS- Linked-read WGS can be performed without DNA purification and allows for resolving the diverse structural variants found in multiple myeloma.\n- Linked-read WGS can, as a stand-alone assay, provide comprehensive genetics in myeloma and other diseases with complex genomes.",

    "abstract": "Stripe rust disease of wheat, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, (Pst) is one of the most serious diseases of wheat worldwide. In India, virulent stripe rust races have been constantly evolving in the North-Western Plains Zone leading to the failure of some of the most widely grown resistant varieties in the region. With the goal of studying the recent evolution of virulent races in this region, we conducted whole-genome sequencing of three prevalent Indian Pst pathotypes Pst46S119, Pst78S84 and Pst110S119. We assembled 58.62, 58.33 and 55.78 Mb of Pst110S119, Pst46S119 and Pst78S84 genome, respectively. Pathotypes were found to be highly heterozygous. Comparative phylogenetic analysis indicated the recent evolution of pathotypes Pst110S119 and Pst78S84 from Pst46S119. Pathogenicity-related genes classes (CAZyme, proteases, effectors, and secretome proteins) were identified and found to be under positive selection. Higher rate of gene family expansion was also observed in the three pathotypes. A strong association between the effector genes and transposable elements may be the source of the rapid evolution of these strains. Phylogenetic analysis differentiated the Indian races in this study from other known US, European, African and Asian races. Diagnostic markers developed for the identification of different Pst pathotypes will help tracking of yellow rust at farmers field and strategizing resistance gene deployment.",

On its spike glycoprotein alone, more than 30 substitutions have been characterized with 15 within the receptor binding domain (RBD); It therefore calls to question the transmissibility and antibody escapability of Omicron. This study was setup to investigate the Omicron RBDs interaction with ACE2 (host receptor) and a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb).\n\nMethodsIn-silico mutagenesis was used to generate the Om-RBD in complex with ACE2 or mAb from the wildtype. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories were analyzed for interaction.\n\nResultsMD trajectories showed that Omicron RBD has evolved into an efficient ACE2 binder, via pi-pi (Om-RBD-Y501/ACE2-Y41) and salt-bridge (Om-RBD-K493/ACE2-Y41) interactions. Conversely, in binding mAb, it has become less efficient (Center of mass distance of RBD from mAb complex, wildtype {approx} 30 [A], Omicron {approx} 41 [A]). Disruption of Om-RBD/mAb complex resulted from loose interaction between Om-RBD and the light chain complementarity-determining region residues.\n\nConclusionsOmicron is expected to be better transmissible and less efficiently interacting with neutralizing convalescent mAbs.\n\nGeneral significanceOur results elucidate the mechanisms for higher transmissibility in Omicron variant.",

    "abstract": "The structural and functional studies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants revealed an important role of the D614G mutation that is shared across many variants of concern(VOCs), suggesting the effect of this mutation on the enhanced virus infectivity and transmissibility. The recent structural and biophysical studies provided important evidence about multiple conformational substates of the D614G spike protein. The development of a plausible mechanistic model which can explain the experimental observations from a more unified thermodynamic perspective is an important objective of the current work. In this study, we employed efficient and accurate coarse-grained simulations of multiple structural substates of the D614G spike trimers together with the ensemble-based mutational frustration analysis to characterize the dynamics signatures of the conformational landscapes. By combining the local frustration profiling of the conformational states with residue-based mutational scanning of protein stability and network analysis of allosteric interactions and communications, we determine the patterns of mutational sensitivity in the functional regions and sites of variants. We found that the D614G mutation may induce a considerable conformational adaptability of the open states in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein without compromising folding stability and integrity of the spike protein. The results suggest that the D614G mutant may employ a hinge-shift mechanism in which the dynamic couplings between the site of mutation and the inter-protomer hinge modulate the inter-domain interactions, global mobility change and the increased stability of the open form. This study proposes that mutation-induced modulation of the conformational flexibility and energetic frustration at the inter-protomer interfaces may serve as an efficient mechanism for allosteric regulation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.",

Here, we investigated the role of nuclear NAD+, an essential cofactor for the activity of key DNA repair proteins, including PARP1 and sirtuins. We show that NMNAT1-the enzyme synthesizing nuclear NAD+ - is synthetically lethal with BRCA1/2 in a PARP1-independent but SIRT6-dependent manner. Consequently, inhibition of NMNAT1/SIRT6 axis not only kills naive but also PARPi-resistant HRD cancer cells.

Here, we describe the development of a streamlined platform for in vivo gene activation using CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) technology. Unlike conventional GEMMs, our model system allows for flexible, sustained and timed activation of one or more target genes using single or pooled lentiviral guides. Using Myc and Yap1 as model oncogenes, we demonstrate gene activation in primary pancreatic organoid cultures in vitro and enhanced tumorigenic potential in Myc-activated organoids when transplanted orthotopically. By implementing our model as an autochthonous lung cancer model, we show that transduction-mediated Myc activation leads to accelerated tumor progression and significantly reduced overall survival relative to non-targeted tumor controls. Furthermore, we found that Myc-activation led to the acquisition of an immune suppressive \"cold\" tumor microenvironment. Through cross-species validation of our results using publicly available RNA/DNA-seq data sets, we were able to link MYC to a previously described, immunosuppressive transcriptomic subtype in patient tumors, thus identifying a patient cohort that may benefit from combined MYC/immune-targeted therapies. Overall, our work demonstrates how CRISPRa can be used for rapid functional validation of putative oncogenes and may allow for the identification and evaluation of potential metastatic and oncogenic drivers through competitive screening.",

    "abstract": "Clinical disease from Clostridioides difficile infection can be mediated by two toxins and their neighboring regulatory genes encoded within the five-gene pathogenicity locus (PaLoc). We provide several lines of evidence that the toxin activity of C. difficile may be modulated by genomic variants outside of the PaLoc. We used a phylogenetic tree-based approach to demonstrate discordance between toxin activity and PaLoc evolutionary history, an elastic net method to show the insufficiency of PaLoc variants alone to model toxin activity, and a convergence-based bacterial genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify correlations between non-PaLoc loci with changes in toxin activity. Combined, these data support a model of C. difficile disease wherein toxin activity may be strongly affected by many non-PaLoc loci. Additionally, we characterize multiple other in vitro phenotypes relevant to human infections including germination and sporulation. These phenotypes vary greatly in their clonality, variability, convergence, and concordance with genomic variation. Lastly, we highlight the intersection of loci identified by GWAS for different phenotypes and clinical severity. This strategy to identify the overlapping loci can facilitate the identification of genetic variation linking phenotypic variation to clinical outcomes.\n\nIMPORTANCEClostridioides difficile has two major disease mediating toxins, A and B, encoded within the pathogenicity locus (PaLoc). In this study we demonstrate via multiple approaches that genomic variants outside of the PaLoc are associated with changes in toxin activity. These genomic variants may provide new avenues of exploration in the hunt for novel disease modifying interventions. Additionally, we provide insight into the evolution of several additional phenotypes also critical to clinical infection such as sporulation, germination, and growth rate. These in vitro phenotypes display a range of responses to evolutionary pressures and as such vary in their appropriateness for certain bacterial genome wide association study approaches. We used a convergence-based association method to identify the genomic variants most correlated with both changes in these phenotypes and disease severity.

    "abstract": "DNA cytosine methylation and its oxidized products are important epigenetic modifications in mammalian cells. Although 5-methylcytosine (5mC) was detected in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the presence of oxidized 5mC forms remain to be characterized. Here we establish a protocol to optimize nuclease-based DNA digestion for the extremely AT-rich genome of P. falciparum (>80% A+T) for quantitative LC-MS/MS analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). We demonstrate the presence of 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC cytosine modifications in a DNMT2-only organism and observe striking ratio changes between 5mC and 5hmC during the 48-hour blood stage parasite development. Parasite-infected red blood cells cultured in different physiological oxygen concentrations revealed a shift in the cytosine modifications distribution towards the oxidized 5hmC and 5caC forms. In the absence of the canonical C5-DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1 and DNMT3A/B) in P. falciparum, we show that all cytosine modifications depend on the presence of DNMT2. We conclude that DNMT2 and oxygen levels are critical determinants that shape the dynamic cytosine epigenetic landscape in this human pathogen.",

    "abstract": "AimsThe gut microbiota is referred to an  extra organ and is ciritical in assisting the host in terms of nutrition and immunity. Environmental stressors could alter gut microbial community and cause gut inflammation. This study aimed to investigate and compare the gut microbiota community between healthy and diseased Tor tambroides.\n\nMethodology and resultsIn this study, such gut microbial alterations were explored using NGS-based 16S rDNA sequencing on the Malaysian mahseer (T. tambroides). Three adult healthy and three diseased adult Malaysian mahseers (showing signs of exophthalmia, coelomic distension and petechial haemorrhage) were obtained from LTT Aquaculture Sdn Bhd. Our results revealed significant differences in microbial diversity, composition and function between both populations of T. tambroides. Alpha diversity analysis depicts lower diversity of gut microbiota composition in diseased T. tambroides as compared to the healthy group. In particular, Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas, Bacteroides, Vibrio and Pseudomonas were found within gut microbiota of the diseased fishes. In addition, cellulose-degrading bacteria and protease-producing bacteria were identified from the gut of T. tambroides.\n\nConclusion significance and impact of studyThus, our findings emphasised on the association between the alteration in gut microbiota composition and infectious abdominal dropsy (IAD) in T. tambroides. This finding is important to provide basic information for further diagnosis, prevention and treatment of intestinal diseases in fish.",

    "abstract": "The insulin receptor and insulin like growth factor-1 receptor are heterodimers consisting of two extracellular -subunits and two transmembrane {beta}-subunits. IR {beta} and IGF1R {beta} hemi-receptors can heterodimerize to form hybrids composed of one IR {beta} and one IGF1R {beta}. Widely distributed in mammalian tissues, in contrast to IR and IGF1R the physiological function of hybrids is unclear. To identify tool compounds that inhibit hybrid formation we performed a high-throughput small molecule screen based on a homology model of hybrid structure. Our studies unveil a first in class quinoline-containing heterocyclic small molecule that reduces hybrids by >50% in human umbilical vein endothelial cells with no effect on IR or IGF1R expression. Downstream of IR and IGF1R our small molecule led to reduced expression of the negative regulatory p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, an increase in phosphorylation of its downstream target Akt and enhanced insulin and shear-induced phosphorylation of Akt. We show that hybrids have a role in human endothelial cell physiology distinct from IR and IGF1R.",

    "abstract": "Accurate cellular replication balances the biogenesis and turnover of complex structures. In the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, daughter cells form within an intact mother cell, creating additional challenges to ensuring fidelity of division. The apical complex is critical to parasite infectivity and consists of apical secretory organelles and specialized cytoskeletal structures. We previously identified the kinase ERK7 as required for maturation of the apical complex in Toxoplasma. Here we define the Toxoplasma ERK7 interactome, including a putative E3 ligase, CSAR1. Genetic disruption of CSAR1 fully suppresses loss of the apical complex upon ERK7 knockdown. Furthermore, we show that CSAR1 is normally responsible for turnover of maternal cytoskeleton during cytokinesis, and that its aberrant function is driven by mislocalization from the parasite residual body to the apical complex. These data identify a protein homeostasis pathway critical for Toxoplasma replication and fitness and suggest an unappreciated role for the parasite residual body in compartmentalizing processes that threaten the fidelity of parasite development.",

    "abstract": "PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) guard germline genomes against the deleterious action of retroviruses and other mobile genetic elements. How piRNAs faithfully discriminate between self and non-self to restrict all mobile elements while sparing essential genes remains a key outstanding question in genome biology. PiRNAs use extensive base-pairing to recognize their targets and variable 3ends could change the specificity and efficacy of piRNA silencing. Here, we identify conserved rules that ensure the generation of a single major piRNA 3end in flies and mice. Our data suggest that the PIWI proteins initially define a short interval on pre-piRNAs that grants access to the ZUC-processor complex. Within this Goldilocks zone, the preference of the ZUC-processor to cut in front of a Uridine determines the ultimate processing site. We observe a mouse-specific roadblock that relocates the Goldilocks zone and generates an opportunity for consecutive trimming by PNLDC1. Our data reveal a conserved hierarchy between length and sequence preferences that controls the piRNA sequence space. The unanticipated precision of 3end formation bolsters the emerging understanding that the functional piRNA sequence space is tightly controlled to ensure effective defense.\n\nKey findingsO_LIEvery piRNA has a single major 3end\nC_LIO_LILength preference trumps sequence preference during 3end formation.\nC_LIO_LIRelocation of the Goldilocks zone generates opportunity for trimming of mouse piRNAs.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cultured cells are widely used in molecular biology despite poor understanding of how cell line genomes change in vitro over time. Previous work has shown that Drosophila cultured cells have a higher transposable element (TE) content than whole flies, but whether this increase in TE content resulted from an initial burst of transposition during cell line establishment or ongoing transposition in cell culture remains unclear. Here we sequence the genomes of 25 sub-lines of Drosophila S2 cells and show that TE insertions provide abundant markers for the phylogenetic reconstruction of diverse sub-lines in a model animal cell culture system. Analysis of DNA copy number evolution across S2 sub-lines revealed dramatically different patterns of genome organization that support the overall evolutionary history reconstructed using TE insertions. Analysis of TE insertion site occupancy and ancestral states support a model of ongoing transposition dominated by episodic activity of a small number of retrotransposon families. Our work demonstrates that substantial genome evolution occurs during long-term Drosophila cell culture, which may impact the reproducibility of experiments that do not control for sub-line identity.",

    "abstract": "Integration of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) into human genome disrupts genetic structures and cellular functions. Here, we conducted multiplatform long read sequencing on two cell lines and five clinical samples of HBV-infected hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). We resolved three types of viral integration-induced complex genome rearrangements (CGR) and proposed a model of  multi-hits and sequential-breaks to depict their formation process by differentiating inserted HBV copies with HiFi long reads. We deduced that all three complex types were initialized from focal replacement and fragile virus-human junctions triggered subsequent rearrangements. We further revealed that such rearrangements caused a prevalent loss-of-heterozygosity at chr4q, accounting for 19.5% of HCC samples in ICGC cohort and contributing to immune and metabolic dysfunction. Overall, our long read based analysis reveals novel sequential rearrangement processes initiated by HBV integration, hinting its structural and functional impact on HCC.",
