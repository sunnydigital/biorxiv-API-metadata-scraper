    "abstract": "The devastation caused by SARS-CoV-2 has made clear the importance of pandemic preparedness. To address future zoonotic outbreaks due to related viruses in the sarbecovirus subgenus, we identified a human monoclonal antibody, 10-40, that neutralized or bound all sarbecoviruses tested in vitro and protected against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in vivo. Comparative studies with other receptor-binding domain (RBD)-directed antibodies showed 10-40 to have the greatest breadth against sarbecoviruses and thus its promise as an agent for pandemic preparedness. Moreover, structural analyses on 10-40 and similar antibodies not only defined an epitope cluster in the inner face of the RBD that is well conserved among sarbecoviruses, but also uncovered a new antibody class with a common CDRH3 motif. Our analyses also suggested that elicitation of this class of antibodies may not be overly difficult, an observation that bodes well for the development of a pan-sarbecovirus vaccine.\n\nOne sentence summaryA monoclonal antibody that neutralizes or binds all sarbecoviruses tested and represents a reproducible antibody class.",

    "abstract": "MotivationBuilding reliable phylogenies from very large collections of sequences with a limited number of phylogenetically informative sites is challenging because sequencing errors and recurrent/backward mutations interfere with the phylogenetic signal, confounding true evolutionary relationships. Massive global efforts of sequencing genomes and reconstructing the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 strains exemplify these difficulties since there are only hundreds of phylogenetically informative sites and millions of genomes. For such datasets, we set out to develop a method for building the phylogenetic tree of genomic haplotypes consisting of positions harboring common variants to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for more accurate phylogenetic inference of resolvable phylogenetic features.\n\nResultsWe present the TopHap approach that determines spatiotemporally common haplotypes of common variants and builds their phylogeny at a fraction of the computational time of traditional methods. To assess topological robustness, we develop a bootstrap resampling strategy that resamples genomes spatiotemporally. The application of TopHap to build a phylogeny of 68,057 genomes (68KG) produced an evolutionary tree of major SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes. This phylogeny is concordant with the mutation tree inferred using the co-occurrence pattern of mutations and recovers key phylogenetic relationships from more traditional analyses. We also evaluated alternative roots of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny and found that the earliest sampled genomes in 2019 likely evolved by four mutations of the most recent common ancestor of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes. An application of TopHap to more than 1 million genomes reconstructed the most comprehensive evolutionary relationships of major variants, which confirmed the 68KG phylogeny and provided evolutionary origins of major variants of concern.\n\nAvailabilityTopHap is available on the web at https://github.com/SayakaMiura/TopHap.\n\nContacts.kumar@temple.edu",

We utilized a genetic algorithm approach for finding optimal candidates using the generation and scoring capabilities of the language model.

    "abstract": "The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants poses a threat to the human population where it is difficult to assess the severity of a particular variant of the virus. Spike protein and specifically its receptor binding domain (RBD) which makes direct interaction with the ACE2 receptor of the human has shown prominent amino acid substitutions in most of the Variants of Concern. Here, by using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations we compare the interaction of Wild-type RBD/ACE2 receptor complex with that of the latest Omicron variant of the virus. We observed a very interesting diversification of the charge, dynamics and energetics of the protein complex formed upon mutations. These results would help us in understanding the molecular basis of binding of the Omicron variant with that of SARS-CoV-2 Wild-type.\n\nTOC Graphics\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/472253v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e35dceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@23a441org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f4b7e3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1549a1c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant harbors 37 amino acid substitutions in the spike (S) protein, 15 of which are in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), thereby raising concerns about the effectiveness of available vaccines and antibody therapeutics. Here, we show that the Omicron RBD binds to human ACE2 with enhanced affinity relative to the Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD and acquires binding to mouse ACE2. Severe reductions of plasma neutralizing activity were observed against Omicron compared to the ancestral pseudovirus for vaccinated and convalescent individuals. Most (26 out of 29) receptor-binding motif (RBM)-directed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) lost in vitro neutralizing activity against Omicron, with only three mAbs, including the ACE2-mimicking S2K146 mAb1, retaining unaltered potency. Furthermore, a fraction of broadly neutralizing sarbecovirus mAbs recognizing antigenic sites outside the RBM, including sotrovimab2, S2X2593 and S2H974, neutralized Omicron. The magnitude of Omicron-mediated immune evasion and the acquisition of binding to mouse ACE2 mark a major SARS-CoV-2 mutational shift. Broadly neutralizing sarbecovirus mAbs recognizing epitopes conserved among SARS-CoV-2 variants and other sarbecoviruses may prove key to controlling the ongoing pandemic and future zoonotic spillovers.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of the mechanisms underpinning the development of protective immunity conferred by mRNA vaccines is fragmentary. Here we investigated responses to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination via ultra-low-volume sampling and high-temporal-resolution transcriptome profiling (23 subjects across 22 timepoints, and with 117 COVID-19 patients used as comparators). There were marked differences in the timing and amplitude of the responses to the priming and booster doses. Notably, we identified two distinct interferon signatures. The first signature (A28/S1) was robustly induced both post-prime and post-boost and in both cases correlated with the subsequent development of antibody responses. In contrast, the second interferon signature (A28/S2) was robustly induced only post-boost, where it coincided with a transient inflammation peak. In COVID19 patients, a distinct phenotype dominated by A28/S2 was associated with longer duration of intensive care. In summary, high-temporal-resolution transcriptomic permitted the identification of post- vaccination phenotypes that are determinants of the course of COVID-19 disease.",

    "abstract": "Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as a serious pandemic has altered the global socioeconomic dynamics. The wide prevalence, high death counts and rapid emergence of new variants urge for establishment of research infrastructure to facilitate rapid development of efficient therapeutic modalities and preventive measures. In agreement with this, five SARS-CoV2 strains (ILS01, ILS02, ILS03, ILS15 and ILS24) of four different clades (19A, 19B, 20A and 20B) were isolated from patient swab samples collected during the 1st COVID-19 wave in Odisha, India. The viral isolates were adapted to in-vitro cultures and further characterized to identify strain specific variations in viral growth characteristics. All the five isolates showed substantial amount of virus induced CPE however ILS03 belonging to 20A clade displayed highest level of CPE. Time kinetics experiment revealed spike protein expression was evident after 16th hours post infection in all five isolates. ILS03 induced around 90% of cytotoxicity. Further, the susceptibility of various cell lines (human hepatoma cell line (Huh-7), CaCo2 cell line, HEK-293T cells, Vero, Vero-E6, BHK-21, THP-1 cell line and RAW 264.7 cells) were assessed. Surprisingly, it was found that the human monocyte cells THP-1 and murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 were permissive to all the SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The neutralization susceptibility of viral isolates to vaccine-induced antibodies was determined using sera from individuals vaccinated in the Government run vaccine drive in India. The micro-neutralization assay suggested that both Covaxin and Covishield vaccines were equally effective (100% neutralization) against all of the isolates. The whole genome sequencing of culture adapted viral isolates and viral genome from patient oropharyngeal swab sample suggested that repetitive passaging of SARS-CoV2 virus in Vero-E6 cells did not lead to emergence of many mutations during the adaptation in cell culture. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the five isolates clustered to respective clades. The major goal was to isolate and adapt SARS-CoV-2 viruses in in-vitro cell culture with minimal modification to facilitate research activities involved in understanding the molecular virology, host-virus interactions, application of these strains for drug discovery and animal challenge models development which eventually will contribute towards the development of effective and reliable therapeutics.",

It is therefore the prominent target of neutralizing antibodies and consequently the antigen of all currently admitted vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Since it is a 1273-amino acids glycoprotein with 22 N-linked glycans, the production of functional, full-length spike protein was limited to mammalian and insect cells, requiring complex culture media. Here we report the production of full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein - lacking the C-terminal membrane anchor - as a secreted protein in the prefusion-stabilized conformation in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We show that the spike protein is efficiently cleaved at the furin cleavage site during synthesis in the alga and that cleavage is abolished upon mutation of the multi-basic cleavage site. We could enrich the spike protein from culture medium by ammonium sulfate precipitation and demonstrate its functionality based on its interaction with recombinant ACE2 and ACE2 expressed on human 293T cells. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a GRAS organism that can be cultivated at low cost in simple media at a large scale, making it an attractive production platform for recombinant spike protein and other biopharmaceuticals in low-income countries.",

    "abstract": "Glial cells are essential to understand Alzheimers disease (AD) progression, given their role in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. There is a need for reliable and easy to manipulate models that allow studying the mechanisms behind neuron and glia communication. Currently available models such as cocultures require complex methodologies and/or might not be affordable for all laboratories. With this in mind, we aimed to establish a straightforward in vitro setting with neurons and glial cells to study AD.\n\nWe generated a triple co-culture with neurons, microglia and astrocytes. Immunofluorescence, western blot and ELISA techniques were used to characterize the effects of oligomeric A{beta} (oA{beta}) in this model.\n\nWe found that, in the triple co-culture, microglia increased the expression of anti-inflammatory markers Arginase I and TGF-{beta}1, and reduced pro-inflammatory iNOS and IL-1{beta}, compared with microglia alone. Astrocytes reduced expression of pro-inflammatory A1 markers AMIGO2 and C3, and displayed a ramified morphology resembling physiological conditions. Lastly, neurons increased post-synaptic markers, and developed more and longer branches than in individual primary cultures. Addition of oA{beta} in the triple coculture reduced synaptic markers and increased microglial activation, which are hallmarks of AD.\n\nConsequently, we developed a reliable model, where cells better resemble physiological conditions: microglia are less inflammatory, astrocytes are less reactive and neurons display a more mature morphology than in individual primary cultures. Moreover, we were able to recapitulate A{beta}-induced synaptic loss and inflammation. This model emerges as a powerful tool to study neurodegeneration and inflammation in the context of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nTable of content image O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY\n\nMain pointsO_LIIn our model, microglia and astrocytes are less reactive, and neurons have a more mature morphology than in primary cultures.\nC_LIO_LIoA{beta} reduced synaptic markers and increased microglial activation.\nC_LIO_LIThis triple co-culture is a reliable tool to study neurodegeneration and gliosis in vitro.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Enzymes that facilitate the local deposition of electron dense reaction products have been widely used as labels in electron microscopy (EM). Peroxidases, in particular, can efficiently metabolize 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride hydrate (DAB) to produce precipitates with high contrast under EM following heavy metal staining, and can be genetically encoded to facilitate the labeling of specific cell-types or organelles. Nevertheless, the peroxidase/DAB method has so far not been reported to work in combination with 3D volume EM techniques (e.g. Serial blockface electron microscopy, SBEM; Focused ion beam electron microscopy, FIBSEM) because the surfactant treatment needed for efficient reagent penetration disrupts tissue ultrastructure and because these methods require the deposition of large amounts of heavy metals that can obscure DAB precipitates. However, a recently described peroxidase with enhanced enzymatic activity (dAPEX2) appears to successfully deposit EM-visible DAB products in thick tissue without surfactant treatment. Here we demonstrate that multiplexed dAPEX2/DAB tagging is compatible with both FIBSEM and SBEM volume EM approaches and use them to map long-range genetically identified synaptic inputs from the anterior cingulate cortex to the periaqueductal gray in the mouse brain.",

    "abstract": "The traditional view of neural computation in the cerebral cortex holds that sensory neurons are specialized, i.e., selective for certain dimensions of sensory stimuli. This view was challenged by evidence of contextual interactions between stimulus dimensions in which a neurons response to one dimension strongly depends on other dimensions. Here we use methods of mathematical modeling, psychophysics, and electrophysiology to address shortcomings of the traditional view. Using a model of a generic cortical circuit, we begin with the simple demonstration that cortical responses are always distributed among neurons, forming characteristic waveforms, which we call neural waves. When stimulated by patterned stimuli, circuit responses arise by interference of neural waves. Resulting patterns of interference depend on interaction between stimulus dimensions. Comparison of these modeled responses with responses of biological vision makes it clear that the framework of neural wave interference provides a useful alternative to the standard concept of neural computation.\n\nTeaserInvestigating interference of neural waves helps to overcome limitations of the traditional view of cortical computation.",

    "abstract": "Microbiome in the human body environment is related to the occurrence of a variety of disease phenotypes. Recent studies discovered that lung is an open organism with in touch of air and microbe in it, and the presence of some microbes in lung cancer tissues proved that there are many microbes in lungs. In this project, we collected lung tissue, feces and sputum from three Bioprojects of NCBI related to lung cancer (LC). Each project contains LC cases and lung normal (LN) controls. Those three projects contain a total of 339 samples of 16s rRNA sequencing data. By analyzing the composition of microbes in the three environments, and predicting their functions we found that compared with sputum, the ecological environment of fecal microbe is closer to tissue microbes in terms of evolutionary relationship, indicating that the impact of feces on tissue microbes is greater than that of the sputum. We used Picrust2 to predict the differential microbe function of lung cancer (LC) and the control (Lung Normal, LN) groups in the three environments, and found that at the microbe genetic level, compared to feces and sputum, sputum and tissues, feces and tissues have more common Differential genes, at the level of differential enzyme genes and differential pathways, feces and tissues have more common differences compared to feces and sputum, sputum and tissues. Our results showed that the similarity of feces and tissue microbiome is closer than the similarity of sputum and feces microbe. Through Spearman correlation analysis based on the relative abundance of predicted pathways and the relative abundance of genus classified by LDA analysis as marker diseases and healthy samples. The results indicated that the activation of marker genus in sputum and feces and significantly changed pathways has an opposite trend, and there are many pathways contributing to glycolysis are correlated with marker genus. Patients with LC has potential to regulate the microbe composition of feces, tissues and sputum by regulating metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Sponges (phylum Porifera) are ancient, filtering, multicellular metazoans. Freshwater sponges (Demosponges, Lubomirskiidae) dominate the fauna of the littoral zone of Lake Baikal. Over the last years, there have been mass diseases and death of endemic sponges. Previously, the strain Janthinobacterium sp. SLB01 was isolated from the diseased sponge Lubomirskia baicalensis. The studies of the pathogenicity of the strain Janthinobacterium sp. SLB01 for Baikal sponges has not been carried out. Therefore we infected experimentally in vitro to determine its pathogenicity by the cell culture of the primmorphs with subsequent isolation, sequencing, and analysis of the genomes. The purpose of the study is to show that the strain Janthinobacterium sp. SLB01 isolated from the diseased sponge L. baicalensis is a pathogen for the cell culture of primmorphs. The bacteria from the infected samples of the primmorphs were isolated and identified as strain Janthinobacterium sp. PLB02. A comparative analysis of the genomes of the strains Janthinobacterium sp. SLB01 and Janthinobacterium sp. PLB02 showed that they are practically identical. The genomes of both strains contain genes vioABCDE violacein, flok formation, and strong biofilm, and the type VI secretion system (T6SS), as the primary virulence factor. The bacterial strains Janthinobacterium sp. based on a comparison of complete genomes showed similarity with strain Janthinobacterium lividum MTR. Isolated our strains of Janthinobacterium sp. are pathogens for cell cultures of primmorphs and L. baicalensis sponges. The results of the study will help to expand the understanding of microbial relationships in the development of disease and the death of Baikal sponges.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY/ABSTRACTMammalian sex chromosomes encode homologous X/Y gene pairs that were retained on the male Y and escape X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in females. Inferred to reflect X/Y-pair dosage sensitivity, monosomy X is a leading cause of miscarriage in humans with near full penetrance. This phenotype is shared with many other mammals but not the mouse, which offers sophisticated genetic tools to generate sex chromosomal aneuploidy but also tolerates its developmental impact. To address this critical gap, we generated X-monosomic human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) alongside otherwise isogenic euploid controls from male and female mosaic samples. Phased genomic variants of these hiPSC panels enable systematic investigation of X/Y dosage-sensitive features using in vitro models of human development.\n\nHere, we demonstrate the utility of these validated hiPSC lines to test how X/Y-linked gene dosage impacts a widely-used model for the human syncytiotrophoblast. While these isogenic panels trigger a GATA2/3 and TFAP2A/C -driven trophoblast gene circuit irrespective of karyotype, differential expression implicates monosomy X in altered levels of placental genes, and in secretion of placental growth factor (PlGF) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Remarkably, weighted gene co-expression network modules that significantly reflect these changes are also preserved in first-trimester chorionic villi and term placenta. Our results suggest monosomy X may skew trophoblast cell type composition, and that the pseudoautosomal region likely plays a key role in these changes, which may facilitate prioritization of haploinsufficient drivers of 45,X extra-embryonic phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Convergent evolution, where independent lineages evolve similar traits when adapting to similar habitats, is a common phenomenon and testament to the repeatability of evolutionary processes. Still, non-convergence is also common, and a major question is whether apparently idiosyncratic, lineage-specific evolutionary changes are reflective of chance events inherent to evolutionary processes, or whether they are also influenced by deterministic genetic or ecological factors. To address this question, we quantified the degree of convergence in genome-wide patterns of gene expression across lineages of livebearing fishes (family Poeciliidae) that span 40 million years of evolution and have colonized extreme environments in the form of toxic, hydrogen-sulfide-rich springs. We specifically asked whether the degree of convergence across lineage pairs was related to their phylogenetic relatedness or the ecological similarity of the habitats they inhabit. Using phylogenetic comparative analyses, we showed that the degree of convergence was highly variable across lineage pairs residing in sulfide springs. While closely related lineages did not exhibit higher degrees of convergence than distantly related ones, we uncovered a strong relationship between degree of convergence and ecological similarity. Our results indicate that variation in the degree of convergence is not merely noise associated with evolutionary contingency. Rather, cryptic environmental variation that is frequently ignored when we employ reductionist approaches can significantly contribute to adaptive evolution. This study highlights the importance of multivariate approaches that capture the complexities of both selective regimes and organismal design when assessing the roles of determinism and contingency in evolution.\n\nSignificance StatementWhen different species adapt to similar environmental conditions, we frequently observe a mix between shared (convergent) and lineage-specific (nonconvergent) evolutionary changes. Shared changes provide evidence for the repeatability and predictability of evolution. However, it remains unclear whether lineage-specific changes are caused by random forces that limit the predictability of evolution, or whether they reflect deterministic processes shaped by unidentified genetic and environmental factors. By analyzing patterns of gene expression across fishes in extreme environments, we show that the degree of convergence between lineages is related to ecology, indicating that lineage-specific evolutionary changes are not just noise caused by random processes. Thus, acknowledging the complexity of nature in empirical research is critical if we want to predict evolution.",

Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we have determined structures of AtAtm3 in multiple conformational states. These structures not only provide a structural framework for defining the alternating access transport cycle, but also highlight an unappreciated feature of the glutathione binding site, namely the paucity of cysteine residues that could potentially form inhibitory mixed disulfides with glutathione. Despite extensive efforts, we were unable to prepare the ternary complex of AtAtm3 with bound GSSG and MgATP. A survey of structurally characterized type IV ABC transporters that includes AtAtm3 establishes that while nucleotides are found associated with all conformational states, they are effectively required to stabilize occluded and outward-facing conformations. In contrast, transport substrates have only been observed associated with inward-facing conformations. The absence of structures containing both nucleotide and transport substrate suggests that this ternary complex exists only transiently during the transport cycle.",

    "abstract": "Humans are exposed to numerous compounds daily, some of which have adverse effects on health. Computational approaches for modeling toxicological data in conjunction with machine learning algorithms have gained popularity over the last few years. Machine learning approaches have been used to predict toxicity-related biological activities using chemical structure descriptors. However, toxicity-related proteomic features have not been fully investigated. In this study, we construct a computational pipeline using machine learning models for predicting the most important protein features responsible for the toxicity of compounds taken from the Tox21 dataset that is implemented within the multiscale Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities (CANDO) therapeutic discovery platform. Tox21 is a highly imbalanced dataset consisting of twelve in vitro assays, seven from the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway and five from the stress response (SR) pathway, for more than 10,000 compounds. For the machine learning model, we employed a random forest with the combination of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN) method (SMOTE+ENN), which is a resampling method to balance the activity class distribution. Within the NR and SR pathways, the activity of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (NR-AhR), and mitochondrial membrane potential (SR-MMP) were two of the top-performing twelve toxicity endpoints with AUCROCs of 0.90 and 0.92, respectively. The top extracted features for evaluating compound toxicity were analyzed for enrichment to highlight the implicated biological pathways and proteins. We validated our enrichment results for the activity of the AhR using a thorough literature search. Our case study showed that the selected enriched pathways and proteins from our computational pipeline are not only correlated with AhR toxicity but also form a cascading upstream/downstream arrangement. Our work elucidate significant relationships between protein and compound interactions computed using CANDO and the associated biological pathways to which the proteins belong for twelve toxicity endpoints. This novel study uses machine learning not only to predict and understand toxicity but also elucidates therapeutic mechanisms at a proteomic level for a variety of toxicity endpoints.",

Secretome (SASP) of radiation-induced senescent (RIS) endothelium enhances genomic instability and intratumoral heterogeneity in irradiated GBM cells. In-depth molecular studies revealed that CXCL5 and CXCL8, from the SASP, activate CXCR2 receptor on tumor cells leading to increased DNA hyper-replication, micronuclei formation and aneuploidy. Importantly, through CXCL5/8-CXCR2 axis activation, this SASP increases GBM aggressiveness in vivo. Both chemokines were detected in relapsing, but not primary, GBM biopsies and positively correlated with worst patient outcome. In conclusion, we identify new molecular and preclinical insights of relapsing GBM aggressiveness where RIS vascular niches fuel aggressive tumor emergence.",

    "abstract": "Real-time fMRI (rtfMRI)has enormous potential for both mechanistic brain imaging studies or treatment-oriented neuromodulation. However, the adaption of rtfMRI has been limited due to technical difficulties implement an efficient computational framework. Here, we introduce a python library for real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) data processing systems, Real-Time Processing System in python (RTPSpy), to provide building blocks for a custom rtfMRI application with extensive and advanced functionalities. RTPSpy is a library package including 1) a fast, comprehensive, and flexible online fMRI image processing modules comparable to offline denoising, 2) utilities for fast and accurate anatomical image processing to define an anatomical target region, 3) a simulation system of online fMRI processing to optimize a pipeline and target signal calculation, 4) simple interface to an external application for feedback presentation, and 5) a boilerplate graphical user interface (GUI) integrating operations with RTPSpy library. The fast and accurate anatomical image processing utility wraps external tools, including FastSurfer, ANTs, and AFNI, to make tissue segmentation and region of interest masks. We confirmed that the quality of the output masks was comparable with FreeSurfer, and the anatomical image processing could complete in a few minutes. The modular nature of RTPSpy provides the ability to use it for a simulation analysis to optimize a processing pipeline and target signal calculation. We present a sample script for building a real-time processing pipeline and running a simulation using RTPSpy. The library also offers a simple signal exchange mechanism with an external application using a TCP/IP socket. While the main components of the RTPSpy are the library modules, we also provide a GUI class for easy access to the RTPSpy functions. The boilerplate GUI application provided with the package allows users to develop a customized rtfMRI application with minimum scripting labor. The limitations of the package as it relates to environment-specific implementations are discussed. These library components can be customized and can be used in parts. Taken together, RTPSpy is an efficient and adaptable option for developing rtfMRI applications. The package is available from GitHub (https://github.com/mamisaki/RTPSpy) with GPL3 license.",

    "abstract": "Coordinated whole-brain neural dynamics are essential for proper control of the functionality of different brain systems. Multisite simultaneous or sequential stimulations may provide tools for mechanistic studies of brain functions and the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Conventional circular and figure-8 Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) coils occupy a large footprint, and it is difficult to reach desired multiple stimulation locations with close proximity for comprehensive multisite stimulations. These conventional coils, limited by the depth-spread tradeoff rule, also lack the required focality for targeted stimulations. In this work, we propose and demonstrate angle-tuned TMS (AT) coils with an intrinsically reduced footprint with their geometric arrangements of stacking and angle tuning. The stimulation depth can be adjusted with the coil stacking number, and the field spread can be reduced by increasing the tilted wire-wrapping angle of the coils. With either smaller or larger diameter coils than a standard commercial figure-8 coil, we show, theoretically and experimentally, improved field decay rate and field intensity, and the reduced field spread spot size at different stimulation depths. These results indicate that the proposed novel coil establishes a better depth-spread tradeoff curve than the conventional circular and figure-8 coils. This coil design has a simple and single element structure and provides a promising solution for an improved multisite brain stimulation performance and serves as the building block of more complex coils for further depth-spread improvements.",

Many descriptions of salivary microbiome diversity compare commonalities and differences with reference to a diseased state, but the composition of healthy saliva has not been described. Here, we use a meta-analysis approach to define and explore the core membership of the human salivary microbial community by collecting and re-analysing raw 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data from 47 studies with 2206 saliva samples. We found 68 core bacterial taxa that were consistently detected. Differences induced by various host intrinsic and behaviour factors, including gender, age, geographic location, tobacco usage, and alcohol consumption, were evident. The core of the salivary microbiome was verified by collecting and analysing saliva in an independent study. These results suggest that the methods used can effectively define a core microbial community in human saliva with high prevalence. The core salivary microbiome demonstrated both stability and variability among populations. Geographic location was identified as the host factor with the largest effect in shaping salivary microbiota. The independent analysis underlined that the impact of geographic variation is likely due to diet.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities in many ecosystems are facing a broad range of global change drivers, such as nutrient enrichment, chemical pollution, and temperature change. These drivers can cause changes in the abundance of taxa, the composition of communities, and the properties of ecosystems. While the influence of single drivers is already described in numerous studies, the effect and predictability of multiple drivers changing simultaneously is still poorly understood. In this study, we used 240 highly replicable oxic/anoxic aquatic lab microcosms and four drivers (fertilizer, glyphosate, metal pollution, antibiotics) in all possible combinations at three different temperatures (20 {degrees}C, 24 {degrees}C, and 28 {degrees}C) to shed light into consequences of multiple drivers on different levels of organization, ranging from species abundance to community and ecosystem parameters. We found (i) that at all levels of ecological organisation, combinations of drivers can change the biological consequence and direction of effect compared to single drivers (ii), that effects of combinations are further modified by temperature, (iii) that a larger number of drivers occurring simultaneously is often quite closely related to their effect size, and (iv) that there is little evidence that any of these effects are associated with the level of ecological organisation of the state variable. These findings suggest that, at least in this experimental ecosystem approximating a stratified aquatic ecosystem, there may be relatively little scope for predicting the effects of combinations of drivers from the effects of individual drivers, or by accounting for the level of ecological organisation in question, though there may be some scope for prediction based on the number of drivers that are occurring simultaneous. A priority, though also a considerable challenge, is to extend such research to consider continuous variation in the magnitude of multiple drivers acting together.",

    "abstract": "Lysosome membranes contain diverse phosphoinositide (PtdIns) lipids that co-ordinate lysosome function and dynamics. The PtdIns repertoire on lysosomes is tightly regulated by the action of diverse PtdIns kinases and phosphatases. Specific roles for PtdIns in lysosomal function and dynamics are currently unclear and require further investigation. PIKfyve, a lipid kinase which synthesizes PtdIns(3,5)P2 from PtdIns(3)P, controls lysosome \"fusion-fission\" cycles dynamics, autophagosome turnover and endocytic cargo delivery. We have recently characterized a role for INPP4B, a PtdIns phosphatase which hydrolyses PtdIns(3,4)P2 to form PtdIns(3)P, in the regulation of lysosomal biogenesis and function. To gain a better understanding of PtdIns homeostasis on lysosomes, we investigated the consequence of disrupting PIKfyve in Inpp4b-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Surprisingly, simultaneous inhibition of Inpp4b and PIKfyve functions impair lysosome \"fission\" dynamics and thereby exacerbate lysosome enlargement, inhibit autophagic flux. Further examination into the underlying processes that may explain exaggerated lysosome enlargement revealed elevated levels of lysosome associated PtdIns(3)P as contributing factors that control lysosome morphology in cells where Inpp4b and PIKfyve are disrupted. Overall, our study suggests that lysosomal functions are regulated by Inpp4b, through a paradoxical role in suppressing the induction of PtdIns(3)P production.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTIn this study we identify a novel crosstalk between Inpp4b and PIKfyve. This crosstalk regulates lysosome membrane phosphoinositide composition and lysosomal homeostasis. Our data demonstrate that Inpp4b restricts VPS34-dependent induction of PtdIns(3)P levels, which is activated upon apilimod-mediated PIKfyve inhibition. Through this mechanism, Inpp4b contributes to the regulation of lysosomal membrane dynamics and homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Left ventricular hypertrophy, characterized by hypertrophy of individual cardiomyocytes, is an adaptive response to an increased cardiac workload that eventually leads to heart failure. Previous studies using neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) and animal models have revealed several genes and signaling pathways associated with hypertrophy and mechanical load. However, these models are not directly applicable to humans. Here, we studied the effect of cyclic mechanical stretch on gene expression of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) using RNA sequencing. hiPSC-CMs showed distinct hypertrophic changes in gene expression at the level of individual genes and in biological processes. We also identified several differentially expressed genes that have not been previously associated with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and thus serve as attractive targets for future studies. When compared to previously published data attained from stretched NRVMs and human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, hiPSC-CMs displayed a smaller number of changes in gene expression, but the differentially expressed genes revealed more pronounced enrichment of hypertrophy-related biological processes and pathways. Overall, these results establish hiPSC-CMs as a valuable in vitro model for studying human cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.\n\nNon-standard Abbreviations and AcronymsET-1, endothelin-1; GO, gene ontology; hESC-CM, human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte; hiPSC, human induced pluripotent stem cell; hiPSC-CM, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2; NRVM, neonatal rat ventricular myocyte; PKC, protein kinase C; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RB+, RPMI 1640 supplemented with B-27; RB-, RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with B-27 without insulin; RT, room temperature; TF, transcription factor",

However, the mechanisms of NAFLD-associated vasculopathy remain understudied. We developed blood outgrowth endothelial cell (BOEC) models from NAFLD and healthy subjects. NAFLD BOECs exhibited global transcriptional upregulation of chemokine hallmarks and human leukocyte antigens. In mouse models of diet-induced NAFLD, we further confirmed enhanced endothelial expressions of CXCL12 in the aortas and liver vasculatures. To elucidate endothelial-immune crosstalk, we performed immunoprofiling by single-cell analysis, uncovering T cell intensification and potentially T-helper type 1 inflammation in NAFLD patients. Functionally, interference of the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis by small molecule AMD3100 selectively modulated the chemotaxis of patient-derived CD4+ T cells and natural killer cells towards NAFLD BOECs, restoring endothelial barrier integrity. Clinically, we detected three folds more circulating damaged endothelial cells in NAFLD patients than healthy controls. Our work provides insights for modulation of interactions with effector immune subsets to mitigate endothelial injury in NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "PTEN is one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene in cancer. PTEN is generally altered in invasive cancers such as glioblastomas, but its function in collective cell migration and invasion is not fully characterized. Herein, we report that the loss of PTEN increases cell speed during collective migration of non-tumourous cells both in vitro and in vivo. We further show that loss of PTEN promotes LKB1-dependent phosphorylation and activation of the major metabolic regulator AMPK. In turn AMPK increases VASP phosphorylation, reduces VASP localization at cell-cell junctions and decreases the interjunctional transverse actin arcs at the leading front, provoking a weakening of cell-cell contacts and increasing migration speed. Targeting AMPK activity not only slows down PTEN-depleted cells, it also limits PTEN-null glioblastoma cell invasion, opening new opportunities to treat glioblastoma lethal invasiveness.",

    "abstract": "Neural circuit formation and function require that diverse neurons are specified in appropriate numbers. Known strategies for controlling neuronal numbers involve regulating either cell proliferation or survival. We used the Drosophila visual system to probe how neuronal numbers are set. Photoreceptors from the eye-disc induce their target field, the lamina, such that for every unit eye there is a corresponding lamina unit (column). Although each column initially contains [~]6 post-mitotic lamina precursors, only 5 differentiate into neurons, called L1-L5; the  extra precursor, which is invariantly positioned above the L5 neuron in each column, undergoes apoptosis. Here, we showed that a glial population called the outer chiasm giant glia (xgO), which resides below the lamina, secretes multiple ligands to induce L5 differentiation in response to EGF from photoreceptors. By forcing neuronal differentiation in the lamina, we uncovered that though fated to die, the  extra precursor is specified as an L5. Therefore, two precursors are specified as L5s but only one differentiates during normal development. We found that the row of precursors nearest to xgO differentiate into L5s and, in turn, antagonise differentiation signalling to prevent the  extra precursors from differentiating, resulting in their death. Thus, an intricate interplay of glial signals and feedback from differentiating neurons defines an invariant and stereotyped pattern of neuronal differentiation and programmed cell death to ensure that lamina columns each contain exactly one L5 neuron.",

    "abstract": "Landscape dynamics and river network rearrangements are widely thought to shape the diversity of Neotropical freshwater fishes, the most species-rich continental vertebrate fauna on Earth. Yet the effects of hydrogeographic changes on fish dispersal and diversification remain poorly understood. Here we integrate an unprecedented occurrence dataset of 4,967 South American freshwater fish species with a species-dense phylogeny to track the evolutionary processes associated with hydrogeographic events over 100 Ma. Net lineage diversification was heterogeneous through time, across space, and among clades. Three abrupt shifts in diversification rates occurred during the Paleogene (between 63 and 23 Ma) in association with major landscape evolution events, and net diversification accelerated from the Miocene to the Recent (c. 20 - 0 Ma). The Western Amazon exhibited the highest rates of in situ diversification and was also the most important source of species dispersing to other regions. All regional biotic interchanges were associated with documented hydrogeographic events and the formation of biogeographic corridors, including Early Miocene (c. 20 Ma) uplift of the Serra do Mar, and Late Miocene (c. 10 Ma) uplift of the Northern Andes and formation of the modern transcontinental Amazon River. Reciprocal mass dispersal of fishes between the Western and Eastern Amazon coincided with this phase of Andean uplift. The Western Amazon has the highest contemporary levels of species richness and phylogenetic endemism. Our results support the hypothesis that landscape dynamics were constrained by the history of drainage basin connections, strongly affecting the assembly and diversification of basin-wide fish faunas.\n\nSignificance StatementDespite progress in mapping geographic distributions and genealogical relationships, scientists have few clear answers about the origins of South American freshwater fishes, the most diverse vertebrate fauna on Earth. Here we used the most complete dataset of geographic distributions and evolutionary relationships of South American fishes to track how the geological history of river dynamics influenced the origin, extinction, and interchange of species over the past 100 Ma. We found abrupt increases of species origination between 66 and 23 Ma, coinciding with repeated uplifts of the Andes. The Western Amazon region served as source of freshwater fishes to other regions, as a place where species tended to persist over longer historical periods, and where species originations occurred with higher frequency.",

Increasing effort is being dedicated to design experimental protocols for selecting community-level functions of interest. These experiments typically involve selection acting on populations of communities, each of which is composed of multiple species. Numerical simulations explored the evolutionary dynamics of this complex, multi-scale system. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the process of artificial selection of communities is still lacking. Here, we propose a general model for the evolutionary dynamics of communities composed of a large number of interacting species, described by disordered generalized Lotka-Volterra equations. Our analytical and numerical results reveal that selection for total community abundance leads to increased levels of mutualism and interaction diversity. Correspondingly, the interaction matrix acquires a specific structure that is generic for selection of collective functions. Our approach moreover allows to disentangle the role of different control parameters in determining the efficiency of the selection process, and can thus be used as a guidance in optimizing artificial selection protocols.",

    "abstract": "Conflicting studies place a group of bilaterian invertebrates containing xenoturbellids and acoelomorphs, the Xenacoelomorpha, as either the primary emerging bilaterian phylum, or within Deuterostomia, sister to Ambulacraria. While their placement as sister to the rest of Bilateria supports relatively simple morphology in the ancestral bilaterian, their alternative placement within Deuterostomia suggests a morphologically complex ancestral Bilaterian along with extensive loss of major phenotypic traits in the Xenacoelomorpha. More recently, further studies have brought into question whether Deuterostomia should be considered monophyletic at all. Hidden paralogy presents a major challenge for reconstructing species phylogenies. Here we assess whether hidden paralogy has contributed to the conflict over the placement of Xenacoelomorpha. Our approach assesses previously published datasets, enriching for orthogroups whose gene trees support well resolved clans elsewhere in the animal tree of life. We find that the majority of constituent genes in previously published datasets violate incontestable clans, suggesting that hidden paralogy is rife at this depth. We demonstrate that enrichment for genes with orthologous signal alters the final topology that is inferred, whilst simultaneously improving fit of the model to the data. We discover increased, but ultimately not conclusive, support for the existence of Xenambulacraria in our orthology enriched set of genes. At a time when we are steadily progressing towards sequencing all of life on the planet, we argue that long-standing contentious issues in the tree of life will be resolved using smaller amounts of better quality data that can be modelled adequately.",

    "abstract": "G-Quadruplex structures are non-B DNA structures that occur in regions carrying short runs of guanines. They are implicated in several biological processes including transcription, translation, replication and telomere maintenance as well as in several pathological conditions like cancer and thus they have gained the attention of the scientific community. The rise of the -omics era significantly affected the G-quadruplex research and the genome-wide characterization of G-Quadruplexes has been rendered a necessary first step towards applying genomics approaches for their study. While in human and several model organisms there is a considerable number of works studying genome-wide the DNA motifs with potential to form G-quadruplexes (G4-motifs), there is a total absence of any similar studies regarding livestock animals. The objectives of the present study were to provide a detailed characterization of the bovine genic G4-motifs distribution and properties and to suggest a possible mechanism for the delivery of G4 motifs in the genes. Our data indicate that the distribution of G4s within bovine genes and the annotation of said genes to Gene Ontology terms are similar to what is already shown for other organisms. By investigating their structural characteristics and polymorphism, it is obvious that the overall stability of the putative quadruplex structures is in line with the current notion in the G4 field. Similarly to human, the bovine G4s are overrepresented in specific LINE repeat elements, the L1_BTs in the case of cattle. We suggest these elements as vehicles for delivery of G4 motifs in the introns of the bovine genes. Lastly, it seems that a basis exists for connecting traits of agricultural importance to the genetic variation of G4 motifs, thus, cattle could become an interesting new model organism for G4-related genetic studies.",

    "abstract": "Prolactin, a hormone involved in vertebrate parental care, is hypothesized to inhibit reproductive hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis activity during parenting, thus maintaining investment in the current brood as opposed to new reproductive efforts. While prolactin underlies many parental behaviors in birds, its effects on other reproductive behaviors, such as courtship, remain unstudied. How prolactin affects neuropeptide and hormone receptor expression across the avian HPG axis also remains unknown. To address these questions, we administered ovine prolactin (oPRL) or a vehicle control to both sexes in experienced pairs of the biparental rock dove (Columba livia), after nest removal at the end of incubation. We found that oPRL promoted parental responses to novel chicks and stimulated crop growth compared to controls, consistent with other studies. However, we found that neither courtship behaviors, copulation rates nor pair maintenance differed with oPRL treatment. Across the HPG, we found oPRL had little effect on gene expression in hypothalamic nuclei, but increased expression of FSHB and hypothalamic hormone receptor genes in the pituitary. In the gonads, oPRL increased testes size and gonadotropin receptor expression, but did not affect ovarian state or small white follicle gene expression. However, the oviducts of oPRL-treated females were smaller and had lower estrogen receptor expression compared with controls. Our results highlight that some species, especially those that show multiple brooding, may be able to maintain mating behavior despite elevated prolactin. Thus, mechanisms may exist for prolactin to promote investment in parental care without concurrent inhibition of reproductive function or HPG axis activity.",

    "abstract": "Physical activity benefits both fitness and cognition. However, its effect on long-term memory is unclear. Successful memory involves not only remembering information over time but also keeping memories distinct and less confusing. The ability to separate similar experiences into distinct memories is one of the main features of episodic memory. In this work, we evaluated the effect of acute and chronic physical activity on a new task to assess spatial pattern separation in a 3D virtual reality environment. We manipulated the load of memory similarity and found that 25 minutes of cycling after encoding - but not before retrieval - was sufficient to improve similar, but not dissimilar memories, 24 hours after encoding. Furthermore, we found that participants who engaged in regular physical activity, but not sedentary subjects, showed memory for the similar condition the next day. Thus, physical activity could be a simple way to improve discrimination of spatial memories in humans.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWLarge-scale genotype-phenotype screens provide a wealth of data for identifying molecular alterations associated with a phenotype. Epistatic effects play an important role in such association studies. For example, siRNA perturbation screens can be used to identify combinatorial gene-silencing effects. In bacteria, epistasis has practical consequences in determining antimicrobial resistance as the genetic background of a strain plays an important role in determining resistance. Recently developed tools scale to human exome-wide screens for pairwise interactions, but none to date have included the possibility of three-way interactions. Expanding upon recent state-of-the art methods, we make a number of improvements to the performance on large-scale data, making consideration of three-way interactions possible. We demonstrate our proposed method, Pint, on both simulated and real data sets, including antibiotic resistance testing and siRNA perturbation screens. Pint outperforms known methods in simulated data, and identifies a number of biologically plausible gene effects in both the antibiotic and siRNA models. For example, we have identified a combination of known tumor suppressor genes that is predicted (using Pint) to cause a significant increase in cell proliferation.\n\nAO_SCPLOWUTHORC_SCPLOW SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWIn recent years, large-scale genetic datasets have become available for analysis. These large datasets often stretch the limits of classic computational methods, requiring too much memory or simply taking a prohibitively long time to run. Due to the enormous number of potential interactions, each gene or variation in the data is often modeled on its own, without considering interactions between them. Recently, methods have been developed to solve regression problems that include these interacting effects. Even the fastest of these cannot include threeway interactions, however. We improve upon one such method, developing an approach that is significantly faster than the current state of the art. Moreover, our method scales to three-way interactions among thousands of genes, while avoiding a number of the limitations of previous approaches. We analyse large-scale simulated data, antibiotic resistance, and gene-silencing datasets to demonstrate the accuracy and performance of our approach.",

However, work in this area is heterogeneous and diverse, making comparison of models and methods difficult.

We introduce the ProteinGLUE benchmark for the evaluation of protein representations: a set of seven tasks for evaluating learned protein representations. We also offer reference code, and we provide two baseline models with hyperparameters specifically trained for these benchmarks.\n\nPre-training was done on two tasks, masked symbol prediction and next sentence prediction. We show that pre-training yields higher performance on a variety of downstream tasks such as secondary structure and protein interaction interface prediction, compared to no pre-training. However, the larger base model does not outperform the smaller medium. We expect the ProteinGLUE benchmark dataset introduced here, together with the two baseline pre-trained models and their performance evaluations, to be of great value to the field of protein sequence-based property prediction.\n\nAvailabilitycode and datasets from https://github.com/ibivu/protein-glue",

This technique requires the accurate measurement of intensities to sensitively determine differences across Bijvoet pairs, making it a stringent test for the reliability of a data collection method. Although SAD experiments are commonly conducted at cryogenic temperatures to mitigate the effects of radiation damage, such temperatures can alter the conformational ensemble of the protein crystal and may impede the merging of data from multiple crystals due to non-uniform freezing. Here, we propose a data collection strategy to obtain high-quality data from room temperature samples. To illustrate the strengths of this approach we use native SAD phasing at 6.5 keV to solve four structures of three model systems at 295 K. The resulting datasets allow for automatic phasing and model building, and exhibit alternate conformations that are well-supported by the electron density. The high-redundancy data collection method demonstrated here enables the routine collection of high-quality, room-temperature diffraction to improve the study of protein conformational ensembles.",

Here, we investigated the prognostic value of RANK expression and its functionality in human BC. We analyzed RANK and RANKL expression in more than 1500 BC cases (777 being estrogen receptor-negative (ER-)) from four independent cohorts. We confirmed that RANK is more frequently expressed in ER- tumors, but it is also found in a subset of ER+ tumors. In ER- BC, RANK expression was independently associated with poor outcome, especially in postmenopausal patients and those who received adjuvant chemotherapy. Gene expression analyses unraveled distinct biology associated with RANK in relation to ER expression and menopause, and evidenced enhanced RANK activation in ER- postmenopausal tumors, together with regulation of metabolic pathways. Functional studies and transcriptomic analyses in ER- RANK+ patients-derived orthoxenografts demonstrated that activation of RANK signaling pathway promotes tumor cell proliferation and stemness, and regulates multiple biological processes including tumor immune surveillance and metabolism. Our results demonstrate that RANK expression is an independent poor prognosis biomarker in postmenopausal ER- BC patients and support the rational of using RANK pathway inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy in ER- BC.",

The disease is characterised by cerebral small vessel and white matter pathology, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Classically, the microvascular and tissue damage has been considered secondary to extrinsic factors, such as hypertension, consisting of microvessel stiffening, impaired vasoreactivity and blood-brain barrier dysfunction identified in human sporadic SVDs. However, increasing evidence points to an underlying vulnerability to SVD-related brain damage, not just extrinsic factors. Here, in a novel normotensive transgenic rat model where the phospholipase flippase Atp11b is deleted, we show pathological, imaging and behavioural changes typical of those in human sporadic SVD, but that occur without hypertension. These changes are due to an intrinsic endothelial cell dysfunction, identified in vessels of the brain white matter and the retina, with pathological evidence of vasoreactivity and blood-brain barrier deficits, which precipitate a secondary maturation block in oligodendroglia and myelin disruption around the small vessels. This highlights that an intrinsic endothelial dysfunction may underlie vulnerability to human sporadic SVD, providing alternative therapeutic targets to prevent a major cause of stroke and dementia.",

Analog-to-digital transduction and digital signal transmission call for distinct spike initiation properties (filters) and those filters should, therefore, differ between the AIS and distal axon. Here we show that unlike the AIS, which spikes repetitively during sustained depolarization, the axon spikes transiently and only if depolarization reaches threshold before KV1 channels activate. Rate of depolarization is critical. This was shown by optogenetically evoking spikes in the distal axon of CA1 pyramidal neurons using different photostimulus waveforms and pharmacological conditions while recording antidromically propagated spikes at the soma, thus circumventing the prohibitive difficulty of patching intact axons. Computational modeling shows that KV1 channels in the axon implement a high-pass filter that is matched to the axial current waveform associated with spike propagation, thus maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio to ensure high-fidelity transmission of spike-based signals.",

    "abstract": "Defense-associated sirtuins (DSR) comprise a family of proteins that defend bacteria from phage infection via an unknown mechanism. These proteins are common in bacteria and harbor an N-terminal sirtuin (SIR2) domain. In this study we report that DSR proteins degrade nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) during infection, depleting the cell of this essential molecule and aborting phage propagation. Our data show that one of these proteins, DSR2, directly identifies phage tail tube proteins and then becomes an active NADase in Bacillus subtilis. Using a phage mating methodology that promotes genetic exchange between pairs of DSR2-sensitive and DSR2-resistant phages, we further show that some phages express anti-DSR2 proteins that bind and repress DSR2. Finally, we demonstrate that the SIR2 domain serves as an effector NADase in a diverse set of phage defense systems outside the DSR family. Our results establish the general role of SIR2 domains in bacterial immunity against phages.",

    "abstract": "Copper homeostasis mechanisms are essential for microbial adaption to changing copper levels within the host during infection. In the opportunistic fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn), the Cn Cbi1/Bim1 protein is a newly identified copper binding and release protein that is highly induced during copper limitation. Recent studies demonstrated that Cbi1 functions in copper uptake through the Ctr1 copper transporter during copper limitation. However, the mechanism of Cbi1 action is unknown. The fungal cell wall is a dynamic structure primarily composed of carbohydrate polymers, such as chitin and chitosan, polymers known to strongly bind copper ions. We demonstrated that Cbi1 depletion affects cell wall integrity and architecture, connecting copper homeostasis with adaptive changes within the fungal cell wall. The cbi1{Delta} mutant strain possesses an aberrant cell wall gene transcriptional signature as well as defects in chitin and chitosan deposition. These changes are reflected in altered macrophage activation and changes in the expression of specific virulence-associated phenotypes. Furthermore, using Cn strains defective in chitosan biosynthesis, we demonstrated that cell wall chitosan modulates the ability of the fungal cell to withstand copper stress. In conclusion, our data suggest a dual role for the fungal cell wall, in particular the inner chitin / chitosan layer, in protection against toxic levels of copper and providing a source of metal ion availability during copper starvation. Given the previously described role for Cbi1 in copper uptake, we propose that this copper-binding protein is involved in shuttling copper from the cell wall to the copper transporter Ctr1 for regulated microbial copper uptake.\n\nAuthor summaryMicroorganisms must be equipped to readily acquire essential micro-nutrients like copper from nutritionally poor environments while simultaneously shielding themselves from conditions of metal excess. We explored mechanisms of microbial copper homeostasis in the human opportunistic fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) by defining physiological roles of the newly described copper-binding and release protein Cn Cbi1/Bim1. Highly induced during copper limitation, Cbi1 has been shown to interact with the high-affinity copper transporter Ctr1. We defined Cbi1-regulated changes in the fungal cell wall, including controlling levels of the structural carbohydrates chitin and chitosan. These polysaccharides are embedded deeply in the cell wall and are known to avidly bind copper. We also defined the host immunological alterations in response to these cell wall changes. Our data suggest a model in which the fungal cell wall, especially the chito-oligomer layer, serves as a copper-binding structure to shield the cell from states of excess copper, while also serving as a copper storage site during conditions of extracellular copper depletion. Given its ability to bind and release copper, the Cbi1 protein likely shuttles copper from the cell wall to copper transporters for regulated copper acquisition.",

    "abstract": "1.Adaptive evolution has the power to illuminate genetic mechanisms under a pre-defined set of selection factors in a controlled environment. Laboratory evolution of bacteria under long-term starvation has gained importance in recent years because of its ability to uncover adaptive strategies to overcome prolonged nutrient limitation- a condition thought to be encountered often by natural microbial isolates. In this evolutionary paradigm, bacteria are maintained in an energy-restricted environment in the growth phase called as long-term stationary phase or LTSP. This phase is characterized by a stable viable population size and highly dynamic genetic changes. Multiple independent iterations of LTSP evolution experiments have given rise to mutants that are slow-growing compared to the ancestor. Although the antagonistic regulation between rapid growth and stress response is fairly well-known in bacteria (especially Escherichia coli), the reason behind the growth deficit of many LTSP-adapted mutants has not been explored in detail. In this review, I revisit the trade-off between growth and stress response and delve into the regulatory mechanisms currently known to control growth under nutrient deficiency. Focusing on the theme of \"sigma-factor competition\" I try to search for the evolutionary reasoning of slow growth amongst mutants adapted to prolonged starvation. Additionally, I present novel experimental data indicating the dynamics of four such slow-growing variants that evolved during a 30-day long LTSP evolution experiment with Escherichia coli.",

Among all SARS proteins, the ORF8 protein from SARS-2 virus is significantly different from other known SARS-like coronaviruses, and therefore could exhibit unique pathogenic properties. We assess if ORF8 protein bears super antigenic features using in silico tools. We show that ORF8 has properties of an extracellular soluble protein and shares a significant degree of amino acid sequence identity with toxic shock syndrome toxin. Besides, docking and binding affinity analyses between monomeric and homodimeric ORF-8 with V{beta} 2.1 and TRBV11-2 reveal strong interaction and high binding affinity. ORF8-TRBV11-2 strong interaction can contribute to the observed clonal expansion of that chain during COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome.

    "abstract": "Citrobacter rodentium is an attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogen used as a model for enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infections in mice. While in the host, C. rodentium must adapt to stresses in the gastrointestinal tract such as antimicrobial peptides, pH changes, and bile salts. The Cpx envelope stress response (ESR) is a two-component system used by some bacteria to remediate stress by modulating gene expression and is necessary for C. rodentium pathogenesis in mice. To investigate genes in the Cpx regulon that may contribute to C. rodentium pathogenesis, RNA-Seq, SILAC, and microarray data from previous research was mined and the genes yebE, ygiB, bssR, and htpX were confirmed to be strongly upregulated by the presence of CpxRA using lux reporter constructs. To determine the function of these genes in vivo, knockout mutants were tested in C57Bl/6J and C3H/HeJ mice. Although none of the mutants exhibited marked virulence phenotypes, the {Delta}cpxRA mutant had reduced colonization and attenuated virulence, as previously determined. We also found that the absence of the Cpx ESR resulted in higher expression of the LEE master regulator, ler. In addition, we determined that the {Delta}cpxRA mutant had a growth defect in medium simulating the colon, as did several of the mutants bearing deletions in Cpx-upregulated genes. Overall, these results indicate that the {Delta}cpxRA virulence defect is not due to any single Cpx regulon gene examined. Instead, attenuation may be the result of defective growth in the colonic environment resulting from the collective impact of multiple Cpx-regulated genes.",

    "abstract": "Campylobacter jejuni is the most incriminated pathogen in bacterial gastroenteritis, and therefore, characteristics of its epidemiology must be continuously investigated to support possible mitigating measures. This is particularly important when evaluating representative strains of the worlds leading chicken meat exporter, Brazil. We evaluated a panel of 14 virulence genes in 359 strains of C. jejuni isolated from chilled broiler carcasses of Brazil. The genes were classified into five virulence categories (B: biofilm/motility; SS: secretion/cytotoxicity system; CI: invasion/colonization; GB: Guillain-Barre and AE: adaptation to stress). The percentage of strains with stress adaptation genes (86.07%) indicates the potential to adapt to unfavorable environmental conditions and hcp gene in 97.77%, indicates the ability to cause serious infections in humans. Genes related to GBS in 77.44% of strains are an additional concern, which must be monitored. The gene panel showed the presence of 124 virulence profiles. Individual analyzes by carcass, slaughter establishment, and municipalities where they were located showed high I.Var., of 0.82, 0.87 and 0.78, respectively. Georeferencing indicated state A as a hotspot for virulent strains. Higher levels of isolation and multi-virulence were identified in the summer, which in Brazil is hot and humid. Proteomics was able to discriminate the strains, but due to the high heterogeneity between them, it did not allow to explain their dissemination. Together, our results showed that the studied strains are a potential danger to public health and that there is an urgent need for their surveillance and the adoption of control measures, especially in state A.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYCampylobacter jejuni is a bacterium considered one of the main causes of foodborne illnesses and the consumption of undercooked chicken meat is one of the main sources of human infection. In Brazil, epidemiological studies of this pathogen are still scarce, when compared to countries with structured surveillance, as well as, its analysis is not required by public health agencies in any group of foods intended for human consumption. Here we investigate the epidemiology of C. jejuni strains isolated from chilled chicken carcasses in Brazil, determining virulent and multivirulent strains, by the origin of the sample and its phenotypic patterns. The strains showed a high potential for adaptation to the environment, being classified as virulent and multivirulent, with a seasonal pattern in the hottest and humid periods of the year. In state A, the strains with the highest evolutionary level were isolated, when compared to the other states in the region. We hope that this study will help to better understand the potential risks that C. jejuni poses to the population and support surveillance agencies in tracking and adopting measures to minimize the dangers that this pathogen poses to public health.",

    "abstract": "All organisms rely on complex metabolites such as amino acids, nucleotides, and cofactors for essential metabolic processes. Some microbes synthesize these fundamental ingredients of life de novo, while others rely on uptake to fulfill their metabolic needs. Although certain metabolic processes are inherently  leaky, the mechanisms enabling stable metabolite provisioning among microbes in the absence of a host remain largely unclear. In particular, how can metabolite provisioning among free-living bacteria be maintained under the evolutionary pressure to economize resources? Salvaging, the process of  recycling and reusing, can be a metabolically efficient route to obtain access to required resources. Here, we show experimentally how precursor salvaging in engineered Escherichia coli populations can lead to stable, long-term metabolite provisioning. We find that salvaged cobamides (vitamin B12 and related enzyme cofactors) are readily made available to non-productive population members, yet salvagers are strongly protected from overexploitation due to partial metabolite privatization. We also describe a previously unnoted benefit of precursor salvaging, namely the removal of the non-functional, proliferation-inhibiting precursor. As long as compatible precursors are present, any microbe possessing the terminal steps of a biosynthetic process can, in principle, forgo de novo biosynthesis in favor of salvaging. Consequently, precursor salvaging likely represents a potent, yet overlooked, alternative to de novo biosynthesis for the acquisition and provisioning of metabolites in free-living bacterial populations.",

The so-called long Agos are composed of four major domains (N, PAZ, MID, and PIWI) and contribute to RNA silencing in eukaryotes (eAgos) or defence against invading mobile genetic elements in prokaryotes (pAgos). The majority (~60%) of pAgos identified bioinformatically are shorter (comprised of only MID and PIWI domains) and are typically associated with Sir2, Mrr or TIR domain-containing proteins. The cellular function and mechanism of short pAgos remain enigmatic. Here, we show that Geobacter sulfurreducens short pAgo and the NAD+-bound Sir2-protein form a stable heterodimeric complex. The GsSir2/Ago complex presumably recognizes invading plasmid or phage DNA and activates the Sir2 subunit, which triggers endogenous NAD+ depletion and cell death, and prevents the propagation of invading DNA. We reconstituted NAD+ depletion activity in vitro and showed that activated GsSir2/Ago complex functions as a NADase that hydrolyses NAD+ to ADPR. Thus, short Sir2-associated pAgos provide defence against phages and plasmids and underscores the diversity of mechanisms of prokaryotic Agos.",

Despite its importance, models of the process remain speculative. Here we apply cryogenic electron tomography to image the nanoscale architecture of mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. We find that constriction of the inner and outer membranes is coordinated, suggesting that force on both membranes is applied externally. While we observe ER at constriction sites, it did not encircle constrictions. Instead, we find long bundles of both unbranched actin and septin filaments enriched at constrictions. Actin bundles align with the central region of division bridges and septin bundles with the necks on either side. Septin bundles appear to guide microtubules to constriction sites, suggesting, along with autolysosomes observed in the vicinity, a pathway for mitophagy. Together, our results rule out several existing models for mitochondrial fission and provide empirical parameters to inform the development of realistic coarse-grained models in the future.",

    "abstract": "Fission yeast cytokinesis is driven by simultaneous septum synthesis, membrane furrowing and actomyosin ring constriction. The septum consists of a primary septum flanked by secondary septa. First, delivery of the glucan synthase Bgs1 and membrane vesicles initiate primary septum synthesis and furrowing. Next, Bgs4 is delivered for secondary septum formation. It is unclear how septum synthesis is coordinated with membrane furrowing. Cdc42 promotes delivery of Bgs1 but not Bgs4. We find that after primary septum initiation, Cdc42 inactivators Rga4 and Rga6 localize to the division site. In rga4{Delta}rga6{Delta} mutants Cdc42 activity is enhanced during late cytokinesis and cells take longer to separate. Electron micrographs of the division site in these mutants exhibit malformed septum with irregular membrane structures. These mutants have a larger division plane with enhanced Bgs1 delivery but fail to enhance accumulation of Bgs4 and several exocytic proteins. Additionally, these mutants show endocytic defects at the division site. This suggests that Cdc42 regulates only specific membrane trafficking events. Our data indicate that while active Cdc42 promotes primary septum synthesis, as cytokinesis progresses Rga4 and Rga6 localize to the division site to decrease Cdc42 activity. This couples specific membrane trafficking events with septum formation to allow proper septum morphology.\n\nAbstract Figure\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=160 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/472679v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ef042aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fa81adorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@157a4a5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fa516d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG SynopsisThe GTPase Cdc42 regulates cytokinesis in cell-walled fission yeast.

Mutants lacking Cdc42 inactivators, Rga4 and Rga6, lead to membrane trafficking defects and malformed septa consequently delaying cell separation.",

    "abstract": "Soil microbial diversity affects ecosystem functioning and global biogeochemical cycles. Soil bacterial communities catalyze a diversity of biogeochemical reactions and have thus sparked considerable scientific interest. One driver of bacterial community dynamics in natural ecosystems has so far been largely neglected: the predator-prey interactions between bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) and bacteria. To generate ground level knowledge on environmental drivers of these particular predator-prey dynamics we propose an activity-based ecological framework to simultaneous capture community dynamics of bacteria and bacteriophages in soils. An ecological framework and specifically the analyses of community dynamics across latitudinal and altitudinal gradients have been widely used in ecology to understand community-wide responses of innumerable taxa to environmental change, in particular to climate. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the activity of bacteria and bacteriophages co-decline across an elevational gradient. We used metatranscriptomics to investigate bacterial and bacteriophage activity patterns at 5 sites across 400 elevational meters in the Swiss Alps in 2015 and 2017. We found that metabolic activity (transcription levels) of bacteria declined significantly with increasing elevation, but activity of bacteriophages did not. We showed that bacteriophages are consistently active in soil along the entire gradient. Bacteriophage activity pattern, however, is divergent from that of their putative bacterial prey. Future efforts will be necessary to link the environment-activity relationship to predator-prey dynamics, to understand the magnitude of viral contributions to mobilize bacterial cell carbon when infection causes bacterial cell death, a process that may represent an overlooked component of soil biogeochemical cycles.",

    "abstract": "Hormones coordinate long-range cell-cell communication in multicellular organisms and play vital roles in normal physiology, metabolism, and health. Using the newly-completed organism-wide single cell transcriptional atlas of a non-human primate, the mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), we have systematically identified hormone-producing and -target cells for 87 classes of hormones, and have created a browsable atlas for hormone signaling that reveals previously unreported sites of hormone regulation and species-specific rewiring. Hormone ligands and receptors exhibited cell-type-dependent, stereotypical expression patterns, and their transcriptional profiles faithfully classified the discrete cell types defined by the full transcriptome, despite their comprising less than 1% of the transcriptome. Although individual cell types generally exhibited the same characteristic patterns of hormonal gene expression, a number of examples of similar or seemingly-identical cell types (e.g., endothelial cells of the lung versus of other organs) displayed different hormonal gene expression patterns. By linking ligand-expressing cells to the cells expressing the corresponding receptor, we constructed an organism-wide map of the hormonal cell-cell communication network. The hormonal cell-cell network was remarkably densely and robustly connected, and included classical hierarchical circuits (e.g. pituitary [-&gt;] peripheral endocrine gland [-&gt;] diverse cell types) as well as examples of highly distributed control. The network also included both well-known examples of feedback loops and a long list of potential novel feedback circuits. This primate hormone atlas provides a powerful resource to facilitate discovery of regulation on an organism-wide scale and at single-cell resolution, complementing the single-site-focused strategy of classical endocrine studies. The network nature of hormone regulation and the principles discovered here further emphasize the importance of a systems approach to understanding hormone regulation.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian prions are lethal infectious agents that propagate as distinct strains and are composed of multichain assemblies of misfolded host-encoded prion protein (PrP), often referred to as prion rods. The structural features that define infectious prion rods and the molecular determinants of prion strain diversity are poorly understood. Here, we present a near-atomic resolution cryo-EM structure of PrP fibrils present in highly infectious prion rod preparations isolated from the brains of RML prion-infected mice. We found that prion rods comprise single-protofilament helical amyloid fibrils that coexist with twisted pairs of the same protofilaments. Each rung of the protofilament is formed by a single PrP monomer with the ordered core comprising PrP residues 94-225, which folds to create two asymmetric lobes with the N-linked glycans and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor projecting from the C-terminal lobe. The overall architecture is comparable to that of recently reported PrP fibrils isolated from the brain of hamsters infected with the 263K prion strain. However, there are marked conformational variations that could result from differences in PrP primary sequence and/or represent distinguishing features of the distinct prion strains. These conformational changes impact the overall geometry of the fibrils and may also impact fibril pairing, one or both of which may critically influence PrP glycoform selection that occurs during strain-specific prion propagation.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play a vital role in biological processes that rely on transient molecular compartmentation1. In T cells, the dynamic switching between migration and adhesion mandates a high degree of plasticity in the interplay of adhesion and signaling molecules with the actin cytoskeleton2,3. Here, we show that the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of adhesion- and degranulation-promoting adapter protein (ADAP) acts as a multipronged scaffold for G- and F-actin, thereby promoting actin polymerization and bundling. Positively charged motifs, along a sequence of at least 200 amino acids, interact with both longitudinal sides of G-actin in a promiscuous manner. These polymorphic interactions with ADAP become constrained to one side once F-actin is formed. Actin polymerization by ADAP acts in synergy with a capping protein but competes with cofilin. In T cells, ablation of ADAP impairs adhesion and migration with a time-dependent reduction of the F-actin content in response to chemokine or T cell receptor (TCR) engagement. Our data suggest that IDR-assisted molecular crowding of actin above the critical concentration defines a new mechanism to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics. The principle of IDRs serving as molecular sponges to facilitate regulated self-assembly of filament-forming proteins might be a general phenomenon.",

Independent determination of the protein structure by both HR-HRPF-based modeling and heteronuclear NMR was carried out, with results compared only after both processes were complete. The HR-HRPF-based model was highly similar to the lowest energy NMR model, with a backbone RMSD of 1.6 [A].

    "abstract": "Dengue NS2B-NS3 protease existing in equilibrium between the active and inactive forms is essential for virus replication, thus representing a key drug target. Here Myricetin, a plant flavonoid, was characterized to non-competitively inhibit Dengue protease. Further NMR study identified the protease residues perturbed by binding to Myricetin, which were utilized to construct the Myricetin-protease complexes. Strikingly, in the active form Myricetin binds a new allosteric site (AS2) far away from the active site pocket and allosteric site (AS1) for binding Curcumin, while in the inactive form it binds both AS1 and AS2. To decipher the mechanism for the allosteric inhibition by Myricetin, we conducted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on different forms of Dengue NS2B-NS3 protease. Unexpectedly, the binding of Myricetin to AS2 is sufficient to disrupt the active conformation by displacing the characteristic NS2B C-terminal {beta}- hairpin from the active site pocket. By contrast, the binding of Myricetin to AS1 and AS2 results in locking the inactive conformation. Therefore Myricetin represents the first small molecule which allosterically inhibits Dengue protease by both disrupting the active conformation and locking the inactive conformation. The results enforce the notion that a global allosteric network exists in Dengue NS2B-NS3 protease, which is susceptible to allosteric inhibition by small molecules such as Myricetin and Curcumin. As Myricetin has been extensively used as a food additive, it might be directly utilized to fight the Dengue infections and as a promising starting for further design of potent allosteric inhibitors.\n\nGraphic Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=117 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/472523v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ec52d1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1313dc4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ce40b5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fa6051_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Amyloid forming proteins are involved in many pathologies and often belong to the class of intrinsically disordered proteins. One of these proteins is the islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), which is the main constituent of the amyloid fibrils found in the pancreas of type 2 diabetes patients. The molecular mechanism of IAPP-induced cell death is not yet understood, however it is known that cell membrane plays a dual role, being a catalyst of IAPP aggregation and the target of IAPP toxicity. Using FTIR spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations we investigate the very first molecular steps following IAPP binding to a lipid membrane. In particular, we assess the combined effects of the charge state of amino-acid residue 18 and the IAPP-membrane interactions on the structures of monomeric and aggregated IAPP. Both our experiments and simulations reveal distinct IAPP-membrane interaction modes for the various IAPP variants. Membrane binding causes IAPP to fold into an amphipathic helix, which in the case of H18K- and H18R-IAPP can easily insert into the membrane. For all IAPP variants but H18E-IAPP, the membrane-bound -helical structure is an intermediate on the way to IAPP amyloid aggregation, while H18E-IAPP remains in a stable helical conformation. The fibrillar aggregates of wild-type IAPP and H18K-IAPP are dominated by an antiparallel {beta}-sheet conformation, while H18R- and H18A-IAPP exhibit both antiparallel and parallel {beta}-sheets as well as amorphous aggregates. In summary, our results emphasize the importance of residue 18 for the structure and membrane interaction of IAPP. This residue is thus a good target for destabilizing amyloid fibrils of IAPP and inhibit its toxic actions by possible therapeutic molecules.",

To date, models harbouring conditional alleles (i.e.: two loxP sites flanking an exon or a critical DNA sequence of interest) remain the most challenging to generate as they require simultaneous cleavage of the genome using two guides in order to properly integrate the repair template. In the current manuscript, we describe a modification of the sequential electroporation procedure described by Horii et al (2017). We demonstrate production of conditional allele mouse models for eight different genes via one of two alternative strategies: either by consecutive sequential electroporation (strategy A) or non-consecutive sequential electroporation (strategy B).\n\nResultsBy using strategy A, we demonstrated successful generation of conditional allele models for three different genes (Icam1, Lox, and Sar1b), with targeting efficiencies varying between 5 to 13%. By using strategy B, we generated five conditional allele models (Loxl1, Pard6a, Pard6g, Clcf1, and Mapkapk5), with targeting efficiencies varying between 3 to 25%.\n\nConclusionOur modified electroporation-based approach, involving one of the two alternative strategies, allowed the production of conditional allele models for eight different genes via two different possible paths. This reproducible method will serve as another reliable approach in addition to other well-established methodologies in the literature for conditional allele mouse model generation.",

    "abstract": "G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest human receptor family and involved in virtually every physiological process. One hallmark of GPCR function is the specific coupling of activated receptors to selected downstream signaling pathways. The ability to tune this coupling would permit the development of receptors with new capabilities. GPCRs and G-proteins have been recently resolved structurally at high resolution, but this information was in only very few cases harnessed for a rational engineering of these protein complexes. Here, we demonstrate the structure-guided optimization of coupling in chimeric light-activated GPCRs (OptoXRs). Our hypothesis was that the incorporation of structural GPCR-G contacts will lead to improved receptor activity. We first evaluated structure-based alignments as complements to existing sequence-based methods for generation of chimeric receptors. We then show in a prototypical light-activated {beta}2AR that inclusion of -helical residues forming structural contacts to G resulted in receptors with 7- to 20-fold increased function compared to other design strategies. In turn, elimination of GPCR-G contacts diminished function. Finally, the efficient receptor design served as a platform for the optimization of a further light-activated receptor and spectral tuning of the photoreceptor core domain. Our work exemplifies how increased OptoXR potency and new functionalities can be achieved through structure-based design towards targeted inputs into cells and cellular networks.",

    "abstract": "In epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cells organized into sheets break away and become motile mesenchymal cells. EMT plays a crucial role in wound healing, embryonic development, and cancer metastasis. Intracellular signaling in response to mechanical, topographic, or chemical stimuli can promote EMT. We present a multiscale model for EMT downstream of the protein YAP, which suppresses the cell-cell adhesion protein E-cadherin and activates the GTPase Rac1 that enhances cell migration. We first propose an ODE model for YAP/Rac1/E-cadherin interactions. The model dynamics are bistable, accounting for motile loose cells as for adherent slower cells. We implement this model in a cellular Potts model simulation of 2D wound-healing using the open source platform Morpheus. We show that, under suitable stimuli (depicting topographic cues) the sheet exhibits finger-like projections and EMT. Morphological, as well as quantitative differences in YAP levels as well as cell speed across the sheet are consistent with preexisting experimental observations of epithelial sheets grown on topographic features in vitro. The simulation is also consistent with experiments that knockdown or over-express YAP, inhibit Rac1, or block E-cadherin.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEIn normal wound-healing, cell in an epithelium divide, grow, and migrate so as to seal a gap. In some pathological states, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) can lead to abnormal morphology, including fingering, breakage of single cells or multicellular clusters from the sheet edge. The mechanochemical control of this behaviour by cell signaling circuits (YAP, Rac1, and E-cadherin) reveals how the competition between cell adhesion and cell migration contributes to the process. We use the open-source computational platform Morpheus to investigate a multiscale model for the interactions of the proteins inside cells and the resulting morphology of the cell sheet. Results are consistent with experimental results in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Patterning of the anterior-posterior axis is fundamental to animal development. The Wnt pathway plays a major role in this process by activating the expression of posterior genes in animals from worms to humans. This observation raises the question of whether the Wnt pathway or other regulators control the expression of the many anterior-expressed genes. We found that the expression of five anterior-specific genes in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos depends on the Wnt pathway effectors pop-1/TCF and sys-1/{beta}-catenin. We focused further on one of these anterior genes, ref-2/ZIC, a conserved transcription factor expressed in multiple anterior lineages. Live imaging of ref-2 mutant embryos identified defects in cell division timing and position in anterior lineages. Cis-regulatory dissection identified three ref-2 transcriptional enhancers, one of which is necessary and sufficient for anterior-specific expression. This enhancer is activated by the T-box transcription factors TBX-37 and TBX-38, and surprisingly, concatemerized TBX-37/38 binding sites are sufficient to drive anterior-biased expression alone, despite the broad expression of TBX-37 and TBX-38. Taken together, our results highlight the diverse mechanisms used to regulate anterior expression patterns in the embryo.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=175 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/472681v6_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@412c25org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b944c2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1511cedorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@420d4e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Patterning of the anterior-posterior axis is fundamental to animal development. The Wnt pathway plays a major role in this process by activating the expression of posterior genes in animals from worms to humans. This observation raises the question of whether the Wnt pathway or other regulators control the expression of the many anterior-expressed genes. We found that the expression of five anterior-specific genes in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos depends on the Wnt pathway effectors pop-1/TCF and sys-1/{beta}-catenin. We focused further on one of these anterior genes, ref-2/ZIC, a conserved transcription factor expressed in multiple anterior lineages. Live imaging of ref-2 mutant embryos identified defects in cell division timing and position in anterior lineages. Cis-regulatory dissection identified three ref-2 transcriptional enhancers, one of which is necessary and sufficient for anterior-specific expression. This enhancer is activated by the T-box transcription factors TBX-37 and TBX-38, and surprisingly, concatemerized TBX-37/38 binding sites are sufficient to drive anterior-biased expression alone, despite the broad expression of TBX-37 and TBX-38. Taken together, our results highlight the diverse mechanisms used to regulate anterior expression patterns in the embryo.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=175 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/472681v6_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@412c25org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b944c2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1511cedorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@420d4e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) harbors proteins that traverse the membrane via several helical segments, so-called multi-span proteins. Two contradicting mechanisms were suggested to describe their integration into the MOM. The first proposes that the mitochondrial import (MIM) complex facilitates this process and functions as an insertase, whereas the second suggests that such proteins can integrate into the lipid phase without the assistance of import factors in a process that is enhanced by phosphatidic acid. To resolve this discrepancy and obtain new insights on the biogenesis of these proteins, we addressed this issue using yeast mitochondria and the multi-span protein Om14. Testing different truncation variants, we show that only the full-length protein contains all the required information that assure targeting specificity. Employing a specific insertion assay and several single and double deletion strains, we show that neither the import receptor Tom70 nor any other protein with a cytosolically exposed domain have a crucial contribution to the biogenesis process. We further demonstrate that Mim1 and Porin are required for optimal membrane integration of Om14 but none of them is absolutely required. Unfolding of the newly synthesized protein, its optimal hydrophobicity, as well as higher fluidity of the membrane dramatically enhanced the import capacity of Om14. Collectively, our findings suggest that MOM multi-span proteins can follow different biogenesis pathways in which proteinaceous elements and membrane behavior contribute to a variable extent to the combined efficiency.\n\nSummaryZhou et al. provide new insights to the biogenesis of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. They demonstrate that such proteins can follow various routes where both proteinaceous elements and membrane behavior regulate the efficiency and specificity of this process.",

    "abstract": "tRNA fragments (tRFs) are small RNAs comparable to the size and function of miRNAs. tRFs are generally Dicer independent, are found associated with Ago, and can repress expression of genes post-transcriptionally. Given that this expands the repertoire of small RNAs capable of post-transcriptional gene expression, it is important to predict tRF targets with confidence. Some attempts have been made to predict tRF targets, but are limited in the scope of tRF classes used in prediction or limited in feature selection. We hypothesized that established miRNA target prediction features applied to tRFs through a random forest machine learning algorithm will immensely improve tRF target prediction. Using this approach, we show significant improvements in tRF target prediction for all classes of tRFs and validate our predictions in two independent cell lines. Finally, Gene Ontology analysis suggests that among the tRFs conserved between mice and humans, the predicted targets are enriched significantly in neuronal function, and we show this specifically for tRF-3009a. These improvements to tRF target prediction further our understanding of tRF function broadly across species and provide avenues for testing novel roles for tRFs in biology. We have created a publicly available website for the targets of tRFs predicted by tRForest.",

According to the recent WHO reports, African regions share 95% of the total deaths worldwide that occurs due to malaria. Plasmodium falciparum M17 Leucyl Aminopeptidase (PfM17LAP) plays an important role in the regulation of amino acids release and for the survival of the parasite. We performed molecular docking and simulation studies to find the potential inhibitors against PfM17LAP using ChEMBL antimalarial library. Molecular docking studies and post-docking analysis revealed that molecules CHEMBL369831 and CHEMBL176888 showed better binding than the reference molecule BESTATIN. LibDock and X-SCORES of molecules BES, CHEMBL369831 and CHEMBL176888 are 130.071, 230.38, 223.56 and -8.75 Kcal/mol, -10.90 Kcal/mol, -11.05 Kcal/mol respectively. ADMET profiling of the top ten ranked molecules was done by using the Discovery Studio. Molecular dynamic studies revealed that the complex PfM17LAP-CHEMBL369831 is stable throughout the simulation.

    "abstract": "Several proteins which are responsible for neuro-degenrerative disorders (Alzheimers, Parkinsons etc) are shown to undergo a mechanism known as liquid liquid phase separation (LLPS). We in this research build a predictor which would answer whether a protein molecule would undergo LLPS or not. For this we used some protein sequences for which we already knew the answer. The ones who undergo LLPS were considered as the positive set and the ones who do not, were taken as the negative set. Depending on the knowledge of amino-acid sequences we identified some relevant variables in the context of LLPS e.g. number of amino acids, length of the best pairings, average register shifts. Using these variables we built a number of scoring functions which were basically analytic functions involving these variables and we also combined some scores already existing in the literature. We considered a total of 43636 protein sequences, among them only 121 were positive. We applied logistic regression and performed cross validation, where 25% of the data were used as the training set and the performance of the obtained results were tested on the remaining 75% of the data. In the training process, we used Simplex algorithm to maximize area under the curve (AUC) in receiver operator characteristics (ROC) space for each of the scores we defined. The optimised parameters were then used to evaluate AUC on the test set to check the accuracy. The best performing score was identified as the predicting model to answer the question whether a protein chain would undergo phase separating behavior or not.\n\nAuthor summaryLiquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a classic subject in polymer physics. The essen- tial physics is aptly captured within the Flory-Huggins (FH) approach, a simple lattice mean-field theory. Evidence has been mounting in the last decade that protein LLPS underlies the formation of membrane-less organelles (MLOs) in living cells, explaining why proteins and other bio-molecules can remain in a dense liquid condensate without diffusing away. Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), with a sequence-intrinsic prefer- ence for conformational heterogeneity or disorder under native conditions, are enriched in proteins that have the ability of switching on LLPS. The detailed understanding of the biological function of disordered bio-molecular condensates, whose formation is driven by LLPS, is currently the focus of a major effort in cell biology. Several key proteins in neuro-degenerative disorders are components of MLOs, and a further liquid-to-solid transition to unsoluble amyloid aggregates may be triggered by pathogenic mutants. Non-equilibrium active processes are also known to drive non trivial spatio-temporal organization patterns in MLOs. In this research we aim to predict which proteins can undergo LLPS in physiological conditions in living cells, and the corresponding phase behavior, based on theoretical tools and on the knowledge of the amino-acid sequence alone. We derive specific knowledge-based potentials for the different kind of short-range interactions that are believed to drive protein LLPS and use them to build a simple yes/no predictor of phase separation in physiological conditions.",

    "abstract": "The genome is organized by diverse packaging mechanisms like nucleosome formation, loop extrusion and phase separation, which all compact DNA in a dynamic manner. Phase separation additionally drives protein recruitment to condensed DNA sites and thus regulates gene transcription. The cohesin complex is a key player in chromosomal organization that extrudes loops to connect distant regions of the genome and ensures sister chromatid cohesion after S-phase. For stable loading onto the DNA and for activation, cohesin requires the loading complex Scc2/4. As the precise loading mechanism remains unclear, we investigated whether phase separation might be the initializer of the cohesin recruitment process. We found that, in absence of cohesin, budding yeast Scc2/4 forms phase separated co-condensates with DNA, which comprise liquid-like properties shown by droplet shape, fusion ability and reversibility. We reveal in DNA curtain and optical tweezer experiments that these condensates are built by DNA bridging and bending through Scc2/4. Importantly, Scc2/4-mediated condensates recruit cohesin efficiently and increase the stability of the cohesin complex. We conclude that phase separation properties of Scc2/4 enhance cohesin loading by molecular crowding, which might then provide a starting point for the recruitment of additional factors and proteins.",

    "abstract": "It is becoming apparent that translational regulation involves the coordinated actions of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and non-coding RNAs. For efficient translation, mRNA needs to be circularized, which is catalyzed by RNA binding proteins and translation factors. However, the role of lncRNAs in the process is not yet defined. We first performed RNA-seq and RNA- immunoprecipitation coupled-Seq and identified LSAMP-3 and Flii-1. Moreover, modeling studies suggest enhanced kissing loop interactions including of transcripts that encode angiogenesis and epithelial mesenchymal transition. While intestinal epithelial cell specific RBM3 transgenic mice showed increased LSAMP-3 and Flii-1, this was reduced in knockout mice. Also, RBM3 overexpression increased tumor xenograft growth, this was suppressed by knockdown of the lncRNAs. Also, knockdown of endogenous RBM3 reduced lncRNA levels and tumor xenograft growth. In addition, it reduced colitis-associated cancers. We propose that RBPs such as RBM3 mediate their function through regulatory lncRNAs that enable circularization to control translation.",

We examined their impact at the RNA and protein level, including their ability to maintain stability of microsatellite sequences and instigate a DNA damage response. We calibrated these assays by testing well-established pathogenic and benign control variants.\n\nRESULTSFive VUS resulted in functionally abnormal protein, 15 VUS resulted in functionally normal protein, and one VUS showed mixed results. Furthermore, we converted the functional outputs into a single odds in favor of pathogenicity score for each VUS.\n\nCONCLUSIONOur CRISPR-based functional assay successfully models phenotypes observed in patients in a cellular context. Using this approach, we generated evidence for or against pathogenicity for utilization by variant classification expert panels.

    "abstract": "5-carboxycytosine (5caC) is a rare epigenetic modification found in nucleic acids of all domains of life. Despite its sparse genomic abundance, 5caC is presumed to play essential regulatory roles in transcription, maintenance and baseexcision processes in DNA. In this work, we utilize nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to address the effects of 5caC incorporation into canonical DNA strands at multiple pH and temperature conditions. Our results demonstrate that 5caC has a pH-dependent global destabilizing and a base-pair mobility enhancing local impact on dsDNA, albeit without any detectable influence on the ground-state B-DNA structure. Measurement of hybridization thermodynamics and kinetics of 5caC-bearing DNA duplexes highlighted how acidic environment (pH 5.8 and 4.7) destabilizes the double-stranded structure by ~10-20 kJ mol-1 at 37 {degrees}C when compared to the same sample at neutral pH. Protonation of 5caC results in a lower activation energy for the dissociation process and a higher barrier for annealing. Studies on conformational exchange on the s time scale regime revealed a sharply localized base-pair motion involving exclusively the modified site and its immediate surroundings. By direct comparison with canonical and 5-formylcytosine (5fC)-edited strands, we were able to address the impact of the two most oxidized naturally occurring cytosine derivatives in the genome. These insights on 5caCs subtle sensitivity to acidic pH contribute to the long standing questions of its capacity as a substrate in base excision repair processes and its purpose as an independent, stable epigenetic mark.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis legalization in North America has coincided with an increase in reports of cannabis-induced toxicosis in pets, but the magnitude of this problem, as well as outcomes of these incidents remain unknown. Therefore, we examined the frequency, diagnostic criteria, clinical signs, and prognoses of cannabis toxicoses in pets in North America. We conducted an online survey between January, 2021 and April, 2021 targeting veterinarians practicing in Canada and the United States (US). Out of the 251 study participants, 191 practiced in Canada. Cannabis toxicosis was most commonly reported in dogs (n=226 veterinarians), and the number of toxicosis cases increased significantly in Canada (p<0.0001) and the US (p=0.002) after October, 2018. Frequently reported clinical signs of cannabis toxicosis included: urinary incontinence (n=195), disorientation (n=182), ataxia (n=178), lethargy (n=150), hyperesthesia (n=134), and bradycardia (n=112). Edibles were most commonly suspected to be the cause of toxicosis (n=116). The most common route of exposure was ingestion (n=135), while the most cited reason was ingestion while unattended (n=135). Cannabis toxicosis was mostly diagnosed using supportive clinical signs (n=229), the most common treatment was outpatient monitoring (n=182), and pets were most often treated as out-patients (n=103). The legalization of cannabis use in Canada and the US is likely an important factor associated with the increased cannabis toxicosis cases in pets; however, the legal status may also increase reporting. The medicinal use of cannabis by pet-owners for pets may also contribute to a portion of the reported toxicoses. Most pets that experienced cannabis toxicosis recovered completely, suggesting that most cannabis toxicoses do not result in long-term ill effects. Even though some deaths (n=16) were reported in association with cannabis toxicosis, the presence of confounders such as toxins, and underlying conditions cannot be ruled out, emphasizing the need for rigorous controlled laboratory studies to investigate this important issue.",

    "abstract": "Harnessing the plant microbiome has the potential to improve agricultural yields and protect plants against pathogens and/or abiotic stresses, while also relieving economic and environmental costs of crop production. While previous studies have gained valuable insights into the underlying genetics facilitating plant-fungal interactions, these have largely been skewed towards certain fungal clades (e.g. arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi). Several different phyla of fungi have been shown to positively impact plant growth rates, including Mortierellaceae fungi. However, the extent of the plant growth promotion (PGP) phenotype(s), their underlying mechanism(s), and the impact of bacterial endosymbionts on fungal-plant interactions remain poorly understood for Mortierellaceae. In this study, we focused on the symbiosis between soil fungus Linnemannia elongata (Mortierellaceae) and Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae), as both organisms have high-quality reference genomes and transcriptomes available, and their lifestyles and growth requirements are conducive to research conditions. Further, L. elongata can host bacterial endosymbionts related to Mollicutes and Burkholderia. The role of these endobacteria on facilitating fungal-plant associations, including potentially further promoting plant growth, remains completely unexplored. We measured Arabidopsis aerial growth at early and late life stages, seed production, and used mRNA sequencing to characterize differentially expressed plant genes in response to fungal inoculation with and without bacterial endosymbionts. We found that L. elongata improved aerial plant growth, seed mass and altered the plant transcriptome, including the upregulation of genes involved in plant hormones and \"response to oxidative stress\", \"defense response to bacterium\", and \"defense response to fungus\". Furthermore, the expression of genes in certain phytohormone biosynthetic pathways were found to be modified in plants treated with L. elongata. Notably, the presence of Mollicutes- or Burkholderia-related endosymbionts in Linnemannia did not impact the expression of genes in Arabidopsis or overall growth rates.",

    "abstract": "Land snails are found to be an appropriate sentinel organism, and the biomarkers chosen are effective for terrestrial heavy metal biomonitoring. The study aimed to compare the biological, biochemistry, and histology of two land snails in the Ismailia governorate, Egypt during different seasons. Random snails were collected from January 2015 to December 2015 from two sites in the Ismailia Governorate, on wet days during each seasons middle month. Soft tissues were taken from the dissected snails. It was noticed that most of the morphometric parameters measured shell height (ShH), last whorl width (LWW), maximum diameter (MaxD), aperture height (AH), and aperture width (AW) were higher in Eobania vermiculata (Sp. 1) than those measured in Monacha obstructa (Sp. 2), except for shell height measurement, which was the same in both species. The growth rate of Sp. 1 and Sp. 2 changed seasonally. In the more polluted areas with heavy metals, lipid peroxidation (LPO) was higher in snails and total protein content than in the snails collected from the less polluted areas for all seasons. However, the snails displayed lower levels of glutathione (GSH) as compared to snails at a less polluted site. GSH and LPO levels, on the other hand, have a negative relationship between them. Histopathological alterations in the digestive gland were more obvious in the general architecture of the digestive gland that had lost its tubular appearance. The excretory cells showed an increase in their excretory granules number and size while calcium cells decreased. Also, gonad follicles have lost their normal architecture with the degeneration of some stages of spermatogenesis and oogenesis. In conclusion, There was a strong correlation between GSH levels and total protein content in the same soft tissues. GSH and LPO levels, on the other hand, have a negative relationship. The overall results display the usefulness of E. vermiculata and M. obstructa land snails as bioindicator organisms and support the application of this ecotoxicological approach for evaluating the biologic impact of toxins. E. vermiculata is more abundant than M. obstructa. The density, morphometric, biochemical, and histology of E. vermiculata and M. obstructa were different at different seasons.",

    "abstract": "Eusocial species differ in living conditions when compared to solitary species primarily due to the dense living conditions of genetically related individuals. Consequently, these crowded conditions can induce a high rate of pathogen transmission and pathogen susceptibility. To resist an epidemic, individuals rely on sets of behaviors, known as social immunity, to decrease pathogen transmission among nestmates. Alongside social immunity, ants have a pair of secretory metapleural glands (MG), thought to secrete antimicrobial compounds important for antisepsis, that are believed to be transferred among nestmates by social immune behaviors such as grooming. To investigate the effects of social immunity on pathogen resistance, we performed a series of experiments by inoculating acorn ants Temnothorax curvispinosus with a lethal spore concentration of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum. After inoculation ant survival was monitored in two environments: solitary and in groups. Additionally, the MG role in pathogen resistance was evaluated for both solitary and grouped living ants, by sealing the MG prior to inoculations. Individuals within a group environment had a higher survival compared to those in a solitary environment, and individuals with sealed glands had significantly decreased survival than ants with non-sealed-MG in both solitary and social environments. We observed the lowest survival for solitary-sealed-MG individuals. Although sealing the MG reduced survival probability, sealing the MG did not remove the benefits of grouped living. We show here that social living plays a crucial role in pathogen resistance and that the MG has an important role in pathogen resistance of individual T. curvispinosus ants. Although important for an individuals pathogen resistance, our data show that the MG does not play a strong role in social immunity as previously believed. Overall, this study provides insights into mechanisms of social immunity and the role of MG in disease resistance.",

    "abstract": "The speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus) is small cyprinid fish that is widespread in the Western USA. Currently treated as a single species, speckled dace consists of multiple evolutionary lineages that can be recognized as species and subspecies throughout its range. Recognition of taxonomic distinctiveness of speckled dace populations is important for developing conservation strategies. In this study, we collected samples of speckled dace from 38 locations in the American West, with a focus on California. We used RAD sequencing to extract thousands of SNPs across the genome from samples to identify genetic differences among seven California populations informally recognized as speckled dace subspecies: Amargosa, Owens, Long Valley, Lahontan, Klamath, Sacramento, and Santa Ana speckled dace. We performed principal component analysis, admixture analysis, estimated pairwise Fst, and constructed a phylogeny to explore taxonomic relationships among these groups and test if these subspecies warrant formal recognition. Our analyses show that the seven subspecies fit into three major lineages equivalent to species: western (Sacramento-Klamath), Santa Ana, and Lahontan speckled dace. Death Valley speckled dace were determined to be two lineages (Amargosa and Long Valley) within Lahontan speckled dace. Western and Lahontan speckled dace lineages had branches that can be designated as subspecies. These designations fit well with the geologic history of the region which has promoted long isolation of populations. This study highlights the importance of genetic analysis for conservation and management of freshwater fishes.",
