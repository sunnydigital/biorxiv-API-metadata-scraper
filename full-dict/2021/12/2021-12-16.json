    "abstract": "N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and its regulatory components play critical roles in various developmental processes in mammals(1-5). However, the landscape and function of m6A in the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) remain unclear due to limited materials. Here, by developing an ultralow-input MeRIP-seq method, we revealed the dynamics of the m6A RNA methylome during the MZT process in mice. We found that more than 1/3 maternal decay and 2/3 zygotic mRNAs were modified by m6A. Moreover, m6As are highly enriched in the RNA of transposable elements MTA and MERVL, which are highly expressed in oocytes and 2-cell embryos, respectively. Notably, maternal depletion of Kiaa1429, a component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, leads to a reduced abundance of m6A-marked maternal RNAs, including both genes and MTA, in GV oocytes, indicating m6A-dependent regulation of RNA stability in oocytes. Interestingly, when the writers were depleted, some m6A-marked 2-cell specific RNAs, including Zscan4 and MERVL, appeared normal at the 2-cell stage but failed to be decayed at later stages, suggesting that m6A regulates the clearance of these transcripts. Together, our study uncovered that m6As function in context-specific manners during MZT, which ensures the transcriptome stability of oocytes and regulates the stage specificity of zygotic transcripts after fertilization.\n\nOne Sentence Summarym6A RNA methylation stabilizes the maternal RNAs in mouse oocytes and degrades the 2-cell specific RNAs in the cleavage-stage embryos.",

    "abstract": "Network analysis has been used for many years in ecological research to analyze organismal associations, for example in food webs, plant-plant or plant-animal interactions. Although network analysis is widely applied in microbial ecology, only recently has it entered the realms of soil microbial ecology, shown by a rapid rise in studies applying co-occurrence analysis to soil microbial communities. While this application offers great potential for deeper insights into the ecological structure of soil microbial ecosystems, it also brings new challenges related to the specific characteristics of soil datasets and the type of ecological questions that can be addressed. In this Perspectives Paper we assess the challenges of applying network analysis to soil microbial ecology due to the small-scale heterogeneity of the soil environment and the nature of soil microbial datasets. We review the different approaches of network construction that are commonly applied to soil microbial datasets and discuss their features and limitations. Using a test dataset of microbial communities from two depths of a forest soil, we demonstrate how different experimental designs and network constructing algorithms affect the structure of the resulting networks, and how this in turn may influence ecological conclusions. We will also reveal how assumptions of the construction method, methods of preparing the dataset, and definitions of thresholds affect the network structure. Finally, we discuss the particular questions in soil microbial ecology that can be approached by analyzing and interpreting specific network properties. Targeting these network properties in a meaningful way will allow applying this technique not in merely descriptive, but in hypothesis-driven research.",

    "abstract": "Restoration often advocates for the use of local seed in restoration, however increasingly new strategies have been proposed to incorporate diverse sources to maintain evolutionary potential within seed mixes. Increasing seed sources per species within a seed mix should increase genetic variation, however, few empirical studies have evaluated how seed source diversity impacts plant community composition following restoration. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the use of single or multi-source seed mix treatments to plant community diversity following restoration. Using 14 species commonly applied in grassland restoration, we examined plant community diversity following restoration comparing seed mixes with either one or five sources per species across two restoration sites in Minnesota and South Dakota, United States. Following seeding, species establishment and abundance were recorded to calculate plant diversity for each seed mix treatment. There were no major effects of seed mix treatment on community emergence and diversity observed, with the majority of plant establishment reflecting non-seeded species. However, site-specific differences were observed. Heterogeneous land-use history associated with the Minnesota site likely contributed to differences across the restoration treatments. In contrast, community diversity at the South Dakota site was homogeneous across seed mix treatments with changes in plant community influenced solely by early season species establishment. This suggests land-use history irrespective of seed mix treatment influences establishment and persistence, particularly in the first year following restoration. Future monitoring across seasons will be needed to evaluate if community diversity changes in response to seed mix treatment.",

    "abstract": "In the last 10 years, knowledges of wild bees and apoid wasps community dynamics have gained interest in urban ecology focusing on the availability of floral resources in cities. Although understudied, the urban environment impacts the conditions of their nesting sites. Recent observations in the Brussels-Capital Region (Belgium) showed that urban pavements can be a novel nesting opportunity for Hymenoptera ground-nesting species such as wild bees and apoid wasps. Here, using citizen science, we investigated the richness of ground-nesting species living under urban pavements, the preferences of the sidewalk joint size related to ground-nesting species size and for sidewalk type or for soils texture under the pavements on the nesting site selection. A total of 22 species belonging to 10 Hymenoptera families of wild bees and digger wasps with their associated kleptoparasites were identified on 89 sites in Brussels. Sandstone setts or concrete slabs with an unbound joint size around 1 cm were found to be best suitable urban pavements for the ground-nesting species. The soil texture under the pavement was highly sandy among our samples. Finally, we also suggest engineering management guidelines to support bee and wasp species nesting under urban pavement in highly urbanized areas. Such observations pave the way for much research in the field of urban ecology to conceive multifunctional pavement promoting biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "PremiseMany traits covary with environmental gradients to form phenotypic clines. While local adaptation to the environment can generate phenotypic clines, other nonadaptive processes may also. If local adaptation causes phenotypic clines, then the direction of genotypic selection on traits should shift from one end of the cline to the other. Traditionally genotypic selection on non-Gaussian traits like germination rate have been hampered because it is challenging to measure their genetic variance.\n\nMethodsHere we used quantitative genetics and reciprocal transplants to test whether a previously discovered cline in germination rate showed additional signatures of adaptation in the scarlet monkeyflower (Mimulus cardinalis). We measured genotypic and population level covariation between germination rate and early survival, a component of fitness. We developed a novel discrete log-normal model to estimate genetic variance in germination rate.\n\nResultsContrary to our adaptive hypothesis, we found no evidence that genetic variation in germination rate contributed to variation in early survival. Across populations, southern populations in both gardens germinated earlier and survived more.\n\nConclusionsSouthern populations have higher early survival but this is not caused by faster germination. This pattern is consistent with nonadaptive forces driving the phenotypic cline in germination rate, but future work will need to assess whether there is selection at other life stages. This statistical framework should help expand quantitative genetic analyses for other waiting-time traits.",

    "abstract": "Molting is a widespread developmental process in which the external extracellular matrix (ECM), the cuticle, is remodeled to allow for organismal growth and environmental adaptation. Studies in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have identified a diverse set of molting-associated factors including signaling molecules, intracellular trafficking regulators, ECM components, and ECM-modifying enzymes such as matrix metalloproteases. C. elegans NEKL-2 and NEKL-3, two conserved members of the NEK family of protein kinases, are essential for molting and promote the endocytosis of environmental steroid-hormone precursors by the epidermis. Steroids in turn drive the cyclic induction of many genes required for molting. Here we report a novel role for the sole C. elegans ADAM-meltrin metalloprotease family member, ADM-2, as a negative regulator of molting. Whereas loss of adm-2 led to strong suppression of molting defects in partial loss-of-function nekl mutants, overexpression of ADM-2 induced molting defects in wild-type animals. CRISPR genome editing implicated the Zn-binding motif within the metalloprotease domain as critical for mediating the effects of ADM-2 on molting. ADM-2 is expressed in the epidermis, and its trafficking through the endo-lysosomal network was disrupted after NEKL depletion. We also identified the epidermally expressed low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, LRP-1, as a candidate target of ADM-2 regulation. Whereas loss of ADM-2 activity led to the upregulation of LRP-1, ADM-2 overexpression caused a reduction in LRP-1 abundance, suggesting that ADM-2 may function as a sheddase for LRP-1. We propose that loss of adm-2 suppresses molting defects in nekl mutants by eliminating a negative regulator of LRP-1, thereby compensating for defects in the efficiency of LRP-1 and sterol uptake. Our findings emphasize the importance of endocytic trafficking for both the internalization of factors that promote molting and the removal of proteins that would otherwise be deleterious to the molting process.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe molecular and cellular features of molting in nematodes share many similarities with cellular and developmental processes that occur in mammals. This includes the degradation and reorganization of extracellular matrix materials that surround cells, as well as the intracellular machineries that allow cells to communicate and sample their environments. In the current study, we found an unexpected function for a conserved protein that degrades proteins on the external surface of cells. Rather than promoting molting through extracellular matrix reorganization, the ADM-2 protease can inhibit the molting process. This observation can be explained by data showing that ADM-2 negatively regulates LRP-1, a membrane protein that promotes molting by facilitating the uptake of molecular building blocks at the cell surface that are needed for molting-related signaling. Our data provide insights into the mechanisms controlling molting and link several conserved proteins to show how they function together during development.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo study the associations between optic nerve head (ONH) strains under intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation with retinal sensitivity in glaucoma subjects.\n\nDesignClinic based cross-sectional study.\n\nParticipants229 subjects with primary open angle glaucoma (subdivided into 115 high tension glaucoma (HTG) subjects and 114 normal tension glaucoma (NTG) subjects).\n\nMethodsFor one eye of each subject, we imaged the ONH using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) under the following conditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with acute IOP elevation (to approximately 33 mmHg) achieved through ophthalmodynamometry. A 3-dimensional (3D) strain-mapping algorithm was applied to quantify IOP-induced ONH tissue strain (i.e. deformation) in each ONH. Strains in the pre-lamina tissue (PLT)and the retina, the choroid, the sclera and the lamina cribrosa (LC) were associated (using linear regression) with measures of retinal sensitivity from the 24-2 Humphrey visual field test (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA, USA). This was done globally, then locally according to the regionalization scheme of Garway-Heath et al.\n\nMain Outcome MeasuresAssociations between ONH strains and values of retinal sensitivity from visual field testing.\n\nResultsFor HTG subjects, we found that (1) there were significant negative linear associations between ONH strains and retinal sensitivity (p<0.001) (on average, a 1% increase in ONH strains corresponded to a decrease in retinal sensitivity of 1.1 dB), (2) high strain regions co-localized with anatomically-mapped regions of high visual field loss, (3) the strongest negative associations were observed in the superior region and in the PLT. In contrast, for NTG subjects, no significant associations between strains and retinal sensitivity were observed except in the supero-temporal region of the LC.\n\nConclusionWe found significant negative associations between IOP-induced ONH strains and retinal sensitivity in a relatively large glaucoma cohort. Specifically, HTG subjects who experienced higher ONH strains were more likely to exhibit lower retinal sensitivities. Interestingly, this trend was in general less pronounced in NTG subjects, which could suggest a distinct pathophysiology between the two glaucoma subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Genetic screens have been widely used to identify genetic pathways that control specific biological functions. In C. elegans, forward genetic screens rely on the isolation of reproductively active mutants that can self-propagate clonal populations. Since aged individuals are unable to generate clonal populations, screens that target post-reproductive phenotypes, such as longevity, are challenging. In this work, we developed an approach that combines microfluidic technologies and image processing to perform a high-throughput, automated screen for mutants with shortened lifespan using protein aggregation as a marker for aging. We take advantage of microfluidics for maintaining a reproductively-active adult mutagenized population and for performing serial high-throughput analysis and sorting of animals with increased protein aggregation, using fluorescently labeled PAB-1 as a readout. We identified five mutants with increased aggregation levels, of which two exhibited a reduced lifespan. We demonstrate that lifespan mutants can be identified by screening for accelerated protein aggregation through quantitative analysis of fluorescently-labeled aggregates in populations that do not require conditional sterilization or manual separation of parental and progeny populations. We further analyzed the morphology of protein aggregates and reveal that patterns of aggregation in naturally-aging animals differ from mutants with increased aggregation, suggesting aggregate growth is time-dependent. This screening approach can be customized to other non-developmental phenotypes that appear during adulthood, as well as to other aging markers to identify additional longevity-regulating genetic pathways.",

Although SU-8 has been often investigated for a variety of biological applications, how its surface properties influence both the interaction of bacterial cells with the substrate and its colonization is poorly understood. In this work, we tailor SU-8 nanoscale surface properties to investigate single cell motility, adhesion and successive colonization of a phytopathogenic bacteria, Xylella fastidiosa. Different surface properties of SU-8 thin films have been prepared using photolithography processing and oxygen plasma treatment. We found a significant difference in bacterial cell behavior and subsequent colonization on SU-8 as surface property changes. A larger density of carboxyl groups in hydrophilic plasma-treated SU-8 surfaces promotes faster cell motility in the earlier stage of the growth. The hydrophobic nature of pristine SU-8 surfaces has no trackable bacterial motility with 5 to 10 times more single cells adhered to surface than its plasma-treated counterpart. In fact, plasma-treated SU-8 samples suppressed bacterial adhesion, with surfaces showing less than 5% coverage. These results not only showcase that SU-8 surface properties can impact the bacterial behavior in a spatiotemporal manner, but also provide insights on the prominent ability of pathogens to evolve and adapt to different surface properties.",

While a plethora of tools have been developed for the analysis of 16S rRNA gene data, only a few platforms offer a user-friendly interface and none comprehensively covers the whole analysis pipeline from raw data processing down to complex analysis. We introduce Namco, an R shiny application that offers a streamlined interface and serves as a one-stop solution for microbiome analysis. We demonstrate Namcos capabilities by studying the association between a rich fibre diet and the gut microbiota composition. Namco helped to prove the hypothesis that butyrate-producing bacteria are prompted by fibre-enriched intervention. Namco provides a broad range of features from raw data processing and basic statistics down to machine learning and network analysis, thus covering complex data analysis tasks that are not comprehensively covered elsewhere. Namco is freely available at https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/Namco/.\n\nImpact statementAmplicon sequencing is a key technology of microbiome research and has yielded many insights into the complexity and diversity of microbiota. To fully leverage these data, a wide range of tools have been developed for raw data processing, normalization, statistical analysis and visualization. These tools are mostly available as R packages but cannot be easily linked in an automated pipeline due to the heterogeneous characteristics of microbiome data. Instead, user-friendly tools for explorative analysis are needed to give biomedical researchers without experience in scripting languages the possibility to fully exploit their data. Several tools for microbiome data analysis have been proposed in recent years which cover a broad range of functionality but few offer a user-friendly and beginner-friendly interface while covering the entire value whole value chain from raw data processing down to complex analysis.

    "abstract": "BackgroundMutation specific synthetic lethal partners (SLPs) offer significant insights in identifying novel targets and designing personalized treatments in cancer studies. Large scale genetic screens in cell lines and model organisms provide crucial resources for mining SLPs, yet those experiments are expensive and might be difficult to set up. Various computational methods have been proposed to predict the potential SLPs from different perspectives. However, those efforts are hampered by the low signal-to-noise ratio in simple correlation based approaches, or incomplete reliable training sets in supervised approaches.\n\nResultsHere we present mslp, a comprehensive pipeline to identify potential SLPs via integrating genomic and transcriptomic datasets from both patient tumours and cancer cell lines. Leveraging cuttingedges algorithms, we identify a broad spectrum of primary SLPs for mutations presented in patient tumours. Further, for mutations detected in cell lines, we develop the idea of consensus SLPs which are also identified as screen hits, and show consistency impact on cell viability. Applied in real datasets, we successfully identified known synthetic lethal gene pairs. Remarkably, genetic screen results suggested that consensus SLPs have a significant impact on cell viability compared to common hits.\n\nConclusionsMslp is a powerful and flexible pipeline to identify potential SLPs in a cancer context-specific manner, which might aid in drug developments and precise medicines in cancer treatments. The pipeline is implemented in R and freely available in github.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity is often attributed to a dynamic equilibrium between immigration of species and competition-driven extinction. This equilibrium forms a common basis for studying ecosystem assembly from a static reservoir of migrants-the mainland. Yet, natural ecosystems often consist of many coupled communities (i.e. metacommunities) and migration occurs between these communities. The pool of migrants then depends on what is sustained in the ecosystem, which in turn depends on the dynamic migrant pool. This chicken-and-egg problem of survival and migration is poorly understood in communities of many competing species, except for the neutral case - the \"unified neutral theory of biodiversity\". Employing spatio-temporal simulations and mean-field analyses, we show that self-consistent migration puts rather tight constraints on the dynamic migration-extinction equilibrium. When the number of species is large, even weak competitions push species to the edge of their global extinction, such that the overall diversity is highly sensitive to perturbations in demographic parameters, including growth and dispersal rates. When migration is short-range, the resulting spatiotemporal abundance patterns follow broad scale-free distributions that correspond to a directed percolation phase transition. The qualitative agreement of our results for short-range and long-range migration suggests that this self-organization process is a general property of species-rich metacommunities. Our study shows that self-sustaining metacommunities are highly sensitive to environmental change and provides insights into how biodiversity can be rescued and maintained.",

    "abstract": "Bicarbonate secretion is a fundamental process involved in maintaining acid-base homeostasis. Disruption of bicarbonate entry into airway lumen, as has been observed in cystic fibrosis, produces several defects in lung function due to thick mucus accumulation. Bicarbonate is critical for correct mucin deployment and there is increasing interest in understanding its role in airway physiology, particularly in the initiation of lung disease in children affected by cystic fibrosis, in the absence of detectable bacterial infection. The current model of anion secretion in mammalian airways consists of CFTR and TMEM16A as apical anion exit channels, with limited capacity for bicarbonate transport compared to chloride. However, both channels can couple to SLC26A4 anion exchanger to maximise bicarbonate secretion. Nevertheless, current models lack any details about the identity of the basolateral protein(s) responsible for bicarbonate uptake into airway epithelial cells. We report herein that the electrogenic, sodium-dependent, bicarbonate cotransporter, SLC4A4, is expressed in the basolateral membrane of human and mouse airways, and that its pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing reduces bicarbonate secretion. In fully differentiated primary human airway cells, SLC4A4 inhibition induced an acidification of the airways surface liquid and markedly reduced the capacity of cells to recover from an acid load. Studies in the Slc4a4-null mice revealed a previously unreported lung phenotype, characterized by mucus accumulation and reduced mucociliary clearance. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the reduction of SLC4A4 function induced a CF-like phenotype, even when chloride secretion remained intact, highlighting the important role SLC4A4 plays in bicarbonate secretion and mammalian airway function.",

    "abstract": "During infection, plant pathogenic fungi secrete a set of molecules collectively known as effectors, involved in overcoming the host immune system and in disease establishment. Effector genes are concertedly expressed as waves all along plant pathogenic fungi lifecycle. However, little is known about how coordinated expression of effector genes is regulated. Since many effector genes are located in repeat-rich regions, the role of chromatin remodeling in the regulation of effector expression was recently investigated. In Leptosphaeria maculans, causing stem canker of oilseed rape, we established that the repressive histone modification H3K9me3 (trimethylation of Lysine 9 of Histone H3), deposited by the histone methyltransferase KMT1, was involved in the regulation of expression of genes highly expressed during infection, including effectors. Nevertheless, inactivation of KMT1 did not induce expression of these genes at the same level as observed during infection of oilseed rape, suggesting that a second regulator, such as a transcription factor (TF), might be involved. Pf2, a TF belonging to the Zn2Cys6 fungal specific TF family, was described in several Dothideomycete species as essential for pathogenicity and effector gene expression. We identified the orthologue of Pf2 in L. maculans, LmPf2, and investigated the role of LmPf2 together with KMT1, by inactivating and over-expressing LmPf2 in a wild type (WT) strain and a{Delta} kmt1 mutant. Functional analyses of the corresponding transformants highlighted an essential role of LmPf2 in the establishment of pathogenesis. Transcriptomic analyses during axenic growth showed that LmPf2 is involved in the control of effector gene expression. We observed an enhanced effect of the over-expression of LmPf2 on effector gene expression in a{Delta} kmt1 background, suggesting an antagonist role between KMT1 and LmPf2.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis of resting-state fMRI data is commonly performed by calculating sliding-window correlations (SWC), followed by k-means clustering in order to assign each window to a given state. Studies using synthetic data have shown that k-means performance is highly dependent on sliding window parameters and signal-to-noise ratio. Additionally, sources of heterogeneity between subjects may affect the accuracy of group-level clustering, thus affecting measurements of dFC state temporal properties such as dwell time and fractional occupancy. This may result in spurious conclusions regarding differences between groups (e.g. when comparing a clinical population to healthy controls). Therefore, is it important to quantify the ability of k-means to estimate dFC state temporal properties when applied to cohorts of multiple subjects, and to explore ways in which clustering performance can be maximised.\n\nHere, we explore the use of dimensionality reduction methods prior to clustering in order to map high-dimensional data to a lower dimensional space, providing salient features to the subsequent clustering step. We assess the use of deep autoencoders for feature selection prior to applying k-means clustering to the encoded data. We compare this deep clustering method to feature selection using principle component analysis (PCA), uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), as well as applying k-means to the original feature space using either L1 or L2 distance. We provide extensive quantitative evaluation of clustering performance using synthetic datasets, representing data from multiple heterogeneous subjects. In synthetic data we find that deep clustering gives the best performance, while other approaches are often insufficient to capture temporal properties of dFC states. We then demonstrate the application of each method to real-world data from human subjects and show that the choice of feature selection method has a significant effect on group-level measurements of state temporal properties. We therefore advocate for the use of deep clustering as a precursor to clustering in dFC.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine whether the complexity of the animal soil food web (SFWC) is a significant factor influencing the soil microbial communities, the productivity of the willow, and the degradation rates of 100 mg kg-1 phenanthrene contamination. The SFWC treatment had eight levels: just the microbial community (BF), or the BF with nematodes (N), springtails (C), earthworms (E), CE, CN, EN, CEN. After eight weeks of growth, the height and biomass of willows were significantly affected by the SFWC, whereas the amount of phenanthrene degraded was not affected, reaching over 95% in all pots. SFWC affected the structure and the composition of the bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities, with significant effects of SFWC on the relative abundance of fungal genera such as Sphaerosporella, a known willow symbiont during phytoremediation, and bacterial phyla such as Actinobacteriota, containing many PAH degraders. These SFWC effects on microbial communities were not clearly reflected in the community structure and abundance of PAH degraders, even though some degraders related to the Actinobacteriota and the diversity of Gram-negative degraders were affected by the SFWC treatments. Overall, our results suggest that, under our experimental conditions, SFWC does not affect significantly willow phytoremediation outcomes.\n\nImportancePolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) pose a threat to soil ecosystems. Phytoremediation is a green technology that can help restore ecosystems health affected by PAH contamination. Past research on phytoremediation of PAH has focused on the roles of plant and microbes in contaminant fates. However, soil environments usually harbor large faunal communities that interact with both the plant and the microbial communities, potentially altering the phytoremediation process. We hypothesized that soil food web complexity (SFWC), represented by increasing levels of soil fauna, influences PAH degradation through interactions with the plant and the microbes. In this study, we demonstrated that SFWC increases the plant biomass and changes the composition of the microbial community, especially the fungal structure. In our pot experiment, more complex levels of SFWC did not contribute to higher degradation rates, but the increased plant biomass and the higher relative abundance of fungal genera associated with lower plant stress could indirectly contribute to better phytoremediation outcomes. Our results highlight the importance of considering the contributions of soil fauna to the success of phytoremediation.",

We leveraged single cell and bulk RNA-seq, quantitative immunofluorescent lineage/fate tracing, and genetically modified human iPSC to revisit this question in developing mouse kidneys and human kidney organoids. We confirmed that Notch signaling is needed for maturation of all nephron lineages, and thus mature lineage markers fail to detect a fate bias. By contrast, early markers identified a distal fate bias in cells lacking Notch2, and a concomitant increase in early proximal and podocyte fates in cells expressing hyperactive Notch1 was observed. Orthogonal support for a conserved role for Notch signaling in the distal/proximal axis segmentation is provided by the ability of Nicastrin-deficient hiPSCs-derived organoids to differentiate into TFA2B+ distal tubule and CDH1 connecting segment progenitors, but not into HNF4A+ or LTL+ proximal progenitors.\n\nSummaryNotch signaling acts in nephron segmentation to select early proximal, but not distal tubule fate downstream of a global role promoting epithelial growth and maturation in mouse and human.",

In America H. pylori has evolved in several subpopulations specific for regions or even countries. In this study we analyzed the genome of 163 Colombian strains along with 1,113 strains that represent worldwide H. pylori populations to better discern the ancestry and adaption to Colombian people. Population structure was inferred with FineStructure and chromosome painting identifying the proportion of ancestries in Colombian isolates. Phylogenetic relationship was analyzed using the SNPs present in the core genome. Also, a Fst analysis was done to identify the gene variants with the strongest fixation in the identified Colombian subpopulations in relation to their parent population hspSWEurope. Worldwide, population structure analysis allowed the identification of two Colombian subpopulations, the previously described hspSWEuropeColombia and a novel subpopulation named hspColombia. In addition, three subgroups of H. pylori were identified within hspColombia that follow their geographic origin. The Colombian H. pylori subpopulations represent an admixture of European, African and Native indigenous ancestry; although some genomes showed a high proportion of self-identity, suggesting a strong adaption to these mestizo Colombian groups. The Fst analysis identified 82 SNPs significantly fixed in 26 genes of the hspColombia subpopulation that encode mainly for outer membrane proteins and proteins involved in central metabolism. The strongest fixation indices were identified in genes encoding the membrane proteins HofC, HopE, FrpB-4 and Sialidase A. These findings demonstrate that H. pylori has evolved in Colombia to give rise to subpopulations following a geographical structure, evolving to an autochthonous genetic pool, drive by a positive selective pressure especially on genes encoding for outer membrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "The problem of entrainment is central to circadian biology. In this regard, Drosophila has been an important model system. Owing to the simplicity of its nervous system and the availability of powerful genetic tools, the system has shed significant light on the molecular and neural underpinnings of entrainment. However, much remains to be learned regarding the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying this important phenomenon. Under cyclic light/dark conditions, Drosophila melanogaster displays crepuscular patterns of locomotor activity with one peak anticipating dawn and the other anticipating dusk. These peaks are characterized through an estimation of their phase relative to the environmental light cycle and the extent of their anticipation of light transitions. In Drosophila chronobiology, estimations of phases are often subjective, and anticipation indices vary significantly between studies. Though there is increasing interest in building flexible analysis software tools in the field, none incorporates objective measures of Drosophila activity peaks in combination with the analysis of fly activity/sleep in the same program. To this end, we have developed PHASE, a MATLAB-based program that is simple and easy to use and (i) supports the visualization and analysis of activity and sleep under entrainment, (ii) allows analysis of both activity and sleep parameters within user-defined windows within a diurnal cycle, (iii) uses a smoothing filter for the objective identification of peaks of activity (and therefore can be used to quantitatively characterize them), and (iv) offers a series of analyses for the assessment of behavioral anticipation of environmental transitions.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of UVC to reduce airborne-mediated disease transmission is well-established. However conventional germicidal UVC (~254 nm) cannot be used directly in occupied spaces because of the potential for damage to the skin and eye. A recently studied alternative with the potential to be used directly in occupied spaces is far-UVC (200 to 235 nm, typically 222 nm), as it cannot penetrate to the key living cells in the epidermis. Optimal far-UVC use is hampered by limited knowledge of the precise wavelength dependence of UVC-induced DNA damage, and thus we have used a monochromatic UVC exposure system to assess wavelength-dependent DNA damage in a realistic 3-D human skin model. We exposed a 3-D human skin model to mono-wavelength UVC exposures of 100 mJ/cm2, at UVC wavelengths from 215 to 255 nm (5-nm steps). At each wavelength we measured yields of DNA-damaged keratinocytes, and their distribution within the layers of the epidermis. No increase in DNA damage was observed in the epidermis at wavelengths from 215 to 235 nm, but at higher wavelengths (240-255 nm) significant levels of DNA damage were observed. These results support use of far-UVC light to safely reduce the risk of airborne disease transmission in occupied locations.",

Representation of uncertainty has been established in sensory systems during simple perceptual decision making tasks but it remains unclear if complex cognitive computations such as planning and navigation are also supported by probabilistic neural representations. Here we capitalized on gradually changing uncertainty along planned motion trajectories during hippocampal theta sequences to capture signatures of uncertainty representation in population responses. In contrast with prominent theories, we found no evidence of encoding parameters of probability distributions in the momentary population activity recorded in an open-field navigation task in rats. Instead, uncertainty was encoded sequentially by sampling motion trajectories randomly in subsequent theta cycles from the distribution of potential trajectories. Our analysis is the first to demonstrate that the hippocampus is well equipped to contribute to optimal planning by representing uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Agrochemicals often contaminate freshwater bodies, affecting microbial communities that underlie aquatic food webs. For example, Roundup, a widely-used glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH), has the potential to indirectly select for antibiotic resistant bacteria. Such cross-selection could occur, for example, if the same genes (e.g. encoding efflux pumps) confer resistance to both glyphosate and antibiotics. To test for cross-resistance in natural aquatic bacterial communities, we added Roundup to 1,000-L mesocosms filled with water from a pristine lake. Over 57 days, we tracked changes in bacterial communities with shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and annotated metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) for the presence of known antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), plasmids, and resistance mutations in the enzyme targeted by glyphosate (enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase; EPSPS). We found that high doses of GBH significantly increased ARG frequency and selected for multidrug efflux pumps in particular. The relative abundance of MAGs after a high dose of GBH was predictable based on the number of ARGs encoded in their genomes (17% of variation explained) and, to a lesser extent, by resistance mutations in EPSPS. Together, these results indicate that GBHs have the potential to cross-select for antibiotic resistance in natural freshwater bacteria.\n\nIMPORTANCEGlyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) such as Roundup may have the unintended consequence of selecting for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), as demonstrated in previous experiments. However, the effects of GBHs on ARGs remains unknown in natural aquatic communities, which are often contaminated with pesticides from agricultural runoff. Moreover, the resistance provided by ARGs compared to canonical mutations in the glyphosate target enzyme, EPSPS, remains unclear. Here we used freshwater mesocosm experiments to show that GBHs strongly select for ARGs, particularly multidrug efflux pumps. These selective effects are evident after just a few days, and at glyphosate concentrations that are high but still within short-term (1-4 day) regulatory limits. The ability of bacteria to survive and thrive after GBH stress was predictable by the number of ARGs in their genomes, and to a lesser extent by mutations in EPSPS. GBHs are therefore likely to select for higher ARG frequencies in natural streams, lakes, and ponds.",

However, the cost associated with their generation often involve expensive, plate, media, and growth supplements, which have limited their use for high throughput experiments. The protocol herein presents a novel and rapid generation for single spheroids of various cancer cell lines, U87 MG; SEBTA-027; SF188, brain cancer cells, DU-145, TRAMP-C1, prostate cancer cells, in 96-round bottom well plates. Cells are washed with anti-adherent solution, and the homogeneous compact spheroid morphology was evidenced as early as 24 hours after 10 minutes centrifugation for the seeded cells. By using confocal microscopy, the proliferating cells were traced in the rim and the dead cells were found inside the core region of the spheroid. The H&E stain of spheroid slices and the western blotting were utilised to investigate the tightness of the cell packaging by adhesion proteins. Carnosine was used as an example of treatment for U87 single spheroids.

This article explores the application of power-weighted path metrics for the analysis of single cell RNA data.\n\nExtensive experiments on single cell RNA sequencing data sets confirm the usefulness of path metrics for dimension reduction and clustering. Distances between cells are measured in a data-driven way which is both density sensitive (decreasing distances across high density regions) and respects the underlying data geometry. By combining path metrics with multidimensional scaling, a low dimensional embedding of the data is obtained which respects both the global geometry of the data and preserves cluster structure. We evaluate the method both for clustering quality and geometric fidelity, and it outperforms other algorithms on a wide range of bench marking data sets.",

While transcriptional regulation downstream of RAS is relatively well characterized, how RAS post-transcriptionally modulates gene expression to promote malignancy is largely unclear. Using quantitative RNA Interactome Capture analysis, we reveal that oncogenic RAS signaling reshapes the RNA-bound proteomic landscape of cancer cells, with a network of nuclear proteins centered around Nucleolin displaying enhanced RNA-binding activity. We show that Nucleolin is phosphorylated downstream of RAS, which increases its binding to pre-ribosomal-RNA (rRNA), boosts rRNA production, and promotes ribosome biogenesis. This Nucleolin-dependent enhancement of ribosome biogenesis is crucial for RAS-induced cancer cell proliferation, and can be targeted therapeutically to inhibit tumor growth. Our results reveal that oncogenic RAS signaling drives ribosome biogenesis by regulating the RNA-binding activity of Nucleolin, and highlight the crucial role of this process in RAS-mediated tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Global regulation of spindle-associated proteins is crucial in oocytes due to the absence of centrosomes and their very large cytoplasmic volume, but little is known about how this is achieved beyond involvement of the Ran-importin pathway. We previously uncovered a novel regulatory mechanism in Drosophila oocytes, in which the phospho-docking protein 14-3-3 suppresses microtubule binding of Kinesin-14/Ncd away from chromosomes. Here we report systematic identification of microtubule-associated proteins regulated by 14-3-3 from Drosophila oocytes. Proteins from ovary extract were co-sedimented with microtubules in the presence or absence of a 14-3-3 inhibitor. Through quantitative mass-spectrometry, we identified proteins or complexes whose ability to binding microtubules is suppressed by 14-3-3, including the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), the centralspindlin complex and Kinesin-14/Ncd. We showed that 14-3-3 binds to the disordered region of Borealin, and this binding is regulated differentially by two phosphorylations on Borealin. Mutations at these two phospho-sites compromised normal Borealin localisation and centromere bi-orientation in oocytes, showing that phospho-regulation of 14-3-3 binding is important for Borealin localisation and function. The mass spectrometry data are available from ProteomeXchange, identifier <ID to be provided when available, PXD000xxx>.\n\nAuthor SummaryAccurate segregation of chromosomes during cell division is fundamental for genome stability. Chromosome segregation is mediated by the spindle, which is made of dynamic microtubules and associated proteins that regulate microtubule behaviour. How these microtubule-associated proteins are regulated is not well understood. Furthermore, as oocytes have an exceptionally large volume of cytoplasm and lack centrosomes, regulation of microtubule-associated proteins is especially crucial for organisation and function of the meiotic spindle. In this study, we showed that 14-3-3, a protein that binds to phosphorylated proteins, plays an important role to regulate multiple microtubule-associated proteins in fly oocytes. The regulated proteins include subunits of the conserved kinase complex called the chromosomal passenger complex. We further found that interaction of one of the subunits with 14-3-3 is regulated by two phosphorylations, and that these phosphorylations are important for localisation and function of this subunit. As these proteins are widely conserved including humans, this study may provide an insight into chromosome mis-segregation in human oocytes, which is very frequent and a major cause of human infertility, miscarriages and congenital birth conditions.",

    "abstract": "Mitosis is a fundamental process in every eukaryote, in which chromosomes are segregated into two daughter cells by the action of the microtubule (MT)-based spindle. Despite this common principle, genes essential for mitosis are variable among organisms. This indicates that the loss of essential genes or bypass-of-essentiality (BOE) occurred multiple times during evolution. While many BOE relationships have been recently revealed experimentally, the BOE of mitosis regulators (BOE-M) has been scarcely reported and how this occurs remains largely unknown. Here, by mutagenesis and subsequent evolutionary repair experiments, we isolated viable fission yeast strains that lacked the entire coding region of Polo-like kinase (Plk), a versatile essential mitotic kinase. The BOE of Plk was enabled by specific mutations in the downstream machinery, including the MT-nucleating {gamma}-tubulin complex, and more surprisingly, through downregulation of glucose uptake, which is not readily connected to mitosis. The latter bypass was dependent on casein kinase I (CK1), which has not been considered as a major mitotic regulator. Our genetic and phenotypic data suggest that CK1 constitutes an alternative mechanism of MT nucleation, which is normally dominated by Plk. A similar relationship was observed in a human colon cancer cell line. Thus, our study shows that BOE-M can be achieved by simple genetic or environmental changes, consistent with the occurrence of BOE-M during evolution. Furthermore, the identification of BOE-M constitutes a powerful means to uncover a hitherto under-studied mechanism driving mitosis and also hints at the limitations and solutions for selecting chemotherapeutic compounds targeting mitosis.",

Clinical management continues to rely on nonspecific chemotherapeutic agents that are associated with treatment resistance and toxicity. Here, we analyzed 103 whole exomes, 16 whole transcriptomes, 5 single-cell transcriptomes, and 4 whole genomes from primary Rb tumors to identify novel Rb dependencies. Several recurrent genomic aberrations implicate estrogen-related receptor gamma (ESRRG) in Rb pathogenesis. RB1 directly interacts with and inhibits ESRRG, and RB1 loss uncouples ESRRG from negative regulation. ESRRG regulates genes involved in retinogenesis and oxygen metabolism in Rb cells. ESRRG is preferentially expressed in hypoxic Rb cells in vivo. Depletion or inhibition of ESRRG causes marked Rb cell death which is exacerbated in hypoxia. These findings reveal a novel dependency of Rb cells on ESRRG, and they implicate ESRRG as a potential therapeutic vulnerability in Rb.",

    "abstract": "Polycomb Repressive Complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1, PRC2) are conserved epigenetic regulators that promote transcriptional silencing. PRC1 and PRC2 converge on shared targets, catalyzing repressive histone modifications. In addition, a subset of PRC1/PRC2 targets engage in long-range interactions whose functions in gene silencing are poorly understood. Using a CRISPR screen in mouse embryonic stem cells, we identified that the cohesin regulator PDS5A links transcriptional silencing by Polycomb and 3D genome organization. PDS5A deletion impairs cohesin unloading and results in derepression of subset of endogenous PRC1/PRC2 target genes. Importantly, derepression is not associated with loss of repressive Polycomb chromatin modifications. Instead, loss of PDS5A leads to aberrant cohesin activity, ectopic insulation sites and specific reduction of ultra-long Polycomb loops. We infer that these loops are important for robust silencing at a subset of Polycomb target genes and that maintenance of cohesin-dependent genome architecture is critical for Polycomb regulation.",

In 130 schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and controls, we confirmed a marked reduction in sleep spindle density in SCZ and extended these findings to show that only slow spindles predicted symptom severity, and that fast and slow spindle properties were largely uncorrelated. We also describe a novel measure of slow oscillation and spindle interaction that was attenuated in SCZ. The main sleep findings were replicated in a demographically distinct sample, and a joint model, based on multiple NREM components, predicted disease status in the replication cohort. Although also altered in patients, auditory event-related potentials elicited during wake were unrelated to NREM metrics. Consistent with a growing literature implicating thalamocortical dysfunction in SCZ, our characterization identifies independent NREM and wake EEG biomarkers that may index distinct aspects of SCZ pathophysiology and point to multiple neural mechanisms underlying disease heterogeneity. This study lays the groundwork for evaluating these neurophysiological markers, individually or in combination, to guide efforts at treatment and prevention as well as identifying individuals most likely to benefit from specific interventions.",

We find that cortex can synchronize to dynamic binaural cues up to approximately 10 Hz, which aligns well with our measured limits of perceiving dynamic spatial information and utilizing dynamic binaural cues for spatial unmasking, i.e. measures of binaural sluggishness. We also find the tracking limit for frequency modulation (FM) is similar to the limit for spatial tracking, demonstrating that this sluggish tracking is a more general perceptual limit that can be accounted for by cortical temporal integration limits.",

Yet, suppression has been also found for stimuli merely coinciding with actions, pointing to unspecific processes that may be driven by neuromodulatory systems. Meanwhile, the differential processing for self-generated stimuli raises the possibility of producing effects also on memory for these stimuli, however, evidence remains mixed as to the direction of the effects. Here, we assessed the effects of actions on sensory processing and memory encoding of concomitant, but unpredictable sounds, using a combination of self-generation and memory recognition task concurrently with EEG and pupil recordings. At encoding, subjects performed button presses that half of the time generated a sound (motor-auditory; MA) and listened to passively presented sounds (auditory-only; A). At retrieval, two sounds were presented and participants had to respond which one was present before. We measured memory bias and memory performance by having sequences where either both or only one of the test sounds were presented at encoding, respectively. Results showed worse memory performance - but no differences in memory bias - and attenuated responses and larger pupil diameter for MA compared to A sounds. Critically, the larger the sensory attenuation and pupil diameter, the worse the memory performance for MA sounds. Nevertheless, sensory attenuation did not correlate with pupil dilation. Collectively, our findings suggest that sensory attenuation and neuromodulatory processes coexist during actions, and both relate to disrupted memory for concurrent, albeit unpredictable sounds.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of age-inappropriate cognitive decline, which could develop into dementia - an untreatable neurodegenerative disorder. An early detection of MCI is a crucial step for timely prevention and intervention. To tackle this problem, recent studies have developed deep learning models to detect MCI and various types of dementia using data obtained from the classic clock-drawing test (CDT), a popular neuropsychological screening tool that can be easily and rapidly implemented for assessing cognitive impairments in an aging population. While these models succeed at distinguishing severe forms of dementia, it is still difficult to predict the early stage of the disease using the CDT data alone. Also, the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques still face the black-box challenges, making it questionable to implement them in the clinical setting. Here, we propose a novel deep learning modeling framework that incorporates data from multiple drawing tasks including the CDT, cube-copying, and trail-making tasks obtained from a digital platform. Using self-attention and soft-label methods, our model achieves much higher classification performance at detecting MCI compared to those of a well-established convolutional neural network model. Moreover, our model can highlight features of the MCI data that considerably deviate from those of the healthy aging population, offering accurate predictions for detecting MCI along with visual explanation that aids the interpretation of the deep learning model.",

Thus, therapies to promote or accelerate myelination could potentially ameliorate symptoms in autism. Clemastine, a histamine H1 antagonist with anticholinergic properties against muscarinic M1 receptor, is the most promising drug with promyelinating properties (Mei et al., 2014). Clemastine penetrates the blood brain barrier efficiently and promotes remyelination in different animal models of neurodegeneration including multiple sclerosis, ischemia and Alzheimers disease. However, its role in myelination during development is unknown. We showed that clemastine treatment during development increase oligodendrocyte differentiation in both white and gray matter. However, despite the increase in the number of oligodendrocytes, conduction velocity of myelinated fibers of corpus callosum decreased in clemastine treated mice. Confocal and electron microscopy showed a reduction in the number of myelinated axons and nodes of Ranvier and a reduction of myelin thickness in corpus callosum. To understand the mechanisms leading to myelin formation impairment in the presence of an excess of myelinating oligodendrocytes, we focused on microglial cells which also express muscarinic M1 receptors. Importantly, the population of CD11c+microglia cells, necessary for myelination, as well as the levels of insulin growth factor-1 decrease in clemastine-treated mice. Altogether, these data suggest that clemastine impact on myelin development is more complex than previously thought and could be dependent on microglia-oligodendrocyte crosstalk. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of microglia cells on developmental myelination.",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia direct and indirect pathways are viewed to mediate opposing functions in movement. However, this classic model is challenged by recent findings that both pathways are coactive during behavior. We examined the roles of direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) pathway spiny projection neurons in a decision-making task with a short-term memory (STM) component. Optogenetic stimulation of cortical-input-defined dSPNs and iSPNs during STM oppositely biased upcoming licking choice, without affecting licking execution. Optogenetically identified dSPNs and iSPNs showed similar response patterns, although with quantitative difference in spatiotemporal organization. To understand how coactive dSPNs and iSPNs play opposing roles, we recorded population activity in frontal cortex and the basal ganglia output nucleus SNr. Stimulation of dSPNs and iSPNs bidirectionally regulated cortical decision variable through the differential modulation of SNr ramping activity. These results reconcile different views by demonstrating that coactive dSPNs and iSPNs precisely shape cortical activity in a push-pull balance.",

    "abstract": "The dorsal vagal complex (DVC) is a brainstem site regulating diverse aspects of physiology including food intake and blood glucose homeostasis. Astrocytes are purported to play an active role in regulating DVC function and, by extension, physiological parameters. Previous work has demonstrated that DVC astrocytes directly sense hormones that regulate food intake and blood glucose and are critical for their effect. In addition, DVC astrocytes in ex vivo slices respond to low tissue glucose. The response of neurons, including catecholaminergic neurons, to low glucose is conditional on intact astrocyte signalling in slice preparations suggesting astrocytes are possibly the primary sensors of glucose deprivation (glucoprivation). Based on these findings we hypothesised that if DVC astrocytes act as glucoprivation sensors in vivo they would both show a response to systemic glucoprivation and drive physiological responses to restore blood glucose. We found that 2 hours of systemic glucoprivation induced neither FOS nor glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactivity in DVC astrocytes, specifically those in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Furthermore, we found that while chemogenetic activation of DVC astrocytes suppressed food intake by reducing both meal size and meal number, this manipulation also suppressed food intake under conditions of glucoprivation. Chemogenetic activation of DVC astrocytes did not increase basal blood glucose nor protect against insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. In male mice chemogenetic DVC astrocyte activation did not alter glucose tolerance, in female mice the initial glucose excursion was reduced, suggesting enhanced glucose absorption. Taken together this suggests that as a whole-population DVC astrocytes do not function as glucoprivation sensors in vivo in mice. Instead, we propose that DVC astrocytes play an indispensable, homeostatic role to maintain the function of glucoregulatory neuronal circuitry.",

However, in most cases it remains unclear whether and how such latency codes are utilized by postsynaptic neurons. In the active electrosensory system of mormyrid fish, a latency code for stimulus amplitude in electroreceptor afferent nerve fibers (EAs) is hypothesized to be read out by a central reference provided by motor corollary discharge (CD). Here we demonstrate that CD enhances sensory responses in postsynaptic granular cells of the electrosensory lobe, but is not required for reading out EA input. Instead, diverse latency and spike count tuning across the EA population gives rise to graded information about stimulus amplitude that can be read out by standard integration of converging excitatory synaptic inputs. Inhibitory control over the temporal window of integration renders two granular cell subclasses differentially sensitive to information derived from relative spike latency versus spike count.",

    "abstract": "Population-level modeling can define quantitative measures of individual aging by applying machine learning to large volumes of brain images. These measures of brain age, obtained from the general population, helped characterize disease severity in neurological populations, improving estimates of diagnosis or prognosis. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) have the potential to further generalize this approach towards prevention and public health by enabling assessments of brain health at large scales in socioeconomically diverse environments. However, more research is needed to define methods that can handle the complexity and diversity of M/EEG signals across diverse real-world contexts. To catalyse this effort, here we propose reusable benchmarks of competing machine learning approaches for brain age modeling. We benchmarked popular classical machine learning pipelines and deep learning architectures previously used for pathology decoding or brain age estimation in 4 international M/EEG cohorts from diverse countries and cultural contexts, including recordings from more than 2500 participants. Our benchmarks were built on top of the M/EEG adaptations of the BIDS standard, providing tools that can be applied with minimal modification on any M/EEG dataset provided in the BIDS format. Our results suggest that, regardless of whether classical machine learning or deep learning was used, the highest performance was reached by pipelines and architectures involving spatially aware representations of the M/EEG signals, leading to R^2 scores between 0.60-0.71. Hand-crafted features paired with random forest regression provided robust benchmarks even in situations in which other approaches failed. Taken together, this set of benchmarks, accompanied by open-source software and high-level Python scripts, can serve as a starting point and quantitative reference for future efforts at developing M/EEG-based measures of brain aging. The generality of the approach renders this benchmark reusable for other related objectives such as modeling specific cognitive variables or clinical endpoints.\n\nHighlights- We provide systematic reusable benchmarks for brain age from M/EEG signals\n- The benchmarks were carried out on M/EEG from four countries > 2500 recordings\n- We compared machine learning pipelines capable of handling the non-linear regression task of relating biomedical outcomes to M/EEG dynamics, based on classical machine learning and deep learning\n- Next to data-driven methods we benchmarked template-based source localization as a practical tool for generating features less affected by electromagnetic field spread\n- The benchmarks are built on top of the MNE ecosystem and the braindecode package and can be applied on any M/EEG dataset presented in the BIDS format",

Time segments when participants experienced navigational uncertainty were first identified using a combination of objective measurements (frequency of inputs into the VR controller) and behavioral annotations from two independent observers. Uncertainty time-segments during navigation were ranked on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high). The machine-learning model, a random forest classifier implemented using scikit-learn in Python, was used to evaluate common spatial patterns of EEG spectral power across the theta, alpha, and beta bands associated with the researcher-identified uncertainty states. The overall predictive power of the resulting model was 0.70 in terms of the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (ROC-AUC). These findings indicate that EEG data can potentially be used as a metric for identifying navigational uncertainty states, which may provide greater rigor and efficiency in studies of human responses to architectural design variables and wayfinding cues.",

    "abstract": "Patients with oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) defects causing mitochondrial diseases appear particularly vulnerable to infections. Although OxPhos defects modulate cytokine production in vitro and in animal models, little is known about how circulating leukocytes of patients with inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) defects respond to acute immune challenges. In a small cohort of healthy controls (n=21) and patients (n=12) with either the m.3243A>G mutation or single, large-scale mtDNA deletions, we examined: i) cytokine responses (IL-6, TNF-, IL-1{beta}) in response to acute lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure, and ii) sensitivity to the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoid signaling (dexamethasone) on cytokine production. In dose-response experiments to determine the half-maximal effective LPS concentration (EC50), relative to controls, leukocytes from patients with mtDNA deletions showed 74 - 79% lower responses for IL-6 and IL-1{beta} (pIL-6=0.031, pIL-1{beta}=0.009). Moreover, IL-6 response to LPS in presence of GC was also blunted in cells from patients with mtDNA deletions (pIL-6=0.006), but not in leukocytes from patients with the m.3243A>G mutation. Overall, these ex vivo data provide preliminary evidence that some systemic OxPhos defects may compromise immune cytokine responses and glucocorticoid sensitivity. Further work in larger cohorts is needed to define the nature of immune dysregulation in patients with mitochondrial disease, and their potential implications for disease phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, age prediction based on DNA methylation has become a vastly investigated topic; many age prediction models have been developed based on different DNAm markers and using various tissues. However, the potential of using nails to this end has not yet been explored. Their inherent resistance to decay and ease of sampling would offer an advantage in cases where post-mortem degradation poses challenges concerning sample collection and DNA-extraction. In the current study, clippings from both fingernails and toenails were collected from 108 living test subjects (age range: 0 - 96 years). The methylation status of 15 CpGs located in 4 previously established age-related markers (ASPA, EDARADD, PDE4C, ELOVL2) was investigated through pyrosequencing of bisulphite converted DNA. Significant dissimilarities in methylation levels were observed between all four limbs, hence limb-specific age prediction models were developed using ordinary least squares, weighted least squares and quantile regression analysis. When applied to their respective test sets, these models yielded a mean absolute deviation between predicted and chronological age ranging from 6.71 to 8.48 years. In addition, the assay was tested on methylation data derived from 5 nail samples collected from deceased individuals, demonstrating its feasibility for application in post-mortem cases. In conclusion, this study provides the first proof that chronological age can be assessed through DNA methylation patterns in nails.",

Here, we conducted four psychophysical experiments with separate groups of participants to investigate the possibility of preventing the interference in short-term perceptual training. We trained the participants to detect two orientations of Gabor stimuli in two adjacent days at the same retinal location and examined the interference of training effects between the two orientations. The results showed significant retroactive interference from the second orientation to the first orientation (Experiments 1 and 2). Introducing a 6-hour interval between the pre-test and training of the second orientation did not eliminate the interference effect, excluding the interpretation of disrupted reconsolidation as the pre-test of the second orientation may reactivate and destabilize the representation of the first orientation (Experiment 3). Finally, the training of the two orientations was accompanied by fixations in two colors, each served as a contextual cue for one orientation. The results showed that the retroactive interference was not evident after introducing these passively perceived contextual cues (Experiment 4). Our findings suggest that the retroactive interference effect in short-term perceptual training of orientation detection tasks was likely the result of higher-level factors such as shared contextual cues embedded in the tasks. The effect of multiple perceptual training could be facilitated by associating the trained tasks with different contextual cues.",

    "abstract": "How does attention enhance neural representations of goal-relevant stimuli while suppressing representations of ignored stimuli across regions of the brain? While prior studies have shown that attention enhances visual responses, we lack a cohesive understanding of how selective attention modulates visual representations across the brain. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants performed a selective attention task on superimposed stimuli from multiple categories and used a data-driven approach to test how attention affects both decodability of category information and residual correlations (after regressing out stimulus-driven variance) with category-selective regions of ventral temporal cortex (VTC). Our data reveal three main findings. First, when two objects are simultaneously viewed, the category of the attended object can be decoded more readily than the category of the ignored object, with the greatest attentional enhancements observed in occipital and temporal lobes. Second, after accounting for the response to the stimulus, the correlation in the residual brain activity between a cortical region and a category-selective region of VTC was elevated when that regions preferred category was attended vs. ignored, and more so in the right occipital, parietal, and frontal cortices. Third, we found that the stronger the residual correlations between a given region of cortex and VTC, the better visual category information could be decoded from that region. These findings suggest that heightened residual correlations by selective attention may reflect the sharing of information between sensory regions and higher-order cortical regions to provide attentional enhancement of goal-relevant information.",

    "abstract": "Despite growing evidence of links between sulcation and function in the adult brain, the folding dynamics, occurring mostly before normal-term-birth, is vastly unknown. Looking into the development of cortical sulci in babies can give us keys to address fundamental questions: what is the sulcal shape variability in the developing brain? When are the shape features encoded? How are these morphological parameters related to further functional development?\n\nIn this study, we aimed to investigate the shape variability of the developing central sulcus, which is the frontier between the primary somatosensory and motor cortices. We studied a cohort of 71 extremely preterm infants scanned twice using MRI - once around 30 weeks post-menstrual age (w PMA) and once at term-equivalent age, around 40w PMA -, in order to quantify the sulcuss shape variability using manifold learning, regardless of age-group or hemisphere. We then used these shape descriptors to evaluate the sulcuss variability at both ages and to assess hemispheric and age- group specificities. This led us to propose a description of ten shape features capturing the variability in the central sulcus of preterm infants. Our results suggested that most of these features (8/10) are encoded as early as 30w PMA. We unprecedentedly observed hemispheric asymmetries at both ages, and the one captured at term-equivalent age seems to correspond with the asymmetry pattern previously reported in adults. We further trained classifiers in order to explore the predictive value of these shape features on manual performance at 5 years of age (handedness and fine motor outcome). The central sulcuss shape alone showed a limited but relevant predictive capacity in both cases. The study of sulcal shape features during early neurodevelopment may participate to a better comprehension of the complex links between morphological and functional organization of the developing brain.\n\nHighlights- Shape features can be isolated to describe quantitatively the development of the central sulcus.\n- Most shape characteristics of the central sulcus are already encoded at 30 weeks of post-menstrual age (w PMA) in preterm newborns.\n- The central sulcus shows subtle hemispheric asymmetries as soon as 30w PMA.\n- The early shape of the central sulcus can help predicting handedness and fine motor outcome at 5 years of age.",

Here, we presented clear and ambiguous affective speech to two groups of human participants during neuroimaging, while in one group we inhibited right IFC activity with transcranial magnetic stimulation. IFC activity inhibition led to faster affective decisions, more accurate choice probabilities, reduced auditory cortical activity and increased fronto-limbic connectivity for clear affective speech.

We used nuclear DNA data collected from 6285 vertebrate populations across the Americas to assess the role environmental variables play in structuring the spatial/latitudinal distribution of PGD, a key component of adaptive potential in the face of environmental change. Our results provide key evidence for taxa-specific responses and that temperature variability in addition to mean temperature may be a primary driver of PGD. Additionally, we found some positive influence of precipitation, productivity, and elevation on PGD; identified trends were dependent on the metric of PGD. In contrast to the classic negative relationship between species diversity and latitude, we report either a positive or taxa-dependent relationship between PGD and latitude, depending on the metric of PGD. The inconsistent latitudinal gradient in different metrics of PGD may be due to opposing processes diminishing patterns across latitudes that operate on different timescales, as well as the flattening of large-scale genetic gradients when assessing across species versus within species. Our study highlights the nuance required to assess broad patterns in genetic diversity, and the need for developing balanced conservation strategies that ensure population, species, and community persistence.",

    "abstract": "PARP13/ZAP acts against multiple viruses through recognizing and promoting degradation of cytoplasmic viral mRNA. PARP13 has four N-terminal Zn-finger motifs that bind CG-rich nucleotide sequences, and a C-terminal ADP ribosyltransferase fold similar to other PARPs. A central region predicted to contain a fifth Zn-finger and two tandem WWE domains is implicated in binding poly(ADP-ribose); however, there are limited insights into the structure and function of this PARP13 region (ZnF5-WWE1-WWE2). Here, we present crystal structures of ZnF5-WWE1-WWE2 from mouse PARP13 in complex with ADP-ribose and with ATP. ZnF5-WWE1-WWE2 crystallized as a dimer with major contacts formed between WWE1 and WWE2 originating from different monomers, indicative of a more compact monomeric arrangement of the tandem WWE domains. Solution scattering experiments and biophysical analysis indicated a monomer in solution, suggesting that the crystal dimer represents domain swapping that could potentially represent a PARP13 conformation assumed when signaling viral RNA detection. The crystal structure and binding studies demonstrate that WWE2 interacts with ADP-ribose and ATP, whereas WWE1 does not have a functional binding site. The shape of the WWE2 binding pocket disfavors interaction with the ribose-ribose linkage of poly(ADP-ribose). Binding studies with poly(ADP-ribose) ligands indicate that WWE2 serves as an anchor for preferential binding to the terminal end of poly(ADP-ribose), and the composite structure of ZnF5-WWE1-WWE2 forms an extended surface to engage polymer chains of ADP-ribose. This model represents a novel mode of poly(ADP-ribose) recognition and provides a structural framework for investigating poly(ADP-ribose) impact on PARP13 function.",

    "abstract": "Existence of a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer form with closer packing between monomers when receptor binding domains (RBDs) are all down, locked as opposed to closed, has been associated with linoleic acid (LA) binding at neutral pH, or can occur at acidic pH in the absence of LA binding. The relationship between degree of closure of the LA binding pocket of the RBD, and monomer burial in the trimer, is examined for a range of spike protein structures, including those with D614G mutation, and that of the Delta variant (which also carries D614G). Some spike protein structures with this aspartic acid mutation show monomer packing approaching that of the locked form (at neutral pH, without LA binding) for two segments, a third (around the RBD) remains less closely packed. Mutations in the RBD are a focus for the Omicron variant spike protein. Structure reports suggest that these mutations are involved in increased RBD-RBD interactions, and also that they could lead to a closing of the LA pocket, both of which could impact on pH-dependence. One potential outcome is that the extent of pH-dependent conformational transitions of the pre-fusion SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer are reduced in the Omicron variant.",

    "abstract": "Human behavior requires interregional crosstalk to employ the sensorimotor processes in the brain. Although some external neuromodulation tools have been used to manipulate interhemispheric sensorimotor activity, a central controversy concerns whether this activity can be volitionally controlled. Experimental tools lack the power to up- or down-regulate the state of the targeted hemisphere over a large dynamic range and, therefore, cannot evaluate the possible volitional control of the activity. We overcame this difficulty by using the recently developed method of spatially bivariate electroencephalography (EEG)-neurofeedback to systematically enable participants to manipulate their bilateral sensorimotor activities. Herein, we report that bi-directional changes in ipsilateral excitability to the imagined hand (conditioning hemisphere) affect interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) assessed by paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigm. In addition, participants were able to robustly manipulate the IHI magnitudes. Further physiological analyses revealed that the self-manipulation of IHI magnitude reflected interhemispheric connectivity in EEG and TMS, which was accompanied by intrinsic bilateral cortical oscillatory activities. Our results provide clear neuroscientific evidence regarding the inhibitory interhemispheric sensorimotor activity and IHI manipulator, thereby challenging the current theoretical concept of recovery of motor function for neurorehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Maternal immune activation (MIA) during prenatal development is an environmental risk factor for psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia (SZ). This link is particularly well established in the case of schizophrenia. Converging lines of evidence from human and animal model studies have suggested that elevated cytokine levels in the maternal and fetal compartments are an important indication of the mechanisms driving this association. However, there is variability in susceptibility to the psychiatric risk conferred by MIA, likely influenced by genetic factors. How MIA interacts with a genetic profile susceptible to SZ is challenging to test in animal models. To address this gap, we examined whether differential gene expression responses occur in forebrain-lineage neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) generated from three individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and three healthy controls. Following acute (24 hour) treatment with either interferon-gamma (IFN{gamma}; 25 ng/l) or interleukin (IL)-1{beta} (10 ng/l), we identified, by RNA sequencing, 3380 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the IFN{gamma}-treated control lines (compared to untreated controls), and 1980 DEGs in IFN{gamma}-treated SZ lines (compared to untreated SZ lines). Of these, 359 genes responded differently to IFN{gamma} treatment in SZ relative to control lines, which were enriched for genes differentially expressed in adult SZ cases and in pathways related to the regulation of antigen processing, neuronal post-synaptic density, and the presynapse. There were no differentially expressed genes in the IL-1{beta}-treatment conditions after Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Gene set enrichment analysis however showed that IL-1{beta} impacts immune function and neuronal differentiation. Collectively, our data suggest that a) SZ NPCs show an attenuated transcriptional response to IFN{gamma} treatment compared to control NPCs; b) IL-1{beta} may be less relevant to NPC cultures than IFN{gamma} and c) the genes differentially regulated in schizophrenia lines are primarily mitochondrial, loss-of-function, pre- and post-synaptic genes. Our findings particularly highlight early synaptic development as a key target for future research into the mechanisms of association between maternal immune activation and schizophrenia risk.\n\nHighlights* There is a significant transcriptional response to IFN{gamma} treatment in human induced cortical neural progenitor cells (NPCs)\n* Differential expression implicates mitochondrial complex genes in this IFN{gamma}-dependent response, which are underexpressed in response to treatment in schizophrenia (SZ) NPCs.\n* SZ NPCs do not upregulate pre- and post-synaptic genes in response to IFN{gamma} as much as control NPCs\n* IL-1{beta} may be less relevant to NPC cultures than IFN{gamma} due to low IL1 receptor expression in NPCs.",

    "abstract": "The prevailing model of protective immunity to tuberculosis is that CD4 T cells produce the cytokine IFN-{gamma} to activate bactericidal mechanisms in infected macrophages. Recent evidence has expanded this model, and it is now clear that CD4 T cells can control M. tuberculosis infection in the absence of IFN-{gamma} production. To identify factors and pathways involved in IFN-{gamma}-independent control, we developed a co-culture model using CD4 T cells isolated from the lungs of infected mice and M. tuberculosis-infected murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). We show that IFN-{gamma}-independent control is primarily mediated by CD4 T cell production of the cytokine GM-CSF and requires activation of the macrophage transcription factor HIF-1. HIF-1 activation drives a metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis and leads to the production of lipid droplets, both of which support host defense against infection. Surprisingly, recombinant GM-CSF is insufficient to rescue the absence of control by GM-CSF-deficient CD4 T cells during co-culture with BMDMs. In peritoneal macrophages, GM-CSF is sufficient to control growth, induces lipid droplet biogenesis, and requires HIF-1 expression for control. While HIF-1-mediated control following IFN-{gamma} stimulation requires nitric oxide, we find that HIF-1 activation by CD4 T cells and recombinant GM-CSF is nitric oxide-independent, implying a distinct pathway of activation. In addition to GM-CSF, CD4 T cells produce a factor that helps maintain phagosome membrane integrity during infection and blocks bacterial access to host lipids, a primary nutrient source. These results advance our understanding of CD4 T cell-mediated immunity to M. tuberculosis, clarify the role of nitric oxide as primarily immunomodulatory during M. tuberculosis infection, and reveal a novel mechanism for the activation of HIF-1. Furthermore, we establish a previously unknown functional link between GM-CSF and HIF-1 and provide evidence that CD4 T cell-derived GM-CSF is a potent bactericidal effector.",

    "abstract": "Transforming growth factor {beta} (TGF{beta}) is a morphogenic protein that augments antiviral immunity by altering the functional properties of pathogen-specific memory CD8 T cells. During infection TGF{beta} inhibits formation of effector (TEFF) and central memory CD8 T cells (TCM), while encouraging tissue-resident memory CD8 T cells (TRM) to settle in peripheral tissues. SMAD proteins are signaling intermediates that are used by members of the TGF cytokine family to modify gene expression. For this study, RNA-sequencing was used to explore how regulation via SMAD4 alters the transcriptional profile of antiviral CTLs during infection. We show that SMAD4 and TGF{beta} cooperatively regulate a collection of genes that determine whether specialized populations of pathogen-specific CTLs circulate around the body, or settle in peripheral tissue. The target genes include multiple homing receptors (CD103, KLRG1 and CD62L) and transcription factors (Hobit and EOMES) that support memory formation. While TGF{beta} uses a canonical SMAD-dependent signaling pathway to induce CD103 expression on TRM cells, an alternative SMAD4-dependent mechanism is required for formation of TEFF and TCM cells in the circulation.\n\nGraphical abstractTGF{beta} and SMAD4 modulate gene expression in reciprocal directions during differentiation of antiviral CTLs.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=132 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/472993v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5ac140org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@455a2aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1227d96org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16336b9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTHIV-1 integrase (IN) has a non-catalytic function in virion maturation through its binding to the viral RNA genome (gRNA). Allosteric integrase inhibitors (ALLINIs) and class II IN substitutions inhibit IN-gRNA binding and result in non-infectious viruses marked by mislocalization of the gRNA within virions. HIV-1 IN utilizes basic residues within its C-terminal domain (CTD) to bind to the gRNA. However, the molecular nature of how these residues mediate gRNA binding and whether other regions of IN are involved remain unknown. To address this, we have isolated compensatory substitutions in the background of a class II IN mutant virus bearing R269A/K273A substitutions within the IN-CTD. We found that the nearby D256N and D270N compensatory substitutions restored the ability of IN to bind gRNA and led to the formation of mature infectious virions. Reinstating the local positive charge of the IN-CTD through individual D256R, D256K, D278R and D279R substitutions was sufficient to restore IN-RNA binding and infectivity for the IN R269A/K273A as well as the IN R262A/R263A class II mutants. Structural modeling suggested that compensatory substitutions in the D256 residue created an additional interaction interface for gRNA binding. Finally, HIV-1 IN R269A/K273A, but not IN R262A/R263A, bearing compensatory mutations was more sensitive to ALLINIs providing key genetic evidence that specific IN residues required for RNA binding also influence ALLINI activity. Taken together, our findings highlight the essential role of CTD in gRNA binding and ALLINI sensitivity, and reveal the importance of pliable electrostatic interactions between the IN- CTD and the gRNA.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn addition to its catalytic function, HIV-1 integrase (IN) binds to the viral RNA genome (gRNA) through positively charged residues within its C-terminal domain (CTD) and regulates proper virion maturation. Here we show that compensatory mutations in nearby acidic residues (i.e. D256N and D270N) restore the ability to bind gRNA for IN variants bearing substitutions in these positively charged CTD residues. Similarly, charge reversals through individual D-to-R and D-to-K substitutions at these positions enabled the respective IN mutants to bind gRNA and restore virion infectivity. Further, we show that specific residues within the IN-CTD required for RNA binding also influence sensitivity to allosteric integrase inhibitors, a class of novel IN- targeting compounds that target the non-catalytic function of IN. Taken together, our findings reveal the importance of electrostatic interactions in IN-gRNA binding and provide key evidence for a crucial role of the IN-CTD in allosteric integrase inhibitor mechanism of action.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of bacteria is driven by random genetic mutations and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of genetic material from other bacteria. HGT can occur via transformation, transduction, and conjugation. Here, we present a potential new mechanism of HGT which occurs in a syntrophic Clostridium coculture. We have previously shown that in syntrophic cocultures of Clostridium acetobutylicum and Clostridium ljungdahlii, the two organisms undergo heterologous cell fusion, which includes fusion of the peptidoglycan cell walls and membranes. Heterologous cell fusion facilitated a large-scale exchange of cytoplasmic protein and RNA between the two organisms, leading to the formation of hybrid bacterial cells containing cytoplasmic material of the two parent organisms. Here we present new evidence that cell fusion events also facilitate the exchange of plasmid DNA between the two organisms of the syntrophic coculture. Through the use of a selective subculturing process, we successfully isolated wild-type C. acetobutylicum clones which have acquired a portion of the plasmid DNA - containing the antibiotic resistance marker - from a recombinant strain of C. ljungdahlii. Fusion events led to formation of persistent aberrant hybrid cells with distinct morphogenetic characteristics. Furthermore, our data support the concept of a novel, interspecies, mechanism of acquiring antibiotic resistance. Since neither organism contains any known conjugation machinery or mechanism, these findings expand our understanding of multi-species microbiomes, their survival strategies, and evolution.\n\nIMPORTANCEInvestigations of natural multispecies microbiomes and the field of synthetic and syntrophic microbial cocultures are attracting renewed interest based on their potential application in biotechnology, ecology, and medical fields. A variety of synthetic and natural cocultures have been examined in terms of their metabolic output, but relatively few systems have been interrogated at the cellular and molecular level. Previously, we have shown the syntrophic coculture of C. acetobutylicum and C. ljungdahlii undergoes heterologous cell-to-cell fusion, which facilitates the exchange of cytoplasmic protein and RNA between the two organisms, and leads to the formation of hybrid bacterial cells. Continuing this line of investigation, we now show that heterologous cell fusion between the two Clostridium organisms can also facilitate the exchange of DNA between the two organisms. By applying selective pressures to this coculture system, we isolated clones of wild-type C. acetobutylicum which acquired the erythromycin resistance (erm) gene from the C. ljungdahlii strain carrying a plasmid with the erm gene. Fusion led to persistent hybrid cells containing DNA from both parents but with distinct properties and morphologies. Moreover, we provide evidence for a novel mechanism of acquiring antibiotic resistance mediated by the syntrophic interactions of this system. This is a major finding that may shed light on a new mechanism of bacterias ability to acquire antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "In the context of the potential health hazards related to food processing, dietary emulsifiers have been shown to alter the structure and function of the gut microbial community, both in vivo and in vitro. In mouse models, these emulsifier exposed gut microbiota were shown to contribute to gut inflammation. Several knowledge gaps remain to be addressed though. As such, the impact from a longer timeframe of exposure on the gut microbiota is not known and interindividual variability in microbiome response needs to be measured.\n\nTo answer these research questions, in this study the faecal microbiota from two individuals, previously selected for high and low emulsifier sensitivity, were exposed to two concentrations of soy lecithin during a 7 day treatment phase in the dynamic mucosal simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (M-SHIME). The results showed mild effects from soy lecithin on the composition and functionality of these microbial communities, which depended on the original microbial composition. The effects also mostly levelled off after 3 days of exposure. The emulsifier sensitivity for which the microbiota were selected, was preserved. Some potentially concerning effects were also registered: butyrate levels, positively correlating with Faecalibacterium abundance, were lowered by soy lecithin. Also the abundance of the beneficial Bifidobacterium genus was lowered, while the abundance of the notorious unclassified Enterobacteriaceae was increased. Within the family of the unclassified Lachnospiraceae, several genera were either suppressed or stimulated.\n\nThe effects that these microbial alterations would have on a living host is not yet certain, especially given the fact that large fractions of soy lecithins constituents can be absorbed. Nevertheless, choline and phosphatidylcholine, both primary and absorbable constituents of soy lecithin, have recently been linked to cardiovascular disease via the generation of TMA by the gut microbiota. Further studies that validate our findings and link them to potential health outcomes are thus justified.",

    "abstract": "Plant-pathogenic fungi span diverse taxonomic lineages. Their host-infection strategies are often specialised and require the coordinated regulation of molecular virulence factors. Transcription factors (TFs) are fundamental regulators of gene expression, controlling development and virulence in plant pathogenic fungi. Recent research has established regulatory roles for several taxonomically conserved fungal TFs, but the evolution of specific virulence regulators is not well understood. This study sought to explore the representation of TFs across a taxonomically-diverse range of fungi, with a focus on plant pathogens. A significant trend was observed among the obligate, host-associated pathogens, which possess a reduced overall TF repertoire, alluding to a lack of pressure for maintaining diversity. A novel orthology-based analysis is then presented that refined TF classifications, traditionally based on the nature of the DNA-binding domains. Using this analysis, cases of TF over/underrepresentation across fungal pathogen lineages are systematically highlighted. Specific examples are then explored and discussed that included the TF orthologues of Ste12, Pf2 and EBR1, plus phytotoxic secondary-metabolite cluster regulators, which all presented novel and distinct evolutionary insights. Ultimately, as the examples presented demonstrate, this resource can be interrogated to guide functional studies that seek to characterise virulence-specific regulators and shed light on the factors underpinning plant pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "The establishment of centromere-specific CENP-A chromatin is influenced by epigenetic and genetic processes. Central domain sequences from fission yeast centromeres are preferred substrates for CENP-ACnp1 incorporation, but their use is context dependent, requiring adjacent heterochromatin. CENP-ACnp1 overexpression bypasses heterochromatin dependency, suggesting heterochromatin ensures exposure to conditions or locations permissive for CENP-ACnp1 assembly. Centromeres cluster around spindle-pole bodies (SPBs). We show that heterochromatin-bearing minichromosomes localize close to SPBs, consistent with this location promoting CENP-ACnp1 incorporation. We demonstrate that heterochromatin-independent de novo CENP-ACnp1 chromatin assembly occurs when central domain DNA is placed near, but not far from, endogenous centromeres or neocentromeres. Moreover, direct tethering of central domain DNA at SPBs permits CENP-ACnp1 assembly, suggesting that the nuclear compartment surrounding SPBs is permissive for CENP-ACnp1 incorporation because target sequences are exposed to high levels of CENP-ACnp1 and associated assembly factors. Thus, nuclear spatial organization is a key epigenetic factor that influences centromere identity.",

    "abstract": "Specific gene transcriptional programs are required to ensure proper proliferation and differentiation processes underlying the production of specialized cells during development. Gene activity is mainly regulated by the concerted action of transcription factors and chromatin proteins. In the nematode C. elegans, mechanisms that silence improper transcriptional programs in germline and somatic cells have been well studied, however, how are tissue specific sets of genes turned on is less known. LSL-1 is herein defined as a novel crucial transcriptional regulator of germline genes in C. elegans. LSL-1 is first detected in the P4 blastomere and remains present at all stages of germline development, from primordial germ cell proliferation to the end of meiotic prophase. lsl-1 loss-of-function mutants exhibit many defects including meiotic prophase progression delay, a high level of germline apoptosis, and production of almost no functional gametes. Transcriptomic analysis and ChIP-seq data show that LSL-1 binds to promoters and acts as a transcriptional activator of germline genes involved in various processes, including homologous chromosome pairing, recombination, and genome stability. Furthermore, we show that LSL-1 functions by antagonizing the action of the heterochromatin proteins HPL-2/HP1 and LET-418/Mi2 known to be involved in the repression of germline genes in somatic cells. Based on our results, we propose LSL-1 to be a major regulator of the germline transcriptional program during development.",

    "abstract": "Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) particularly Alzheimers disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are increasing; however, mechanisms driving cerebrovascular decline are poorly understood. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a critical enzyme in the folate and methionine cycles. Variants in MTHFR, notably 677C>T, are associated with dementias, but no mouse model existed to identify mechanisms by which MTHFR677C>T increases risk. Therefore, MODEL-AD created a novel knock-in (KI) strain carrying the Mthfr677C>T allele on the C57BL/6J background (Mthfr677C>T) to characterize morphology and function perturbed by the variant. Consistent with human clinical data, Mthfr677C>T mice have reduced enzyme activity in the liver and elevated plasma homocysteine levels. MTHFR enzyme activity as well as critical metabolites in the folate and methionine cycles are reduced in the Mthfr677C>T brain. Mice showed reduced tissue perfusion in numerous brain regions by PET/CT as well as significantly reduced vascular density and increased GFAP-expressing astrocytes in frontal cortex. Electron microscopy revealed cerebrovascular damage including endothelial and pericyte apoptosis, reduced luminal size, and increased astrocyte and microglial presence in the microenvironment. Collectively, these data suggest critical perturbations to cerebrovascular function in Mthfr677C>T mice supporting its use as a model for preclinical studies of VCID.",

    "abstract": "Telomere replication and regulation protect mammalian chromosome ends and promote genome stability. An essential step in telomere maintenance is the C-strand fill-in process, which is the de novo synthesis of the complementary strand of the telomere overhang. This step is catalyzed by polymerase-alpha/primase complex (pol-/primase) and coordinated by an accessory factor, CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST). Using cryogenic-electron microscopy single-particle analysis, we report the structure of the human telomere C-strand fill-in preinitiation complex (PIC) at 3.9 [A] resolution. The structure reveals a CST and a pol-/primase co-bound to a single telomere overhang, poised for de novo RNA primer synthesis. Upon PIC assembly, the pol-/primase undergoes large conformation change from its apo-state; CST partitions the DNA and RNA catalytic centers of pol-/primase into two separate domains and positions the 3' end of an extended telomere single-stranded DNA template towards the RNA catalytic center (PRIM1 or p49). The telomeric single-stranded DNA template is further positioned by the POLA1 (or p180) catalytically dead exonuclease domain. Together with CST, the exonuclease domain forms a tight-fit molecular tunnel for template direction. Given the structural homology of CST to Replication Protein A (RPA), our structure provides the structural basis for a new model of how pol-/primase lagging-strand DNA synthesis is coordinated by single-stranded DNA-binding accessory factors.",

    "abstract": "SKD3, also known as human CLPB, belongs to the AAA+ family of ATPases associated with various activities. Mutations in the SKD3/CLPB gene cause 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type VII and congenital neutropenia. SKD3 is upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia, where it contributes to anti-cancer drug resistance. SKD3 resides in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it forms ATP-dependent high-molecular weight complexes, but its biological function and mechanistic links to the clinical phenotypes are currently unknown. Using sedimentation equilibrium and dynamic light scattering, we show that SKD3 is monomeric at low protein concentration in the absence of nucleotides, but it forms oligomers at higher protein concentration or in the presence of adenine nucleotides. The apparent molecular weight of the nucleotide-bound SKD3 is consistent with self-association of 12 monomers. Image-class analysis and averaging from negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) of SKD3 in the ATP-bound state visualized cylinder-shaped particles with an open central channel along the cylinder axis. The dimensions of the EM-visualized particle suggest that the SKD3 dodecamer is formed by association of two hexameric rings. While hexameric structure has been often observed among AAA+ ATPases, a double-hexamer sandwich found for SKD3 appears uncommon within this protein family. A functional significance of the non-canonical structure of SKD3 remains to be determined.",

    "abstract": "The microbiota generates diverse metabolites that can engage multiple pathways to modulate host physiology and disease, but their protein targets and mechanism(s) of action have not been fully elucidated. To address this challenge, we focused on indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a prominent microbiota metabolite, and developed IAA-based chemical reporters for proteomic studies. We discovered that IAA interacts with many proteins in host cells, including small-molecule transporters, receptors and metabolic enzymes. Notably, our functional studies revealed that IAA binds to orphan G protein-coupled receptors such as GPRC5A, but only aromatic monoamines were capable of inducing GPRC5A signaling. Functional profiling of microbiota uncovered specific bacterial species and enzymes that generate GPRC5A agonists. Finally, biochemical characterization of GPRC5A activation identified more potent synthetic agonists as well as key amino acid residues involved in ligand binding. These studies highlight the utility of chemoproteomics to dissect protein targets and mechanisms of action for microbiota metabolites.",

    "abstract": "StatementThe enrichment analysis of discriminative cell transcriptional responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection using biclustering produces a broader set of superiorly enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways against alternative state-of-the-art machine learning approaches, unraveling novel knowledge.\n\nMotivation and methodsThe comprehensive understanding of the impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on infected cells is still incomplete. This work identifies and analyses the main cell regulatory processes affected and induced by SARS-CoV-2, using transcriptomic data from several infectable cell lines available in public databases and in vivo samples. We propose a new class of statistical models to handle three major challenges, namely the scarcity of observations, the high dimensionality of the data, and the complexity of the interactions between genes. Additionally, we analyse the function of these genes and their interactions within cells to compare them to ones affected by IAV (H1N1), RSV and HPIV3 in the target cell lines.\n\nResultsGathered results show that, although clustering and predictive algorithms aid classic functional enrichment analysis, recent pattern-based biclustering algorithms significantly improve the number and quality of the detected biological processes. Additionally, a comparative analysis of these processes is performed to identify potential pathophysiological characteristics of COVID-19. These are further compared to those identified by other authors for the same virus as well as related ones such as SARS-CoV-1. This approach is particularly relevant due to a lack of other works utilizing more complex machine learning tools within this context.",

However, few information is provided about GAGs composition or potential implication in TAA pathology. Syndecan-1 (Sdc-1) is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is implicated in extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction and assembly, regulation of SMCs phenotype and various aspects of inflammation in the vascular wall. In the current work, the regulation of Sdc-1 protein was examined in human TAA by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. In addition, the role of Sdc-1 was evaluated in descending TAA in vivo using a mouse model combining both aortic wall weakening and hypertension. Our results showed that Sdc-1 protein is over expressed in human TAA aortas compared to healthy counterparts and that SMCs are the major cell type expressing Sdc-1. Similarly, in the mouse model used, Sdc-1 expression was increased in TAA aortas compared to healthy samples. Although its protective role against abdominal aneurysm has been reported, we observed that Sdc-1 was dispensable for TAA prevalence or rupture. In addition, Sdc-1 deficiency did not alter the extent of aortic wall dilatation, elastin degradation, collagen deposition, or leukocyte recruitment in our TAA model. These findings suggest that Sdc-1 could be a biomarker revealing TAA pathology. Future investigations could uncover the underlying mechanisms leading to Sdc-1 expression alteration in TAA.",

PCC 7120 (Anabaena) represents multicellular organisms capable of simultaneously performing oxygenic photosynthesis in vegetative cells and the O2-sensitive N2-fixation inside the heterocysts. The flavodiiron proteins (FDPs) have been shown to participate in photoprotection of photosynthesis by driving excess electrons to O2 (Mehler-like reaction). Here, we addressed the physiological relevance of the vegetative cell-specific Flv1A and Flv3A on the bioenergetic processes occurring in diazotrophic Anabaena under variable CO2. We demonstrate that both Flv1A and Flv3A are required for proper induction of the Mehler-like reaction upon a sudden increase in light intensity, which is likely important for the activation of carbon-concentrating mechanisms (CCM) and CO2 fixation. Under ambient CO2 diazotrophic conditions, Flv3A is capable of mediating moderate O2 photoreduction, independently of Flv1A, but in coordination with Flv2 and Flv4. Strikingly, the lack of Flv3A resulted in strong downregulation of the heterocyst-specific uptake hydrogenase, which led to enhanced H2 photoproduction under both oxic and micro-oxic conditions. These results reveal a novel regulatory network between the Mehler-like reaction and the diazotrophic metabolism, which is of great interest for future biotechnological applications.",

The SMBT has been used to assess upper-body power in various populations and to establish concurrent validity for other measures of upper-body power such as the bench press power test and the plyometric push-up. The SMBT is less costly and simpler to incorporate into a field test battery than other upper body power assessments.

Here we provide evidence that the cell adhesion molecule, NrCAM, regulates tanycytes in the adult niche. NrCAM is strongly expressed in adult mouse tanycytes. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization analysis revealed that NrCAM loss of function leads to both a reduced number of tanycytes and reduced expression of tanycyte-specific cell markers, along with a small reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive arcuate neurons. Similar analyses of NrCAM mutants at E16 identify few changes in gene expression or cell composition, indicating that NrCAM regulates tanycytes, rather than early embryonic hypothalamic development. Neurosphere and organotypic assays support the idea that NrCAM governs cellular homeostasis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) shows that tanycyte-specific genes, including a number that are implicated in thyroid hormone metabolism, show reduced expression in the mutant mouse. However, the mild tanycyte depletion and loss of markers observed in NrCAM-deficient mice were associated with only a subtle metabolic phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Post-stroke infection is a common complication of stroke that is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. We previously found that experimental stroke induces an ablation of multiple sub-populations of B cells and reduced levels of IgM antibody that coincide with the development of spontaneous bacterial pneumonia. Reduced circulating IgM concentrations were also observed in acute stroke patients. The loss of IgM antibody after stroke could be an important determinant of infection susceptibility and highlights this pathway as an important target for intervention.\n\nWe treated mice with a low (replacement), dose of IgM-enriched intravenous immunoglobulin (IgM-IVIg) prior to and 24 h after experimental stroke induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or sham surgery, then recovered mice for 2 d or 5 d. The effect of treatment on lung bacterial burden, lung pathology, brain infarct volume, antibody levels and both lung and systemic cellular and cytokine immune profiles was determined. Treatment with IgM-IVIg enhanced bacterial clearance from the lung after MCAO and improved pathology but did not impact infarct volume. IgM-IVIg treatment induced immunomodulatory effects systemically including rescue of splenic plasma B cell numbers and endogenous mouse IgM and IgA circulating immunoglobulin concentrations that were reduced by MCAO, and treatment also reduced concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung. The effects of MCAO and IgM-IVIg treatment on the immune system were tissue specific as no impact on B cells or mouse immunoglobulins were found within the lung. However, the presence of human immunoglobulins from the IgM-IVIg treatment led to increased total lung immunoglobulin concentration. IgM-IVIg treatment did not increase the number of lung mononuclear phagocytes or directly modulate macrophage phagocytic capacity but enhanced their capability to phagocytose Staphylococcus aureus bioparticles in vitro by increasing opsonisation.\n\nLow dose IgM-IVIg contributes to increased clearance of spontaneous lung bacteria after MCAO likely via increasing availability of antibody in the lung to enhance phagocytic activity. Immunomodulatory effects of IgM-IVIg treatment, including reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production, may also contribute to reduced levels of damage in the lung after MCAO. IgM-IVIg shows promise as an antibacterial and immunomodulatory agent to use in the treatment of post-stroke infection.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=141 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/472965v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c8684forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@384688org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9eb7f7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3fe58e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Using a panel of engineered lipooligosaccharides (LOS) derived from Yersinia pestis with defined lipid A structures that vary in their acylation or phosphorylation state, we identified that differences in phosphorylation state did not affect TLR4 or CASP4/5 activation. However, the acylation state differentially impacted TLR4 and CASP4/5 activation. Specifically, all of the examined tetra-, penta-, and hexa-acylated LOS variants activated CASP4/5-dependent responses, whereas TLR4 responded to penta- and hexa-acylated LOS but did not respond to tetra-acylated LOS or pentaacylated LOS lacking the secondary acyl chain at the 3 position. As expected, lipid A alone was sufficient for TLR4 activation; however, human macrophages required both lipid A and the core oligosaccharide to mount a robust CASP4/5 inflammasome response. Our findings show that human TLR4 and CASP4/5 detect both shared and non-overlapping LOS/lipid A structures, which enables the innate immune system to recognize a wider range of bacterial LOS/lipid A, thereby constraining the ability of pathogens to evade innate immune detection.",

    "abstract": "The complex interactions between gut microbiome and host or pathogen colonization resistance cannot solely be understood from community composition. Missing are causal relationships such as metabolic interactions among species to better understand what shapes the microbiome. Here, we focused on metabolic niches generated and occupied by the Oligo-Mouse-Microbiota consortium, a synthetic community composed of 12 members that is increasingly used as a model for the mouse gut microbiome. Combining mono-cultures and spent medium experiments with untargeted metabolomics uncovered broad metabolic diversity in the consortium, constituting a dense cross-feeding network with more than 100 pairwise interactions. Quantitative analysis of the cross-feeding network revealed distinct C and N food webs that highlight the two Bacteroidetes consortium members B. caecimuris and M. intestinale as primary suppliers of carbon, and a more diverse group as nitrogen providers. Cross-fed metabolites were mainly carboxylic acids, amino acids, and the so far not reported nucleobases. In particular the dicarboxylic acids malate and fumarate provided a strong physiological benefit to consumers, presumably as anaerobic electron acceptors. Isotopic tracer experiments validated the fate of a subset of cross-fed metabolites, in particular the conversion of the most abundant cross-fed compound succinate to butyrate. Thus, we show that this consortium is tailored to produce the anti-inflammatory metabolite butyrate. Overall, we provide evidence for metabolic niches generated and occupied by OMM members that lays a metabolic foundation to facilitate understanding of the more complex in vivo behavior of this consortium in the mouse gut.\n\nImportanceThis article maps out the cross-feeding network amongst 10 members of a synthetic consortium that is increasingly used as the model mouse gut microbiota. Combining metabolomics with in vitro cultivations, two dense networks of carbon and nitrogen exchange are described. The vast majority of the about 100 interactions are synergistic in nature, in several cases providing distinct physiological benefits to the recipient species. These networks lay the ground work towards understanding gut community dynamics and host-gut microbe interactions.",

    "abstract": "In 2016, a 68-year-old patient with a disseminated multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infection was treated using lytic bacteriophages in one of the first modern human clinical uses of phage therapy in the United States. Due to the emergency nature of the treatment there was little time to thoroughly characterize the phages used in this intervention or the pathogen itself. Here we report the genomes of the nine phages used for treatment and three strains of A. baumannii isolated prior to and during treatment. The eight phages used in the initial treatment were found to be a group of closely related T4-like myophages; the ninth phage, AbTP3{Phi}1, was found to be an unrelated Fri1-like podophage. Analysis of 19 A. baumannii isolates collected before and during phage treatment showed that resistance to the T4-like phages appeared as early as two days following the start of treatment. Three A. baumannii strains (TP1, TP2 and TP3) collected before and during treatment were sequenced to closure, and all contained a 3.9 Mb chromosome of sequence type 570 with a KL116 capsule locus and identical 8.7 kb plasmids. Phage-insensitive mutants of A. baumannii strain TP1 were generated in vitro and the majority of identified mutations were located in the bacterial capsule locus. The presence of the same mutation in both the in vitro mutants and in phage-insensitive isolates TP2 and TP3, which evolved in vivo during phage treatment, indicate that in vitro investigations can produce results that are relevant and predictive for the in vivo environment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAcute kidney injury (AKI) occurs frequently in critically ill patients and is associated with adverse outcomes. Cellular mechanisms underlying AKI and kidney cell responses to injury remain incompletely understood.\n\nMethodsWe performed single-nuclei transcriptomics, bulk transcriptomics, molecular imaging studies, and conventional histology on kidney tissues from 8 individuals with severe AKI (stage 2 or 3 according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria). Specimens were obtained within 1-2 hours after individuals had succumbed to critical illness associated with respiratory infections, with 4 of 8 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19. Control kidney tissues were obtained post-mortem or after nephrectomy from individuals without AKI.\n\nResultsHigh-depth single cell-resolved gene expression data of human kidneys affected by AKI revealed enrichment of novel injury-associated cell states within the major cell types of the tubular epithelium, in particular in proximal tubules, thick ascending limbs and distal convoluted tubules. Four distinct, hierarchically interconnected injured cell states were distinguishable and characterized by transcriptome patterns associated with oxidative stress, hypoxia, interferon response, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, respectively. Transcriptome differences between individuals with AKI were driven primarily by the cell type-specific abundance of these four injury subtypes rather than by private molecular responses. AKI-associated changes in gene expression between individuals with and without COVID-19 were similar.\n\nConclusionThe study provides an extensive resource of the cell type-specific transcriptomic responses associated with critical illness-associated AKI in humans, highlighting recurrent disease-associated signatures and inter-individual heterogeneity. Personalized molecular disease assessment in human AKI may foster the development of tailored therapies.",

    "abstract": "N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a highly prevalent mRNA modification which promotes degradation of transcripts encoding proteins that have roles in cell development, differentiation, and other pathways. METTL3 is the major methyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of m6A in mRNA. As 30-80% of m6A can remain in mRNA after METTL3 depletion by CRISPR/Cas9-based methods, other enzymes are thought to catalyze a sizable fraction of m6A. Here, we re-examined the source of m6A in the mRNA transcriptome. We characterized mouse embryonic stem cell lines which continue to have m6A in their mRNA after Mettl3 knockout. We show that these cells express alternatively spliced Mettl3 transcript isoforms that bypass the CRISPR/Cas9 mutations and produce functionally active methyltransferases. We similarly show that other reported METTL3 knockout cell lines express altered METTL3 proteins. We find that gene dependency datasets show that most cell lines fail to proliferate after METTL3 deletion, suggesting that reported METTL3 knockout cell lines express altered METTL3 proteins rather than have full knockout. Finally, we reassessed METTL3s role in synthesizing m6A using a genomic deletion of Mettl3, and found that METTL3 is responsible for >95% of m6A in mRNA. Overall, these studies suggest that METTL3 is responsible for the vast majority of m6A in the transcriptome, and that remaining m6A in putative METTL3 knockout cell lines is due to the expression of altered but functional METTL3 isoforms.",

Previous studies addressed how fission yeast Rap1 contributes to telomere length maintenance, but the mechanism by which the protein inhibits end fusions has remained elusive. Here, we use a genetic screen in combination with high throughput sequencing to identify several amino acid positions in Rap1 that have a key role in end protection. Interestingly, mutations at these sites render cells susceptible to genome instability in a conditional manner with longer telomeres being prone to undergoing end fusions, while short telomeres are sufficiently protected. The protection of long telomeres requires their nuclear envelope attachment mediated by the Rap1-Bqt4 interaction. Our data demonstrates that longer telomeres pose an additional challenge for the maintenance of genome integrity and provides an explanation for a species-specific upper limit in telomere length.",

    "abstract": "Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) is a multidomain protein of retroviral origin with a vital role in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and memory formation in mammals. However, the mechanistic and structural basis of Arc function is little understood. Arc has an NTD involved in membrane binding and a CTD which binds postsynaptic protein ligands. In addition, the NTD and CTD both function in Arc oligomerization, including assembly of retrovirus-like capsid involved in intercellular signaling. We produced and characterised six ultra-high-affinity anti-Arc nanobodies (Nb). The CTD of both rat and human Arc could be crystallised in ternary complexes with two Nbs simultaneously bound (H11 and C11). H11 binding deep into the stargazing-binding pocket of Arc CTD suggested competitive binding with Arc ligand peptides, which was confirmed in vitro. This indicates that the H11 Nb could serve as a genetically-encoded tool for inhibition of endogenous Arc N-lobe interactions in study of neuronal function and plasticity. The crystallisation of the human Arc CTD in two different conformations, accompanied by SAXS data and molecular dynamics simulations, paints a dynamic picture of the mammalian Arc CTD. Dynamics were affected by mutations known to inhibit capsid formation, implying a role for Arc CTD dynamics in oligomerisation. Dimerisation of the NTD, together with structural dynamics of the CTD, suggest a mechanism, by which structural dynamics of the CTD may promote capsomer formation, and dimerisation of the NTD links capsomers, facilitating the formation of capsids. The described recombinant ultrahigh-affinity anti-Arc Nbs are versatile tools that can be further developed for studying mammalian Arc structure and function in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Complex cellular processes are driven by the regulated assembly and disassembly of large multi-protein complexes. In eukaryotic DNA replication, whilst we are beginning to understand the molecular mechanism for assembly of the replication machinery (replisome), we still know relatively little about the regulation of its disassembly at replication termination. Over recent years, the first elements of this process have emerged, revealing that the replicative helicase, at the heart of the replisome, is polyubiquitylated prior to unloading and that this unloading requires p97 segregase activity. Two different E3 ubiquitin ligases are now known to ubiquitylate the helicase under different conditions: Cul2Lrr1 and TRAIP. Here we have found two p97 cofactors, Ubxn7 and Faf1, which can interact with p97 during replisome disassembly in S-phase. Only Ubxn7 however facilitates efficient replisome disassembly through its interaction with both Cul2Lrr1 and p97. Our data therefore characterise Ubxn7 as the first substrate-specific p97 cofactor regulating replisome disassembly in vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "In the past few decades, public repositories on nucleotides have increased with exponential rates. This pose a major challenge to researchers to predict the structure and function of nucleotide sequences. In order to annotate function of nucleotide sequences it is important to compute features/attributes for predicting function of these sequences using machine learning techniques. In last two decades, several software/platforms have been developed to elicit a wide range of features for nucleotide sequences. In order to complement the existing methods, here we present a platform named Nfeature developed for computing wide range of features of DNA and RNA sequences. It comprises of three major modules namely Composition, Correlation, and Binary profiles. Composition module allow to compute different type of compositions that includes mono-/di-tri-nucleotide composition, reverse complement composition, pseudo composition. Correlation module allow to compute various type of correlations that includes auto-correlation, cross-correlation, pseudo-correlation. Similarly, binary profile is developed for computing binary profile based on nucleotides, mono-nucleotides, di-/tri-nucleotide properties. Nfeature also allow to compute entropy of sequences, repeats in sequences and distribution of nucleotides in sequences. In addition to compute feature in whole sequence, it also allows to compute features from part of sequence like split, start, end, and rest. In a nutshell, Nfeature amalgamates existing features as well as number of novel features like nucleotide repeat index, distance distribution, entropy, binary profile, and properties. This tool computes a total of 29217 and 14385 features for DNA and RNA sequence, respectively. In order to provide, a highly efficient and userfriendly tool, we have developed a standalone package and web-based platform (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/nfeature).",

Here, we use single-molecule imaging techniques to resolve the spatial position and temporal duration of each pMHC:TCR molecular binding event while simultaneously monitoring LAT condensation at the membrane. An individual binding event is sufficient to trigger a LAT condensate, which is self-limiting, and neither its size nor lifetime is correlated with the duration of the originating pMHC:TCR binding event. Only the probability of the LAT condensate forming is related to the pMHC:TCR binding dwell time. LAT condenses abruptly, but after an extended delay from the originating binding event. A LAT mutation that facilitates phosphorylation at the PLC-{gamma}1 recruitment site shortens the delay time to LAT condensation and alters T cell antigen specificity. These results identify a role for the LAT protein condensation phase transition in setting antigen discrimination thresholds in T cells.",

The HCV envelope E1 and E2 glycoproteins are essential for viral entry and infection, and comprise the primary antigenic target for neutralizing antibody responses. The molecular mechanisms of E1E2 assembly, as well as how the E1E2 heterodimer binds broadly neutralizing antibodies, remains elusive. We present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of the membrane-extracted full-length E1E2 heterodimer in complex with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) AR4A, AT12009 and IGH505 at [~]3.5 [A] resolution. We resolve the long sought-after interface between the E1 and E2 ectodomains and reveal how it is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and glycans. This structure deepens our understanding of the HCV fusion glycoprotein and delivers a blueprint for the rational design of novel vaccine immunogens and anti-viral drugs.",

    "abstract": "A large knowledge gap exists regarding the disease profile and pathologic condition of the invasive, non-native, slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata. To help address this, we performed a yearlong health survey across two sites in South Wales UK - subtidal Swansea Bay and intertidal Milford Haven. In total, 1,800 limpets were screened systematically for haemolymph bacterial burdens using both general and vibrio-selective growth media (TSA +2% NaCl and TCBS, respectively), haemolymph (blood) inspection using microscopy, a PCR-based assay targeting Vibrio spp., and multi-tissue histology. Over 99% of haemolymph samples contained cultivable bacterial colony forming units, and 83% of limpets tested positive for the presence of vibrios via PCR (confirmed via Sanger sequencing). Vibrio presence did not vary greatly across sites, yet a strong temporal (seasonal) effect was observed - significantly higher bacterial loads during the summer. Binomial logistic regression models revealed larger (older) limpets were more likely to harbour vibrios, and the growth of bacteria on TCBS was a key predictor for PCR-based vibrio detection. Histological assessment of >340 animals revealed little evidence of inflammation, sepsis, or immune reactivity despite the gross bacterial numbers. We contend that slipper limpets are not susceptible to bacteriosis at either site surveyed, or do not to harbour vibrios known to be pathogenic to humans. The lack of susceptibility to local pathogenic bacteria may explain, in part, the invasion success of C. fornicata across this region.",

    "abstract": "Dysimmune and Inflammatory Myopathies (DIMs) are acquired idiopathic myopathy associated with immune response dysregulation. Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), the most common DIMs, is characterized by endomysial infiltrates of cytotoxic T lymphocytes CD8, muscle type II-interferon (IFN{gamma}) signature, and by the lack of response to immunomodulatory therapies. We showed that IBM was pathologically characterized by the presence of chronic degenerative myopathic features including myofiber atrophy, fibrosis, adipose involution, and the altered functions of skeletal muscle stem cells. Here, we demonstrated that protracted systemic exposure to IFN{gamma} delayed muscle regeneration and led to IBM-like muscular degenerative changes in mice. In vitro, IFN{gamma} treatment inhibited the activation, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and fusion of myogenic progenitor cells and promoted their senescence through JAK-STAT-dependent activation. Finally, JAK-STAT inhibitor, ruxolitinib abrogated the deleterious effects of IFN{gamma} on muscle regeneration, suggesting that the JAK-STAT pathway could represent a new therapeutic target for IBM.",

COVID-19 has rapidly propagated in the world in the past 2 years, causing a global pandemic. Here, we performed proteomic analysis of plasma samples from COVID-19 patients compared to healthy control donors in an exploratory study to gain insights into protein-level changes in the patients caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and to identify potential proteomic and posttranslational signatures of this disease. Our results suggest a global change in protein processing and regulation that occurs in response to SARS-CoV-2, and the existence of a posttranslational COVID-19 signature that includes an elevation in threonine phosphorylation, a change in glycosylation, and a decrease in arginylation, an emerging posttranslational modification not previously implicated in infectious disease. This study provides a resource for COVID-19 researchers and, longer term, will inform our understanding of this disease and its treatment.\n\nKey PointsO_LIPlasma from COVID-19 patients exhibits prominent protein- and peptide-level changes\nC_LIO_LIProteins from COVID-19 patient plasma exhibit prominent changes in several key posttranslational modifications\nC_LI",

Here we report the systematic simulation of the interactions of 100 mammalian PH domains with PIP containing model membranes. Comparison with crystal structures of PH domains bound to PIP analogues demonstrates that our method correctly identifies interactions at known canonical and non-canonical sites, while revealing additional functionally important sites for interaction not observed in the crystal structure, such as for P-Rex1 and Akt1. At the family level, we find that the {beta}1 and {beta}2 strands and their connecting loop constitute the primary PIP interaction site for the majority of PH domains, but we highlight interesting exceptional cases. Simultaneous interaction with multiple PIPs and clustering of PIPs induced by PH domain binding are also observed. Our findings support a general paradigm for PH domain membrane association involving multivalent interactions with anionic lipids.\n\nTeaserSimulating the binding of 100 Pleckstrin homology domains to cell membranes reveals patterns in their lipid interactions.",

    "abstract": "With the global decline of freshwater fishes, quantifying the body size-specific habitat use of vulnerable species is crucial for accurately evaluating population health, identifying the effects of anthropogenic stressors, and directing effective habitat restoration. Populations of New Zealands endemic k[o]kopu species (Galaxias fasciatus, G. argenteus, and G. postvectis) have declined substantially over the last century in response to anthropogenic stressors, including habitat loss and fragmentation, invasive species, and over-exploitation. Despite well-understood habitat associations, key within-habitat features driving the reach-scale biomass of small and large k[o]kopu remain unclear. Here, we investigated whether the total biomass of small ([&le;] 90 mm) and large (> 90 mm) k[o]kopu was associated with total pool area, average pool depth, total bank cover, average substrate size, and average forest canopy cover across fifty-seven 50 m reaches. These features were selected because generally pool habitats are productive feeding areas, bank cover and substrate interstices are important refuges, and forest cover provides greater food availability. Because k[o]kopu are nocturnal, populations were sampled with removal at night using headlamps and hand-nets until reaches were visually depleted. Using Akaikes information criterion, it was found that increases in large k[o]kopu biomass were most parsimoniously explained by greater pool area and bank cover, whereas increases in small k[o]kopu biomass were best explained by low bank cover and greater average forest cover. This study demonstrated the importance of considering the ontogenetic shift in species habitat use and provided an effective modelling approach for quantifying the size-specific habitat use of these stream-dwelling fish.",

    "abstract": "The main objective of this research was to explore the dynamic changes of Bifidobacterium and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the process of feed fermentation under anaerobic condition, so as to increase the number of fermented bacteria of Bifidobacterium from the aspect of strain combination. The results showed that when Bifidobacterium lactis (B. lactis, i.e. Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis) fermented with Bacillus coagulans or Lactobacillus paracasei, the maximum number of B. lactis in those samples was 9.42 times and 4.64 times of that of fermented sample with B. lactis only. The soybean meal was fermented by B. lactis, L. paracasei and B. coagulans, and the number of B. lactis reached the maximum after fermented 10 days, which was 6.13 times of that in unfermented sample. The reducing sugar content and highest activity of -galactosidase were higher than the control. These results suggest that B. coagulans and L. paracasei can promote the growth of B. lactis. It is inferred that B. coagulans can metabolize normally in aerobic, micro-aerobic and anaerobic environments, consume oxygen, produce digestive enzymes, and cooperate with L. paracasei to produce metabolic products benefit for the growth of B. lactis.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress breeds various chronic lifestyle ailments including inflammatory conditions and neurodegenerative diseases. {beta}-caryophyllene natural bicyclic sesquiterpene, obtained from various plants sources found to be effective against inflammation and neuroprotection. In this study, we have evaluated the protective effect of Viphyllin, a standardized extract of {beta}-caryophyllene from black pepper against inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide in RAW264.7 macrophage cells and mechanisms involved in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-challenged oxidative stress in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Viphyllin demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity by subsiding the release of the pro-inflammatory intermediaries like NO, cytokines, interleukins, and protein expression levels of cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). In addition, Viphyllin suppressed the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. On the other hand, Viphyllin showed neuroprotective effect against neuronal oxidative damage caused by H2O2. Viphyllin lessened the expression B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X protein (BAX), cleaved caspase-9, and PARP-1 proteins associated with apoptosis. Our results indicate that Viphyllin ameliorated LPS-mediated inflammation in macrophages by regulating inflammation and Viphyllin exerted remarkable anti apoptotic effect against neuronal damage challenged by H2O2. Altogether, Viphyllin could be potential functional food ingredient for inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The meaning of words in natural language depends crucially on context. However, most neuroimaging studies of word meaning use isolated words and isolated sentences with little context. Because the brain may process natural language differently from how it processes simplified stimuli, there is a pressing need to determine whether prior results on word meaning generalize to natural language. fMRI was used to record human brain activity while four subjects (two female) read words in four conditions that vary in context: narratives, isolated sentences, blocks of semantically similar words, and isolated words. We then compared the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of evoked brain responses, and we used a voxelwise encoding modeling approach to compare the representation of semantic information across the four conditions. We find four consistent effects of varying context. First, stimuli with more context evoke brain responses with higher SNR across bilateral visual, temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortices compared to stimuli with little context. Second, increasing context increases the representation of semantic information across bilateral temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortices at the group level. In individual subjects, only natural language stimuli consistently evoke widespread representation of semantic information. Third, context affects voxel semantic tuning. Finally, models estimated using stimuli with little context do not generalize well to natural language. These results show that context has large effects on the quality of neuroimaging data and on the representation of meaning in the brain. Thus, neuroimaging studies that use stimuli with little context may not generalize well to the natural regime.\n\nSignificance StatementContext is an important part of understanding the meaning of natural language, but most neuroimaging studies of meaning use isolated words and isolated sentences with little context. Here we examined whether the results of neuroimaging studies that use out-of-context stimuli generalize to natural language. We find that increasing context improves the quality of neuroimaging data and changes where and how semantic information is represented in the brain. These results suggest that findings from studies using out-of-context stimuli may not generalize to natural language used in daily life.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDispersal has three major effects on adaptation. First, gene flow mixes alleles adapted to different environments, potentially hindering (swamping) adaptation. Second, it brings in other variants and inflates genetic variance: this aids adaptation to spatially (and temporally) varying environments but if selection is hard, it lowers the mean fitness of the population. Third, neighbourhood size, which determines how weak genetic drift is, increases with dispersal - when genetic drift is strong, increase of the neighbourhood size with dispersal aids adaptation. In this note I focus on the role of dispersal in environments which change gradually across space, and when local populations are quite small such that genetic drift has a significant effect. Using individual-based simulations, I show that in small populations, even leptokurtic dispersal benefits adaptation, by reducing the power of genetic drift. This has implications for management of fragmented or marginal populations: the beneficial effect of increased dispersal into small populations is stronger than swamping of adaption under a broad range of conditions, including a mixture of local and long-distance dispersal. However, when environmental gradient is steep, heavily fat-tailed dispersal will swamp continuous adaptation so that only patches of locally adapted subpopulations remain.",
