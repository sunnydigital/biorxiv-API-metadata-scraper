    "abstract": "Constantly in flux, low-molecular-weight organic substances (LMWOSs) are at the nexus between microorganisms, plant roots, detritus, and the soil mineral matrix. Nominal oxidation state of carbon (NOSC) has been put forward as one way to parameterize microbial uptake rates of LMWOSs and efficiency of carbon incorporation into new biomass. In this study, we employed an ecophysiological approach to test these proposed relationships using targeted exometabolomics (1H-NMR, HR-LCMS) coupled with stable isotope (13C) probing. We assessed the role of compound class and oxidation state on uptake kinetics and substrate-specific carbon use efficiency (SUE) during the growth of three model soil microorganisms (Penicillium spinulosum, Paraburkholderia solitsugae, and Ralstonia pickettii) in media containing 34 common LMWOSs. Microbial isolates were chosen to span a gradient in growth rate (0.046-0.316 hr-1) and differ phylogenetically (a fungal isolate and two bacterial isolates). Clustered, co-utilization of LMWOSs occured for all three organisms, but temporal cluster separation was most apparent for P. solitsugae. Potential trends (p <0.05) for early utilization of more oxidized substrates were present for the two bacterial isolates (P. solitsugae and R. pickettii), but high variability (R2 > 0.15) and a small effect of NOSC indicate these are not useful relationships for prediction. The SUEs ranged from 0.16-0.99 and the hypothesized inverse relationship between NOSC and SUE was not observed. Thus, our results do not provide compelling support for NOSC as a predictive tool, implying that metabolic strategies of organisms may be more important than chemical identity in determining LMWOS cycling in soils.\n\nImportanceCommunity-level observations from soils indicate that low-molecular-weight compounds of higher oxidation state tend to be depleted from soil solution faster and incorporated less efficiently into microbial biomass under oxic conditions. Here, we tested hypothetical relationships between substrate chemical characteristics and the order of substrate utilization by aerobic heterotrophs at the population-level in culture, using two bacterial isolates (Ralstonia pickettii and Paraburkholderia solitsugae) and one fungal isolate from soil (Penicillium spinulosum). We found weak relationships indicating earlier uptake of more oxidized substrates by the two bacterial isolates but no relationship for the fungal isolate. We found no relationship between substrate identity and substrate use efficiency. Our findings indicate that substrate chemical characteristics have limited utility for modeling the depletion of low-molecular-weight organics from soil solution and incorporation into biomass over broader phylogenetic gradients.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-based gene-drive systems have been proposed for managing insect populations, including disease-transmitting mosquitoes, due to their ability to bias their inheritance towards super-Mendelian rates (>50%). Current technologies employ a Cas9 that introduces DNA double-strand breaks into the opposing wildtype allele to replace it with a copy of the gene drive allele via DNA homology-directed repair. Yet, the use of different Cas9s versions is unexplored, and alternative approaches could increase the available toolkit for gene-drive designs. Here, we report a novel gene-drive approach that relies on Cas9 nickases that generate staggered paired nicks in DNA to propagate the engineered gene-drive cassette. We show that generating 5 overhangs in the system yields efficient allelic conversion. The nickase gene-drive arrangement produces large, stereotyped deletions that are advantageous for targeting essential genes. Indeed, our nickase approach should expand the repertoire for gene-drive designs aimed at applications in mosquitoes and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is widely recognized as an optimal model for precise medicine guided molecular biomarkers of cancer, however, few clinical practices were applied till now. Based on the data from our own studies and published papers, it was found that the expression of MAL was significantly decreased in epithelial cancer as compared with normal tissues, and exhibited a opposite association with pathological grade. To study the molecular events related to deficiency of MAL during carcinogenesis, occurrence and development, a Mal knockout mouse model was constructed and consistently reproduced and bred. The Mal knockout mice are highly vulnerable to tumor induction by carcinogen of 4NQO, evidenced by their extremely earlier carcinogenesis, higher incidence, and more aggressive growth. Analysis of scRNA-seq data indicated that Mal knockout mice lost the ability in maintaining epithelial cell differentiation and get more prone to carcinogen with a remarkably higher incidence of epithelial malignancy. Further analyses identified putative co-functional genes of MAL, including DSG1, AQP3 and S100A8, which are key factors in maintaining epithelial cell differentiation. To conclude, the current study exhibits the clinical significance and explains the tumor suppressing function of MAL. The results also suggest the potential of MAL and its co-functional genes being biomarkers for designing the prevention and/or differentiation therapy strategies in OSCC.\n\nSignificanceMAL is found to be strongly opposite with tumor pathological grade from clinical and in vivo studies in OSCC. We propose MAL and its co-functional genes, including DSG1, AQP3 and S100A8, as key factors in maintaining epithelial cell differentiation and are valuable targets for designing prevention and differentiation therapy strategies in OSCC.",

    "abstract": "The stem cell theory that all blood cells are derived from hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) is a central dogma in hematology. However, various types of blood cells are already produced from hemogenic endothelial cells (HECs) before the first HSCs appear at embryonic day (E)11 in the mouse embryo. This early blood cell production from HECs, called HSC-independent hematopoiesis, includes primitive and definitive erythromyeloid progenitors that transiently support fetal blood homeostasis until HSC-derived hematopoiesis is established. Lymphoid potential has traditionally been detected in the extra-embryonic yolk sac (YS) and/or embryos before HSC emergence, but the actual presence of lymphoid progenitors at this stage remains unknown. In addition, whether HSCs in the fetal liver are the main source of innate-like B-1a cells has been controversial. Here, using complementary lineage tracing mouse models, we show that HSC-independent multipotent progenitors (MPPs) and HSC-independent adoptive B-lymphoid progenitors persist into adult life. Furthermore, HSCs minimally contribute to the peritoneal B-1a cell pool; most B-1a cells are originated directly from ECs in the YS and embryo and HSC-independent for life. Our discovery of extensive HSC-independent MPP and B-lymphoid progenitors in adults attests to the complex blood developmental dynamics through embryo to adult that underpin the immune system and challenges the paradigm of HSC theory in hematology.",

    "abstract": "The cyanobacterial enzyme CylK assembles the cylindrocyclophane natural products by performing two unusual alkylation reactions, forming new carbon-carbon bonds between aromatic rings and secondary alkyl halide substrates. This transformation is unprecedented in biology and the structure and mechanism of CylK are unknown. Here, we report x-ray crystal structures of CylK, revealing a distinctive fusion of a Ca2+ binding domain and a {beta}-propeller fold. We use a mutagenic screening approach to locate CylKs active site at its domain interface, identifying two residues, Arg105 and Tyr473, that are required for catalysis. Anomalous diffraction datasets collected with bound bromide ions, a product analog, suggest these residues interact with the alkyl halide electrophile. Additional mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations implicates Asp440 and Glu374 in activating the nucleophilic aromatic ring. Bioinformatic analysis of CylK homologs from other cyanobacteria establishes that they conserve these key catalytic amino acids but they are likely associated with divergent reactivity and altered secondary metabolism. By gaining a molecular understanding of this unusual biosynthetic transformation, this work fills a gap in our understanding of how alkyl halides are activated and used by enzymes as biosynthetic intermediates, informing enzyme engineering, catalyst design, and natural product discovery.",

    "abstract": "The interpretation of single-molecule experiments is frequently aided by computational modeling of biomolecular dynamics. The growth of computing power and ongoing validation of computational models suggest that it soon may be possible to replace some experiments out-right with computational mimics. Here we offer a blueprint for performing single-molecule studies in silico using a DNA binding protein as a test bed. We demonstrate how atomistic simulations, typically limited to sub-millisecond durations and zeptoliter volumes, can guide development of a coarse-grained model for use in simulations that mimic experimental assays. We show that, after initially correcting excess attraction between the DNA and protein, qualitative consistency between several experiments and their computational equivalents is achieved, while additionally providing a detailed portrait of the underlying mechanics. Finally the model is used to simulate the trombone loop of a replication fork, a large complex of proteins and DNA.",

Quinacrine, an anti-malarial drug, has been widely reported to exhibit anti-neoplastic properties through the activation of p53 and simultaneous inhibition of NF-kB signaling pathways in cancer cells.\n\nMethodsThe binding of QC to FGFR1 was studied using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies. The experimental kinase activity assay for the protein was performed using a luminescence-based kinase assay. FGF-induced phosphorylation and proliferation were studied by cell counting and western blotting. Matrigel-based cell migration was conducted to assess migration activity.\n\nResultsQC interacted with multiple residues around the kinase insert domain of FGFR1 through hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and water bridges. The kinase activity inhibition assay demonstrated a significant reduction in FGFR1 kinase activity by QC at higher concentrations, which was further observed at the cellular level in inhibition of FGFR1 phosphorylation and proliferation by QC at higher exposure concentrations of FGF stimulated cells. These effects were further validated downstream in the FGF-induced activation of cell migration.\n\nConclusionQC did form a stable interaction with residues of FGFR1 at another allosteric site surrounding the kinase domain, leading to inhibition of its kinase activity at higher drug concentrations. This effect was further observed at the cellular level in both acidic and basic FGF ligand-induced proliferation, phosphorylation of FGFR1, and cell migration, where a trend of significant reduction in activity was observed at higher drug concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Allele-specific expression (ASE), or the preferential expression of one allele, can be observed in transcriptomics data from early development throughout the lifespan. However, the prevalence of spatial and cell type-specific ASE variation remains unclear. Spatial transcriptomics technologies permit the study of spatial ASE patterns genome-wide at near-single-cell resolution. However, the data are highly sparse, and confounding between cell type and spatial location present further statistical challenges. Here, we introduce spASE (https://github.com/lulizou/spase), a computational framework for detecting spatial patterns in ASE within and across cell types from spatial transcriptomics data. To tackle the challenge presented by the low signal to noise ratio due to the sparsity of the data, we implement a spatial smoothing approach that greatly improves statistical power. We generated Slide-seqV2 data from the mouse hippocampus and detected ASE in X-chromosome genes, both within and across cell type, validating our ability to recover known ASE patterns. We demonstrate that our method can also identify cell type-specific effects, which we find can explain the majority of the spatial signal for autosomal genes. The findings facilitated by our method provide new insight into the uncharacterized landscape of spatial and cell type-specific ASE in the mouse hippocampus.",

While these workflows enable accurate quantification of the most abundant genes, they are less effective for applications that require expression profiling of low abundant transcripts, like long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), or selected gene panels. To tackle these issues, we describe a workflow combining 3-end library preparation with 3-end hybrid capture probes and shallow RNA-sequencing for cost-effective, targeted quantification of subsets of (low abundant) genes across hundreds to thousands of samples. To assess the performance of the method, we designed a capture probe set for more than 100 mRNA and lncRNA target genes and applied the workflow to a cohort of 360 samples. When compared to standard 3-end RNA-sequencing, 3-end capture sequencing resulted in a more than 100-fold enrichment of target gene abundance while conserving relative inter-gene and inter-sample abundances. 3-end RNA capture sequencing enables accurate targeted gene expression profiling at extremely shallow sequencing depth.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary evolution has the potential to significantly alter biotic responses to global change, including range expansion dynamics and biological invasions. However, predictive models often make highly simplifying assumptions about the genetic architecture underlying relevant traits. This can be problematic since genetic architecture defines evolvability, that is, evolutionary rates, and higher order evolutionary processes, which determine whether evolution will be able to keep up with environmental change or not. Therefore, we here study the impact of the genetic architecture of dispersal and local adaptation, two central traits of high relevance for range expansion dynamics, on the speed and variability of range expansions into an environmental gradient, such as temperature. In our theoretical model we assume that dispersal and local adaptation traits result from the products of two non-interacting gene-regulatory networks (GRNs). We compare our model to simpler quantitative genetics models and show that in the GRN model, range expansions are accelerated, faster and more variable. Increased variability implies that these evolutionary changes reduce predictability. We further find that acceleration in the GRN model is primarily driven by an increase in the rate of local adaptation to novel habitats which results from greater sensitivity to mutation (decreased robustness) and increased gene expression. Our results highlight how processes at microscopic scales, here, within genomes, can impact the predictions of large scale, macroscopic phenomena, such as range expansions, by modulating the rate of evolution.",

Synaptic plasticity that underlies habituation learning has been described at the cellular level, yet the genetic regulators of this plasticity remain poorly understood, as do circuits that mediate sensory filtering. A forward genetic screen for zebrafish genes that control habituation learning identified a mutant allele doryp177 that caused reduced habituation of the acoustic startle response. Whole-genome sequencing identified the calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha-2/delta-3 (cacna2d3) as a candidate gene affected in doryp177 mutants. Behavioral characterization of larvae homozygous for two additional, independently derived mutant alleles of cacna2d3, together with failure of these alleles to complement doryp177, confirmed a critical role for cacna2d3 in habituation learning. Notably, detailed analyses of the acoustic response in mutant larvae also revealed increased startle sensitivity to acoustic stimuli, suggesting a broader role for cacna2d3 in controlling innate response thresholds to acoustic stimuli. Taken together, our data demonstrate a critical role for cacna2d3 in sensory filtering, a process that is disrupted in human CNS disorders, e.g. ADHD, schizophrenia, and autism.",
