    "abstract": "Aggregating welfare across individuals is a fundamental problem in our society. There is no rational aggregation procedure without interpersonally comparable utility (Arrows impossibility theorem). However, scientific methods for interpersonal comparison of utility have thus far not been available. Here, we have developed such a method based on brain signals that correlated with changes in expected utility weighted by subjective probability. The signal was larger for participants with lower household incomes than for those with higher household incomes and their ratio coincided with the estimates by \"impartial spectators\". These findings suggest that our interpersonal comparison method enables scientifically reasonable welfare aggregation.",

    "abstract": "AlphaFold2 is expected to be able to predict protein complex structures as long as a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the interologs of the target protein-protein interaction (PPI) can be provided. In this study, a simplified phylogeny-based approach was applied to generate the MSA of interologs, which was then used as the input to AlphaFold2 for protein complex structure prediction. Extensively benchmarked this protocol on non-redundant PPI dataset including 107 bacterial PPIs and 442 eukaryotic PPIs, we show complex structures of 79.5% of the bacterial PPIs and 49.8% of the eukaryotic PPIs can be successfully predicted, which yielded significantly better performance than the application of MSA of interologs prepared by two existing approaches. Considering PPIs may not be conserved in species with long evolutionary distances, we further restricted interologs in the MSA to different taxonomic ranks of the species of the target PPI in protein complex structure prediction. We found the success rates can be increased to 87.9% for the bacterial PPIs and 56.3% for the eukaryotic PPIs if interologs in the MSA are restricted to a specific taxonomic rank of the species of each target PPI. Finally, we show the optimal taxonomic ranks for protein complex structure prediction can be selected with the application of the predicted TM-scores of the output models.",

    "abstract": "Proteins with DNA binding Myb domains have been suggested in regulating development and stress responses. Magnaporthe oryzae is considered the most destructive pathogen of rice. We screened the genome for genes with Myb domains encoding since these can be needed for pathogenesis. We found Myb1-19. Only MoMyb1 was previously shown to be involved in pathogenesis. We succeeded in deleting 12 of the other 18 genes. MoMyb2 deletion affected mainly growth, while MoMyb13 or MoMyb15 deletions gave additional defects in conidiation and plant infection. However, RT-qPCR showed that none of the 19 Myb genes are negligibly expressed. Instead, they have different expression profiles hours post-infection when infecting rice plants. Considering this, the unchanged infection phenotype for 9 gene deletions surprised us, and we extended the analysis to expression co-regulation of all 19 Myb proteins and found 5 co-regulated groups of predicted Myb-domain proteins. MoMyb13 or MoMyb15 are discussed and motivated as candidates for further, more detailed studies with aims also outside of plant pathology. Referring to what is found in other eukaryotes, we finally discuss possible redundancy or compensatory regulations for many of the other Myb genes hiding or compensating for the effect of many complete deletions.\n\nIMPORTANCEMagnaporthe oryzae is considered the most important rice pathogen limiting rice production. Our study attempts to find all genes encoding a DNA-binding gene family called Myb, and we found 19, many of which have not been studied before. The Myb gene family is suspected to regulate stress responses the pathogen needs to overcome plant defenses. Inhibiting or disturbing these genes, if they are indeed regulatory, can open new ways of controlling the pathogen and learning more about its physiology and ecology.",

Three biofloc treatments with an C:N (contained in the inputted feed and carbon source with the assumption that 75% of the feed nitrogen is excreted) of 8:1 (CN8), 16:1 (CN16) and 24:1 (CN24), respectively, were designed to stocking shrimp juveniles (~ 0.8 g) at a density of 270 individuals m-3, for a 63-days culture experiment at a salinity of about 5{per thousand}. Results showed that in CN8 treatment, the levels of pH (6.9{+/-}0.1), carbonate alkalinity (104.0{+/-}2.8mg L-1 CaCO3), biofloc volume (4.8{+/-}0.9mL L-1) and TSS (327.4{+/-}24.4mg L-1) were significantly lower than those in the other two treatments ([&ge;]7.6{+/-}0.3, [&ge;]157.6{+/-}21.6mg L-1 CaCO3, [&ge;]24.1{+/-}3.7mL L-1 and [&ge;]508.1{+/-}32.3mg L-1, P<0.05); whereas the levels of TAN (7.1{+/-}0.9mg L-1), nitrite (14.0{+/-}3.6mg L-1) and nitrate (77.0{+/-}5.0mg L-1) were significantly higher than those in the other treatments ([&le;]2.0{+/-}0.6mg L-1, [&le;]4.9{+/-}3.1mg L-1 and [&le;]14.7{+/-}5.9mg L-1, P<0.05). The zootechnical parameters of shrimp were not significantly different between three treatments (P>0.05), except that the survival rates in CN16 treatment (96.8{+/-}2.0%) and CN24 treatment (93.7{+/-}4.2%) were significantly higher than that of CN8 treatment (81.5{+/-}6.4%, P<0.05). The results indicated that an inputted C:N higher than 16:1 was suitable for the biofloc system with a low salinity of 5{per thousand}, with an optimal inferred C:N range of 18.5-21.0:1 for water quality and growth performance.",

    "abstract": "A widespread application of three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting in basic and translational research requires the accessibility to affordable printers able to produce physiologically relevant tissue models. To facilitate the use of bioprinting as a standard technique in biology, an open-source device based on a consumer-grade 3D stereolithographic (SL) printer was developed. This SL bioprinter can produce complex constructs that preserve cell viability and recapitulate the physiology of tissues. The detailed documentation of the modifications apported to the printer as well as a throughout performance analysis allow for a straightforward adoption of the device in other labs and its customization for specific applications. Given the low cost, several modified bioprinters could be simultaneously operated for a highly parallelized tissue production.\n\nTo showcase the capability of the bioprinter, we produced constructs consisting of patient-derived cholangiocarcinoma organoids encapsulated in a gelatin methacrylate (GelMA)/polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel. A thorough characterization of different GelMA/PEGDA ratios revealed that the mechanical properties of the bioprinted tumor model can be accurately fine-tuned to mimic a specific tumor micro-environment. Immunofluorescence and gene expression analyses of tumor markers confirmed that the bioprinted synthetic hydrogel provides a flexible and adequate replacement of animal-derived reconstituted extracellular matrix.",

We provide a structural framework for understanding the marked reduction of binding of all other therapeutic mAbs leading to dampened neutralizing activity. We reveal electrostatic remodeling of the interactions within the spike and those formed between the Omicron RBD and human ACE2, likely explaining enhanced affinity for the host receptor relative to the prototypic virus.",

    "abstract": "The amygdalar anterior basolateral nucleus (BLa) plays a vital role in emotional behaviors. This region receives dense cholinergic projections from basal forebrain which are critical in regulating neuronal activity and synaptic transmission. Cholinergic signaling in BLa is thought to occur through both a slow mode of volume transmission as well as a rapid, phasic mode. However, the relative effect of each mode of signaling in BLa is not understood. Here, we used electrophysiology and optogenetics in mouse brain slices to compare regulation of afferent input from cortex and thalamus to the BLa by these two modes of transmission. Phasic ACh release evoked by single pulse stimulation of cholinergic terminals had a biphasic effect on glutamatergic transmission at cortical input, producing rapid nicotinic receptor-mediated facilitation followed by slower muscarinic receptor (mAChR)-mediated depression. In contrast, tonic elevation of ACh through application of the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine suppressed glutamatergic transmission at cortical inputs through mAChRs only. This suppression was not observed at thalamic inputs to BLa. In agreement with this pathway-specificity, the mAChR agonist, muscarine more potently suppressed transmission at inputs from prelimbic cortex (PL) than thalamus. Muscarinic inhibition at PL input was dependent on presynaptic M4 mAChRs, while at thalamic input it depended upon M3 mAChR-mediated stimulation of retrograde endocannabinoid signaling. Muscarinic inhibition at both pathways was frequency-dependent, allowing only high frequency activity to pass. These findings demonstrate complex cholinergic regulation of afferent input to BLa that depends upon the mode of ACh release and is both pathway specific and frequency dependent.\n\nSignificance statementCholinergic modulation of the basolateral amygdala regulates formation of emotional memories, but the mechanisms underlying this regulation are not well understood. Here, we show, using mouse brain slices, that ACh differentially regulates afferent transmission to the BLa depending on the mode of cholinergic signaling. Rapid, phasic ACh produces a biphasic excitatory-inhibitory regulation of glutamatergic transmission mediated by nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, respectively. In contrast, slow, tonic ACh produces muscarinic inhibition only. Tonic regulation is pathway specific with cortical input regulated more strongly than thalamic input. This disparity is caused by differential regulation by M4 and M3 receptors at the two inputs. Specific targeting of these receptors may thus provide a therapeutic strategy to bias amygdalar processing and regulate emotional memory.",

While the transcriptional profiles of naive, effector and memory adaptive T cells have been well studied, less is known about transcriptional regulation of different iNKT cell activation states. Here, using single cell RNA-sequencing, we performed longitudinal profiling of activated iNKT cells, generating a transcriptomic atlas of iNKT cell activation states. We found that transcriptional signatures of activation are highly conserved among heterogeneous iNKT cell populations, including NKT1, NKT2 and NKT17 subsets, and human iNKT cells. Strikingly, we found that regulatory iNKT cells, such as adipose iNKT cells, undergo blunted activation, and display constitutive enrichment of memory-like cMAF+ and KLRG1+ populations. Moreover, we identify a conserved cMAF-associated transcriptional network among NKT10 cells, providing novel insights into the biology of regulatory and antigen experienced iNKT cells.",
