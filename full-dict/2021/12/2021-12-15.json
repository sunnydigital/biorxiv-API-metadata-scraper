    "abstract": "Globally, weedy plants result in more crop yield loss than plant pathogens and insect pests combined. Much of the success of weeds rests with their ability to rapidly adapt in the face of human-mediated environmental management and change. The evolution of resistance to herbicides is an emblematic example of this rapid adaptation. Here, we focus on Alopecurus myosuroides (blackgrass), the most impactful agricultural weed in Europe. To gain insights into the evolutionary history and genomic mechanisms underlying adaptation in blackgrass, we assembled and annotated its large, complex genome. We show that non-target site herbicide resistance is oligogenic and likely evolves from standing genetic variation. We present evidence for divergent selection of resistance at the level of the genome in wild, evolved populations, though at the transcriptional level, resistance mechanisms are underpinned by similar patterns of up-regulation of stress- and defence-responsive gene families. These gene families are expanded in the blackgrass genome, suggesting that the large, duplicated, and dynamic genome plays a role in enabling rapid adaptation in blackgrass. These observations have wide significance for understanding rapid plant adaptation in novel stressful environments.",

    "abstract": "The recently reported Omicron (B.1.1.529) SARS-CoV-2 variant has a large number of mutations in the Spike (S) protein compared to previous variants. Here we evaluate the potential effect of Omicron S mutations on S protein dynamics and ACE2 binding as contributing factors to infectivity as well as propensity for immune escape. We define a consensus set of mutations from 77 sequences assigned as Omicron in GISAID as of November 25. We create structural models of the Omicron S protein in the open and closed states, as part of a complex with ACE2 and for each of 77 complexes of S bound to different antibodies with known structures. We have previously utilized Dynamical Signatures (DS) and the Vibrational Entropy Score (VDS) to evaluate the propensity of S variants to favour the open state. Here, we introduce the Binding Influence Score (BIS) to evaluate the influence of mutations on binding affinity based on the net gain or loss of interactions within the protein-protein interface. BIS shows excellent correlation with experimental data (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87) on individual mutations in the ACE2 interface for the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron variants combined. On the one hand, the DS of Omicron highly favours a more rigid open state and a more flexible closed state with the largest VDS of all variants to date, suggesting a large increase in the chances to interact with ACE2. On the other hand, the BIS shows that apart from N501Y, all other mutations in the interface reduce ACE2 binding affinity. VDS and BIS show opposing effects on the overall effectiveness of Omicron mutations to promote binding to ACE2 and therefore initiate infection. To evaluate the propensity for immune escape we calculated the net change of favourable and unfavourable interactions within each S-antibody interface. The net change of interactions shows a positive score (a net increase of favourable interactions and decrease of unfavourable ones) for 41 out of 77 antibodies, a nil score for 15 and a negative score for 21 antibodies. Therefore, in only 28% of S-antibody complexes (21/77) we predict some level of immune escape due to a weakening of the interactions with Omicron S. Considering that most antibody epitopes and the mutations are within the S-ACE2 interface our results suggest that mutations within the RBD of Omicron may give rise to only partial immune escape, which comes at the expense of reduced ACE2 binding affinity. However, this reduced ACE2 affinity appears to have been offset by increasing the occupancy of the open state of the Spike protein.",

    "abstract": "Plant pathogens secrete proteins, known as effectors, that function in the apoplast or inside plant cells to promote virulence. Effector detection by cell-surface or cytosolic receptors results in the activation of defence pathways and plant immunity. Despite their importance, our general understanding of fungal effector function and detection by immunity receptors remains poor. One complication often associated with effectors is their high sequence diversity and lack of identifiable sequence motifs precluding prediction of structure or function. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated that fungal effectors can be grouped into structural classes, despite significant sequence variation and existence across taxonomic groups. Using protein x-ray crystallography, we identify a new structural class of effectors hidden within the secreted in xylem (SIX) effectors from Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol). The recognised effectors Avr1 (SIX4) and Avr3 (SIX1) represent the founding members of the Fol dual-domain (FOLD) effector class, with members containing two distinct domains. Using AlphaFold2, we predicted the full SIX effector repertoire of Fol and show that SIX6 and SIX13 are also FOLD effectors, which we validated experimentally for SIX6. Based on structural prediction and comparisons, we show that FOLD effectors are present within three divisions of fungi and are expanded in pathogens and symbionts. Further structural comparisons demonstrate that Fol secretes a limited number of structurally related effectors during infection of tomato. This analysis also revealed a structural relationship between transcriptionally co-regulated effector pairs. We make use of the Avr1 structure to understand its recognition by the I receptor, which lead to disease resistance in tomato. This study represents an important advance in our understanding of Fol-tomato, and by extension plant-fungal interactions, which will assist the development of novel control and engineering strategies to combat plant pathogens.",

    "abstract": "The Membrane Attack Complex (MAC or C5b-9) is an important effector of the immune system to kill invading microbes. MAC is formed when complement enzymes on the bacterial surface convert complement component C5 into C5b. Although the MAC is a membrane-inserted complex, soluble forms of MAC (sMAC, or terminal complement complex (TCC)) are often detected in sera of patients suffering from infections. Consequently, sMAC has been proposed as a biomarker, but it remains unclear when and how it is formed during infections. Here, we studied mechanisms of MAC formation on bacteria and found that sMAC is primarily formed in human serum by bacteria resistant to MAC-dependent killing. Surprisingly, C5 was converted into C5b more potently by MAC-resistant compared to MAC-sensitive Escherichia coli strains. Both the increase in C5 conversion and sMAC generation were linked to the expression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-Antigen in the bacterial outer membrane. In addition, we found that MAC precursors are released from the surface of MAC-resistant bacteria during MAC assembly. Release of MAC precursors from bacteria induced lysis of bystander human erythrocytes in the absence of other serum components. However, serum regulators vitronectin (Vn) and clusterin (Clu) can prevent this bystander lysis. Combining size exclusion chromatography with mass spectrometry profiling, we show that sMAC released from bacteria in serum is a heterogeneous mixture of complexes composed of C5b-8, up to 3 copies of C9 and multiple copies of Vn and Clu. Altogether, our data provide molecular insight into how sMAC is generated during bacterial infections. This fundamental knowledge could form the basis for exploring the use of sMAC as biomarker.",

We reported the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets of LYSC98 against Staphylococcus aureus using a murine thigh infection model. Three Staphylococcus aureus strains were utilized. Single-dose plasma pharmacokinetics of LYSC98 were determined in infected mice after the tail vein injection of 2, 4, and 8mg/kg. The results showed maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) 11466.67 - 48866.67 ng/mL, area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h(AUC0-24) 14788.42 -91885.93 ng/mL{middle dot}h, and elimination half-life(T1/2) 1.70-2.64 h, respectively. The Cmax (R2 0.9994) and AUC0-24 (R2 0.981) were positively correlated with the dose of LYSC98 in the range of 2-8 mg/kg.\n\nDose fractionation studies using total doses of 2 to 8 mg/kg administered with q6h, q8h, q12h, and q24h were performed to evaluate the correlation of different PK/PD indices with efficacy. Sigmoid model analysis showed Cmax/MIC (R2 0.8941) was the best PK/PD index to predict the efficacy of LYSC98. In the dose ranging studies, two Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clinical strains were used to infect the mice and 2-fold-increasing doses (1 to 16 mg/kg) of LYSC98 were administered. The magnitude of LYSC98 Cmax/MIC associated with net stasis, 1, 2, 3 and 4 - log10 kill were 5.78, 8.17, 11.14, 15.85 and 30.58, respectively. The results of this study showed LYSC98 a promising antibiotic with in vivo potency against MRSA, and will help in the dose design of phase one study for LYSC98.",

    "abstract": "Dietary emulsifiers have been shown to affect the composition and function of the gut microbial community, both in vivo and in vitro. Yet, several knowledge gaps remain to be addressed: the impact from a longer timeframe exposure on the gut microbiota, interindividual variability in microbiome response and the putative impact from novel clean label alternatives for current food emulsifiers.\n\nIn the present study, the impact of one conventional dietary emulsifier, TWEEN80, and one potential novel alternative, rhamnolipids, on the human gut microbiota was investigated using the Mucosal Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (M-SHIME). The faecal microbiota from two human donors, with high and low responsiveness to the emulsifiers, were exposed to 0,05 m% and 0,5 m% of the emulsifiers for 7 days.\n\nThe results confirmed previous observations that the effects on the composition and functionality are both emulsifier- and donor dependent. The effects reached an equilibrium after about 3 days of exposure. Overall, TWEEN80 and rhamnolipids displayed opposite effects: TWEEN80 increased cell counts, reduced propionate concentration, increased butyrate levels, increased a.o. Faecalibacterium, Blautia and Hungatella abundance, while rhamnolipids did the opposite. Rhamnolipids also sharply increased the abundance of unclassified Lachnospiraceae. On the other hand, both emulsifiers increased the relative abundance of unclassified Enterobacteriaceae. Both emulsifiers also altered the microbial metabolome in different ways and a pathway enrichment analysis tool revealed that the metabolome alterations could be reminiscent of gut issues and obesity.\n\nOverall, the impact from the rhamnolipids was larger than that of TWEEN80 at similar concentrations, indicating that the former may not necessarily be a safer alternative for the latter. The microbiotas response also depended on its original composition and the sensitivity status for which the faecal donors were selected, was preserved. Whether the same donor-diversity and longitudinal impact can be expected in the human colon as well and what impact this has on the host will have to be further investigated.",

    "abstract": "Linear plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA that have been found in a small number of bacterial species. To date, the only linear plasmids described in the Enterobacteriaceae family belong to Salmonella, first found in Salmonella Typhi. Here, we describe a collection of 12 isolates of the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex in which we identified linear plasmids. We used this collection to search public sequence databases and discovered an additional 74 linear plasmid sequences in a variety of Enterobacteriaceae species. Gene content analysis divided these plasmids into five distinct phylogroups, with very few genes shared across more than two phylogroups. The majority of linear plasmid-encoded genes are of unknown function, however each phylogroup carried its own unique toxin-antitoxin system and genes with homology to those encoding the ParAB plasmid stability system. Passage in vitro of the 12 linear plasmid-carrying Klebsiella isolates in our collection (which include representatives of all five phylogroups) indicated that these linear plasmids can be stably maintained, and our data suggest they can transmit between K. pneumoniae strains (including members of globally disseminated multidrug resistant clones) and also between diverse Enterobacteriaceae species. The linear plasmid sequences, and representative isolates harbouring them, are made available as a resource to facilitate future studies on the evolution and function of these novel plasmids.\n\nSignificance as a BioResource to the communityThis study provides the first report of linear plasmids identified within the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex and the first report in Enterobacteriaceae besides Salmonella.We present the first comparative analysis of linear plasmid sequences in Enterobacteriaceae, however whilst this family is highly clinically significant, the functional and/or evolutionary importance of these plasmids is not yet clear.

    "abstract": "Sustainable strategies for energy production are required to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and to power electronics without generating toxic waste.1-7 Generating electricity from water evaporation through engineered materials is a promising approach,8,9 but power outputs have been low and the materials employed were not sustainably produced. Microorganisms can be mass produced with renewable feedstocks. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to engineer microbial biofilms as a cohesive, flexible material for long-term continuous electricity production from evaporating water. The biofilm sheets were the functional component in devices that continuously produced power densities ([~]1 W/cm2) higher than that achieved with non-biological materials. Current production scaled directly with biofilm-sheet size and skin-patch devices harvested sufficient electricity from the moisture on skin to continuously power wearable devices. The results demonstrate that appropriately engineered biofilms can perform as robust functional materials without the need for further processing or maintaining cell viability. Biofilm-based hydroelectric current production was comparable to that achieved with similar sized biofilms catalyzing current production in microbial fuel cells,10,11 without the need for an organic feedstock or maintaining cell viability. The ubiquity of biofilms in nature suggests the possibility of additional sources of biomaterial for evaporation-based electricity generation and the possibility of harvesting electricity from diverse aqueous environments.",

    "abstract": "Because parasites have an inextricable relationship with their host, they have the potential to serve as viral reservoirs or facilitate virus host-shifts. Yet, little is known about viruses infecting parasitic hosts except for blood-feeding arthropods that are well-known vectors of zoonotic viruses. Herein we uncover viruses of flatworms (Phylum Platyhelminthes, group Neodermata) that specialize in parasitizing vertebrates and their ancestral free-living relatives. We discovered 115 novel viral sequences, including 1 in Macrostomorpha, 5 in Polycladida, 44 in Tricladida, 1 in Monogenea, 15 in Cestoda and 49 in Trematoda, through data mining. The majority of newly identified viruses constitute novel families or genera. Phylogenetic analyses show that the virome of flatworms changed dramatically during the transition of Neodermatans to a parasitic lifestyle. Most Neodermatan viruses seem to co-diversify with their host, with the exception of rhabdoviruses which may switch host more often, based on phylogenetic relationships. Neodermatan rhabodviruses also have an ancestral position to vertebrate-associated viruses, including Lyssaviruses, suggesting that vertebrate rhabdoviruses emerged from a flatworm rhabdovirus in a parasitized host. This study reveals an extensive diversity of viruses in Platyhelminthes and highlights the need to evaluate the role of viral infection in flatworm-associated diseases.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the evolution and biosynthetic function of DNA precursor and the folate metabolism in the Asgard group of archaea. As Asgard occupy a key position in the archaeal and eukaryotic phylogenetic trees, we have exploited very recently emerged genome and metagenome sequence information to investigate these central metabolic pathways. Our genome-wide analyses revealed that the recently cultured Asgard archaeon Candidatus Prometheoarchaeum syntrophicum strain MK-D1 (Psyn) contains a complete folate-dependent network for the biosynthesis of DNA/RNA precursors, amino acids and syntrophic amino acid utilization. Altogether our experimental and computational data suggest that phylogenetic incongruences of functional folate-dependent enzymes from Asgard archaea reflect their persistent horizontal transmission from various bacterial groups, which has rewired the key metabolic reactions in an important and recently identified archaeal phylogenetic group. We also experimentally validated the functionality of the lateral gene transfer of Psyn thymidylate synthase ThyX. This enzyme uses bacterial-like folates efficiently and is inhibited by mycobacterial ThyX inhibitors. Our data raise the possibility that the thymidylate metabolism, required for de novo DNA synthesis, originated in bacteria and has been independently transferred to archaea and eukaryotes. In conclusion, our study has revealed that recent prevalent lateral gene transfer has markedly shaped the evolution of Asgard archaea by allowing them to adapt to specific ecological niches.",

The ASFV-Kenya-1033-IX stock, which underwent multiple passages in WSL (more than 20), retained its ability to replicate in primary macrophages and it also retained the virulence in vivo. At the genomic level, only a few single nucleotide differences were observed between the macrophage and WSL-grown virus.

    "abstract": "COVID-19 and influenza are both highly contagious respiratory diseases with a wide range of severe symptoms and cause great disease burdens globally. It has become very urgent and important to develop a bivalent vaccine that is able to target these two infectious diseases simultaneously. In this study, we generated three attenuated replicating recombinant VSV (rVSV) vaccine candidates. These rVSV-based vaccines co-express SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant spike protein (SP) or the receptor binding domain (RBD) and four copies of the highly conserved M2 ectodomain (M2e) of influenza A fused with the Ebola glycoprotein DC-targeting/activation domain. Animal studies have shown that immunization with these bivalent rVSV vaccines induced efficient but variable levels of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza M2e protein. Significantly, our vaccine candidates induced production of high levels of neutralizing antibodies that protected cells against SARS-CoV-2 Delta and other SP-pseudovirus infections in culture. Furthermore, vaccination with the bivalent VSV vaccine via either intramuscular or intranasal route efficiently protected mice from the lethal challenge of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses and significantly reduced viral load in the lungs. These studies provide convincing evidence for the high efficacy of this bivalent vaccine to prevent influenza replication and initiate robust immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variants. Further investigation of its efficacy to protect against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variants will provide substantial evidence for new avenues to control two contagious respiratory infections, COVID-19 and influenza.",

    "abstract": "Hepatic fibrosis (HF) is a very common condition seen in millions of patients with various liver diseases. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays critical roles in various biological and pathological processes. However, the role of m6A and its main methyltransferase METTL3 in HF remains obscure. Here, we reported that METTL3 expression was elevated in HSCs from CCl4 induced fibrotic liver. METTL3 knockdown in HSCs mediated by recombinant adeno-associated-virus serotype 9 packed short hairpin RNA against METTL3 alleviated liver injury and fibrosis compared to empty carrier group. Mechanistically, the decreased liver fibrosis in CCl4-treated HSC-specific METTL3 knockdown mice was due to the increased GPR161 that is a suppressor of Hedgehog pathway, a well-known pathway to activate in liver injury and regeneration. As expect, GPR161 transferred into HSCs alleviated liver fibrosis and HSC activation. Forced GPR161 expression inhibited Gli3 activated form nuclear accumulation and subsequently suppressed fibrosis-associate gene expression. Conclusion, HSC-specific deletion of METTL3 inhibits liver fibrosis via elevated GPR161 expression, which subsequently suppressed Hedgehog pathway activation and fibrosis-associated genes expression, providing novel therapeutic targets for HF therapy.\n\nSynopsis\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=196 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/472749v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (78K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1245f3aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e7effdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13ce319org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@61be8b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG The role of RNA m6A methyltransferase METTL3 in the progression of hepatic fibrosis is unclear.

    "abstract": "Chemical modifications of RNA affect essential properties of transcripts, such as their translation, localization and stability. 5-end RNA capping with the ubiquitous redox cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) has been discovered in organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals. However, the hypothesis that NAD+ capping might be universal in all domains of life has not been proven yet, as information on this RNA modification is missing for Archaea. Likewise, this RNA modification has not been studied in the clinically important Mycobacterium genus. Here, we demonstrate that NAD+ capping occurs in the archaeal and mycobacterial model organisms Methanosarcina barkeri and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Moreover, we identify the NAD+-capped transcripts in M. smegmatis, showing that this modification is more prevalent in stationary phase, and revealing that mycobacterial NAD+-capped transcripts include non-coding small RNAs, such as Ms1. Furthermore, we show that mycobacterial RNA polymerase incorporates NAD+ into RNA, and that the genes of NAD+-capped transcripts are preceded by promoter elements compatible with {sigma}A/{sigma}F dependent expression. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that NAD+ capping exists in the archaeal domain of life, suggesting that it is universal to all living organisms, and define the NAD+-capped RNA landscape in mycobacteria, providing a basis for its future exploration.",

Our computational free energy analysis underlines the occurrence of positive selection processes that specify omicron host adaption and bring changes on the molecular level into context with clinically relevant observations. Our free energy calculations studies regarding the interaction of omicrons RBM with human ACE2 shows weaker binding to ACE2 than alphas, deltas, or wild types RBM. Thus, less virus is predicted to be generated in time per infected cell. Our mutant analyses predict with focus on omicron variants a reduced spike-protein binding to ACE2-receptor protein possibly enhancing viral fitness / transmissibility and resulting in a delayed induction of danger signals as trade-off. Finally, more virus is produced but less per cell accompanied with delayed Covid-19 immunogenicity and pathogenicity.

    "abstract": "Glomerular podocytes are instrumental in ensuring glomerular permselectivity and regulating the integrity of glomerular biology. However, podocytes are vulnerable to various noxious stimuli such as hypoxia, and podocyte injury presented with glomerulosclerosis and impaired kidney function. The mechanism of hypoxia-induced podocyte injury vis-a-vis glomerulosclerosis has remained enigmatic. Hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1) that transduces hypoxic adaptations, induces Transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a calcium dependent enzyme that catalyzes intramolecular {varepsilon}-({gamma}-glutamyl) lysine cross-links of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of regulation of TG2 by HIF1. Stabilization of HIF1 by FG4592 (Roxadustat) and physiological hypoxia, resulted in elevated expression of ZEB2 (zinc-finger E-box-homeobox 2) and its downstream target TRPC6 (transient receptor potential channel 6). ZEB2 transcriptionally activates TG2 expression, whereas, via TRPC6, it induces calcium influx, inturn it increases the TG2 activity. Blocking the TRPC6 action or suppressing its expression only partially attenuated FG4592 induced TG2 activity, whereas suppression of ZEB2 expression significantly abolished TG2 activity. This study demonstrates that stabilization of HIF1 stimulates both TG2 expression and activity, whereas abrogation of HIF1 by metformin prevented HIF1 regulated TG2 and consequent glomerular injury.",

We introduce different MSN probes covering diverse phosphorylation patterns, such as pppGpp, ppGpp, and pGpp. Our chemical proteomics approach provides datasets of diverse putative MSN receptors both from cytosolic and membrane fractions that, upon validation, unveil new MSN targets. We find, for example, that the dinucleoside polyphosphate hydrolase activity of the non-Nudix hydrolase ApaH is potently inhibited by pppGpp, which itself is converted to pGpp by ApaH.

We show that the extraction efficiency and stability is highly variable across protocols and tissues by using different quality metrics including the limit of detection and variability between replicates as well as the sum of concentration as a global estimate of extraction stability. The profile of extracted metabolites depends on the used solvents - an observation which has implications for measurements of different sample types and metabolic compounds of interest.

SMC complexes mediate chromosome folding by DNA loop extrusion. In most bacteria, SMC complexes start loop extrusion at the ParB/parS partition complex formed near the replication origin. Whether they are recruited by recognizing a specific DNA structure in the partition complex or a protein component is unknown. By replacing genes in Bacillus subtilis with orthologous sequences from Streptococcus pneumoniae, we show that the three subunits of the bacterial Smc complex together with the ParB protein form a functional module that can organize and segregate chromosomes when transplanted into another organism. Using chimeric proteins and chemical cross-linking, we find that ParB binds to the Smc subunit directly. We map a binding interface to the Smc joint and the ParB CTP-binding domain.

As observed by distinct shifted bands in a phos-tag gel, 12 of the 24 detected RRs show homogenous mixtures of phosphorylated proteins or heterogenous mixtures of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated proteins. By evaluating the phosphorylation state of CzcR and CopR II under varying assay parameters, we found that changes to pH and exogenous addition of phospho-donors (e.g. acetyl phosphate) have little to no effect on phosphorylation state. By applying protein production conditions that decrease the pool of intracellular acetyl-phosphate in E. coli, we found a reduction in the phosphorylated population of CopR II when magnesium was added to the media, but observed no change in phosphorylated population when CopR II is expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3){Delta} pta, a mutant with a metabolic disruption to the acetyl-phosphate pathway. Therefore, the specific mechanism of post-translational phosphorylation of RRs in E. coli remains obscure. These findings show the importance of characterizing the phosphorylations state of proteins when heterologously expressed, since their biochemical and physiological properties are dependent on post-translational modification.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThrombosis of the lung micro-vasculature is a characteristic of COVID-19 disease, which is observed in large excess compared to other forms of acute respiratory distress syndrome and thus suggests a trigger for thrombosis endogenous to the lung. Our recent work has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein activates the cellular TMEM16F chloride channel and scramblase. Through a screening on >3,000 FDA/EMA approved drugs, we identified Niclosamide and Clofazimine as the most effective molecules at inhibiting this activity. As TMEM16F plays an important role in the stimulation of the pro-coagulant activity of platelets, and considering that platelet abnormalities are common in COVID-19 patients, we investigated whether Spike directly affects platelet activation and pro-thrombotic function and tested the effect of Niclosamide and Clofazimine on these processes.\n\nMethodsWe produced SARS-CoV-2 Spike or VSV-G protein-pseudotyped virions, or generated cells expressing Spike on their plasma membrane, and tested their effects on platelet adhesion (fluorescence), aggregation (absorbance), exposure of phosphatidylserine (flow cytometry for annexin V binding), calcium flux (flow cytometry for fluo-4 AM), and clot formation and retraction. These experiments were also conducted in the presence of the TMEM16F activity inhibitors Niclosamide and Clofazimine.\n\nResultsHere we show that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Spike promotes platelet activation, adhesion and spreading, both when present on the envelope of virions or upon expression on the plasma membrane of cells. Spike was effective both as a sole agonist or by enhancing the effect of known platelet activators, such as collagen and collagen-related peptide. In particular, Spike exerted a noticeable effect on the procoagulant phenotype of platelets, by enhancing calcium flux, phosphatidylserine externalisation, and thrombin generation. Eventually, this resulted in a striking increase in thrombin-induced clot formation and retraction. Both Niclosamide and Clofazimine almost abolished this Spike-induced pro-coagulant response.\n\nConclusionsTogether, these findings provide a pathogenic mechanism to explain thrombosis associated to COVID-19 lung disease, by which Spike present in SARS-CoV-2 virions or exposed on the surface of infected cells, leads to local platelet stimulation and subsequent activation of the coagulation cascade. As platelet TMEM16F is central in this process, these findings reinforce the rationale of repurposing drugs targeting this protein, such as Niclosamide, for COVID-19 therapy.",

    "abstract": "Favipiravir is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits the replication and transcription of a broad spectrum of RNA viruses, including pathogenic arenaviruses. In this study, we isolated a favipiravir-resistant mutant of Junin virus (JUNV), which is the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever, and analyzed the antiviral mechanism of favipiravir against JUNV. Two amino acid substitutions, N462D in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and A168T in the glycoprotein precursor GPC, were identified in the mutant. GPC-A168T substitution enhanced the efficiency of JUNV internalization, which explains the robust replication kinetics of the mutant in the virus growth analysis. Although RdRp-N462D substitution did not affect polymerase activity levels in a minigenome system, comparisons of RdRp error frequencies showed that the virus with RdRp-D462 possessed a significantly higher fidelity. We also provided experimental evidence for the first time that favipiravir inhibited JUNV through the accumulation of transition mutations, confirming its role as a purine analogue against arenaviruses. Moreover, we showed that treatment with a combination of favipiravir and either ribavirin or remdesivir inhibited JUNV replication in a synergistic manner, blocking the generation of the drug-resistant mutant. Our findings provide new insights for the clinical management and treatment of Argentine hemorrhagic fever.",

Using plant rhizosphere colonization and virulence in a murine abscess model, we show that colR is required for commensalism with plants and virulence in animals. Comparative transcriptomics revealed that the ColR regulon has diverged between P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens and deleting components of the ColR regulon revealed strain-specific, but not hostspecific, requirements for ColR-dependent genes. Collectively, our results suggest that ColR/S allows Pseudomonas to sense and respond to a host, but that the ColR-regulon has diverged between Pseudomonas strains with distinct lifestyles.",

    "abstract": "Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element that is supplemented in microbial media with varying benefits across species and growth conditions. We found that growth of Lactococcus cremoris was unaffected by manganese omission from the growth medium. The main proteome adaptation to manganese omission involved increased manganese transporter production (up to 2000-fold), while the remaining 10 significant proteome changes were between 1.4 and 4 fold. Further investigation in translationally-blocked (TB), non-growing cells showed that Mn supplementation (20 M) led to approximately 1.5X faster acidification compared to Mn-free conditions. However, this faster acidification stagnated within 24 hours, likely due to draining of intracellular NADH that coincides with substantial loss of culturability. Conversely, without manganese, non-growing cells persisted to acidify for weeks, albeit at a reduced rate, but maintaining redox balance and culturability. Strikingly, despite being unculturable, -keto acid-derived aldehydes continued to accumulate in cells incubated in the presence of manganese, whereas without manganese cells predominantly formed the corresponding alcohols. This is most likely reflecting NADH availability for the alcohol dehydrogenase-catalyzed conversion. Overall, manganese influences the lactococcal acidification rate, and flavor formation capacity in a redox dependent manner. These are important industrial traits especially during cheese ripening, where cells are in a non-growing, often unculturable state.",

    "abstract": "The divergence of regulatory regions and gene regulatory network (GRN) rewiring is a key driver of cichlid phenotypic diversity. However, the contribution of miRNA binding site turnover has yet to be linked to GRN evolution across cichlids. Here, we extend our previous studies by analysing the selective constraints driving evolution of miRNA and transcription factor (TF) binding sites of target genes, to infer instances of cichlid GRN rewiring associated with regulatory binding site turnover. Comparative analyses identified increased species-specific networks that are functionally associated to traits of cichlid phenotypic diversity. The evolutionary rewiring is associated with differential models of miRNA and TF binding site turnover, driven by a high proportion of fast-evolving polymorphic sites in adaptive trait genes compared to subsets of random genes. Positive selection acting upon discrete mutations in these regulatory regions is likely to be an important mechanism in rewiring GRNs in rapidly radiating cichlids. Regulatory variants of functionally associated miRNA and TF binding sites of visual opsin genes differentially segregate according to phylogeny and ecology of Lake Malawi species, identifying both rewired e.g. clade-specific and conserved network motifs of adaptive trait associated GRNs. Our approach revealed several novel candidate regulators, regulatory regions and three-node motifs across cichlid genomes with previously reported associations to known adaptive evolutionary traits.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional bursting has been linked to the stochastic positioning of nucleosomes. However, how bursting is regulated by remodeling of promoter nucleosomes is unknown. Here, we use single-molecule live-cell imaging of GAL10 transcription in budding yeast to measure how transcriptional bursting changes upon single and double perturbations of chromatin remodeling factors, the transcription factor Gal4 and preinitiation complex (PIC) components. Using dynamic epistasis analysis, we reveal how remodeling of different nucleosomes regulates individual transcriptional bursting parameters. At the nucleosome covering the Gal4 binding sites, RSC acts synergistically with Gal4 binding to facilitate each burst. Conversely, nucleosome remodeling at the TATA box controls only the first burst upon galactose induction. In the absence of remodelers, nucleosomes at canonical TATA boxes are displaced by TBP binding to allow for transcription activation. Overall, our results reveal how promoter nucleosome remodeling, together with transcription factor and PIC binding regulates the kinetics of transcriptional bursting.",

    "abstract": "The hallmark event of the canonical transforming growth factor {beta} (TGF{beta}) family signaling is the assembly of the Smad-complex, consisting of the common Smad, Smad4, and phosphorylated receptor-regulated Smads. How the Smad-complex is assembled and regulated is still unclear. Here, we report that active Arl15, an Arf-like small G protein, specifically binds to the MH2 domain of Smad4 and colocalizes with Smad4 at the endolysosome. The binding relieves the autoinhibition of Smad4, which is imposed by the intramolecular interaction between its MH1 and MH2 domains. Activated Smad4 subsequently interacts with phosphorylated receptor-regulated Smads, forming the Smad-complex. Our observations suggest that Smad4 functions as an effector and a GTPase activating protein (GAP) of Arl15. Assembly of the Smad-complex enhances the GAP activity of Smad4 toward Arl15, therefore dissociating Arl15 before the nuclear translocation of the Smad-complex. Our data further demonstrate that Arl15 positively regulates the TGF{beta} family signaling.",

Here, we addressed the functional relevance of DNMT3A for differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by knocking out exon 2, 19, or 23. Exon 19-/- and 23-/- lines revealed absence of almost the entire de novo DNA methylation during mesenchymal and hematopoietic differentiation. Yet, differentiation was only slightly reduced in exon 19-/- and increased in exon 23-/- lines, whereas there was no significant impact on gene expression in hematopoietic progenitors (iHPCs). Notably, DNMT3A-/- iHPCs recapitulate some DNA methylation differences of acute myeloid leukemia with DNMT3A mutations. Furthermore, multicolor genetic barcoding revealed competitive growth advantage of exon 23-/- iHPCs. Our results demonstrate that de novo DNA methylation during hematopoietic differentiation of iPSCs is almost entirely dependent on DNMT3A and exon 23-/- iHPCs even gained growth advantage.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic mechanisms leading to new traits is a fundamental goal of evolutionary biology. We show that HOXDB regulatory changes have been used repeatedly in different stickleback fish species to alter the length and number of bony dorsal spines. In Gasterosteus aculeatus, a variant HOXDB allele is genetically linked to shortening an existing spine and adding a spine. In Apeltes quadracus, a variant allele is associated with lengthening an existing spine and adding a spine. The alleles alter the same conserved non-coding HOXDB enhancer by diverse molecular mechanisms, including SNPs, deletions, and transposable element insertions. The independent cis-acting regulatory changes are linked to anterior expansion or contraction of HOXDB expression. Our findings support the long-standing hypothesis that natural Hox gene variation underlies key morphological patterning changes in wild populations and illustrate how different mutational mechanisms affecting the same region may produce opposite gene expression changes with similar phenotypic outcomes.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=154 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/472698v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8e6675org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e89e13org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e1f1dcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cdb6f8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved degradation mechanism of misfolded proteins and damaged organelles which helps maintain cellular homeostasis. Besides its canonical function, proteins of the autophagy pathway also participate in other cellular processes including chromosome congression. Here, we perform a comprehensive screen of autophagy mutants in yeast and found that cells lacking an autophagy-related protein Atg11 have poor mitotic stability of linear and circular chromosomes. atg11{Delta} cells grow slowly at 37{degrees}C and accumulate at metaphase with aberrant astral microtubules (aMTs) along with mispositioned and misaligned spindles. Deletion of the spindle positioning checkpoint (SPOC) factor Bub2, but not the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) component Mad2, could improve the growth of the atg11{Delta} cells. Strikingly, the spindle pole body (SPB) localization pattern of an SPB component Spc72 is found to be randomized in atg11{Delta} cells resulting in inverted SPB inheritance. Atg11 is transiently localized to SPBs and interacts both physically and genetically with Spc72. Taken together, our study uncovers a moonlighting function of Atg11 participating between spatially separated processes, the cell cycle and autophagy, essential for proper spindle positioning and asymmetric SPB inheritance. Our findings, therefore, highlight one of the many failsafe mechanisms likely in place to ensure asymmetric cell division.",

Despite development of a range of techniques to probe PPIs in living systems, there is a dearth of approaches to capture interactions driven by specific post-translational modifications (PTMs).

Here we report design and synthesis of a panel of novel photocrosslinkable and clickable myristic acid analog probes, and their characterization as efficient substrates for human N-myristoyltransferases NMT1 and NMT2, both biochemically and through X-ray co-crystallography. We demonstrate metabolic incorporation of probes to label NMT substrates in cell culture and in situ intracellular photoactivation to form a covalent crosslink between modified proteins and their interactors, capturing a snapshot of interactions driven by the presence of the lipid PTM. Proteomic analyses revealed both known and multiple novel interactors of a series of myristoylated proteins, including ferroptosis suppressor protein FSP1 and spliceosome-associated RNA helicase DDX46.

Following structure determination of the monomeric LH1-RC including its previously unrecognized component designated protein-U (Nat. Commun. 12, 6300, 2021), here we present cryo-EM structures of the dimeric LH1-RC from native Rba. sphaeroides IL106 at 2.75 [A] resolution and from an LH1-RC monomer lacking protein-U ({Delta}U) at 2.64 [A] resolution. The native dimeric core complex reveals many asymmetric features in the arrangement of its two monomeric components including the structural integrity of protein-U, the overall LH1 organization, and the rigidities of the proteins and pigments that form the complex. PufX polypeptides play a critical role in connecting two monomers, with one PufX interacting at its N-terminus with another PufX and an LH1 {beta}-polypeptide in another monomer, in good agreement with biochemical analyses. One of the proteins-U was only partially identified in the dimeric structure, signaling significantly different degrees of disorder in the two monomers. The {Delta}U LH1-RC monomer revealed a half-moon-shaped structure containing 11 - and 10 {beta}-polypeptides (compared with 14 of each in the wild type), indicating a critical role for protein-U in controlling the number of {beta}-subunits required for correct assembly and stabilization of the LH1-RC dimer.

    "abstract": "In human and other metazoans, the determinants of replication origin location and strength are still elusive. Origins are licensed in G1 phase and fired in S phase of the cell cycle, respectively. It is debated which of these two temporally separate steps determines origin efficiency. Experiments can independently profile mean replication timing (MRT) and replication fork directionality (RFD) genome-wide. Such profiles contain information on multiple origins properties and on fork speed. Due to possible origin inactivation by passive replication, however, observed and intrinsic origin efficiencies can markedly differ. Thus, there is a need for methods to infer intrinsic from observed origin efficiency, which is context-dependent. Here, we show that MRT and RFD data are highly consistent with each other but contain information at different spatial scales. Using neural networks, we infer an origin licensing landscape that, when inserted in an appropriate simulation framework, jointly predicts MRT and RFD data with unprecedented precision and underlies the importance of dispersive origin firing. We furthermore uncover an analytical formula that predicts intrinsic from observed origin efficiency combined with MRT data. Comparison of inferred intrinsic origin efficiencies with experimental profiles of licensed origins (ORC, MCM) and actual initiation events (Bubble-seq, SNS-seq, OK-seq, ORM) show that intrinsic origin efficiency is not solely determined by licensing efficiency. Thus, human replication origin efficiency is set at both the origin licensing and firing steps.\n\nAuthor SummaryDNA replication is a vital process that produces two identical replicas of DNA from one DNA molecule, ensuring the faithful transmission of genetic information from mother to daughter cells. The synthesis of new DNA strands initiates at multiple sites, termed replication origins, propagates bidirectionally, and terminates by merging of converging strands. Replication initiation continues in unreplicated DNA but is blocked in replicated DNA. Experiments have only given partial information about origin usage. In this work we reveal the exact propensity of any site to initiate replication along human chromosomes. First, we simulate the DNA replication process using approximate origin information, predict the direction and time of replication at each point of the genome, and train a neural network to precisely recover from the predictions the starting origin information. Second, we apply this network to real replication time and direction data, extracting the replication initiation propensity landscape that exactly predicts them. We compare this landscape to independent origin usage data, benchmarking them, and to landscapes of protein factors that mark potential origins. We find that the local abundance of such factors is insufficient to predict replication initiation and we infer to which extent other chromosomal cues locally influence potential origin usage.",

    "abstract": "The determination of three dimensional structures of macromolecules is one of the actual challenge in biology with the ultimate objective of understanding their function. So far, X-ray crystallography is the most popular method to solve structure, but this technique relies on the generation of diffracting crystals. Once a correct data set has been obtained, the calculation of electron density maps requires to solve the so-called <<phase problem >> using different approaches. The most frequently used technique is molecular replacement, which relies on the availability of the structure of a protein sharing strong structural similarity with the studied protein. Its success rate is directly correlated with the quality of the models used for the molecular replacement trials. The availability of models as accurate as possible is then definitely critical.\n\nVery recently, a breakthrough step has been made in the field of protein structure prediction thanks to the use of machine learning approaches as implemented in the AlphaFold or RoseTTAFold structure prediction programs. Here, we describe how these recent improvements helped us to solve the crystal structure of a protein involved in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway (NMD), an mRNA quality control pathway dedicated to the elimination of eukaryotic mRNAs harboring premature stop codons.",

Mechanistic models that account for short-term population dynamics can improve prediction because they incorporate differing demographic processes that link the environmental conditions of a spatial location explicitly with the invasion process. Yet short-term population dynamics are rarely accounted for in spatial models of invasive species spread.\n\nAccounting for transient population dynamics, we predict the population growth rate and establishment probability of wild pigs following introduction into any location in North America. We compared predicted population growth rate with observed geographic rates of spread and found significant relationships between the annual rate of spread and population growth rates.\n\nWe used geospatial data on the distribution of mast producing tree species (a principle forage resource of wild pigs) and agricultural crops that can replace mast in their diets to predict population dynamics using transient population simulations. We simulated populations under different initial population sizes (i.e. number of introduced individuals, often termed propagule size) and for different amounts of time following introduction. By varying the initial population size and simulation time, we were able to identify areas in North America with high probability for establishment of wild pigs if introduced. Our findings can be used to inform surveillance and removal efforts to reduce the potential for establishment and spread of wild pigs.",
