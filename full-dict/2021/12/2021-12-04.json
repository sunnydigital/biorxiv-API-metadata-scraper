    "abstract": "T cell exhaustion is one of the main reasons of tumor immune escape. Using single cell transcriptome data of CD8+ T cells in multiple cancers, we identified different cell types, in which Pre_exhaust and exhausted T cells participated in negative regulation of immune system process. By analyzing the co-expression network patterns and differentially expressed genes of Pre_exhaust, exhausted and effector T cells, we identified 35 genes related to T cell exhaustion, which high GSVA scores were associated with significantly poor prognosis in various cancers. In the differentially expressed genes, RGS1 showed the greatest fold change in Pre_exhaust and exhausted cells of three cancers compared with effector T cells, and high expression of RGS1 was also associated with poor prognosis in various cancers. Additionally, RGS1 protein was upregulated significantly in tumor tissues in the immunohistochemistry verification. Furthermore, RGS1 displayed positive correlation with the 35 genes, especially highly correlated with PDCD1, CTLA4, HAVCR2 and TNFRSF9 in CD8+ T cells and cancer tissues, indicating important roles of RGS1 in CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Considering the GTP-hydrolysis activity of RGS1 and significantly high mRNA and protein expression in cancer tissues, we speculated that RGS1 potentially mediate the T cell retention to lead to the persistent antigen stimulation, resulting in T cell exhaustion. In conclusion, our findings suggest that RGS1 is a new marker and promoting factor for CD8+ T cell exhaustion, and provide theoretical basis for research and immunotherapy of exhausted cells.",

    "abstract": "Scientific research is shedding light on the interaction of the gut microbiome with the human host and on its role in human health state. Existing machine learning methods have shown great potential in discriminating healthy from diseased microbiome states. Most of them leverage shotgun metagenomic sequencing to extract gut microbial species-relative abundances or strain-level markers. Each of these gut microbial features showed diagnostic potential when tested separately; however, no existing approach combines them in a single predictive framework. Here, we propose the Multimodal Variational Information Bottleneck (MVIB), a novel deep learning model capable of learning a joint representation of multiple heterogeneous data modalities. MVIB achieves competitive classification performance while being faster than existing methods. Additionally, MVIB offers interpretable results. Our model adopts an information theoretic interpretation of deep neural networks and computes a joint stochastic encoding of different input data modalities. We use MVIB to predict whether human hosts are affected by a certain disease by jointly analysing gut microbial species-relative abundances and strain-level markers. MVIB is evaluated on human gut metagenomic samples from 11 publicly available disease cohorts covering 6 different diseases. We achieve high performance (0.80 < ROC AUC < 0.95) on 5 cohorts and at least medium performance on the remaining ones. We adopt a saliency technique to interpret the output of MVIB and identify the most relevant microbial species and strain-level markers to the models predictions. We also perform cross-study generalisation experiments, where we train and test MVIB on different cohorts of the same disease, and overall we achieve comparable results to the baseline approach. Further, we evaluate our model by adding metabolomic data derived from mass spectrometry as a third input modality. Our method is scalable with respect to input data modalities and has an average training time of < 1.4 seconds. The source code and the datasets used in this work are publicly available.\n\nAuthor summaryThe gut microbiome can be an indicator of various diseases due to its interaction with the human system. Our main objective is to improve on the current state of the art in microbiome classification for diagnostic purposes. A rich body of literature evidences the clinical value of microbiome predictive models. Here, we propose the Multimodal Variational Information Bottleneck (MVIB), a novel deep learning model for microbiome-based disease prediction. MVIB learns a joint stochastic encoding of different input data modalities to predict the output class. We use MVIB to predict whether human hosts are affected by a certain disease by jointly analysing gut microbial species-relative abundance and strain-level marker profiles. Both of these gut microbial features showed diagnostic potential when tested separately in previous studies; however, no research has combined them in a single predictive tool. We evaluate MVIB on various human gut metagenomic samples from 11 publicly available disease cohorts. MVIB achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we evaluate our model by adding metabolomic data as a third input modality and we show that MVIB is scalable with respect to input feature modalities. Further, we adopt a saliency technique to interpret the output of MVIB and identify the most relevant microbial species and strain-level markers to our model predictions.",

A typical phage particle is at least an order of magnitude larger than an antibiotic molecule. Hence, phages diffuse slower than antibiotics, and can also get trapped in the polymeric mesh of biofilm matrix. By tracking fluorescently labeled lambda phages that do not infect Capnocytophaga gingivalis, a bacterium abundant in the human oral microbiota, we demonstrate active phage transportation by a C. gingivalis swarm. As a result, the rate of disruption of the prey of lambda phage i.e., an Escherichia coli colony, increases 10 times. C. gingivalis drills tunnels within a curli fiber containing E. coli biofilm and increase the efficiency of phage penetration. This provides evidence for a novel mechanism of phage-bacterial warfare.",

We evaluated 20 protein biomarkers on 14 TMAs with prospectively collected tumor tissue from 1,448 primary prostate cancers. In half of the biomarkers, more than 10% of biomarker variance was attributable to between-TMA differences (range, 1-48%). We implemented different methods to mitigate batch effects (R package batchtma), tested in plasmode simulation. Biomarker levels were more similar between mitigation approaches compared to uncorrected values. For some biomarkers, associations with clinical features changed substantially after addressing batch effects. Batch effects and resulting bias are not an error of an individual study but an inherent feature of TMA-based protein biomarker studies.

    "abstract": "Short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) are a convenient class of enzymes used to synthesize enantiopure alcohols. Several studies describe native or engineered SDRs for converting substrates of interest using cost and time-intensive high-throughput approaches. The classification of SDRs is based on chain length and cofactor binding site. Of these, the shorter  Classical and the longer  Extended enzymes participate in ketoreduction. However, comparative analysis of various modelled SDRs reveals a length independent conserved N-terminal Rossmann fold and a variable C-terminus region for both types. The general hypothesis is that the latter domain influences the enzymes flexibility that may affect the observed promiscuity of the enzyme. We have used a machine learning algorithm on this flexible domain to build a rationale to screen promiscuous candidates. We have built a data set consisting of physicochemical properties derived from the amino-acid composition of enzymes to select closely associated promiscuous mesophilic enzymes. The resulting in vitro studies on pro-pharmaceutical substrates illustrate a direct correlation between the C-terminal lid-loop structure, enzyme melting temperature and the turnover number. We present a walkthrough for exploring promiscuous SDRs for catalyzing enantiopure alcohols of industrial importance.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic recently entered an alarming new phase with the emergence of the variants of concern (VOC) and understanding their biology is paramount to predicting future ones. Current efforts mainly focus on mutations in the spike glycoprotein (S), but changes in other regions of the viral proteome are likely key. We analyzed more than 900,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes with a computational systems biology approach including a haplotype network and protein structural analyses to reveal lineage-defining mutations and their critical functional attributes. Our results indicate that increased transmission is promoted by epistasis, i.e., combinations of mutations in S and other viral proteins. Mutations in the non-S proteins involve immune-antagonism and replication performance, suggesting convergent evolution. Furthermore, adaptive mutations appear in geographically disparate locations, suggesting that either independent, repeat mutation events or recombination among different strains are generating VOC. We demonstrate that recombination is a stronger hypothesis, and may be accelerating the emergence of VOC by bringing together cooperative mutations. This emphasizes the importance of a global response to stop the COVID-19 pandemic.",

To mitigate increased energy costs associated with reproduction, female mammals have evolved behavioural and physiological responses. Some species alter activity to conserve energy during pregnancy and lactation, while others experience changes in metabolism and fat deposition. Restructuring of gut microbiota with shifting reproductive states may also help females increase energy harvest from foods, especially during pregnancy. Here, we combine life history data with >13,000 behavioural scans and >300 fecal samples collected longitudinally across multiple years from 33 white-faced capuchin monkey females to examine the relationships among behaviour, gut microbiota composition, and reproductive state. We used 16S-based amplicon sequencing and the DADA2 pipeline to analyze microbial diversity and putative functions. Reproductive state explained some variation in activity, but overall resting and foraging behaviours were relatively stable across the reproductive cycle. We found evidence for increases in biotin synthesis pathways among microbes in lactating females, and that relatoe abundance of major phyla among the states was small but significant. Otherwise, gut microbiota structure and estimated functions were not substantially different among reproductive states. These data contribute to a broader understanding of plasticity in response to physiological shifts associated with mammalian reproduction.",

    "abstract": "Oryza longistaminata, a wild rice, vegetatively reproduces and forms a networked clonal colony consisting of ramets connected by rhizomes. Although water, nutrients, and other molecules can be transferred between ramets via the rhizomes, inter-ramet communication in response to spatially heterogeneous nitrogen availability is not well understood. We studied the response of ramet pairs to heterogeneous nitrogen availability by using a split hydroponic system that allowed each ramet root to be exposed to different conditions. Ammonium uptake was compensatively enhanced in the sufficient-side root when roots of the ramet pairs were exposed to ammonium-sufficient and deficient conditions. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that a gene regulatory network for effective ammonium assimilation and amino acid biosynthesis was activated in the sufficient-side roots. Allocation of absorbed nitrogen from the nitrogen-sufficient to the deficient ramets was rather limited. Nitrogen was preferentially used for newly growing axillary buds on the sufficient-side ramets. Biosynthesis of trans-zeatin, a cytokinin, was up-regulated in response to the nitrogen supply, but trans-zeatin appears not to target the compensatory regulation. Our results also implied that the O. longistaminata ortholog of OsCEP1 plays a role as a nitrogen-deficient signal in inter-ramet communication, providing compensatory up-regulation of nitrogen assimilatory genes. These results provide insights into the molecular basis for efficient growth strategies of asexually proliferating plants growing in areas where the distribution of ammonium ions is spatially heterogeneous.\n\nOne sentence summaryOryza longistaminata, a rhizomatous wild rice, systemically regulates ammonium acquisition and use in response to spatially heterogeneous nitrogen availability via inter-ramet communication.",

These asymmetries are not alleviated by covert exogenous or endogenous attention, but have been studied exclusively during eye fixation. However, a major driver of everyday attentional orienting is saccade preparation, during which visual attention automatically shifts to the future eye fixation. This presaccadic shift of attention is considered strong and compulsory, and relies on fundamentally different neural computations and substrates than covert attention. Given these differences, we investigated whether presaccadic attention can compensate for the ubiquitous performance asymmetries observed during eye fixation. Our data replicate polar performance asymmetries during fixation and document the same asymmetries during saccade preparation. Crucially, however, presaccadic attention enhanced contrast sensitivity at the horizontal and lower vertical meridian, but not at the upper vertical meridian. Thus, instead of attenuating polar performance asymmetries, presaccadic attention exacerbates them.",

The systemic administration of TNF- increased carotid body afferent discharge and activated glutamatergic neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) that project to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), where the majority of pre-sympathetic neurons reside. The activation of these neurons was accompanied by generalized activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Carotid body ablation blunted the TNF--induced activation of RVLM-projecting NTS neurons and the increase in splanchnic sympathetic nerve activity. Finally, plasma and spleen levels of cytokines after TNF- administration were higher in rats subjected to either carotid body ablation or splanchnic sympathetic denervation. Collectively, our findings indicate that the carotid body detects circulating TNF- to activate a counteracting sympathetic anti-inflammatory mechanism.",

This issue is especially pressing for neurodegenerative diseases, where the development of disease-modifying drugs has been particularly challenging. To address this problem, we describe here a machine learning approach to identify small molecule inhibitors of -synuclein aggregation, a process implicated in Parkinsons disease and other synucleinopathies. Because the proliferation of -synuclein aggregates takes place through autocatalytic secondary nucleation, we aim to identify compounds that bind the catalytic sites on the surface of the aggregates. To achieve this goal, we use structure-based machine learning in an iterative manner to first identify and then progressively optimize secondary nucleation inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that this approach leads to the facile identification of compounds two orders of magnitude more potent than previously reported ones.",

    "abstract": "Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is a model microorganism for the study of Streptomycetes, antibiotic production, and secondary metabolism in general. Even though S. coelicolor has an outstanding variety of regulators among bacteria, little effort to globally study its transcription has been made. We manually curated 29 years of literature and databases to assemble a meta-curated experimentally-validated gene regulatory network (GRN) with 5386 genes and 9707 regulatory interactions ([~]41% of the total expected interactions). This provides the most extensive and up-to-date reconstruction available for the regulatory circuitry of this organism. Only [~]6% (534/9707) are supported by experiments confirming the binding of the transcription factor to the upstream region of the target gene, the so-called \"strong\" evidence. While for the remaining interactions there is no confirmation of direct binding. To tackle network incompleteness, we performed network inference using several methods (including two proposed here) for motif identification in DNA sequences and GRN inference from transcriptomics. Further, we contrasted the structural properties and functional architecture of the networks to assess the reliability of the predictions, finding the inference from DNA sequence data to be the most trustworthy approach. Finally, we show two applications of the inferred and the curated networks. The inference allowed us to propose novel transcription factors for the key Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory proteins (SARPs). The curated network allowed us to study the conservation of the system-level components between S. coelicolor and Corynebacterium glutamicum. There we identified the basal machinery as the common signature between the two organisms. The curated networks were deposited in Abasy Atlas (https://abasy.ccg.unam.mx/) while the inferences are available as Supplementary Material.",

    "abstract": "Natural evolution is driven by random mutations that improve fitness. In vitro evolution mimics this process, however, on a short time-scale and is driven by the given bait. Here, we used directed in vitro evolution of a random library of Uracil glycosylase (eUNG) displayed on yeast surface to select for binding to chaperones GroEL, DnaK+DnaJ+ATP (DnaKJ) or E.coli cell extract (CE). Using binding to the eUNG inhibitor Ugi as probe for native foldedess, the CE selected population was further divided to Ugi binders (+U) (native) or non-binders (-U). We found that GroEL, DnaKJ and CE-U select and enrich for mutations causing eUNG to misfold, with the three being enriched in mutations in buried and conserved positions, with a tendency to increase positive charge. Still, each selection, as well as CE+U and natural evolution of eUNG has its own trajectory. While GroEL and CE-U selected for mutants highly sensitive to protease cleavage, DnaKJ selected for partially structured misfolded species with a tendency to refold, making them less sensitive to proteases. CE+U selected for more neutral mutations than natural evolution. In a more general context, our results show that GroEL has a higher tendency to purge promiscuous misfolded protein mutants from the system, while DnaKJ binds mutants misfolding-prone species that are, upon chaperone release, more likely to natively refold. CE-U shares some of the properties of GroEL and DnaKJ selected populations, while harboring also unique properties, explained by the existence of additional chaperones in CE, such as Tig, HtpG and ClpB.",

Tactoids of filamentous Pf bacteriophage, such as those produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have been linked with increased antibiotic tolerance. We modelled this system and show that tactoids, composed of filamentous Pf virions, can lead to antibiotic tolerance by acting as an adsorptive diffusion barrier. The continuum model, reminiscent of descriptions of reactive diffusion in porous media, has been solved numerically and good agreement was found with the analytical results, obtained using a homogenisation approach. We find that the formation of tactoids significantly increases antibiotic diffusion times leading to stronger antibiotic resistance.",

The molecular mechanisms underlying this region-specific neuronal degeneration and how these relate to the development of early cognitive phenotypes are poorly understood. Here, we show that there is selective loss of synaptic connections between the cortex and striatum in postmortem tissue from HD patients that is associated with the increased activation and localization of complement proteins, innate immune molecules, to markers of these synaptic elements. We also find that levels of these secreted innate immune molecules are elevated in the CSF of premanifest HD patients and correlate with established measures of disease burden.\n\nIn preclinical genetic models of HD we show that complement proteins mediate the selective elimination of corticostriatal synapses at an early stage in disease pathogenesis marking them for removal by microglia, the brains resident macrophage population. This process requires mutant huntingtin to be expressed in both cortical and striatal neurons and inhibition of this complement-dependent elimination mechanism through administration of a therapeutically relevant C1q function blocking antibody or genetic ablation of a complement receptor on microglia, prevented synapse loss, increased excitatory input to the striatum and rescued the early development of visual discrimination learning and cognitive flexibility deficits in these models. Together, our findings implicate microglia and the complement cascade in the selective, early degeneration of corticostriatal synapses and the development of cognitive deficits in presymptomatic HD, and also provide new preclinical data to support complement as a therapeutic target for early intervention.",

    "abstract": "Cryo-soft-X-ray tomography is being increasingly used in biological research to study the morphology of cellular compartments and how they change in response to different stimuli, such as viral infections. Segmentation of these compartments is limited by time-consuming manual tools or machine learning algorithms that require extensive time and effort to train. Here we describe Contour, a new, easy-to-use, highly automated segmentation tool that enables accelerated segmentation of tomograms to delineate distinct cellular compartments. Using Contour, cellular structures can be segmented based on their projection intensity and geometrical width by applying a threshold range to the image and excluding noise smaller in width than the cellular compartments of interest. This method is less laborious and less prone to errors from human judgement than current tools that require features to be manually traced, and does not require training datasets as would machine-learning driven segmentation. We show that high-contrast compartments such as mitochondria, lipid droplets, and features at the cell surface can be easily segmented with this technique in the context of investigating herpes simplex virus 1 infection. Contour can extract geometric measurements from 3D segmented volumes, providing a new method to quantitate cryo-soft-X-ray tomography data. Contour can be freely downloaded at github.com/kamallouisnahas/Contour.\n\nImpact StatementMore research groups are using cryo-soft-X-ray tomography as a correlative imaging tool to study the ultrastructure of cells and tissues but very few tomograms are segmented with existing segmentation programs. Segmentation is usually a prerequisite for measuring the geometry of features in tomograms but the time- and labour-intensive nature of current segmentation techniques means that such measurements are rarely across a large number of tomograms, as is required for robust statistical analysis. Contour has been designed to facilitate the automation of segmentation and, as a result, reduce manual effort and increase the number of tomograms that can be segmented. Because it requires minimal manual intervention, Contour is not as prone to human error as programs that require the users to trace the edges of cellular features. Geometry measurements of the segmented volumes can be calculated using this program, providing a new platform to quantitate cryoSXT data. Contour also supports quantitation of volumes imported from other segmentation programs. The generation of a large sample of segmented volumes with Contour that can be used as a representative training dataset for machine learning applications is a long-term aspiration of this technique.",

    "abstract": "To maintain stable DNA concentrations, proliferating cells need to coordinate DNA replication with cell growth. For nuclear DNA, eukaryotic cells achieve this by coupling DNA replication to cell cycle progression, ensuring that DNA is doubled exactly once per cell cycle. By contrast, mitochondrial DNA replication is typically not strictly coupled to the cell cycle, leaving the open question of how cells maintain the correct amount of mitochondrial DNA during cell growth. Here, we show that in budding yeast, mitochondrial DNA copy number increases with cell volume, both in asynchronously cycling populations and during G1 arrest. Our findings suggest that cell-volume-dependent mitochondrial DNA maintenance is achieved through nuclear encoded limiting factors, including the mitochondrial DNA polymerase Mip1 and the packaging factor Abf2, whose amount increases in proportion to cell volume. By directly linking mitochondrial DNA maintenance to nuclear protein synthesis, and thus cell growth, constant mitochondrial DNA concentrations can be robustly maintained without a need for cell-cycle-dependent regulation.",

    "abstract": "Tumor Protein D54 (TPD54) is an abundant cytosolic protein that belongs to the TPD52 family, a family of four proteins (TPD52, 53, 54 and 55) that are overexpressed in several cancer cells. Even though the functions of these proteins remain elusive, recent investigations indicate that TPD54 binds to very small cytosolic vesicles with a diameter of ca. 30 nm, half the size of classical transport vesicles (e.g. COPI and COPII). Here, we investigated the mechanism of intracellular nanovesicle capture by TPD54. Bioinformatical analysis suggests that TPD54 contains a small coiled-coil followed by several amphipathic helices, which could fold upon binding to lipid membranes. One of these helices has the physicochemical features of an Amphipathic Lipid Packing Sensor (ALPS) motif, which, in other proteins, enables membrane binding in a curvature-dependent manner. Limited proteolysis, CD spectroscopy, tryptophan fluorescence and cysteine mutagenesis coupled to covalent binding of a membrane sensitive probe show that binding of TPD54 to small liposomes is accompanied by large structural changes in the amphipathic helix region. TPD54 binding to artificial liposomes is very sensitive to liposome size and to lipid unsaturation but is poorly dependent on lipid charge. Cellular investigations confirmed the key role of the ALPS motif in vesicle targeting. Surprisingly, the vesicles selected by TPD54 poorly overlap with those captured by the golgin GMAP-210, a long vesicle tether at the Golgi apparatus, which displays a dimeric coiled-coil architecture and an N-terminal ALPS motif. We propose that TPD54 recognizes nanovesicles through a combination of ALPS-dependent and -independent mechanisms.",

Here we used lineage tracing to demonstrate the shared ontogeny between fetal brain macrophages (microglia) and fetal placental macrophages (Hofbauer cells). Single-cell RNA sequencing of murine fetal brain and placental macrophages demonstrated shared transcriptional programs. Comparison with human datasets demonstrated that placental resident macrophage signatures are highly conserved between mice and humans. Single-cell RNA-seq identified sex differences in fetal microglial and Hofbauer cell programs, and robust differences between placenta-associated maternal macrophage/monocyte (PAMM) populations in the context of a male versus a female fetus. We propose that Hofbauer cells, which are easily accessible at birth, provide novel insights into fetal brain microglial programs, potentially facilitating the early identification of offspring most vulnerable to neurodevelopmental disorders.",

However, following adult injury to the ureter by xanthine stones, RSCs remodel the damaged region in a similar manner. Thus, RSCs represent stem cells encoding a developmental redesign. The remodeled tubules have a larger luminal diameter and shorter brush border, changes linked to enhanced stone resistance. However, RSC-mediated modifications also raise salt sensitivity and reduce fecundity.

Here, we developed a method to visualize TERRA in live cells via a combination of CRISPR Cas13 RNA labeling and Suntag technology. Single-particle tracking reveals that TERRA foci undergo anomalous diffusion in a manner that depends on the timescale and telomeric localization. Furthermore, we used a chemically-induced protein dimerization system to manipulate TERRA subcellular localization in live cells. Overall, our approaches to monitor and control TERRA locations in live cells provide powerful tools to better understand its roles in telomere maintenance and genomic integrity.",

In particular, DPAGT1-CDG is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the first step in N-glycosylation, DPAGT1, and this disorder currently lacks effective therapies. To identify potential therapeutic targets for DPAGT1-CDG, we performed CRISPR knockout screens in Drosophila cells for genes associated with better survival and glycoprotein levels under DPAGT1 inhibition. We identified hundreds of candidate genes that may be of therapeutic benefit. Intriguingly, inhibition of the mannosyltransferase Dpm1, or its downstream glycosylation pathways, could rescue two in vivo models of DPAGT1 inhibition and ER stress, even though impairment of these pathways alone usually cause CDGs. While both in vivo models ostensibly cause ER stress (through DPAGT1 inhibition or a misfolded protein), we found a novel difference in fructose metabolism that may indicate glycolysis as a modulator of DPAGT1-CDG. Our results provide new therapeutic targets for DPAGT1-CDG, include the unique finding of Dpm1-related pathways rescuing DPAGT1 inhibition, and reveal a novel interaction between fructose metabolism and ER stress.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are interspersed repeats that contribute to more than half of the human genome, and TE-embedded regulatory sequences are increasingly recognized as major components of the human regulome. Perturbations of this system can contribute to tumorigenesis, but the impact of TEs on gene expression in cancer cells remains to be fully assessed. Here, we analyzed 275 normal colon and 276 colorectal cancer (CRC) samples from the SYSCOL colorectal cancer cohort and discovered 10,111 and 5,152 TE expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in normal and tumor tissues, respectively. Amongst the latter, 376 were exclusive to CRC, likely driven by changes in methylation patterns. We identified that transcription factors are more enriched in tumor-specific TE-eQTLs than shared TE-eQTLs, indicating that TEs are more specifically regulated in tumor than normal. Using Bayesian Networks to assess the causal relationship between eQTL variants, TEs and genes, we identified that 1,758 TEs are mediators of genetic effect, altering the expression of 1,626 nearby genes significantly more in tumor compared to normal, of which 51 are cancer driver genes. We show that tumor-specific TE-eQTLs trigger the driver capability of TEs subsequently impacting expression of nearby genes. Collectively, our results highlight a global profile of a new class of cancer drivers, thereby enhancing our understanding of tumorigenesis and providing potential new candidate mechanisms for therapeutic target development.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal instability is a hallmark of cancer, but also an instigator of aneuploidy-induced stress, reducing cellular fitness. To better understand how cells with CIN adjust to aneuploidy and adopt a malignant fate in vivo, we performed a genome-wide mutagenesis screen in mice. We find that specifically aneuploid tumors inactivate Stat1 signaling in combination with increased Myc activity. By contrast, loss of p53 is common, but not enriched in CIN tumors. Validation in another tissue type confirmed that CIN promotes immune cell infiltration, which is alleviated by Stat1 loss combined with Myc activation, but not with p53 inactivation, or Myc activation alone. Importantly, we find that this mechanism is preserved in human aneuploid cancers. We conclude that aneuploid cancers inactivate Stat1 signaling to circumvent immune surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Alstrom syndrome (AS) is a rare multi-system disorder for which early-onset childhood obesity is a cardinal feature. Like humans with AS, animal models with Alms1 loss-of-function mutations develop obesity, supporting the notion that ALMS1/Alms1 is required for the regulatory control of energy balance across species. This study aimed to determine which component(s) of energy balance are reliant on Alms1. Here, we performed comprehensive energy balance phenotyping Alms1tvrm102 mice at both eight- and eighteen-weeks-of-age. We found that adiposity gains occurred early and rapidly in Alms1tvrm102 male mice but much later in females. Rapid increases in body fat in males was due to a marked reduction in energy expenditure (EE) during early life and not due to any genotype-specific increases in energy intake under chow conditions. Energy intake did increase in a genotype-specific manner when mice were provided a high-fat-diet, exacerbating the effects of reduced EE on obesity progression. The EE deficit observed in male Alms1tvrm102 mice did not persist as mice aged, suggesting loss of Alms1 either causes a developmental delay in the mechanisms controlling early life EE, or that activation of compensatory mechanisms occurs after obesity is established. Future studies will determine how ALMS1/Alms1 modulates EE and how sex moderates this process.",

Moench), a global staple food and forage crop, is among the most drought-adapted cereal crops, but its adaptation is not yet well understood. This study aims to better understand the genetic basis of preflowering drought in sorghum and identify loci underlying variation in water use and yield components under drought. A panel of 219 diverse sorghum from West Africa was phenotyped for yield components and water use in an outdoor large-tube lysimeter system under well-watered (WW) versus a preflowering drought water-stressed (WS) treatment. The experimental system was validated based on characteristic drought response in international drought tolerance check genotypes and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that mapped the major height locus at QHT7.1 and Dw3. GWAS further identified marker trait associations (MTAs) for drought-related traits (plant height, flowering time, forage biomass, grain weight, water use) that each explained 7-70% of phenotypic variance. Most MTAs for drought-related traits correspond to loci not previously reported, but some MTA for forage biomass and grain weight under WS co-localized with staygreen post-flowering drought tolerance loci (Stg3a and Stg4). A globally common allele at S7_50055849 is associated with several yield components under drought, suggesting that it tags a major pleiotropic variant controlling assimilate partitioning to grain versus vegetative biomass. The GWAS findings revealed oligogenic variants for drought tolerance in sorghum landraces which could be used as trait predictive markers for improved drought adaptation.",

Understanding the dehydration-rehydration behavior of pectin gels may shed light on the water transport and mechanics of plant cells. In this work, we report the contributions of microstructure to the mechanics of pectin-Ca gels subjected to different extents of dehydration and subsequent rehydration. This is investigated using a pectin gel composition that forms  egg-box bundles, a characteristic feature of the microstructure of low methoxy pectin-Ca gels. Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (LAOS) rheology along with Small Angle Neutron Scattering and Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy on pectin gels are used to elucidate the mechanical and microstructural changes during dehydration-rehydration cycles. As the extent of dehydration increase, the reswelling ability, strain-stiffening behavior and the yield strain decreases. These effects are more prominent at faster rates of dehydration and are not completely reversible upon rehydration to the initial undried state. Microstructural changes due to the aggregation of egg-box bundles and single chains and the associated changes in the water configurations lead to these irreversible changes.",

Longitudinal two-photon imaging in vivo indicated that over 90% of both presynaptic and source cells survived for the full twelve-week course of imaging. Ex vivo whole-cell recordings at 5 weeks postinfection showed that the second-generation system perturbs input and source cells much less than does the first-generation system.

    "abstract": "Lymphocyte numbers naturally change through age. Normalisation functions to account for this are sparse, and mostly disregard measurements from children in which these changes are most prominent. In this study, we analyse cross-sectional numbers of mainly T-lymphocytes (CD3+, CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+) and their subpopulations (naive and memory) from 673 healthy Dutch individuals ranging from infancy to adulthood (0-62 years). We fitted the data by a delayed exponential function and received parameter estimates for each lymphocyte subset. Our modelling approach follows general laboratory measurement procedures in which absolute cell counts of T-lymphocyte subsets are calculated from observed percentages within a reference population that is truly counted (typically the total lymphocyte count). Consequently, we receive one set of parameter estimates per T-cell subset representing both the trajectories of their counts and percentages. We allow for an initial time delay of half a year before the total lymphocyte counts per {micro}l of blood start to change exponentially, and we find that T-lymphocyte trajectories tend to increase during the first half a year of life. Thus, our study provides functions describing the general trajectories of T-lymphocyte counts and percentages of the Dutch population. These functions provide important references to study T-lymphocyte dynamics in disease, and allow one to quantify losses and gains in longitudinal data, such as the CD4+ T-cell decline in HIV-infected children, and/or the rate of T-cell recovery after the onset of treatment.",

    "abstract": "Fc{gamma}RIIB is an inhibitory receptor expressed throughout B cell development. Diminished expression or function is associated with lupus in mice and humans, in particular through an effect on autoantibody production and plasma cell differentiation. Here, we analysed the effect of B cell-intrinsic Fc{gamma}RIIB expression on B cell activation and plasma cell differentiation.\n\nLoss of Fc{gamma}RIIB on B cells (Fcgr2b cKO mice) led to a spontaneous increase in autoantibody titers. This increase was most striking for IgG3, suggestive of increased extrafollicular responses. Marginal zone (MZ) and IgG3+ B cells had the highest expression of Fc{gamma}RIIB and the increase in serum IgG3 was linked to increased MZ B cell signaling and activation in the absence of Fc{gamma}RIIB. Likewise, human circulating MZ-like B cells had the highest expression of Fc{gamma}RIIB, and their activation was most strongly inhibited by engaging Fc{gamma}RIIB. Finally, marked increases in IgG3+ plasma cells and B cells were observed during extrafollicular plasma cell responses with both T-dependent and T-independent antigens in Fcgr2b cKO mice. The increased IgG3 response following immunization of Fcgr2b cKO mice was lost in MZ-deficient Notch2/Fcgr2b cKO mice.\n\nThus, we present a model where high Fc{gamma}RIIB expression in MZ B cells prevents their hyperactivation and ensuing autoimmunity.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/471075v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (12K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10bf17corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11b067aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1465e36org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d3351c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "A major goal in microbial ecology is to predict how microbial communities will respond to global change. However, DNA-based sequencing that is intended to characterize live microbial communities includes extracellular DNA (exDNA) from non-viable cells. This could obscure relevant microbial responses, particularly to pulse disturbances which kill bacteria and have disproportionate effects on ecosystems. Here, we characterize bacterial communities before and after a drying-rewetting pulse disturbance, using an improved method for exDNA exclusion. We find that exDNA removal is important for detecting subtle yet significant changes in microbial abundance, diversity, and community composition across the disturbance. However, inclusion of exDNA did not obscure results to a large extent, only sometimes altering statistical significance but rarely changing the direction of the response or general conclusions about bacterial disturbance dynamics. Although there may be instances where exDNA removal is essential for accurate representation of microbial communities, our study suggests these scenarios will be difficult to predict a priori. Overall, we found no evidence that certain time points across the distrubance were more affected by exDNA inclusion, nor did the size or composition of exDNA pools accurately predict when exDNA would alter significance levels. However, exDNA dynamics did vary strongly across the two soil types tested.",

These fungi grow in xeric, nutrient deplete environments which implies that they require highly flexible metabolisms and have been suggested to contain the ability to form lichen-like mutualisms with nearby algae and bacteria. However, the exact ecological niche and interactions between these fungi and their surrounding community is not well understood. We have isolated two novel black yeasts from the genus Exophiala that were recovered from dryland biological soil crusts. Despite notable differences in colony and cellular morphology, both fungi appear to be members of the same species, which has been named Exophiala viscosa (i.e., E. viscosa JF 03-3 Goopy and E. viscosa JF 03-4F Slimy). A combination of whole genome sequencing, phenotypic experiments, and melanin regulation experiments have been performed on these isolates to fully characterize these fungi and help decipher their fundamental niches within the biological soil crust consortium. Our results reveal that E. viscosa is capable of utilizing a wide variety of carbon and nitrogen sources potentially derived from symbiotic microbes, can withstand many forms of abiotic stresses, and excrete melanin that can potentially provide UV resistance to the biological soil crust community. Besides the identification of a novel species within the genus Exophiala, our study also provides new insight into the regulation of melanin production in polyextremotolerant fungi.",

    "abstract": "The existence of naturally occurring ribosome heterogeneity is now a well-acknowledged phenomenon. However, whether this heterogeneity leads to functionally diverse  specialized ribosomes is still a controversial topic. Here, we explore the biological function of RPL3L (uL3L), a ribosomal protein (RP) paralog of RPL3 (uL3) that is exclusively expressed in muscle and heart tissues, by generating a viable homozygous Rpl3l knockout mouse strain. We identify a rescue mechanism in which, upon RPL3L depletion, RPL3 becomes upregulated, yielding RPL3-containing ribosomes instead of RPL3L-containing ribosomes that are typically found in cardiomyocytes. Using both ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) and a novel orthogonal approach consisting of ribosome pulldown coupled to nanopore sequencing (Nano-TRAP), we find that RPL3L neither modulates translational efficiency nor ribosome affinity towards a specific subset of transcripts. By contrast, we show that depletion of RPL3L leads to increased ribosome-mitochondria interactions in cardiomyocytes, which is accompanied by a significant increase in ATP levels, potentially as a result of mitochondrial activity fine-tuning. Our results demonstrate that the existence of tissue-specific RP paralogs does not necessarily lead to enhanced translation of specific transcripts or modulation of translational output. Instead, we reveal a complex cellular scenario in which RPL3L modulates the expression of RPL3, which in turn affects ribosomal subcellular localization and, ultimately, mitochondrial activity.",

Combining this with traditional phosphoproteomics, bioinformatics, and targeted assays, we uncovered that FGFR2b stimulated by its recycling ligand FGF10 activates mTOR-dependent signalling and ULK1 at the REs, leading to autophagy suppression and cell survival. This adds to the growing importance of RTK recycling in orchestrating cell fate and suggests a therapeutically targetable vulnerability in ligand-responsive cancer cells.

Exploiting Hydras relatively simple body plan, we developed approaches to visualize macropinocytosis over extended periods of time in living tissue, revealing constitutive engulfment across the entire body axis. Using pharmacological perturbations, we establish a role for stretch-activated channels, including Piezo, and downstream calcium influx in inhibiting this process. Finally, we show that the direct application of planar stretch leads to calcium influx and a corresponding inhibition of macropinocytosis. Together, our approaches provide a platform for the mechanistic dissection of constitutive macropinocytosis in physiological contexts and reveal a role for macropinocytosis in responding to membrane tension.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering the effects of historical and recent demographic processes responsible for the spatial patterns of genetic diversity and structure is a key objective in evolutionary and conservation biology. Using population genetic analyses, we investigated the demographic history, the contemporary genetic diversity and structure, and the occurrence of hybridization and introgression of two species of anadromous fish with contrasting life history strategies and which have undergone recent demographic declines, the allis shad (Alosa alosa) and the twaite shad (Alosa fallax). We genotyped 706 individuals from 20 rivers and 5 sites at sea in Southern Europe at thirteen microsatellite markers. Genetic structure between populations was lower for the nearly semelparous species A. alosa, which disperses greater distances compared to the iteroparous species, A. fallax. Individuals caught at sea were assigned at the river level for A. fallax and at the region level for A. alosa. Using an approximate Bayesian computation framework, we inferred that the most likely long term historical divergence scenario between both species and lineages involved historical separation followed by secondary contact accompanied by strong population size decline. Accordingly, we found evidence for contemporary hybridization and bidirectional introgression due to gene flow between both species and lineages. Moreover, our results support the existence of at least one distinct species in the Mediterrannean sea: A. agone in Golfe du Lion area, and another divergent lineage in Corsica. Overall, our results shed light on the interplay between historical and recent demographic processes and life history strategies in shaping population genetic diversity and structure of closely related species. The recent demographic decline of these species populations and their hybridization should be carefully considered while implementing conservation programs.",

    "abstract": "In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the FLO1 gene encodes flocculins that lead to formation of multicellular flocs, that offer protection to the constituent cells. Flo1p was found to preferentially bind to fellow cooperators compared to defectors lacking FLO1 expression, resulting in enrichment of cooperators within the flocs. Given this dual function in cooperation and kin recognition, FLO1 has been termed a  green beard gene. Because of the heterophilic nature of Flo1p binding however, we hypothesize that kin recognition is permissive and depends on the relative stability of FLO1+/flo1- versus FLO1+/FLO1+ bonds, which itself can be dependent on environmental conditions and intrinsic cell properties. We combine single cell measurements of adhesion strengths, individual cell-based simulations of cluster formation and evolution, and in vitro flocculation experiments to study the impact of relative bond stability on defector exclusion as well as benefit and stability of cooperation. We hereto vary the relative bond stability by changing the shear flow rate and the inherent bond strength. We identify a marked trade-off between both aspects of the green beard mechanism, with reduced relative bond stability leading to increased kin recognition, but at the expense of decreased cluster sizes and benefit of cooperation. Most notably, we show that the selection of FLO1 cooperators is negative-frequency dependent, which we directly attribute to the permissive character of the Flo1p bond. Taking into account the costs associated to FLO1 expression, this asymmetric selection results in a broad range of ecological conditions where coexistence between cooperators and defectors is stable. Although the kin recognition aspect of the FLO1  green beard gene is thus limited and condition dependent, the negative-frequency dependency of selection can conserve the diversity of flocculent and non-flocculent phenotypes ensuring flexibility towards variable selective pressures.",

    "abstract": "Transition metals are essential for a wealth of metabolic reactions, but their concentrations need to be tightly controlled across cells and cell compartments, as metal excess or imbalance has deleterious effects. Metal homeostasis is achieved by a combination of metal transport across membranes and metal binding to a variety of molecules. Gene duplication is a key process in evolution, as emergence of advantageous mutations on one of the copies can confer a new function. Here, we report that the poplar genome contains two paralogues encoding NRAMP3 metal transporters localized in tandem. All Populus species analyzed had two copies of NRAMP3, whereas only one could be identified in Salix species indicating that duplication occurred when the two genera separated. Both copies are under purifying selection and encode functional transporters, as shown by expression in the yeast heterologous expression system. However, genetic complementation revealed that only one of the paralogues has retained the original function in release of metals stored in the vacuole previously characterized in A. thaliana. Confocal imaging showed that the other copy has acquired a distinct localization to the Trans Golgi Network (TGN). Expression in poplar suggested that the copy of NRAMP3 localized on the TGN has a novel function in the control of cell-to-cell transport of manganese. This work provides a clear case of neo-functionalization through change in the subcellular localization of a metal transporter as well as evidence for the involvement of the secretory pathway in cell-to-cell transport of manganese.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAs the housekeeping genes (HKG) generally involved in maintaining essential cell functions are typically assumed to exhibit constant expression levels across cell types, they are commonly employed as internal controls in gene expression studies. Nevertheless, HKG may vary gene expression profile according to different variables introducing systematic errors into experimental results. Sex bias can indeed affect expression display, however, up to date, sex has not been typically considered as a biological variable.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we evaluate the expression profiles of six classical housekeeping genes (four metabolic: GAPDH, HPRT, PPIA, and UBC, and two ribosomal: 18S and RPL19) to determine expression stability in adipose tissues (AT) of Homo sapiens and Mus musculus and check sex bias and their overall suitability as internal controls. We also assess the expression stability of all genes included in distinct whole-transcriptome microarrays available from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to identify sex-unbiased housekeeping genes (suHKG) suitable for use as internal controls. We perform a novel computational strategy based on meta-analysis techniques to identify any sexual dimorphisms in mRNA expression stability in AT and to properly validate potential candidates.\n\nResultsJust above half of the considered studies informed properly about the sex of the human samples, however, not enough female mouse samples were found to be included in this analysis. We found differences in the HKG expression stability in humans between female and male samples, with females presenting greater instability. We propose a suHKG signature including experimentally validated classical HKG like PPIA and RPL19 and novel potential markers for human AT and discarding others like the extensively used 18S gene due to a sex-based variability display in adipose tissue. Orthologs have also been assayed and proposed for mouse WAT suHKG signature. All results generated during this study are readily available by accessing an open web resource (https://bioinfo.cipf.es/metafun-HKG) for consultation and reuse in further studies.\n\nConclusionsThis sex-based research proves that certain classical housekeeping genes fail to function adequately as controls when analyzing human adipose tissue considering sex as a variable. We confirm RPL19 and PPIA suitability as sex-unbiased human and mouse housekeeping genes derived from sex-specific expression profiles, and propose new ones such as RPS8 and UBB.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA computational strategy based on massive data analysis revealed that an accurate experimental design for adipose tissue requires the adequate selection of a sex-unbiased housekeeping genes (HKG).\nC_LIO_LIThe extensively used 18S gene displays sex-based variability in adipose tissue, although PPIA and RPL19 do not, and hence, represent robust HKG.\nC_LIO_LINew sex-unbiased human and mouse candidate HKG: RPS8 and UBB.\nC_LIO_LImetafun-HKG (https://bioinfo.cipf.es/metafun-HKG): a freely available web tool to allow users to review stable expression levels of candidate HKG along the large volume of FAIR data.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe internal promoter in L1 5UTR is critical for autonomous L1 transcription and initiating retrotransposition. Unlike the human genome, which features one contemporarily active subfamily, four subfamilies (A_I, Gf_I and Tf_I/II) have been amplifying in the mouse genome in the last one million years. Moreover, mouse L1 5UTRs are organized into tandem repeats called monomers, which are separated from ORF1 by a tether domain. In this study, we aim to compare promoter activities across young mouse L1 subfamilies and investigate the contribution of individual monomers and the tether sequence.\n\nResultsWe observed an inverse relationship between subfamily age and the average number of monomers among evolutionarily young mouse L1 subfamilies. The youngest subgroup (A_I and Tf_I/II) on average carry 3-4 monomers in the 5UTR. Using a single-vector dual-luciferase reporter assay, we compared promoter activities across six L1 subfamilies (A_I/II, Gf_I and Tf_I/II/III) and established their antisense promoter activities in a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line. Using consensus promoter sequences for three subfamilies (A_I, Gf_I and Tf_I), we dissected the differential roles of individual monomers and the tether domain in L1 promoter activity. We validated that, across multiple subfamilies, the second monomer consistently enhances the overall promoter activity. For individual promoter components, monomer 2 is consistently more active than the corresponding monomer 1 and/or the tether for each subfamily. Importantly, we revealed intricate interactions between monomer 2, monomer 1 and tether domains in a subfamily-specific manner. Furthermore, using three-monomer 5UTRs, we established a complex nonlinear relationship between the length of the outmost monomer and the overall promoter activity.\n\nConclusionsThe laboratory mouse is an important mammalian model system for human diseases as well as L1 biology. Our study extends previous findings and represents an important step toward a better understanding of the molecular mechanism controlling mouse L1 transcription as well as L1s impact on development and disease.",

    "abstract": "Proper disinfection of harvested food and water is critical to minimize infectious disease. Grape seed extract (GSE), a commonly used health supplement, is a mixture of plant-derived polyphenols. Polyphenols possess anti-microbial and -fungal properties, but anti-viral effects are not well-known. Here we show that GSE outperformed chemical disinfectants (e.g., free chlorine and peracetic acids) in inactivating Tulane virus, a human norovirus surrogate. GSE induced virus aggregation, an event that correlated with a decrease in virus titers. This aggregation and disinfection was not reversible. Molecular docking simulations indicate that polyphenols potentially formed hydrogen bonds and strong hydrophobic interactions with specific residues in viral capsid proteins. Together, these data suggest that polyphenols physically associate with viral capsid proteins to aggregate viruses as a means to inhibit virus entry into the host cell. Plant-based polyphenols like GSE are an attractive alternative to chemical disinfectants to remove infectious viruses from water or food.\n\nImportanceHuman noroviruses are major food- and water-borne pathogens, causing approximately 20% of all cases of acute gastroenteritis cases in developing and developed countries. Proper sanitation or disinfection are critical strategies to minimize human norovirus-caused disease until a reliable vaccine is created. Grape seed extract (GSE) is a mixture of plant-derived polyphenols that is used as a health supplement. Polyphenols are known for antimicrobial, antifungal, and antibiofilm activities, but antiviral effects are not well-known. In studies here, plant-derived polyphenols outperformed chemical disinfectants (e.g., free chlorine and peracetic acids) in inactivating Tulane virus, a human norovirus surrogate. Based on data from additional molecular assays and molecular docking simulations, the current model is that the polyphenols in GSE bind to the Tulane virus capsid, an event that triggers virion aggregation. It is thought that this aggregation prevents Tulane virus from entering host cells.",

    "abstract": "Iron nanoparticles used as imaging contrast agents can help differentiate between normal and diseased tissue, or track cell movement and localize pathologies. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an imaging modality that uses the magnetic properties of iron nanoparticles to provide specific, quantitative and sensitive imaging data. MPI signals depend on the size, structure and composition of the nanoparticles; MPI-tailored nanoparticles have been developed by modifying these properties. Magnetotactic bacteria produce magnetosomes which mimic synthetic nanoparticles, and thus comprise a living contrast agent in which nanoparticle formation can be modified by mutating genes. Specifically, genes that encode proteins critical to magnetosome formation and regulation, such as mamJ which helps with filament turnover. Deletion of mamJ in Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense, MSR-1 led to clustered magnetosomes instead of the typical linear chains. Here we examined the effects of this magnetosome structure and revealed improved MPI signal and resolution from clustered magnetosomes compared to linear chains. Bioluminescent MSR-1 with the mamJ deletion were injected intravenously into tumor-bearing and healthy mice and imaged using both in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and MPI. BLI revealed the location and viability of bacteria which was used to validate localization of MPI signals. BLI identified the viability of MSR-1 for 24 hours and MPI detected iron in the liver and in multiple tumors. Development of living contrast agents offers new opportunities for imaging and therapy by using multimodality imaging to track the location and viability of the therapy and the resulting biological effects.",

    "abstract": "The study of the foreign body reaction to implanted electrodes in the brain is an important area of research for the future development of neuroprostheses and experimental electrophysiology. After electrode implantation in the brain, microglial activation, reactive astrogliosis, and neuronal cell death create an environment immediately surrounding the electrode that is significantly altered from its homeostatic state. To uncover physiological changes potentially affecting device function and longevity, spatial transcriptomics was implemented in this preliminary study to identify changes in gene expression driven by electrode implantation. This RNA-sequencing technique (10x Genomics, Visium) uses spatially coded, RNA-binding oligonucleotides on a microscope slide to spatially identify each sequencing read. For these experiments, sections of rat motor cortex implanted with Michigan-style silicon electrodes were mounted on the Visium slide for processing. Each tissue section was labeled for neurons and astrocytes using immunohistochemistry to provide a spatial reference for mapping each sequencing read relative to the device tract. Results from rat motor cortex at 24 hours, 1 week, and 6 weeks post implantation showed up to 5811 differentially expressed genes between implanted and non-implanted tissue sections. Many of these genes are related to biological mechanisms previously reported in studies of the foreign body response to implanted electrodes, while others are novel to this study. These results will provide a foundation for future work to both improve and measure the effects of gene expression on the long-term stability of recordings from implanted electrodes in the brain. Ongoing work will expand on these initial observations as we gain a better understanding of the dynamic, molecular changes taking place in the brain in response to electrode implantation.",

Here we report that nutrient deprivation severely impairs pre-rRNA processing and leads to the accumulation of unprocessed rRNAs. Upon nutrient restoration, the accumulated pre-rRNAs are processed into mature rRNAs that are utilized for ribosome biogenesis. Failure to accumulate pre-rRNAs under nutrient deprivation leads to perturbed ribosome assembly during nutrient restoration and subsequent apoptosis via uL5/uL18-mediated activation of p53. Restoration of glutamine alone activates p53 by triggering uL5/uL18 translation. Induction of uL5/uL18 protein synthesis by glutamine was dependent on the translation factor eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which was in turn dependent on Raf/MEK/ERK signalling. Depriving cells of glutamine prevents the activation of p53 by rRNA synthesis inhibitors.

We investigated whether human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), which forms pathogenic aggregates that damage pancreatic islet {beta}-cells in T2DM, is involved in T2DM-associated peripheral neuropathy. In vitro, hIAPP incubation with sensory neurons reduced neurite outgrowth and increased levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Transgenic hIAPP mice that have elevated plasma hIAPP levels without hyperglycemia developed peripheral neuropathy as evidenced by pain-associated behavior and reduced intra-epidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density. Similarly, hIAPP Ob/Ob mice that have hyperglycaemia in combination with elevated plasma hIAPP levels had signs of neuropathy, although more aggravated.\n\nIn wild-type mice, intraplantar and intravenous hIAPP injections induced long-lasting allodynia and decreased IENF density. Non-aggregating murine IAPP, mutated hIAPP (Pramlintide), or hIAPP with pharmacologically inhibited aggregation did not induce these effects. T2DM patients had reduced IENF density and more hIAPP oligomers in the skin compared to non-T2DM controls. Thus, we provide evidence that hIAPP aggregation is neurotoxic and mediates peripheral neuropathy in mice. The increased abundance of hIAPP aggregates in the skin of T2DM patients supports the notion that hIAPP is a potential contributor to T2DM neuropathy in humans.\n\nGraphic abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=132 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/471098v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@323953org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15195feorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14e7311org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16488bd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Avermectins are macrocyclic lactones with anthelmintic activity. Recently, they were found to be effective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which accounts for one third of the worldwide deaths from antimicrobial resistance. However, their anti-mycobacterial mode of action remains to be elucidated. The activity of selamectin was determined against a panel of M. tuberculosis mutants. Two strains carrying mutations in DprE1, the decaprenylphosphoryl-{beta}-D-ribose oxidase involved in the synthesis of mycobacterial arabinogalactan, were more susceptible to selamectin. Biochemical assays against the Mycobacterium smegmatis DprE1 protein confirmed this finding, and docking studies predicted a binding site in a loop that included Leu275. Sequence alignment revealed variants in this position among mycobacterial species, with the size and hydrophobicity of the residue correlating with their MIC values; M. smegmatis DprE1 variants carrying these point mutations validated the docking predictions. However, the correlation was not confirmed when M. smegmatis mutant strains were constructed and MIC phenotypic assays performed. Likewise, metabolic labeling of selamectin-treated M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis cells with 14C-labeled acetate did not reveal the expected lipid profile associated with DprE1 inhibition. Together, our results confirm the in vitro interactions of selamectin and DprE1 but suggest that selamectin could be a multi-target anti-mycobacterial compound.",
