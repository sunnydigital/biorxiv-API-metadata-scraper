    "abstract": "By means of the density functional theory (DFT) framework, the longstanding problem of the polymer brush bilayers at thermal equilibrium is studied. The calculated density profiles reveal that the brushes balance compression and interpenetration when they come into contact. The equation of state of the polymer brush bilayers is obtained and it represents scaling of the pressure with molecular parameters and distance between substrates. The results of this study may shed light in our understanding of some severe Musculoskeletal diseases which degrade the synovium. The significance of this study lays on the fact that the molecular structure is investigated through fundamental physical laws. So, this study bridges between theoretical biological physics and medicine.",

    "abstract": "Theories of learning distinguish between elemental and configural stimulus processing depending on whether stimuli are processed independently or as whole configurations. Evidence for elemental processing comes from findings of summation in animals where a compound of two dissimilar stimuli is deemed to be more predictive than each stimulus alone, whereas configural processing is supported by experiments employing similar stimuli in which summation is not found. However, in humans the summation effect is robust and impervious to similarity manipulations. In three experiments in human predictive learning, we show that summation can be obliterated when partially reinforced cues are added to the summands in training and test. This lack of summation only holds when the partially reinforced cues are similar to the reinforced cues (Experiment 1) and seems to depend on participants sampling only the most salient cue in each trial (Experiments 2a and 2b) in a sequential visual search process. Instead of attributing our and others instances of lack of summation to the customary idea of configural processing, we offer a formal sub-sampling rule that might be applied to situations in which the stimuli are hard to parse from each other.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic cell (DC) fine-tunes inflammatory versus tolerogenic responses to protect from immune-pathology. However, the role of co-regulators in maintaining this balance is unexplored. NCoR1-mediated repression of DC immune-tolerance has been recently reported. Here we found that depletion of NCoR1 paralog SMRT (NCoR2) enhanced cDC1 activation and expression of IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23 while concomitantly decreasing IL-10 expression/secretion. Consequently, co-cultured CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells depicted enhanced Th1/Th17 frequency and cytotoxicity, respectively. Comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis demonstrated differential regulation of IL-10 by SMRT and NCoR1. SMRT depletion represses mTOR-STAT3-IL10 signaling in cDC1 by downregulating NR4A1. Besides, Nfkbia and Socs3 were down-regulated in Ncor2 (Smrt) knockdown cDC1, supporting increased production of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, studies in mice showed, adoptive transfer of SMRT knockdown cDC1 in OVA-DTH induced footpad inflammation led to increased Th1/Th17 and reduced tumor burden after B16 melanoma injection by enhancing oncolytic CD8+ T-cell frequency, respectively. We also depicted decreased Ncor2 expression in Rheumatoid Arthritis, a Th1/Th17 disease.",

    "abstract": "Long-term species monitoring programmes have revealed catastrophic insect population declines and disruption of biological communities that are contributing to biodiversity loss. Such discoveries have been possible because of standardised methods, such as line transects, of counting butterflies and other insects. However, line transects are not feasible in many tropical and mountainous habitats, so alternative methods must be explored. To tackle this issue, we devised time-constrained (30-min) counts and compared butterfly diversity as estimated through this method with that estimated through line transects in three tropical habitats in India (evergreen forest, dry deciduous forest and an urban woodland). We tested the efficacy of the two methods to sample species richness and abundance, as well as numbers of rare, endemic and specialist butterflies. We observed greater species richness, and more species of habitat specialists and endemics per sample in time-constrained counts in evergreen forest, but not in the other two habitats. Thus, time-constrained counts were more efficient at detecting species in the species-rich evergreen habitat. Apart from this difference, the two sampling methods captured similar levels of species richness and other measures of diversity. Our study thus shows that time-constrained counts is a suitable if not a superior alternative to line transects to conduct butterfly diversity surveys and population monitoring in complex tropical landscapes. Due to methodological flexibility and simplicity, this method may be particularly useful to study the impacts of climate change, habitat fragmentation and land use practices on butterfly conservation in populous and tech-ready tropical countries using citizen science frameworks.",

    "abstract": "The question of how cell-to-cell differences in transcription rate affect RNA count distributions is fundamental for understanding biological processes underlying transcription. We argue that answering this question requires quantitative models that are both interpretable (describing concrete biophysical phenomena) and tractable (amenable to mathematical analysis). This enables the identification of experiments which best discriminate between competing hypotheses. As a proof of principle, we introduce a simple but flexible class of models involving a stochastic transcription rate coupled to a discrete stochastic RNA transcription and splicing process, and compare and contrast two biologically plausible hypotheses about transcription rate variation. One assumes variation is due to DNA experiencing mechanical strain, while the other assumes it is due to regulator number fluctuations. Although biophysically distinct, these models are mathematically similar, and we show they are hard to distinguish without comparing whole predicted probability distributions. Our work illustrates the importance of theory-guided data collection, and introduces a general framework for constructing and solving mathematically nontrivial continuous-discrete stochastic models.\n\nSignificance StatementThe interpretation of transcriptomic observations requires detailed models of biophysical noise that can be compared and fit to experimental data. Models of intrinsic noise, describing stochasticity in molecular reactions, and extrinsic noise, describing cell-to-cell variation, are particularly common. However, integrating and solving them is challenging, and previous results are largely limited to summary statistics. We examine two mechanistically grounded stochastic models of transcriptional variation and demonstrate that (1) well-known regimes naturally emerge in limiting cases, and (2) the choice of noise model significantly affects the RNA distributions, but not the lower moments, offering a route to model identification and inference. This approach provides a simple and biophysically interpretable means to construct and unify models of transcriptional variation.",

    "abstract": "Complex febrile seizures (CFS), a subset of paediatric febrile seizures (FS), have been studied for their prognosis, epileptogenic potential and neurocognitive outcome. We evaluated their functional connectivity differences with simple febrile seizures (SFS) in children with recent-onset FS. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) datasets of 24 children with recently diagnosed FS (SFS-n=11; CFS-n=13) were analysed. Functional connectivity (FC) was estimated using time series correlation of seed region-to-whole-brain-voxels and network topology was assessed using graph theory measures. Regional connectivity differences were correlated with clinical characteristics (FDR corrected p < 0.05). CFS patients demonstrated increased FC of the bilateral middle temporal pole (MTP), and bilateral thalami when compared to SFS. Network topology study revealed increased clustering coefficient and decreased participation coefficient in basal ganglia and thalamus suggesting an inefficient-unbalanced network topology in patients with CFS. The number of seizure recurrences negatively correlated with the integration of Left Thalamus (r= -0.58) and FC measures of Left MTP to  Right Supplementary Motor and left Precentral connectivity (r=-0.53). The FC of Right MTP to Left Amygdala, Putamen, Parahippocampal, and Orbital Frontal Cortex (r=0.61) and FC of Left Thalamus to left Putamen, Pallidum, Caudate, Thalamus Hippocampus and Insula (r 0.55) showed a positive correlation to the duration of the longest seizure. The findings of the current study report altered connectivity in children with CFS proportional to the seizure recurrence and duration. Regardless of the causal/consequential nature, such observations demonstrate the imprint of these disease-defining variables of febrile seizures on the developing brain.",

    "abstract": "The precise temporal coordination of activity in the brain is thought to be fundamental for memory encoding and retrieval. Pacemaker GABAergic neurons in the medial septum (MS) provide the largest source of innervation to the hippocampus and play a major role in controlling hippocampal theta (~8 Hz) oscillations. While pharmacological inhibition of the MS is known to disrupt memory, the exact role of MS inhibitory neurons and theta frequency rhythms in hippocampal representations and memory is not fully understood. Here, we dissociate the role of theta rhythms in spatiotemporal coding and memory using an all-optical interrogation and recording approach in freely behaving mice. We propose a novel paradigm to dissociate encoding of space, time and distance in freely moving mice and apply complementary optogenetic stimulation paradigms of MS GABAergic neurons to either pace or abolish theta altogether while recording large hippocampal cell assemblies using calcium imaging conjointly. We first show that optogenetic frequency scrambling of MS GABAergic neuron activity abolished theta rhythms and modulated the activity of a subpopulation of CA1 neurons. Such stimulation led to decreased memory retrieval in both a delayed non-match to sample task, a novel place object recognition task, as well as spontaneous cue-guided linear alternation. Strikingly, scrambled stimulations were not associated with disrupted encoding of place, time, distance, or multiplexed information. Our study suggests that theta rhythms play a specific and essential role in supporting working memory retrieval and maintenance while not being necessary for hippocampal spatiotemporal codes.",

    "abstract": "Marburg virus (MARV) causes a severe hemorrhagic fever disease in primates with mortality rates in humans up to 90%. Since 2018, MARV has been identified as a priority pathogen by the WHO, needing urgent research and development of countermeasures due to the high public health risk it poses. Recently, the first case of MARV in West Africa underscored the significant outbreak potential of this virus. The potential for cross border spread as had occurred during the Ebola 2014-2016 outbreak illustrates the critical need for Marburg vaccines. To support regulatory approval of the ChAd3-Marburg vaccine that has completed Phase I trials, we show that a non-replicating chimpanzee-derived adenovirus vector with a demonstrated safety profile in humans (ChAd3) protected against a uniformly lethal challenge with Marburg-Angola. Protective immunity was achieved within 7 days of vaccination and was maintained through one year post vaccination, antigen-specific antibodies were a significant immune correlate of protection in the acute challenge model (p=0.0003), and predictive for protection with an AUC = 0.88. These results demonstrate that a single-shot ChAd3 MARV vaccine generated a protective immune response that was both rapid and durable with a significant immune correlate of protection that will support advanced clinical development.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA single-shot of non-replicating ChAd3-MARV vaccine demonstrated both rapid (within 1 week) and durable (12 months) protection against lethal Marburg virus infection in macaques.",

Diverse immune cells move from the calvaria marrow into the dura mater via recently discovered skull-meninges connections (SMCs). However, how the calvaria bone marrow is different from the other bones and whether and how it contributes to human diseases remain unknown. Using multi-omics approaches and whole mouse transparency we reveal that bone marrow cells are highly heterogeneous across the mouse body. The calvaria harbors the most distinct molecular signature with hundreds of differentially expressed genes and proteins. Acute brain injury induces skull-specific alterations including increased calvaria cell numbers. Moreover, TSPO-positron-emission-tomography imaging of stroke, multiple sclerosis and neurodegenerative disease patients demonstrate disease-associated uptake patterns in the human skull, mirroring the underlying brain inflammation.

As initiation is the rate-limiting step of translation, we carried out an RNAi screen for key translation initiation factors required to maintain embryonic stem cell (ESC) identity. We identified eIF4A2 and defined its mechanistic action through Rps26-independent and -dependent ribosomes in translation initiation activation of mRNAs encoding pluripotency factors and the histone variant H3.3 with demonstrated roles in maintaining stem cell pluripotency. eIF4A2 also mediates translation initiation activation of Ddx6, which acts together with eIF4A2 to restrict the totipotent 2-cell transcription program in ESCs through Zscan4 mRNA degradation and translation repression. Accordingly, knockdown of eIF4A2 disrupts ESC proteome causing the loss of ESC identity. Collectively, we establish a translational paradigm of the protein synthesis of pluripotency transcription factors and epigenetic regulators imposed on their established roles in controlling pluripotency.",

    "abstract": "Gene flow between populations adapting to differing local environmental conditions might be costly because individuals can disperse to habitats where their survival is low or because they can reproduce with locally maladapted individuals. The amount by which the mean relative population fitness is kept below one creates an opportunity for modifiers of the genetic architecture to spread due to selection. Prior work that separately considered modifiers changing dispersal, recombination rates, or altering dominance or epistasis, has typically focused on the direction of selection rather than its absolute magnitude. We here develop methods to determine the strength of selection on modifiers of the genetic architecture, including modifiers of the dispersal rate, in populations that have previously evolved local adaptation. We consider scenarios with up to five loci contributing to local adaptation and derive a new model for the deterministic spread of modifiers. We find that selection for modifiers of epistasis and dominance is stronger than selection for decreased recombination, and that selection for partial reductions in recombination are extremely weak, regardless of the number of loci contributing to local adaptation. The spread of modifiers that reduce dispersal depends on the number of loci, epistasis and extent of local adaptation in the ancestral population. We identify a novel effect, that modifiers of dominance are more strongly selected when they are unlinked to the locus that they modify. These findings help explain population differentiation and reproductive isolation and provide a benchmark to compare selection on modifiers under finite population sizes and demographic stochasticity.\n\nAuthor SummaryWhen populations of a species are spread over different habitats the populations can adapt to their local conditions, provided dispersal between habitats is low enough. Natural selection allows the populations to maintain local adaptation, but dispersal and gene flow create a cost called the migration load. The migration load measures how much fitness is lost because of dispersal between different habitats, and also creates an opportunity for selection to act on the arrangement and interaction between genes that are involved in local adaptation. Modifier genes can spread in these linked populations and cause functional, local adaptation genes, to become more closely linked on a chromosome, or change the way that these genes are expressed so that the locally adapted gene copy becomes dominant. We modeled this process and found that selection on modifiers that create tighter linkage between locally adapted genes is generally weak, and modifiers that cause gene interactions are more strongly selected. Even after these gene interactions have begun to evolve, further selection for increased gene interaction is still strong. Our results show that populations are more likely to adapt to local conditions by evolving new gene interactions than by evolving tightly linked gene clusters.",

    "abstract": "Among the main features treasured by blueberry consumers, flavor is the most important. Human perception of food flavors can primarily be divided into two main sensory inputs, taste and aroma. Through retronasal olfaction, a group of metabolites called volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from the fruit are able to produce the sensation of aroma, creating the myriad of flavors experienced during our life. In blueberry, breeders have noticed some genotypes with unique floral and sweet flavor notes that, ultimately, enhance human aroma perception. Despite the importance, both the understanding of which chemicals are mediating this variation across phenotypes and the potential impact on consumer preferences remains largely unknown. In this study we dissected the main components underlying blueberry aroma and associated it with consumer predilections by paring metabolomics with sensory analysis. Our contribution in this study is four-fold: (i) first, based on a representative blueberry germplasm cultivated at the University of Florida, we differentiated genotypes with floral and sweet aromatic notes and confirmed that such unique characteristics are preferred by consumers; (ii) at the chemical level, we showed that a group of eight terpene volatiles constitute the primary metabolic group associated with aroma sensation; (iii) we demonstrated that aromatic genotypes can be classified using information from a group of a few key volatiles; and finally, (iv) we combined pedigree and metabolomic information in a single predictive framework and showed the importance of metabolomic data for flavor-assisted selection. For the blueberry community, our findings open new venues to explore flavor. Broadly, we present an emerging view about flavor and provide a detailed blueprint of how this target could be addressed in fruits and vegetables.",

    "abstract": "Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are a cornerstone of modern molecular detection, but the technique still suffers some notable challenges. One of the biggest problems is discriminating true signal generated by target molecules versus non-specific background arising from the interaction of detection antibodies with the assay substrate or interferents in the sample matrix. Single-Molecule Colocalization Assay (SiMCA) overcomes this problem by employing total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to quantify target proteins based on the colocalization of fluorescent signal from orthogonally labeled capture and detection antibodies. By specifically counting colocalized fluorescent signals, we can essentially eliminate the confounding effects of background produced by non-specific binding of detection antibodies. We further employed a normalization strategy to account for the heterogeneous distribution of the capture antibodies, greatly improving the reproducibility of our measurements. In a series of experiments with TNF-, we show that SiMCA can achieve a three-fold lower limit of detection compared to conventional single-color assays using the same antibodies and exhibits consistent performance for assays performed in complex specimens such as chicken serum and human blood. Our results help define the pernicious effects of non-specific background in immunoassays and demonstrate the diagnostic gains that can be achieved by eliminating those effects.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance hypothesis posits that an imbalance between excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) mechanisms underlies the behavioral characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (autism). However, how E/I imbalance arises and how it may differ across autism symptomatology and brain regions is not well understood.\n\nMethodsWe used innovative analysis methods - combining competitive gene-set analysis and gene-expression profiles in relation to cortical thickness (CT)- to investigate the relationship between genetic variance, brain structure and autism symptomatology of participants from the EU-AIMS LEAP cohort (autism=360, male/female=259/101; neurotypical control participants=279, male/female=178/101) aged 6 to 30 years. Competitive gene-set analysis investigated associations between glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling pathway gene-sets and clinical measures, and CT. Additionally, we investigated expression profiles of the genes within those sets throughout the brain and how those profiles relate to differences in CT between autistic and neurotypical control participants in the same regions.\n\nResultsThe glutamate gene-set was associated with all autism symptom severity scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) within the autistic group, while the GABA set was associated with sensory processing measures (using the SSP subscales) across all participants. Brain regions with greater gene expression of both glutamate and GABA genes showed greater differences in CT between autistic and neurotypical control participants.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest crucial roles for glutamate and GABA genes in autism symptomatology as well as CT, where GABA is more strongly associated with sensory processing and glutamate more with autism symptom severity.",

    "abstract": "The neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh) plays an important role in arousal, attention, vigilance, learning and memory. ACh is released during different behavioural states and affects the brain microcircuit by regulating neuronal and synaptic properties. Here, we investigated how a low concentration of ACh (30 {micro}M) affects the intrinsic properties of electrophysiologically and morphologically identified excitatory and inhibitory neurons in layer 4 (L4) of rat barrel cortex. ACh altered the membrane potential of L4 neurons in a heterogeneous manner. Nearly all L4 regular spiking (RS) neurons responded to bath-application of ACh with a M4 muscarinic ACh receptor-mediated hyperpolarisation. In contrast, in the majority of L4 fast spiking (FS) and non-fast spiking (nFS) interneurons 30 {micro}M ACh induced a depolarisation while the remainder showed a hyperpolarisation or no response. The ACh-induced depolarisation of L4 FS interneurons was much weaker than that in L4 nFS interneurons. There was no clear difference in the response to ACh for three morphological subtypes of L4 FS interneurons. However, in four morpho-electrophysiological subtypes of L4 nFS interneurons, VIP+-like interneurons showed the strongest ACh-induced depolarisation; occasionally, even action potential (AP) firing was elicited. The ACh-induced depolarisation in L4 FS interneurons was exclusively mediated by M1 muscarinic ACh receptors; in L4 nFS interneurons it was mainly mediated by M1 and/or M3/5 muscarinic ACh receptors. In a subset of L4 nFS interneurons, a co-operative activation of nicotinic ACh receptors was also observed. The present study demonstrates that low-concentrations of ACh affect the different L4 neurons types in a cell-type specific way. These effects result from a specific expression of different muscarinic and/or nicotinic ACh receptors on the somatodendritic compartments of L4 neurons. This suggests that even at low concentrations ACh may tune the excitability of L4 excitatory and inhibitory neurons and their synaptic microcircuits differentially depending on the behavioural state during which ACh is released.",

Here, using high-dimensional single-cell profiling we examined whether T cell states in the blood circulation could predict responsiveness to a combined ICT, sequentially targeting OX40 costimulatory and PD-1 inhibitory pathways, which effectively eradicated syngeneic mouse tumors. Unbiased assessment of transcriptomic alterations by single-cell RNA sequencing and profiling of cell-surface protein expression by mass cytometry revealed unique activation states for therapy-responsive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Effective ICT elicited T cells with dynamic expression of distinct NK cell and chemokine receptors, and these cells were systemically present in lymphoid tissues and in the tumor. Moreover, NK cell receptor-expressing CD8+ T cells were also present in the peripheral blood of immunotherapy-responsive cancer patients. Targeting of the NK cell and chemokine receptors in tumor-bearing mice showed their functional importance for therapy-induced anti-tumor immunity. These findings provide a better understanding of ICT and highlight the use of dynamic biomarkers on effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to improve cancer immunotherapy.",

Therefore, it is meaningful to study the function of the genes related to pollen development and male sterility, which is still not fully understand currently. Here, we conducted comparative analyses to screen fertility related genes using RNA-seq, iTRAQ, and PRM-based assay. A gene encoding expansin protein in wheat, TaEXPB5, was isolated in KTM3315A, which was in the cell wall and preferentially upregulated expression in the fertility anthers. The silencing of TaEXPB5 displayed pollen abortion, the declination or sterility of fertility. Further, cytological investigation indicated that the silencing of TaEXPB5 induced the early degradation of tapetum and abnormal development of pollen wall. These results revealed that the silencing of TaEXPB5 could eliminate the effects of temperature on male fertility, and resulting in functional loss of fertility conversion, which implied that TaEXPB5 may be essential for anther or pollen development and male fertility of KTM3315A. These findings provide a novel insight into molecular mechanism of fertility conversion for thermo-sensitive cytoplasmic male-sterility wheat, and contribute to the molecular breeding of hybrid wheat in the future.\n\nHighlightTaEXPB5 coffers to anther or pollen development and male fertility in KTM3315A, its silencing could eliminate the effects of temperature on male fertility, and resulting in functional loss of fertility conversion.",

    "abstract": "Fused in sarcoma (FUS) undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form granules in cells, leading to pathogenic aggregations that cause neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Proteomics analysis revealed that FUS granules contain valosin-containing protein (VCP), a member of the AAA family ATPase. Confocal microscopy images showed that VCP co-localized in the FUS granules in cells. This study demonstrates that VCP in granules has a two-faced role in FUS granulation: VCP stabilizes de novo FUS granules, while VCP present in the granules for extended periods dissolves them. This VCP function relies on its ATPase activity to consume ATP in granules. VCP stabilizes de novo FUS by reducing intragranular ATP concentrations to a range below the cytosolic concentration. VCP continually consumes ATP during its stay in the granules, which eventually lowers ATP concentrations to a range that destabilizes the granules. VCP, therefore, acts as a timer to limit the residence of FUS granules in cells and thereby prohibits the FUS fibrillization that occurs in persistent granules. VCP ATPase activity plays a role in FUS granule turnover.\n\nSummary statementVCP recruited to FUS granules regulates the stability of the granules in a time-dependent manner by consuming intragranular ATP with its ATPase activity.",

    "abstract": "Experiments with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are limited by the need for biosafety level 3 (BSL3) conditions. A SARS-CoV-2 replicon system rather than an in vitro infection system is suitable for antiviral screening since it can be handled under BSL2 conditions and does not produce infectious particles. However, the reported replicon systems are cumbersome because of the need for transient transfection in each assay. In this study, we constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome vector (the replicon-BAC vector) including the SARS-CoV-2 replicon and a fusion gene encoding Renilla luciferase and neomycin phosphotransferase II, examined the antiviral effects of several known compounds, and then established a cell line stably harboring the replicon-BAC vector. Several cell lines transiently transfected with the replicon-BAC vector produced subgenomic replicon RNAs (sgRNAs) and viral proteins, and exhibited luciferase activity. In the transient replicon system, treatment with remdesivir or interferon-{beta} but not with camostat or favipiravir suppressed the production of viral agents and luciferase, indicating that luciferase activity corresponds to viral replication. VeroE6/Rep3, a stable replicon cell line based on VeroE6 cells, was successfully established and continuously produced viral proteins, sgRNAs and luciferase, and their production was suppressed by treatment with remdesivir or interferon-{beta}. Molnupiravir, a novel coronavirus RdRp inhibitor, inhibited viral replication more potently in VeroE6/Rep3 cells than in VeroE6-based transient replicon cells. In summary, our stable replicon system will be a powerful tool for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals through high-throughput screening.",

    "abstract": "Dimension reduction and (spatial) clustering is usually performed sequentially; however, the low-dimensional embeddings estimated in the dimension-reduction step may not be relevant to the class labels inferred in the clustering step. We therefore developed a computation method, Dimension-Reduction Spatial-Clustering (DR-SC), that can simultaneously perform dimension reduction and (spatial) clustering within a unified framework. Joint analysis by DR-SC produces accurate (spatial) clustering results and ensures the effective extraction of biologically informative low-dimensional features. DR-SC is applicable to spatial clustering in spatial transcriptomics that characterizes the spatial organization of the tissue by segregating it into multiple tissue structures. Here, DR-SC relies on a latent hidden Markov random field model to encourage the spatial smoothness of the detected spatial cluster boundaries. Underlying DR-SC is an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm based on an iterative conditional mode. As such, DR-SC is scalable to large sample sizes and can optimize the spatial smoothness parameter in a data-driven manner. With comprehensive simulations and real data applications, we show that DR-SC outperforms existing clustering and spatial clustering methods: it extracts more biologically relevant features than conventional dimension reduction methods, improves clustering performance, and offers improved trajectory inference and visualization for downstream trajectory inference analyses.",

    "abstract": "Neuromuscular magnetic stimulation is a promising tool in neurorehabilitation due to its deeper penetration, notably lower distress, and respectable force levels compared to electrical stimulation. However, this method faces great challenges from a technological perspective. The systematic design of better equipment and the incorporation into modern training setups requires better understanding of the mechanisms and predictive quantitative models of the recruited forces. This article proposes a model for simulating the force recruitment in isometric muscle stimulation of the thigh extensors based on previous theoretical and experimental findings. The model couples a 3D field model for the physics with a parametric recruitment model, which is identified with a mixed-effects design to learn the most likely model based on available experimental data with a wide range of field conditions. This approach intentionally keeps the model as mathematically simple and statistically parsimonious as possible in order to avoid over-fitting. The coupled model is able to accurately predict key phenomena observed so far, such as a threshold shift for different distances between coil and body, the different recruiting performance of various coils with available measurement data in the literature, and the saturation behaviour with its onset amplitude. The presented recruitment model could also be readily incorporated into dynamic models for biomechanics as soon as sufficient experimental data are available for calibration.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal differentiation is a complex process that entails extensive morphological, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes that dictate neuronal lineage commitment. Much less understood is the role that epigenetic and epi-transcriptional reprogramming plays in the process of neuronal differentiation and maturation. To depict the whole landscape of transcriptomics and epigenetic changes during neuronal differentiation and maturation, we differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and performed RNA sequencing on differentiated and undifferentiated cells. 728 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) enriched in synaptic signaling and cell morphogenesis pathways were observed. Moreover, transcriptome-wide mRNA stability profiling revealed that genes with altered stability were exceptionally enriched for redox homeostasis pathways. Mature neurons are known to be highly sensitive to oxidative stress, which is crucial in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disease. Our results suggest that this heightened sensitivity is regulated at the mRNA stability level (i.e., epigenetic) rather than at the transcriptional level. Alternative splicing analysis revealed the exon skipping and alternative mRNA isoforms enriched for morphogenesis related pathway. Alternatively, alternative 5 and 3 prime splicing site, intron retention and mutually exclusive exon events exclusively clustered in the translation and translation initiation pathways, suggesting the potential effect of alternative splicing on translation following neuronal maturation. Splice motif analysis revealed enriched motifs for RBPs that regulate various splice types and can be further correlated to distinct phenotypical changes during neuronal differentiation and maturation. Here we present an extensive exploration of the transcriptional and epigenetic changes and their potential association with the process of neuronal differentiation, providing a new insight into understanding the molecular mechanism of neuronal function and behavior.",

    "abstract": "Multiple mutations have been seen to undergo convergent evolution in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. One such evolution occurs in Beta, Gamma, and Omicron variants at three amino acid positions K417, E484, and N501 in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. We examined the physical mechanisms underlying the convergent evolution of three mutations K417T/E484K/N501Y by delineating the individual and collective effects of mutations on binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor, immune escape from neutralizing antibodies, protein stability and expression. Our results show that each mutation serves a distinct function that improves virus fitness supporting its positive selection, even though individual mutations have deleterious effects that make them prone to negative selection. Compared to the wild-type, K417T escapes Class 1 antibodies, has increased stability and expression; however, it has decreased receptor binding. E484K escapes Class 2 antibodies; however, it has decreased receptor binding, stability and expression. N501Y increases receptor binding; however, has decreased stability and expression. When these mutations come together, the deleterious effects are mitigated due to the presence of compensatory effects. Triple mutant K417T/E484K/N501Y has increased receptor binding, escapes both Class 1 and Class 2 antibodies, and has similar stability and expression as that of the wild-type. These results show the implications of presence of multiple mutations on virus evolution that enhance viral fitness on different fronts by balancing both positive and negative selection and improves the chances of selection of mutations together.",

Here we find a markedly increased frequency of CD8+ T cells expressing inhibitory Killer cell Immunoglobulin like Receptors (KIR), the human equivalent of the Ly49 family, in the blood and inflamed tissues of various autoimmune diseases. Moreover, KIR+CD8+ T cells can efficiently eliminate pathogenic gliadin-specific CD4+ T cells from Celiac disease (CeD) patients leukocytes in vitro. Furthermore, we observe elevated levels of KIR+CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ regulatory T cells, in COVID-19 and influenza-infected patients, and this correlates with disease severity and vasculitis in COVID-19. Expanded KIR+CD8+ T cells from these different diseases display shared phenotypes and similar T cell receptor sequences. These results characterize a regulatory CD8+ T cell subset in humans, broadly active in both autoimmune and infectious diseases, which we hypothesize functions to control self-reactive or otherwise pathogenic T cells.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryHere we identified KIR+CD8+ T cells as a regulatory CD8+ T cell subset in humans that suppresses self-reactive or otherwise pathogenic CD4+ T cells.",

    "abstract": "The secreted enzyme interleukin four-induced gene 1 (IL4I1) is involved in the negative control of the adaptive immune response. IL4I1 expression in human cancer is frequent and correlates with poor survival and resistance to immunotherapy. Nevertheless, its mechanism of action remains partially unknown. Here, we identified transmembrane serine protease 13 (TMPRSS13) as an immune cell-expressed surface protein that binds IL4I1. TMPRSS13 is a paralog of TMPRSS2, whose protease activity participates in the cleavage of SARS-Cov2 Spike protein and facilitates virus induced-membrane fusion. We show that TMPRSS13 is expressed by human lymphocytes, monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages, can cleave the Spike protein and allow Sars-Cov2 Spike pseudotyped virus entry into cells. We identify regions of homology between IL4I1 and Spike and demonstrate competition between the two proteins for TMPRSS13 binding. These findings may be relevant for both interfering with SARS-Cov2 infection and limiting IL4I1-dependent immunosuppressive activity in cancer.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryThrough binding to its newly identified receptor TMPRSS13, the enzyme IL4I1 interferes with SARS-Cov2 Spike cleavage thereby blocking viral entry into host cells.",

    "abstract": "The wide transmission and host adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 have led to the rapid accumulation of mutations, posing significant challenges to the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. Although several neutralizing antibodies were authorized for emergency clinical use, convalescent patients derived natural antibodies are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutation. Here, we describe the screen of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) targeted nanobodies (Nbs) from a synthetic library and the design of a biparatopic Nb, named Nb1-Nb2, with tight affinity and super wide neutralization breadth against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Deep-mutational scanning experiments identify the potential binding epitopes of the Nbs on the RBD and demonstrate that biparatopic Nb1-Nb2 has a strong escape resistant feature against more than 60 tested RBD amino acid substitutions. Using pseudovirion-based and trans-complementation SARS-CoV-2 tools, we determine that the Nb1-Nb2 broadly neutralizes multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), Lambda (C.37), Kappa (B.1.617.1) and Mu (B.1.621). Furthermore, a heavy chain antibody is constructed by fusing the human IgG1 Fc to Nb1-Nb2 (designated as Nb1-Nb2-Fc) to improve its neutralization potency, yield, stability and potential half-life extension. For the new Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) that harbors unprecedented multiple RBD mutations, Nb1-Nb2-Fc keeps a firm affinity (KD < 1.0x10-12 M) and strong neutralizing activity (IC50 = 0.0017 nM). Together, we developed a tetravalent biparatopic human heavy chain antibody with ultrapotent and broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity which highlights the potential clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "O-GlcNAcylation is a reversible post-translational modification involved the regulation of cytosolic, nuclear and mitochondrial proteins. Only two enzymes, OGT and OGA, control attachment and removal of O-GlcNAc on proteins, respectively. Whereas a variant OGT (mOGT) has been proposed as the main isoform that O-GlcNAcylates proteins in mitochondria, identification of a mitochondrial OGA has not been performed yet. Two splice variants of OGA (short and long isoforms) have been described previously. In this work, using cell fractionation experiments, we show that short-OGA is preferentially recovered in mitochondria-enriched fractions from HEK-293T cells as well as mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Moreover, fluorescent microscopy imaging confirmed that GFP-tagged short-OGA is addressed to mitochondria. In addition, using a BRET-based mitochondrial O-GlcNAcylation biosensor, we show that co-transfection of short-OGA markedly reduced O-GlcNAcylation of the biosensor, whereas long-OGA had no significant effect. Finally, using genetically encoded or chemical fluorescent mitochondrial probes, we showed that short-OGA overexpression increases mitochondrial ROS levels, whereas long-OGA had no significant effect. Together, our work reveals that the short-OGA isoform is targeted to the mitochondria where it regulates ROS homoeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Prevalent single cell transcriptomic profiling (scRNA-seq) mechods are mainly based on synthesis and enrichment of full-length double-stranded complementary DNA. These approaches are challenging to generate accurate quantification of transcripts when their abundance is low or their full-length amplifications are difficult. Based on our previous finding that Tn5 transposase can directly cut-and-tag DNA/RNA hetero-duplexes, we present SHERRY2, a specifically optimized protocol for scRNA-seq without second strand cDNA synthesis. SHERRY2 is free of pre-amplification and eliminates the sequence-dependent bias. In comparison with other widely-used scRNA-seq methods, SHERRY2 exhibits significantly higher sensitivity and accuracy even for single nuclei. Besides, SHERRY2 is simple and robust, and can be easily scaled up to high-throughput experiments. When testing single lymphocytes and neuron nuclei, SHERRY2 not only obtained accurate countings of transcription factors and long non-coding RNAs, but also provided bias-free results that enriched genes in specific cellular components or functions, which outperformed other protocols. With a few thousand cells sequenced by SHERRY2, we confirmed expression and dynamics of Myc in different cell types of germinal centers, which were previously only revealed by gene-specific amplification methods. SHERRY2 is able to provide high sensitivity, high accuracy, and high throughput for those applications that require high number of genes identified in each cell. It can reveal the subtle transcriptomic difference between cells and facilitate important biological discoveries.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorylated within its Ser/Arg-rich region, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N) recruits the phosphopeptide-binding human 14-3-3 proteins that play a well-recognized role in replication of many viruses. Here we use genetic code expansion to demonstrate that phosphorylation of SARS-CoV-2 N at either of two pseudo-repeats centered at Ser197 and Thr205 is sufficient for 14-3-3 binding. According to fluorescence anisotropy, the pT205-motif, present in SARS-CoV-2 but not in SARS-CoV, is preferred over the pS197-motif by all seven human 14-3-3 isoforms, which display unforeseen pT205/pS197 binding selectivity hierarchy. Crystal structures demonstrate that pS197 and pT205 are mutually exclusive 14-3-3-binding sites, whereas SAXS and biochemical data indicate 14-3-3 binding occludes the Ser/Arg-rich region, inhibiting its dephosphorylation. This Ser/Arg-rich region of N is highly prone to mutations, as exemplified by the Omicron and Delta variants, with our data suggesting how the strength of its 14-3-3 binding can be linked with the replicative fitness of the virus.",

    "abstract": "Emerging SARS CoV-2 variants are creating major challenges in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Predicting CoV-2 mutations that increase transmissibility or immune evasion would be extremely valuable in development of broad-acting therapeutics and vaccines and prioritising viral monitoring and containment. Using in vitro evolution, we identify a double mutation in CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) that increases affinity for ACE2 almost 20-fold. We determine the mutant:ACE2 structure to reveal the binding mechanism and show the main affinity driver, Q498H, boosts binding of other RBD variants. We find this mutation incompatible with the common N501Y mutation, but N501Y variants can acquire Q498R to access a similar bonding network and affinity gain. We show Q498H, and Q498R plus N501Y, enable variants to bind rat ACE2 with high affinity. These mutations are now emerging in CoV-2 variants, such as the Omicron variant, where they would be expected to drive increased human-to-human and cross-species transmission.",

    "abstract": "The newly identified Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Voronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has steered concerns across the world due to the possession of large number of mutations leading to high infectivity and vaccine escape potential. The Omicron variant houses 32 mutations in S protein alone. The viral infectivity is determined mainly by the ability of spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) to bind to the human Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. In this paper, the interaction of the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 variants with hACE2 was analyzed by using protein-protein docking and compared with the novel Omicron variant. Our findings reveal that the Omicron RBD interacts strongly with hACE2 receptor via unique amino acid residues as compared to the Wuhan and many other variants. However, the interacting residues of RBD are found to be the same in Lamda (C.37) variant. These unique binding of Omicron RBD with hACE2 suggests an increased potential of infectivity and vaccine evasion potential of the new variant. The evolutionary drive of the SARS-CoV-2 may not be exclusively driven by RBD variants but surely provides for the platform for emergence of new variants.",

In this study, an auditory change-detection task with task-irrelevant rewards was introduced. The participants were informed explicitly in advance that the rewards would be given randomly. The results revealed that while inhibition related to reward priming only occurred when the participants were explicitly informed about rewards, implicit instruction thereof resulted in enhancement and inhibition associated with reward priming.
