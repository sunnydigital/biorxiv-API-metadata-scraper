    "abstract": "Hundreds of hydrophobic substances: alkanes, alcohols, benzodiacepines, barbiturates, ethers and even gases, can induce General Anaesthesia (GA) in mammal animals. Moreover, it has been suggested that the primary site of action of such agents is on the spinal cord. Here, we investigate a scenario that is in double measure important to understand the mechanisms behind GA: its induction under water in invertebrate animals. We evaluate the capacity of xenon, nitrous oxide and krypton to suppress harmful sensations, provoked by intense light, in the crustacean D. magna. Due to the hydrophobic characteristics of those gases, we designed a special chamber to force them to dissolve in water at pressures up to to 50 atmospheres, whereas at the same time measure in real time the motility of the animals. Surprisingly, the aquatic animals are immobilized with xenon and nitrous oxide. Under this condition, they dont respond to a noxious stimulus. Our results are crucial to understand the action of inert gases in GA and the role of the spinal cord.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous neuronal activity is a hallmark of the developing brain. In rodents, a handful of such activities were described in different cortical areas but the unifying macroscopic perspective is still lacking. Here we combined large-scale in vivo Ca2+ imaging of the dorsal cortex in non-anesthetized neonatal mice with advanced mathematical analyses to reveal unique behavioral state-specific maps of endogenous activity. These maps were remarkably stable over time within and across experiments and used patches of correlated activity with little hemispheric symmetry as well as stationary and propagating waves as building blocks. Importantly, the maps recorded during motion and rest were almost inverse, with sensory-motor areas active during motion and posterior-lateral areas active at rest. The retrosplenial cortex engaged in both resting- and motion-related activities, building functional long-range connections with respective cortical areas. The data obtained bind different region-specific activity patterns described so far into a single consistent picture and set the stage for future inactivation studies, probing the exact function of this complex activity pattern for cortical wiring in neonates.",

    "abstract": "Multidrug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli strains that carry extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamases (ESBLs) or colistin resistance gene mcr-1 have been identified in the human gut at an increasing incidence worldwide. In this study, we sampled and characterized MDR Enterobacteriaceae from the gut microbiota of healthy Singaporeans and show that the prevalence of ESBL-producing and mcr-positive Enterobacteriaceae is 26.6% and 7.3%, respectively. Whole-genome sequencing of 37 E. coli isolates identified 25 sequence types and assigned them into six different phylogroups, suggesting that the human intestinal MDR E. coli strains are highly diverse. In addition, we found that E. coli isolates belonging to phylogroup D, B2 and F carry a higher number of virulence genes, whereas isolates of phylogroup A, B1 and E carry fewer virulence factor genes but are frequent carriers of florfenicol resistance gene floR and colistin resistance gene mcr-1. Comparison of the seven mcr-1-positive E. coli isolates revealed that mcr-1 is carried by conjugative plasmids or embedded in composite transposons, which could potentially mobilize mcr-1 to other pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae strains or MDR plasmids. Finally, we found that 12 out of the 37 MDR E. coli isolates in this study show high similarity to ESBL-producing E. coli isolates from raw meats from local markets, suggesting a potential transmission of MDR E. coli from meat products to the human gut microbiota. Our findings show diverse antibiotic resistance and virulence profiles of intestinal E. coli and call for better countermeasures to block the transmission of MDR E. coli via the food chain.\n\nImportanceThe human gut can harbor both antibiotic resistant and virulent E. coli which may subsequently cause infections. In this study, the antibiotic resistance and virulence traits of antibiotic-resistant E. coli isolates from human gut microbiota of healthy subjects were investigated. The isolated E. coli strains carry a diverse range of antibiotic resistance mechanisms and virulence factor genes, are highly diverse to each other, and are likely to originate from raw meat products from the local markets. Of particular concern are seven E. coli isolates which carry colistin resistance gene mcr-1. This gene can be mobilized into other pathogens and MDR plasmids, thereby spreading resistance to the last-resort antibiotic colistin. Our findings also suggest that raw meat could serve as important source to transmit MDR bacteria into the human gut microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Dispersal is a key process mediating ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Its effects on metapopulations dynamics, population genetics or species range distribution can depend on phenotypic differences between dispersing and non-dispersing individuals (i.e., dispersal syndromes). However, scaling up to the importance of dispersal syndromes for meta-ecosystems have rarely been considered, despite intraspecific phenotypic variability is now recognised as an important factor mediating ecosystem functioning. In this study, we characterised the intraspecific variability of dispersal syndromes in twenty isolated genotypes of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila to test their consequences for biomass productivity in communities composed of five Tetrahymena species. To do so, dispersers and residents of each genotype were introduced, each separately, in ciliate communities composed of four other competing species of the genus Tetrahymena to investigate the effects of dispersal syndromes. We found that introducing dispersers led to a lower biomass compared to introducing residents. This effect was highly consistent across the twenty T. thermophila genotypes despite their marked differences of dispersal syndromes. Finally, we found a strong genotypic effect on biomass production, confirming that intraspecific variability in general affected ecosystem functions in our system. Our study shows that intraspecific variability and the existence of dispersal syndromes can impact the functioning of spatially structured ecosystems in a consistent and therefore predictable way.",

    "abstract": "Plant breeding is a decision making discipline based on understanding project objectives. Genetic improvement projects can have two competing objectives: maximize rate of genetic improvement and minimize loss of useful genetic variance. For commercial plant breeders competition in the marketplace forces greater emphasis on maximizing immediate genetic improvements. In contrast public plant breeders have an opportunity, perhaps an obligation, to place greater emphasis on minimizing loss of useful genetic variance while realizing genetic improvements. Considerable research indicates that short term genetic gains from Genomic Selection (GS) are much greater than Phenotypic Selection (PS), while PS provides better long term genetic gains because PS retains useful genetic diversity during the early cycles of selection. With limited resources must a soybean breeder choose between the two extreme responses provided by GS or PS? Or is it possible to develop novel breeding strategies that will provide a desirable compromise between the competing objectives? To address these questions, we decomposed breeding strategies into decisions about selection methods, mating designs and whether the breeding population should be organized as family islands. For breeding populations organized into islands decisions about possible migration rules among family islands were included. From among 60 possible strategies, genetic improvement is maximized for the first five to ten cycles using GS, a hub network mating design in breeding populations organized as fully connected family islands and migration rules allowing exchange of two lines among islands every other cycle of selection. If the objectives are to maximize both short-term and long-term gains, then the best compromise strategy is similar except a genomic mating design, instead of a hub networked mating design, is used. This strategy also resulted in realizing the greatest proportion of genetic potential of the founder populations. Weighted genomic selection applied to both non-isolated and island populations also resulted in realization of the greatest proportion of genetic potential of the founders, but required more cycles than the best compromise strategy.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 emerged in late 2019 and resulted in a devastating pandemic. Although the first approved vaccines were already administered by the end of 2020, worldwide vaccine availability is still limited. Moreover, immune escape variants of the virus are emerging against which the current vaccines may confer only limited protection. Further, existing antivirals and treatment options against COVID-19 only show limited efficacy. Influenza A virus (IAV) defective interfering particles (DIPs) were previously proposed not only for antiviral treatment of the influenza disease but also for pan-specific treatment of interferon (IFN)-sensitive respiratory virus infections. To investigate the applicability of IAV DIPs as an antiviral for the treatment of COVID-19, we conducted in vitro co-infection experiments with cell culture-derived DIPs and the IFN-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 in human lung cells. We show that treatment with IAV DIPs leads to complete abrogation of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Moreover, this inhibitory effect was dependent on janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling. Further, our results suggest boosting of IFN-induced antiviral activity by IAV DIPs as a major contributor in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Thus, we propose IAV DIPs as an effective antiviral agent for treatment of COVID-19, and potentially also for suppressing the replication of new variants of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Since the first case of COVID-19 in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 has spread worldwide and within a year has caused 2.29 million deaths globally. With dramatically increasing infection numbers, and the arrival of new variants with increased infectivity, tracking the evolution of its genome is crucial for effectively controlling the pandemic and informing vaccine platform development. Our study explores evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a representative cohort of sequences covering the entire genome in the United States, through all of 2020 and early 2021. Strikingly, we detected many accumulating Single Nucleotide Variations (SNVs) encoding amino acid changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, with a pattern indicative of RNA editing enzymes as major mutators of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We report three major variants through October of 2020. These revealed 14 key mutations that were found in various combinations among 14 distinct predominant signatures. These signatures likely represent evolutionary lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. and reveal clues to its evolution such as a mutational burst in the summer of 2020 likely leading to a homegrown new variant, and a trend towards higher mutational load among viral isolates, but with occasional mutation loss. The last quartile of 2020 revealed a concerning accumulation of mostly novel low frequency replacement mutations in the Spike protein, and a hypermutable glutamine residue near the putative furin cleavage site. Finally, the end of the year data revealed the presence of known variants of concern including B.1.1.7, which has acquired additional Spike mutations. Overall, our results suggest that predominant viral sequences are dynamically evolving over time, with periods of mutational bursts and unabated mutation accumulation. This high level of existing variation, even at low frequencies and especially in the Spike-encoding region may be become problematic when superspreader events, akin to serial Founder Events in evolution, drive these rare mutations to prominence.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused the death of more than 2.29 million people and continues to be a severe threat internationally. Although simple measures such as social distancing, periodic lockdowns and hygiene protocols were immediately put into force, the infection rates were only temporarily minimized. When infection rates exploded again new variants of the virus began to emerge. Our study focuses on a representative set of sequences from the United States throughout 2020 and early 2021. We show that the driving force behind the variants of public health concern, is widespread infection and superspreader events. In particular, we show accumulation of mutations over time with little loss from genetic drift, including in the Spike region, which could be problematic for vaccines and therapies. This lurking accumulated genetic variation may be a superspreader event from becoming more common and lead to variants that can escape the immune protection provided by the existing vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Many enveloped viruses bud from cholesterol-rich lipid rafts on the cell membrane. Depleting cellular cholesterol impedes this process and results in viral particles with reduced viability. Viperin (virus inhibitory protein endoplasmic reticulum-associated, interferon-induced) is an ER membrane-associated enzyme that when expressed in response to viral infections exerts broad-ranging antiviral effects, including inhibiting the budding of some enveloped viruses. Here we have investigated the effect of viperin expression on cholesterol biosynthesis. We found that viperin expression reduces cholesterol levels by 20 - 30 % in HEK293T cells. A proteomic screen of the viperin interactome identified several cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes among the top hits. The two most highly enriched proteins were lanosterol synthase and squalene monooxygenase, enzymes that catalyze key steps establishing the sterol carbon skeleton. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments established that viperin, lanosterol synthase and squalene monooxygenase form a complex at the ER membrane. Co-expression of viperin was found to significantly inhibit the specific activity of lanosterol synthase in HEK293T cell lysates. Co-expression of viperin had no effect on the specific activity of squalene monooxygenase, but reduced its expression levels in the cells by approximately 30 %. Despite these inhibitory effects, co-expression of either LS or SM failed to reverse the viperin-induced depletion of cellular cholesterol levels in HEK293T cells. Our results establish a clear link between the down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis and viperin, although at this point the effect cannot be unambiguously attributed interactions between viperin and a specific biosynthetic enzyme.",

SdGA is composed mainly by a N-terminal GH15_N domain linked to a C-terminal catalytic domain (CD) found in the GH15 family of glycosylhydrolases with an overall structure similar to other bacterial GAs. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli cells, purified and its biochemical properties were investigated. Although SdGA has a maximum activity at 39{degrees}C and pH 6.0, it also shows high activity in a wide range, from low to mild temperatures, like cold-adapted enzymes. Furthermore, SdGA has a higher content of flexible residues and a larger CD due to various amino acid insertions compared to other thermostable GAs. We propose that this novel SdGA, is a cold-adapted enzyme that might be suitable for use in different industrial processes that require enzymes which act at low or medium temperatures.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly brought the healthcare systems world-wide to a breaking point along with devastating socioeconomic consequences. The SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes the disease uses RNA capping to evade the human immune system. Non-structural protein (nsp) 14 is one of the 16 nsps in SARS-CoV-2 and catalyzes the methylation of the viral RNA at N7-guanosine in the cap formation process. To discover small molecule inhibitors of nsp14 methyltransferase (MT) activity, we developed and employed a radiometric MT assay to screen a library of 161 in house synthesized S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) competitive methyltransferase inhibitors and SAM analogs. Among seven identified screening hits, SS148 inhibited nsp14 MT activity with an IC50 value of 70 {+/-} 6 nM and was selective against 20 human protein lysine methyltransferases indicating significant differences in SAM binding sites. Interestingly, DS0464 with IC50 value of 1.1 {+/-} 0.2 M showed a bi-substrate competitive inhibitor mechanism of action. Modeling the binding of this compound to nsp14 suggests that the terminal phenyl group extends into the RNA binding site. DS0464 was also selective against 28 out of 33 RNA, DNA, and protein methyltransferases. The structure-activity relationship provided by these compounds should guide the optimization of selective bi-substrate nsp14 inhibitors and may provide a path towards a novel class of antivirals against COVID-19, and possibly other coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "The Warburg effect is one of most-well studied metabolic phenomenon in cancer cells. For the most part, these studies have focused on enhanced rates of glycolysis observed in various models. The presumption has been that mitochondrial metabolism is suppressed. However, recent studies indicate that the extent of mitochondrial metabolism is far more heterogeneous in tumors than originally presumed. One tumor type with suppression of mitochondrial metabolism is renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Prior studies indicate that suppressed TCA cycle enzyme mRNA expression is associated with aggressive RCC. Yet, the mechanisms that regulate the TCA cycle in RCC remain uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that loss of TCA cycle enzyme expression is retained in RCC metastatic tissues. Moreover, proteomic analysis demonstrates that reduced TCA cycle enzyme expression is far more pronounced in RCC relative to other tumor types. Loss of TCA cycle enzyme expression is correlated with reduced expression of the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1) which is also lost in RCC tissues. PGC-1 re-expression in RCC cells restores the expression of TCA cycle enzymes in vitro and in vivo and leads to enhanced glucose carbon incorporation into TCA cycle intermediates. Mechanistically, TGF-{beta} signaling, in concert with histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7), suppresses TCA cycle enzyme expression. In turn, pharmacologic inhibition of TGF-{beta} restores expression of TCA cycle enzyme expression and suppresses tumor growth in an orthotopic model of RCC. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel role for the TGF-{beta} /HDAC7 axis in global suppression of TCA cycle enzymes in RCC and provide novel insight into the molecular basis of altered mitochondrial metabolism in this malignancy.",

    "abstract": "SMAD4, a key mediator of TGF-{beta} signaling, plays a crucial role in T cells to prevent chronic gut inflammation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this control remain elusive. Using different genetic and epigenetic approaches, we unexpectedly reveal that SMAD4 in CD8 T cells prevents chronic intestinal inflammation by a feedforward mechanism that is TGF-{beta}-independent. Prior to any TGF-{beta}-receptor engagement, SMAD4 acts as an active and basal repressor of epigenetic, transcriptional and functional TGF-{beta} imprinting in CD8 T cells. Thus, in sharp opposition to total TGF-{beta} signaling deletion, SMAD4 deletion impairs naive CD8 T cell effector predisposition but promotes CD8 T cell accumulation and epithelial retention by promoting their response to IL-7 and their expression of integrins such as Itgae. Besides, SMAD4 deletion unleashes the induction of a wide range of TGF-{beta}-signaling-repressors such as Smad7, Ski, Skil, and Smurf2 and hampers TGF-{beta}-mediated CD8 T cell immunosuppression. Mechanistically, prior to any TGF-{beta} signal, SMAD4 binds to the loci of several TGF-{beta}-target genes, and by regulating histone acetylation, represses their expression. The massive gut epithelial colonization, associated with their escape from the immunoregulatory TGF-{beta} effects overtakes their poor effector preconditioning and elicits microbiota-driven chronic epithelial CD8 T cell activation. Hence, in an anticipatory manner, independently of TGF-{beta}, SMAD4 governs a feedforward regulation of TGF-{beta} effects in CD8 T cells, preventing chronic intestinal inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Fecal source tracking (FST) may be useful to assess pathways of fecal contamination in domestic environments and to estimate the impacts of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions in low-income settings. We measured two non-specific and two human-associated fecal indicators in water, soil, and surfaces before and after a shared latrine intervention from low-income households in Maputo, Mozambique participating in the Maputo Sanitation (MapSan) trial. Up to a quarter of households were impacted by human fecal contamination, but trends were unaffected by improvements to shared sanitation facilities. The intervention reduced E. coli gene concentrations in soil but did not impact culturable E. coli or the prevalence of human FST markers in a difference-in-differences analysis. Using a novel Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach to account for human marker diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, we revealed a high amount of uncertainty associated with human FST measurements and intervention effect estimates. The field of microbial source tracking would benefit from adding measures of diagnostic accuracy to better interpret findings, particularly when FST analyses convey insufficient information for robust inference. With improved measures, FST could help identify dominant pathways of human and animal fecal contamination in communities and guide implementation of effective interventions to safeguard health.\n\nSYNOPSISAn urban sanitation intervention had minimal and highly uncertain effects on human fecal contamination after accounting for fecal indicator sensitivity and specificity.\n\nTOC GRAPHIC/ABSTRACT ART\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/432000v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@312d2dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8cf2caorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@197b549org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fefeb3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Mucosal biofilms play an important role in intestinal health; however, the mucosal bacterial community has been implicated in persistent infections. Clostridioides difficile is an important nosocomial pathogen, with an unacceptable high rate of recurrence following antibiotic treatment. As C. difficile is a known biofilm producer, a property which may contribute to this suboptimal therapeutic response, we have investigated the transcriptional changes and regulatory pathways during the transition from planktonic to biofilm mode of growth. Widespread metabolic reprogramming during biofilm formation was detected, characterised by an increased usage of glycine metabolic pathways to yield key metabolites, which are used for energy production and synthesis of short chain fatty acids. We detected the expression of 107 small non-coding RNAs that appear to, in some part, regulate these pathways; however, 25 of these small RNAs were specifically expressed during biofilm formation, indicating they may play a role in regulating biofilm-specific genes. Similar to Bacillus subtilis, biofilm formation is a multi-regulatory process and SinR negatively regulates biofilm formation independently of other known mechanisms. This comprehensive analysis furthers our understanding of biofilm formation in C. difficile, identifies potential targets for anti-virulence factors, and provides evidence of the link between metabolism and virulence traits.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to Staphylococcus aureus does not lead to immunity as evidenced by the persistent colonization of one third of the human population. S. aureus immune escape is mediated by factors that preempt complement activation, destroy phagocytes, and modify B and T cell responses. One such factor, Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) encompasses five Immunoglobulin binding domains (IgBDs) that associate with the Fc{gamma} domain to block phagocytosis. IgBDs also associate with the Fab domain of VH3-idiotypic IgM which activates B cells with the resulting secretion of antibodies that cannot bind determinants of S. aureus. SpA crosslinking of VH3-idiotypic IgG and IgE receptors of mast cells and basophils promotes histamine release and anaphylaxis. Previous work demonstrated the safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of SpAKKAA, a variant partially defective for VH3-idiotypic Ig cross-linking, in murine models of S. aureus. Compared to mice (10%), humans produce significantly more VH3-idiotypic B cells (50%), prompting a search for safer SpA variants that may be suitably developed as clinical-grade vaccines for efficacy testing in humans. Here, we report the identification of such variants.",

In this study, we have mapped the transcriptional landscape of the various cell populations that compose human teeth at single-cell resolution, and we analyzed in deeper detail their stem cell populations and their microenvironment. Our study identified great cellular heterogeneity in the dental pulp and the periodontium. Unexpectedly, we found that the molecular signatures of the stem cell populations were very similar, and that their distinctive behavior could be due to substantial differences between their microenvironments. Our findings suggest that the microenvironmental specificity is the potential source for the major functional differences of the stem cells located in the various tooth compartments and open new perspectives towards cell-based dental therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Proper attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores is necessary to satisfy the spindle assembly checkpoint and ensure faithful chromosome segregation. Microtubules detach from kinetochores to correct improperly oriented attachments, and overall kinetochore-microtubule (k-MT) attachment stability is determined in response to regulatory enzymes and the activities of kinetochore-associated microtubule stabilizing and destabilizing proteins. However, it is unknown whether regulatory enzyme activity or kinetochore-associated protein localization respond to subtle changes in k-MT attachment stability. To test for this feedback response, we monitored Aurora B kinase activity and the localization of select kinetochore proteins in metaphase cells following treatments that subtly stabilize or destabilize k-MT attachments using low dose Taxol or UMK57 (an MCAK agonist), respectively. Increasing k-MT stability induced changes in the abundance of some kinetochore proteins. In contrast, reducing k-MT stability induced both increases in Aurora B kinase signaling and changes in the abundance of some kinetochore proteins. Thus, kinetochores dynamically respond to changes in the stability of their attached microtubules. This feedback control contributes to tuning k-MT attachment stability required for efficient error correction to facilitate faithful chromosome segregation.\n\nSummary StatementLive cell imaging demonstrates that kinetochore signaling responds to feedback from attached microtubules to tune their stability to ensure faithful chromosome segregation during cell division.",

    "abstract": "Angiotensin II (AngII) binds to the type I angiotensin receptor in the adrenal cortex to initiate a cascade of events leading to the production of aldosterone, a master regulator of blood pressure. Despite extensive characterization of the transcriptional and enzymatic control of adrenocortical steroidogenesis, there are still major gaps in our knowledge related to precise regulation of AII-induced gene expression kinetics. Specifically, we do not know the regulatory contribution of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and RNA decay, which can control the timing of stimulus-induced gene expression. To investigate this question, we performed a high-resolution RNA-seq time course of the AngII stimulation response and 4-thiouridine pulse labeling in a steroidogenic human cell line (H295R). We identified twelve temporally distinct gene expression responses that contained mRNA encoding proteins known to be important for various steps of aldosterone production, such as cAMP signaling components and steroidogenic enzymes. AngII response kinetics for many of these mRNAs revealed a coordinated increase in both synthesis and decay. These findings were validated in primary human adrenocortical cells stimulated ex vivo with AngII. Using a candidate siRNA screen, we identified a subset of RNA-binding protein and RNA decay factors that activate or repress AngII-stimulated aldosterone production. Among the repressors of aldosterone were BTG2, which promotes deadenylation and global RNA decay. BTG2 was induced in response to AngII stimulation and promoted the repression of mRNAs encoding pro-steroidogenic factors indicating the existence of an incoherent feedforward loop controlling aldosterone homeostasis. Together, these data support a model in which coordinated increases in transcription and regulated RNA decay facilitates the major transcriptomic changes required to implement a pro-steroidogenic gene expression program that is temporally restricted to prevent aldosterone overproduction.",

Rsu-1 interacts with a zinc-finger type multi LIM domain-containing adaptor protein PINCH-1 involved in the integrin-mediated consensus adhesome but not with highly homologous isoform PINCH-2. However, the structural basis for such specific interaction and regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Here, we determined the crystal structures of Rsu-1 and its complex with the PINCH-1 LIM4-5 domains. Rsu-1 displays an arc-shaped solenoid architecture with eight LRRs shielded by the N- and C-terminal capping modules. We show that a large conserved concave surface of the Rsu-1 LRR domain recognizes the PINCH-1 LIM5 domain, and that the C-terminal non-LIM region of PINCH-2 but not PINCH-1 sterically disfavors the Rsu-1 binding. We further show that Rsu-1 can be assembled, via PINCH-1-binding, into a tight hetero-pentamer complex comprising Rsu-1, PINCH-1, ILK, Parvin, and Kindlin-2 that constitute a major consensus integrin adhesome crucial for focal adhesion assembly. Consistently, our mutagenesis and cell biological data consolidate the significance of the Rsu-1/PINCH-1 interaction in focal adhesion assembly and cell spreading. Our results provide a crucial molecular insight into Rsu-1-mediated cell adhesion with implication on how it may regulate tumorigenic growth.",

Analysis in novel microfluidics-derived microtissues and in vivo demonstrates decreased extrusion and invasion following focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibition, consistent with decreased metastasis. Thus, data suggest that targeting FAK or strategies to re-engineer and normalize tumor microenvironments, may have a role not only in also in very early disease but also for limiting continued dissemination from unresectable disease. Likewise, it may be beneficial to employ stroma targeting strategies to resolve precursor diseases such as pancreatitis in order to remove stromal architectures that increase risk for early dissemination.\n\nImpact StatementCollagen architectures in the tumor stroma facilitate dissemination of carcinoma cells from the earliest histologically \"pre-malignant\" lesions and continue to promote disease spread from well-differentiated PDA.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOncogene-induced replication stress characterizes many aggressive cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Several drugs are being developed that target replication stress, although it is unclear how tumors with high levels of replication stress can be identified. We aimed to develop a gene expression signature of oncogene-induced replication stress.\n\nMethodsTNBC and non-transformed RPE1-TP53wt and RPE1-TP53mut cell lines were engineered to overexpress the oncogenes CDC25A, CCNE1 or MYC. DNA fiber analysis was used to measure replication kinetics. Analysis of RNA sequencing data of cell lines and patient-derived tumor samples (TCGA n=10,592) was used to identify differential gene expression. Immunohistochemical validation was conducted on breast cancer samples (n=330).\n\nResultsRNA sequencing revealed 52 commonly upregulated genes after induction of CDC25A, CCNE1 or MYC in our cell line panel. Integration with gene expression data of TGCA samples with amplification of replication stress-inducing oncogenes (CDC25A, CCNE1, MYC, CCND1, MYB, MOS, KRAS, ERBB2, and E2F1), yielded a six-gene signature of oncogene-induced replication stress (NAT10, DDX27, ZNF48, C8ORF33, MOCS3, and MPP6). Expression of NAT10 in breast cancer samples was correlated with phospho-RPA (R=0.451, p=1.82x10-20) and {gamma}H2AX (R=0.304, p=2.95x10-9). Applying the oncogene-induced replication stress signature to patient samples (TCGA n=8,862 and GEO n=13,912) defined the replication stress landscape across 27 tumor subtypes, and identified diffuse large B cell lymphoma, ovarian cancer, TNBC and colorectal carcinoma as cancer subtypes with high levels of oncogene-induced replication stress.\n\nConclusionWe developed a gene expression signature of oncogene-induced replication stress, which may facilitate patient selection for agents that target replication stress.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodesmata are unique channel structures in plants that link the fluid cytoplasm between adjacent cells. Plants have evolved these microchannels to allow trafficking of nutritious substances as well as signaling molecules for intercellular communication. However, tracking the behavior of plasmodesmata in real time is difficult because they are located inside tissues. Hence, we developed a microfluidic device that traps cultured cells and fixes their positions to allow testing of plasmodesmata permeability. The device has 112 tandemly aligned trap zones in the flow channel. Cells of the tobacco line BY-2 were cultured for 7 days and filtered using a sieve and a cell strainer before use to isolate short cell clusters consisting of only a few cells. The isolated cells were introduced into the flow channel, resulting in entrapment of cell clusters at 25 out of 112 trap zones (22.3%). Plasmodesmata permeability was tested from 1 to 4 days after trapping the cells. During this period, the cell numbers increased through cell division. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments using a transgenic marker line expressing nuclear-localized H2B-GFP demonstrated that cell-to-cell movement of H2B-GFP protein occurred within 200 min of photobleaching. The transport of H2B-GFP protein was not observed when sodium chloride, a compound known to cause plasmodesmata closure, was present in the microfluid channel. Thus, this microfluidic device and one-dimensional plant cell samples allowed us to observe plasmodesmata behavior in real time under controllable conditions.",

    "abstract": "Oropouche virus (OROV) infection of humans is associated with a debilitating febrile illness that can progress to meningitis or encephalitis. First isolated from a forest worker in Trinidad and Tobago in 1955, the arbovirus OROV has since been detected throughout the Amazon basin with an estimated 500,000 human infections. Like other members of the family Peribunyaviridae, the viral genome exists as 3 single-stranded negative-sense RNA segments. The medium sized segment encodes a viral glycoprotein complex (GPC) that is proteolytically processed into two viral envelope proteins Gn and Gc responsible for attachment and membrane fusion. There are no therapeutics or vaccines to combat OROV infection, and we have little understanding of protective immunity to infection. Here we generated a replication competent chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), in which the endogenous glycoprotein was replaced by the GPC of OROV. Serum from mice immunized with VSV-OROV specifically neutralized wild type OROV, and using peptide arrays we mapped multiple epitopes within an N-terminal variable region of Gc recognized by the immune sera. VSV-OROV lacking this variable region of Gc was also immunogenic in mice producing neutralizing sera that recognize additional regions of Gc. Challenge of both sets of immunized mice with wild type OROV shows that the VSV-OROV chimeras reduce wild type viral infection and suggest that antibodies that recognize the variable N-terminus of Gc afford less protection than those that target more conserved regions of Gc.\n\nImportanceOropouche virus (OROV), an orthobunyavirus found in Central and South America, is an emerging public health challenge that causes debilitating febrile illness. OROV is transmitted by arthropods, and increasing mobilization has the potential to significantly increase the spread of OROV globally. Despite this, no therapeutics or vaccines have been developed to combat infection. Using vesicular stomatitis (VSV) as a backbone, we developed a chimeric virus bearing the OROV glycoproteins (VSV-OROV) and tested its ability to elicit a neutralizing antibody response. Our results demonstrate that VSV-OROV produces a strong neutralizing antibody response that is at least partially targeted to the N-terminal region of Gc. Importantly, vaccination with VSV-OROV reduces viral loads in mice challenged with wildtype virus. This data provides the first evidence that targeting the OROV glycoproteins may be an effective vaccination strategy to combat OROV infection.",

Defining common determinants of host susceptibility to this large group of heterogenous pathogens are key for informing the rational design of new pan-viral medicines. Infection of the vertebrate host with these viruses is enhanced by the presence of mosquito saliva, a complex mixture of salivary gland-derived factors and microbiota. We show that enhancement of infection by saliva was dependent on vascular function and was independent of most anti-saliva immune responses, including to salivary microbiota. Instead, the Aedes gene product sialokinin mediated enhancement of virus infection through a rapid reduction in endothelial barrier integrity. Sialokinin is unique within the insect world as having vertebrate-like tachykinin sequence and is absent from non-vector competent Anopheles mosquitoes, whose saliva was not pro-viral and did not induce similar vascular permeability. Therapeutic strategies targeting sialokinin have potential to limit disease severity following infection with Aedes mosquito-borne viruses.",

    "abstract": "Mice are a widely used pre-clinical model system in large part due to their potential for genetic manipulation. The ability to manipulate gene expression in specific cells under temporal control is a powerful experimental tool. The liver is central to metabolic homeostasis and a site of many diseases, making the targeting of hepatocytes attractive. Adeno-Associated Virus 8 (AAV8) vectors are valuable instruments for the manipulation of hepatocellular gene expression. However, their off-target effects in mice have not been thoroughly explored. Here, we sought to identify the short-term off-target effects of AAV8 administration in mice. To do this, we injected C57BL/6J Wild-Type mice with either recombinant AAV8 vectors expressing Cre recombinase or empty AAV8 vectors and characterised the changes in general health and in liver physiology, histology and transcriptomics compared to uninjected controls over 1 week. We observed an acute and transient reduction in homeostatic liver proliferation together with induction of the DNA damage marker {gamma}H2AX following AAV8 administration. The latter was enhanced upon Cre recombinase expression by the vector. Furthermore, we observed transcriptional changes in genes involved in circadian rhythm and response to infection. Notably, there were no additional transcriptomic changes upon expression of Cre recombinase by the AAV8 vector. Overall, there was no evidence of liver injury, dysfunction or leukocyte infiltration following AAV8 infection. These data support the use of AAV8-based Cre recombinase delivery as a specific tool for hepatocellular gene manipulation with minimal effects on murine physiology but highlight the off target effects of these systems.\n\nSummary statementThis paper provides a comprehensive characterisation of the short-term effects of administration of Adeno-Associated Virus 8 on murine physiology, liver histology and liver transcriptome.",

The role of a majority of these maternally expressed factors in adult fertility and early development is not fully understood. By exploiting the biallelic editing ability of CRISPR-Cas9 and the benefits of the zebrafish model, we identify and characterize maternal-effect genes in a single generation, using a maternal crispant technique. We validated the ability to generate biallelic mutations in the germline by creating maternal crispants that phenocopied previously characterized maternal-effect genes: motley/birc5b, tmi/prc1l, and aura/mid1ip1. Additionally, by targeting maternally expressed genes of unknown function in zebrafish, we identified two new maternal-effect zebrafish genes, kpna7 and fhcd3. The genetic identity of these maternal crispants was confirmed by sequencing haploid progeny from F0 females, which allowed the sequence analysis of newly induced lesions in the maternal germ line. Analysis of the induced lesions shows minimal genetic variation within a clutch, with an average of two edited alleles per clutch. These findings are consistent with biallelic editing events occurring in germ cells or their precursors of early CRISPR-Cas9-injected embryos, leading to maternal-effect phenotypes in the offspring. Our studies show that maternal crispants allow for the effective identification and primary characterization of maternal-effect genes in a single generation, facilitating the reverse genetics analysis of maternal factors that drive embryonic development.",

We aimed to characterize the nature of their genomes, the repetitive DNA, and the genome composition of polyploids, leading to a model of the evolutionary pathways within the group including many apomictic species.\n\nMethodsSome 362 forage grass accessions from international germplasm collections were studied, and ploidy determined using an optimized flow cytometry method. Whole-genome survey sequencing and molecular cytogenetic analysis with in situ hybridization to chromosomes were used to identify chromosomes and genomes in Urochloa accessions belonging to the different agamic complexes.\n\nKey ResultsGenome structures are complex and variable, with multiple ploidies and genome compositions within the species, and no clear geographical patterns. Sequence analysis of nine diploid and polyploid accessions enabled identification of abundant genome-specific repetitive DNA motifs. In situ hybridization with a combination of repetitive DNA and genomic DNA probes, identified evolutionary divergence and allowed us to discriminate the different genomes present in polyploids.\n\nConclusionsWe suggest a new coherent nomenclature for the genomes present. We develop a model of evolution at the whole-genome level in diploid and polyploid accessions showing processes of grass evolution. We support the retention of narrow species concepts for U. brizantha, U. decumbens, and U. ruziziensis. The results and model will be valuable in making rational choices of parents for new hybrids, assist in use of the germplasm for breeding and selection of Urochloa with improved sustainability and agronomic potential, and will assist in measuring and conserving biodiversity in grasslands.",

    "abstract": "The functional amyloid Orb2 belongs to the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding (CPEB) protein family and plays an important role in long-term memory formation in Drosophila. The Orb2 domain structure combines RNA recognition motifs with low complexity sequences similar to many RNA binding proteins shown to form protein droplets via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vivo and in vitro. This similarity suggests that Orb2 might also undergo LLPS. However, cellular Orb2 puncta have very little internal protein mobility and Orb2 forms fibrils in Drosophila brains that are functionally active indicating that LLPS might not play a role for Orb2. In the present work, we reconcile these two views on Orb2 droplet formation. We show that soluble Orb2 can indeed phase separate into protein droplets. However, these droplets have either no or only an extremely short-lived liquid phase and appear maturated right after formation. For Orb2 fragments that lack the C-terminal RNA binding domain (RBD), droplet formation is a prerequisite for fibril formation of an otherwise stable monomeric Orb2 solution. Solid-state NMR shows that these fibrils have additional well ordered static domains beside the Gln/His-rich fibril core. Further, we find that full-length Orb2B, which is by far the major component of Orb2 fibrils in vivo, does not transition into cross-{beta} fibrils but remains in the droplet phase. Together, our data suggest that phase separation might play a role in initiating the formation of functional Orb2 fibrils.",

    "abstract": "During metastasis, cancer cells must adapt to survive a loss of anchorage and evade anoikis. An important pro-survival adaptation is the ability of metastatic tumor cells to increase their antioxidant capacity and restore cellular redox balance. Although much is known about the transcriptional regulation of antioxidant enzymes in response to stress, how cells rapidly adapt to alter antioxidant enzyme levels is less well understood. Using ovarian cancer cells as a model, we demonstrate that an increase in protein expression of the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase SOD2 is a very early event initiated in response to cellular detachment. SOD2 protein synthesis is rapidly induced within 0.5-2 hours of matrix detachment, and polyribosome profiling demonstrates an increase in the number of ribosomes bound to SOD2 mRNA, indicating an increase in SOD2 translation in response to anchorage-independence. Mechanistically, we find that anchorage-independence specifically induces cytosolic accumulation of the RNA binding protein HuR/ELAVL1 and leads to increased HuR binding to SOD2 mRNA. Using HuR siRNA-mediated knock-down, we show that the presence of HuR is necessary for the increase in SOD2 mRNA association with the heavy polyribosome fraction and SOD2 protein synthesis observed in anchorage-independence. Cellular detachment activates the stress-response protein kinase p38 MAPK, which is necessary for HuR-SOD2 mRNA binding and optimal increases in SOD2 protein expression. These findings illustrate a novel post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of SOD2, enabling cells to rapidly increase their mitochondrial antioxidant capacity as an acute response to anchorage-independence.",

Using novel so-called saturation indices, we show that the conjunction of absorbing states and renormalization yields an exploration of the PPIN which is much more progressive than that afforded by random walks with restarts only. Using MINT as underlying network, we apply Genetrank to a predictive gene signature of cancer cells sensitivity to tumor-necrosis-factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), performed in single-cells. Our ranking provides biological insights on drug sensitivity and a gene set considerably enriched in genes regulating TRAIL pharmacodynamics when compared to the most significant differentially expressed genes obtained from a statistical analysis framework alone. We also introduce gene expression radars, a visualization tool to assess all pairwise interactions at a glance.\n\nGenetrank is made available in the Structural Bioinformatics Library (https://sbl.inria.fr/doc/Genetrank-user-manual.html). It should prove useful for mining gene sets in conjunction with a signaling pathway, whenever other approaches yield relatively large sets of genes.",

    "abstract": "Pathogen infection triggers host innate defenses which can lead to the activation of regulated cell death (RCD) pathways such as apoptosis. Given a key role in immunity, apoptotic effectors are often counteracted by pathogen-encoded antagonists. Mounting evidence indicates that programmed necrosis, which is mediated by the RIPK3/MLKL axis and termed necroptosis, evolved as a countermeasure to pathogen-mediated inhibition of apoptotic signaling. However, whether this emerging inflammatory RCD pathway functions primarily as a \"back-up\" or fundamental response remains inconclusive. We hypothesized that if necroptosis is an instrumental defense, then its effectors should display specific signatures associated with pathogen conflict that are rare in combination: rapid evolution, viral homolog hereafter virolog, and induction by cytokines (e.g. interferons). Our rapid evolution analysis across the necroptosis pathway revealed: 1) strong signatures of positive selection for RIPK3 and MLKL in primate genomes and to a lesser extent DAI/ZBP1, 2) elevated rates of amino acid substitution on multiple surfaces including the RIPK3/MLKL binding interface and 3) evidence supporting a means of activating RIPK3 independent of homotypic RHIM domain interactions. Interestingly, a poxvirus MLKL homolog has recently been identified that acts as a RIPK3 pseudosubstrate. Our findings indicate that poxvirus MLKLs are also subject to similar but distinct volatile patterns of evolution comparable to host necroptotic factors. Specifically, viral MLKLs have undergone numerous gains and losses in poxvirus evolution with some species harboring three distinct copies. Furthermore, we confirm that MLKL can be induced by cytokines like interferon gamma. In summary, MLKL displays all three hallmarks of pivotal immune factors of which only OAS1, but not other factors like cGAS, APOBEC3G, or PKR, exhibits. These data support the hypothesis that over evolutionary time, necroptosis has served as a key battleground during infection and is therefore, not an auxiliary response.\n\nSummaryRegulated cell death (RCD), such as apoptosis, is a common host defense against invading pathogens. Necroptosis, an inflammatory RCD pathway, is thought to have emerged as an auxiliary response when other cell death pathways are suppressed by pathogens during infection. In our analyses, we have identified genetic changes in host and viral factors associated with necroptosis that display signatures of adaptation and may have served as evolutionary countermeasures to shape infection outcomes. Consistent with repeated targeting by pathogen-encoded inhibitors, we found robust signatures of rapid evolution for the essential catalysts of necroptosis, RIPK3 and MLKL. Notably, an evolutionary signature specific to RIPK3 for a domain shared with other necroptotic factors suggests an undefined means to trigger this host defense pathway. In contrast, poxviruses appear to circumvent this pathway by constantly altering the number and nature of factors they deploy to suppress necroptosis including a mimic of MLKL, which was stolen from infected cells. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into host and viral genetics that may influence infection outcomes and the factors shaping the ability of pathogens to infect and spread to new species. Furthermore, these data support the notion that necroptosis is a fundamental, not auxiliary, host response during infection.",

Compared to the ample knowledge on cancer-associated fibroblast residing within iCCA tumor mass, little is known about the fibrotic response from the tumor-surrounding liver and its role in iCCA development. In this study, we find a significant accumulation of peritumoral myofibroblasts (pMFs) in both patient iCCA and tumors from an iCCA orthotopic allograft mouse model. Using tumor and liver spheroid coculture we show that iCCA-liver interaction induces rapid pMF accumulation at the interface. We find pMFs placed around iCCA spheroids exert a strong suppressive effect on tumor cells growth, in contrast to the pro-proliferative effect of MFs mixed within tumor spheroids. However, prolonged iCCA-pMF interaction elicits tumor cell dissemination in vitro. We find an upregulation of Vcam1 in tumor cells in the early phase of iCCA-pMF interaction both in vitro and in vivo which is downregulated when tumor cells disseminate. Blocking Vcam1 activity in iCCA allograft mouse models slows primary tumor growth but lead to increased tumor metastasis. Our data suggest that pMFs are beyond simple pro- or anti-tumorigenic in iCCA, with the ability to suppress tumor growth but elicit tumor cell dissemination.",

    "abstract": "The comparative assessment of genetically-modified (GM) crops relies on the principle of substantial equivalence, which states that such products should be compared to conventional counterparts that have an established history of safe use. In an effort to operationalize this principle, the GMO Panel of the European Food Safety Authority proposed an equivalence test that directly compares a GM test variety with a set of unrelated, conventionally-bred reference varieties with part of the difference as the known background of the test (the same as the given control). The criterion of the EFSA test, however, is defined solely by genotypic differences between the non-traited control and reference varieties (i.e. the background effect) while assuming the so-called GM trait effect as zero. As the outcome of an EFSA equivalence test is determined primarily by the similarity, or lack thereof, of the control and references, a conditional equivalence criterion is proposed in this investigation that focuses on \"unintended\" effects of a GM trait which is irrespective of the (random) genotypic value of a given control. The new criterion also includes a mean-scaled standard similar to the 80-125% rule for bioequivalence assessment practiced in the pharmaceutical industry as an alternative when the reference variation is zero or close to zero. In addition, optional criteria are proposed with a step-wise procedure to control the rate of false negatives (non-equivalence by chance) providing a comprehensive assessment under multiple comparisons. An application to maize grain composition data demonstrates that the conditional equivalence criterion provides effect-specific and more robust assessment of equivalence than the EFSA criterion did, especially for GM traits showing negligible or no unintended effects which are likely true for most traits in the current market.",

    "abstract": "One should assume that in silico experiments in systems biology are less susceptible to reproducibility issues than their wet-lab counterparts, because they are free from natural biological variations and their environment can be fully controlled. However, recent studies show that only half of the published mathematical models of biological systems can be reproduced without substantial effort. In this article we examine the potential causes for failed or cumbersome reproductions in a case study of a one-dimensional mathematical model of the atrioventricular node, which took us four months to reproduce. The model demonstrates that even otherwise rigorous studies can be hard to reproduce due to missing information, errors in equations and parameters, a lack in available data files, non-executable code, missing or incomplete experiment protocols, and missing rationales behind equations. Many of these issues seem similar to problems that have been solved in software engineering using techniques such as unit testing, regression tests, continuous integration, version control, archival services, and a thorough modular design with extensive documentation. Applying these techniques, we reimplement the examined model using the modeling language Modelica. The resulting workflow is independent of the model and can be translated to SBML, CellML, and other languages. It guarantees methods reproducibility by executing automated tests in a virtual machine on a server that is physically separated from the development environment. Additionally, it facilitates results reproducibility, because the model is more understandable and because the complete model code, experiment protocols, and simulation data are published and can be accessed in the exact version that was used in this article. We found the additional design and documentation effort well justified, even just considering the immediate benefits during development such as easier and faster debugging, increased understandability of equations, and a reduced requirement for looking up details from the literature.\n\nAuthor summaryReproducibility is one of the cornerstones of the scientific method. In order to draw reliable conclusions, an experiment must yield the same results when it is repeated using the same methods. However, biological systems are complex, which makes experiments cumbersome. It is therefore desirable to build a mathematical representation of the biological system, which captures its essential behavior in a set of variables and equations and allows for easier and faster experimentation. Unfortunately, recent studies have shown that half of the published mathematical models are not immediately reproducible due to missing information, mathematical errors, and incomplete documentation. These issues are similar to those faced in software engineering: A single missing file or a buggy line of code can render any kind of software useless. Software engineering has turned to rigorous software testing, automated development pipelines, and version control systems to overcome these challenges, but these techniques are not yet widely applied to mathematical modeling. In this paper we demonstrate their benefit for the reproducibility of a large mathematical model of the atrioventricular node. The software engineering solutions that we employ can be applied to any mathematical model and could therefore facilitate scientific progress by encouraging and simplifying model reuse.",

Conventional electron microscopy using chemically fixed, metal-stained tissue has identified a proteinaceous, membrane-associated thickening called the  postsynaptic density (PSD). Here, we combined mouse genetics and cryo-electron tomography to determine the 3D molecular architecture of fresh synapses in the adult forebrain. The native glutamatergic synapse lacked a PSD. Instead, a concentrated  synaptoplasm consisting of cytoskeletal elements, macromolecular complexes and membrane-bound organelles extended throughout the pre- and post-synaptic compartments. Snapshots of active processes gave insights into the architectural basis for synaptic remodeling.

Here, we assessed the replicability and reliability of two connectome-generating methods, voxel- or surface-based, using test-retest analyses, fingerprinting and age prediction. The two connectomic methods are initiated by the same state-of-the-art dMRI processing pipeline before diverging at the tractography and connectome-generating steps using either voxels or surfaces. While both methods performed very well across all analyses, voxel-based connectomes performed marginally better than surface-based connectomes. Notably, structural connectomes derived from either method demonstrate reliably accurate representations of both individuals and their chronological age, comparable to similar analyses employing multi-modal features. The difference in methodological performance could be attributed to a number of method-specific features but ultimately show that cutting-edge tractography with robust dMRI processing produces reliable white matter connectivity measures.",

During locomotion, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans spontaneously cycles between forward runs, reversals, and turns with complex but predictable dynamics. Here we provide insight into these dynamics by demonstrating how RIM interneurons, which are active during reversals, act in two modes to stabilize both forward runs and reversals. By systematically quantifying the roles of RIM outputs during spontaneous behavior, we show that RIM lengthens reversals when depolarized through glutamate and tyramine neurotransmitters and lengthens forward runs when hyperpolarized through its gap junctions. RIM is not merely silent upon hyperpolarization: RIM gap junctions actively reinforce a hyperpolarized state of the reversal circuit. Additionally, the combined outputs of chemical synapses and gap junctions from RIM regulate forward-to-reversal transitions. Our results indicate that multiple classes of RIM synapses create behavioral inertia during spontaneous locomotion.",

    "abstract": "In tropical countries such as Sri Lanka, where leptospirosis--a deadly disease with a high mortality rate--is endemic, prediction is required for public health planning and resource allocation. Routinely collected meteorological data may offer an effective means of making such predictions. This study included monthly leptospirosis and meteorological data from January 2007 to April 2019 from Sri Lanka. Factor analysis was used first with rainfall data to classify districts into meteorological zones. We used a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model for univariate predictions and autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model for multivariable analysis of leptospirosis with monthly average rainfall, temperature, relative humidity (RH), solar radiation (SR) and the number of rainy days/month (RD). Districts were classified into wet (WZ) and dry (DZ) zones and highlands (HL) based on the factor analysis of rainfall data. The WZ had the highest leptospirosis incidence; there was no difference in the incidence between the DZ and HL. Leptospirosis was fluctuated positively with rainfall, RH and RD, whereas temperature and SR were fluctuated negatively. ARIMA(1,0,0)(0,1,1)12, ARIMA(1,0,0)(1,1,1)12, and ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)12 were the best univariate models for DZ, WZ, and HL, respectively. Despite its known association, rainfall was positively significant in the WZ only at lag 5 (P = 0.03) but was negatively associated at lag 2 and 3 (P = 0.04). RD was positively associated for all three zones. Temperature was positively associated at lag 0 for the WZ and HL (P < 0.009) and was negatively associated at lag 1 for the WZ (P = 0.01). There was no association with RH in contrast to previous studies. Based on altitude and rainfall data, meteorological variables could effectively predict the incidence of leptospirosis with different models for different climatic zones. These predictive models could be effectively used in public health planning purposes.",

Vaccines for ND control are available but the delivery of safe and potent vaccines in resource-poor settings remains a big challenge due to difficulties in the maintenance of cold chain. This paper reports the results of a study that was carried out in Kenya to assess the storage and handling practices of Newcastle disease vaccines by agro-veterinary shops (agro-shops) during acquisition, storage, and sale to smallholders farmers. Data were collected from one hundred and thirty-two agro-shops using semi-structured questionnaires, observation sheets and actual purchase of vaccines over the counter. The results showed that the majority (82 percent) of the agro-shops had a domestic refrigerator that was connected to the electricity grid but many (61 percent) did not have power backup. Sixty percent of them only stocked thermolabile vaccines. Recurrent power outages (62 percent), high cost of electricity (62 percent), and long-distance to vaccine sources (33 percent) were the most common challenges in vaccine storage and sale. Some agro-shops switched refrigerators on and off while others removed vaccines from refrigerators for overnight stay in cool boxes to minimize electricity costs. In some cases, the sale of vaccines was restricted to market days and late afternoon when ambient temperatures were lower to minimize vaccines storage time and vaccine spoilage respectively. Thermostable vaccines were not stored as recommended by the manufacturer and few agro-shops (23 percent) sold reconstituted vaccines. Most shops adequately packaged thermolabile vaccines in improvised materials during sale. Overall, most of the ND vaccine handling and storage practices in the last mile appeared to aim at safeguarding the safety and potency of vaccines, but further research could elucidate the effects of these practices on the quality and potency of ND vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Conotoxins are a large group of naturally occurring toxic peptides produced by the predatory sea snails of the genus Conus. Many of these toxins target ion channels, often with high specificity and affinity. As such, they have proven to be invaluable for basic research as well as acting as leads for therapeutic strategies. Con-ikot-ikot is the only conotoxin so far identified that targets AMPA-type glutamate receptors, the main mediators of excitatory neurotransmission in the vertebrate brain. Here, we describe how the toxin modifies the activity of AMPA receptors at the single-channel level. The toxin binds to the AMPA receptor with high affinity (EC50 = 5 nM) and once bound, takes minutes to wash out. As shown previously, it effectively blocks desensitization of AMPA receptors, however, compared to other desensitisation blockers, it is a poor stabiliser of the open channel because toxin-bound AMPA receptors undergo frequent, brief closures. We propose this is a direct consequence of the toxins unique binding mode to the ligand binding domains. Unlike other blockers of desensitization, which stabilise individual dimers within an AMPA receptor tetramer, the toxin immobilizes all four ligand binding domains of the tetramer. This result further emphasises that quaternary reorganization of independent LBD dimers is essential for the full activity of AMPA receptors.",

    "abstract": "The ability of epithelial cells to rewire their cell fate program beyond their physiological repertoire has become a new paradigm in stem cell biology. This plasticity leaves behind the concept of strict stem cell hierarchies, opening up new exciting questions about its limits and underlying regulation. Here we developed a heterotypic 3D culture system to study the mechanisms modulating changes in the identity of adult esophageal epithelial cells. We demonstrate that, when exposed to the foreign stroma of adult skin, esophageal cells transition towards hair follicle identity and architecture. Heterotypic transplantation experiments recapitulated this cell fate conversion process in vivo. Single-cell RNA sequencing and histological analysis, capturing the temporality of this process, reveal that most esophageal cells switching towards skin identity remain in an intermediate state marked by a transient regenerative profile and a particularly strong hypoxic signature. Inhibition of HIF1a establishes the central role of this pathway in regulating epithelial cell plasticity, driving cells away from their transition state in favor of cell fate conversion.",

    "abstract": "The cell membrane is one of the most important structures of life. Understanding its functioning is essential for several human knowledge areas, mainly how it controls the efflux of substances between the cytoplasm and the environment. Being a complex structure, composed of several classes of compounds such as lipids, proteins, sugars, etc., a convenient way to mimic it is through a phospholipid bilayer. The Molecular Dynamics simulation of lipid bilayers in solution is the main computational approach to model the cell membrane. In this work, we present a method to detect permeation events of molecules through the lipid bilayer, characterizing its crossing time and trajectory. By splitting the simulation box into well-defined regions, the method distinguishes the passage of molecules through the bilayer from artifacts produced by crossing molecules through the simulation box edges when using periodic boundary conditions. We apply the method to study the spontaneous permeation of water molecules through bilayers with different lipid compositions and modeled with different force fields. Our method successfully characterizes the permeation events, and the results obtained show that the frequency and time of permeation are independent of the force field used to model the phospholipids. Besides, it is observed that the increase in the concentration of cholesterol molecules in lipid bilayers induces the reduction of permeation events due to its compacting action on the bilayer, making it denser and, therefore, hindering the diffusion of water molecules inside it. The computational tool to perform the method discussed here is available on https://github.com/crobertocamilo/MD-permeation.",

    "abstract": "Nucleic acid aptamers are generated by an in vitro molecular evolution method known as systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). A variety of candidates is limited by actual sequencing data from an experiment. Here, we developed RaptGen, which is a variational autoencoder for in silico aptamer generation. RaptGen exploits a profile hidden Markov model decoder to represent motif sequences effectively. We showed that RaptGen embedded simulation sequence data into low-dimension latent space dependent on motif information. We also performed sequence embedding using two independent SELEX datasets. RaptGen successfully generated aptamers from the latent space even though they were not included in high-throughput sequencing. RaptGen could also generate a truncated aptamer with a short learning model. We demonstrated that RaptGen could be applied to activity-guided aptamer generation according to Bayesian optimization. We concluded that a generative method by RaptGen and latent representation are useful for aptamer discovery. Codes are available at https://github.com/hmdlab/raptgen.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains resistant to most treatments and demonstrates a complex pathobiology. Here, we deconvolute regional heterogeneity in the human PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME), a long-standing obstacle, to define precise stromal contributions to PDAC progression. Large scale integration of histology-guided multiOMICs with clinical data sets and functional in vitro models uncovers two microenvironmental programs in PDAC that were anchored in fibroblast differentiation states. These sub-tumor microenvironments (subTMEs) co-occurred intratumorally and were spatially confined, producing patient-specific cellular and molecular heterogeneity associated with shortened patient survival. Each subTME was uniquely structured to support discrete aspects of tumor biology: reactive regions rich in activated fibroblast communities were immune-hot and promoted aggressive tumor progression while deserted regions enriched in extracellular matrix supported tumor differentiation yet were markedly chemoprotective. In conclusion, PDAC regional heterogeneity derives from biologically distinct reactive and protective TME elements with a defined, active role in PDAC progression.\n\nGraphical Abstract & Key findings\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=191 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/431890v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (73K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17adabdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@aee778org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@deae00org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1718272_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG O_LIPDAC regional heterogeneity originates in sub-tumor microenvironments (subTMEs)\nC_LIO_LISubTMEs exhibit distinct immune phenotypes and CAF differentiation states\nC_LIO_LIDifferent subTMEs are either tumor-promoting or chemoprotective\nC_LIO_LIIntratumoral subTME co-occurrence links stromal heterogeneity to patient outcome\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAV) are extensively used as gene delivery vectors in clinical studies, and several rAAV based treatments have already been approved. Significant progress has been made in rAAV manufacturing, and large-scale vector production and purification methods have been developed. However, a better and more precise capsid characterization techniques are still needed to guarantee the purity and safety of the rAAV preparations. A recently developed single-molecule technique, mass photometry (MP), measures mass distributions of biomolecules with high resolution and sensitivity. Here we explore applications of MP for the characterization of capsid fractions. We demonstrate that MP is able to resolve and quantify not only empty and full-genome containing capsid populations, but also identify the partially packaged capsid impurities. MP data accurately measures full and empty capsid ratios, and can be used to estimate the size of the encapsidated genome. MP distributions provide information on sample heterogeneity and on the presence of aggregates. Current analytical techniques used to characterize rAAV preparations are susceptible to background signals, have limited accuracy, or are time-consuming and require a large amount of material. MP can analyze sub-picomole quantities of sample, and data can be obtained and analyzed within minutes. This method provides a simple, robust, and effective tool to monitor physical attributes of rAAV vectors.",

The top part of the door seal showed the lowest contamination (11.1 {+/-} 9.2 x 101 CFU cm-2), probably due to less humidity.\n\nOut of 212 isolates, 178 (84%) were identified on genus level and 118 (56%) on species level using MALDI biotyping, resulting in 29 genera and 40 identified species across all machines.

    "abstract": "Exoskeletons that assist the hip, knee, and ankle joints have begun to improve human mobility, particularly by reducing the metabolic cost of walking. However, direct comparisons of optimal assistance of these joints, or their combinations, have not yet been possible. Assisting multiple joints may be more beneficial than the sum of individual effects, because muscles often span multiple joints, or less effective, because single-joint assistance can indirectly aid other joints. In this study, we used a hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton emulator paired with human-in-the-loop optimization to find single-joint, two-joint, and whole-leg assistance that maximally reduced the metabolic cost of walking for three participants. Hip-only and ankle-only assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 26% and 30% relative to walking in the device unassisted, confirming that both joints are good targets for assistance. Knee-only assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 13%, demonstrating that effective knee assistance is possible. Two-joint assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by between 34% and 42%, with the largest improvements coming from hip-ankle assistance. Assisting all three joints reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 50%, showing that at least half of the metabolic energy expended during walking can be saved through exoskeleton assistance. Changes in kinematics and muscle activity indicate that single-joint assistance indirectly assisted muscles at other joints, such that the improvement from whole-leg assistance was smaller than the sum of its single-joint parts. Exoskeletons can assist the entire limb for maximum effect, but a single well-chosen joint can be more efficient when considering additional factors such as weight and cost.",

    "abstract": "Some microorganisms can respire with extracellular electron acceptors using an extended electron transport chain to the cell surface. These organisms apply flavin molecules as cofactors to facilitate one-electron transfer catalysed by the terminal reductases and as endogenous electron shuttles. In the model organism Shewanella oneidensis, riboflavin production and excretion triggers a specific biofilm formation response that is initiated at a specific threshold concentration, similar to canonical quorum sensing molecules. Riboflavin-mediated messaging is based on the overexpression of the gene encoding the putrescin decarboxylase speC which leads to posttranscriptional overproduction of proteins involved in biofilm formation. Using a model of growth-dependent riboflavin production under batch and biofilm growth conditions, the number of cells necessary to produce the threshold concentration per time was deduced. Furthermore, our results indicate that specific retention of riboflavin in the biofilm matrix leads to localized concentrations which by far exceed the necessary threshold value.\n\nImportanceFerric iron is the fourth most abundant element of the earth crust. It occurs at neutral pH in the form insoluble iron minerals. The dissimilatory reduction of these minerals is an import part of global geological cycles and is catalyzed by microorganisms through extended respiratory chains to the cell surface. Shewanella oneidensis is one of the best understood model organisms for this kind of extracellular respiration. Flavins are important for the reduction of extracellular electron acceptors by S. oneidensis. since they have a function as (I) cofactors of the terminal reductases and (II) electron shuttles. In this study we reveal that flavin molecules are further employed as quorum sensing molecules. They are excreted by the organisms in a growth dependent manner and lead to anaerobic biofilm formation as a specific response at a certain threshold concentration. Although we know multiple examples of quorum sensing mechanisms, the use of riboflavin was so far not described and at least in S. oneidensis proceeds via a new regulatory routine that proceeds on the trancriptomic and posttranscriptomic level.",

    "abstract": "The microbiome plays key roles in host physiology and ecology, but how the microbiome varies among populations of hosts is not well understood. However, different abiotic and biotic selection pressures across a species range likely lead to variation in the microbiome. In addition, symbiotic microbiota may differ more between closely-related species in sympatry than in allopatry if selection favors the reduction of interspecific competition. We investigated variation in the maternally-transmitted, beneficial gut microbiomes of Phanaeus vindex and P. difformis, sister species of dung beetle that compete for the same resources in sympatry and occur across diverse climatic conditions. We sampled and sequenced bacterial/archaeal 16S rDNA from guts of P. difformis and P. vindex collected across 17 sympatric and allopatric sites. Gut microbial communities were best predicted by temperature and precipitation, cattle present at sites, and spatial relationships among sites. Contrary to our hypotheses, we did not find that the gut microbial communities of P. vindex and P. difformis differed more in sympatry than in allopatry, nor that P. vindex, the more broadly distributed of the two species, exhibited greater microbiome turnover among populations. However, the gut microbiome of P. vindex shifted more between sympatric and allopatric populations than did that of P. difformis, suggesting character displacement. While more research is needed, it is possible that differences in gut microbial communities allow P. vindex and P. difformis to partition their niches in sympatry. Our work argues for further exploration of the gut microbiomes potential role in niche partitioning and local adaptation.",

However, the protein functions of several highly injury-induced genes including Gpr151 for regulating the regenerative ability remain unclear. Here we present an alternative approach focused on non-coding functions of the coding genes, which led to the identification of the non-coding function of Gpr151 RNA interacting with RNA- binding proteins such as CSDE1. Gpr151 promotes axon regeneration by the function of its 5- untranslated region (5UTR) and expression of an engineered form of the 5UTR improves regenerative capacity in vitro and in vivo in both sciatic nerve and optic nerve injury models.

    "abstract": "The Notch signaling system links cellular fate to that of its neighbors, driving proliferation, apoptosis, and cell differentiation in metazoans, whereas dysfunction leads to debilitating developmental disorders and cancers. Other than a five-by-five domain complex, it is unclear how the 40 extracellular domains of the Notch1 receptor collectively engage the 19 domains of its canonical ligand Jagged1 to activate Notch1 signaling. Here, using cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), biophysical and structural techniques on the full extracellular complex and targeted sites,we identify five distinct regions, two on Notch1 and three on Jagged1, that form an interaction network.The Notch1 membrane-proximal regulatory region individually binds to the established Notch1 epidermal growth factor (EGF) 8-13 and Jagged1 C2-EGF3 activation sites, as well as to two additional Jagged1 regions, EGF 8-11 and cysteine-rich domain (CRD). XL-MS and quantitative interaction experiments show that the three Notch1 binding sites on Jagged1 also engage intramolecularly.These interactions, together with Notch1 and Jagged1 ectodomain dimensions and flexibility determined by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), support the formation of backfolded architectures. Combined, the data suggest that critical Notch1 and Jagged1 regions are not distal, but engage directly to control Notch1 signaling, thereby redefining the Notch1-Jagged1 activation mechanism and indicating new routes for therapeutic applications.",
