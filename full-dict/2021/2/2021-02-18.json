    "abstract": "The colonic epithelium is continuously exposed to an array of biological and mechanical stimuli as its luminal contents are guided over the epithelial surface through regulated smooth muscle contraction. In this report, the propulsion of solid fecal contents over the colonic epithelium is recapitulated through noninvasive actuation of magnetic agarose hydrogels over primary intestinal epithelial cultures, in contrast to the vast majority of platforms that apply shear forces through liquid microflow. Software-controlled magnetic stepper motors enable experimental control over the frequency and velocity of these events to match in vivo propulsive contractions, while the integration of standardized well plate spacing facilitates rapid integration into existing assay pipelines. The application of these solid-induced shear forces did not deleteriously affect cell monolayer surface coverage, viability, or transepithelial electrical resistance unless the device parameters were raised to a 50x greater contraction frequency and 4x greater fecal velocity than those observed in healthy humans. At a frequency and velocity that is consistent with average human colonic motility, differentiation of the epithelial cells into absorptive and goblet cell phenotypes was not affected. Protein secretion was modulated with a two-fold increase in luminal mucin-2 secretion and a significant reduction in basal interleukin-8 secretion. F-actin, zonula occludens-1, and E-cadherin were each present in their proper basolateral locations, similar to those of static control cultures. While cellular height was unaffected by magnetic agarose propulsion, several alterations in lateral morphology were observed including decreased circularity and compactness, and an increase in major axis length, which align with surface epithelial cell morphologies observed in vivo and may represent early markers of luminal exfoliation. This platform will be of widespread utility for the investigation of fecal propulsive forces on intestinal physiology, shedding light on how the colonic epithelium responds to mechanical cues.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIMagnetic nanoparticle-embedded agarose hydrogels were developed as surrogates for human feces\nC_LIO_LISoftware-controlled magnetic motors enable programmable studies of colonic motility\nC_LIO_LIPropulsive shear forces were optimized for primary cell viability, surface coverage, and electrical resistance\nC_LIO_LIMucus production and cytokine secretion were modulated by magnetic agarose propulsion\nC_LIO_LIStructural and cytoskeletal proteins remain properly distributed with alterations in lateral cell morphology\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) often detect a large number of differentially methylated sites or regions, many are located in distal regulatory regions. To further prioritize these significant sites, there is a critical need to better understand the functional impact of CpG methylation. Recent studies demonstrated CpG methylation-dependent transcriptional regulation is a widespread phenomenon. Here we present MethReg, an R/Bioconductor package that analyzes matched DNA-methylation and gene-expression data, along with external transcription factor (TF) binding information, to evaluate, prioritize, and annotate CpG sites with high regulatory potential. By simultaneous modeling three key elements that contribute to gene transcription (CpG methylation, target gene expression and TF activity), MethReg identifies TF-target gene associations that are present only in a subset of samples with high (or low) methylation levels at the CpG that influences TF activities, which can be missed in analyses that use all samples. Using real colorectal cancer and Alzheimers disease datasets, we show MethReg significantly enhances our understanding of the regulatory roles of DNA methylation in complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "The interfacial tension of phase-separated biomolecular condensates affects their fusion and multiphase organization, and yet how this important property depends on the composition and interactions of the constituent macromolecules is poorly understood. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to determine the interfacial tension and phase equilibrium of model condensate-forming systems. The model systems consist of binary mixtures of Lennard-Jones particles or chains of such particles. We refer to the two components as drivers and regulators; the former has stronger self-interactions and hence a higher critical temperature (Tc) for phase separation. In previous work, we have shown that, depending on the relative strengths of driver-regulator interactions and driver-driver interactions, regulators can either promote or suppress phase separation (i.e., increase or decrease Tc). Here we find that the effects of regulators on Tc quantitatively match the effects on interfacial tension ({gamma}). This important finding means that, when a condensate-forming system experiences a change in macromolecular composition or a change in intermolecular interactions (e.g., by mutation or posttranslational modification, or by variation in solvent conditions such as temperature, pH, or salt), the resulting change in Tc can be used to predict the change in{gamma} and vice versa. We also report initial results showing that disparity in intermolecular interactions drives multiphase coexistence. These findings provide much needed guidance for understanding how biomolecular condensates mediate cellular functions.",

    "abstract": "Degradation of water optical properties due to anthropogenic disturbances is a common phenomenon in coastal waters globally. Although this condition is associated with multiple drivers that affect corals health in multiple ways, its effect on light availability and photosynthetic energy acquisition has been largely neglected. Here, we describe how declining the water optical quality in a coastal reef exposed to a turbid plume of water originating from a man-made channel compromise the functionality of the keystone coral species Orbicella faveolata. We found highly variable water optical conditions with significant effects on the light quantity and quality available for corals. Reduction of light penetration into the water column elicits the development of low-light phenotypes close to theoretical limits of photoacclimation despite their occurrence at shallow depths. Predicted photosynthetic energy depletion with increasing depth is associated with patterns of colony mortality and contraction of the habitable space for the population. A numerical model illustrates the potential effect the progressive degradation of water optical properties on the gradual mortality and population decline of O. faveolata. Our findings suggest that preserving the water optical properties seeking to maximize light penetration into the water column may have an extraordinary impact on coral reefs conservation, mostly toward the deeper portions of reefs.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) is required for movement, sleep, and reward, and DA signaling is tightly controlled by the presynaptic DA transporter (DAT). Therapeutic and addictive psychostimulants, including methylphenidate (Ritalin; MPH), cocaine, and amphetamine (AMPH), markedly elevate extracellular DA via their actions as competitive DAT inhibitors (MPH, cocaine) and substrates (AMPH). DAT silencing in mice and invertebrates results in hyperactivity, reduced sleep, and blunted psychostimulant responses, highlighting DATs essential role in DA-dependent behaviors. DAT surface expression is not static; rather it is dynamically regulated by endocytic trafficking. PKC-stimulated DAT endocytosis requires the neuronal GTPase, Rit2, and Rit2 silencing in mouse DA neurons impacts psychostimulant sensitivity. However, it is unknown whether or not Rit2-mediated changes in psychostimulant sensitivity are DAT-dependent. Here, we leveraged Drosophila melanogaster to test whether the Drosophila Rit2 ortholog, Ric, impacts dDAT function, trafficking, and DA-dependent behaviors. Orthologous to hDAT and Rit2, dDAT and Ric directly interact, and the constitutively active Ric mutant Q117L increased dDAT surface levels and function in cell lines and ex vivo Drosophila brains. Moreover, DAergic RicQ117L expression caused sleep fragmentation in a DAT-dependent manner but had no effect on total sleep and daily locomotor activity. Importantly, we found that Rit2 is required for AMPH-stimulated DAT internalization in mouse striatum, and that DAergic RicQ117L expression significantly increased Drosophila AMPH sensitivity in a DAT-dependent manner, suggesting a conserved impact of Ric-dependent DAT trafficking on AMPH sensitivity. These studies support that the DAT/Rit2 interaction impacts both baseline behaviors and AMPH sensitivity, potentially by regulating DAT trafficking.",

    "abstract": "The burst coding hypothesis posits that the occurrence of sudden high-frequency patterns of action potentials constitutes a salient syllable of the neural code. Many neurons, however, do not produce clearly demarcated bursts, an observation invoked to rule out the pervasiveness of this coding scheme across brain areas and cell types. Here we ask how identifiable spike-timing patterns have to be to preserve potent transmission of information. Should we expect that neurons avoid ambiguous patterns that are neither clearly bursts nor isolated spikes? We addressed these questions using information theory and computational simulations. By quantifying how information transmission depends on firing statistics, we found that the information transmitted is not strongly influenced by the presence of clearly demarcated modes in the interspike interval distribution, a feature often used to identify the presence of burst coding. Instead, we found that neurons having unimodal interval distributions were still able to ascribe different meanings to bursts and isolated spikes. In this regime, information transmission depends on properties of the synapses as well as the length and relative frequency of bursts. Furthermore, we found that common metrics used to quantify burstiness were also unable to predict the degree with which bursts could be used to carry information. Our results provide guiding principles for the implementation of coding strategies based on spike-timing patterns, and show that even unimodal firing statistics can be consistent with a bivariate neural code.",

    "abstract": "Cortical excitability, the variable response to a given cortical input, is widely studied in neuroscience, from slice experiments and in silico modeling work to human clinical settings. However, a unifying definition and a translational approach to the phenomenon are currently lacking. For example, at the onset of epileptic seizures, cortical excitability may impair resilience to perturbations (external or endogenous). In this study, we tested in vivo whether changes in cortical excitability quantified as evoked response to small perturbation corresponded to changes in resilience to larger perturbations. To do so, we used both cell-type circuit specific optogenetic stimulation in mice and direct intracranial stimulation in one human subject and quantified 1) evoked cortical responses to single pulses of varying intensity, and 2) evoked cortical facilitation and suppression to paired pulses at varying intervals. In the presence of a gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist or antagonist, we found that 1) cortical response to single pulses and 2) cortical facilitation decreased and increased, respectively. Additionally, using trains of opto-pulses in mice in the presence of a GABA agonist, we found increased resilience to the induction of seizures. With this study, we provide evidence for a tight correlation between cortical excitability and resilience, exploring a range of cortical dynamics, from physiological excitability, to pathological discharges. Our study carried out with two different stimulation methods in two species suggests that varying cortical excitability can be tracked with simple protocols involving minute short-lived perturbative stimuli.",

YAP and TAZ directly interact with JUNB and STAT3 via a WW domain important for transformation, co-occupy many target sites in vivo via AP-1 and (to a lesser extent) STAT3 sequence motifs, and stimulate transcriptional activation by AP-1 proteins. A few target sites are YAP- or TAZ-specific, and they are associated with different sequence motifs and gene classes. YAP/TAZ, JUNB, and STAT3 directly regulate a common set of target genes that overlap, but are distinct from, those regulated by YAP/TAZ and TEADs. The set of genes regulated by YAP/TAZ, STAT3, and JUNB is associated with poor survival in breast cancer patients with the triple-negative form of the disease.",

While the notion that spontaneous DNA damage at telomeres is required for ALT to occur, the molecular triggers of this physiological telomere instability are largely unknown. We previously proposed that the telomeric long noncoding RNA TERRA may represent one such trigger; however, given the lack of tools to suppress TERRA transcription in cells, our hypothesis remained speculative. We have now developed Transcription Activator-Like Effectors able to rapidly inhibit TERRA transcription from multiple chromosome ends in an ALT cell line. TERRA transcription inhibition decreases marks of DNA replication stress and DNA damage at telomeres and impairs ALT activity and telomere length maintenance. We conclude that TERRA transcription actively destabilizes telomere integrity in ALT cells, thereby initiating BIR and supporting telomere elongation. Our data point to TERRA transcription manipulation as a potentially useful target for therapy.",

As with other aspects of sound processing, sensitivity to such patterns may change with age, and may help explain some age-related changes in hearing such as segregating speech from background sound. We recorded magnetoencephalography to characterize differences in the processing of sound patterns between younger and older adults. We presented tone sequences that either contained a pattern (made of a repeated set of tones) or did not contain a pattern. We show that auditory cortex in older, compared to younger, adults is hyperresponsive to sound onsets, but that sustained neural activity in auditory cortex, indexing the processing of a sound pattern, is reduced. Hence, the sensitivity of neural populations in auditory cortex fundamentally differs between younger and older individuals, overresponding to sound onsets, while underresponding to patterns in sounds. This may help to explain some age-related changes in hearing such as increased sensitivity to distracting sounds and difficulties tracking speech in the presence of other sound.",

Further, we show that itch-activated CeA neurons play important roles in itch-related comorbidities, including anxiety-like behaviors, but not in some aversive and appetitive behaviors previously ascribed to CeA neurons. RNA-sequencing of itch-activated CeA neurons identified several differentially expressed genes as well as potential key signaling pathways in regulating pruritis. Finally, viral tracing experiments demonstrate that these neurons send a critical projection to the periaqueductal gray to mediate modulation of itch. These findings reveal a cellular and circuit signature of CeA neurons orchestrating behavioral and affective responses to pruritus in mice.",

While the T cell response to BCG vaccination has been well-characterised, little is known about the B cell and antibody response. We demonstrate BCG vaccine-mediated induction of specific antibodies in different human populations and macaque species which represent important preclinical models for TB vaccine development. We observe a strong correlation between antibody titres in serum versus plasma with modestly higher titres in serum. We also report for the first time the rapid and transient induction of antibody-secreting plasmablasts following BCG vaccination, together with a robust and durable memory B cell response in humans. Finally, we demonstrate a potential contribution of the antibody response to BCG vaccine-mediated control of mycobacterial growth in vitro. Taken together, our findings indicate that the humoral immune response in the context of BCG vaccination merits further attention to determine whether TB vaccine candidates could benefit from the induction of humoral as well as cellular immunity.",

To assess the functional capacity of such eyes we have developed modelling principles based on ray tracing in 3D reconstructions of eye morphology, were refraction on the way to the photoreceptors and absorption in the photopigment are calculated incrementally for ray bundles from all angles withing the visual field. From the ray tracing, we calculate the complete angular acceptance function of each photoreceptor in the eye, revealing the visual acuity for all parts of the visual field. We then use this information to generate visual filters that can be applied to high resolution images or videos to convert them to accurate representations of the spatial information seen by the animal. The method is here applied to the 0.1 mm eyes of the velvet worm Euperipatoides rowelli (Onychophora). These eyes of these terrestrial invertebrates consist of a curved cornea covering an irregular but optically homogeneous lens directly joining a retina packed with photoreceptive rhabdomeres. 3D reconstruction from histological sections revealed an asymmetric eye, where the retina is deeper in the forward-pointing direction. The calculated visual acuity also reveals performance differences across the visual field, with a maximum acuity of about 0.11 cycles/deg in the forward direction despite laterally pointing eyes. The results agree with previous behavioural measurements of visual acuity, and suggest that velvet worm vision is adequate for orientation and positioning within the habitat.\n\nAuthor summaryIt is difficult to understand the roles that vision may have in animals with visual performance very different to our own. Many invertebrates such as flatworms, polychaetes, onychophorans, gastropod molluscs and numerous arthropods have tiny eyes with unknown visual abilities. At best, behavioural experiments can reveal visual performance limits for specific behaviours but they will not give general information about what is visible to the animal, which is crucial for understanding the roles vision may have. Here we use ray tracing applied to accurate anatomical/optical models of the eyes of a velvet worm to reconstruct the visual acuity in all parts of the visual field. We also use the calculated visual performance to closely simulate what animals would see in their natural habitat. The method can be applied to any (preferably small) eye and offers an alternative strategy that may yield information about the visual capacity that is otherwise hard to obtain.",

We show that in one such model, and in simple spatial memory tasks we have given to human subjects, short-term memory can be limited to similar low capacity by interference effects, in tasks terminated by errors, and can exhibit similar sublinear scaling, when errors are overlooked. The same mechanism can drive serial recall if combined with weak order-encoding plasticity. Finally, even when storing randomly correlated patterns of activity the network demonstrates correlation-driven latching waves, which are reflected at the outer extremes of pattern space.",

    "abstract": "Considerable controversy exists about which hypotheses and variables best explain mammalian brain size variation. We use a new, high-coverage dataset of marsupial brain and body sizes, and the first phylogenetically imputed full datasets of 16 predictor variables, to model the prevalent hypotheses explaining brain size evolution using phylogenetically corrected Bayesian generalised linear mixed-effects modelling. Despite this comprehensive analysis, litter size emerges as the only significant predictor. Marsupials differ from the more frequently studied placentals in displaying much lower diversity of reproductive traits, which are known to interact extensively with many behavioural and ecological predictors of brain size. Our results therefore suggest that studies of relative brain size evolution in placental mammals may require targeted co-analysis or adjustment of reproductive parameters like litter size, weaning age, or gestation length. This supports suggestions that significant associations between behavioural or ecological variables with relative brain size may be due to a confounding influence of the extensive reproductive diversity of placental mammals.",

The uncertainty of rDNA genomic structure presents a significant barrier for studying their function and evolution. Here, we generate ultra-long Nanopore and short NGS reads to delineate the architecture and variation of the 5S rDNA cluster in the different strains of C. elegans and C. briggsae. We classify the individual rDNA units into 25 types based on the unique sequence variations in each unit of C. elegans (N2). We next perform manual assembly of the cluster using the long reads that carry these units, which led to an assembly of rDNA cluster consisting of up to 167 5S rDNA units. The ordering and copy number of various rDNA units are indicative of separation time between strains. Surprisingly, we observed a drastically lower level of variation in the 5S rDNA cluster in the C. elegans CB4856 and C. briggsae AF16 strains than C. elegans N2 strain, suggesting a unique mechanism in maintaining the rDNA cluster stability in the N2. Single-copy transgenes landed into the rDNA cluster shows the expected expression in the soma, supporting that rDNA genomic environment is transcriptionally compatible with RNA polymerase II. Delineating the structure and variation of rDNA cluster paves the way for its functional and evolutionary studies.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has highlighted roles for thermodynamic phase behavior in diverse cellular processes. Proteins and nucleic acids can phase separate into three-dimensional liquid droplets in the cytoplasm and nucleus and the plasma membrane of animal cells appears tuned close to a two-dimensional liquid-liquid critical point. In some examples, cytoplasmic proteins aggregate at plasma membrane domains, forming structures such as the post-synaptic density and diverse signaling clusters. Here we examine the physics of these surface densities, employing minimal simulations of co-acervating polymers coupled to an Ising membrane surface in conjunction with a complementary Landau theory. We argue that these surface densities are a novel phase reminiscent of pre-wetting, in which a molecularly thin three-dimensional liquid forms on a usually solid surface. However, in surface densities the solid surface is replaced by a membrane with an independent propensity to phase separate. We show that proximity to criticality in the membrane dramatically increases the parameter regime in which a pre-wetting-like transition occurs, leading to a broad region where coexisting surface phases can form even when a bulk phase is unstable. Our simulations naturally exhibit three surface phase coexistence even though both the membrane and the polymer bulk can only display two phase coexistence on their own. We argue that the physics of these surface densities enables diverse functions seen in Eukaryotic cells.",

Considering that neurodegenerative changes are not reversible, understanding early functional changes before neurodegeneration is critical to develop new strategies for early detection and treatment of AD. We found that Tg2576 mice exhibited impaired pattern separation at the early preclinical stage. Based on previous studies suggesting a critical role of dentate gyrus (DG) in pattern separation, we investigated functional changes in DG of Tg2576 mice. We found that granule cells in DG (DG-GCs) in Tg2576 mice showed increased action potential firing in response to long depolarizations and reduced 4-AP sensitive K+-currents compared to DG-GCs in wild-type (WT) mice. Among Kv4 family channels, Kv4.1 mRNA expression in DG was significantly lower in Tg2576 mice. We confirmed that Kv4.1 protein expression was reduced in Tg2576, and this reduction was restored by antioxidant treatment. Hyperexcitable DG and impaired pattern separation in Tg2576 mice were also recovered by antioxidant treatment. These results highlight the hyperexcitability of DG-GCs as a pathophysiologic mechanism underlying early cognitive deficits in AD and Kv4.1 as a new target for AD pathogenesis in relation to increased oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Himalaya-Tibet orogen (HTO) presents an outstanding geologically active formation that contributed to, and fostered, modern Asian biodiversity. However, our concepts of the historical biogeography of its biota are far from conclusive, as are uplift scenarios for the different parts of the HTO. Here, we revisited our previously published data set of the tribe Paini extending it with sequence data from the most western Himalayan spiny frogs Allopaa and Chrysopaa and using them as an indirect indicator for the paleoecological development of Tibet.\n\nMethodsWe obtained sequence data of two mitochondrial loci (16S rRNA, COI) and one nuclear marker (Rag1) from Allopaa samples from Kashmir Himalaya as well as Chrysopaa sequence data from the Hindu Kush available from GenBank to complement our previous data set. A Maximum likelihood and dated Bayesian gene tree were generated based on the concatenated data set. To resolve the inconsistent placement of Allopaa, we performed different topology tests.\n\nResultsConsistent with previous results, the Southeast Asian genus Quasipaa is sister to all other spiny frogs. The results further reveal a basal placement of Chrysopaa relative to Allopaa and Nanorana with an estimated age of ca. 26 Mya. Based on the topology tests, the phylogenetic position of Allopaa as a sister clade to Chaparana seems to be most likely, resulting in a paraphyletic genus Nanorana and a separation from the latter clade around 20 Mya. Both, the placements of Chrysopaa and Allopaa support the presence of basal Paini lineages in the far north western part of the HTO, which is diametrically opposite end of the HTO with respect to the ancestral area of spiny frogs in Southeast Asia. These striking distributional patterns can be most parsimoniously explained by trans-Tibet dispersal during the late Oligocene (subtropical Chrysopaa) respectively early Miocene (warm temperate Allopaa). Within spiny frogs, only members of the monophyletic Nanorana+Paa clade are adapted to the colder temperate climates, indicating that high-altitude environments did not dominate in the HTO before ca. 15 Mya. Our results are consistent with fossil records suggesting that large parts of Tibet were characterized by subtropical to warm temperate climates at least until the early Miocene.",

Polarization of macrophages into fungal-inhibiting M1 and fungal-promoting M2 types has been shown to play an important role in the innate immune response against fungal pathogens. This mechanism has not been defined for T. marneffei. Here, we demonstrated that T. marneffei promotes its survival in human macrophages by inducing them towards M2 polarization. Our investigations of the mechanism revealed that T. marneffei infection led to SOCS3 protein degradation by inducing tyrosine phosphorylation, thereby relieving the inhibitory effect of SOCS3 on p-STAT6, a key factor for M2 polarization. Our SOCS3-overexpression experiments showed that SOCS3 is a positive regulator of M1 polarization and plays an important role in limiting M2 polarization. Furthermore, we found that inhibition of TLR9 pathway partially blocked T. marneffei-induced M2 polarization and significantly enhanced the killing activity of macrophages against T. marneffei. Collectively, these results reveal a novel mechanism by which T. marneffei evades the immune response of human macrophages.",

    "abstract": "Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are ligand-gated pentameric chloride channels in the central nervous system. GlyR-3 is a possible target for chronic pain treatment and temporal lobe epilepsy. Alternative splicing into K or L variants determines the subcellular fate and function of GlyR-3, yet it remains to be shown whether its different splice variants can functionally co-assemble, and what the properties of such heteropentamers would be. Here, we subjected GlyR-3 to a combined fluorescence microscopy and electrophysiology analysis. We employ masked Pearsons and dual-color spatiotemporal correlation analysis to prove that GlyR-3 splice variants heteropentamerize, adopting the mobility of the K variant. Fluorescence-based single-subunit counting experiments revealed a variable and concentration ratio dependent hetero-stoichiometry. Via single-channel on-cell patch clamp we show heteropentameric conductances resemble those of the 3K splice variant. Our data are compatible with a model where 3 heteropentamerization fine-tunes mobility and activity of GlyR 3 channels, which is important to understand and tackle 3 related diseases.\n\nSummaryThe glycine receptor 3 is key to the central nervous systems physiology and involved in chronic pain and epilepsy.

    "abstract": "Background and ObjectivesUse of psychotropic substances in childhood has been associated with both impulsivity and other manifestations of poor executive function as well as escalation over time to use of progressively stronger substances. However, how this relationship may start in earlier childhood has not been well explored. Here, we investigated the neurobehavioral correlates of daily caffeinated soda consumption in preadolescent children and examined whether caffeinated soda intake is associated with a higher risk of subsequent alcohol initiation.\n\nMethodsUsing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study data, we first investigated cross-sectional relationships between frequent caffeinated soda intake and well-known risk factors of substance misuse: impaired working memory, high impulsivity, and aberrant reward processing. We then examined whether caffeinated soda intake at baseline predicts more alcohol sipping at 12 months follow-up using a machine learning algorithm.\n\nResultsDaily consumption of caffeinated soda was cross-sectionally associated with neurobehavioral risk factors for substance misuse such as higher impulsivity scores and lower working memory performance. Furthermore, caffeinated soda intake predicted greater alcohol sipping after 12 months even after controlling for rates of baseline alcohol sipping; children who drink caffeinated soda daily are twice as likely to start sipping alcohol after one year compared to those who do not drink caffeinated soda at all.\n\nConclusionsThese findings suggest that previous linkages between caffeine and substance use in adolescence also extend to younger initiation, and may stem from core neurocognitive features thought conducive to substance initiation.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian neocortex is important for conscious processing of sensory information. Fundamental to this function is balanced glutamatergic and GABAergic signalling. Yet little is known about how this interaction arises in the developing forebrain despite increasing insight into early GABAergic interneuron (IN) circuits. To further study this, we assessed the contribution of specific INs to the development of sensory processing in the mouse whisker barrel cortex. Specifically we explored the role of INs in speed coding and sensory adaptation. In wild-type animals, both speed processing and adaptation were present as early as the layer 4 critical period of plasticity, and showed refinement over the period leading to active whisking onset. We then conditionally silenced action-potential-dependent GABA release in either somatostatin (SST) or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) INs. These genetic manipulations influenced both spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity in an age and layer-dependent manner. Silencing SST+ INs reduced early spontaneous activity and abolished facilitation in sensory adaptation observed in control pups. In contrast, VIP+ IN silencing had an effect towards the onset of active whisking. Silencing either IN subtype had no effect on speed coding. Our results reveal how these IN subtypes differentially contribute to early sensory processing over the first few postnatal weeks.",

    "abstract": "Life history traits underlie the fitness of organisms and are under strong natural selection in the face of environmental challenges. A new mutation that positively impacts a life history trait will likely increase in frequency and become fixed in a population (e.g. selective sweep). The identification of the beneficial alleles that underlie selective sweeps provides insights into the mechanisms that occurred during the evolution of species. In the global population of Caenorhabditis elegans, we previously identified selective sweeps that have drastically reduced chromosomal-scale genetic diversity in the species. Here, we measured the fertility (viable offspring) of a collection of wild C. elegans strains, including many recently isolated divergent strains from the Hawaiian islands and found that strains with larger swept genomic regions on multiple chromosomes have significantly higher fertility than strains that do not have evidence of the recent selective sweeps. We used genome-wide association (GWA) mapping to identify three quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying the fertility variation. Additionally, we mapped previous fertility data of wild C. elegans strains and C. elegans recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines (RIAILs) that were grown in various conditions and detected eight QTL across the genome using GWA and linkage mappings. These QTL show the genetic complexity of life history traits such as fertility across this species. Moreover, the haplotype structure in each GWA QTL region revealed correlations with recent selective sweeps in the C. elegans population. North American and European strains had significantly higher fertility than most strains from Hawaii, a hypothesized origin of the C. elegans species, suggesting that beneficial alleles that cause increased fertility could underlie the selective sweeps during the worldwide expansion of C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "Canonical retrograde signalling comprises information transmission from organelles to the nucleus and in particular controls gene expression for organellar proteins. The need to re-assess this paradigm was suggested by discrepancies between de novo protein synthesis and transcript abundance in response to excess light. Here we uncover major components of a translation-dependent retrograde signalling pathway that first impacts translation and then transcription. The response realization depends on the kinases Mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MPK6) and Sucrose non-fermenting 1-related kinase (SnRK1) subunit, AKIN10. Global ribosome foot-printing revealed differential ribosome association of 951 transcripts within 10 min after transfer from low to high light. Despite predominant translational repression, 15 % of transcripts were increased in translation and enriched for chloroplast-localized photosynthetic proteins. About one third of these transcripts, including Stress associated proteins (SAP) 2 and 3, share regulatory motifs in their 5'-UTR that act as binding sites for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPC) and light responsive RNA binding proteins (RBPs). SAP2 and 3 are both translationally regulated and interact with the calcium sensor Calmodulin-like 49 (CML49), which promotes relocation to the nucleus inducing a translation-dependent nuclear stress response. Thus, translation-dependent retrograde signalling bifurcates to directly regulate a translational circuit of chloroplast proteins and simultaneously initiate a nuclear circuit synchronizing retrograde and anterograde response pathways, serving as a rapid mechanism for functional acclimation of the chloroplast.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe increasing amount of data points to the circadian timing system as an essential part of processes regulating androgen homeostasis. However, the relationship between stress response, timekeeping-, and steroidogenesis-related systems is unexplored.\n\nObjectiveThe purpose of the study was to analyze the stress-response of the testosterone-producing Leydig cells depending on the stressful events time.\n\nMaterials and methodsThe study was designed to follow the effects of 3-hour immobilization (IMO) applied at different periods during the day. The IMO performed once (1xIMO) or repeated in 10 consecutive days (10xIMO). Principal-component-analysis (PCA) followed the expression study of the clock and steroidogenic-related genes in Leydig cells.\n\nResultsBoth types of IMO in all investigated periods increased corticosterone and decreased testosterone blood level. Transcriptional analysis revealed different sensitivity to IMO events depending on the circadian time. The majority of steroidogenesis-related genes (Lhcgr, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, Hsd3b1/2) were down-regulated in the inactive but unchanged or even up-regulated in the active phase of the day. Both types of IMO potentiated the expression of clock elements Bmal1/BMAL1, Per1/PER1 regardless of the days stage and reduced Reverba in the inactive phase. The PCA confirmed a major shift, for both IMO-types, in the transcription of steroidogenesis and clock genes across the inactive/active phase. Further, the diurnal pattern of the glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1/GR) expression in Leydig cells was increased in the inactive phase due to 10xIMO. The observed time-dependent IMO-response of the Leydig cells correlated with different GR engagements.\n\nDiscussionStress- and the circadian-system coordinatively shape Leydig cells physiology, assuming diverse GR engagement as a possible factor in mediating the diurnal effect of stress.\n\nConclusionThe Leydig cells stress-response depends on the time of the stressful situation, emphasizing the importance of circadian activity in supporting androgen homeostasis and male fertility.",

    "abstract": "While our battle with the COVID-19 pandemic continues, a multitude of Omics data has been generated from patient samples in various studies, which remains to be translated. We conducted a meta-analysis of published transcriptome and proteome profiles of nasal swab and bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples of COVID-19 patients, to shortlist high confidence upregulated host factors. Subsequently, mRNA overexpression of selected genes was validated in nasal swab/BALF samples from a cohort of COVID-19 positive/negative, symptomatic/asymptomatic individuals. Analysis of these data revealed S100 family genes (S100A6, S100A8, S100A9, and S100P) as prognostic markers of COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, Thioredoxin gene (TXN) was identified as a significant upregulated host factor in our overlap analysis. An FDA-approved drug Auranofin, which inhibits Thioredoxin reduction, was found to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and in vivo in the hamster challenge model. Overall, this study translates COVID-19 host response Big Data into potential clinical interventions.",

    "abstract": "The tumor stroma and its cellular components are known to play an important role in tumor resilience towards treatment. Here, we report a novel resistance mechanism in melanoma that is elicited by BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi)-induced non-canonical nuclear {beta}-catenin signaling in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Our study reveals that BRAFi leads to an expanded CAF population with increased {beta}-catenin nuclear accumulation and enhances their biological properties. This CAF subpopulation is essential for melanoma cells to grow and resist to BRAFi/MEK inhibitors (MEKi). Mechanistically, BRAFi induces BRAF and CRAF dimerization and subsequently the activation of ERK signaling in CAFs, leading to the inactivation of the {beta}-catenin destruction complex. By RNA-Seq, periostin (POSTN) is identified as a major downstream effector of {beta} catenin in CAFs and can compensate for the loss of {beta}-catenin in CAFs in conferring melanoma cell BRAFi/MEKi resistance. Moreover, POSTN reactivates the ERK pathway, which is inhibited by BRAFi/MEKi, in melanoma cells through PI3K/AKT signaling. Our data underscore the roles of BRAFi-induced CAF reprogramming in matrix remodeling and therapeutic escape of melanoma cells and reveal POSTN as an important matrix target to eliminate BRAFi/MEKi resistance in melanoma.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic adaptation to changing demands underlies homeostasis. During inflammation or metastasis, cells leading migration into challenging environments require an energy boost, however what controls this capacity is unknown. We identify a previously unstudied nuclear protein, Atossa, as changing metabolism in Drosophila melanogaster immune cells to promote tissue invasion. Atossas vertebrate orthologs, FAM214A-B, can fully substitute for Atossa, indicating functional conservation from flies to mammals. Atossa increases mRNA levels of Porthos, an unstudied RNA helicase and two metabolic enzymes, LKR/SDH and GR/HPR. Porthos increases translation of a gene subset, including those affecting mitochondrial functions, the electron transport chain, and metabolism. Respiration measurements and metabolomics indicate that Atossa and Porthos powers up mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to produce sufficient energy for leading macrophages to forge a path into tissues. As increasing oxidative phosphorylation enables many crucial physiological responses, this unique genetic program may modulate a wide range of cellular behaviors beyond migration.",

    "abstract": "The G matrix, which quantifies the genetic architecture of traits, is often viewed as an evolutionary constraint. However, G can evolve in response to selection and may also be viewed as a product of adaptive evolution. Convergent evolution of G in similar environments would suggest that G evolves adaptively, but it is difficult to disentangle such effects from phylogeny. Here, we use the adaptive radiation of Anolis lizards to ask whether convergence of G accompanies the repeated evolution of habitat specialists, or ecomorphs, across the Greater Antilles. We measured G in seven species representing three ecomorphs (trunk-crown, trunk- ground, and grass-bush). We found that the overall structure of G does not converge. Instead, the structure of G is well conserved and displays a phylogenetic signal consistent with Brownian motion. However, several elements of G showed signatures of convergence, indicating that some aspects of genetic architecture have been shaped by selection. Most notably, genetic correlations between limb traits and body traits were weaker in long-legged trunk-ground species, suggesting effects of recurrent selection on limb length. Our results demonstrate that common selection pressures may have subtle but consistent effects on the evolution of G, even as its overall structure remains conserved.",

    "abstract": "Early Endosomal Antigen 1 (EEA1) is a key protein in endosomal trafficking and is implicated in both autoimmune and neurological diseases. The C-terminal FYVE domain of EEA1 binds endosomal membranes, which contain phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P). Although it is known that FYVE binds PI(3)P specifically, it has not previously been described of how FYVE attaches and binds to endosomal membranes. In this study, we employed both coarse-grained (CG) and atomistic (AT) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine how FYVE binds to PI(3)P-containing membranes. CG-MD showed that the dominant membrane binding mode resembles the crystal structure of EEA1 FYVE domain in complex with inositol-1,3-diphospate (PDB ID 1JOC). FYVE, which is a homodimer, binds the membrane via a hinge mechanism, where the C-terminus of one monomer first attaches to the membrane, followed by the C-terminus of the other monomer. The total binding energy is 70 kJ/mol, of which 50-60 kJ/mol stems from specific PI(3)P-interactions. By AT-MD, we could partition the binding mode into two types: (i) adhesion by electrostatic FYVE-PI(3)P interaction, and (ii) insertion of amphipathic loops. The AT simulations also demonstrated flexibility within the FYVE homodimer between the C-terminal heads and coiled-coil stem, allowing binding via a mechanism resembling that of a suction cup connected to a locally rigid stem via a flexible hinge.",
