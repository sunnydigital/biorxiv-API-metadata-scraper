    "abstract": "Allosteric modulators provide therapeutic advantages over orthosteric drugs. A plethora of allosteric modulators have been identified for several GPCRs, particularly for muscarinic receptors (mAChRs)1,2. To study the molecular mechanisms governing allosteric modulation, we utilized a recently developed NMR system to investigate the conformational changes in the M2 muscarinic receptor (M2R) in response to the positive allosteric modulator (PAM) LY2119620. Our studies provide the first biophysical data showing that LY2119620 can substantially change the structure and dynamics of M2R in both the extracellular and G-protein coupling domains during the activation process. These NMR data suggest that LY2119620 may function by stabilizing distinct sets of conformations not observed in the presence of orthosteric agonists alone, which may account for the different signaling behaviors of the M2R when bound to LY2119620. Our studies provide new structural information for understanding the mechanism of GPCR allostery, and may facilitate the rational design of allosteric therapeutics targeting muscarinic receptors.",

    "abstract": "In cancer, copy number aberrations (CNA) represent a type of nearly ubiquitous and frequently extensive structural genome variations. To disentangle the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis as well as identify and characterize molecular subtypes, the comparative and meta-analysis of large genomic variant collections can be of immense importance. Over the last decades, cancer genomic profiling projects have resulted in a large amount of somatic genome variation profiles, however segregated in a multitude of individual studies and datasets. The Progenetix project, initiated in 2001, curates individual cancer CNA profiles and associated metadata from published oncogenomic studies and data repositories with the aim to empower integrative analyses spanning all different cancer biologies.\n\nDuring the last few years, the fields of genomics and cancer research have seen significant advancement in terms of molecular genetics technology, disease concepts, data standard harmonization as well as data availability, in an increasingly structured and systematic manner. For the Progenetix resource, continuous data integration, curation and maintenance have resulted in the most comprehensive representation of cancer genome CNA profiling data with 138663 (including 115357 tumor) CNV profiles. In this article, we report a 4.5-fold increase in sample number since 2013, improvements in data quality, ontology representation with a CNV landscape summary over 51 distinctive NCIt cancer terms as well as updates in database schemas, and data access including new web front-end and programmatic data access.

    "abstract": "Genes in SARS-CoV-2 and, more generally, in viruses in the order of Nidovirales are expressed by a process of discontinuous transcription mediated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This process is distinct from alternative splicing in eukaryotes, rendering current transcript assembly methods unsuitable to Nidovirales sequencing samples. Here, we introduce the DO_SCPLOWISCONTINUOUSC_SCPLOW TO_SCPLOWRANSCRIPTC_SCPLOW AO_SCPLOWSSEMBLYC_SCPLOW problem of finding transcripts [Formula] and their abundances c given an alignment [Formula] under a maximum likelihood model that accounts for varying transcript lengths. Underpinning our approach is the concept of a segment graph, a directed acyclic graph that, distinct from the splice graph used to characterize alternative splicing, has a unique Hamiltonian path. We provide a compact characterization of solutions as subsets of non-overlapping edges in this graph, enabling the formulation of an efficient mixed integer linear program. We show using simulations that our method, JO_SCPLOWUMPERC_SCPLOW, drastically outperforms existing methods for classical transcript assembly. On short-read data of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 samples, we find that JO_SCPLOWUMPERC_SCPLOW not only identifies canonical transcripts that are part of the reference transcriptome, but also predicts expression of non-canonical transcripts that are well supported by direct evidence from long-read data, presence in multiple, independent samples or a conserved core sequence. JO_SCPLOWUMPERC_SCPLOW enables detailed analyses of Nidovirales transcriptomes.\n\nCode availabilitySoftware is available at https://github.com/elkebir-group/Jumper",

    "abstract": "Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are emerging as a promising class of therapeutics for neurological diseases. When injected directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, ASOs distribute broadly across brain regions and exert long-lasting therapeutic effects. However, many phosphorothioate (PS)-modified gapmer ASOs show transient motor phenotypes when injected into the cerebrospinal fluid, ranging from reduced motor activity to ataxia or acute seizure-like phenotypes. The effect of sugar and phosphate modifications on these phenotypes has not previously been systematically studied. Using a behavioral scoring assay customized to reflect the timing and nature of these effects, we show that both sugar and phosphate modifications influence acute motor phenotypes. Among sugar analogues, PS-DNA induces the strongest motor phenotype while 2-substituted RNA modifications improve the tolerability of PS-ASOs. This helps explain why gapmer ASOs have been more challenging to develop clinically relative to steric blocker ASOs, which have a reduced tendency to induce these effects. Reducing the PS content of gapmer ASOs, which contain a stretch of PS-DNA, improves their toxicity profile, but in some cases also reduces their efficacy or duration of effect. Reducing PS content improved the acute tolerability of ASOs in both mice and sheep. We show that this acute toxicity is not mediated by the major nucleic acid sensing innate immune pathways. Formulating ASOs with calcium ions before injecting into the CNS further improved their tolerability, but through a mechanism at least partially distinct from the reduction of PS content. Overall, our work identifies and quantifies an understudied aspect of oligonucleotide toxicology in the CNS, explores its mechanism, and presents platform-level medicinal chemistry approaches that improve tolerability of this class of compounds.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutics that promote oligodendrocyte survival and remyelination are needed to restore neurological function in demyelinating diseases. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is an essential lipid metabolite that signals through five G-protein coupled receptors. S1P receptor agonists such as Fingolimod are valuable immunosuppressants used to treat multiple sclerosis, and promote oligodendrocyte survival. However, the role for endogenous S1P, synthesized by the enzyme sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2), in oligodendrocyte survival and myelination has not been established. This study investigated the requirement for SphK2 in oligodendrocyte survival and remyelination using the cuprizone mouse model of acute demyelination, followed by spontaneous remyelination. Oligodendrocyte density did not differ between untreated wild- type (WT) and SphK2 knockout (SphK2-/-) mice. However, cuprizone treatment caused significantly greater loss of mature oligodendrocytes in SphK2-/- compared to WT mice. Following cuprizone withdrawal, spontaneous remyelination occurred in WT but not SphK2-/- mice, even though progenitor and mature oligodendrocyte density increased in both genotypes. Levels of cytotoxic sphingosine and ceramide were higher in the corpus callosum of SphK2-/- mice, and in contrast to WT mice, did not decline following cuprizone withdrawal in SphK2-/- mice. We also observed a significant reduction in myelin thickness with ageing in SphK2-/- compared to WT mice. These results provide the first evidence that SphK2, the dominant enzyme catalysing S1P synthesis in the adult brain, is essential for remyelination following a demyelinating insult and myelin maintenance with ageing. We propose that persistently high levels of sphingosine and ceramide, a direct consequence of SphK2 deficiency, may block remyelination.\n\nTable of Contents Image\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=121 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/431183v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e01edcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9fdf6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6012org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a3513b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Main PointsO_LIThe lipid kinase sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) is essential for remyelination following a demyelinating insult (cuprizone).\nC_LIO_LISphK2 protects against cuprizone-mediated oligodendrocyte loss.\nC_LIO_LISphK2 deficiency leads to thinner myelin with ageing.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Decades of research into bacterial persistence has been unable to fully characterize this antibiotic-tolerant phenotype, thereby hampering the development of therapies effective against chronic infections. Although some active persister mechanisms have been identified, the prevailing view is that cells become persistent because they enter a dormant state. We therefore characterized starvation-induced dormancy in Escherichia coli. Our findings indicate that dormancy develops gradually; persistence strongly increases during stationary phase and decreases again as persisters enter the viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state. Importantly, we show that dormancy development is tightly associated with progressive protein aggregation, which occurs concomitantly with ATP depletion during starvation. Persisters contain protein aggregates in an early developmental stage while VBNC cells carry more mature aggregates. Finally, we show that at least one persister protein, ObgE, works by triggering aggregation and thereby changing the dynamics of persistence and dormancy development. These findings provide evidence for a genetically-controlled, gradual development of persisters and VBNC cells through protein aggregation.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial cell envelope is an essential structure that protects the cell from environmental threats, while simultaneously serving as communication interface and diffusion barrier. Therefore, maintaining cell envelope integrity is of vital importance for all microorganisms. Not surprisingly, evolution has shaped conserved protection networks that connect stress perception, transmembrane signal transduction and mediation of cellular responses upon cell envelope stress. The phage shock protein (PSP) stress response is one of such conserved protection networks. Most of the knowledge about the Psp response comes from studies in the Gram-negative model bacterium, Escherichia coli where the Psp system consists of several well-defined protein components. Homologous systems were identified in representatives of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes; however, the Psp system distribution in the microbial world remains largely unknown. By carrying out a large-scale, unbiased comparative genomics analysis, we found components of the Psp system in many bacterial and archaeal phyla and demonstrated that the PSP system deviates dramatically from the proteobacterial prototype. Two of its core proteins, PspA and PspC, have been integrated in various (often phylum-specifically) conserved protein networks during evolution. Based on protein sequence and gene neighborhood analyses of pspA and pspC homologs, we built a natural classification system of PSP networks in bacteria and archaea. We performed a comprehensive in vivo protein interaction screen for the PSP network newly identified in the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis and found a strong interconnected PSP response system, illustrating the validity of our approach. Our study highlights the diversity of PSP organization and function across many bacterial and archaeal phyla and will serve as foundation for future studies of this envelope stress response beyond model organisms.",

While such frameworks recapitulate the cellular entry process in ACE2+ cells, they are largely unable to factor in supplemental contributions by other SARS CoV-2 genes. To address this, we performed an unbiased ORF screen and identified the nucleoprotein (N) as a potent enhancer of spike-pseudotyped LV particle infectivity. We further demonstrate that this augmentation by N renders LV spike particles less vulnerable to the neutralizing effects of a human IgG-Fc fused ACE2 microbody. Biochemical analysis revealed that the spike protein is better enriched in virions when the particles are produced in the presence of SARS CoV-2 nucleoprotein. Importantly, this improvement in infectivity is achieved without a concomitant increase in sensitivity towards RBD binding-based neutralization. Our results hold important implications for the design and interpretation of similar LV pseudotyping-based studies.",

By applying this approach to blood samples from eight participants, we showed that the translation-competent reservoir mainly consists of proviruses with short deletions at the 5-end of the genome, often involving the major splice donor site. TCR and integration site sequencing revealed that antigen-responsive cells can harbor inducible proviruses integrated into cancer-related genes. Furthermore, we found several matches between proviruses retrieved with STIP-Seq and plasma viruses obtained during ART and upon treatment interruption, showing that STIP-Seq can capture clones that are responsible for low-level viremia or viral rebound.",

Current models suggest that activity of these polymerases is predominantly associated with ongoing replication, functioning either at or behind the replication fork. Here we provide evidence for DNA damage-dependent function of a specialized polymerase, DnaE2, in replication-independent conditions. We develop an assay to follow lesion repair in non-replicating Caulobacter and observe that components of the replication machinery localize on DNA in response to damage. These localizations persist in the absence of DnaE2 or if catalytic activity of the polymerase is mutated. Single-stranded DNA gaps for SSB binding and low-fidelity polymerase-mediated synthesis are generated by nucleotide excision repair, as replisome components fail to localize in its absence. This mechanism of gap-filling facilitates cell cycle restoration when cells are released into replication-permissive conditions. Thus, such cross-talk (between activity of NER and specialized polymerases in subsequent gap-filling) helps preserve genome integrity and enhances survival in a replication-independent manner.",

Here, we demonstrate how SAP05 protein effectors from insect-vectored plant pathogenic phytoplasmas take control of several plant developmental processes to simultaneously prolong host lifespan and induce witchs broom-like proliferations of leaf and sterile shoots, organs colonized by phytoplasmas and vectors. SAP05 acts by mediating the concurrent degradation of SPL and GATA developmental regulators via a process that uniquely relies on hijacking the plant ubiquitin receptor RPN10 independently of substrate lysine ubiquitination. RPN10 is highly conserved among eukaryotes, but SAP05 does not bind insect vector RPN10. A two-amino-acid substitution within plant RPN10 generates a functional variant that is resistant to SAP05 activities. Therefore, one effector protein enables obligate parasitic phytoplasmas to induce a plethora of developmental phenotypes in their hosts.",

    "abstract": "Numerous autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk genes are associated with Wnt signaling, suggesting that brain development may be especially sensitive to genetic perturbation of this pathway. Additionally, valproic acid, which modulates Wnt signaling, increases risk for ASD when taken during pregnancy. We previously found that an autism-linked gain-of-function UBE3AT485A mutant construct hyperactivated canonical Wnt signaling, providing a genetic means to elevate Wnt signaling above baseline levels. To identify environmental use chemicals that enhance or suppress Wnt signaling, we screened the ToxCast Phase I and II libraries in cells expressing this autism linked UBE3AT485 gain-of-function mutant construct. Using structural comparisons, we identify classes of chemicals that stimulated Wnt signaling, including ethanolamines, as well as chemicals that inhibited Wnt signaling, such as agricultural pesticides, and synthetic hormone analogs. To prioritize chemicals for follow-up, we leveraged predicted human exposure data, and identified diethanolamine (DEA) as a chemical that both stimulates Wnt signaling in UBE3AT485A-transfected cells and has a high potential for prenatal exposure in humans. DEA also enhanced proliferation in two primary human neural progenitor cell lines. Overall, this study identifies chemicals with the potential for human exposure that influence Wnt signaling in human cells.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has elicited a unique international mobilization of the scientific community to better understand this coronavirus and its associated disease and to develop efficient tools to combat infection. Similar to other coronavirae, SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the host cell complex secretory machinery to produce properly folded viral proteins that will compose the nascent virions; including Spike, Envelope and Membrane proteins, the most exposed membrane viral proteins to the host immune system. Antibody response is part of the anti-viral immune arsenal that infected patients develop to fight viral particles in the body. Herein, we investigate the immunogenic potential of Spike (S), Envelope (E) and Membrane (M) proteins using a human cell-based system to mimic membrane insertion and N-glycosylation. We show that both S and M proteins elicit the production of specific IgG, IgM and IgA in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Elevated Ig responses were observed in COVID+ patients with moderate and severe forms of the disease. Finally, when SARS-CoV-2 Spike D614 and G614 variants were compared, reduced Ig binding was observed with the Spike G614 variant. Altogether, this study underlines the needs for including topological features in envelop proteins to better characterize the serological status of COVID+ patients, points towards an unexpected immune response against the M protein and shows that our assay could represent a powerful tool to test humoral responses against actively evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccine effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Emerin is an integral nuclear envelope protein participating in the maintenance of nuclear shape. When mutated or absent, emerin causes X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). To define how emerin takes parts in molecular scaffolding at the nuclear envelope and helps protect the nucleus against mechanical stress, we established its nanoscale organization using single molecule tracking and super-resolution microscopy. We show that emerin monomers form localized oligomeric nanoclusters stabilized by both lamin A/C and SUN1 at the LINC complex. Interactions of emerin with nuclear actin and BAF additionally modulate its membrane mobility and its ability to oligomerize. In nuclei subjected to mechanical challenges, the mechanotransducing functions of emerin are coupled to changes in its oligomeric state, and the incremental self-assembly of emerin determines nuclear shape adaptation against forces. We also show that the abnormal nuclear envelope deformations induced by EDMD emerin mutants stem from an improper formation of lamin A/C and LINC complex-stabilized emerin oligomers. These findings place emerin at the center of the molecular processes that regulate nuclear shape remodeling in response to mechanical challenges.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary theories of ageing predict a reduction in selection efficiency with age, a so-called  selection shadow, due to extrinsic mortality decreasing effective population size with age. Classic symptoms of ageing include a deterioration in transcriptional regulation and protein homeostasis. Understanding how ant queens defy the trade-off between fecundity and lifespan remains a major challenge for the evolutionary theory of ageing. It has often been discussed that the low extrinsic mortality of ant queens, that are generally well protected within the nest by workers and soldiers, should reduce the selection shadow acting on old queens. We tested this by comparing strength of selection acting on genes upregulated in young and old queens of the ant, Cardiocondyla obscurior. In support of a reduced selection shadow, we find old-biased genes to be under strong purifying selection. We also analysed a gene co-expression network (GCN) with the aim to detect signs of ageing in the form of deteriorating regulation and proteostasis. We find no evidence for ageing. In fact, we detect higher connectivity in old queens indicating increased transcriptional regulation with age. Within the GCN, we discover five highly correlated modules that are upregulated with age. These old-biased modules regulate several anti-ageing mechanisms such as maintenance of proteostasis, transcriptional regulation and stress response. We observe stronger purifying selection on central hub genes of these old-biased modules compared to young-biased modules. These results indicate a lack of transcriptional ageing in old C. obscurior queens possibly facilitated by strong selection at old age and well-regulated anti-ageing mechanisms.\n\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding the exceptional longevity of ant queens and how they defy the trade-off between fecundity and lifespan remains a major challenge for the evolutionary theory and molecular biology of ageing. In this study we offer several clues as to how this occurs on a molecular level in C. obscurior queens. Specifically, we believe a reduction in the selection shadow due to low extrinsic mortality, has allowed the evolution of well-regulated anti-ageing mechanisms. Consequently, we suggest several promising starting points for future research into the poorly understood phenomenon of extreme longevity in ant queens. Making progress in this field will not only allow us to better understand longevity and fertility in social insects but may also offer interesting research strategies for human ageing.",

Pan-genome analyses have been very useful in helping to understand different evolutionary dynamics of bacterial species: an open pan-genome often indicates a free-living lifestyle with metabolic versatility, while closed pan-genomes are linked to host-restricted, ecologically specialised bacteria. A detailed understanding of the species pan-genome has also been instrumental in tracking the phylodynamics of emerging drug resistance mechanisms and drug resistant pathogens. However, current approaches to analyse a species pan-genome do not take the species population structure into account, nor do they account for the uneven sampling of different lineages, as is commonplace due to over-sampling of clinically relevant representatives. Here we present the application of a population structure-aware approach for classifying genes in a pan-genome based on within-species distribution. We demonstrate our approach on a collection of 7,500 E. coli genomes, one of the most-studied bacterial species used as a model for an open pan-genome. We reveal clearly distinct groups of genes, clustered by different underlying evolutionary dynamics, and provide a more biologically informed and accurate description of the species pan-genome.",

    "abstract": "An objective approach for odor detection is to analyze the brain activity using imaging techniques during the odor stimulation. In this study, Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is used to record hemodynamic response from the frontal region of the brain by using a 4-channel fNIRS system. The fNIRs data is collected during the odor detection task in which the subjects were asked to press a button when they detect the given odor. Functional Data Analysis (FDA) was applied on fNIRs data to convert discrete measured samples of data to continuous smooth curves. The FDA method enables us to use the bases coefficients of fNIRS smoothed curves for features that represent the shape of the raw fNIRS signal. With the learning algorithm that we proposed, these features were used to train the support vector machine classifier. We evaluated the odor detection problem, in two binary classification cases: odorant vs. non-odorant and odorant vs. fingertapping. The model achieved a classification accuracy of 94.12% and 97.06% over the stimulus condition in the two cases, respectively. Moreover to find the actual predictors we used the extracted defined features (slope, standard deviation, and delta) to train our classifier. We achieved an average accuracy of 91.18 % on classifying odorant vs. non-odorant and an accuracy of 94.12% for odorant vs. fingertapping on the stimulus condition. The results determined that fNIRs signals of odorant and non-odorant are distinguishable without being affected by the motor activity during the experiment.\n\nThese findings suggest that fNIRs measurement on the forehead could be potentially used for objective and comparably inexpensive assessment of odor detection in cases that the subjective report is unreliable.",

    "abstract": "Flowering time is important due to its roles in adaptation to different environments and subsequent formation of crop yield. Changes in light quality affect a range of developmental processes including flowering time, however little is known about light quality induced flowering time control in lentil. This study aims to investigate the genetic basis for differences in flowering response to light quality in lentil.\n\nWe explored variation in flowering time caused by changes in red/far-red related light quality environments of a lentil interspecific recombinant inbred line population developed from a cross between Lens culinaris cv. Lupa and L. orientalis accession BGE 016880. A genetic linkage map was constructed and then used for identifying QTL associated with flowering time regulation under different light quality environments. Differential gene expression analysis through transcriptomic study and RT-qPCR were used to identify potential candidate genes.\n\nQTL mapping located 13 QTLs controlling flower time under different light quality environments, with phenotypic variance explained ranging from 1.7 to 62.9%. Transcriptomic profiling and gene expression analysis for both parents of this interspecific RIL population identified flowering-related genes showing environment-specific differential expression (flowering DEGs). One of these, a member of the florigen gene family FTa1 (LcFTa1) was located close to 3 major QTLs. Furthermore, gene expression results suggests two other florigen genes (LcFTb1 and LcFTb2), MADS-box transcription factors like LcAGL6/13d, LcSVPb, LcSOC1b and LcFULb, as well as bHLH transcription factor LcPIF6 and Gibberellin 20 oxidase LcGA20oxC,G, may be involved in the light quality response as well.\n\nOur results show that a major component of flowering time sensitivity to light quality is tightly linked to LcFTa1 and associated with changes in its expression.

    "abstract": "Post tetanic potentiation (PTP) is a form of short-term plasticity that lasts for tens of seconds following a burst of presynaptic activity. It has been proposed that PTP arises from protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation of Munc18-1, an SM (Sec1/Munc-18 like) family protein that is essential for release. To test this model, we made a knockin mouse in which all Munc18-1 PKC phosphorylation sites were eliminated through serine-to-alanine point mutations (Munc18-1 SA mice). Expression of Munc18-1 was not altered in Munc18-1SA mice, and there were no obvious behavioral phenotypes. At the hippocampal CA3 to CA1 synapse, and the granule cell parallel fiber to Purkinje cell (PF to PC) synapse, basal transmission was largely normal except for small decreases in paired-pulse facilitation that are consistent with a slight elevation in release probability. Phorbol esters that mimic activation of PKC by diacylglycerol still increased synaptic transmission in Munc18-1 SA mice. In Munc18-1 SA mice, 70% of PTP remained at CA3 to CA1 synapses, and the amplitude of PTP was not reduced at PF to PC synapses. These findings indicate that at both CA3 to CA1 and PF to PC synapses, phorbol esters and PTP enhance synaptic transmission primarily by mechanisms that are independent of PKC phosphorylation of Munc18-1.\n\nSignificance StatementA leading mechanism for a prevalent form of short-term plasticity, post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), involves protein kinase C phosphorylation of Munc18-1. This study tests this mechanism by creating a knock in mouse in which Munc18-1 is replaced by a mutated form of Munc18-1 that cannot be phosphorylated. The main finding is that most PTP at hippocampal CA3 to CA1 synapses, or at cerebellar granule cell to Purkinje cell synapses does not rely on PKC phosphorylation of Munc18-1. Thus, mechanisms independent of PKC phosphorylation of Munc18-1 are important mediators of PTP.",

Here, we identify the NF-{kappa}B family member c-Rel as a critical component of the IL-33-dependent activation of ILC2s. Although c-Rel is dispensable for ILC2 development, it is critical for ILC2 function in the lung, with c-Rel-deficient (c-Rel-/-) mice resistant to papain- and IL-33-induced lung inflammation.

Upon single infusion into a humanized NCG tumor mouse model of human T cell leukemia, AAV generates sufficient numbers of potent in vivo CAR cells, resulting in tumor regression; these in vivo generated CAR cells produce antitumor immunological characteristics.

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) vaccine candidates must be tested for safety and efficacy using preclinical challenge models prior to advancement to human trials, because of the lack of a validated immune correlate or biomarker of protection. New, unbiased tools are urgently needed to expedite the selection of vaccine candidates at an early stage of development and reduce the number of animals experimentally infected with virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb). In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to develop standardised functional ex vivo mycobacterial growth inhibition assays (MGIAs) as a potential surrogate read-out of vaccine efficacy. We have previously described a direct MGIA for use with mouse splenocytes. In the current study, we set out to systematically compare co-culture conditions for the murine direct splenocyte MGIA with respect to both intra-assay repeatability and inter-site reproducibility. Common sample sets were shared between laboratory sites and reproducibility and sensitivity to detect a BCG-vaccine induced response were assessed. Co-culturing 5x106 splenocytes in 48-well plates resulted in improved reproducibility and superior sensitivity to detect a vaccine response compared with standing or rotating sealed 2ml screw-cap tubes. As the difference between naive and BCG vaccinated mice was not consistently detected across both sample sets at both sites, we sought to further improve assay sensitivity by altering the multiplicity of infection (MOI). Cell viability at the end of the co-culture period was improved when splenocyte input number was reduced, with the highest viability for the condition of 3x106 splenocytes in 48-well plates. This cell input was also associated with the greatest sensitivity to detect a BCG vaccine-mediated MGIA response using an M.tb inoculum. Based on our findings, we recommend optimal co-culture conditions in a move towards aligning direct MGIA protocols and generating a cross-species consensus for early evaluation of TB vaccine candidates and biomarker studies.",

    "abstract": "Wound cleansing agents are routine in wound care, even in the absence of signs of infection. Antiseptic activity prevents contaminating microbes from establishing an infection while also raising concerns of cytotoxicity and delayed wound healing. Here, we used an ex vivo human skin excisional wound model to evaluate the cytotoxicity of five clinically-used wound cleaning agents (saline, povidone iodine, Dove(R) soap, Dial(R) soap, and chlorhexidine gluconate). We established a wound contamination model using [~]100 cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa per wound to evaluate antiseptic efficacy and microbial biofilm spatial organization. We found that Dial(R) soap and chlorhexidine gluconate significantly reduced metabolic activity of the biopsies, while all treatments except saline affected local cellular viability. Within the contamination model, only chlorhexidine gluconate treatment resulted in significantly lower P. aeruginosa counts at 24 hours post-treatment, driven by sub-limit-of-detection counts immediately post-treatment. Later applications of chlorhexidine gluconate had no effects on microbial growth, with microscopy showing extensive surface colonization of the wound bed. We present a clinically-relevant model for evaluating antiseptic cytotoxicity and efficacy, with the ability to resolve spatial localization and temporal dynamics of tissue viability and microbial growth.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella spp. express Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) genes to mediate the initial phase of interaction with host cells. Prior studies indicate short-chain fatty acids, microbial metabolites at high concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract, limit SPI-1 gene expression. A number of reports show only a subset of Salmonella cells in a population express these genes, suggesting short-chain fatty acids could decrease SPI-1 population-level expression by acting on per-cell expression and/or the proportion of expressing cells. Here, we combine single-cell, theoretical, and molecular approaches to address the effect of short-chain fatty acids on SPI-1 expression. Our results show short-chain fatty acids do not repress SPI-1 expression by individual cells. Rather, these compounds act to selectively slow the growth of SPI-1 expressing cells, ultimately decreasing their frequency in the population. Further experiments indicate slowed growth arises from short-chain fatty acid-mediated depletion of the proton motive force. By influencing the SPI-1 cell-type proportions, our findings imply gut microbial metabolites act on cooperation between the two cell-types and ultimately influence Salmonellas capacity to establish within a host.\n\nSignificance StatementEmergence of distinct cell-types in populations of genetically identical bacteria is common. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that cooperation between cell-types can be beneficial. This is the case during Salmonella infection, in which cooperation between inflammation-inducing virulent and fast-growing avirulent cell-types occurs during infection to aid in colonization of the host gut. Here, we show gut microbiota-derived metabolites slow growth by the virulent cell-type. Our study implies microbial metabolites shape cooperative interactions between the virulent and avirulent cell types, a finding that can help explain the wide array of clinical manifestations of Salmonella infection.",

    "abstract": "The first insect genome (Drosophila melanogaster) was published two decades ago. Today, nuclear genome assemblies are available for a staggering 601 insect species representing 20 orders. In this study, we analyzed the most-contiguous assembly for each species and provide a \"state of the field\" perspective, emphasizing taxonomic representation, assembly quality, gene completeness, and sequencing technologies. Relative to species richness, genomic efforts have been biased towards four orders (Diptera, Hymenoptera, Collembola, and Phasmatodea), Coleoptera are underrepresented, and 11 orders still lack a publicly available genome assembly. The average insect genome assembly is 439.2 megabases in length with 87.5% of single-copy benchmarking genes intact. Most notable has been the impact of long-read sequencing; assemblies that incorporate long-reads are ~48x more contiguous than those that do not. We offer four recommendations as we collectively continue building insect genome resources: (1) seek better integration between independent research groups and consortia, (2) balance future sampling between filling taxonomic gaps and generating data for targeted questions, (3) take advantage of long read sequencing technologies, and (4) expand and improve gene annotations.\n\nSignificance statementSince the first insect genome was sequenced ~20 years ago, sequencing technologies and the availability of insect genome assemblies have both advanced dramatically. In this study, we curated, analyzed, and summarized the field of insect genomics in terms of taxonomic representation, assembly quality, gene completeness, and sequencing technology. We show that 601 insect species have genome assemblies available, with some groups heavily overrepresented (e.g., Diptera) relative to others (e.g., Coleoptera).

Despite extensive research into MECP2 function, no treatments for RTT are currently available. Here we use an evolutionary genomics approach to construct an unbiased MECP2 gene network, using 1,028 eukaryotic genomes to prioritize proteins with strong co-evolutionary signatures with MECP2. Focusing on proteins targeted by FDA approved drugs led to three promising candidates, two of which were previously linked to MECP2 function (IRAK, KEAP1) and one that was not (EPOR). We show that each of these compounds has the ability to rescue different phenotypes of MECP2 inactivation in cultured human neural cell types, and appear to act on Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-{kappa}B) signaling in inflammation. This study highlights the potential of comparative genomics to accelerate drug discovery, and yields potential new avenues for the treatment of RTT.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/431162v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d7e0f8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f2c602org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a5dd7dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7071c8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The impairment of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) signaling contributes to disease pathology in the muscle wasting disorder Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). nNOS signal propagation occurs through nitric oxide sensitive soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), a critical source of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in muscle. Although both nNOS and sGC activity are impaired in DMD patients, little is known about sGC as a therapeutic target. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that stimulating sGC activity with the allosteric agonist BAY41-8543 mitigates striated muscle pathology in the mdx4cv mouse model of DMD. In contrast to DMD patients, mdx mice exhibited greater basal sGC activity than wild type controls with preservation of cGMP levels due partly to upregulation of sGC in some muscles. Stimulating sGC activity in mdx mice with BAY41-8543 substantially reduced skeletal muscle damage, macrophage densities and inflammation and significantly increased resistance to contraction-induced fatigue. BAY41-8543 also enhanced in vivo diaphragm function while reducing breathing irregularities suggesting improved respiratory function. BAY41-8543 attenuated cardiac hypertrophic remodeling, fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction including left atrium enlargement in aged mdx mice. Overall, sGC stimulation significantly mitigated skeletal and cardio-respiratory dysfunction in mdx4cv mice. Importantly, this study provides compelling pre-clinical evidence supporting sGC as a novel target in DMD and the repurposing of FDA-approved sGC stimulators, such as riociguat and veraciguat, as a novel therapeutic approach for DMD.",

    "abstract": "While language impairment is the defining symptom of aphasia, the co-occurrence of non-language cognitive deficits and their importance in predicting rehabilitation and recovery outcomes is well documented. Despite this, people with aphasia (PWA) are rarely tested on assessments of higher order cognitive functions, making it difficult for studies to associate these functions with a consistent lesion correlate. Contrary to classic models of speech and language, cumulative evidence shows that Brocas area and surrounding regions in the left inferior frontal cortex (LIFC) are involved in, but not specific to, speech production - suggesting that these regions may be involved in higher-level cognitive functions that support language production. A better understanding of language processing in the context of other domain general cognitive functions is essential for improving aphasia treatments.\n\nThis study aimed to explore the brain-behaviour relationships between tests of individual cognitive skill and language abilities in people with post-stroke aphasia, with a focus on language production deficits and their associated lesion correlates. We predicted our analysis would reveal a latent (non-language specific) cognitive component, that would be driven by damage to LIFC.\n\nWe analysed the behavioural and neural correlates of an extensive battery of language and non-language cognitive tests in a sample of thirty-six adults with long-term speech production deficits from post-stroke aphasia. All participants were anomic, with relatively intact speech comprehension and no apraxia of speech. The behavioural variables were analysed using Principal Component Analysis and their neural correlates were estimated using Voxel-Based Correlational Morphology. A significant number of anomic adults showed impaired performance on tests of non-language specific cognitive function. The variance underlying behavioural performance was best captured by four orthogonal components, two higher-order cognitive components (executive functions and verbal working memory) and two linguistic processing components (phonology and semantics). Brain-behaviour relationships revealed separable neural correlates for each component in line with previous studies and an executive functions correlate in the left inferior frontal cortex (LIFC).\n\nOur findings suggest that in adults with chronic post-stroke language production deficits (anomia), higher-level cognitive functions explain more of the variance in language function than classical models of the condition imply. Additionally, lesions to the LIFC, including Brocas area, were associated with executive (dys)function, independent of language abilities, suggesting that lesions to this area are associated with non-language specific higher-level cognitive functions that support speech production. These findings support contemporary models of speech production that place language processing within the context of domain-general perception, action and conceptual knowledge.",

BAV was defined according to embryologic and Sievers classifications. Clinical and echo variables were compared according to aortic valve function. Aortic valve tissues were collected from BAV patients (n=15) operated for severe aortic stenosis (AS-BAV, n=7) or aortic regurgitation (AR-BAV, n=8). RT-qPCR was performed to compare gene expression level in AS-BAV, AR-BAV and controls corresponding to healthy tricuspid aortic valves collected on human heart explant immediately after transplantation (n=5).\n\nRESULTSOut of 223 adults with BAV, mean age 53{+/-}17 years, 83% had left-right coronary cusps fusion, 80% Sievers type 1 BAV and 49% aortopathy. Twenty-four patients had normal valve function, 66 patients had AS-BAV, 91 patients had AR-BAV and 40 patient had AR+AS BAV. BAV phenotype did not predict neither AS-BAV nor AR-BAV (all p>0.1). By multivariable analysis, age >50 (41.6[10.3-248.2],p<0.001) and presence of raphe(12.8[2.4-87.4],p<0.001) were significantly associated with AS-BAV and male gender of AR-BAV(5[1.6-16.4], p=0.005). RT-qPCR revealed overexpression of RUNX2 in AS-BAV (17.67{+/-}1.83 vs 3.25{+/-}0.93, p=0.04), and overexpression of COL1A1 (4.01{+/-}0.6vs2.25{+/-}0.5,p=0.03) and FLNA (23.31{+/-}7.5vs1.97{+/-}0.3,p=0.03) in AR-BAV.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThis prospective study confirmed high prevalence of valve dysfunction at first diagnosis of BAV in a referred population.

    "abstract": "Both absolute and relative brain size vary greatly among and within the major vertebrate lineages. Scientists have long debated how larger brains in primates and hominins translate into greater cognitive performance, and in particular how to control for the relationship between the non-cognitive functions of the brain and body size. One solution to this problem is to establish the slope of cognitive equivalence, that is the line connecting organisms with an identical bauplan but different body sizes. Here, we suggest that intraspecific slopes provide the best available estimate of this measure. This approach was abandoned because slopes were too low by an unknown margin due to estimation error. We control for the error problem by focusing on highly dimorphic primate species with large sample sizes and fitting a line through the mean values for adult females and males. We obtain the best estimate for the slope of ca 0.27, a value much lower than those constructed using all mammal species, and close to the value expected based on the genetic correlation between brain size and body size. We also find that the estimate of cognitive brain size based on cognitive equivalence fits empirical cognitive studies better than the encephalization quotient (EQ), which should therefore be avoided in future studies on primates, and presumably mammals and birds in general. The use of residuals from the line of cognitive equivalence may change conclusions concerning the cognitive abilities of extant and extinct primate species, including hominins.",

    "abstract": "Individual reactions to traumatic stress vary dramatically, yet the biological basis of this variation remains poorly understood. Recent studies demonstrate the surprising plasticity of oligodendrocytes and myelin with stress and experience, providing a potential mechanism by which trauma induces aberrant structural and functional changes in the adult brain. In this study, we utilized a translational approach to test the hypothesis that gray matter myelin contributes to traumatic-stress-induced behavioral variation in both rats and humans. We exposed adult, male rats to a single, severe stressor and used a multimodal approach to characterize avoidance, startle, and fear-learning behavior, as well as oligodendrocyte and myelin content in multiple brain areas. We found that oligodendrocyte cell density and myelin content were correlated with behavioral outcomes in a region-specific manner. Specifically, stress-induced avoidance positively correlated with hippocampal dentate gyrus oligodendrocytes and myelin. Viral overexpression of the oligodendrogenic factor Olig1 in the dentate gyrus was sufficient to induce an anxiety-like behavioral phenotype. In contrast, contextual fear learning positively correlated with myelin in the amygdala and spatial processing regions of the hippocampus. In a group of trauma-exposed US veterans, T1-/T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging estimates of hippocampal and amygdala myelin associated with symptom profiles in a region-specific manner that mirrored the findings in rats. These results demonstrate a species- independent relationship between region-specific, gray matter oligodendrocytes and myelin and differential behavioral phenotypes following traumatic stress exposure. This study suggests a novel mechanism for brain plasticity that underlies individual variance in sensitivity to traumatic stress.",

    "abstract": "The amplitude of activation in brain resting state networks (RSNs), measured with resting-state functional MRI, is heritable and genetically correlated across RSNs, indicating pleiotropy. Recent univariate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) explored the genetic underpinnings of individual variation in RSN activity. Yet univariate genomic analyses do not describe the pleiotropic nature of RSNs. In this study we used a novel multivariate method called genomic SEM to model latent factors that capture the shared genomic influence on RSNs and to identify SNPs and genes driving this pleiotropy. Using summary statistics from GWAS of 21 RSNs reported in UK Biobank (N = 31,688), the genomic latent factor analysis was first conducted in a discovery sample (N = 21,081), and then tested in an independent sample from the same cohort (N = 10,607). In the discovery sample, we show that the genetic organization of RSNs can be best explained by two distinct but correlated genetic factors that divide multimodal association networks and sensory networks. Eleven of the 17 factor loadings were replicated in the independent sample. With the multivariate GWAS, we found and replicated nine independent SNPs associated with the joint architecture of RSNs. Further, by combining the discovery and replication samples, we discovered additional SNP and gene associations with the two factors of RSN amplitude. We conclude that modelling the genetic effects on brain function in a multivariate way is a powerful approach to learn more about the biological mechanisms involved in brain function.",

    "abstract": "Fish is one of the most extensive distributed organisms in the world, fish taxonomy is an important part of biodiversity and is also the basis of fishery resources management. However, the morphological characters are so subtle to identify and intact specimens are not available sometimes, making the research and application of morphological method laborious and time-consuming. DNA barcoding based on a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene is a valuable molecular tool for species identification and biodiversity studies. In this paper, a novel deep learning classification approach that fuses Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), named ESK-model, is proposed bases on DNA barcode. In stage one, ESK-model preprocesses the original data from COI fragments. In stage two, EN-SAE is used to learn the deep features and obtain the outgroup score of each fish. In stage three, KDE is used to select the threshold base on the outgroup scores and classify fish from different families. The effectiveness and superiority of ESK-model have been validated by experiment on three dominant fish families and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Those findings confirm that the ESK-model can accurately classify fish from different family base on DNA barcode.",

    "abstract": "Water quality analysis is an important step in water resources management and needs to be managed efficiently to control any pollution that may affect the ecosystem and to ensure the environmental standards are being met. The development of water quality prediction model is an important step towards better water quality management of rivers. The objective of this work is to utilize a hybrid of Support Vector Regression (SVR) modelling and K-fold cross-validation as a tool for WQI prediction. According to Department of Environment (DOE) Malaysia, a standard Water Quality Index (WQI) is a function of six water quality parameters, namely Ammoniacal Nitrogen (AN), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), pH, and Suspended Solids (SS). In this research, Support Vector Regression (SVR) model is combined with K-fold Cross Validation (CV) method to predict WQI in Langat River, Kajang. Two monitoring stations i.e., L15 and L04 have been monitored monthly for ten years as a case study. A series of results were produced to select the final model namely Kernel Function performance, Hyperparameter Kernel value, K-fold CV value and sets of prediction model value, considering all of them undergone training and testing phases. It is found that SVR model i.e., Nu-RBF combined with K-fold CV i.e., 5-fold has successfully predicted WQI with efficient cost and timely manner. As a conclusion, SVR model and K-fold CV method are very powerful tools in statistical analysis and can be used not limited in water quality application only but in any engineering application.",

    "abstract": "Sex determination in the silkworm, Bombyx mori, is based on Feminizer (Fem), a W-linked Fem piRNA that triggers female development in WZ individuals, and the Z-linked Masculinizer (Masc), which initiates male development and dosage compensation in ZZ individuals. While Fem piRNA is missing in a close relative of B. mori, Masc determines sex in several representatives of distant lepidopteran lineages. We studied the molecular mechanisms of sex determination in the Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella (Pyralidae). We identified an E. kuehniella Masc ortholog, EkMasc, and its paralog resulting from a recent duplication, EkMascB. Both genes are located on the Z chromosome and encode a similar Masc protein that contains two conserved domains but has lost the conserved double zinc finger domain. We developed PCR-based genetic sexing and demonstrated a peak in the expression of EkMasc and EkMascB genes only in early male embryos. Simultaneous knock-down experiments of both EkMasc and EkMascB using RNAi during early embryogenesis led to a shift from male- to female-specific splicing of the E. kuehniella doublesex gene (Ekdsx), their downstream effector, in ZZ embryos and resulted in a strong female-biased sex-ratio. Our results thus confirmed the conserved role of both EkMasc and EkMascB genes in masculinization. We suggest that the C-terminal proline-rich domain, we have identified in all functionally confirmed Masc proteins, in conjunction with the masculinizing domain, is important for transcriptional regulation of sex determination in Lepidoptera. The function of the Masc double zinc finger domain is still unknown, but appears to have been lost in E. kuehniella.\n\nAuthor summaryThe sex-determining cascade in the silkworm, Bombyx mori, differs greatly from those of other insects. In B. mori, female development is initiated by Fem piRNA expressed from the W chromosome during early embryogenesis. Fem piRNA silences Masculinizer (Masc) thereby blocking the male pathway resulting in female development. It is currently unknown whether this cascade is conserved across Lepidoptera. In the Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella, we identified an ortholog of Masc and discovered its functional duplication on the Z chromosome, which has not yet been found in any other lepidopteran species. We provide two lines of evidence that both the EkMasc and EkMascB genes play an essential role in masculinization: (i) they show a peak of expression during early embryogenesis in ZZ but not in WZ embryos and (ii) their silencing by RNAi results in female-specific splicing of the E. kuehniella doublesex gene (Ekdsx) in ZZ embryos and in a female-biased sex ratio. Our results suggest a conserved role of the duplicated Masc gene in sex determination of E. kuehniella.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic meiosis is a specialized cell cycle involving two successive nuclear divisions that lead to the formation of haploid gametes. The phosphatase Cdc14 plays an essential role in meiosis as revealed in studies of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cdc14 is stored in the nucleolus, a sub-nuclear domain containing the ribosomal DNA, and its release is regulated by two distinct pathways, one acting in early anaphase I of meiosis and a second at the exit from meiosis II. The early anaphase release is thought to be important for disjunction of the ribosomal DNA, disassembly of the anaphase I spindle, spindle pole re-duplication and the counteraction of CDK, all of which are required for progression into meiosis II. The release of Cdc14 from its nucleolar binding partner Net1 is stimulated by phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase sites in Net1, but the importance of that phospho-regulation in meiosis is not well understood. We induced net1-6cdk mutant cells to enter meiosis and examined the localization of Cdc14 and various indicators of meiotic progression. The net1-6cdk mutations inhibit, but dont fully prevent Cdc14 release, and they almost completely prevent disjunction of the ribosomal DNA during meiosis I. Failure to disjoin the ribosomal DNA is lethal in mitosis, and we expected the same to be true in meiosis. However, the cells were able to complete meiosis II, yielding the expected four meiotic products as viable spores. Therefore, all ribosomal DNA disjunction required for meiosis can occur in meiosis II. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of meiotic chromosome segregation.",

    "abstract": "Stemona sessilifolia (Miq.) Miq., commonly known as Baibu, is one of the most popular herbal medicines in Asia. In Chinese Pharmacopoeia, Baibu has multiple authentic sources, and there are many homonym herbs sold as Baibu in the herbal medicine market. The existence of the counterfeits of Baibu brings challenges to its identification. To assist the accurate identification of Baibu, we sequenced and analyzed the complete chloroplast genome of Stemona sessilifolia using next-generation sequencing technology. The genome was 154,039 bp in length, possessing a typical quadripartite structure consisting of a pair of inverted repeats (IRs: 27,094 bp) separating by a large single copy (LSC: 81,950 bp) and a small single copy (SSC: 17,901 bp). A total of 112 unique genes were identified, including 80 protein-coding, 28 transfer RNA, and four ribosomal RNA genes. Besides, 45 tandem, 27 forward, 23 palindromic, and 72 simple sequence repeats were detected in the genome by repeat analysis. Compared with its counterfeits (Asparagus officinalis and Carludovica palmate), we found that IR expansion and SSC contraction events of Stemona sessilifolia resulted in two copies of the rpl22 gene in the IR regions and partial duplication of the ndhF gene in the SSC region. Secondly, an approximately 3-kb-long inversion was identified in the LSC region, leading to the petA and cemA gene presented in the complementary strand of the chloroplast DNA molecule. Comparative analysis revealed some highly variable regions, including trnF-GAA_ndhJ, atpB_rbcL, rps15_ycf1, trnG-UCC_trnR-UCU, ndhF_rpl32. Finally, gene loss events were investigated in the context of phylogenetic relationships. In summary, the complete plastome of Stemona sessilifolia will provide valuable information for the molecular identification of Baibu and assist in elucidating the evolution of Stemona sessilifolia.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTomatoes are consumed daily. Unfortunately, abuse of pesticide application by vegetable growers in Uganda increases risks of pesticide residue exposure among consumers, as they may be above Maximum Residue Limits (European Union Maximum Residue Limits used as a standard in Uganda). This study aimed to determine consumer attitudes and risk perceptions towards pesticide-stained tomatoes in Uganda to support interventions that could be used to reduce pesticide residue exposures in food.\n\nMethodsA mixed methods cross-sectional study sampled 468 household consumers in four regions of Uganda, selecting one district (interventional project area) per region. In each district, about 60 household members were randomly selected from a total of three Sub Counties and interviewed. In addition, 9 tomato handlers (three tomato farmers, three tomato retailers, and three tomato wholesalers) participated in Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) per district. Collected data were entered into MS-Excel 13 and exported into Stata version 14.0 for cleaning and analysis at a 5% level of significance and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). The proportion of risk perceptions and attitudes were computed and presented as percentages, while factors associated with risk perception were determined using Fisher exact test. Qualitative data collected under a traditional theory were analyzed using thematic content analysis.\n\nResultsMore than half, 54.2% (253/468), of the respondents were females, mean age was 37 years (SD=13.13, ranging from 18 to 88 years). Half of the respondents, 50.9% (238/467), were farmers by occupation, and 40.3% (188/468) had completed upper primary education. Only 5.0% (20/396) of consumers reported a high-risk perception towards tomatoes stained with pesticide residues, the rest, 95.0% (376/396), were buying pesticide-stained tomatoes despite their awareness of the possible health effects. The main reason for buying the pesticide-stained tomatoes was that a majority, 59.0% (230/390), lacked an alternative to stained tomatoes like organically grown tomatoes. However, consumers generally had a negative attitude towards pesticide-stained tomatoes, with 67.0% (313/468) of the consumers disagreeing with a statement that tomatoes sold on the market are safe. Consumer risk perception was significantly associated with their awareness about residues in the tomatoes; where the proportion of consumers who were aware of the risk of pesticide-stained tomatoes was 42.8 times more likely not to buy stained tomatoes compared to the proportion of those who were not aware. OR, 42.8 (95% CI: 10.76-170.28). However, after Fisher-Exact tests analysis, level of education P(0.975), gender P(0.581), and age group P(0.680) were not associated with consumer risk perception (95% CI and 5% level of significance).\n\nConclusionAlthough the consumers had a negative attitude towards the pesticide-stained tomatoes, their risk perception towards them ranked low, with most consumers buying tomatoes stained with pesticide residues due to a lack of an alternative. Ministry of Agriculture extension service efforts should promote and emphasize community to start household-based organic kitchen gardens as the efforts for the establishment of a national pesticide residue monitoring center awaits.",

This reversible transformation of one cell type to another, is a common response to petroleum-product exposure in molluscs.

Here we document for the first time that wild adult oysters inhabiting coastal waters in the northern Gulf of Mexico during and in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (2010) exhibited metaplasia in both ctenidia and digestive epithelia at significantly higher levels than geographic controls of C. virginica from Chesapeake Bay. Both ctenidial (respiratory and suspension feeding) and digestive tract tissues exhibited significantly higher frequencies of metaplasia in specimens from the Gulf of Mexico compared to those from Chesapeake Bay. Metaplasia included the loss of epithelial cilia, transformations of columnar epithelia, hyperplasia and reduction of ctenidial branches, and vacuolization of digestive tissues. Evidence for a reduction of metaplasia following the oil spill (2010-2013) is suggestive but equivocal.",

    "abstract": "Oligodendrocytes exert a profound influence on neural circuits by accelerating axon potential conduction, altering excitability and providing metabolic support. As oligodendrogenesis continues in the adult brain and is essential for myelin repair, uncovering the factors that control their dynamics is necessary to understand the consequences of adaptive myelination and develop new strategies to enhance remyelination in diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Unfortunately, few methods exist for analysis of oligodendrocyte dynamics, and even fewer are suitable for in vivo investigation. Here, we describe the development of a fully automated cell tracking pipeline using convolutional neural networks (Oligo-Track) that provides rapid volumetric segmentation and tracking of thousands of cells over weeks in vivo. This system reliably replicated human analysis, outperformed traditional analytic approaches, and extracted injury and repair dynamics at multiple cortical depths, establishing that oligodendrogenesis after cuprizone-mediated demyelination is suppressed in deeper cortical layers. Volumetric data provided by this analysis revealed that oligodendrocyte soma size progressively decreases after their generation, and declines further prior to death, providing a means to predict cell age and eventual cell death from individual time points. This new CNN-based analysis pipeline offers a rapid, robust method to quantitatively analyze oligodendrocyte dynamics in vivo, which will aid in understanding how changes in these myelinating cells influence circuit function and recovery from injury and disease.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) often have fragmentation of sleep/wake cycles and disrupted 24-h (circadian) activity. Despite this, little work has investigated the potential underlying day/night disruptions in cognition and neuronal physiology in the hippocampus. The molecular clock, an intrinsic transcription-translation feedback loop that regulates circadian behavior, may also regulate hippocampal neurophysiological activity. We hypothesized that disrupted diurnal variation in clock gene expression in the hippocampus corresponds with loss of normal day/night differences in membrane excitability, synaptic physiology, and cognition. We previously reported that the Tg-SwDI mouse model of AD has disrupted circadian locomotor rhythms and neurophysiological output of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (the primary circadian clock). Here, we report that Tg-SwDI mice failed to show day-night differences in a spatial working memory task, unlike wild-type controls that exhibited enhanced spatial working memory at night. Moreover, Tg-SwDI mice had lower levels of Per2, one of the core components of the molecular clock, at both mRNA and protein levels when compared to age-matched controls. Interestingly, we discovered neurophysiological impairments in area CA1 of the Tg-SwDI hippocampus. In controls, spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) in pyramidal cells showed greater amplitude and lower inter-event interval during the day than the night. However, the normal day/night differences in sIPSCs were absent (amplitude) or reversed (inter-event interval) in pyramidal cells from Tg-SwDI mice. In control mice, current injection into CA1 pyramidal cells produced more firing during the night than during the day, but no day/night difference in excitability was observed in Tg-SwDI mice. The normal day/night difference in excitability in controls was blocked by GABA receptor inhibition. Together, these results demonstrate that the normal diurnal regulation of inhibitory transmission in the hippocampus is diminished in a mouse model of AD, leading to decreased daytime inhibition onto hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. Uncovering disrupted day/night differences in circadian gene regulation, hippocampal physiology, and memory in AD mouse models may provide insight into possible chronotherapeutic strategies to ameliorate Alzheimers disease symptoms or delay pathological onset.",

    "abstract": "The output of neocortical layer 5 pyramidal cells (L5PCs) is expressed by a train of single spikes with intermittent bursts of multiple spikes at high frequencies. The bursts are the result of nonlinear dendritic properties, including Na+, Ca2+, and NMDA spikes, that interact with the [~]10,000 synapses impinging on the neurons dendrites. Output spike bursts are thought to implement key dendritic computations, such as coincidence detection of bottom-up inputs (arriving mostly at the basal tree) and top-down inputs (arriving mostly at the apical tree). In this study we used a detailed nonlinear model of L5PC receiving excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to explore the conditions for generating bursts and for modulating their properties. We established the excitatory input conditions on the basal versus the apical tree that favor burst and show that there are two distinct types of bursts. Bursts consisting of 3 or more spikes firing at < 200 Hz, which are generated by stronger excitatory input to the basal versus the apical tree, and bursts of [~]2-spikes at [~]250 Hz, generated by prominent apical tuft excitation. Localized and well-timed dendritic inhibition on the apical tree differentially modulates Na+, Ca2+, and NMDA spikes and, consequently, finely controls the burst output.

Based on antigenic and genetic variations, Human respiratory syncytial virus is divided into two subgroups (A and B). Each of the subgroups is further categorized into genotypes based on the phylogenetic analyses of the sequences of the second hypervariable region.\n\nMethodsNasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) were collected from patients of the First Peoples Hospital in Huzhou from January 2016 to December 2019. Real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) was performed using double nucleic acid detection kit for respiratory syncytial virus (A\\B) (Shenzhen shengkeyuan) with the ABI Q7 (Applied Biosystems). For genotyping, the primer set A-F/A-R was used to amplify the G protein of HRSV-A. Primer set B-F/B-R was used to amplify the G protein of HRSV-B. The phylogenetic analysis was constructed using the neighbor-joining algorithm with the Kimura two-parameter model and supported statistically by bootstrapping with 1000 replicates with MEGA software (version 7.0) with 1000 bootstrap replicates.\n\nResultsA total of 973 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from January 2016 to December 2019, and 63 samples were positive for RSV nucleic acid, with the detection rate of 6.47%.

Infection with RSV was found in all age groups tested, with the 0-1 year age group having the highest detection rate 15.2%. The detection rate was high from November to next March. Phylogenetic analysis clustered HRSV-A strains identified in Huzhou into ON1genotype. All 17 of the HRSV-B strains belonged to BA9 genotype.\n\nConclusionsWe analyzed the HRSV strains circulation in Huzhou from January 2016 to December 2019 in Huzhou, China. This is the first molecular analysis on HRSV in Huzhou. We found Subgroup A and B of RSV were co-circulating and the 0-1 year age group having the highest infection rate.",

However, extra-pulmonary pathologies of SARS-CoV-2 infection that result in long Covid remains undefined in GSH. Here, using in silico modelling we show that hamster angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) interaction with SARS-CoV-2 is similar to human. Intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection in GSH resulted in early onset of lung pathologies marked by aggressive inflammatory response. Remarkably, late phase of SARS-CoV2 infection in GSH showed cardiovascular complications (CVC) characterized by ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular wall thickening, interstitial coronary fibrosis and altered lipidomics with elevated cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and long chain fatty acid triglycerides. Moreover, serum metabolomics profile of infected GSH correlated with Covid19 patients. Together, we propose GSH as a suitable animal model to study immediate and long Covid19 pathologies that could be extended to therapeutics against Covid19 related CVC.",

    "abstract": "Complex biological functions within organisms are frequently orchestrated by systemic communication between tissues. In the model organism C. elegans, the pharyngeal and body wall neuromuscular junctions are two discrete structures that control feeding and locomotion, respectively. These distinct tissues are controlled by separate, well-defined neural circuits. Nonetheless, the emergent behaviours, feeding and locomotion, are coordinated to guarantee the efficiency of food intake. We show that pharmacological hyperactivation of cholinergic transmission at the body wall muscle reduces the rate of pumping behaviour. This was evidenced by a systematic screening of the cholinesterase inhibitor aldicarbs effect on the rate of pharyngeal pumping on food in mutant worms. The screening revealed that the key determinant of the inhibitory effect of aldicarb on pharyngeal pumping is the L-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expressed in body wall muscle. This idea was reinforced by the observation that selective hyperstimulation of the body wall muscle L-type receptor by the agonist levamisole inhibited pumping. Overall, our results reveal that body wall cholinergic transmission controls locomotion and simultaneously couples a distal inhibition of feeding.",

Such predictions generally arise from mathematical models that incorporate the temperature dependence of traits measured under laboratory conditions. These temperature-trait relationships are typically estimated from juvenile populations reared under optimal resource conditions, even though natural populations experience intermittent resource depletion. Using laboratory experiments on the mosquito Aedes aegypti, combined with a stage-structured population model, we show that resource depletion in the juvenile habitat can significantly depress the vectors maximal population growth rate (rm) across the entire temperature range, cause it to peak at a lower temperature, and narrow its thermal niche width. Our results provide compelling evidence for future studies to consider resource depletion when predicting the effects of global change on vector-borne disease transmission, disease vectors and other arthropods.",

    "abstract": "Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a highly transmissible respiratory infection caused by Bordetella pertussis. Due to the high burden of pertussis, vaccine programmes were introduced internationally and in Australia since the 1950s. This has resulted in a significant decrease of pertussis infections. However, since the 1990s the number of pertussis notifications has increased considerably. Currently circulating B. pertussis strains differ in vaccine antigen composition compared to strains that circulated in the pre-vaccination era. These genetic differences are thought to contribute, in part, to the re-emergence of pertussis in Australia and around the world. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) can resolve minute differences in circulating strains and provides unparalleled resolution of vaccine antigens. This high-resolution snapshot can provide clues that enable more targeted public health interventions. However, pertussis is primarily diagnosed with culture-independent diagnostic assays which offer fast turnaround result times and reduced laboratory costs, eliminating the need to culture isolates. Current WGS methods require a cultured isolate, resulting in an absence of B. pertussis genome sequences in the post vaccination era. This scarcity has, in turn, limited understanding of currently circulating strains and respective vaccine antigen compositions.\n\nRecent advancements of WGS technologies have allowed direct sequencing of clinical specimens without the need for a cultured isolate. However, recovering reliable sequence data from clinical samples of low bacterial load infections such as B. pertussis is a pressing challenge. We sought to increase the yield of B. pertussis sequences direct from a clinical sample by evaluating widely available WGS library preparation methods.\n\nWe report that the Illumina DNA prep library preparation kit combined with deep sequencing allowed the detection of important surveillance information such as allelic variations in the B. pertussis vaccine antigens. Further, our method generates high coverage over the 23S ribosomal RNA of B. pertussis enabling macrolide resistance to be easily determined. Overall, this method can improve surveillance of B. pertussis, by monitoring changes in vaccine antigens, detecting antimicrobial resistance and guiding Public Health control interventions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTree species with narrow ranges are a conservation concern because heightened extinction risk accompanies their small populations. Assessing risks for these species is challenging, however, especially in tropical flora where their sparse populations seldom appear in traditional plots and inventories. Here, we utilize instead large scale databases that combine tree records from many sources to test hypotheses about where the narrow-range tree species of Panama are concentrated.\n\nMethodsAll individual records were collected from public databases, and the range size of each tree species found in Panama was estimated as a polygon around all its locations. Rare species were defined as those with ranges < 20,000 km2. We divided Panama into geographic regions and elevation zones and counted the number of individual records and the species richness in each, separating rare species from all other species.\n\nResultsThe proportion of rare species peaked at elevations above 2000 m, reaching 17.3% of the species recorded. At lower elevation across the country, the proportion was 6-11%, except in the dry Pacific region, where it was 1.5%. Wet forests of the Caribbean coast had 8.4% rare species, slightly higher than other regions. The total number of rare species, however, peaked at mid-elevation, not high elevation, because total species richness was highest there.\n\nConclusionsHigh elevation forests of west Panama have higher endemicity of trees than all low-elevation regions. Dry forests had the lowest endemicity. This supports the notion that montane forests of Central America should be a conservation focus, however, given generally higher diversity at low- to mid-elevation, lowlands are also important habitats for rare species.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria have evolved a remarkably powerful CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM), enabling high photosynthetic rates in environments with limited inorganic carbon (Ci). Therefore, this CCM is a promising system for integration into higher plant chloroplasts to boost photosynthetic efficiency and yield. The CCM depends on active Ci uptake, facilitated by bicarbonate transporters and CO2 pumps, to elevate CO2 concentration around the active sites of the primary CO2 fixing enzyme, Rubisco, which is encapsulated in cytoplasmic micro-compartments (carboxysomes). The essential CCM proteins have been identified, but the molecular signals and regulators that coordinate function in response to light, Ci availability and other environmental cues are largely unknown. Here, we provide evidence, based on a novel in vitro binding system, for a role of the PII-like SbtB protein in regulating Ci uptake by the bicarbonate transporter, SbtA, in response to the cellular adenylate energy charge (AEC) through dynamic protein-protein interaction. Binding of the SbtA and SbtB proteins from two phylogenetically distant species, Cyanobium sp. PCC7001 and Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942, was inhibited by high ATP, and promoted by low [ATP]:[ADP or AMP] ratios in vitro, consistent with a sensory response to the AEC mediated through adenylnucleotide ligand-specific conformation changes in SbtB. In vivo, cell cultures of S. elongatus showed up to 70% SbtB-dependent down-regulation of SbtA bicarbonate uptake activity specifically in the light activation phase during transitions from dark to low light when low cellular AEC is expected to limit metabolic activity. This suggests SbtB may function as a curfew protein during prolonged low cellular AEC and photosynthetically unfavourable conditions to prevent energetically futile and physiologically disadvantageous activation of SbtA.",

    "abstract": "The influence of microbiota on mosquito physiology and vector competence is becoming increasingly clear but our understanding of interactions between microbiota and mosquitoes still remains incomplete. Here we show that gut microbiota of Anopheles stephensi, a competent malaria vector, participates mosquito tryptophan metabolism. Elimination of microbiota by antibiotics treatment leads to the accumulation of tryptophan (Trp) and its metabolites, kynurenine (Kyn), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) and xanthurenic acid (XA). Of these, 3-HK impairs the structure of peritrophic matrix (PM), thereby promoting Plasmodium berghei infection. Among the major gut microbiota in An. stephensi, Pseudomonas alcaligenes plays a role in catabolizing 3-HK as revealed by whole genome sequencing and LC-MS metabolic analysis. The genome of P. alcaligenes encodes kynureninase (KynU) that is responsible for the conversion of 3-HK to 3-Hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA). Mutation of this gene abrogates the ability of P. alcaligenes to metabolize 3-HK, which in turn abolishes its role on PM protection. Colonization of An. stephensi with KynU mutated P. alcaligenes fails to protect mosquitoes against parasite infection as effectively as those with wild type bacterium. In summary, we identify an unexpected function of gut microbiota in controlling mosquito tryptophan metabolism with the major consequences on vector competence.",

    "abstract": "SecSel, a protected-area prioritization tool, has been developed to help design areas that efficiently protect multiple features, including conservation of biodiversity and use of ecosystem services. The prioritization by SecSel is based on evaluation of the local units of each feature. The evaluation metrics should be quantitative but need not be ratio scale. The minimum requirement of the input data is that they are ordinal. The conservation target is the number of local units with high values of each feature to be protected in the area. SecSel can handle conflicts among features, including conflicts between conservation and utilization of land or specific ecosystem functions. Before the selection procedure, one of a conflicting pair of features in a site is discarded. That decision is based on the dispensability of the local unit to fulfilling the conservation target of each feature. SecSel also considers the cost of including each site in the protected area and the compactness of the area in terms of total boundary length or the distance to the nearest site. To demonstrate the functionality of Secsel, we used it to design land use in an alpine region of northern Japan where conservation of alpine vegetation and its recreational use are important considerations.",

    "abstract": "Color perception relies on spatial comparisons of chromatic signals, but how the brain performs these comparisons is poorly understood. Here, we show that many V1 neurons compare signals across their receptive fields (RF) using a common principle. We estimated the spatial-chromatic RFs of each neuron, and then measured neural selectivity to customized colored edges that were sampled using a novel closed-loop technique. We found that many double-opponent (DO) cells, which have spatially and chromatically opponent RFs, responded to chromatic contrast as a weighted sum, akin to how simple cells respond to luminance contrast. Other neurons integrated chromatic signals non-linearly, confirming that linear signal integration is not an obligate property of V1 neurons. The functional similarity of DO and simple cells suggests a common underlying neural circuitry, promotes the construction of image-computable models for full-color image representation, and sheds new light on V1 complex cells.",
