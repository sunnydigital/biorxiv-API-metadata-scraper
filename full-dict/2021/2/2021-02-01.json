    "abstract": "Membrane based cells are the fundamental structure and function units of organisms, while evidences were increasing that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is associated with the formation of membraneless organelles, such as P-bodies, nucleoli and stress granules. Many studies have been undertaken to explore the functions of protein phase separation, but these studies lacked an effective tool to identify the sequence segments that critical for LLPS (SCOPEs). In this study, we presented a novel software called dSCOPE (http://dscope.omicsbio.info) to predict the SCOPEs. To develop the predictor, we curated experimentally identified sequence segments that can drive LLPS from published literature. Then sliding sequence window based physiological, biochemical, structural and coding features were integrated by random forest algorithm to perform prediction. Through rigorous evaluation, dSCOPE was demonstrated to achieve satisfactory performance. Furthermore, large-scale analysis of human proteome based on dSCOPE showed that the predicted SCOPEs enriched various protein post-translational modifications and cancer mutations, and the proteins which contain predicted SCOPEs enriched critical cellular signaling pathways. Taken together, dSCOPE precisely predicted the protein sequence segments critical for LLPS, with various helpful information visualized in the webserver to facilitate LLPS related research.",

    "abstract": "General-purpose protein structure embedding can be used for many important protein biology tasks, such as protein design, drug design and binding affinity prediction. Recent researches have shown that attention-based encoder layers are more suitable to learn high-level features. Based on this key observation, we treat low-level representation learning and high-level representation learning separately, and propose a two-level general-purpose protein structure embedding neural network, called ContactLib-ATT. On the local embedding level, a simple yet meaningful hydrogen-bond representation is learned. On the global embedding level, attention-based encoder layers are employed for global representation learning. In our experiments, ContactLib-ATT achieves a SCOP superfamily classification accuracy of 82.4% (i.e., 6.7% higher than state-of-the-art method) on the SCOP40 2.07 dataset. Moreover, ContactLib-ATT is demonstrated to successfully simulate a structure-based search engine for remote homologous proteins, and our top-10 candidate list contains at least one remote homolog with a probability of 91.9%.

    "abstract": "BackgroundWe developed super-delta2, a differential gene expression analysis pipeline designed for multi-group comparisons for RNA-seq data. It includes a customized one-way ANOVA F-test and a post-hoc test for pairwise group comparisons; both are designed to work with a multivariate normalization procedure to reduce technical noise. It also includes a trimming procedure with bias-correction to obtain robust and approximately unbiased summary statistics used in these tests. We demonstrated the asymptotic applicability of super-delta2 to log-transformed read counts in RNA-seq data by large sample theory based on Negative Binomial Poisson (NBP) distribution.\n\nResultsWe compared super-delta2 with three commonly used RNA-seq data analysis methods: limma/voom, edgeR, and DESeq2 using both simulated and real datasets. In all three simulation settings, super-delta2 not only achieved the best overall statistical power, but also was the only method that controlled type I error at the nominal level. When applied to a breast cancer dataset to identify differential expression pattern associated with multiple pathologic stages, super-delta2 selected more enriched pathways than other methods, which are directly linked to the underlying biological condition (breast cancer).\n\nConclusionsBy incorporating trimming and bias-correction in the normalization step, super-delta2 was able to achieve tight control of type I error. Because the hypothesis tests are based on asymptotic normal approximation of the NBP distribution, super-delta2 does not require computationally expensive iterative optimization procedures used by methods such as edgeR and DESeq2, which occasionally have convergence issues.",

    "abstract": "Cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides are a diverse family of cationic amphipathic peptides with multiple activities. In humans, cathelicidin LL-37 is one of the main host defense peptides with a remarkable medical and biotechnological potential. Deregulation of LL-37 expression has been associated with inflammatory diseases. However the effects of point mutations driven by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on LL-37 are unknown. Here we applied an array of computational tools to investigate the effects of such mutations on LL-37 structure and activity. Due to the fact that, on cathelicidins, the prodomain is more conserved than the mature peptide, the SNP effect predictions were biased and, overall, resulted in neutral effects; and due to the slight changes in physicochemical properties, the antimicrobial predictions indicated the maintenance of such activity. Nonetheless, R07P, R07W, R29Q, R29W mutations reduced the peptide net charge, which in turn could result in less active LL-37 variants. Molecular dynamics data indicated that R07Q and N30Y mutations altered the LL-37 structure, leading to potential deleterious effects. In addition, the helix dipole is altered in G03A, R07P, R07W and L31P mutations, which could also alter the antimicrobial activity. Our results indicated that despite the mutations did not alter the residues from LL-37 active core, they could influence the antimicrobial activity and consequently, could be involved in inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "In silico, cell based approaches for modeling biological morphogenesis are used to test and validate our understanding of the biological and mechanical process that are at work during the growth and the organization of multi-cell tissues. As compared to in vivo experiments, computer based frameworks dedicated to tissue modeling allow us to easily test different hypotheses, and to quantify the impact of various biophysically relevant parameters.\n\nHere, we propose a formalism based on a detailed, yet simple, description of cells that accounts for intra-, inter- and extra-cellular mechanisms. More precisely, the cell growth and division is described through the space and time evolution of the membrane vertices. These vertices follow a Newtonian dynamics, meaning that their evolution is con-trolled by different types of forces: a membrane force (spring and bending), an adherence force (inter-cellular spring), external and internal pressure forces. Different evolution laws can be applied on the internal pressure, depending on the intra-cellular mechanism of interest. In addition to the cells dynamics, our formalism further relies on a lattice Boltzmann method, using the Palabos library, to simulate the diffusion of chemical signals. The latter aims at driving the growth and migration of a tissue by simply changing the state of the cells.\n\nAll of this leads to an accurate description of the growth and division of cells, with realistic cell shapes and where membranes can have different properties. While this work is mainly of methodological nature, we also propose to validate our framework through simple, yet biologically relevant benchmark tests at both single-cell and full tissue scales. This includes free and chemically controlled cell tissue growth in an unbounded domain. The ability of our framework to simulate cell migration, cell compression and morphogenesis under external constraints is also investigated in a qualitative manner.",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) inside root-nodules is a primary and sustainable source of soil nitrogen. Understanding nodule development and metabolism in crop legumes may lead to more effective SNF in agriculture. Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) is an economically important allotetraploid legume with non-canonical nodule developmental features. Recent genome sequencing of peanut has opened the possibility of making peanut a model for studying atypical nodule development. To help the community of nodule biologists, we have developed a database called AhNGE (Arachis hypogaea Nodule Developmental Gene Expression: http://nipgr.ac.in/AhNGE/index.php). AhNGE contains RNAseq data from six data points of nodule development in A. hypogagea cv. Tifrunner. This data represents a dynamic view of gene expression during peanut nodule development. Research in model legumes has generated a huge knowledgebase in the last twenty years. To streamline comparative genomics among legumes, we performed ortholog analysis among four legumes (Cicer, Glycine, Lotus, and Medicago) and one non-legume (Arabidopsis). This will facilitate the integration of existing knowledge in nodule development with the Arachis transcriptome. The available data can be retrieved using a single or batch query or searching using gene ID, from above mentioned five species. The output displays the gene expression pattern in graphical as well as tabular form, along with further options to download the sequence data. The database is linked with PeanutBase, the main genomic resource of peanut. Additionally, the expression level of different splicing variants can be retrieved from the database. In summary, AhNGE serves as an important resource for the scientific community working on nodule development.",

    "abstract": "MotivationUnderstanding how proteins recognize their RNA targets is essential to elucidate regulatory processes in the cell. Many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) form complexes or have multiple domains that allow them to bind to RNA in a multivalent, cooperative manner. They can thereby achieve higher specificity and affinity than proteins with a single RNA-binding domain. However, current approaches to de-novo discovery of RNA binding motifs do not take multivalent binding into account.\n\nResultsWe present Bipartite Motif Finder (BMF), which is based on a thermodynamic model of RBPs with two cooperatively binding RNA-binding domains. We show that bivalent binding is a common strategy among RBPs, yielding higher affinity and sequence specificity. We furthermore illustrate that the spatial geometry between the binding sites can be learned from bound RNA sequences. These discovered bipartite motifs are consistent with previously known motifs and binding behaviors. Our results demonstrate the importance of multivalent binding for RNA-binding proteins and highlight the value of bipartite motif models in representing the multivalency of protein-RNA interactions.\n\nAvailabilityBMF source code is available at https://github.com/soedinglab/bipartite_motif_finder under a GPL license.

By comparing features of these structurally similar proteins, we can determine what features are particular to the environment rather than the fold. Here we compare structures of membrane {beta}-barrels to soluble {beta}-barrels and evaluate their relative size, shape, amino acid composition, hydrophobicity, and periodicity. We find that membrane {beta}-barrels are generally larger than soluble {beta}-barrels in with more strands per barrel and more amino acids per strand, making them wider and taller. We also find that membrane {beta}-barrels are inside-out soluble {beta}-barrels. The inward region of membrane {beta}-barrels have similar hydrophobicity to the outward region of soluble {beta}-barrels, and the outward region of membrane {beta}-barrels has similar hydrophobicity to the inward region of the soluble {beta}-barrels. Moreover, even though both types of {beta}-barrel have been assumed to have strands with amino acids that alternate in direction and hydrophobicity, we find that the membrane {beta}-barrels have more regular alternation than soluble {beta}-barrels.

    "abstract": "The enzyme triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) performs a crucial role in the extraction of energy from glucose, doing so by converting dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) into glyceraldehyde phosphate, thereby doubling the yield of ATP molecules during glycolysis. The initial step of the mechanism is the seemingly unlikely abstraction of the pro-R methylene hydrogen from C1 by a conserved glutamate (Glu165), an assignment that has been both universally accepted yet a much-studied phenomenon for decades. In this work we introduce an alternative mechanism in which water as a strong general base abstracts the carbon proton acting effectively as hydroxide. We posit that strong electric fields associated with the substrate phosphate promote facile autoionization of water trapped near the phosphate dianion of DHAP and Glu165, an example of substrate assisted catalysis. Classical molecular dynamics simulations assert that the closest water oxygen atom is consistently closer to the pro-R H than the carboxylate oxygen atoms of the accepted base Glu165. Our proposal is further supported by quantum computations that confirm the implausibility of abstraction of the methylene hydrogen by glutamate and the ease with which it is abstracted by hydroxide. The necessity of Glu165 for efficient catalysis is attributed to its crucial involvement in trapping the vital water in an environment of high electric fields which promote ionization far more rapidly than in bulk solvent.",

To discover hubs of interacting malignant and immune cells, we identified expression programs in different cell types that co-varied across patient tumors and used spatial profiling to localize coordinated programs. We discovered a myeloid cell-attracting hub at the tumor-luminal interface associated with tissue damage, and an MMRd-enriched immune hub within the tumor, with activated T cells together with malignant and myeloid cells expressing T-cell-attracting chemokines.

However, the biological and functional differences that drive the extent of metastasis are poorly understood. We analyzed primary tumors and paired metastases using a multi-fluorescent lineage-labeled mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) - a tumor type where most patients present with metastases. Genomic and transcriptomic analysis revealed an association between metastatic burden and gene amplification or transcriptional upregulation of MYC and its downstream targets. Functional experiments showed that MYC promotes metastasis by recruiting tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), leading to greater bloodstream intravasation. Consistent with these findings, metastatic progression in human PDAC was associated with activation of MYC signaling pathways and enrichment for MYC amplifications specifically in metastatic patients.

    "abstract": "Vasoconstriction in small arteries and arterioles is known to increase resistance to flow, while vasoconstriction in large arteries and aorta is known to decrease their compliance. Besides this general understanding, there is no systematic documentation on what happens to small artery compliance and large artery resistance during vasoconstriction and the corresponding alterations in vascular pressure. The aim of the study is to assess the effect of adrenaline on goat aortae and small arteries in terms of resistance and compliance.\n\nIsolated goat aortae and small arteries were perfused with a pulsatile pump and lumen pressure was recorded before and after addition of adrenaline. In the aortae, systolic pressure increased, diastolic pressure decreased, pulse pressure increased (p = 0.018, WSR); but the mean pressure remained the same (p = 0.357, WSR). Small artery vasoconstriction caused an increase in systolic, diastolic and mean pressures (p = 0.028, WSR). Using length, radius, and thickness data from the tissues and the tubes of the experimental set-up, electrical models were simulated to understand the biological data. The simulations allow us to infer that vasoconstriction in aorta leads to a reduction in compliance, but an increase in resistance if any, is not sufficient to change the mean aortic pressure. On the other hand, vasoconstriction in small arteries increases resistance, but a decrease in compliance if any, does not affect any of the four pressure parameters measured. Vasoconstriction in aorta decreases compliance and therefore increases pulse pressure but does not change resistance significantly enough to alter mean pressure.\n\nKey Points SummaryO_LIThe main aim of the study is to understand where exactly resistance (R) and compliance (C) components of the vasculature occur. There is no definitive evidence for the effect of large artery vasoconstriction on resistance and hence the mean arterial pressure.\nC_LIO_LIThe manuscript presents biological experiments studying the pressure response of goat aorta and small arteries to adrenaline (invitro) and the interpretations using equivalent electrical models.\nC_LIO_LIThe study shows that in aorta and large arteries, vasoconstriction does not lead to a reduction in lumen diameter sufficient to cause a rise in resistance and mean pressure as compared to small arteries.\nC_LIO_LIKnowledge of exact location of R and C in the arterial tree enables re-assessment of the differential action of vasoactive drugs on resistance versus compliance vessels once we resolve beat-to-beat R and C changes in response to a drug. This way antihypertensive therapy can be tailored to address the specific cause of the type of hypertension.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "How animals rewire cellular programs to survive cold is a fascinating problem with potential biomedical implications, ranging from emergency medicine to space travel. Studying a hibernation-like response in the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we uncovered a regulatory axis that enhances the natural resistance of nematodes to severe cold. This axis involves conserved transcription factors, DAF-16/FoxO and PQM-1, which jointly promote cold survival by upregulating FTN-1, a protein related to mammalian Fth1/ferritin. Moreover, we show that inducing expression of Fth1 also promotes cold survival of mammalian neurons, a cell type particularly sensitive to deterioration in hypothermia. Our findings in both animals and cells suggest that FTN-1/Fth1 facilitates cold survival by detoxifying ROS-generating iron species. We finally show that mimicking the effects of FTN-1/Fth1 with drugs protects neurons from cold-induced degeneration, opening a potential avenue to improved treatments of hypothermia.",

    "abstract": "Aegilops tauschii, the diploid wild progenitor of the D-subgenome of bread wheat, constitutes a reservoir of genetic diversity for improving bread wheat performance and environmental resilience. To better define and understand this diversity, we sequenced 242 Ae. tauschii accessions and compared them to the wheat D-subgenome. We characterized a rare, geographically-restricted lineage of Ae. tauschii and discovered that it contributed to the wheat D-subgenome, thereby elucidating the origin of bread wheat from at least two independent hybridizations. We then used k-mer-based association mapping to identify discrete genomic regions with candidate genes for disease and pest resistance and demonstrated their functional transfer into wheat by transgenesis and wide crossing, including the generation of a library of  synthetic hexaploids incorporating diverse Ae. tauschii genomes. This pipeline permits rapid trait discovery in the diploid ancestor through to functional genetic validation in a hexaploid background amenable to breeding.",

    "abstract": "Plants are very effective in responding to environmental changes during competition for light and nutrients. Low Red:Far-Red (low R:FR)-mediated neighbor detection allows plants to compete successfully with other plants for available light. This above-ground signal can also reduce lateral root growth by inhibiting lateral root emergence, a process that might help the plant invest resources in shoot growth. Nitrate is an essential nutrient for plant growth and Arabidopsis thaliana responds to low nitrate conditions by enhancing nutrient uptake and reducing lateral and main root growth. There are indications that low R:FR signaling and low nitrate signaling can affect each other. It is unknown which response is prioritized when low R:FR light- and low nitrate signaling co-occur. We investigated the effect of low nitrate conditions on the low R:FR response of the A. thaliana root system in agar plate media, combined with the application of supplemental Far-Red (FR) light to the shoot. We observed that under low nitrate conditions main and lateral root growth was reduced, but more importantly, that the response of the root system to low R:FR was suppressed. Consistently, a loss-of-function mutant of a nitrate transporter gene NRT2.1 lacked low R:FR-induced lateral root reduction and its root growth was hypersensitive to low nitrate. ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) plays an important role in the root response to low R:FR and we found that it was less sensitive to low nitrate conditions with regards to lateral root growth. In addition, we found that low R:FR increases NRT2.1 expression and that low nitrate enhances HY5 expression. HY5 also affects NRT2.1 expression, however, it depended on the presence of ammonium in which direction this effect was. Replacing part of the nitrogen source with ammonium also removed the effect of low R:FR on the root system, showing that changes in nitrogen sources can be crucial for root plasticity. Together our results show that nitrate signaling can repress low R:FR responses and that this involves signaling via HY5 and NRT2.1.",

    "abstract": "In response to variable light intensity, the pupils reflexively constrict or dilate to maintain a uniform retinal illumination. The pupillary light reflex (PLR) pathway receives projections from two important areas in primates brain that plan rapid saccadic eye-movement - frontal eye field (FEF) and superior colliculus (SC). The speed with which neurons in these areas increase firing rate to a threshold determines latency of a saccade. Micro-stimulation of FEF/SC neurons below this threshold modulates the magnitude of PLR. Nonetheless, how the saccade latency and pupil dynamics are related remains unknown. Our study shows that the appearance of a bright stimulus evokes pupil constriction at higher rate when the latency of impending saccade to the stimulus is shorter. This inverse relationship between the rate of pupil constriction and the saccade latency is robust irrespective of the reward outcome. In a homeomorphic biomechanical model of pupil, we have projected build-up signal similar to FEF and SC activity to the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the PLR pathway, respectively. Model simulation mimics the observed data to indicate that the FEF and SC activity for eye movement modulates autonomic input to the pupillary muscle plant. A striking similarity between the dynamics of pupil constriction and stochastic rise in neural activity for saccade elicitation suggests that PLR is a potential proxy of movement preparation, and not mere an indicator of attentional orientation. Our study suggests a mechanism of how the retinal luminosity is timely regulated to aid perception by minimizing visual transients due to gaze orientation.",

    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is caused by an expanded polyglutamine mutation in huntingtin (mHTT), which promotes a prominent atrophy in the striatum and subsequent psychiatric, cognitive, and choreiform movements. Multiple lines of evidence point to an association between HD and aberrant striatal mitochondrial functions. However, present knowledge about whether (or how) mitochondrial mRNA translation is differentially regulated in HD remains unclear. We have recently applied ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq), a technique based on the high-throughput sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments, to analyze detailed snapshots of ribosome occupancy of the mitochondrial mRNA transcripts in control and HD striatal cells. Ribo-seq data revealed almost unaltered ribosome occupancy on the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial transcripts involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and only a mild reduction in ribosome occupancy on a few selected transcripts (SHDA, Ndufv1, Timm23, Tomm5, and Mrps22) in HD cells. By contrast, ribosome occupancy of mitochondrially encoded OXPHOS mRNAs (mtNd-1, mtNd-2, mtNd-4, mtNd-4l, mtNd-5, mtNd-6, mt-Co1, mtCyt b, and mt-ATP8) was dramatically increased, implying widespread dichotomous effects on ribosome occupancy and OXPHOS mRNA translation in HD. Thus, mHTT may command signals that specifically regulate translation of the mitochondrial OXPHOS transcripts and influence HD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Heightened reliance on the cerebral cortex for postural stability with aging is well-known, yet the cortical dynamics of balance control, particularly in relationship to balance function, is unclear. Here we aimed to investigate motor cortical activity in relationship to the level of balance challenge presented during reactive balance recovery, and identify circuit-specific interactions between motor cortex and prefrontal or somatosensory regions to metrics of balance function that predict fall risk. Using electroencephalography, we assessed motor cortical beta power, and beta coherence during balance reactions to perturbations in older adults. We found that individuals with greater somatosensory-motor beta coherence at baseline and lower beta power evoked over motor regions following perturbations demonstrated higher general clinical balance function. At the group-level, beta coherence between prefrontal-motor regions reduced during balance reactions. Older adults with the highest post-perturbation prefrontal-motor coherence showed greater cognitive dual-task interference and elicited stepping reactions at lower perturbation magnitudes. Our results support motor cortical beta activity as a potential biomarker for individual level of balance challenge and implicate prefrontal-and somatosensory-motor cortical networks in different aspects of balance control in older adults. Cortical network activity during balance may provide a neural target for precision-medicine efforts aimed at fall-prevention with aging.",

Here, we show that loss of DHCR7 causes accumulation of 7-DHC-derived oxysterol metabolites, premature neurogenesis, and perturbation of neuronal localization in developing murine or human cortical neural precursors, both in vitro and in vivo. We found that a major oxysterol, 3{beta},5-dihydroxycholest-7-en-6-one (DHCEO), mediates these effects by initiating crosstalk between glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and neurotrophin receptor kinase TrkB. Either loss of DHCR7 or direct exposure to DHCEO causes hyperactivation of GR and TrkB and their downstream MEK-ERK-C/EBP signaling pathway in cortical neural precursors. Moreover, direct inhibition of GR activation with an antagonist or inhibition of DHCEO accumulation with antioxidants rescues the premature neurogenesis phenotype caused by the loss of DHCR7. These results suggest that GR could be a new therapeutic target against the neurological defects observed in SLOS.",

As a first foray to make motor learning studies accessible to a larger and more diverse audience, we developed an online, web-based platform (OnPoint) to collect kinematic data, serving as a template for researchers to create their own online sensorimotor control and learning experiments. As a proof-of-concept, we asked if fundamental motor learning phenomena discovered in the lab could be replicated online. In a series of three experiments, we observed a close correspondence between the results obtained online with those previously reported from research conducted in the laboratory. This web-based platform paired with online crowdsourcing can serve as a powerful new method for the study of motor control and learning.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBiological tissues consist of heterogenous populations of cells. Because gene expression patterns from bulk tissue samples reflect the contributions from all cells in the tissue, understanding the contribution of individual cell types to the overall gene expression in the tissue is fundamentally important. We recently developed a computational method, CDSeq, that can simultaneously estimate both sample-specific cell-type proportions and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles using only bulk RNA-Seq counts from multiple samples. Here we present an R implementation of CDSeq (CDSeqR) with significant performance improvement over the original implementation in MATLAB and an added new function to aid cell type annotation. The R package would be of interest for the broader R community.\n\nResultWe developed a novel strategy to substantially improve computational efficiency in both speed and memory usage. In addition, we designed and implemented a new function for annotating the CDSeq estimated cell types using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. This function allows users to readily interpret and visualize the CDSeq estimated cell types. In addition, this new function further allows the users to annotate CDSeq-estimated cell types using marker genes. We carried out additional validations of the CDSeqR software using synthetic, real cell mixtures, and real bulk RNA-seq data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project.\n\nConclusionsThe existing bulk RNA-seq repositories, such as TCGA and GTEx, provide enormous resources for better understanding changes in transcriptomics and human diseases. They are also potentially useful for studying cell-cell interactions in the tissue microenvironment. Bulk level analyses neglect tissue heterogeneity, however, and hinder investigation of a cell-type-specific expression. The CDSeqR package may aid in silico dissection of bulk expression data, enabling researchers to recover cell-type-specific information.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark neuronal correlate of working memory (WM) is stimulus-selective spiking activity of neurons in prefrontal cortex (PFC) during mnemonic delays. These observations have motivated an influential computational modeling framework in which WM is supported by persistent activity. Recently this framework has been challenged by arguments that observed persistent activity may be an artifact of trial-averaging, which potentially masks high variability of delay activity at the single-trial level. In an alternative scenario, WM delay activity could be encoded in bursts of selective neuronal firing which occur intermittently across trials. However, this alternative proposal has not been tested on single-neuron spike-train data. Here, we developed a framework for addressing this issue by characterizing the trial-to-trial variability of neuronal spiking quantified by Fano factor (FF). By building a doubly stochastic Poisson spiking model, we first demonstrated that the burst-coding proposal implies a significant increase in FF positively correlated with firing rate, and thus loss of stability across trials during the delay. Simulation of spiking cortical circuit WM models further confirmed that FF is a sensitive measure that can well dissociate distinct WM mechanisms. We then tested these predictions on datasets of single-neuron recordings from macaque prefrontal cortex during three WM tasks. In sharp contrast to the burst-coding model predictions, we only found a small fraction of neurons showing increased WM-dependent burstiness, and stability across trials during delay was strengthened in empirical data. Therefore, reduced trial-to-trial variability during delay provides strong constraints on the contribution of single-neuron intermittent bursting to WM maintenance.\n\nSignificance StatementThere are diverging classes of theoretical models explaining how information is maintained in working memory by cortical circuits. In an influential model class, neurons fire exhibit persistent elevated memorandum-selective firing, whereas a recently developed class of burst-coding models suggests that persistent activity is an artifact of trial-averaging, and spiking is sparse in each single trial, subserved by brief intermittent bursts. However, this alternative picture has not been characterized or tested on empirical spike-train data. Here we combine mathematical analysis, computational model simulation and experimental data analysis to test empirically theses two classes of models and show that the trial-to-trial variability of empirical spike trains is not consistent with burst coding. These findings provide constraints for theoretical models of working memory.",

    "abstract": "Synapse loss correlates with cognitive decline in Alzheimers disease (AD), and soluble amyloid beta (A{beta}) is implicated in synaptic dysfunction and loss. An important knowledge gap is the lack of understanding of how synaptic accumulation of A{beta} leads to synapse degeneration. In particular, there has been difficulty in determining whether there is a synaptic receptor that binds A{beta} and mediates toxicity. While many candidate synaptic binding partners have been observed in model systems, their relevance to human AD brain remains unknown. This is in part due to methodological limitations preventing visualization of A{beta} binding at individual synapses. To overcome this limitation, we combined two high resolution microscopy techniques: array tomography and Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to image over 1 million individual synaptic terminals in temporal cortex from AD (n=9) and age matched control cases (n=6). Within postsynaptic densities, A{beta} generates a FRET signal with transmembrane protein 97 (TMEM97), recently discovered to be the Sigma-2 receptor, cellular prion protein, and postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95). TMEM97 is also present in a higher proportion of postsynapses in AD brain compared to control. Further, we inhibited A{beta}-TMEM97 interaction in the APP/PS1+Tau mouse model of AD by treating with the Sigma-2 receptor complex allosteric antagonist CT1812 (n=20) or vehicle (n=20). CT1812 drug concentration correlated negatively with synaptic FRET signal between TMEM97 and A{beta}. These data support a role for TMEM97 in the synaptic binding of A{beta} in human Alzheimers disease brain where it may mediate synaptotoxicity.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryIn Alzheimers disease, TMEM97 was present in a higher proportion of synapses and close enough to amyloid beta to be a potential synaptic binding partner.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 vaccines based on the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been developed that appear to be largely successful in stopping infection. However, vaccine escape variants might arise leading to a re-emergence of COVID. In anticipation of such a scenario, the identification of repurposed drugs that stop SARS-CoV-2 replication could have enormous utility in stemming the disease. Here, using a nano-luciferase tagged version of the virus (SARS-CoV-2- DOrf7a-NLuc) to quantitate viral load, we evaluated a range of human cell types for their ability to be infected and support replication of the virus, and performed a screen of 1971 FDA-approved drugs. Hepatocytes, kidney glomerulus, and proximal tubule cells were particularly effective in supporting SARS-CoV-2 replication, which is in- line with reported proteinuria and liver damage in patients with COVID-19. We identified 35 drugs that reduced viral replication in Vero and human hepatocytes when treated prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection and found amodiaquine, atovaquone, bedaquiline, ebastine, LY2835219, manidipine, panobinostat, and vitamin D3 to be effective in slowing SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells when used to treat infected cells. In conclusion, our study has identified strong candidates for drug repurposing, which could prove powerful additions to the treatment of COVID.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 viral genome contains a positive-strand single-stranded RNA of ~30 kb. Human ACE2 protein is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 virus attachment and initiation of infection. We propose to use ribonucleases (RNases) as antiviral agents to destroy the viral genome in vitro. In the virions the RNA is protected by viral capsid proteins, membrane proteins and nucleocapsid proteins. To overcome this protection we set out to construct RNase fusion with human ACE2 receptor N-terminal domain (ACE2NTD). We constructed six proteins expressed in E. coli cells: 1) MBP-ACE2NTD, 2) ACE2NTD-GFP, 3) RNase I (6xHis), 4) RNase III (6xHis), 5) RNase I-ACE2NTD (6xHis), and 6) human RNase A-ACE2NTD150 (6xHis). We evaluated fusion expression in different E. coli strains, partially purified MBP-ACE2NTD protein from the soluble fraction of bacterial cell lysate, and refolded MBP-ACE2NTD protein from inclusion body. The engineered RNase I-ACE2NTD (6xHis) and hRNase A-ACE2NTD (6xHis) fusions are active in cleaving COVID-19 RNA in vitro. The recombinant RNase I (6xHis) and RNase III (6xHis) are active in cleaving RNA and dsRNA in test tube. This study provides a proof-of-concept for construction of fusion protein between human cell receptor and nuclease that may be used to degrade viral nucleic acids in our environment.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=132 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/429007v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b966e0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1111393org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c4cc2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f35dd7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Cartoon illustration part of this work (Human ACE2 N-terminal domain tethered to RNase A and RNA degradation by the fusion enzyme).\n\nC_FIG",

For SARS-CoV-2, RNA capping includes 2'-O-methylation of the first ribonucleotide by methyltransferase nsp16 in complex with activator nsp10. The reaction requires substrates, a short RNA and SAM, and is catalyzed by divalent cations, with preference for Mn2+. Crystal structures of nsp16-nsp10 with capped RNAs revealed a critical role of metal ions in stabilizing interactions between ribonucleotides and nsp16, resulting in precise alignment of the substrates for methyl transfer. An aspartate residue that is highly conserved among coronaviruses alters the backbone conformation of the capped RNA in the binding groove. This aspartate is absent in mammalian methyltransferases and is a promising site for designing coronavirus-specific inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses could pose unpredictable risks to health systems globally, with recent studies suggesting more severe disease outcomes in co-infected patients. The lack of a readily available COVID-19 vaccine has reinforced the importance of influenza vaccine programmes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) is an important tool in protecting against influenza, particularly in children. However, it is unknown whether LAIV administration might influence the outcomes of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection or disease. To investigate this, quadrivalent LAIV (QLAIV) was administered to ferrets 3 days pre- or post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. LAIV administration did not exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 disease course or lung pathology with either regimen. Additionally, LAIV administered prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication and shedding in the upper respiratory tract (URT). We conclude that LAIV administration in close proximity to SARS-CoV-2 infection does not exacerbate mild disease and can reduce SARS-CoV-2 shedding.",

    "abstract": "In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, repurposing of drugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections is being explored. The HIV protease inhibitor Nelfinavir, widely prescribed in combination with other HIV inhibitors, has been shown to inhibit in vitro SARS-CoV-2 replication. We here report on the effect of Nelfinavir in the Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 infection model. Although treatment of infected hamsters with either 15 or 50 mg/kg BID Nelfinavir [for four consecutive days, initiated on the day of infection] does not reduce viral RNA loads nor infectious virus titres in the lungs compared to the vehicle control, the drug reduced virus-induced lung pathology to nearly the baseline scores of healthy animals. A substantial interstitial infiltration of neutrophils is observed in the lungs of treated (both infected and uninfected) animals. The protective effect of Nelfinavir on SARS-CoV-2-induced lung pathology (at doses that are well tolerated and that result in exposures nearing those observed in HIV-infected patients) may lay the foundation for clinical studies with this widely used drug.",

Since BM proteins form networks, they likely need to be secreted near the basal surface. However, the location of their secretion site and how it is selected are unknown. Working in the Drosophila follicular epithelium, we identified two kinesins essential for normal BM formation. Our data suggest the two kinesins work together to transport Rab10+ BM protein-filled secretory vesicles towards the basal surface along the polarized microtubule array common to epithelia. This kinesin transport biases BM protein secretion basally. When kinesins are depleted, BM proteins are mis-secreted to more apical regions of the lateral membrane, creating ectopic BM protein networks between cells that disrupt cell movements and tissue architecture. These results introduce a new transport step in the BM protein secretion pathway and highlight the importance of controlling the sub-cellular exocytic site of network-forming proteins.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA kinesin-3 and a kinesin-1 are required for normal basement membrane (BM) assembly\nC_LIO_LIKinesins move Rab10+ BM secretory vesicles basally on polarized microtubule arrays\nC_LIO_LITransport biases BM exocytosis to basal subregions of the basolateral membrane\nC_LIO_LILoss of kinesins creates ectopic BM networks that disrupt tissue architecture\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The novel {beta}-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected more than 101 million people and resulted in 2.2 million death worldwide. Recent epidemiological studies suggested that some environmental factors, such as air pollution, might be the important contributors to the mortality of COVID-19. However, how environmental exposure enhances the severity of COVID-19 remains to be fully understood. In the present report, we provide evidence showing that mdig, a previously reported environmentally-induced oncogene that antagonizes repressive trimethylation of histone proteins, is a master regulator for SARS-CoV-2 receptors neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and NRP2, cathepsins, glycan metabolism and inflammation, key determinants for viral infection and cytokine storm of the patients. Depletion of mdig in bronchial epithelial cells by CRISPR-Cas-9 gene editing resulted in a decreased expression of NRP1, NRP2, cathepsins, and genes involved in protein glycosylation and inflammation, largely due to a substantial enrichment of lysine 9 and/or lysine 27 trimethylation of histone H3 (H3K9me3/H3K27me3) on these genes as determined by ChIP-seq. These data, accordingly, suggest that mdig is a key mediator for the severity of COVID-19 in response to environmental exposure and targeting mdig may be one of the effective strategies in ameliorating the symptom and reducing the mortality of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Three pathogenic human coronaviruses have emerged within the last 20 years, with SARS-CoV-2 causing a global pandemic. Although therapeutic antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike currently focus on the poorly conserved receptor-binding domain, targeting essential neutralizing epitopes on the more conserved S2 domain may provide broader protection. We report an antibody binding an epitope conserved in the pre-fusion core of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike S2 domains. Antibody 3A3 binds a conformational epitope with ~2.5 nM affinity and neutralizes spike from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern in in vitro pseudovirus assays. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry identified residues 980-1006 in the flexible hinge region at the S2 apex as the 3A3 epitope, suggesting 3A3 prevents the S2 conformational rearrangements required for conversion to the spike post-fusion state and virus-host cell fusion. This work defines a conserved vulnerable site on the SARS-CoV-2 S2 domain and guides the design of pan-protective spike immunogens.",

    "abstract": "The neuropeptide galanin is reported to attenuate opioid withdrawal symptoms, potentially by reducing neuronal hyperactivity in the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) via galanin receptor 1 (GalR1). We evaluated this mechanism by using RNAscope in situ hybridization to characterize GalR1 mRNA distribution in the dorsal pons and to compare galanin and GalR1 mRNA expression in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) LC cells at baseline and following chronic morphine or precipitated withdrawal. We then used genetically altered mouse lines and pharmacology to test whether noradrenergic galanin (NE-Gal) modulates withdrawal symptoms. RNAscope revealed that, while GalR1 signal was abundant in the dorsal pons, 80.7% of the signal was attributable to TH-neurons outside the LC. Galanin and TH mRNA were abundant in LC cells at baseline and were further increased by withdrawal, whereas low basal GalR1 mRNA expression was unaltered by chronic morphine or withdrawal. Naloxone-precipitated withdrawal symptoms in mice lacking NE-Gal (GalcKO-Dbh) were largely similar to WT littermates, indicating that loss of NE-Gal does not exacerbate withdrawal. Complimentary experiments using NE-Gal overexpressor mice (NE-Gal OX) and systemic administration of the galanin receptor agonist galnon revealed that increasing galanin signaling also failed to alter behavioral withdrawal, while suppressing noradrenergic transmission with the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine attenuated multiple symptoms. These results indicate that galanin does not acutely attenuate precipitated opioid withdrawal via an LC-specific mechanism, which has important implications for the general role of galanin in regulation of somatic and affective opioid responses and LC activity.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila melanogaster is a leading model in population genetics and genomics, and a growing number of whole-genome datasets from natural populations of this species have been published over the last 20 years. A major challenge is the integration of these disparate datasets, often generated using different sequencing technologies and bioinformatic pipelines, which hampers our ability to address questions about the evolution and population structure of this species. Here we address these issues by developing a bioinformatics pipeline that maps pooled sequencing (Pool-Seq) reads from D. melanogaster to a hologenome consisting of fly and symbiont genomes and estimates allele frequencies using either a heuristic (PoolSNP) or a probabilistic variant caller (SNAPE-pooled). We use this pipeline to generate the largest data repository of genomic data available for D. melanogaster to date, encompassing 271 population samples from over 100 locations in >20 countries on four continents based on a combination of 121 unpublished and 150 previously published genomic datasets. Several of these locations have been sampled at different seasons across multiple years. This dataset, which we call Drosophila Evolution over Space and Time (DEST), is coupled with sampling and environmental meta-data. A web-based genome browser and web portal provide easy access to the SNP dataset. Our aim is to provide this scalable platform as a community resource which can be easily extended via future efforts for an even more extensive cosmopolitan dataset. Our resource will enable population geneticists to analyze spatio-temporal genetic patterns and evolutionary dynamics of D. melanogaster populations in unprecedented detail.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial ribosomes are specialized to translate the 13 membrane proteins encoded in the mitochondrial genome, which shapes the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes essential for cellular energy metabolism. Despite the importance of mitochondrial translation control, it is challenging to identify and quantify the mitochondrial-encoded proteins due to their hydrophobic nature and low abundance. Here, we introduce a mass spectrometry-based proteomic method that combines biochemical isolation of mitochondria with pulse stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (pSILAC). Our method provides the highest protein identification rate with the shortest measurement time among currently available methods, enabling us to quantify 12 out of the 13 mitochondrial-encoded proteins. We applied this method to uncover the global picture of (post-)translational regulation of both mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded subunits of OXPHOS complexes. We found that inhibition of mitochondrial translation led to degradation of orphan nuclear-encoded subunits that are considered to form subcomplexes with the mitochondrial-encoded subunits. The results also allowed us to infer the subcomplex members of each OXPHOS complex. This method should be readily applicable to study mitochondrial translation programs in many contexts, including oxidative stress and mitochondrial disease.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through its viral spike protein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the host cells. Here we show functionalized nanoparticles, termed \"Nanotraps\", completely inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the interaction between the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2 of host cells. The liposomal-based Nanotrap surfaces were functionalized with either recombinant ACE2 proteins or anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and phagocytosis-specific phosphatidylserines. The Nanotraps effectively captured SARS-CoV-2 and completely blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection to ACE2-expressing human cell lines and primary lung cells; the phosphatidylserine triggered subsequent phagocytosis of the virus-bound, biodegradable Nanotraps by macrophages, leading to the clearance of pseudotyped and authentic virus in vitro. Furthermore, the Nanotraps demonstrated excellent biosafety profile in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the Nanotraps inhibited pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection in live human lungs in an ex vivo lung perfusion system. In summary, Nanotraps represent a new nanomedicine for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nHighlightsO_LINanotraps block interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and host ACE2 receptors\nC_LIO_LINanotraps trigger macrophages to engulf and clear virus without becoming infected\nC_LIO_LINanotraps showed excellent biosafety profiles in vitro and in vivo\nC_LIO_LINanotraps blocked infection to living human lungs in ex vivo lung perfusion system\nC_LI\n\nProgress and PotentialTo address the global challenge of creating treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we devised a nanomedicine termed \"Nanotraps\" that can completely capture and eliminate the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Nanotraps integrate protein engineering, immunology, and nanotechnology and are effective, biocompatible, safe, stable, feasible for mass production. The Nanotraps have the potential to be formulated into a nasal spray or inhaler for easy administration and direct delivery to the respiratory system, or as an oral or ocular liquid, or subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection to target different sites of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, thus offering flexibility in administration and treatment. More broadly, the highly versatile Nanotrap platform could be further developed into new vaccines and therapeutics against a broad range of diseases in infection, autoimmunity and cancer, by incorporating with different small molecule drugs, RNA, DNA, peptides, recombinant proteins, and antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Reports have proposed a putative role for {beta}V spectrin in outer hair cells (OHCs) of the cochlea. In an ongoing investigation of the role of the cytoskeleton in electromotility, we tested mice with a targeted exon deletion of {beta}V spectrin (Spnb5), and unexpectedly find that Spnb5(-/-) animals auditory thresholds are unaffected. Similarly, these mice have normal OHC electromechanical activity (otoacoustic emissions) and non-linear capacitance. In contrast, magnitudes of auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave 1-amplitudes are significantly reduced. Evidence of a synaptopathy was absent with normal hair cell CtBP2 counts. In Spnb5(-/-) mice, the number of afferent and efferent nerve fibers is decreased. Consistent with this data, Spnb5 mRNA is present in Type I and II spiral ganglion neurons, but undetectable in OHCs. Together, these data establish that {beta}V spectrin is important for hearing, affecting neuronal structure and function. Significantly, these data exclude {beta}V spectrin as functionally important to OHCs as has been previously suggested.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRigorous preclinical studies of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) immunotherapy will require large quantities of consistent and high-quality CAR-transduced T (CART)-cells that can be used in syngeneic mouse glioblastoma (GBM) models. To this end, we developed a novel transgenic (Tg) mouse strain with a fully murinized CAR targeting epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII).\n\nMethodsWe first established the murinized version of EGFRvIII-CAR and validated its function using a retroviral vector (RV) in C57BL/6J mice bearing syngeneic SB28 GBM expressing EGFRvIII. Next, we created C57BL/6J-background Tg mice carrying the anti-EGFRvIII-CAR downstream of a Lox-Stop-Lox cassette in the Rosa26 locus. We bred these mice with CD4-Cre Tg mice to allow CAR expression on T-cells and evaluated the function of the CART-cells both in vitro and in vivo. In order to inhibit immunosuppressive myeloid cells within SB28 GBM, we also evaluated a combination approach of CART and an anti-EP4 compound (ONO-AE3-208).\n\nResultsBoth RV- and Tg-CART-cells demonstrated specific cytotoxic activities against SB28-EGFRvIII cells. A single intravenous infusion of EGFRvIII-CART-cells prolonged the survival of glioma-bearing mice when preceded by a lymphodepletion regimen with recurrent tumors displaying profound EGFRvIII loss. The addition of ONO-AE3-208 resulted in long-term survival in a fraction of CART-treated mice and those survivors demonstrated delayed growth of subcutaneously re-challenged both EGFRvIII+ and parental EGFRvIII- SB28.\n\nConclusionOur new syngeneic CAR Tg mouse model can serve as a useful tool to address clinically relevant questions and develop future immunotherapeutic strategies.\n\nImportance of studyThe majority of preclinical studies evaluating CART therapy for GBM have utilized xenografts implanted into immunocompromised mice. Because the successful development of these strategies will depend on the understanding of critical interactions between therapeutic cells and the endogenous immune environment, it is essential to develop a novel immunocompetent system which allows us to study these interactions in a robust and reproducible manner. To this end, we created a Tg mouse strain in which all T-cells express a murinized EGFRvIII-CAR. T-cells derived from these mice demonstrated consistent CAR expression and EGFRvIII-specific cytotoxicity while traditional transduction with a CAR vector showed batch-to-batch variability. The syngeneic system also gave us the opportunity to evaluate a combination regimen with blockade of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. The Tg-CART mice represent a novel system for robust, and reproducible preclinical investigations.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) calls for an urgent development of effective and safe prophylactic and therapeutic measures. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) glycoprotein is a major immunogenic and protective protein, and plays a crucial role in viral pathogenesis. In this study, we successfully constructed a synthetic codon-optimized DNA-based vaccine as a countermeasure against SARS-CoV-2; denoted as VIU-1005. The design was based on the synthesis of codon-optimized coding sequence for optimal mammalian expression of a consensus full-length S glycoprotein. The successful construction of the vaccine was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing, and the protein expression of the S protein was confirmed by western blot and immunofluorescence staining in mammalian cells. The immunogenicity of the vaccine was tested in two mouse models (BALB/c and C57BL/6J). Th1-skewed systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were significantly induced in both models four weeks post three injections with 100 g of the VIU-1005 vaccine via intramuscular needle injection but not intradermal or subcutaneous routes. Importantly, such immunization induced long-lasting IgG response in mice that lasted for at least 6 months. Interestingly, using a needle-free system, we showed an enhanced immunogenicity of VIU-1005 in which lower doses such as 25-50 g or less number of doses were able to elicit significantly high levels of Th1-biased systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and nAbs via intramuscular immunization compared to needle immunization. Compared to the intradermal needle injection which failed to induce any significant immune response, intradermal needle-free immunization elicited robust Th1-biased humoral response similar to that observed with intramuscular immunization. Furthermore, immunization with VIU-1005 induced potent S-specific cellular response as demonstrated by the significantly high levels of IFN-{gamma}, TNF and IL-2 cytokines production in memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in BALB/c mice. Together, our results demonstrate that the synthetic VIU-1005 candidate DNA vaccine is highly immunogenic and capable of inducing long-lasting and Th1-skewed immune response in mice. Furthermore, we show that the use of needle-free system could enhance the immunogenicity and minimize doses needed to induce protective immunity in mice, supporting further preclinical and clinical testing of this candidate vaccine.",

    "abstract": "Lipolytic enzymes are one of the most important enzyme types for application in various industrial processes. Despite the continuously increasing demand, only a small portion of the so far encountered lipolytic enzymes exhibit adequate stability and activities for biotechnological applications. To explore novel and/or extremophilic lipolytic enzymes, microbial consortia in two composts at thermophilic stage were analyzed using function-driven and sequence-based metagenomic approaches. Analysis of community composition by amplicon-based 16S rRNA genes and transcripts, and direct metagenome sequencing revealed that the communities of the compost samples were dominated by members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Chloroflexi. Function-driven screening of the metagenomic libraries constructed from the two samples yielded 115 unique genes encoding lipolytic enzymes. The family assignment of these enzymes was conducted by analyzing the phylogenetic relationship and generation of a protein sequence similarity network according to an integral classification system. The sequence-based screening was performed by using a newly developed database, containing a set of profile Hidden Markov models, highly sensitive and specific for detection of lipolytic enzymes. By comparing the lipolytic enzymes identified through both approaches, we demonstrated that the activity-directed complements sequence-based detection, and vice versa. The sequence-based comparative analysis of lipolytic genes regarding diversity, function and taxonomic origin derived from 175 metagenomes indicated significant differences between habitats. Analysis of the prevalent and distinct microbial groups providing the lipolytic genes revealed characteristic patterns and groups driven by ecological factors. The here presented data suggests that the diversity and distribution of lipolytic genes in metagenomes of various habitats are largely constrained by ecological factors.",

    "abstract": "Cells can use self recognition to achieve cooperative behaviors. Self-recognition genes principally evolve in tandem with partner self-recognition alleles. However, other constraints on protein evolution could exist. Here, we have identified an interaction outside of self-recognition loci that could constrain the sequence variation of a self-recognition protein. We show that during collective swarm expansion in Proteus mirabilis, self-recognition signaling co-opts SdaC, a serine transporter. Serine uptake is crucial for bacterial survival and colonization. Single-residue variants of SdaC reveal that self recognition requires an open conformation of the protein; serine transport is dispensable. A distant ortholog from Escherichia coli is sufficient for self recognition; however, a homologous serine transporter, YhaO, is not. Thus, SdaC couples self recognition and serine transport, likely through a shared molecular interface. Understanding molecular and ecological constraints on self-recognition proteins can provide insights into the evolution of self recognition and emergent collective behaviors.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=119 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/428846v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (14K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17dbf8eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ab0faeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9289adorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8ccc89_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

To further optimize strain productivity, a systems level understanding of its metabolism is needed, which can be facilitated by a genome-scale metabolic model. Here, we present p-thermo, the most complete, curated and validated genome-scale model (to date) of Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius NCIMB 11955. It spans a total of 890 metabolites, 1175 reactions and 917 metabolic genes, forming an extensive knowledge base for P. thermoglucosidasius NCIMB 11955 metabolism. The model accurately predicts aerobic utilization of 22 carbon sources, and the predictive quality of internal fluxes was validated with previously published 13C-fluxomics data. In an application case, p-thermo was used to facilitate more in-depth analysis of reported metabolic engineering efforts, giving additional insight into fermentative metabolism. Finally, p-thermo was used to resolve a previously uncharacterised bottleneck in anaerobic metabolism, by identifying the minimal required supplemented nutrients (thiamin, biotin and iron(III)) needed to sustain anaerobic growth. This highlights the usefulness of p-thermo for guiding the generation of experimental hypotheses and for facilitating data-driven metabolic engineering, expanding the use of P. thermoglucosidasius as a high yield production platform.",

Although molecules like the ArSulfs, which interfere with splicing decisions, are exciting potential medicines, the molecular glue mechanism of RBM39 degradation introduces complex pleiotropic effects that are difficult to untangle. For example, DCAF15 inhibition, RBM39 degradation, and the downstream proteome effects of splicing changes will all cause different yet overlaid effects. As such the precise cell-killing mechanism by RBM39 loss is largely unknown. By overlaying transcriptome and proteome datasets, we distinguish transcriptional from post-transcriptional effects, pinpointing those proteins most impacted by splicing changes. Our proteomic profiling of several ArSulfs suggests a selective DCAF15/ArylSulf/RBM39RRM2 interaction with a narrow degradation profile. We identify two mitotic kinesin motor proteins that are aberrantly spliced upon RBM39 degradation, and we demonstrate that these are likely contributors to the antiproliferative activity of ArSulfs.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are increasingly recognized as signaling organelles because, under conditions of stress, mitochondria can trigger various signaling pathways to coordinate the cells response. The specific pathway(s) engaged by mitochondria in response to defects in mitochondrial energy production in vivo and in high-energy tissues like the heart are not fully understood. Here, we investigated cardiac pathways activated in response to mitochondrial energy dysfunction by studying mice with cardiomyocyte-specific loss of the mitochondrial phosphate carrier (SLC25A3), an established model that develops cardiomyopathy as a result of defective mitochondrial ATP synthesis. In heart tissue from these mice, mitochondrial energy dysfunction induced a striking pattern of acylome remodeling, with significantly increased post-translational acetylation and malonylation. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics further revealed that energy dysfunction-induced remodeling of the acetylome and malonylome preferentially impacts mitochondrial proteins. Acetylation and malonylation modified a highly interconnected interactome of mitochondrial proteins, and both modifications were present on the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2). Intriguingly, IDH2 activity was enhanced in SLC25A3-deleted mitochondria, and further study of IDH2 sites targeted by both acetylation and malonylation revealed that these modifications can have site-specific and distinct functional effects. Finally, we uncovered a novel crosstalk between the two modifications, whereby mitochondrial energy dysfunction-induced acetylation of sirtuin 5 (SIRT5), inhibited its function. Because SIRT5 is a mitochondrial deacylase with demalonylase activity, this finding suggests that acetylation can modulate the malonylome. Together, our results position acylations as an arm of the mitochondrial response to energy dysfunction and suggest a mechanism by which focal disruption to the mitochondrial energy production machinery can have an expanded impact on global mitochondrial function.",

In order to improve such predictions, we hypothesize that the severity of epidemics can be linked to viral evolutionary dynamics. More specifically, we posit the existence of a negative association between patients health and the stability of coevolutionary networks at key viral proteins. To test this, we performed a thorough evolutionary analysis of influenza viruses circulating in continental US between 2010 and 2019, assessing how measures of the stability of these coevolutionary networks correlate with clinical data based on outpatient healthcare visits showing Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) symptoms. We first show evidence of a significant correlation between viral evolutionary dynamics and increased influenza activity during seasonal epidemics, and then show that these dynamics closely follow the progression of epidemics through each season, providing us with predictive power based on genetic data collected between week 20 and week 40/52, that is one to fifteen weeks prior to peak ILI. Viral evolutionary dynamics may hence be used by health authorities to further guide non-pharmaceutical interventions.",

The GOLPH3 gene is part of a group of genes that also includes the GOLPH3L gene. Because cancer has deep roots in multicellular evolution, studying the evolution of the GOLPH3 gene family in non-model species represents an opportunity to identify new model systems that could help better understand the biology behind this group of genes. The main goal of this study is to explore the evolution of the GOLPH3 gene family in birds as a starting point to understand the evolutionary history of this oncoprotein. We identified a repertoire of three GOLPH3 genes in birds. We found duplicated copies of the GOLPH3 gene in all main groups of birds other than paleognaths, and a single copy of the GOLPH3L gene. We suggest there were at least three independent origins for GOLPH3 duplicates. Amino acid divergence estimates show that most of the variation is located in the N-terminal region of the protein. Our transcript abundance estimations show that one paralog is highly and ubiquitously expressed, and the others were variable. Our results are an example of the significance of understanding the evolution of the GOLPH3 gene family, especially for unraveling its structural and functional attributes.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomal proteins (RPs) are highly conserved across the bacterial and archaeal domains. Although many RPs are essential for survival, genome analysis demonstrates the absence of some RP genes in many bacterial and archaeal genomes. Furthermore, global transposon mutagenesis and/or targeted deletion showed that elimination of some RP genes had only a moderate effect on the bacterial growth rate. Here, we systematically analyze the evolutionary conservation of RPs in prokaryotes by compiling the list of the ribosomal genes that are missing from the one or more genomes in the recently updated version of the Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG) database. Some of these absences occurred because the respective genes carried frameshifts, presumably, resulting from sequencing errors, while others were overlooked and not translated during genome annotation. Apart from these annotation errors, we identified multiple genuine losses of RP genes in a variety of bacteria and archaea. Some of these losses are clade-specific, whereas others occur in symbionts and parasites with dramatically reduced genomes. The lists of computationally and experimentally defined non-essential ribosomal genes show a substantial overlap, revealing a common trend in prokaryote ribosome evolution that could be linked to the architecture and assembly of the ribosomes. Thus, RPs that are located at the surface of the ribosome and/or are incorporated at a late stage of ribosome assembly are more likely to be non-essential and to be lost during microbial evolution, particularly, in the course of genome compaction.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn many prokaryote genomes, one or more ribosomal protein (RP) genes are missing. Analysis of 1,309 prokaryote genomes included in the COG database shows that only about half of the RPs are universally conserved in bacteria and archaea. In contrast, up to 21 other RPs are missing in some genomes, primarily, tiny (<1 Mb) genomes of host-associated bacteria and archaea. Ten universal and nine archaea-specific ribosomal proteins show clear patterns of lineage-specific gene loss. Most of the RPs that are frequently lost from bacterial genomes are located on the ribosome periphery and are non-essential in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. These results reveal general trends and common constraints in the architecture and evolution of ribosomes in prokaryotes.",

The clear information was not available regarding Silicon nourishment in tree species like Eucalyptus. Although a positive in plant development and overall dry matter production was noticed in Eucalyptus with Si application. The amount of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) were inclined leaf whereas Calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) content was not affected by Si application potassium silicate (K2SiO3). Finally results revealed that upon Si application significant increase in the leaf mineral content in almost all genotypes was recorded.

    "abstract": "Characteristic properties of type III CRISPR-Cas systems include recognition of target RNA (rather than DNA) and the subsequent induction of a multifaceted immune response. This involves sequence-specific cleavage of a target RNA and production of cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) second messenger molecules that may trigger dormancy or cell death. In this study, we discovered that a largely exposed seed region at the 3 end of the crRNA is essential for target RNA binding and cleavage, whereas base pairing at a unique region at the 5 end of the guide is required to trigger cOA production. Moreover, we uncovered that the natural variation in the composition of type III complexes within a single host results in different guide lengths, and hence variable seed regions. This shifting seed may prevent escape by invading genetic elements, while controlling cOA production very tightly to prevent unnecessary damage to the host. Lastly, we used these findings to develop a new diagnostic tool, named SCOPE, which was used for the specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 from human nasal swab samples, showing sensitivities in the atto-molar range.",

    "abstract": "MotivationVirtual screening, which can computationally predict the presence or absence of protein-compound interactions, has attracted attention as a large-scale, low-cost, and short-term search method for seed compounds. Existing machine learning methods for predicting protein-compound interactions are largely divided into those based on molecular structure data and those based on network data. The former utilize information on proteins and compounds, such as amino acid sequences and chemical structures, while the latter utilize interaction network data, such as data on protein-protein interactions and compound-compound interactions. However, few attempts have been made to combine both types of data in molecular information and interaction networks.\n\nResultsWe developed a deep learning-based method that integrates protein features, compound features, and multiple types of interactome data to predict protein-compound interactions. We designed three benchmark datasets with different difficulties and evaluated the performance on them. The performance evaluations show that our deep learning framework for integrating molecular structure data and interactome data outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning methods for protein-compound interaction prediction tasks. The performance improvement is proven to be statistically significant by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. This reveals that the multi-interactome captures different perspectives than amino acid sequence homology and chemical structure similarity, and both type of data have a synergistic effect in improving prediction accuracy. Furthermore, experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our method is more robust than existing methods in accurately predicting interactions between proteins and compounds that are unseen in the training samples.",

    "abstract": "In life sciences, there are increasing interest in 3D culture models to better reproduce the 3D environment encountered in-vivo. Imaging of such 3D culture models is instrumental for drug discovery, but face several issues before its use becomes widespread. Extensive microscopic investigation of these 3D cell models faces the challenge of light penetration in depth in opaque biological tissues. To overcome this limit, diverse clearing techniques have emerged over the past decades. However, it is not straightforward to choose the best clearing protocols, and assess quantitatively their clearing efficiency. Focusing on spheroids, we propose a combination of fast and cost-effective clearing procedure for such medium-sized samples. A generic method with local contrast metrics and deep convolutional neural network-based segmentation of nuclei is proposed to quantify the efficiency of clearing. We challenged this method by testing the possibility to transfer segmentation knowledge from a clearing protocol to another. The later results support the pertinence of training deep learning algorithms on cleared samples to further use the segmentation pipeline on non-cleared ones. This second step of the protocol gives access to digital clearing possibilities applicable to live and high-throughput optical imaging.",

SARM1 is a central executioner of the process of axon degeneration, a common feature of the early phase of a range of neurodegenerative diseases. SARM1 is held in the inactive state in healthy axons by its N-terminal auto-inhibitory ARM domain, and is activated to cleave NAD+ upon injury, triggering the subsequent axon degeneration. To characterize the molecular mechanism of SARM1 activation, we sought to determine the crystal structure of the SARM1 ARM domain. Here we describe the recombinant production and crystallization of dSARM1ARM, as well as unconventional process used for structure determination. Crystals were obtained in the presence of NMN, a precursor of NAD+ and a potential activator of SARM1, only after in situ proteolysis of the N-terminal 63 residues. After molecular replacement attempts failed, we determined the crystal structure of dSARM1ARM at 1.65 [A] resolution using the MIRAS phasing technique with the program autoSHARP, combining data from the native, SeMet-labelled, and Br-soaked crystals. The structure will further our understanding of the regulation of SARM1.",

In the present article, we describe the application of genetically-encoded FRET biosensors with high content microscopy to image the signaling responses of thousands of neurons in response to drug treatments. We applied this approach to reveal intercellular variation in signaling responses among cultured striatal neurons stimulated with multiple drugs. The striatum is largely composed of medium-spiny GABAergic neurons which are divided into two broad sub-types based in part on their expression of dopamine D1 vs. D2 receptors. Using high content FRET imaging and immunofluorescence, we identified neuronal sub-populations with unique responses to pharmacological manipulation. Focusing on dopamine- and glutamate-regulated PKA and ERK1/2 signaling in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, we identified pronounced intercellular differences, in both the magnitude and kinetics of signaling responses to drug application. Importantly, we found that a conventional \"bulk\" analysis that included all cells in culture yielded a different rank order of drug potency than that revealed by our single-cell analysis. The high degree of heterogeneity that we observed at the single cell level would not have been detectable using common population-level analyses, derived for example from western blotting or plate reader-based measurements. In conclusion, our single-cell analytical approach highlights the limitations of population-level analyses, and provides a novel way to study signaling biology.",

However, the cellular substrates of functional network integration are unknown. We leverage a unique cross-scale dataset of therapy-resistant TLE patients, who underwent fMRI, MEG and/or neuropsychological testing before neurosurgery. fMRI and MEG underwent atlas-based connectivity analyses. Functional network centrality of the lateral middle temporal gyrus, part of the DMN, was used as a measure of local network integration. Subsequently, non-pathological cortical tissue from this region was used for single cell morphological and electrophysiological patch-clamp analysis, assessing integration in terms of total dendritic length and action potential rise speed. As could be hypothesized, greater network centrality related to better memory performance. Moreover, greater network centrality correlated with more integrative properties at the cellular level across patients. We conclude that individual differences in cognitively relevant functional network integration of a DMN region are mirrored by differences in cellular integrative properties of this region in TLE patients. These findings connect previously separate scales of investigation, increasing translational insight into focal pathology and large-scale network disturbances in TLE.",

Biodegradation lab tests (20 {degrees}C) were complemented by mesocosm tests (20 {degrees}C) with natural sand and seawater and by field tests in the warm-temperate Mediterranean Sea (12 - 30 {degrees}C) and in tropical Southeast Asia (29 {degrees}C) in three typical coastal scenarios. Plastic film samples were exposed in the eulittoral beach, the pelagic open water and the benthic seafloor and their disintegration monitored over time. We used statistical modelling to predict the half-life for each of the materials under the different environmental conditions to render the experimental results numerically comparable across all experimental conditions applied. The biodegradation performance of the materials differed by orders of magnitude depending on climate, habitat and material and revealed the inaccuracy to generically term a material  marine biodegradable. The half-life t0.5 of a film of PHA with 85 m thickness ranged from 54 d on the seafloor in SE Asia to 1247 d in mesocosm pelagic tests. t0.5 for PBSe (25 m) ranged from 99 d in benthic SE Asia to 2614 d in mesocosm benthic tests, and for PBSeT t0.5 ranged from 147 d in the mesocosm eulittoral to 797 d in Mediterranean benthic field tests. For LDPE no biodegradation could be observed. These data can now be used to estimate the persistence of plastic objects should they end up in the marine environments considered here and will help to inform the life cycle (impact) assessment of plastics in the open environment.",

The Head domain features an unusual and conserved aspartic acid cluster at the trimer interface, which forms the only significant intra-trimer interactions in the Head, and must be protonated to allow trimer formation.\n\nHere we show that all domains of {sigma}1 are remarkably thermostable across a wide range of pH, even at the low pH of the stomach.

The {sigma}1 Head is stable at acidic and neutral pH, but detrimerizes at basic pH. When Asp345 in the aspartic acid cluster is mutated to asparagine, the {sigma}1 Head loses stability at low pH and is more prone to detrimerize.

The acquired form of HO is a debilitating and common complication of musculoskeletal trauma, central nervous system injury, burns, combat trauma, hip and elbow fractures, and total joint replacement surgeries. It can be characterized as abnormal bone formation that occurs mostly by endochondral ossification. Recent studies have implicated inflammation and dysregulation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling as major early contributors to HO formation. Here, we demonstrate that administration of the Hh pathway inhibitor, arsenic trioxide (ATO), prevented acquired HO in a clinically-relevant trauma/burn mouse model. We further evaluated the effects of two additional Hh pathway antagonists: cholecalciferol and pravastatin on mitigating osteoblast differentiation. Finally, we assessed the effect of a combination of Hh pathway inhibitors on reducing systemic proinflammatory responses. A targeted combination approach using Hh pathway inhibitors may offer potential therapeutic benefits though targeting differential components of the Hh pathway. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the administration of single or multiple Hh pathway inhibitors may have the potential to reduce the formation of acquired HO.",

In particular the recently discovered Cas12a systems offer extended potential, as Cas12a is capable of processing its own crRNA array to provide multiple individual crRNAs for subsequent targeting from a single transcript. Here we show the application of dFnCas12a-VPR in mammalian cells, with FnCas12a possessing a shorter PAM sequence than As or Lb variants, enabling denser targeting of genomic loci. We observe that synergistic activation and multiplexing can be achieved using crRNA arrays but also show that crRNAs expressed towards the 5 of 6-crRNA arrays show evidence of enhanced activity. This not only represents a more flexible tool for transcriptional modulation but further expands our understanding of the design capabilities and limitations when considering longer crRNA arrays for multiplexed targeting.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThere has been considerable speculation regarding the potential of PVP-I nasal disinfection as an adjunct to other countermeasures during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Nasodine is a commercial formulation of 0.5% PVP-I that has been evaluated for safety and efficacy in human trials as a treatment for the common cold, including a Phase III trial (ANZCTR: ACTRN12619000764134). This study presents the first report of the in vitro efficacy of this formulation against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nMETHODSWe conducted in vitro experiments to determine if the PVP-I formulation inactivated SARS-CoV-2 using two independent assays and virus isolates, and incorporating both PCR-based detection and cell culture methods to assess residual virus after exposure to the formulation.\n\nRESULTSBased on cell culture results, the PVP-I formulation was found to rapidly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 isolates in vitro in short timeframes (15 seconds to 15 minutes) consistent with the minimum and maximum potential residence time in the nose. The Nasodine formula was found to be more effective than 0.5% PVP-I in saline. Importantly, it was found that the formulation inactivated culturable virus but had no effect on PCR-detectable viral RNA.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThe PVP-I formulation eliminated the viability of SARS-CoV-2 virus with short exposure times consistent with nasal use. PCR alone may not be adequate for viral quantification in nasal PVP-I studies; future studies should incorporate cell culture to assess viral viability. Nasal disinfection with PVP-I may be a useful intervention for newly-diagnosed COVID-19 patients to reduce transmission risk and disease progression to the lower respiratory tract.",

    "abstract": "Germ cells undergo mitotic expansion via incomplete cytokinesis, forming cysts of undifferentiated cells that remain interconnected prior to meiotic initiation, through mechanisms that are not well-defined. In somatic cells, Ras-related nuclear protein (Ran) spatiotemporally regulates mitotic spindle assembly, cleavage furrow formation and abscission. Here, we identify Ran and {beta}-importins as critical regulators of cyst development in the Drosophila ovary. Depletion of Ran or the {beta}-importins Tnpo-SR and cadmus disrupts oocyte selection and results in egg chambers with variable numbers of germ cells, suggesting abnormal cyst development and cyst fragmentation. We demonstrate that Ran, Tnpo-SR, and Cadmus regulate key cellular processes during cyst formation, including cell cycle dynamics, fusome biogenesis, and ring canal stability, yet do so independently of mitotic spindle assembly. Further, Tnpo-SR and Cadmus control cyclin accumulation and suppress cytokinesis independent of Ran-GTP, suggesting that {beta}-importins sequester protein cargos that normally promote the mitotic-to-meiotic transition. Our data demonstrates that Ran and {beta}-importins are critical for germ cell cyst formation, a role that is likely conserved in other organisms.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTRan and two {beta}-importins function coordinately to promote oocyte selection and cyst development in the Drosophila ovary.",

    "abstract": "Temperature plays an important role in determining breeding phenology of temperate birds, with higher spring temperatures associated with earlier breeding. However, the effect of localised territory-scale temperature variations is poorly understood, with relationships between temperature and breeding phenology mostly studied using coarse-grained climatic indices. Here, we interpolate spring temperatures recorded at 150 m2 grid intersections encompassing 417 ha of forest to examine the influence of territory-scale temperature, and its interaction with mean annual temperature, on territory selection, breeding phenology, clutch size and fledgling success for three co-occurring single-brooded passerine birds using data from 672 nests over four years. All species exhibited significant trends in reproductive traits associated with territory-scale temperature. Pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca settled in cooler territories first, where they raised more fledglings. Blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus laid larger clutches in warmer territories in warm years and always laid earlier at warmer territories irrespective of annual temperature variation. Contrastingly, pied flycatcher and wood warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix breeding phenology was earlier at warmer territories in cool years and cooler territories in warm years, with wood warbler clutch size responding similarly to this interaction. Greater previous breeding experience and increased higher rates of historical territory occupancy (territory quality) also predicted earlier breeding phenology and higher fledging success for pied flycatchers. We suggest that the migratory pied flycatcher and wood warbler are best synchronised with their prey availability in cooler years at a local population level while resident blue tits match local phenology across all years, which is potentially advantageous under warmer predicted climate change scenarios. We conclude that temperature at the territory scale can be an important driver of settlement and breeding phenology and influence reproductive traits.",

Six of them (TJP1, PTPN13, HTRA1, PARD3, MLLT4, LNX2) are also recognized by SARS-CoV while three (NHERF1, MAST2, RADIL) are specific to SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Most of these SARS-CoV-2 protein partners are involved in cellular junctions/polarity and could be also linked to evasion mechanisms of the immune responses during viral infection. Seven of the PDZ-containing proteins among binders of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins E, 3a or N affect significantly viral replication under knock-down gene expression in infected cells.

    "abstract": "Small signaling peptides play important roles in various plant processes, but information regarding their involvement in plant immunity is limited. We previously identified a novel small secreted protein in rice, named immune response peptide (IRP) by the integrated multi-omics analyses. Here, we studied IRP functions in rice immunity. Rice plants overexpressing IRP enhanced resistance to the blast fungus. Application of the IRP peptide to rice suspension cells triggered the expression of IRP itself and defense gene PAL1. RNA-seq results revealed that 84% of genes upregulated by IRP peptide were also induced by chitin, including 13 OsWRKY transcription factors, indicating that IRP and chitin share the similar signaling pathway. Co-treatment with chitin and IRP elevated the expression level of PAL1 and OsWRKYs in an additive manner. When results of IRP and PAL1 expression and MAPK activation by IRP were compared with those by chitin, IRP had a stronger effect on MAPK activation rather than IRP and PAL1 expression. Collectively, our findings indicate that IRP functions as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) in rice immunity, regulating MAPKs and OsWRKYs to amplify chitin signaling, and provide new insights into how PAMPs and DAMPs cooperatively regulate rice immunity.",

    "abstract": "Attachment to the intestinal epithelium is critical to the lifestyle of the ubiquitous parasite Giardia lamblia. The microtubule cytoskeleton plays a well characterized role in attachment via the ventral adhesive disc, whereas the role of the unconventional actin cytoskeleton is controversial. We identified a novel actin associated protein with putative WH2-like actin binding domains we named Flangin. Flangin complexes with Giardia actin and is enriched in the ventrolateral flange (VLF), a lamellipodium-like membrane protrusion at the interface between parasites and attached surfaces. Live imaging revealed that the VLF grows to ~1 m in width after cytokinesis, then remains size-uniform in interphase, grows during mitosis, and is resorbed during cytokinesis. A Flangin truncation mutant stabilizes the VLF and blocks cytokinesis, indicating that the VLF is a membrane reservoir supporting rapid myosin-independent cytokinesis in Giardia. Rho family GTPases are important regulators of membrane protrusions, GlRac, the sole Rho family GTPase in Giardia, was localized to the VLF. Knockdown of Flangin, actin, and GlRac result in VLF formation defects indicating a conserved role for GlRac and actin in forming membrane protrusions, despite the absence of canonical actin binding proteins that link Rho GTPase signaling to lamellipodia formation. Flangin-depleted parasites challenged with fluid shear force in flow chambers had a reduced ability to remain attached, indicating a role for the VLF in attachment. This secondary attachment mechanism complements the microtubule based adhesive ventral disc, a feature that is particularly important during mitosis when the parental ventral disc begins disassembly in preparation for cytokinesis.\n\nImportanceThe ventrolateral flange (VLF) is a lamellipodium-like structure found at the host-parasite interface that has long been thought to be involved in parasite attachment. The proteins responsible for building the VLF have remained unidentified precluding manipulation of the VLF to determine its role in Giardia biology. We identified Flangin, a novel actin associated protein that localizes to the VLF, implicating Giardia actin in VLF formation. We demonstrate that: 1.) Flangin, actin, and GlRac are required for VLF formation, 2.) the VLF serves as a membrane reservoir to support Giardias incredibly fast cytokinesis, and 3) the VLF augments attachment, which is critical to parasitism. The microtubule-based adhesive ventral disc and the actin-based ventrolateral flange represent redundant means of maintaining attachment, the presence of redundant systems illustrate the importance of attachment to the lifestyle of this ubiquitous parasite.",

Whether and at what stage neural responses occur to these color associations remain open questions. We tested for frequency-tagged electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to periodic presentations of yellow-associated objects, shown among sequences of non-periodic blue-, red-, and green-associated objects. Both color and grayscale versions of the objects elicited yellow-specific responses, indicating an automatic activation of color knowledge from object shape. Follow-up experiments replicated these effects with green-specific responses, and demonstrated modulated responses for incongruent color-object associations. Importantly, the onset of color-specific responses was as early to grayscale as actually colored stimuli (before 100 ms), the latter additionally eliciting a conventional later response (approximately 140-230 ms) to actual stimulus color. This suggests that the neural representation of familiar objects includes both diagnostic shape and color properties, such that shape can elicit associated color-specific responses before actual color-specific responses occur.",

In the mitochondrial genome of a marine heterotrophic katablepharid protist, we identify a functional type II restriction modification system originating from a horizontal gene transfer event involving bacteria related to flavobacteria. This restriction modification system consists of an HpaII-like endonuclease and a cognate cytosine methyltransferase. We demonstrate that these proteins are functional by heterologous expression in both bacterial and eukaryotic cells. These results suggest that toxin-antitoxin selfish elements, such as restriction modification systems, could be co-opted by eukaryotic genomes to drive uniparental organellar inheritance.",

We investigated the progression of behavioral deficits present in CD (complete deletion) mice, a rodent model of WBS, after chronic treatment with curcumin, verapamil and a combination of both. These compounds have been proven to have beneficial effects over different cognitive aspects of various murine models and thus, may have neuroprotective effects in WBS. Treatment was administered orally dissolved in drinking water. A set of behavioral tests demonstrated the efficiency of combinatorial treatment. Some histological and molecular analyses were performed to analyze the effects of treatment and its underlying mechanism in CD mice. Behavioral improvement correlates with the molecular recovery of several affected pathways regarding MAPK signaling, in tight relation with the control of synaptic transmission. Moreover, CD mice showed an increased activated microglia density in different brain regions, which was prevented by treatment. Therefore, results show that treatment prevented behavioral deficits by recovering altered gene expression in cortex of CD mice, reducing activated microglia and normalizing Bdnf expression levels. These findings unravel the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of this novel treatment on behavioral deficits observed in CD mice, and suggest that the combination of curcumin and verapamil could be a potential candidate to treat the cognitive impairments in WBS patients.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis must be diagnosed quickly to avoid morbidity and mortality. However, the clinical manifestations of sepsis are highly variable and emergency department (ED) clinicians often must make rapid, impactful decisions before laboratory results are known. We previously developed a technique that allows the measurement of the biophysical properties of white blood cells as they are stretched through a microfluidic channel. In this study we describe and validate the resultant output as a model and score - the IntelliSep Index (ISI) - that aids in the diagnosis of sepsis in patients with suspected or confirmed infection from a single blood draw performed at the time of ED presentation. By applying this technique to a high acuity cohort with a 23.5% sepsis incidence (n=307), we defined specific metrics - the aspect ratio and visco-elastic inertial response - that are more sensitive than cell size or cell count in predicting disease severity. The final model was trained and cross-validated on the high acuity cohort, and the performance and generalizability of the model was evaluated on a separate low acuity cohort with a 6.4% sepsis incidence (n=94) and healthy donors (n=72). For easier clinical interpretation, the ISI is divided into three interpretation bands of Green, Yellow, and Red that correspond to increasing disease severity. The ISI agreed with the diagnosis established by retrospective physician adjudication, and accurately identified subjects with severe illness as measured by SOFA, APACHE-II, hospital-free days, and intensive care unit admission. Measured using routinely collected blood samples, with a short run-time and no requirement for patient or laboratory information, the ISI is well suited to aid ED clinicians in rapidly diagnosing sepsis.",

    "abstract": "Plasma biochemistry and hematology reference intervals are integral health assessment tools in all medical fields, including aquatic animal health. As sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) are becoming aquaculturally and economically more important, this manuscript provides essential reference intervals (RI) for their plasma biochemistry and hematology along with reference photomicrographs of blood cells in healthy, fasted sablefish. Blood cell morphology can differ between fish species. In addition, blood cell counts and blood chemistry can vary between fish species, demographics, water conditions, seasons, diets, and culture systems, which precludes the use of RIs from other fish species. For this study, blood was collected for plasma biochemistry and hematology analysis between June 20 and July 18, 2019, from healthy, yearling sablefish, hatched and reared in captivity on a commercial diet. Overnight fast of 16-18 hours did not sufficiently reduce lipids in the blood, which led to visible lipemia and frequent rupture of blood cells during analysis. Therefore, sablefish should be fasted for 24 to 36 hours before blood is collected to reduce hematology artifacts or possible reagent interference in plasma biochemistry analysis. Lymphocytes were the most dominant leukocytes (98%), while eosinophils were rare, and basophils were not detected in sablefish. Neutrophils were very large cells with Dohle bodies. In mammals and avian species, Dohle bodies are usually signs of toxic change from inflammation, but no such association was found in these fish. In conclusion, lipemia can interfere with sablefish blood analysis, and available removal methods should be evaluated as fasting for up to 36 h might not always be feasible. Also, more studies are required to establish RI for different developmental stages and rearing conditions.",

    "abstract": "The isocortex of all mammals studied to date shows a progressive increase in the amount and continuity of background activity during early development. In humans the transition from a discontinuous (mostly silent, intermittently bursting) cortex to one that is continuously active is complete soon after birth and is a critical prognostic indicator in newborns. In the visual cortex of rodents this switch from discontinuous to continuous background activity occurs rapidly during the two days before eye-opening, driven by activity changes in relay thalamus. The factors that regulate the timing of continuity development, which enables mature visual processing, are unknown. Here we test the role of the retina, the primary input, in the development of continuous spontaneous activity in the visual system of mice using depth electrode recordings of cortical activity from enucleated mice in vivo. Bilateral enucleation at postnatal day (P)6, one week prior to the onset of continuous activity, acutely silences cortex, yet firing rates and early oscillations return to normal within two days and show a normal developmental trajectory through P12. Enucleated animals showed differences in silent period duration and continuity on P13 that resolved on P16, and an increase in low frequency power that did not. Our results show that the timing of cortical activity development is not determined by the major driving input to the system. Rather, homeostatic mechanisms in thalamocortex regulate firing rates and continuity even across periods of rapid maturation.",

Here we propose that contingency representations, defined as mappings for how future behaviors depend on upcoming events, can unify working memory and planning computations. We designed a task capable of disambiguating distinct types of representations. Our experiments revealed that human behavior is consistent with contingency representations, and not with traditional sensory models of working memory. In task-optimized recurrent neural networks we investigated possible circuit mechanisms for contingency representations and found that these representations can explain neurophysiological observations from prefrontal cortex during working memory tasks. Finally, we generated falsifiable predictions for neural data to identify contingency representations in neural data and to dissociate different models of working memory. Our findings characterize a neural representational strategy that can unify working memory, planning, and context-dependent decision making.",

    "abstract": "A major goal of large-scale brain imaging datasets is to provide resources for investigating heterogeneous populations. Characterisation of functional brain networks for individual subjects from these datasets will have an enormous potential for prediction of cognitive or clinical traits. We propose for the first time a technique, Stochastic Probabilistic Functional Modes (sPROFUMO), that is scalable to UK Biobank (UKB) with expected 100,000 participants, and hierarchically estimates functional brain networks in individuals and the population, while allowing for bidirectional flow of information between the two. Using simulations, we show the models utility, especially in scenarios that involve significant cross-subject variability, or require delineation of fine-grained differences between the networks. Subsequently, by applying the model to resting-state fMRI from 4999 UKB subjects, we mapped resting state networks (RSNs) in single subjects with greater detail than has been possible previously in UKB (>100 RSNs), and demonstrate that these RSNs can predict a range of sensorimotor and higher-level cognitive functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate several advantages of the model over independent component analysis combined with dual-regression (ICA-DR), particularly with respect to the estimation of the spatial configuration of the RSNs and the predictive power for cognitive traits. The proposed model and results can open a new door for future investigations into individualised profiles of brain function from big data.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe introduce stochastic PROFUMO (sPROFUMO) for inferring functional brain networks from big data\nC_LIO_LIsPROFUMO hierarchically estimates fMRI networks for the population and every individual\nC_LIO_LIWe characterised high dimensional resting state fMRI networks from UK Biobank\nC_LIO_LIModel outperforms ICA and dual regression for estimation of individual-specific network topography\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate the models utility for predicting cognitive traits, and capturing subject variability in network topographies versus connectivity\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The hippocampal formation is well documented as having a feedforward, unidirectional circuit organization termed the trisynaptic pathway. This circuit organization exists along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampal formation, but the circuit connectivity across septal to temporal regions is less well described. The emergence of viral-genetic mapping techniques enhances our ability to determine the detailed complexity of hippocampal formation circuitry. In earlier work, we mapped a subiculum back-projection to CA1 prompted by the discovery of theta wave back-propagation from the subiculum to CA1 and CA3. We reason that this circuitry may represent multiple extended non-canonical pathways involving the subicular complex and hippocampal subregions CA1 and CA3. In the present study, multiple retrograde viral tracing approaches produced robust mapping results, which supports this prediction. We find significant non-canonical synaptic inputs to dorsal hippocampal CA3 from ventral CA1, perirhinal cortex, and the subicular complex. Thus, CA1 inputs to CA3 run opposite the trisynaptic pathway and in a temporal to septal direction. Our retrograde viral tracing results are confirmed by anterograde-directed viral mapping of projections from input mapped regions to hippocampal dorsal CA3. Together, our data provide a circuit foundation to explore novel functional roles contributed by these non-canonical hippocampal circuit connections to hippocampal dynamics and behavior.",

    "abstract": "During phagocytosis, a key event in the virulence of the protozoan Entamoeba histolytica, several molecules in concert contact the target, generate pseudopodia, and internalize and digest the ingested prey. Posttranslational modifications provide proteins the timing and signaling to intervene in these processes. SUMOylation is a posttranslational modification that in several systems grants a fine tuning for protein functions, protein interactions and cellular location, but it has not been studied in E. histolytica. In this paper, we characterized the E. histolytica SUMO gene and its product (EhSUMO) and elucidated the EhSUMO 3D-structure. Furthermore, here we studied the relevance of SUMOylation in phagocytosis, particularly in its association with EhADH (an ALIX family protein) and EhVps32 (a protein of the ESCRT-III complex), both involved in phagocytosis. Our results indicated that EhSUMO has an extended N-terminus that differentiates other SUMO from ubiquitin. It also presents the GG residues at the C-terminus and the {Psi}KXE/D binding motif, both involved in target protein contact. Additionally, E. histolytica genome possesses the enzymes belonging to the SUMOylation-deSUMOylation machineries. Confocal microscopy assays, using -EhSUMO antibodies disclosed a remarkable membrane activity with convoluted and changing structures in trophozoites during erythrophagocytosis. SUMOylated proteins appeared in pseudopodia, phagocytic channels, and around the adhered and ingested erythrocytes. Docking analysis predicted interaction of EhSUMO with EhADH, and immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays revealed that the EhADH-EhSUMO association increased during phagocytosis, whereas the EhVps32-EhSUMO interaction appeared stronger since basal conditions. In EhSUMO knocked down trophozoites, the bizarre membranous structures disappeared, and EhSUMO interaction with EhADH and EhVps32 diminished. Our results evidenced the presence of a SUMO gene in E. histolytica and the SUMOylation relevance during phagocytosis.\n\nAuthors AbstractPhagocytosis is one of the main functions that Entamoeba histolyitica trophozoites carry out during the invasion to the host. Many proteins are involved in this fascinating event, in which the plasmatic membrane undergoes to multiple and speedy changes. Posttraductional modifications activate proteins in the precise time that they must get involved. SUMOylation, that consists in the non-covalent binding of SUMO protein with target molecules, is one of the main changes suffered by proteins in order to enable them to participate in cellular functions. SUMOylation had not been studied in E. histolytica nor in phagocytosis, and our working hypothesis is that this event is deeply engaged in the ingestion of target molecules and cells. The results of this paper prove the presence of an intronless bona fide EhSUMO gene encoding for a predicted 12.6 kDa protein that is actively involved in phagocytosis. Silencing of the EhSUMO gene affected the rate of phagocytosis and interfered with the EhADH and EhVps32 function, two proteins involved in phagocytosis, strongly supporting the importance of SUMOylation in this event.",

    "abstract": "European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and sardine (Sardina pilchardus) are crucial species for the marine ecosystem of the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea. They account for a high percentage of fish landings and they represent an important economic income. Concerns over their stock status are rising in recent years as biomass, growth, reproductive capacity and body condition of both species are declining. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a continuous and fast body condition monitoring scheme. Energy storage variability has important implications for both fish recruitment and population structure. Direct condition indices, such as bomb calorimetry, are highly reliable for measuring the energy content, but extremely time-consuming. Alternatively, fatmeter analysis and relative condition index (Kn) have been proposed as effective indirect methods. The aim of this study is to test the application of fatmeter as a surrogate of bomb calorimetry to infer the energy content of both small pelagic fishes. For the validation, fatmeter values were compared with both energy density (ED; via bomb calorimetry) and Kn values. Individuals of both species were sampled monthly in Barcelona harbor for a year in order to assess seasonal variations in energy content. Our results highlight that fatmeter measurements are strongly correlated with calorimetry for sardine, while a weaker but significant correlation was found for anchovy. The observed differences between the two species are related to their breeding strategies. Based on this study, fatmeter analysis appears to be a faster and suitable method to evaluate the energy content of both species routinely., In addition, we provide a linear model to infer ED from fatmeter values of both small pelagic fish. Eventually, these findings could allow for the avoidance of bomb calorimetry and could be used to implement body condition monitoring protocols, and to boost continuous large-scale monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Tunicates are highly diverse marine invertebrate filter-feeders that are vertebrates closest relatives. These organisms, despite a drastically different body plan during their adulthood, have a tissue complexity related to that of vertebrates. Ascidians, which compose most of the Tunicata, are benthic sessile hermaphrodites that reproduce sexually through a motile tadpole larval stage. Over half of the known ascidians species are able to reproduce asexually by budding, typically leading to the formation of colonies where animals, called zooids, are interconnected through an external vascular system. In addition, colonial ascidians are established models for important biological processes including allorecognition, immunobiology, aging, angiogenesis and whole-body regeneration. However, the current paucity in breeding infrastructures limits the study of these animals to coastal regions.\n\nTo promote a wider scientific spreading and popularity of colonial ascidians, we have developed a flexible recirculating husbandry setup for their long-term in-lab culture. Our system is inspired both by the flow-through aquariums used by coastal ascidian labs, as well as by the recirculating in-lab systems used for zebrafish research. Our hybrid system thus combines colony breeding, water filtering and food culturing in a semi-automated system where specimens develop on hanging microscopy glass slides. Temperature, light/dark cycles, flow speed and feeding rates can be controlled independently in four different breeding environments to provide room for species-specific optimization as well as for running experiments. This setup is complemented with a quarantine for the acclimatization of wild isolates.\n\nHerein we present our success in breeding Botrylloides diegensis, a species of colonial ascidians, for more than 3 years in recirculating artificial seawater over 600 km away from their natural habitat. We show that colonies adapt well to in-lab culturing provided that a suitable marine microbiome is present, and that a specific strain can be isolated, propagated and efficiently used for research over prolonged periods of time. The flexible and modular structure of our system can be scaled and adapted to the needs of specific species, such as Botryllus schlosseri, as well as of particular laboratory spaces. Overall, we show that Botrylloides diegensis can be proficiently bred in-land and suggest that our results can be extended to other species of colonial ascidians to promote research on these fascinating animals.\n\nHighlightsO_LIFirst artificial seawater based recirculating aquaculture for colonial ascidians\nC_LIO_LIOver 3 years of continuous breeding\nC_LIO_LISemi-automated setup with minimized maintenance\nC_LIO_LIGood biomass production for strain propagation\nC_LIO_LI4 different culture conditions for optimized breeding for species of interest\nC_LI",

In the last 15 years, damage has been observed in young and adult plants of N. tetetzo, ranging from chlorotic spots with a wet appearance in early stages to tissue necrosis in advanced stages and finally the death of the plant; Pectobacterium brasiliense is the causal agent of the damages. Disease progression may be delayed or accelerated by the involvement of other bacteria, either pathogenic or endophytic, at the site of infection. Our goal was to confirm the presence of Pectobacterium brasiliense, in the soft rot of N. tetetzo and to determine the presence of other bacteria associated with the rot. We isolated three bacterial strains (A1, A3 and A8) from diseased tissue from three separate N. tetetzo plants, and compare them using biochemical and molecular techniques, such as whole-genome sequencing of strains A1 and A3. Phylogenetic analyzes confirmed that A1 corresponded to P. brasiliense, whereas A3 was more misimlar to P. polaris. Additionally, sequencing of 16S rRNA gene from metagenomic DNA isolated from healthy and diseased tissue of N. tetetzo indicated the presence of four operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the order level, unique to the diseased tissue: Actinomycetales, Burkholderiales, Caulobacterales, and Sphingomonadales, with probable participation in the soft rot process.",

    "abstract": "Combining experiments with artificial intelligence algorithms, we propose a new machine learning based approach to extract the cellular force distributions from the microscope images. The full process can be divided into three steps. First, we culture the cells on a special substrate allowing to measure both the cellular traction force on the substrate and the corresponding substrate wrinkles simultaneously. The cellular forces are obtained using the traction force microscopy (TFM), at the same time that cell-generated contractile forces wrinkle their underlying substrate. Second, the wrinkle positions are extracted from the microscope images. Third, we train the machine learning system with GAN (generative adversarial network) by using sets of corresponding two images, the traction field and the input images (raw microscope images or extracted wrinkle images), as the training data. The network understands the way to convert the input images of the substrate wrinkles to the traction distribution from the training. After sufficient training, the network is utilized to predict the cellular forces just from the input images. Our system provides a powerful tool to evaluate the cellular forces efficiently because the forces can be predicted just by observing the cells under the microscope, which is a way simpler method compared to the TFM experiment. Additionally, the machine learning based approach presented here has the profound potential for being applied to diverse cellular assays for studying mechanobiology of cells.\n\nSignificance StatementCell-generated forces are indispensable determinants of fundamental cell functions such as motility and cell division. As such, quantifying how the forces change upon perturbations to the cells such as gene mutations and drug administration is of profound importance. Here we present a novel machine learning based system that allows for efficient estimations of the forces that are determined only by \"observing\" microscope images. Given that the cellular traction forces are regulated downstream of diverse signaling pathways, our system - that helps significantly improve the throughput of the measurements - presents a new, high throughput platform for real time analysis of the effects of a massive number of genetic and molecular perturbations on the forces and resulting cell mechanics.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic textiles shed fibers that accumulate indoors and this results in continuous exposure when indoors. High exposure to microplastic fibers in nylon flock workers has been linked to the development of airway and interstitial lung disease, but the exact health effects of microplastic fibers on the lungs are unknown. Here we determined effects of polyester and nylon textile microplastic fibers on airway and alveolar epithelial cells using human and murine lung organoids. We observed that particularly nylon microfibers had a negative impact on the growth and development of airway organoids. We demonstrated that this effect was mediated by components leaking from nylon. Moreover, our data suggested that microplastic textile fibers may especially harm the developing airways or airways undergoing repair. Our results call for a need to assess exposure and inhalation levels in indoor environments to accurately determine the actual risk of these fibers to human health.\n\nTeaserAirborne fibers shed from synthetic textiles, in particular nylon, can inhibit repair of the cells coating the airways",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWLarge-scale genotype-phenotype screens provide a wealth of data for identifying molecular alternations associated with a phenotype. Epistatic effects play an important role in such association studies. For example, siRNA perturbation screens can be used to identify pairwise gene-silencing effects. In bacteria, epistasis has practical consequences in determining antimicrobial resistance as the genetic background of a strain plays an important role in determining resistance. Existing computational tools which account for epistasis do not scale to human exome-wide screens and struggle with genetically diverse bacterial species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Combining earlier work in interaction detection with recent advances in integer compression, we present a method for epistatic interaction detection on sparse (human) exome-scale data, and an R implementation in the package Pint. Our method takes advantage of sparsity in the input data and recent progress in integer compression to perform lasso-penalised linear regression on all pairwise combinations of the input, estimating up to 200 million potential effects, including epistatic interactions. Hence the human exome is within the reach of our method, assuming one parameter per gene and one parameter per epistatic effect for every pair of genes. We demonstrate Pint on both simulated and real data sets, including antibiotic resistance testing and siRNA perturbation screens.",

    "abstract": "Mutation, recombination, selection, and demography affect genetic variation across the genome. Increased mutation and recombination both lead to increases in genetic diversity in a region-specific manner, while complex demographic patterns shape patterns of diversity on a more global scale. The X chromosome is particularly interesting because it contains several distinct regions that are subject to different combinations and strengths of these processes, notably the pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) and the X-transposed region (XTR). The X chromosome thus can serve as a unique model for studying how genetic and demographic forces act in different contexts to shape patterns of observed variation. Here we investigate diversity, divergence, and linkage disequilibrium in each region of the X chromosome using genomic data from 26 human populations. We find that both diversity and substitution rate are consistently elevated in PAR1 and the XTR compared to the rest of the X chromosome. In contrast, linkage disequilibrium is lowest in PAR1 and highest on the non-recombining X chromosome, with the XTR falling in between, suggesting that the XTR (usually included in the non-recombining X) may need to be considered separately in future studies. We also observed strong population-specific effects on genetic diversity; not only does genetic variation differ on the X and autosomes among populations, but the effects of linked selection on the X relative to autosomes have been shaped by population-specific history. The substantial variation in patterns of variation across these regions provides insight into the unique evolutionary history contained within the X chromosome.\n\nSignificance StatementDemography and selection affect the X chromosome differently from non-sex chromosomes. However, the X chromosome can be subdivided into multiple distinct regions that facilitate even more fine-scaled assessment of these processes. Here we study regions of the human X chromosome in 26 populations to find evidence that recombination may be mutagenic in humans and that the X-transposed region may undergo recombination. Further we observe that the effects of selection and demography act differently on the X chromosome relative to the autosomes across human populations. Together, our results highlight profound regional differences across the X chromosome, simultaneously making it an ideal system for exploring the action of evolutionary forces as well as necessitating its careful consideration and treatment in genomic analyses.",

    "abstract": "The ventral pallidum (VP) has been implicated in the regulation of rewarding adult social behaviors, such as pair-bonding and sociosexual motivation. However, the role of the VP in regulating rewarding juvenile social behaviors, such as social play, is unknown. Social play is predominantly displayed by juveniles of many mammalian species and engagement in social play helps develop social competence. In this study, we determined whether the VP is involved in regulating social play in juvenile rats by temporarily inactivating the VP via bilateral infusions of muscimol, the GABAA receptor agonist. Muscimol treatment decreased social play duration in males and females compared to the same-sex control groups. We then focused on the vasopressin (AVP) system in the VP as one potential modulator of social play. We examined the organization of the AVP system in the VP in juvenile rats and found robust sex differences, with denser AVP-immunoreacive fibers and denser vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) binding in males compared to females, but a greater number of V1aR-expressing cells in females compared to males. Next, we determined whether exposure to social play changed the activation of V1aR-expressing VP cells in male and female juvenile rats. We found that exposure to social play enhanced the number of V1aR-expressing VP cells co-expressing fos, a marker of neuronal activation, in males only. Finally, we determined the causal involvement of AVP signaling in the VP in social play behavior by infusion of a specific V1aR antagonist into the VP prior to social play exposure. We found that V1aR blockade in the VP increased social play duration in juvenile male rats but decreased social play duration in juvenile female rats compared to same-sex control groups. These findings reveal structural and functional sex differences in the AVP system in the VP that are associated with the sex-specific regulation of juvenile social play behavior.",

    "abstract": "RATIONALEAppropriate fibrotic tissue formation after myocardial infarction (MI) is crucial to maintenance of the hearts structure. Reparative or M2-like macrophages play a vital role in post-MI fibrosis by activating cardiac fibroblasts. However, the mechanism by which post-MI cardiac fibrosis is regulated is not fully understood.\n\nOBJECTIVEWe investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms of post-MI fibrotic tissue formation, especially those related to regulation of cellular senescence and apoptosis.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTSIn vivo and in vitro experiments were used to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which post-MI fibrosis occurs, with a focus on the role of M2-like macrophages. Microarray analysis revealed that CD206+F4/80+CD11b+ M2-like macrophages collected from mouse hearts on post-MI day 7 showed increased expression of neuregulin 1 (Nrg1). Nrg1 receptor epidermal growth factor receptor ErbB was expressed on cardiac fibroblasts in the infarct area. In cardiac fibroblasts in which hydrogen peroxide-induced senescence, M2-like macrophage-derived Nrg1 suppressed both senescence and apoptosis of the fibroblasts, whereas blockade of ErbB function significantly accelerated. M2-like macrophage-derived Nrg1/ErbB/PI3K/Akt signaling, which was shown to be related to anti-senescence, was activated in damaged cardiac fibroblasts. Interestingly, systemic blockade of ErbB function in MI model mice enhanced senescence and apoptosis of cardiac fibroblasts and exacerbated inflammation. Further, increased accumulation of M2-like macrophages resulted in excessive progression of fibrosis in post-MI murine hearts. The molecular mechanism underlying regulation of fibrotic tissue formation in the infarcted myocardium was shown in part to be attenuation of apoptosis and senescence of cardiac fibroblasts by activation of Nrg1/ErbB/PI3K/Akt signaling.\n\nCONCLUSIONSM2-like macrophage-mediated regulation of Nrg1/ErbB signaling, have a substantial effect on fibrotic tissue formation in the infarcted adult mouse heart, is critical for suppressing the progression of senescence and apoptosis of cardiac fibroblasts.",

We then use the normal distribution combined with LOESS regression to estimate background error rates as a function of sequencing depth for individual clusters of sequences. This method is computationally efficient and produces inference that yields sets of variants that are conservative and well supported by reference databases. We argue that this approach to inference is fast, simple, scalable to large datasets, and provides a high-resolution set of sequence variants which are less likely to be the result of sequencing error.",

    "abstract": "Substantial progresses in protein structure prediction have been made by utilizing deep-learning and residue-residue distance prediction since CASP13. Inspired by the advances, we improve our CASP14 MULTICOM protein structure prediction system in the three main aspects: (1) a new deep-learning based protein inter-residue distance predictor (DeepDist) to improve template-free (ab initio) tertiary structure prediction, (2) an enhanced template-based tertiary structure prediction method, and (3) distance-based model quality assessment methods empowered by deep learning. In the 2020 CASP14 experiment, MULTICOM predictor was ranked 7th out of 146 predictors in protein tertiary structure prediction and ranked 3rd out of 136 predictors in inter-domain structure prediction. The results of MULTICOM demonstrate that the template-free modeling based on deep learning and residue-residue distance prediction can predict the correct topology for almost all template-based modeling targets and a majority of hard targets (template-free targets or targets whose templates cannot be recognized), which is a significant improvement over the CASP13 MULTICOM predictor. The performance of template-free tertiary structure prediction largely depends on the accuracy of distance predictions that is closely related to the quality of multiple sequence alignments. The structural model quality assessment works reasonably well on targets for which a sufficient number of good models can be predicted, but may perform poorly when only a few good models are predicted for a hard target and the distribution of model quality scores is highly skewed.",

    "abstract": "I.A new approach to NASA space radiation risk modeling has successfully extended the current NASA probabilistic cancer risk model to an ensemble framework able to consider sub-model parameter uncertainty as well as model-form uncertainty associated with differing theoretical or empirical formalisms. Ensemble methodologies are already widely used in weather prediction, modeling of infectious disease outbreaks, and certain terrestrial radiation protection applications to better understand how uncertainty may influence risk decision-making. Applying ensemble methodologies to space radiation risk projections offers the potential to efficiently incorporate emerging research results, allow for the incorporation of future models, improve uncertainty quantification for underlying sub-models, and reduce the impact of subjective bias on risk projections. Moreover, risk forecasting across an ensemble of multiple predictive models can provide stakeholders additional information on risk acceptance if current health/medical standards cannot be met for future space exploration missions, such as human missions to Mars. In this work, ensemble risk projections implementing multiple sub-models of radiation quality, dose and dose-rate effectiveness factors, excess risk, and latency as ensemble members are presented. Initial consensus methods for ensemble model weights and correlations to account for individual model bias are discussed. In these analyses, the ensemble forecast compares well to results from NASAs current operational cancer risk projection model used to assess permissible mission durations for astronauts. However, a large range of projected risk values are obtained at the upper 95th confidence level where models must extrapolate beyond available biological data sets. Closer agreement is seen at the median + one sigma due to the inherent similarities in available models. Identification of potential new models, epidemiological data, and methods for statistical correlation between predictive ensemble members are discussed. Alternate ways of communicating risk and acceptable uncertainty with respect to NASAs current permissible exposure limits are explored.",

    "abstract": "Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons display a peculiar electrical phenotype characterized in vitro by a spontaneous tonic regular activity (pacemaking activity), a broad action potential and a biphasic post-inhibitory response. Several studies in rodents have underlined the central role played by the transient A-type current (IA) in the control of pacemaking activity and post-inhibitory rebound properties, thereby influencing both DA release and the physiological response of SNc neurons to incoming inhibitory inputs. Kv4.3 potassium channels were considered to be fully responsible for IA in these neurons, their density being tightly related to pacemaking frequency. In spite of this crucial electrophysiological role, we show that Kv4.3-/- transgenic mice exhibit minor alterations in locomotion and motor learning, although no compensation by functionally overlapping ion channels is observed in Kv4.3-/- SNc DA neurons. Using antigen retrieval immunohistochemistry, we further demonstrate that Kv4.2 potassium channels are also expressed in SNc DA neurons, even though their contribution to IA appears significant only in a minority of neurons (~5-10%). Using correlative analysis on recorded electrophysiological parameters and multi-compartment modeling, we then demonstrate that, rather than its conductance level, IA gating kinetics (inactivation time constant) appear as the main biophysical property defining post-inhibitory rebound delay and pacemaking frequency. Moreover, we show that the hyperpolarization-activated current (IH) has an opposing and complementary influence on the same firing features, and that the biophysical properties of IA and IH are likely coregulated in mouse SNc DA neurons.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSubstantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons are characterized by pacemaking activity, a broad action potential and biphasic post-inhibitory response.

    "abstract": "Development of effective antiviral drugs targeting the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are urgently needed to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Oxysterols, defined as oxidized derivatives of cholesterol, include endogenous (naturally occurring) cholesterol metabolites as well as semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives. We have previously studied the use of semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives as drug candidates for inhibition of cancer, fibrosis, and bone regeneration. In this study, we have screened a panel of naturally occurring and semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, using a cell culture infection assay. We show that the natural oxysterols, 7-ketocholesterol, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol, substantially inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cultured cells. Among semi-synthetic oxysterols, Oxy186 displayed antiviral activity comparable to natural oxysterols. In addition, related oxysterol analogues Oxy210 and Oxy232 displayed more robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, reducing viral replication more than 90% at 10 M and 99% at 15 M, respectively. When orally administered in mice, peak plasma concentrations of Oxy210 fall into a therapeutically relevant range (19 M), based on the dose-dependent curve for antiviral activity in our cell culture infection assay. Mechanistic studies suggest that Oxy210 reduced replication of SARS-CoV-2 with disrupting the formation of double membrane vesicles (DMVs), intracellular membrane compartments associated with viral replication. Oxy210 also inhibited the replication of hepatitis C virus, another RNA virus whose replication is associated with DMVs, but not the replication of the DMV-independent hepatitis D virus. Our study warrants further evaluation of Oxy210 and Oxy232 as a safe and reliable oral medication, which could help protect vulnerable populations with increased risk developing COVID-19.",

There were seven major terpenoid compounds in the leaf extracts, including 2 monoterpenes of camphor and L-borneol, and 5 sesquiterpenes of silphiperfol-5-ene, 7-epi-silphiperfol-5-ene, {beta}-caryophyllene, {ramshorn}-eudesmol, and -eudesmol. Different hydrodistillation periods resulted in different quantitates and compositions of the terpenoids in EOs. The yield of EOs from the immature leaves was 1.4 times higher than the mature ones, whereas 73% of the yield was collected from the first 6 h of hydrodistillation. Camphor and L-borneol were almost collected in the first 6 h, while {beta}-caryophyllene, silphiperfolene, and 7-epi-silphiperfolene were above 80%, but {ramshorn}-eudesmol and -eudesmol were only 32 and 54% released. {beta}-Caryophyllene, {ramshorn}-eudesmol, and -eudesmol were found higher in the mature leaf EOs. Antioxidant capacities in EOs were positively related to terpenoid contents. Antibacterial activity of EOs from the immature leaves was subsequently tested. Although EOs from the hydrodistillation period of 12-18 h contained fewer terpenoid compositions, it showed the same minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) on Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared to 0-6 h EOs.",
