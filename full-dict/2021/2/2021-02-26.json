    "abstract": "DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are cytotoxic lesions repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR), with 5 strand resection being the committed step in transition from NHEJ to HR. We previously discovered that gal1 yeast, which cannot metabolize galactose, were unable to perform efficient 5 resection even though DSBs were formed. Adding glucose or restoring GAL1 restored resection, suggesting that carbon source metabolism signals to DSB repair. Here we demonstrate that any fermentable carbon source, including raffinose, can stimulate resection and that the stimulatory effect of glucose was associated with decreased, not increased, cellular ATP. The effect was cell cycle dependent and did not occur in G1, while glucose augmented the G2/M checkpoint arrest even in cells deficient in resection. AMP-activated protein kinase pathway mutants showed only low basal resection despite glucose addition but had normal checkpoint arrest, indicating a primary role for Snf1 specifically in glucose-stimulated resection. The metabolic inputs to resection were multifactorial, however, with loss of the transcriptional repressor Mig1 leading to increased basal resection, three distinct patterns of deficiency with loss of the protein kinase A catalytic subunits, Tpk1, Tpk2 andTpk3, and a resection delay in yeast lacking the lysine demethylase Rph1 that helped separate early and late phase responses to glucose. These results reveal multiple interrelated metabolic signals that optimize DSB resection efficiency while independently amplifying the G2/M checkpoint response.",

    "abstract": "Interlockings nails (IN) are orthopedic implants with superior mechanical and, potentially, biological qualities. Despite the countless and indisputable advantages of current angle-stable models, there are still limitations for their use in certain scenarios. The objective of the present study was to describe and biomechanically test a new orthogonal angle-stable intramedullary nail model for veterinary use. The proposed orthogonal angle-stable nail has two 3.8-mm threaded cylindrical holes in each of its portions: in the proximal portion, the holes are 11 mm apart; in the distal portion, the penultimate orifice is positioned at 90 degrees in relation to the last one, with a distance of 5.5 mm between them. The novel orthogonal nail (Group 3 - G3) was evaluated and compared biomechanically with the conventional interlocking nail (Group 1 - G1) and the uniplanar angle-stable nail (Group 2 - G2) by means of destructive torsion and axial compression tests. No statistically significant differences were observed in torsion resistance between the groups in the destructive tests. However, statistical differences were found in stiffness values in the compression tests between the orthogonal (G3) and conventional interlocking (G1) nails (p=0.01) and also between the uniplanar (G2) and interlocking (G1) nails (p=0.001). The new orthogonal nail proved to be biomechanically similar to the uniplanar angle-stable model and superior to the conventional nail. This new arrangement of interlocking screws (orthogonal and closer to each other) potentially enables the fixation of small fragments and at the extremities of long bones in dogs. Nonetheless, further clinical studies are necessary to validate such hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "Inactivating mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 cause Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, an autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by multi-system tumor and hamartoma development. Mutation and loss of function of TSC1 and/or TSC2 also occur in a variety of sporadic cancers, and rapamycin and related drugs show highly variable treatment benefit in patients with such cancers. The TSC1 and TSC2 proteins function in a complex that inhibits mTORC1, a key regulator of cell growth, which acts to enhance anabolic biosynthetic pathways. In this study, we identified and validated five cancer cell lines with TSC1 or TSC2 mutations and performed a kinase inhibitor drug screen with 197 compounds. The five cell lines were sensitive to several mTOR inhibitors, and cell cycle kinase and HSP90 kinase inhibitors. The IC50 for Torin1 and INK128, both mTOR kinase inhibitors, was significantly increased in three TSC2 null cell lines in which TSC2 expression was restored. Rapamycin was significantly more effective than either INK128 or ganetespib (an HSP90 inhibitor) in reducing the growth of TSC2 null SNU-398 cells in a xenograft model. Combination ganetespib-rapamycin showed no significant enhancement of growth suppression over rapamycin. Hence, although HSP90 inhibitors show strong inhibition of TSC1/TSC2 null cell line growth in vitro, ganetespib showed little benefit at standard dosage in vivo. In contrast, rapamycin which showed very modest growth inhibition in vitro was the best agent for in vivo treatment, but did not cause tumor regression, only growth delay.",

    "abstract": "To competently navigate the world, individuals must flexibly balance distinct aspects of social gaze, orienting toward others and inhibiting orienting responses, depending on the context. These behaviors are often disrupted in patient populations treated with serotonergic drugs. However, the field lacks a clear understanding of how the serotonergic system mediates social orienting and inhibiting behaviors. Here, we tested how increasing central concentrations of serotonin with the direct precursor 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) would modulate the ability of rhesus macaques to use eye movements to flexibly orient to, or inhibit orienting to, faces. Systemic administrations of 5-HTP effectively increased central serotonin levels and impaired flexible orientation and inhibition. Critically, 5-HTP selectively impaired the ability of monkeys to inhibit orienting to face images, whereas it similarly impaired orienting to face and control images. 5-HTP also caused monkeys to perseverate on their gaze responses, making them worse at flexibly switching between orientating and inhibiting behaviors. Furthermore, the effects of 5-HTP on performance correlated with a constriction of the pupil, an increased time to initiate trials, and an increased reaction time, suggesting that the disruptive effects of 5-HTP on social gaze behaviors are likely driven by a downregulation of arousal and motivational states. Taken together, these findings provide causal evidence for a modulatory relationship between 5-HTP and social gaze behaviors in non-human primates and offer translational insights for the role of the serotonergic system in social gaze.",

    "abstract": "Place cells, spatially responsive hippocampal cells, provide the neural substrate supporting navigation and spatial memory. Historically most studies of these neurons have used electrophysiological recordings from implanted electrodes but optical methods, measuring intracellular calcium, are becoming increasingly common. Several methods have been proposed as a means to identify place cells based on their calcium activity but there is no common standard and it is unclear how reliable different approaches are. Here we tested three methods that have previously been applied to two-photon hippocampal imaging or electrophysiological data, using both model datasets and real imaging data. These methods use different parameters to identify place cells, including the peak activity in the place field, compared to other locations (the Peak method); the stability of cells activity over repeated traversals of an environment (Stability method); and a combination of these parameters with the size of the place field (Combination method). The three methods performed differently from each other on both model and real data. The Peak method showed high sensitivity and specificity for detecting model place cells and was the most robust to variations in place field width, reliability and field location. In real datasets, vastly different numbers of place cells were identified using the three methods, with little overlap between the populations identified as place cells. Therefore, choice of place cell detection method dramatically affects the number and properties of identified cells. We recommend the Peak method be used in future studies to identify place cell populations, unless there is an explicit theoretical reason for detecting cells with more narrowly defined properties.\n\nAuthor SummaryPlace cells are hippocampal cells that have spatially constrained receptive fields, the place field. These cells have been widely studied in the context of navigation, more recently using virtual reality environments in combination with optical methods of recording neuronal activity. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding how to identify place cells in these data. In this study we tested the sensitivity and specificity of three methods of identifying place cells. By comparing these methods and quantifying the populations of place cells they identify, we aimed to increase our understanding of exactly the populations that are currently being studied under the name \"place cells\". Although the appropriate method may depend on the experimental design, we generally recommend a single method going forward, which will increase consensus within the field about what should be included in a place cell population, and allow us to better compare results between studies.",

    "abstract": "Cortical circuits generate excitatory currents that must be cancelled by strong inhibition to assure stability. The resulting excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance can generate spontaneous irregular activity but, in standard balanced E-I models, this requires that an extremely strong feedforward bias current be included along with the recurrent excitation and inhibition. The absence of experimental evidence for such large bias currents inspired us to examine an alternative regime that exhibits asynchronous activity without requiring unrealistically large feedforward input. In these networks, irregular spontaneous activity is supported by a continually changing sparse set of neurons. To support this activity, synaptic strengths must be drawn from high-variance distributions. Unlike standard balanced networks, these sparse balance networks exhibit robust nonlinear responses to uniform inputs and non-Gaussian statistics. In addition to simulations, we present a mean-field analysis to illustrate the properties of these networks.",

In this paper, we performed time-lapse morphological analysis of human cells and found that THz irradiation halts cell division at cytokinesis. At the end of cytokinesis, the contractile ring, which consists of filamentous actin (F-actin), needs to disappear; however, it remained for 1 hour under THz irradiation. Induction of the functional structures of F-actin was also observed in interphase cells. Similar phenomena were also observed under chemical treatment (jasplakinolide), indicating that THz irradiation assists actin polymerization. We previously reported that THz irradiation enhances the polymerization of purified actin in vitro; our current work shows that it increases cytoplasmic F-actin in vivo. Thus, we identified one of the key biomechanisms affected by THz waves.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to develop a numerical model of the eyeball and orbit to simulate a blunt injury to the eyeball leading to its rupture, as well as to conduct a comparative analysis of the results obtained using the finite element method against the clinical material concerning patients who had suffered an eyeball rupture due to a blunt force trauma. Using available sclera biometric and strength data, a numerical model of the eyeball, the orbital contents, and the bony walls were developed from the ground up. Then, eight different blunt force injury scenarios were simulated. The results of numerical analyses made it possible to identify possible locations and configurations of scleral rupture. The obtained results were compared against the clinical picture of patients hospitalized at the Clinic of Ophthalmology in 2010-2016 due to isolated blunt force trauma to the eyeball. It has been demonstrated that the extent of damage observed on the numerical model that indicated a possible location of eyeball rupture did not differ from the clinically observed configurations of the scleral injuries, however this applies to injuries the extend of which did not exceed 2-3 clock-hours on the eyeball. It has been found that the direction of the impact applied determines the location of eyeball rupture. Most often the rupture occurs at the point opposite to the clock-hour of the impact application. The eyeball rupture occurs in the first 7-8 milliseconds after the contact with the striking object, assuming that it strikes at a speed close to the speed of a human fist. It has been established that the injuries most often affected the upper sectors of the eyeball. Men are definitely more likely to sustain such injuries. Eyeball ruptures lead to significant impairment of visual acuity being most often degraded to light perception in front of the eye. Despite immediate specialist treatment, it is possible to achieve, on average, a visual acuity of 0.26 as per the Snellen scale. This study may contribute to a better understanding of injury mechanisms and better treatment planning. It may also contribute to the development of eyeball protection methods for persons exposed to the above-mentioned injuries.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGene annotation in eukaryotes is a non-trivial task that requires meticulous analysis of accumulated transcript data. Challenges include transcriptionally active regions of the genome that contain overlapping genes, genes that produce numerous transcripts, transposable elements and numerous diverse sequence repeats. Currently available gene annotation software applications depend on pre-constructed full-length gene sequence assemblies which are not guaranteed to be error-free. The origins of these sequences are often uncertain, making it difficult to identify and rectify errors in them. This hinders the creation of an accurate and holistic representation of the transcriptomic landscape across multiple tissue types and experimental conditions. Therefore, to gauge the extent of diversity in gene structures, a comprehensive analysis of genome-wide expression data is imperative.\n\nResultsWe present FINDER, a fully automated computational tool that optimizes the entire process of annotating genes and transcript structures. Unlike current state-of-the-art pipelines, FINDER automates the RNA-Seq pre-processing step by working directly with raw sequence reads and optimizes gene prediction from BRAKER2 by supplementing these reads with associated proteins. The FINDER pipeline (1) reports transcripts and recognizes genes that are expressed under specific conditions, (2) generates all possible alternatively spliced transcripts from expressed RNA-Seq data, (3) analyzes read coverage patterns to modify existing transcript models and create new ones, and (4) scores genes as high- or low-confidence based on the available evidence across multiple datasets. We demonstrate the ability of FINDER to automatically annotate a diverse pool of genomes from eight species.\n\nConclusionsFINDER takes a completely automated approach to annotate genes directly from raw expression data. It is capable of processing eukaryotic genomes of all sizes and requires no manual supervision - ideal for bench researchers with limited experience in handling computational tools.",

Diffusion MRI (dMRI) has become the mainstay methodology for probing microstructure, and, in ischemia, its contrasts have revolutionized stroke management. However, the biological underpinnings of the contrasts observed in conventional dMRI in general and in ischemia in particular are still highly debated since the markers only indirectly reporter on microstructure. Here, we present Correlation Tensor MRI (CTI), a method that rather than measuring diffusion, harnesses diffusion correlations as its source of contrast. We show that CTI can resolve the sources of diffusional kurtosis, which in turn, provide dramatically enhanced specificity and sensitivity towards ischemia. In particular, the sensitivity towards ischemia nearly doubles, both in grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM), and unique signatures for neurite beading, cell swelling, and edema are inferred from CTI. The enhanced sensitivity and specificity endowed by CTI bodes well for future applications in biomedicine, basic neuroscience, and in the clinic.",

This rapid industrialization of seabed resource use is introducing new pressures to marine environments. The environmental impacts of such pressures should be carefully evaluated prior to permitting new activities, yet observational data is mostly missing. Here, we examine the environmental risks of seabed mining using a causal, probabilistic network approach. Drawing on a series of interviews with a multidisciplinary group of experts, we outline the cause-effect pathways related to seabed mining activities to inform quantitative risk assessments. The approach consists of (1) iterative model building with experts to identify the causal connections between seabed mining activities and the affected ecosystem components, and (2) quantitative probabilistic modelling to provide estimates of mortality of benthic fauna in the Baltic Sea. The model is used to evaluate alternative mining scenarios, offering a quantitative means to highlight the uncertainties around the impacts of mining. We further outline requirements for operationalizing quantitative risk assessments, highlighting the importance of a cross-disciplinary approach to risk identification. The model can be used to support permitting processes by providing a more comprehensive description of the potential environmental impacts of seabed resource use, allowing iterative updating of the model as new information becomes available.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements comprise almost half of the mammalian genome. A growing body of evidence suggests that transposable element dysregulation accompanies brain aging and neurodegenerative disorders, and that transposable element activation is neurotoxic. Recent studies have identified links between pathogenic forms of tau, a protein that accumulates in Alzheimer disease and related tauopathies, and transposable element-induced neurotoxicity. Starting with transcriptomic analyses, we find that age- and tau-induced transposable element activation occurs in the mouse brain. Among transposable elements that are activated at the RNA level in the context of brain aging and tauopathy, we find that the endogenous retrovirus (ERV) class of retrotransposons is particularly enriched. We show that protein encoded by Intracisternal A-particle, a highly active mouse ERV, is elevated in brains of tau transgenic mice. We further demonstrate that brains of tau transgenic mice contain increased DNA copy number of transposable elements, raising the possibility that these elements actively retrotranspose in the context of tauopathy. Taken together, our study lays the groundwork for future mechanistic studies focused on transposable element regulation in the aging mouse brain and in mouse models of tauopathy, while providing support for therapeutic approaches targeting transposable element activation for Alzheimer disease and related tauopathies.",

    "abstract": "In the Northeast Atlantic, advice for many fish stocks follows the ICES MSY approach, where a zero catch will be recommended if the stock is below its limit reference point, Blim, and cannot rebuild in the short-term. How-ever, zero catch advice are rarely implemented by managers. This study used medium-term stochastic forecasts with harvest control rules (HCRs) to investigate the consequences of allowing reduced fishing below Blim. We applied the method to western Baltic herring and North Sea cod, two contrasting species currently estimated below Blim. We show that the minimum rebuilding probability of 95% required by the MSY approach could be impossible to reach in the short-to medium-term. When this is the case, a lower probability may need to be considered instead in the short-term. Recruitment is the largest source of uncertainty in stock response to management, and can exceed differences between HCRs. Reference points should be estimated in accordance with current recruitment levels if they are to be used for short-term advice or as realistic rebuilding targets. For both stocks, it is possible to keep fishing at reduced levels for similar cumulative catch, SSB and risk on the stock in the medium-term compared to no catch below Blim. Medium-term trade-offs between stock conservation and fisheries considerations may be needed when fishery closure cannot be implemented in practice.",

    "abstract": "Precise genome editing using designer nucleases (DNs), such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system, has become a method of choice in a variety of biological and biomedical applications in recent years. Notably, efficacy of these systems is currently under scrutiny in about 50 clinical trials. Although high DNs activity in various cell types in vitro has already been achieved, efficient in vivo genome editing remains a challenge. To solve this problem, we employed stem cells-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as carriers of DNs. We used umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as EV-producer cells, since they are both applied in regenerative medicine. In our proof-of-concept studies, we achieved up to 50% of EGFP marker gene knockout in vivo using EVs carrying either ZFN, TALEN or the CRISPR/Cas9 system, particularly in the liver. Importantly, we obtained almost 50% of modified alleles in the liver of the experimental animals, when targeting the Pcsk9 gene, whose overexpression is implicated in hypercholesterolemia. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that stem cells-derived EVs constitute a robust tool in delivering DNs in vivo, which may be harnessed to clinical practice in the future.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes are dynamic cells with important roles in brain function and neurological disease. There are notable species differences between human astrocytes and commonly used animal models. However, changes of the molecular attributes of human astrocytes across disease states, sex, and age are largely unknown, which is a barrier in understanding human astrocyte biology and its potential involvement in neurological diseases. To better understand the properties of human astrocytes, we acutely purified astrocytes from the cerebral cortices of over 40 humans across various ages, sexes, and disease states. We performed RNA sequencing to generate transcriptomic profiles of these astrocytes and identified genes associated with these biological variables. Here, we identified a robust transcriptomic signature of human astrocytes in the tumor-surrounding microenvironment, including upregulation of proliferation processes, along with downregulation of genes involved in ionic homeostasis and synaptic function, suggesting involvement of peri-tumor astrocytes in tumor-associated neural circuit dysfunction. In aging, we also found downregulation of synaptic regulators and upregulation of markers of astrocyte reactivity, while in maturation we identified changes in ionic transport with implications for calcium signaling. In addition, we identified some of the first transcriptomic evidence of sexual dimorphism in human cortical astrocytes, which has implications for observed sex differences across many neurological disorders. Overall, genes involved in synaptic function exhibited dynamic changes in multiple conditions. This data provides powerful new insights into human astrocyte biology in several biologically relevant states, that will aid in generating novel testable hypotheses about homeostatic and reactive astrocytes in humans.\n\nSignificance StatementAstrocytes are an abundant class of cells playing integral roles in the central nervous system. Astrocyte dysfunction is implicated in a variety of human neurological diseases. Yet our knowledge of astrocytes is largely based on mouse studies. Direct knowledge of human astrocyte biology remains limited. Here, we present transcriptomic profiles of human cortical astrocytes, and we identified molecular differences associated with age, sex, and disease state. We found changes suggesting involvement of peritumor astrocytes in tumor-associated neural circuit dysfunction, aging-associated decline in astrocyte-synapse interactions, ionic transport changes with brain maturation, and some of the first evidence of sexual dimorphism in human astrocytes. These data provide necessary insight into human astrocyte biology that will improve our understanding of human disease.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates require suitable material properties to properly carry out their function. Yet, modulators that affect the material properties of condensates have remained largely unexplored.\n\nHere we apply Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) to probe the material properties of an in vitro model of processing bodies (P-bodies) consisting of condensates formed by the DEAD-box ATPase Dhh1 in the presence of ATP and RNA. DDM allows us to measure the viscosity of liquid droplets and to distinguish between liquid-like and gel- or glass-like condensates. By applying this single-droplet technique we show that condensates within the same population exhibit a distribution of material properties, which can be drastically affected by several modulators such as the low-complexity domains (LCDs) of the protein, the protein/RNA ratio, the type of RNA as well as the enzymatic activity.\n\nIn particular, we show that structured RNA leads to a large fraction of dynamically arrested condensates with respect to unstructured polyuridylic acid (polyU), emphasizing the role of RNA structure in condensate dynamics. We further demonstrate that the ageing of the condensates and the formation of gel or glass-like structures is reduced by promoting the enzymatic ATPase activity of Dhh1 and the rate of droplet formation and dissolution.\n\nOur study shows that not only the reversible formation and dissolution of condensates but also their material properties are regulated on several levels, and that biochemical activity and material turnover can be important to maintain fluid-like properties over time.",

    "abstract": "The condensin protein complex compacts chromatin during mitosis using its DNA-loop extrusion activity. Previous studies proposed scrunching and loop-capture models as molecular mechanisms for the loop extrusion process, both of which assume the binding of double-strand (ds) DNA to the so-called hinge domain formed at the interface of the condensin subunits Smc2 and Smc4. However, how the hinge domain contacts dsDNA has remained unknown, potentially due to its conformational plasticity. Here, we conducted atomic force microscopy imaging of the budding yeast condensin holo-complex and used this data as basis for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to model the hinge structure in a transient open conformation. We then simulated the dsDNA binding to open and closed hinge conformations, predicting that dsDNA binds to the outside surface when closed and to the outside and inside surfaces when open. Our simulations also suggested that the hinge can close around dsDNA bound to the inside surface. The conformational change of the hinge domain might be essential for the dsDNA binding regulation and play important roles in condensin-mediated DNA-loop extrusion.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms regulating HIV persistence are complex and not well understood. Increased IL-10 levels were positively associated with HIV reservoir in blood and lymph nodes (LN) of treated HIV aviremic individuals. In LNs, B cells, regulatory T cells, follicular T helper cells (Tfh), monocytes and macrophages contributed to the frequencies of IL10+ cells. Cells with HIV DNA in LNs were in close proximity to IL-10+ cells and/or had the active form of STAT3, the transcription downstream of IL-10. Gene signatures and proteins associated to cell survival, Co-inhibitory receptors expression, maintenance of memory T cells, immune metabolism and Tfh frequencies were all modulated by IL-10 and associated with HIV reservoir persistence. In vitro, STAT3 knockout or neutralization of IL-10, reverted all the aforementioned pathways and resulted in 10-fold decay in HIV reservoir. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence for a pivotal role of IL-10 in HIV persistence, and a potential therapeutic strategy for HIV cure.",

    "abstract": "The FDA-approved proteasomal inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ) has attracted interest for its potential anti-fibrotic actions. However, neither its in vivo efficacy in lung fibrosis nor its dependence on proteasome inhibition has been conclusively defined. Herein, we identify that therapeutic administration of BTZ in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis diminished the severity of fibrosis without reducing proteasome activity in the lung. Under conditions designed to mimic this lack of proteasome inhibition in vitro, it reduced fibroblast proliferation, differentiation into myofibroblasts, and collagen synthesis. It promoted de-differentiation of myofibroblasts and overcame their characteristic resistance to apoptosis. Mechanistically, BTZ inhibited kinases important for fibroblast activation while inducing expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 1 or DUSP1, and knockdown of DUSP1 abolished its anti-fibrotic actions in fibroblasts. Our findings identify a novel proteasome-independent mechanism of anti-fibrotic actions for BTZ and support its therapeutic repurposing for pulmonary fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "The A-to-G point mutation at position 3243 in the human mitochondrial genome (m.3243A>G) is the most common pathogenic mtDNA variant responsible for disease in humans. It is widely accepted that m.3243A>G levels decrease in blood with age, and an age correction representing [~]2% annual decline is often applied to account for this change in mutation level. Here we report that recent data indicate the dynamics of m.3243A>G are more complex and depend on the mutation level in blood in a bi-phasic way. Consequently, the traditional 2% correction, which is adequate  on average, creates opposite predictive biases at high and low mutation levels. Unbiased age correction is needed to circumvent these drawbacks of the standard model. We propose to eliminate both biases by using an approach where age correction depends on mutation level in a biphasic way to account for the dynamics of m.3243A>G in blood. The utility of this approach was further tested in estimating germline selection of m.3243A>G. The biphasic approach permitted us to uncover patterns consistent with the possibility of positive selection for m.3243A>G. Germline selection of m.3243A>G shows an  arching profile by which selection is positive at intermediate mutant fractions and declines at high and low mutant fractions. We conclude that use of this biphasic approach will greatly improve the accuracy of modelling changes in mtDNA mutation frequencies in the germline and in somatic cells during aging.",

    "abstract": "The fibrous architecture of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is recognized as an integral regulator of cell function. However, there is an unmet need to develop mechanically robust biomaterials mimicking nanofibrous tissue topography that are also injectable to enable minimally invasive delivery. In this study we have developed a fibrous hydrogel composed of supramolecularly-assembled hyaluronic acid (HA) nanofibers that exhibits mechanical integrity, shear-thinning, rapid self-healing, and cytocompatibility. HA was modified with methacrylates to permit fiber photocrosslinking following electrospinning and either  guest adamantane or  host {beta}-cyclodextrin groups to guide supramolecular fibrous hydrogel assembly. Analysis of fibrous hydrogel rheological properties showed that the mixed guest-host fibrous hydrogel was more mechanically robust (6.6 {+/-} 2.0 kPa, storage modulus (G')) than unmixed guest hydrogel fibers (1.0 {+/-} 0.1 kPa, G') or host hydrogel fibers (1.1 {+/-} 0.1 kPa, G') separately. The reversible nature of the guest-host supramolecular interactions also allowed for shear-thinning and self-healing behavior as demonstrated by cyclic deformation testing. Human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) encapsulated in fibrous hydrogels demonstrated satisfactory viability following injection and after seven days of culture (> 85%). Encapsulated hMSCs were more spread and elongated when cultured in viscoelastic guest-host hydrogels compared to non-fibrous elastic controls, with hMSCs also showing significantly decreased circularity in fibrous guest-host hydrogels compared to non-fibrous guest-host hydrogels. Together, these data highlight the potential of this injectable fibrous hydrogel platform for cell and tissue engineering applications requiring minimally invasive delivery.",

    "abstract": "Human visual attention is readily captured by the social information in scenes. Multiple studies have shown that social areas of interest (AOIs) such as faces and bodies attract more attention than non-social AOIs (e.g. objects or background). However, whether this attentional bias is moderated by the presence (or absence) of a social interaction remains unclear. Here, the gaze of 70 young adults was tracked during the free viewing of 60 naturalistic scenes. All photographs depicted two people, who were either interacting or not. Analyses of dwell time revealed that more attention was spent on human than background AOIs in the interactive pictures. In non-interactive pictures, however, dwell time did not differ between AOI type. In the time-to-first-fixation analysis, humans always captured attention before other elements of the scene, although this difference was slightly larger in interactive than non-interactive scenes. These findings confirm the existence of a bias towards social information in attentional capture, and suggest that the presence of social interaction may be important in inducing a similar social bias in attentional engagement. Together with previous research using less naturalistic stimuli, these findings suggest that social interactions carry additional social value that guides ones perceptual system.",

We show that the iRO acts autonomously and sends direct inputs to key muscles in order to coordinate neonatal vocalizations with breathing, as well as paces and patterns these cries.
