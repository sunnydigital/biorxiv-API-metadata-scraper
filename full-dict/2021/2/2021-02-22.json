    "abstract": "The importance of lysosomes in cardiac physiology and pathology are well established, and evidence for roles in calcium signalling are emerging. We describe a label-free proteomics method suitable for small cardiac tissue biopsies based on density-separated fractionation, which allows study of endo-lysosomal (EL) proteins.\n\nDensity gradient fractions corresponding to tissue lysate; sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), mitochondria (Mito) (1.3 g/ml); and EL with negligible contamination from SR or Mito (1.04 g/ml), were analysed using Western Blot, enzyme activity assay and LC-MS/MS analysis (adapted discontinuous Percoll, and sucrose differential density gradient).\n\nKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Reactome, Panther and Gene Ontology pathway analysis showed good coverage of RAB proteins and lysosomal cathepsins (including cardiac-specific cathepsin D) in the purified EL fraction. Significant EL proteins recovered included catalytic activity proteins. We thus present a comprehensive protocol and dataset of guinea-pig atrial EL organelle proteomics using techniques also applicable for non-cardiac tissue.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks are the most deleterious lesions for the cells, therefore understanding the macromolecular interactions in the DNA repair-related mechanisms is essential. DNA damage triggers transcription silencing at the damage site, leading to the removal of the elongating RNA polymerase II (S2P RNAPII) from this locus, which provides accessibility for the repair factors to the lesion. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPK) are the two main regulatory kinases of homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining, respectively. Although these kinases are involved in the activation of different repair pathways, they have common target proteins, such as P53. We previously demonstrated that following transcription block, P53 plays a pivotal role in transcription elongation process by interacting with S2P RNAPII. In the current study, we reveal that P53, ATM and DNAPK are involved in the fine-tune regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system-related degradation of S2P RNAPII. However, they act differently in this process: P53 delays the removal of S2P RNAPII, while ATM and DNAPK participate in the activation of members of E3 ligase complexes involved in the ubiquitylation of S2P RNAPII. We also demonstrate that WW domain-containing protein 2 (WWP2) and Cullin-3 (CUL3) are interaction partners of S2P RNAPII, thus forming a complex with the transcribing RNAPII complex.\n\nSimple SummaryTo ensure the proper repair following DNA double-strand breaks, the eviction of the arrested elongating RNA polymerase II (S2P RNAPII) is required. Here, we report an emerging role of P53, Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPK) in the ubiquitin-proteasome system-dependent removal of S2P RNAPII. We also identified interactions between S2P RNAPII and WW domain-containing protein 2 (WWP2) or Cullin-3 (CUL3) (members of E3 ligase complexes), which are involved in the ubiquitylation of S2P RNAPII following DNA damage. Furthermore, the RNAPII-E3 ligase complex interactions are mediated by P53, ATM and DNAPK, which suggests potential participation of all three proteins in the effective resolution of transcription block at the damage site. Altogether, our results provide a better comprehension of the molecular background of transcription elongation block-related DNA repair processes and highlight an indispensable function of P53, ATM and DNAPK in these mechanisms.",

However, the neutralization potency of two antibodies, 1-57 and 2-7, which target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike, was unaffected by these emerging strains. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of 1-57 and 2-7 in complex with spike, revealing each of these antibodies to utilize a distinct mechanism to bypass or accommodate RBD mutations. Notably, each antibody represented a response with recognition distinct from those of frequent antibody classes. Moreover, many epitope residues recognized by 1-57 and 2-7 were outside hotspots of evolutionary pressure for both ACE2 binding and neutralizing antibody escape. We suggest the therapeutic use of antibodies like 1-57 and 2-7, which target less prevalent epitopes, could ameliorate issues of monoclonal antibody escape.",

In acutely-infected (5-19 days post-symptom onset), convalescent COVID-19 individuals (through 8 months post-symptom onset) and mRNA-1273 vaccinated individuals (day 14 post-second dose), we observed an average 4.3-fold reduction in antibody titers to the B.1.351-derived receptor binding domain of the spike protein and an average 3.5-fold reduction in neutralizing antibody titers to the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant as compared to the B.1 variant (spike D614G).

    "abstract": "Since its initial discovery in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID19, has spread worldwide and despite significant research efforts, treatment options remain limited. Replication of SARS-CoV-2 in lung is associated with marked infiltration of macrophages and activation of innate immune inflammatory responses triggered, in part, by heightened production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) that recruits lymphocytes to the site of infection that amplify tissue injury. Antagonists of the glucocorticoid and androgen receptors have shown promise in experimental models of COVID19 and in clinical studies, because cell surface proteins required for viral entry, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), are transcriptionally regulated by these receptors. We therefore postulated that the glucocorticoid (GR) and androgen receptor (AR) antagonist, PT150, would reduce infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent inflammatory lung injury in the Syrian golden hamster model of COVID19. Animals were infected intranasally with 2.5 x 104 TCID50/ml equivalents of SARS-CoV-2 (strain 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/ 2020) and PT150 was administered by oral gavage at 30 and 100 mg/Kg/day for a total of 7 days. Animals were then examined at days 3, 5 and 7 post-infection (DPI) for lung histopathology, viral load and production of proteins regulating the initiation and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results of these studies indicated that oral administration of PT150 decreased replication of SARS-CoV-2 in lung, as well as expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein. Hypercellularity and inflammatory cell infiltration driven by macrophage responses were dramatically decreased in PT150-treated animals, as was tissue damage and expression of IL-6. Molecular modeling suggested that PT150 binds to the co-activator interface of the ligand binding domain of both AR and GR and thereby acts as an allosteric modulator and transcriptional repressor of these receptors. Phylogenetic analysis of AR and GR across multiple species permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed a high degree of sequence identity maintained across species, including human, suggesting that the mechanism of action and therapeutic efficacy observed in Syrian hamsters would likely be predictive of positive outcomes in patients. PT150 is therefore a strong candidate for further clinical development for the treatment of COVID19 across variants of SARS-CoV-2.",

However, ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 can render monoclonal antibodies ineffective. Here we completely map all mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that escape binding by a leading monoclonal antibody, LY-CoV555, and its cocktail combination with LY-CoV016. Individual mutations that escape binding by each antibody are combined in the circulating B.1.351 and P.1 SARS-CoV-2 lineages (E484K escapes LY-CoV555, K417N/T escape LY-CoV016). Additionally, the L452R mutation in the B.1.429 lineage escapes LY-CoV555. Furthermore, we identify single amino acid changes that escape the combined LY-CoV555+LY-CoV016 cocktail. We suggest that future efforts should diversify the epitopes targeted by antibodies and antibody cocktails to make them more resilient to antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Nucleosome stability, a crucial determinant of gene regulation, was measured in a robust in situ assay to assess the molecular determinants of the stability of H2A.Z-containig nucleosomes. Surprisingly, a large fraction of H2A.Z detected by three different antibodies was released from the nucleosomes by salt together with H3, and was associated with H3K9me3 but not with H3K27me3 marked nucleosomes. This unusual behavior relied on the presence of the unstructured C-terminal chain of the histone variant, rather than on isoform specificity, posttranslational modifications or binding of the reader protein PWWPA2, as determined using cell lines expressing only particular forms of the variant. In the absence of this tail, or upon addition of an excess of the tail peptide to the nuclei of control cells, the canonical H2A-like stability features were readily restored and most of the H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes left the periphery and ended up in scattered foci in the nuclei. Concomitantly, the H3K9me3-marked constitutive heterochromatin was also dispersed, what was accompanied by increased overall nuclease sensitivity and significantly enhanced binding of intercalating dyes to the DNA. The DT40 cells expressing the tailless H2A.Z showed marked differences in their gene expression pattern and were distinguished by compromised DNA damage response. Thus, interactions involving a short H2A.Z peptide chain simultaneously determine the stability and accessibility features of chromatin involving the nucleosomes containing this histone variant and the localization of these large chromatin regions in the nucleus. Our data suggest that H2A.Z can function in both heterochromatic and in euchromatic scenarios depending on the molecular interactions involving its C-terminal unstructured tail, shedding light on the enigmatic double-faced character of this histone variant.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive changes in lysosomal capacity are driven by the transcription factors TFEB and TFE3 in response to increased autophagic flux and endolysosomal stress, yet the molecular details of their activation are unclear. LC3 and GABARAP members of the ATG8 protein family are required for selective autophagy and sensing perturbation within the endolysosomal system. Here we show that during single membrane ATG8 conjugation (SMAC), Parkin-dependent mitophagy, and Salmonella-induced xenophagy, the membrane conjugation of GABARAP, but not LC3, is required for activation of TFEB/TFE3 to control lysosomal homeostasis and capacity. GABARAP directly binds to a novel LC3-interacting motif (LIR) in the FLCN/FNIP tumor suppressor complex with picomolar affinity and regulates its relocalization to these GABARAP-conjugated membrane compartments. This disrupts the regulation of RagC/D by the FLCN/FNIP GAP complex, resulting in impaired mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of TFEB without changing mTOR activity towards other substrates. Thus, the GABARAP-FLCN/FNIP-TFEB axis serves as a universal molecular sensor that coordinates lysosomal homeostasis with perturbations and cargo flux within the autophagy-lysosomal network.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we used an integrative computational approach focused on comparative perturbation-based modeling to examine molecular mechanisms and determine functional signatures underlying role of functional residues in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are targeted by novel mutational variants and antibody-escaping mutations. Atomistic simulations and functional dynamics analysis are combined with alanine scanning and mutational sensitivity profiling for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with the ACE2 host receptor are REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail (REG10987+REG10933). Using alanine scanning and mutational sensitivity analysis, we have shown that K417, E484 and N501 residues correspond to key interacting centers with a significant degree of structural and energetic plasticity that allow mutants in these positions to afford the improved binding affinity with ACE2. Through perturbation-based network modeling and community analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with ACE2 we demonstrate that E406, N439, K417 and N501 residues serve as effector centers of allosteric interactions and anchor major inter-molecular communities that mediate long-range communication in the complexes. The results provide support to a model according to which mutational variants and antibody-escaping mutations constrained by the requirements for host receptor binding and preservation of stability may preferentially select structurally plastic and energetically adaptable allosteric centers to differentially modulate collective motions and allosteric interactions in the complexes with the ACE2 enzyme and REGN-COV2 antibody combination. This study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may function as a versatile and functionally adaptable allosteric machine that exploits plasticity of allosteric regulatory centers to fine-tune response to antibody binding without compromising activity of the spike protein.",

    "abstract": "The lower respiratory tract infections affecting children worldwide are in large part caused by the parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), particularly HPIV3, along with human metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, enveloped negative-strand RNA viruses. There are no vaccines for these important human pathogens, and existing treatments have limited or no efficacy. Infection by HPIV is initiated by viral glycoprotein-mediated fusion between viral and host cell membranes. A viral fusion protein (F), once activated in proximity to a target cell, undergoes a series of conformational changes that first extend the trimer subunits to allow insertion of the hydrophobic domains into the target cell membrane, and then refold the trimer into a stable postfusion state, driving the merger of the viral and host cell membranes. Lipopeptides derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) domain of HPIV3 F inhibit infection by interfering with the structural transitions of the trimeric F assembly. Clinical application of this strategy, however, requires improving the in vivo stability of antiviral peptides. We show that the HRC peptide backbone can be modified via partial replacement of -amino acid residues with {beta}-amino acid residues to generate /{beta}-peptides that retain antiviral activity but are poor protease substrates. Relative to a conventional -lipopeptide, our best /{beta}-lipopeptide exhibits improved persistence in vivo and improved anti-HPIV3 antiviral activity in animals.",

S. poulsonii inhabits the fly hemolymph and gets vertically transmitted over generations by hijacking the oogenesis in females. Using dual proteomics on infected hemolymph, we uncovered a low level and chronic activation of the Toll immune pathway by S. poulsonii that was previously undetected by transcriptomics-based approaches. Using Drosophila genetics, we also identified candidate proteins putatively involved in controlling S. poulsonii growth. Last, we also provide a deep proteome of S. poulsonii, which, in combination with previously published transcriptomics data, improves our understanding of the post-transcriptional regulations operating in this bacterium.\n\nSummary statementWe report the changes in Drosophila melanogaster hemolymph proteome upon infection with the heritable bacterial endosymbiont Spiroplasma poulsonii.",

    "abstract": "Nutrition plays a key role in pre- and postnatal growth of the musculoskeletal system. Maternal diet during gestation and lactation affects the development of skeletal muscles in the offspring and determines muscle health in later life, however, the molecular mechanisms that govern these effects are largely unknown. In this study, we aim to describe the association between maternal low protein diet-induced changes in offspring skeletal muscle and the differential expression (DE) of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs). We used a mouse model of maternal protein restriction to characterise the impact of early-life undernutrition on skeletal muscle morphology in male offspring at weaning. Mouse dams were fed either a normal (N, 20%) or a low protein (L, 8%) diet during gestation and newborn pups were cross-fostered to N or L lactating dams, resulting in the generation of NN, NL and LN offspring groups. Total body and tibialis anterior (TA) weights were decreased in NL males but not different in the LN group, as compared to NN, although neonates from low protein fed dams were smaller at birth than those born to dams fed a normal protein. However, histological evaluation of TA muscle revealed reduced muscle fibre size in both groups at the end of lactation. Small RNA-seq analysis demonstrated DE of multiple classes of sncRNAs, including miRs, snoRNAs and snRNAs. Bioinformatic analyses of miRs-15a, -34a, -122 and -199a, in combination with known myomiRs, confirmed their implication in key muscle-specific biological processes and cellular functions and suggest a promising set of miRs in muscle physiology studies. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report for the DE of sncRNAs in nutrition-associated programming of skeletal muscle development, highlighting the need for further research.",

    "abstract": "Protein disorder is a major hurdle for structural biology. A prominent example is the tumour suppressor p53, whose low expression levels and poor conformational stability due to a high degree of disorder pose major challenges to the development of cancer therapeutics. Here, we address these issues by fusing p53 to an engineered spider silk domain termed NT*. The chimeric protein displays highly efficient translation in vitro and in E. coli and is fully active in human cancer cells. The transmission electron microscopy structure and native mass spectrometry reveal that the full-length p53 fusion protein adopts a compact conformation. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the disordered transactivation domain of p53 is wound around the NT* domain via a series of folding events, resulting in a globular structure. We find that expression of B-Raf, another partially disordered cancer target, is similarly enhanced by fusion to NT*. In summary, we demonstrate how inducing co-translational folding via a molecular \"spindle and thread\" mechanism can overcome poor translation efficiency of partially disordered proteins.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput third-generation sequencing devices, such as the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION sequencer, can generate long reads that span thousands of bases. This new technology opens the possibility of considering a wide range of epigenetic modifications and provides the capability of interrogating previously inaccessible regions of the genome, such as highly repetitive regions, as well as of performing comprehensive allele-specific methylation analysis, among other applications. It is well-known, however, that detection of DNA methylation from nanopore data results in a substantially reduced per-read accuracy when comparing to WGBS, due to noise introduced by the sequencer and its underlying chemistry. It is therefore imperative that methods are developed for the reliable modeling and analysis of the DNA methylation landscape using nanopore data. Here we introduce such method that takes into account the presence of noise introduced by the ONT sequencer and, by using simulations, we provide evidence of its potential. The proposed approach establishes a solid foundation for the development of a comprehensive framework for the statistical analysis of DNA methylation, and possibly of other epigenetic marks, using third-generation sequencing.",

Here, we have developed a nanoceutical cotton fabric duly sensitized with non-toxic zinc oxide nanomaterial for potential use as membrane filter in the one way valve for the ease of breathing without the threat of COVID-19 spreading. A detailed computational study revealed that zinc oxide nanoflowers (ZnO NF) with almost two-dimensional petals trap SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, responsible to attach to ACE-2 receptors in human lung epithelial cells. The study also confirm significant denaturation of the spike proteins on the ZnO surface, revealing removal of virus upon efficient trapping. Following the computational study, we have synthesized ZnO NF on cotton matrix using hydrothermal assisted strategy. Electron microscopic, steady-state and picosecond resolved spectroscopic studies confirm attachment of ZnO NF to the cotton (i.e., cellulose) matrix at atomic level to develop the nanoceutical fabric. A detailed antimicrobial assay using Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria (model SARS-CoV-2 mimic) reveals excellent anti-microbial efficiency of the developed nanoceutical fabric. To our understanding the novel nanoceutical fabric used in one-way valve of a face mask would be the choice to assure breathing comfort along with source control of COVID-19 infection.

Here, we relate information to behavioral performance in Escherichia coli chemotaxis. First, we derive a theoretical limit for the maximum achievable gradient-climbing speed given a cells information acquisition rate. Next, we measure cells gradient-climbing speeds and the rate of information acquisition by the chemotaxis pathway. We find that E. coli make behavioral decisions with much less than the 1 bit required to determine whether they are swimming up-gradient. However, they use this information efficiently, performing near the theoretical limit. Thus, information can limit organisms performance, and sensory-motor pathways may have evolved to efficiently use information from the environment.",

Therefore, a comprehensive map of receptor organization is needed to understand how different functions may emerge across distinct cortical regions. Here we use in-vitro receptor autoradiography to measure the density of 14 neurotransmitter receptor types in 109 areas of macaque cortex. We integrate the receptor data with other anatomical, genetic and functional connectivity data into a common cortical space. We uncovered a principal gradient of increasing receptor expression per neuron aligned with cortical hierarchy from early sensory cortex to higher cognitive areas. A second gradient, primarily driven by 5-HT1A receptors, peaks in the anterior and subcallosal cingulate, suggesting that the macaque may be a promising animal model for major depressive disorder. The receptor gradients may enable rapid, reliable information processing in sensory cortical areas and slow, flexible integration of information in higher cognitive areas.",

    "abstract": "Backgroundthe cortico-cerebellar-thalamic-cortical circuit has been implicated in the emergence of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia (SZ). The kynurenine pathway (KP) has been linked to alterations in glutamatergic and monoaminergic neurotransmission and to SZ symptomatology through the production of the metabolites quinolinic acid (QA) and kynurenic acid (KYNA).\n\nMethodsthis work describes alterations in KP in the post-mortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) and cerebellum (CB) of 15 chronic SZ patients and 14 control subjects in PFC and 13 control subjects in CB using immunoblot for protein levels and ELISA for interleukins and QA and KYNA determinations. Monoamine metabolites were analysed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography and SZ symptomatology was assessed by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The association of KP with inflammatory mediators, monoamine metabolism and SZ symptomatology was explored.\n\nResultsin the PFC, the presence of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 together with IDO2 and KATII enzymes decreased in SZ, while TDO and KMO enzymes expression increased. A network interaction analysis showed that in the PFC IL-10 was coupled to the QA branch of the kynurenine pathway (TDO-KMO-QA), whereas IL-10 associated with KMO in CB. KYNA in the CB inversely correlated with negative and general PANSS psychopathology. Although there were no changes in monoamine metabolites content in the PFC in SZ, a network interaction analysis showed associations between dopamine and methoxyhydroxyphenylglycol degradation metabolite. Direct correlations were found between general PANSS psychopathology and the serotonin degradation metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Interestingly, KYNA in the CB inversely correlated with 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the PFC.\n\nConclusionsthus, this work found alterations in KP in two brain areas belonging to the cortico-cerebellar-thalamic-cortical circuit associated with SZ symptomatology, with a possible impact across areas in 5-HT degradation.",

Cryo-EM analysis of ribosomes in this fraction indicates they are stalled, mainly in the hybrid state. Ribosome profiling of this fraction showed an abundance of footprint reads derived from mRNAs of cytoskeletal proteins implicated in neuronal development and an enrichment of footprint reads on RNA binding proteins. Compared to those usually found in ribosome profiling studies, the footprint reads were more extended on their 3end and were found in reproducible peaks in the mRNAs. These peaks were enriched in motifs previously associated with mRNAs cross-linked to FMRP in vivo, independently linking the ribosomes in the sedimented pellet to the ribosomes associated with FMRP in the cell. The data supports a model in which specific sequences in mRNAs act to stall translation elongation in neurons.",

    "abstract": "We aim to establish a comprehensive COVID-19 autoantigen atlas in order to understand autoimmune diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the unique affinity between dermatan sulfate and autoantigens, we identified 348 proteins from human lung A549 cells, of which 198 are known targets of autoantibodies. Comparison with current COVID data identified 291 proteins that are altered at protein or transcript level in SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 191 being known autoantigens. These known and putative autoantigens are significantly associated with viral replication and trafficking processes, including gene expression, ribonucleoprotein biogenesis, mRNA metabolism, translation, vesicle and vesicle-mediated transport, and apoptosis. They are also associated with cytoskeleton, platelet degranulation, IL-12 signaling, and smooth muscle contraction. Host proteins that interact with and that are perturbed by viral proteins are a major source of autoantigens. Orf3 induces the largest number of protein alterations, Orf9 affects the mitochondrial ribosome, and they and E, M, N, and Nsp proteins affect protein localization to membrane, immune responses, and apoptosis. Phosphorylation and ubiquitination alterations by viral infection define major molecular changes in autoantigen origination. This study provides a large list of autoantigens as well as new targets for future investigation, e.g., UBA1, UCHL1, USP7, CDK11A, PRKDC, PLD3, PSAT1, RAB1A, SLC2A1, platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase, and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. This study illustrates how viral infection can modify host cellular proteins extensively, yield diverse autoantigens, and trigger a myriad of autoimmune sequelae.",

We investigated evidence for host specialisation within P. cactorum through comparative genomic analysis of 18 isolates. Whole genome phylogenetic analysis provided genomic support for discrete lineages within P. cactorum, with well supported non-recombing clades for strawberry CR and apple infecting isolates specialised to strawberry crowns and apple tissue. Isolates of strawberry CR are genetically similar globally, while there is more diversity in apple-infecting isolates. We sought to identify the genetic basis of host specialisation, demonstrating gain and loss of effector complements within the P. cactorum phylogeny, representing putative determinants of host boundaries. Transcriptomic analysis highlighted that those effectors found to be specific to a single host or expanded in the strawberry lineage are amongst those most highly expressed during infection of strawberry and give a wider insight into the key effectors active during strawberry infection. Many effectors that had homologs in other Phytophthoras that have been characterised as avirulence genes were present but not expressed in our tested isolate. Our results highlight several RxLR-containing effectors that warrant further investigation to determine whether they are indeed virulence factors and host-specificity determinants for strawberry and apple. Furthermore, additional work is required to determine whether these effectors are suitable targets to focus attention on for future resistance breeding efforts.",

    "abstract": "Tracking evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within infected individuals will help elucidate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis and inform use of antiviral interventions. In this study, we developed an approach for sequencing the region encoding the SARS-CoV-2 virion surface proteins from large numbers of individual virus RNA genomes per sample. We applied this approach to the WA-1 reference clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 passaged in vitro and to upper respiratory samples from 7 study participants with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from cell culture were diverse, including 18 haplotypes with non-synonymous mutations clustered in the spike NH2-terminal domain (NTD) and furin cleavage site regions. By contrast, cross-sectional analysis of samples from participants with COVID-19 showed fewer virus variants, without structural clustering of mutations. However, longitudinal analysis in one individual revealed 4 virus haplotypes bearing 3 independent mutations in a spike NTD epitope targeted by autologous antibodies. These mutations arose coincident with a 6.2-fold rise in serum binding to spike and a transient increase in virus burden. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a capacity for rapid genetic adaptation that becomes detectable in vivo with the onset of humoral immunity, with the potential to contribute to delayed virologic clearance in the acute setting.\n\nAuthor SummaryMutant sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) arising during any individual case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could theoretically enable the virus to evade immune responses or antiviral therapies that target the predominant infecting virus sequence. However, commonly used sequencing technologies are not optimally designed to detect variant virus sequences within each sample. To address this issue, we developed novel technology for sequencing large numbers of individual SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA molecules across the region encoding the virus surface proteins. This technology revealed extensive genetic diversity in cultured viruses from a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2, but lower diversity in samples from 7 individuals with COVID-19. Importantly, concurrent analysis of paired serum samples in selected individuals revealed relatively low levels of antibody binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the time of initial sequencing. With increased serum binding to spike protein, we detected multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants bearing independent mutations in a single epitope, as well as a transient increase in virus burden. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 replication creates sufficient virus genetic diversity to allow immune-mediated selection of variants within the time frame of acute COVID-19. Large-scale studies of SARS-CoV-2 variation and specific immune responses will help define the contributions of intra-individual SARS-CoV-2 evolution to COVID-19 clinical outcomes and antiviral drug susceptibility.",

We have previously shown that an element which overlaps the HPV18 transcriptional enhancer promotes stable DNA replication of replicons containing the viral replication origin. Here we perform comprehensive analyses to elucidate the function of this maintenance element. We conclude that no unique element or binding site in this region is absolutely required for persistent replication and partitioning, and instead propose that the overall chromatin architecture of this region is important to promote efficient use of the replication origin. These results have important implications on the genome partitioning mechanism of papillomaviruses.",

    "abstract": "The recent rise in mutational variants of SARS-CoV-2, especially with changes in the Spike protein, is of significant concern due to the potential ability for these mutations to increase viral infectivity, virulence and/or ability to escape protective antibodies. Here, we investigated genetic variations in a 414-583 amino acid region of the Spike protein, partially encompassing the ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), across a subset of 570 nasopharyngeal samples isolated between April 2020 and February 2021, from Washington, California, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Illinois. We found that samples isolated since November have an increased number of amino acid mutations in the region, with L452R being the dominant mutation. This mutation is associated with a recently discovered CAL.20C viral variant from clade 20C, lineage B.1.429, that since November-December 2020 is associated with multiple outbreaks and is undergoing massive expansion across California. In some samples, however, we found a distinct L452R-carrying variant of the virus that, upon detailed analysis of the GISAID database genomes, is also circulating primarily in California, but emerged even more recently.\n\nThe newly identified variant derives from the clade 20A (lineage B.1.232) and is named CAL.20A. We also found that the SARS-CoV-2 strain that caused the only recorded case of infection in an ape - gorillas in the San Diego Zoo, reported in January 2021 - is CAL.20A. In contrast to CAL.20C that carries two additional to L452R mutations in the Spike protein, L452R is the only mutation found in CAL.20A. According to the phylogenetic analysis, however, emergence of CAL.20C was also specifically triggered by acquisition of the L452R mutation. Further analysis of GISAID-deposited genomes revealed that several independent L452R-carrying lineages have recently emerged across the globe, with over 90% of the isolates reported between December 2020 - February 2021. Taken together, these results indicate that the L452R mutation alone is of significant adaptive value to SARS-CoV-2 and, apparently, the positive selection for this mutation became particularly strong only recently, possibly reflecting viral adaptation to the containment measures or increasing population immunity. While the functional impact of L452R has not yet been extensively evaluated, leucine-452 is positioned in the receptor-binding motif of RBD, in the interface of direct contact with the ACE2 receptor. Its replacement with arginine is predicted to result in both a much stronger binding to the receptor and escape from neutralizing antibodies. If true, this in turn might lead to significantly increased infectivity of the L452R variants, warranting their close surveillance and in-depth functional studies.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms that turnover components of the nucleus and inner nuclear membrane (INM) remain to be fully defined. We explore how components of the INM are selected by a cytosolic autophagy apparatus through a transmembrane nuclear envelope-localized cargo adaptor, Atg39. A split-GFP reporter shows that Atg39 localizes to the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) and thus targets the INM across the nuclear envelope lumen. Consistent with this, sequence elements that confer both nuclear envelope localization and a membrane remodeling activity are mapped to the Atg39 lumenal domain; these lumenal motifs are required for the autophagy-mediated degradation of an integral INM protein. Interestingly, correlative light and electron tomography shows that the overexpression of Atg39 leads to the expansion of the ONM and the enclosure of a network of INM-derived vesicles in the nuclear envelope lumen. Thus, we propose an outside-in model of nucleophagy where INM is delivered into vesicles in the nuclear envelope lumen, which can be targeted by the autophagosome.",

We show that the G-coupled protein receptor Adgrg6, previously implicated in human AIS association studies, is required in these tissues to maintain typical spine morphology. We show that Adgrg6 regulates biomechanical properties of tendon and stimulates CREB signaling governing gene expression in cartilaginous tissues of the spine.

    "abstract": "The tree of life is the fundamental biological roadmap for navigating the evolution and properties of life on Earth, and yet remains largely unknown. Even angiosperms (flowering plants) are fraught with data gaps, despite their critical role in sustaining terrestrial life. Today, high-throughput sequencing promises to significantly deepen our understanding of evolutionary relationships. Here, we describe a comprehensive phylogenomic platform for exploring the angiosperm tree of life, comprising a set of open tools and data based on the 353 nuclear genes targeted by the universal Angiosperms353 sequence capture probes. This paper (i) documents our methods, (ii) describes our first data release and (iii) presents a novel open data portal, the Kew Tree of Life Explorer (https://treeoflife.kew.org). We aim to generate novel target sequence capture data for all genera of flowering plants, exploiting natural history collections such as herbarium specimens, and augment it with mined public data. Our first data release, described here, is the most extensive nuclear phylogenomic dataset for angiosperms to date, comprising 3,099 samples validated by DNA barcode and phylogenetic tests, representing all 64 orders, 404 families (96%) and 2,333 genera (17%). Using the multi-species coalescent, we inferred a \"first pass\" angiosperm tree of life from the data, which totalled 824,878 sequences, 489,086,049 base pairs, and 532,260 alignment columns. The tree is strongly supported and highly congruent with existing taxonomy, while challenging numerous hypothesized relationships among orders and placing many genera for the first time. The validated dataset, species tree and all intermediates are openly accessible via the Kew Tree of Life Explorer. This major milestone towards a complete tree of life for all flowering plant species opens doors to a highly integrated future for angiosperm phylogenomics through the systematic sequencing of standardised nuclear markers. Our approach has the potential to serve as a much-needed bridge between the growing movement to sequence the genomes of all life on Earth and the vast phylogenomic potential of the worlds natural history collections.",

One type of mixed mating includes outcrossing with conspecifics and self-fertilizing ones own eggs. The mangrove rivulus fish (Kryptolebias marmoratus) is one of two vertebrates known to employ both self-fertilization (selfing) and outcrossing. Variation in rates of outcrossing and selfing within and among populations produces individuals with diverse levels of heterozygosity. I designed an experiment to explore the consequences of variable heterozygosity across four ecologically relevant conditions of salinity and water availability (10{per thousand}, 25{per thousand}, and 40{per thousand} salinity, and twice daily tide changes). I report a significant increase in mortality in the high salinity (40{per thousand}) treatment. I also report significant effects on fecundity measures with increasing heterozygosity. The odds of laying eggs decreased with increasing heterozygosity across all treatments, and the number of eggs laid decreased with increasing heterozygosity in the 10{per thousand} and 25{per thousand} treatments. Increasing heterozygosity also was associated with a reduction liver mass and body condition in all treatments. My results highlight the fitness challenges that accompany living in mangrove forests ecosystem and provide the first evidence for outbreeding depression on reproductive and condition-related traits.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe evolutionary histories of the antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae lineages PMEN3 and PMEN9 were reconstructed using global collections of genomes. In PMEN3, one resistant clade spread worldwide, and underwent 25 serotype switches, enabling evasion of vaccine-induced immunity. In PMEN9, only 9 switches were detected, and multiple resistant lineages emerged independently and circulated locally. In Germany, PMEN9s expansion correlated significantly with the macrolide:penicillin consumption ratio. These isolates were penicillin sensitive but macrolide resistant, through a homologous recombination that integrated Tn1207.1 into a competence gene, preventing further diversification via transformation. Analysis of a species-wide dataset found 183 acquisitions of macrolide resistance, and multiple gains of the tetracycline-resistant transposon Tn916, through homologous recombination, often originating in other streptococcal species. Consequently, antibiotic selection preserves atypical recom- bination events that cause sequence divergence and structural variation throughout the S. pneumoniae chromosome. These events reveal the genetic exchanges between species normally counter-selected until perturbed by clinical interventions.",

We experimentally establish that RBD containing the N501Y mutation results in 9-fold stronger binding to the hACE2 receptor than wild type RBD. The E484K mutation does not significantly influence the affinity for the receptor, while K417N attenuates affinity. As a result, RBD from B.1.351 containing all three mutations binds 3-fold stronger to hACE2 than wild type RBD but 3-fold weaker than N501Y. The recently emerging double mutant E484K/N501Y binds as tight as N501Y. The independent evolution of lineages containing mutations with different effects on receptor binding affinity, viral transmission and immune evasion underscores the importance of global viral genome surveillance and functional characterization.",

    "abstract": "Shuttle protein UBQLN2 functions in protein quality control (PQC) by binding to proteasomal receptors and ubiquitinated substrates via its N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) and C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains, respectively. Between these two folded domains are intrinsically disordered STI1-I and STI1-II regions, connected by disordered linkers. The STI1 regions bind other components, such as HSP70, that are important to the PQC functions of UBQLN2. We recently determined that the STI1-II region enables UBQLN2 to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form liquid droplets in vitro and biomolecular condensates in cells. However, how the interplay between the folded (UBL/UBA) domains and the intrinsically-disordered regions mediates phase separation is largely unknown. Using engineered domain deletion constructs, we found that removing the UBA domain inhibits UBQLN2 LLPS while removing the UBL domain enhances LLPS, suggesting that UBA and UBL domains contribute asymmetrically in modulating UBQLN2 LLPS. To explain these differential effects, we interrogated the interactions that involve the UBA and UBL domains across the entire UBQLN2 molecule using NMR spectroscopy. To our surprise, aside from well-studied canonical UBL:UBA interactions, there also exist moderate and weak interactions between the UBL and STI1-I/STI1-II domains, and between the UBA domain and the linker connecting the two STI1 regions, respectively. Our findings are essential for the understanding of both the molecular driving forces of UBQLN2 LLPS and the effects of ligand binding to UBL, UBA, or STI1 domains on the phase behavior and physiological functions of UBQLN2.\n\nImpact of Work StatementZheng and Castaneda show that interplay between the folded domains and intrinsically disordered regions regulates liquid-liquid phase separation behavior of UBQLN2, a protein quality control (PQC) shuttle protein. Despite their similar size, the folded UBL and UBA domains inhibit and promote phase separation, respectively, due to their previously uncharacterized, asymmetric interactions with the middle intrinsically-disordered region. These results strongly suggest that PQC components, including proteasomal receptors, are likely to modulate UBQLN2 phase separation behavior in cells.",

While genetic mutations have long been accepted as a primary mechanism of generating this heterogeneity, the role of phenotypic plasticity is becoming increasingly apparent as a driver of intra-tumour heterogeneity. Consequently, understanding the role of plasticity in treatment resistance and failure is a key component of improving cancer therapy. We develop a mathematical model of stochastic phenotype switching that tracks the evolution of drug-sensitive and drug-tolerant subpopulations to clarify the role of phenotype switching on population growth rates and tumour persistence. By including cytotoxic therapy in the model, we show that, depending on the strategy of the drug-tolerant subpopulation, stochastic phenotype switching can lead to either transient or permanent drug resistance. We study the role of phenotypic heterogeneity in a drug-resistant, genetically homogeneous population of non-small cell lung cancer cells to derive a rational treatment schedule that drives population extinction and avoids competitive release of the drug-tolerant sub-population. This model-informed therapeutic schedule results in increased treatment efficacy when compared against periodic therapy, and, most importantly, sustained tumour decay without the development of resistance.\n\nAuthor summaryWe propose a simple mathematical model to understand the role of phenotypic plasticity and non-genetic inheritance in driving therapy resistance in cancer. We identify the role of non-genetic inheritance on treatment resistance and use a variety of analytical and numerical techniques to understand the impact of phenotypic plasticity on population fitness and dynamics. We further use our model to study the role of phenotypic heterogeneity in therapeutic resistance in a genetically identical non-small cell lung cancer population. Finally, we combine analytical perspectives and techniques from the theory of structured populations, renewal equations and infinite dimensional dynamical systems to derive a model informed therapeutic strategy that both drives tumour eradication while avoiding competitive release of a drug-tolerant subpopulation. These results exemplify the potential of using mathematical techniques to identify therapeutic strategies to guide the evolution of a heterogeneous tumour.",

    "abstract": "Immunosuppressive elements within the tumor microenvironment such as Tumor Associated Macrophages (TAMs) can present a barrier to successful anti-tumor responses by cytolytic T cells. We employed preclinical syngeneic p53 null mouse models of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) to develop a treatment regimen that harnessed the immunostimulatory effects of low-dose cyclophosphamide coupled with the pharmacologic inhibition of TAMs using either a small molecule CSF1R inhibitor or an anti-CSF1R antibody. This therapeutic combination was used to successfully treat several highly aggressive TNBC murine mammary tumors and lung metastasis. Using this regimen and single cell RNA sequencing we characterized tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) including helper T cells and antigen-presenting B cells that were highly enriched in good responders to combination therapy. Using high dimensional imaging techniques, we identified the close spatial localization of B220+ CD86+ activated B cells and CD4+ T cells in tertiary lymphoid structures that were present up to 6 weeks post-treatment in one model that also exhibited long-term tumor regression post-treatment. We also characterized the transcriptional and metabolic heterogeneity of TAMS in these two closely related claudin-low/mesenchymal subtype tumor models with differential treatment responses. A murine TAM signature derived from the T12 model is highly expressed and conserved in human claudin-low breast cancers, and high expression of the T12 signature correlated with reduced overall survival. This T12 tumor TAM signature may help identify human claudin-low breast cancer patients that will benefit from the combination of cyclophosphamide and anti-CSF1R therapy. These studies illustrate the complexity of the tumor immune microenvironment and highlight different immune responses that result from rationale combinations of immunotherapy.\n\nSignificanceA treatment regimen that harnessed the immunostimulatory effects of cyclophosphamide coupled with the inhibition of CSF1R was used to successfully treat several highly aggressive claudin-low TNBC murine mammary tumors and lung metastasis.",

    "abstract": "The blenniids of the genus Scartichthys are one of the most common fishes of Central and South American Pacific coastal reefs. This being said, Scartichthys spp. remain difficult to identify in the field, and identification is particularly challenging across the ca. 6000 km where three of the four currently accepted species are known to occur in sympatry. A reason for this is that the main taxonomic characters from traditional taxonomy are indeed elusive. Additionally, At the same time, species can display multiple colour patterns in the field, depending on their ontogenetic stage, habitat association, and reproductive behaviour. Overall, molecular characterization is warranted to help address these issues. Here, we have used a novel approach to revise the genus by combining colouration, morphological, and molecular data of representative specimens of the four currently valid species and seven described colour patterns. From this, we show that only three of the four species should be considered as valid; Scartichthys gigas (Steindachner, 1876), S. variolatus (Valenciennes, 1836), and S. viridis (Valenciennes, 1836); while S. crapulatus Williams 1990 should be synonymized with S. viridis. In the same way, our analyses show that one of the colour patterns attributed so far only to S. gigas is characteristic of the juvenile stages of S. viridis. Our time-calibrated phylogeny shows that this genus is relatively young and that the estimated time of divergence between Scartichthys gigas and S. viridis is around 1.71 Ma. In comparison, the Desventuradas and Juan Fernandez Islands endemic S. variolatus diverged about 1.95 Ma. Our results help to clarify the taxonomy of Scartichthys.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe blenniids of the genus Scartichthys are one of the most common fishes of Central and South American Pacific coastal reefs. Here we provide an updated phylogeny of this genus, comparing for the first time morphological, coloration, and molecular data in combination to resolve a 30-year-old discord among ecologists and taxonomists and discuss the potential underlying evolutionary processes that led to their presentday distribution.",

    "abstract": "There is ample support for developmental regulation of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). To examine how cell lineage controls GSC function we have performed a cross-species epigenome analysis of mouse and human GSC cultures. We have analyzed and compared the chromatin-accessibility landscape of nine mouse GSC cultures of defined cell of origin and 60 patient-derived GSC cultures by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq). This uncovered a variability of both mouse and human GSC cultures that was different from transcriptome analysis and better at predicting functional subgroups. In both species the chromatin accessibility-guided clusters were predominantly determined by distal regulatory element (DRE) regions, displayed contrasting sets of transcription factor binding motifs, and exhibited different functional and drug-response properties. Cross-species analysis of DRE regions in accessible chromatin revealed conserved epigenetic regulation of mouse and human GSCs. Human ATAC-seq data produced three distinct clusters with significant overlap to our previous mouse cell of origin- based stratification, where two of the clusters displayed significantly different patient survival. We conclude that epigenetic regulation of GSCs primarily is dictated by developmental origin which controls key GSC properties and affects therapeutic response.",

    "abstract": "Activation of microglia, the brains innate immune cells, is a prominent pathological feature in tauopathies, including Alzheimers disease. How microglia activation contributes to tau toxicity remains largely unknown. Here we show that nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-{kappa}B) signaling, activated by tau, drives microglial-mediated tau propagation and toxicity. Constitutive activation of microglial NF-{kappa}B exacerbated, while inactivation diminished, tau seeding and spreading in PS19 mice, consistent with the observation that NF-{kappa}B activation accelerates processing of internalized tau fibrils in primary microglia. Remarkably, inhibition of microglial NF-{kappa}B specifically also rescued tau-mediated learning and memory deficits, and restored overall transcriptomic changes while increasing tau inclusions. On a single cell level, we discovered that tau-associated disease states in microglia were diminished by NF-{kappa}B inactivation and further transformed by constitutive NF-{kappa}B activation. Our study establishes a central role for microglial NF-{kappa}B signaling in mediating tau toxicity in tauopathy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDevelopmental brain tumors harboring BRAFV600E somatic mutation are diverse. Here, we describe molecular factors that determine BRAFV600E-induced tumor biology and function.\n\nMethodsIntraventricular in utero electroporation in combination with the piggyBac transposon system is employed as a tool to generate developmental brain neoplasms. In vivo tumor growth is monitored by using the infrared fluorescent protein (iRFP). Lineage inference is carried out by using the Brainbow transgene. Neural activity from tumor slices is assessed by multielectrode array. RNA sequencing is exploited to analyze the induced neoplasms at the transcriptomic level.\n\nResultsBRAFV600E in murine neural progenitors only in concert with active PI3K/mTOR-signaling through constitutively phosphorylated Akt-kinase (pAkt) elicits benign neoplasms composed of enlarged dysmorphic neurons and neoplastic astroglia recapitulating ganglioglioma (GG). Purely glial tumors partially resembling polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumors of the young (PLNTYs) emerge from BRAFV600E alone. Additional somatic Trp53-loss is sufficient to induce anaplastic GGs (aGGs) with glioneuronal clonality. Functionally, only BRAFV600E/pAkt tumors intrinsically generate substantial neuronal activity and show enhanced relay to adjacent tissue conferring high epilepsy propensity. In contrast, PLNTY- and aGG-models lack significant spike activity, which appears in line with the glial differentiation of the former and a dysfunctional tissue structure combined with reduced neuronal transcript signatures in the latter.\n\nConclusionmTOR-signaling and Trp53-loss critically determine the biological diversity and electrical activity of BRAFV600E-induced tumors.\n\nKey pointsO_LIIUE of BRAFV600E and activation of mTOR leads to ganglioglioma (GG)-like tumors, while BRAFV600E alone give rise to PLNTY-like neoplasms.\nC_LIO_LIAnaplastic GGs depend on the Trp53 deletion in combination to BRAFV600E and PI3K-mTOR signaling cascade.\nC_LI\n\nImportance of the StudyGlioneuronal tumors are challenging with respect to biological behavior and seizure emergence. While BRAFV600E in murine neural precursors induces oligoid tumors, it requires an overactivation of PI3K/mTOR-signaling for the development of hyperexcitable gangliogliomas and additional Trp53-loss for anaplastic transformation.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus velezensis is considered as model species belonging to the so-called B. subtilis complex that typically evolved to dwell in the soil rhizosphere niche and establish intimate association with plant roots. This bacterium provides protection to its natural host against diseases and represents one of the most promising biocontrol agents. However, the molecular basis of the cross-talk that this bacterium establishes with its natural host has been poorly investigated. We show here that these plant-associated bacteria have evolved some polymer-sensing system to perceive their host and that in response, they increase the production of the surfactin-type lipopeptide. Furthermore, we demonstrate that surfactin synthesis is favoured upon growth on root exudates and that this lipopeptide is a key component used by the bacterium to optimize biofilm formation, motility and early root colonization. In this specific nutritional context, the bacterium also modulates qualitatively the pattern of surfactin homologues co-produced in planta and mainly forms variants that are the most active at triggering plant immunity. Surfactin represents a shared good as it reinforces the defensive capacity of the host.\n\nImportanceWithin the plant-associated microbiome, some bacterial species are of particular interest due to the disease protective effect they provide via direct pathogen suppression and/or stimulation of host immunity. While these biocontrol mechanisms are quite well characterized, we still poorly understand the molecular basis of the cross talk these beneficial bacteria initiate with their host. Here we show that the model species Bacillus velezensis stimulates production of the surfactin lipopeptide upon sensing pectin as cell surface molecular pattern and upon feeding on root exudates. Surfactin favors bacterial rhizosphere fitness on one hand and primes the plant immune system on the other hand. Our data therefore illustrate how both partners use this multifunctional compound as unique shared good to sustain mutualistic interaction.",

    "abstract": "Genetic differences are a primary reason for differences in the susceptibility and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Because induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells maintain the genetic information of the donor, they can be used to model individual differences in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in vitro. Notably, undifferentiated human iPS cells themselves cannot be infected bySARS-CoV-2. Using adenovirus vectors, here we found that human iPS cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (ACE2-iPS cells) can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In infected ACE2-iPS cells, the expression of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, the budding of viral particles, the production of progeny virus, double membrane spherules, and double-membrane vesicles were confirmed. We also evaluated COVID-19 therapeutic drugs in ACE2-iPS cells and confirmed the strong antiviral effects of Remdesivir, EIDD-2801, and interferon-beta. In addition, we performed SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments on ACE2-iPS/ES cells from 8 individuals. Male iPS/ES cells were more capable of producing the virus as compared with female iPS/ES cells. These findings suggest that ACE2-iPS cells can not only reproduce individual differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, but they are also a useful resource to clarify the causes of individual differences in COVID-19 due to genetic differences.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/432218v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (112K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@165ec06org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6a9d67org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1840dd3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a7a4bb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Pigment organelles of vertebrates belong to the lysosome-related organelle (LRO) family, of which melanin-producing melanosomes are the prototypes. While their anabolism has been extensively unraveled through the study of melanosomes in skin melanocytes, their catabolism remains poorly known. Here, we tap into the unique ability of crab spiders to reversibly change body coloration to examine the catabolism of their pigment organelles. By combining ultrastructural and metal analyses on high-pressure frozen integuments, we first assess whether pigment organelles of crab spiders belong to the LRO family and, second, how their catabolism is intracellularly processed. Using scanning-transmission electron microscopy, electron tomography and nanoscale Synchrotron-based scanning X-ray fluorescence, we show that pigment organelles possess ultrastructural and chemical hallmarks of LROs, including intraluminal vesicles and metal deposits, similar to melanosomes. Monitoring ultrastructural changes during bleaching suggests that the catabolism of pigment organelles involves the degradation and removal of their intraluminal content, possibly through lysosomal mechanisms. In contrast to skin melanosomes, anabolism and catabolism of pigments proceed within the same cell without requiring either cell death or secretion/phagocytosis. Our work hence provides support for the hypothesis that the endolysosomal system is fully functionalized for within-cell turnover of pigments, leading to functional maintenance under adverse conditions and phenotypic plasticity. First formulated for eye melanosomes in the context of human vision, the hypothesis of intracellular turnover of pigments gets unprecedented strong support from pigment organelles of spiders.",

Both genetic and environmental factors appear to contribute to the development of this disease. Specifically, pathological levels of biomechanical stress on joints play a notable role in disease initiation and progression. Population-level gene expression studies of cartilage cells experiencing biomechanical stress may uncover gene-by-environment interactions relevant to OA and human joint health. To build a foundation for such studies, we applied differentiation protocols to develop an in vitro system of chondrogenic cell lines (iPSC-chondrocytes). We characterized gene regulatory responses of three human iPSC-chondrocyte lines to cyclic tensile strain treatment. We measured the contribution of biological and technical factors to gene expression variation in this system and, even in this small sample, found several genes that exhibit inter-individual expression differences in response to mechanical strain, including genes previously implicated in OA. Expanding this system to include iPSC-chondrocytes from a larger number of individuals will allow us to characterize and better understand gene-by-environment interactions related to OA and joint health.",

Here, we show the unprecedented capability of two Organs-on-Chips to evaluate the safety profile of T-cell bispecific antibodies (TCBs) targeting tumor antigens. Although promising for cancer immunotherapy, TCBs are associated with an on-target, off-tumor risk due to low levels of expression of tumor antigens in healthy tissues. We leveraged in vivo target expression and toxicity data of TCBs targeting folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) to design and validate human immunocompetent Organs-on-Chips safety platforms. We discovered that the Lung-Chip and Intestine-Chip could reproduce and predict target-dependent TCB safety liabilities, based on sensitivity to key determinants thereof, such as target expression and antibody affinity. These novel tools broaden the research options available for mechanistic understandings of engineered therapeutic antibodies and assessing safety in tissues susceptible to adverse events.",

    "abstract": "Both theoretical and empirical work suggests that offspring sex ratio has important consequences on fitness. Within insects, gregarious parasitoids with haplodiploid sex determination represent an ideal model for studying the decision-making process behind the assignment of offspring sex. To gain insight into the offspring sex ratio of gregarious parasitoids, we performed experiments on Anaphes flavipes, interpreting our results through a two-generation approach. We confirm the existence of a relationship between offspring sex ratio and clutch size: the proportion of males increases with larger clutch size. Based on this finding, we assumed that the proportion of males among one females offspring would also increase with external factors such as a low population density of the host or the presence of the hosts predator, which may pressure the mothers to lay a higher-sized clutch. Contrary to our initial expectations, we show that if it is the pressure of external factors that leads to an increase in clutch size, these larger clutches tend to be more female-biased and the overall offspring sex ratio of a particular female does not change. While in our previous work, we showed that higher clutch sizes reduce body sizes of the offspring and their future fertility, here we conclude that the differences in fertility affect the offspring sex ratio. Taken together, we highlight our two-generation approach which reveals that while the above external factors do not affect the sex ratio of A. flavipes in the F1 generation, they do have an effect in the F2 generation.",

    "abstract": "Running stably on uneven natural terrain takes skillful control and was critical for human evolution. Even as runners circumnavigate hazardous obstacles such as steep drops, they must contend with uneven ground that is gentler but still destabilizing. We do not know how footsteps are guided based on the uneven topography of the ground and how those choices influence stability. Therefore, we studied human runners on trail-like undulating uneven terrain and measured their energetics, kinematics, ground forces, and stepping patterns. We find that runners do not selectively step on more level ground areas. Instead, the bodys mechanical response, mediated by the control of leg compliance, helps maintain stability without requiring precise regulation of footsteps. Furthermore, their overall kinematics and energy consumption on uneven terrain showed little change from flat ground. These findings may explain how runners remain stable on natural terrain while devoting attention to tasks besides guiding footsteps.",

Removal of sialic acids enhances T cell activation and enhances the activity of effector T cells made hypofunctional via chronic viral infection through a mechanism that is synergistic with antibody blockade of the inhibitory PD-1 axis.

Binding energy constants of these polyphenols to the CoV-2 Spike S1 RBD and ACE-2proteinwere calculated separately as molecular docking study using AutoDock 4.2 molecular docking software. In addition, pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness properties of these eight polyphenols were calculated according to the SwissADME tool. Binding energy constant of pinocembrin was the highest for both of the receptors, followed by chrysin, CAPE and hesperetin. In silico ADME behavior of the eight polyphenols were found potential ability to work effectively as novel drugs.

    "abstract": "Analysing the flanking sequences surrounding genes of interest is often highly relevant to understanding the role of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in horizontal gene transfer, particular for antimicrobial resistance genes. Here, we present Flanker, a Python package which performs alignment-free clustering of gene flanking sequences in a consistent format, allowing investigation of MGEs without prior knowledge of their structure. These clusters, known as  flank patterns, are based on Mash distances, allowing for easy comparison of similarity across sequences. Additionally, Flanker can be flexibly parameterised to finetune outputs by characterising upstream and downstream regions separately and investigating variable lengths of flanking sequence. We apply Flanker to two recent datasets describing plasmid-associated carriage of important carbapenemase genes (blaOXA-48 and blaKPC-2/3) and show that it successfully identifies distinct clusters of flank patterns, including both known and previously uncharacterised structural variants. For example, Flanker identified four Tn4401 profiles that could not be sufficiently characterised using TETyper or MobileElementFinder, demonstrating the utility of Flanker for flanking gene characterisation. Similarly, using a large (n=226) European isolate dataset, we confirm findings from a previous smaller study demonstrating association between Tn1999.2 and blaOXA-48 upregulation and demonstrate 17 flank patterns (compared to the 5 previously identified). More generally the demonstration in this study that flank patterns are associated with to geographical regions and antibiotic susceptibility phenotypes suggests that they may be useful as epidemiological markers.

    "abstract": "Large-conductance Ca2+- and voltage-gated K+ (BK KCa1.1) channel complexes include pore-forming Slo1  subunits and often auxiliary {beta} subunits, latter of which noticeably modify the channels pharmacological and gating characteristics. In the absence of intracellular Ca2+, {beta}1 and {beta}4 modestly shift the overall voltage dependence of the channel to the positive direction by decreasing the probability that the ion conduction gate is open without any allosteric influence from the channels voltage or Ca2+ sensors. This intrinsic open probability is also critically regulated by the intracellular-facing 329RKK331 segment of human Slo1 (hSlo1) downstream of the transmembrane segment S6 in association with two negatively charged residues in S6 (E321 and E324) (Tian et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 116, 8591-8596, 2019). This study examined how {beta}1/{beta}4 and the RKK segment function together to control the channel gate. With select mutations in the RKK segment, inclusions of {beta}1 or {beta}4 can dramatically increase the intrinsic gate opening probability and shift the overall voltage dependence of the channel to the negative direction by up to 200 mV without Ca2+. This remarkable shift is mediated at least in part by electrostatic interactions between the Slo1 RKK and {beta} N-terminal segments as suggested by the results of double-mutant cycle analysis, ionic strength experiments, and molecular modelling. With or without auxiliary {beta} subunits, the Slo1 RKK and E321/E324 segments are thus critical determinants of the intrinsic open probability of the ion conduction gate and changes in the electrostatic environment near the RKK-EE segments are a potential mechanism of pharmacological gating modifiers.",

    "abstract": "Methamphetamine (Meth) is a powerful illicit psychostimulant, widely used for recreational purposes. Besides disrupting the monoaminergic system and promoting oxidative brain damage, Meth also causes neuroinflammation that contributes to synaptic dysfunction and behavioral deficits. Aberrant activation of microglia, the largest myeloid cell population in the brain, is a common feature in neurological disorders linked to cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the aberrant activation of microglia elicited by Meth in the adult mouse brain. We found that binge Meth exposure caused microgliosis and disrupted risk assessment behavior (a feature that usually occurs in human Meth abusers), both of which required astrocyte-to-microglia crosstalk. Mechanistically, Meth triggered a detrimental increase of glutamate exocytosis from astrocytes (in a manner dependent on TNF production and calcium mobilization), promoting microglial expansion and reactivity. Ablating TNF production or suppressing astrocytic calcium mobilization prevented microglia reactivity and abolished the behavioral phenotype elicited by Meth exposure. Overall, our data indicate that glial crosstalk is critical to relay behavioral alterations caused by acute Meth exposure.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryGlial crosstalk under methamphetamine exposure",

The pathognomonic oncofusion EWSR1-ETS (EWSR1-FLI1/EWSR1-ERG) transcription factors drive EwS by orchestrating an oncogenic transcription program through de novo enhancers. Pharmacological targeting of these oncofusions has been challenged by unstructured prion-like domains and common DNA binding domains in the EWSR1 and ETS protein, respectively. Alternatively, identification and characterization of mediators and downstream targets of EWSR1-FLI1 dependent or independent function could offer novel therapeutic options. By integrative analysis of thousands of transcriptome datasets representing pan-cancer cell lines, primary cancer, metastasis, and normal tissues, we have identified a 32 gene signature (ESS32 - Ewing Sarcoma Specific 32) that could stratify EwS from pan-cancer. Of the ESS32, LOXHD1 - that encodes a stereociliary protein, was the most exquisitely expressed gene in EwS. CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletion or silencing of EWSR1-FLI1 bound upstream de novo enhancer elements in EwS cells led to the loss of LOXHD1 expression and altered the EWSR1-FLI1, MYC, and HIF1 pathway genes, resulting in decreased proliferation and invasion in vitro and in vivo. These observations implicate LOXHD1 as a novel biomarker and a major determinant of EwS metastasis and open up new avenues for developing LOXHD1-targeted drugs or cellular therapies for this deadly disease.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate the effect of biochar, straw and N fertilizer on soil properties, soil respiration and grain yield of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in semi-arid Western Loess Plateau of northwestern China. The two carbon sources (straw and biochar) were applied alone or combined with nitrogen fertilizer (urea, 46% nitrogen [N]), whilst the soil without carbon is made up of nitrogen fertilizer applied at 0, 50 and 100 kg N/ha. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replicates and was conducted in 2014, 2015 and 2016 cropping season. Results showed that the greatest grain yields were found with 100 kg N ha-1 fertilization rate under biochar, straw and soils without carbon, but the greatest effect occurred on the biochar amended soils. Biochar amendment produced the greatest grain yield at 1906 kg ha-1, followed by straw treated soils at 1643 kg ha-1, and soils without carbon the lowest at 1553 kg ha-1. This results is supported by the fact that, biochar amended soils (at 0-10 cm) increased soil organic C by 17.14% and 21.65% compared to straw treated soils and soils without carbon respectively. Seasonal soil respirations were between 19.05% and 23.67% lower in BN100 compared with SN50 and CN100. Soil respiration reduced with increasing N fertilization rates under all treatments, but the greatest effect occurred on biochar plots. Biochar amended soils decreased carbon emission by 26.80% and 9.54% compared to straw treated soils and soils without carbon amendment respectively. Increased grain yield and the decreased carbon emission in BN100 translated into greater carbon emission efficiency (2.88 kg kg-1) which was significantly different compared with the other treatments. Combined application of biochar with 100 kg N ha-1 in rainfed spring wheat was a suitable agricultural practice.",

    "abstract": "Extreme cold and frost cause significant stress to plants which can potentially be lethal. Low temperature freezing stress can cause significant and irreversible damage to plant cells and can induce physiological and metabolic changes that impact on growth and development. Low temperatures cause physiological responses including winter dormancy and autumn cold hardening in strawberry (Fragaria) species, and some diploid F. vesca accessions have been shown to have adapted to low-temperature stresses. To study the genetics of freezing tolerance, a F. vesca mapping population of 142 seedlings segregating for differential responses to freezing stress was raised. The progeny was mapped using  Genotyping-by-Sequencing and a linkage map of 2,918 markers at 851 loci was resolved. The mapping population was phenotyped for freezing tolerance response under controlled and replicated laboratory conditions and subsequent quantitative trait loci analysis using interval mapping revealed a single significant quantitative trait locus on Fvb2 in the physical interval 10.6 Mb and 15.73 Mb on the F. vesca v4.0 genome sequence. This physical interval contained 896 predicted genes, several of which had putative roles associated with tolerance to abiotic stresses including freezing. Differential expression analysis of the 896 QTL-associated gene predictions in the leaves and crowns from  Alta and  NCGR1363 parental genotypes revealed genotype-specific changes in transcript accumulation in response to low temperature treatment as well as expression differences between genotypes prior to treatment for many of the genes. The putative roles, and significant interparental differential expression levels of several of the genes reported here identified them as good candidates for the control of the effects of freezing tolerance at the QTL identified in this investigation and the possible role of these candidate genes in response to freezing stress is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Heritable variation in a genes expression arises from mutations impacting cis- and trans-acting components of its regulatory network, with expression variation often derived from trans-regulatory mutations within species. Here, we investigate how trans-regulatory mutations are distributed within the genome and within a gene regulatory network by identifying and characterizing 69 mutations with trans-regulatory effects on expression of the same focal gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Relative to 1766 mutations without effects on expression of this focal gene, we found that these trans-regulatory mutations were enriched in coding sequences of transcription factors previously predicted to regulate expression of the focal gene. However, over 90% of the trans-regulatory mutations identified mapped to other types of genes involved in diverse biological processes including chromatin state, metabolism and signal transduction. Finally, we find that the genomic distribution of these new regulatory mutations significantly overlaps with the genomic distribution of trans-regulatory variants segregating within S. cerevisiae.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic alterations occur as organisms age, and lead to chromatin deterioration, loss of transcriptional silencing and genomic instability. Dysregulated epigenome has been linked to increased susceptibility to age-related disorders. We aim to characterize the age-dependent changes of the epigenome and, in turn, to understand epigenetic processes that drive aging phenotypes. In this study, we focused on the aging-associated changes in the repressive histone marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in C. elegans. We observed redistribution of of both histone marks, but the changes are more significant for H3K9me3. We further found alteration of heterochromatic boundaries in aged somatic tissues. Interestingly, we discovered that the most significant changes reflected H3K9me3-marked regions that are formed during aging, and are absent in developing worms, which we termed \"aging-associated repressive domains\" (AARDs). These AARDs preferentially occur in genic regions that are marked by high levels of H3K9me2 and H3K36me2 in larval stages. Interestingly, maintenance of high H3K9me2 levels in these regions have been shown to correlate with longer lifespan. Next, we examined whether the changes in repressive histone marks lead to de-silencing of repetitive DNA elements, as reported for several other organisms. We observed increased expression of active repetitive DNA elements but not global re-activation of silent repeats in old worms, likely due to the distributed nature of repetitive elements in the C. elegans genome. Intriguingly, CELE45, a putative short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE), was greatly overexpressed at old age and upon heat stress. SINEs have been suggested to regulate transcription in response to various cellular stresses in mammals, it is likely that CELE45 RNAs also play roles in stress response and aging in C. elegans. Taken together, our study revealed significant and specific age-dependent changes in repressive histone modifications and repetitive elements, providing important insights into aging biology.\n\nAuthor summaryHeterochromatin refers to the portion of the genome that is tightly packed where genes stay silent. Heterochromatin is typically decorated by particular chemical groups called histone modifications, such as trimethylation of lysine 9 or lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K9me3 or H3K27me3). To understand how the heterochromatin landscape may change from a \"youthful\" to an \"aged\" state, we monitored the genome-wide patterns of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 during aging using the genetic model soil worm C. elegans. We found that while H3K27me3 remained relatively stable with age, H3K9me3 showed profound genome-wide redistribution in aged worms. We observed that new H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin preferentially formed in specific gene-rich regions in aged worms. Interestingly, these particular regions were marked by high levels of three other histone modifications when worms were young. This result suggested that H3K9me3 gain during aging is influenced by the gene-specific landscape of histone modifications established at young age rather than occurs in a stochastic manner. In summary, our study discovered reproducible and gene-specific changes in histone modifications that likely contribute to the aging phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, GeneSeek GGP-LDv4 33k single nucleotide polymorphism chip was used to detect runs of homozygosity (ROH) in eight Italian beef cattle breeds; six breeds with distribution limited to Tuscany (Calvana, Mucca Pisana, Pontremolese) or Sardinia (Sarda, Sardo Bruna and Sardo Modicana) and two cosmopolitan breeds (Charolais and Limousine). ROH detection analyses were used to estimate autozygosity and inbreeding and to identify genomic regions with high frequency of ROH, which might reflect selection signatures. Comparative analysis among breeds revealed differences in length and distribution of ROH and inbreeding levels. The Charolais, Limousine, Sarda, and Sardo Bruna breeds were found to have a high frequency of short ROH (30.000); Calvana and Mucca Pisana presented also runs longer than 16 Mbp. The highest level of average genomic inbreeding was observed in Tuscan breeds, around 0.3, while Sardinian and cosmopolitan breeds showed values around 0.2. The population structure and genetic distances were analyzed through principal component analysis and multidimensional scaling analysis, and resulted in a clear separation among the breeds, with clusters related to productive purposes and sample sizes. The frequency of ROH occurrence revealed eight breed-specific genomic regions where genes of potential selective and conservative interest are located (e.g. MYOG, Chitinases (BTA16), TIMELESS, APOF, Olfactory receptors, CACNG2 (BTA5) and Collagens (BTA2)). In all breeds, we found the largest proportion of homozygous by descent segments to be those that represent inbreeding events that occurred around 32 generations ago; with Tuscan breeds also having a significant proportion of segments relating to more recent inbreeding.",

    "abstract": "The Planum Temporale (PT) is one of the key hubs of the language network in the human brain. The gross asymmetry of this perisylvian region toward the left brain was considered as the most emblematic marker of hemispheric specialization of language processes in the brain. Interestingly, this neuroanatomical signature was documented also in newborn infants and preterms, suggesting the early brains readiness for language acquisition. Nevertheless, this latter interpretation was questioned by a recent report in nonhuman primates of a potential similar signature in newborn baboons Papio anubis based on PT surface measures. Whether this \"tip of the iceberg\" PT asymmetry is actually reflecting asymmetry of its underlying grey matter volume remain unclear but critical to investigate potential continuities of cortical specialization with human infants. Here we report a population-level leftward asymmetry of the Planum Temporale grey matter volume in in vivo 34 newborn baboons Papio anubis, which showed intra-individual positive correlation with PT surfaces asymmetry measures but also a more pronounced degree of leftward asymmetry at the population-level. This finding demonstrates that PT leftward structural asymmetry in this Old World monkey species is a robust phenomenon in early primate development, which clearly speaks for a continuity with early human brain specialization. Results also strengthen the hypothesis that early PT asymmetry might be not a human-specific marker for the pre-wired language-ready brain in infants.",

    "abstract": "In multi-talker situations individuals adapt behaviorally to the listening challenge mostly with ease, but how do brain neural networks shape this adaptation? We here establish a long-sought link between large-scale neural communications in electrophysiology and behavioral success in the control of attention in difficult listening situations. In an age-varying sample of N = 154 individuals, we find that connectivity between intrinsic neural oscillations extracted from source-reconstructed electroencephalography is regulated according to the listeners goal during a challenging dual{-} talker task. These dynamics occur as spatially organized modulations in power-envelope correlations of alpha and low-beta neural oscillations during ~2 seconds intervals most critical for listening behavior relative to resting-state baseline. First, left frontoparietal low-beta connectivity (16-24 Hz) increased during anticipation and processing of spatial-attention cue before speech presentation. Second, posterior alpha connectivity (7-11 Hz) decreased during comprehension of competing speech, particularly around target-word presentation. Connectivity dynamics of these networks were predictive of individual differences in the speed and accuracy of target-word identification, respectively, but proved unconfounded by changes in neural oscillatory activity strength. Successful adaptation to a listening challenge thus latches onto two distinct yet complementary neural systems: a beta-tuned frontoparietal network enabling the flexible adaptation to attentive listening state and an alpha-tuned posterior network supporting attention to speech.\n\nSignificance StatementAttending to relevant information during listening is key to human communication. How does this adaptive behavior rely upon neural communications? We here follow up on the long-standing conjecture that, large-scale brain network dynamics constrain our successful adaptation to cognitive challenges. We provide evidence in support of two intrinsic, frequency-specific neural networks that underlie distinct behavioral aspects of successful listening: a beta-tuned frontoparietal network enabling the flexible adaptation to attentive listening state, and an alpha-tuned posterior cortical network supporting attention to speech. These findings shed light on how large-scale neural communication dynamics underlie attentive listening and open new opportunities for brain network-based intervention in hearing loss and its neurocognitive consequences.",

MTs are abundant in chemoresistant gliomas, in particular glioblastomas (GBMs), while they are uncommon in chemosensitive IDH-mutant and 1p/19q co-deleted oligodendrogliomas. To identify potential signaling pathways involved in MT formation we performed a bioinformatics analysis of TCGA data showing that the TGF-{beta} pathway is highly activated in GBMs compared to oligodendroglial tumors. In particular we observed that signaling pathways involved in extracellular matrix organization are differentially expressed between these tumor entities. Using patient-derived GBM stem cell lines, we demonstrated that TGF-{beta}1 stimulation promotes enhanced MT formation and communication via Calcium signaling. Inhibition of the TGF-{beta} pathway significantly reduced MT formation and its associated invasion in vitro and in vivo. Downstream of TGF-{beta}, we identified thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) as a potential mediator of MT formation in GBM through SMAD activation. TSP1 was upregulated upon TGF-{beta} stimulation and enhanced MT formation, which was inhibited by TSP1 shRNAs in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, TGF-{beta} and its downstream mediator TSP1 are important mediators of the MT network in GBM and blocking this pathway could potentially help to break the complex MT driven invasion/ resistance network.",

Here, multiple independent lines of evidence are presented in support of the conclusion that low photorespiratory capacity acts a negative signal to limit photosynthetic capacity acclimation in HL in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using a panel of natural accessions, primary nitrogen (N) assimilation and photorespiration rates early after a shift to growth in HL, as well as activities for key enzymes in these pathways, were shown to positively correlate with the magnitude of the subsequent induction of photosynthetic capacity, which occurred several days later. Time-resolved metabolomic data during acclimation to HL were collected using a strongly acclimating ecotype and a weakly acclimating ecotype, revealing in greater detail the differences in N assimilation, photorespiration, and triose-phosphate utilization pathways underlying efficient photosynthetic capacity acclimation. When shifted into HL growth conditions under non-photorespiratory conditions, weakly acclimating ecotypes and even photorespiratory mutants gained the ability to strongly induce high photosynthetic capacity in HL. Thus, a negative, photorespiration-dependent signal early in the HL shift appears to block photosynthetic capacity acclimation in accessions with low photorespiratory capacity, whereas accessions with high photorespiratory capacity are licensed to increase photosynthetic capacity.",

The ion that drives the rotor has changed over evolutionary timescales but the molecular basis of this selectivity remains unknown.\n\nHere we used CRISPR engineering to replace the native Escherichia coli H+-powered stator with Na+-powered stator genes and report the rapid and spontaneous reversion of our edit in a low sodium environment. We followed the evolution of the stators during their reversion to H+-powered motility and used whole genome and transcriptome sequencing to identify both flagellar- and non-flagellar-associated genes involved in the cells adaptation. Our transplant of an unfit protein and the cells rapid response to this edit demonstrates the adaptability of the stator subunit and highlights the hierarchical modularity of the flagellar motor.",

The choice of such references --i.e., templates-- and atlases is one relevant source of methodological variability across studies, which has recently been brought to attention as an important challenge to reproducibility in neuroscience. TemplateFlow is a publicly available framework for human and nonhuman brain models. The framework combines an open database with software for access, management, and vetting, allowing scientists to distribute their resources under FAIR --findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable-- principles. TemplateFlow supports a multifaceted insight into brains across species, and enables multiverse analyses testing whether results generalize across standard references, scales, and in the long term, species, thereby contributing to increasing the reliability of neuroimaging results.",

    "abstract": "Susceptibility for leishmaniasis is largely dependent on genetic- and immune factors of the host. Despite the previously described association of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene cluster variants as genetic susceptibility factors, little is known on the mechanisms that mediate these associations. To characterize the functionality underpinning these associations between HLA and disease, we predicted the epitope binding repertoires for all known leishmaniasis-associated HLA variants collected in a thorough literature review. We identified several amino acid polymorphisms in the HLA sequences that distinguished protective-from risk-associated HLA-DRB1 alleles. Proteome-wide and multi-species T cell epitope binding predictions were carried out across these alleles, enabling us to map the effects on the epitope binding repertoires. The protective-associated HLA-DRB1 alleles were characterized by common binding core motifs, which map to the identified amino acid polymorphisms. These results strongly suggest that polymorphism in the HLA region, resulting in differential antigen presentation, affects the association between HLA and leishmaniasis disease development. Finally, we established a valuable open-access resource of putative epitopes, of which a set of 14 HLA-unrestricted strong-binding epitopes, conserved across species, were prioritized for further epitope discovery in the search for novel subunit-based vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological disorder associated with iron deficiency and dopaminergic (DAergic) neuronal dysfunction. BTBD9 is a genetic risk factor for RLS. However, its molecular function remains largely unknown. Here, we report the interaction between BTBD9, manganese (Mn) and insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans, mouse Neuro2a cells and humans. We found that elevated Mn downregulated BTBD9 mRNA levels; in turn, BTBD9 expression attenuated Mn-induced cellular stress and dopaminergic neurodegeneration. As Mn is a known co-factor for insulin receptor and IGF-1 receptor, which activates IGF signaling, we posited that BTBD9 negatively regulates IGF signaling. Our results showed that the protective effects of BTBD9 against Mn toxicity were dependent on the forkhead box O (FOXO) protein. Furthermore, BTBD9 overexpression significantly elevated FOXO level and decreased PKB level, while phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) level remained unchanged. We conclude that BTBD9 acts as a key component in the IGF signaling pathway. Meanwhile, the roles of Mn in DAergic neurotoxicity and regulating BTBD9 shed new light on the etiology of RLS.",

    "abstract": "Functional connectivity (FC) has been demonstrated to be varying over time during sensory and cognitive processes. Quantitative examinations of such variations can significantly advance our understanding on large-scale functional organizations and their topological dynamics that support normal brain functional connectome and can be altered in individuals with brain disorders. However, toolboxes that integrate the complete functions for analyzing task-related brain FC, functional network topological properties, and their dynamics, are still lacking. The current study has developed a MATLAB toolbox, the Graph Theoretical Analysis of Task-Related Functional Dynamics (GAT-FD), which consists of four modules for sliding-window analyses, temporal mask generation, estimations of network properties and dynamics, and result display, respectively. All the involved functions have been tested and validated using fMRI data collected from human subjects when performing a block-designed task. The results demonstrated that the GAT-FD allows for effective and quantitative evaluations of the functional network properties and their dynamics during the task period.

    "abstract": "Maintenance of osmotic homeostasis is essential for all organisms, especially for marine animals in the ocean with 30{per thousand} salinity or higher. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that how marine animals adapt to high salinity environment compared to their terrestrial relatives, remain elusive. Here, we investigated marine animals genome-wide transcriptional responses to salinity stresses using an emerging marine nematode model Litoditis marina. We found that the transthyretin-like family genes were significantly increased in both hyposaline and hypersaline conditions, while multiple neurotransmitter receptor and ion transporter genes were down-regulated in both conditions, suggesting the existence of conserved strategies for response to stressful salinity environments in L. marina. Unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis related genes, neuronal related tubulins and intraflagellar transport genes were specifically up-regulated in hyposaline treated worms, while exhibited the opposite regulation in hypersaline condition. By contrast, cuticle related collagen genes were enriched and up-regulated for hypersaline response, interestingly, the expression of these collagen genes was significantly decreased in hyposaline condition. Given a wide range of salinity tolerance of the marine nematodes, this study and further genetic analysis of key gene(s) of osmoregulation in L. marina will likely provide important insights into biological evolution and environmental adaptation mechanisms in nematodes and other invertebrate animals in general.",

    "abstract": "Whether and how certain transposable elements with viral origins, such as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) dormant in our genomes, can become awakened and contribute to the aging process are largely unknown. In human senescent cells, we found that HERVK (HML-2), the most recently integrated human ERVs, are unlocked to transcribe viral genes and produce retrovirus-like particles (RVLPs). These HERVK RVLPs constitute a transmissible message to elicit senescence phenotypes in young cells, which can be blocked by neutralizing antibodies. Activation of ERVs was also observed in organs of aged primates and mice, as well as in human tissues and serum from the elderly. Their repression alleviates cellular senescence and tissue degeneration and, to some extent, organismal aging. These findings indicate that the resurrection of ERVs is a hallmark and driving force of cellular senescence and tissue aging.\n\nIn briefLiu and colleagues uncover the ways in which de-repression of human endogenous retrovirus triggers cellular senescence and tissue aging; the findings provide fresh insights into therapeutic strategies for alleviating aging.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDerepression of the endogenous retrovirus contributes to programmed aging\nC_LIO_LIUpregulation of HERVK triggers the innate immune response and cellular senescence\nC_LIO_LIExtracellular HERVK retrovirus-like particles induce senescence in young cells\nC_LIO_LIEndogenous retrovirus serves as a potential target to alleviate agings\nC_LI\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=194 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/432260v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (64K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@31d384org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13594c0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b8e070org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@196e5be_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Our analyses included characterization of transmission bottleneck sizes across a range of variant calling thresholds and examination of patterns of shared low-frequency variants between transmission pairs in cases where de novo genetic variation was present in the recipient. From these analyses, among others, we found that SARS-CoV-2 transmission bottlenecks are instead likely to be very tight, on the order of 1-3 virions. These findings have important consequences for understanding how SARS-CoV-2 evolves between hosts and the processes shaping genetic variation observed at the population level.",

These data reveal a set of insightful gene expression modules and representative gene biomarkers for human immune system aging from Asian and Caucasian ancestry, respectively. Among them, the aging-specific modules show an age-related gene expression variation spike around early-seventies. In addition, it is not known whether Asian and Caucasian immune systems go through similar gene expression changes throughout their lifespan, and to what extent these aging-associated changes are shared among ethnicities. We find the top hub genes including NUDT7, CLPB, OXNAD1 and MLLT3 are shared between Asian and Caucasian aging related modules and further validated in human PBMCs from different age groups.

    "abstract": "DNA replication in all organisms must overcome nucleoprotein blocks to complete genome duplication. Accessory replicative helicases in Escherichia coli, Rep and UvrD, help replication machinery overcome blocks by removing incoming nucleoprotein complexes or aiding the re-initiation of replication. Mechanistic details of Rep function have emerged from recent live cell studies; however, the division of UvrD between its multiple activities in DNA repair and its role as an accessory helicase remains unclear in live cells. Here, by integrating super-resolved single-molecule fluorescence microscopy with biochemical analysis, we find that UvrD self-associates into tetrameric assemblies and, unlike Rep, is not recruited to a specific replisome protein despite being found at approximately 80% of replication forks. Instead, its recruitment to forks is likely mediated by the very high frequency of replication blocks due to DNA bound proteins, including RNA polymerase and DNA damage. Deleting rep and DNA repair factor genes mutS and uvrA, and inhibiting transcription through RNA polymerase mutation and antibiotic inhibition, indicates that the level of UvrD at the fork is dependent on its function. Our findings show that UvrD is recruited to sites of nucleoprotein blocks via different mechanisms to Rep and plays a multi-faceted role in ensuring successful DNA replication.",

The identification of individuals buried in mass graves has long benefitted from traditional historical, archaeological, anthropological and paleopathological techniques. The addition of novel methods including genetic, genomic and isotopic geochemistry have renewed interest in solving unidentified mass graves. In this study, we demonstrate that the combined use of these techniques allows the identification of the individuals found in two Breton historical mass graves, where one method alone would not have revealed the importance of this discovery. The skeletons likely belong to soldiers from the two enemy armies who fought during a major event of Breton history: the siege of Rennes in 1491, which ended by the wedding of the Duchess of Brittany with the King of France and signaled the end of the independence of the region. Our study highlights the value of interdisciplinary approaches with a particular emphasis on increasingly accurate isotopic markers.

Here we report that the heat shock transcription factor HSF-1, activated in the C. elegans maternal germline upon stress, epigenetically programs the insulin-like receptor daf-2 by increasing repressive H3K9me2 levels throughout the daf-2 gene. This increase occurs by the recruitment of the C. elegans SETDB1 homolog MET-2 by HSF-1. Increased H3K9me2 levels at daf-2 persist in offspring to downregulate daf-2, activate the C. elegans FOXO ortholog DAF-16 and enhance offspring stress resilience. Thus, HSF-1 activity in the mother promotes the early life programming of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway and determines the strategy of stress resilience in progeny.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryHSF-1 recruits MET-2 to silence daf-2 and mediate early life programming of C. elegans upon stress",

Several cellular pathways co-opted by Vpu have been identified, but the picture of Vpus itinerary and activities within membrane systems remains incomplete. Here, we used fusion proteins of Vpu and the enzyme ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2) to compare the ultrastructural locations and the proximal proteomes of wild type Vpu and Vpu-mutants. The proximity-omes of the proteins correlated with their ultrastructural locations and placed wild type Vpu near both retromer and ESCRT-0 complexes. Hierarchical clustering of protein abundances across the mutants was essential to interpreting the data and identified Vpu degradation-targets including CD4, HLA-C, and SEC12 as well as Vpu-cofactors including HGS, STAM, clathrin, and PTPN23, an ALIX-like protein. The Vpu-directed degradation of BST-2 required PTPN23 but not the retromer subunits. These data suggest that Vpu directs targets from sorting endosomes to degradation at multi-vesicular bodies via ESCRT-0 and PTPN23.\n\nAuthor SummaryVpu triggers the degradation or mis-localization of proteins important to the hosts immune response. Vpu acts as an adaptor, linking cellular protein targets to the ubiquitination and membrane trafficking machinery. Vpu has been localized to various cellular membrane systems. By fusing wild type Vpu and Vpu-mutants to the enzyme ascorbate peroxidase, we defined the cellular proteome in proximity to Vpu and correlated this with the proteins location. We found that wild type Vpu is proximal to ESCRT proteins, retromer complexes, and sorting and late endosomal proteins. Functionally, we found that the Vpu-mediated degradation of the innate defense protein BST-2 required PTPN23, an ALIX-like protein, consistent with our observation of Vpus presence at the limiting membranes of multi-vesicular bodies.",
