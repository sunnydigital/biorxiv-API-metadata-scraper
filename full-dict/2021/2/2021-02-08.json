    "abstract": "Placements are often an extra-curricular activity of a science degree. This study reports on the outcomes of a final year credit-bearing 6-week placement module that was specifically designed to develop and enhance students employability skills. A key element of this module was that the student placements were not just evaluated from a science perspective, but with an emphasis on meaningful reflection and evaluation of employability skills development. Students recorded their levels of confidence in skills before, during and after the placement via an Online Reflective Log, as part of a modules summative assessment. First, results showed that taking part in the placement and conducting their own independent research helped students to make connections between their scientific knowledge, otherwise constrained within the walls of the undergraduate science lab, and the wider impact of their research on society. Another theme that emerged concerned career choices and aspirations, and the placement experience either confirmed prior choices or opened new horizons. The Online Reflective Log helped students to feel supported by their university supervisor who were at a distance, while feedback on their tasks challenged them to reflect on the scientific and personal skills as they were engaged in scientific activities during placement. Students agreed that they had further developed their employability skills during the placement. Students acknowledged it was challenging to have to acquire evidence of skills development but appreciated the usefulness of this reflection in relation to their future careers.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule (SM) approaches have provided valuable mechanistic information on many biophysical systems. As technological advances lead to ever-larger datasets, tools for rapid analysis and identification of molecules exhibiting the behavior of interest are increasingly important. In many cases the underlying mechanism is unknown, making unsupervised techniques desirable. The Divisive Segmentation and Clustering (DISC) algorithm is one such unsupervised method that idealizes noisy SM time series much faster than computationally intensive approaches without sacrificing accuracy. However, DISC relies on a user selected objective criterion (OC) to guide its estimation of the ideal time series. Here, we explore how different OCs affect DISCs performance for data typical of SM fluorescence imaging experiments. We find that OCs differing in their penalty for model complexity each optimize DISCs performance for time series with different properties such as signal-to-noise and number of sample points. Using a machine learning approach, we generate a decision boundary that allows unsupervised selection of OC based on the input time series to maximize performance for different types of data. This is particularly relevant for SM fluorescence datasets which often have signal-to-noise near the derived decision boundary and include time series of nonuniform length due to stochastic bleaching. Our approach allows unsupervised per-molecule optimization of DISC, which will substantially assist rapid analysis of high-throughput single-molecule datasets with noisy samples and nonuniform time windows.",

However, the antigens recognized by such immunoglobulins (Ig) and their biological significance remain largely unknown. We computationally inferred the paired sequence of thousands of clonally expanded Ig using bulk RNA sequencing data from solid tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). After expressing 283 Ig as recombinant antibodies in mammalian cells, we individually tested them against a library of twenty thousands full-length human proteins and an additional library of six thousand structurally intact membrane proteins, thus identifying their candidate target antigens. Using surface plasmon resonance we then confirmed 16 high-affinity antibodies that bind to their targets with KD in the nanomolar range. Our work provides insights into the antigens that drive B cell responses in human cancers, while also obtaining fully human, high-affinity recombinant antibodies against them.",

    "abstract": "O_LIThe phellem is a specialized boundary tissue providing the first line of defense against abiotic and biotic stresses in organs undergoing secondary growth. Phellem cells undergo several differentiation steps, which include cell wall suberization, cell expansion and programmed cell death. Yet, the molecular players acting particularly in phellem cell differentiation remain poorly described, particularly in the widely used model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.\nC_LIO_LIUsing specific marker lines we followed the onset and progression of phellem differentiation in A. thaliana roots, and further targeted the translatome of new developed phellem cells using Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification followed by mRNA sequencing (TRAP-SEQ).\nC_LIO_LIWe showed that phellem suberization is initiated early after phellogen (cork cambium) division. The specific translational landscape was organized in three main domains related to energy production, synthesis and transport of cell wall components, and response to stimulus. Novel players in phellem differentiation, related to suberin monomer transport and assembly, as well as novel transcription regulators were identified.\nC_LIO_LIThis strategy provided an unprecedented resolution of the transcriptome of developing phellem cells, giving a detailed and specific view on the molecular mechanisms controlling cell differentiation in periderm tissues of the model plant Arabidopsis.\nC_LI\n\nSignificance statementTo improve the understanding of phellem differentiation into a suberized protective layer, we followed the establishment of periderm in Arabidopsis roots and sequenced the phellem-specific translatome. We found that phellem suberization occurs shortly after pericycle cell divisions with the induction of pivotal suberin biosynthesis genes. In parallel, we detected the activation of three central genetic modules acting throughout the phellem differentiation. This study provides a unique and targeted genetic resource for further functional studies of phellem tissues.",

    "abstract": "Although many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) exhibit lineage-specific expression, the vast majority remain functionally uncharacterized in the context of development. Here, we report the first described human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines to repress (CRISPRi) or activate (CRISPRa) transcription during differentiation into all three germ layers, facilitating the modulation of lncRNA expression during early development. We performed an unbiased, genome-wide CRISPRi screen targeting thousands of lncRNA loci expressed during endoderm differentiation. While dozens of lncRNA loci were required for proper differentiation, most differentially expressed lncRNAs were not, supporting the necessity for functional screening instead of relying solely on gene expression analyses. In parallel, we developed a clustering approach to infer mechanisms of action of lncRNA hits based on a variety of genomic features. We subsequently identified and validated FOXD3-AS1 as a functional lncRNA essential for pluripotency and differentiation. Taken together, the cell lines and methodology described herein can be adapted to discover and characterize novel regulators of differentiation into any lineage.",

    "abstract": "I.Almond (Prunus dulcis [Mill.] D.A.Webb) exhibits an age-related disorder called non-infectious bud-failure (BF) affecting vegetative bud development and nut yield. The underlying cause of BF remains unknown but is hypothesized to be associated with heritable epigenetic mechanisms. To address this disorder and its epigenetic components, we utilized a monozygotic twin study model profiling genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression in two sets of twin almonds discordant for BF-exhibition. Analysis of DNA methylation patterns show that BF-exhibition and methylation, namely hypomethylation, are not independent phenomena. Transcriptomic data generated from the twin pairs also shows genome-wide differential gene expression associated with BF-exhibition. After identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in each twin pair, a comparison revealed 170 shared DMRs between the two twin pairs. These DMRs and the associated genetic components may play a role in BF-exhibition. A subset of 52 shared DMRs are in close proximity to genes involved in meristem maintenance, cell cycle regulation, and response to heat stress. Annotation of specific genes included involvement in processes like cell wall development, calcium ion signaling, and DNA methylation. Results of this work support the hypothesis that BF-exhibition is associated with hypomethylation in almond, and identified DMRs and differentially expressed genes can serve as potential biomarkers to assess BF-potential in almond germplasm. Our results contribute to an understanding of the contribution of epigenetic disorders in agricultural performance and biological fitness of perennials.\n\nII. SignificanceThis study examines epigenetic components underlying noninfectious bud failure, an aging-related disorder affecting almond. Results from this work contribute to our understanding of the implications of DNA methylation on agricultural production, namely perennial fruit and nut production, due to effects on growth, development, and reproduction. Describing the methylome of discordant, monozygotic twin almonds enables the study of genomic features underlying noninfectious bud failure in this economically important crop.",

    "abstract": "1Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) motion artefacts frequently complicate structural and diffusion MRI analyses. While diffusion imaging is easily  scrubbed of motion affected volumes, the same is not true for structural images. Structural images are critical to most diffusion-imaging pipelines thus their corruption can lead to disproportionate data loss. To enable diffusion-image processing when structural images have been corrupted, we propose a means by which synthetic structural images can be generated from diffusion MRI. This technique combines multi-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution, which is central to many existing diffusion analyses, with the Bloch equations which allow simulation of MRI intensities given scanner parameters and magnetic resonance (MR) tissue properties. We applied this technique to 32 scans, including those acquired on different scanners, with different protocols and with pathology present. The resulting synthetic T1w and T2w images were visually convincing and exhibited similar tissue contrast to acquired structural images. These were also of sufficient quality to drive a Freesurfer-based tractographic analysis. In this analysis, probabilistic tractography connecting the thalamus to the primary sensorimotor cortex was delineated with Freesurfer, using either real or synthetic structural images. Tractography for real and synthetic conditions was largely identical in terms of both voxels encountered (Dice 0.88 - 0.95) and mean fractional anisotropy (intrasubject absolute difference 0.00 - 0.02). We provide executables for the proposed technique in the hope that these may aid the community in analysing datasets where structural image corruption is common, such as studies of children or cognitively impaired persons.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe propose a simple means of synthesizing T1w and T2w images from diffusion data\nC_LIO_LIThe proposed method worked well for a variety of acquisitions\nC_LIO_LISynthetic images showed tissue contrast akin to acquired images\nC_LIO_LISynthetic images were high enough quality to be used for Freesurfer seeded diffusion tractography\nC_LIO_LIThis method enables analysis of datasets where motion has corrupted acquired structural MRIs\nC_LI",
