    "abstract": "The development of allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies for off-the-shelf use is a major goal yet faces two main immunological challenges, namely the risk of graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) induction by the transferred cells and the rejection by the host immune system limiting their persistence. We demonstrate that allogeneic CAR-engineered invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, a cell population without GvHD-induction potential that displays immunomodulatory properties, exerted potent direct and indirect antitumor activity in murine models of B-cell lymphoma when administered across major MHC-barriers. In addition to their known direct cytotoxic effect, allogeneic CAR iNKT cells induced tumor-specific antitumor immunity through host CD8 T cell cross-priming, resulting in a potent antitumor effect lasting longer than the physical persistence of the allogeneic cells. The utilization of off-the-shelf allogeneic CAR iNKT cells could meet significant unmet needs in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "The subseafloor is a vast habitat that supports microorganisms that have a global scale impact on geochemical cycles. Many of the endemic microbial communities inhabiting the subseafloor consist of small populations under growth-limited conditions. For small populations, stochastic evolutionary events can have large impacts on intraspecific population dynamics and allele frequencies. These conditions are fundamentally different from those experienced by most microorganisms in surface environments, and it is unknown how small population sizes and growth-limiting conditions influence evolution and population structure in the subsurface. Using a two-year, high-resolution environmental time-series, we examine the dynamics of microbial populations from cold, oxic crustal fluids collected from the subseafloor site North Pond, located near the mid-Atlantic ridge. Our results reveal rapid shifts in overall abundance, allele frequency, and strain abundance across the time points observed, with evidence for homologous recombination between coexisting lineages. We show that the subseafloor aquifer is a dynamic habitat that hosts microbial metapopulations that disperse frequently through the crustal fluids, enabling gene flow and recombination between microbial populations. The dynamism and stochasticity of microbial population dynamics in North Pond suggests that these forces are important drivers in the evolution of microbial populations in the vast subseafloor habitat.\n\nSignificance StatementThe cold, oxic subseafloor is an understudied habitat that is difficult to access, yet important to global biogeochemical cycles and starkly different compared to microbial habitats on the surface of the Earth. Our understanding of microbial evolution and population dynamics is largely molded by studies of microbes living in surface habitats that can host 10-1,000 times more microbial biomass than is frequently observed in the subsurface. This study provides an opportunity to observe population dynamics within a low biomass, growth-limited environment and reveals that microbial populations in the subseafloor are influenced by changes in selection pressure and gene sweeps. In addition, recombination between strains that have dispersed from elsewhere within the aquifer has an important impact on the evolution of microbial populations. Much of the microbial life on the planet exists under growth-limited conditions and the subseafloor provides a natural laboratory to explore how life evolves in such environments.",

    "abstract": "Precise interpretation of the effects of protein-truncating variants (PTVs) is important for accurate determination of variant impact. Current methods for assessing the ability of PTVs to induce nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) focus primarily on the position of the variant in the transcript. We used RNA-sequencing of the Genotype Tissue Expression v8 cohort to compute the efficiency of NMD using allelic imbalance for 2,320 rare (genome aggregation database minor allele frequency <=1%) PTVs across 809 individuals in 49 tissues. We created an interpretable predictive model using penalized logistic regression in order to evaluate the comprehensive influence of variant annotation, tissue, and inter-individual variation on NMD. We found that variant position, allele frequency, including ultra-rare and singleton variants, and conservation were predictive of allelic imbalance. Furthermore, we found that NMD effects were highly concordant across tissues and individuals. Due to this high consistency, we demonstrate in silico that utilizing peripheral tissues or cell lines provides accurate prediction of NMD for PTVs.",

    "abstract": "Ultraviolet A light is commonly emitted by UV-nail polish dryers with recent reports suggesting that long-term use may increase the risk for developing skin cancer. However, no experimental evaluation has been conducted to reveal the effect of radiation emitted by UV-nail polish dryers on mammalian cells. Here, we show that irradiation by a UV-nail polish dryer causes high levels of reactive oxygen species, consistent with 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. Analysis of somatic mutations reveals a dose-dependent increase of C:G>A:T substitutions in irradiated samples with mutagenic patterns similar to mutational signatures attributed to reactive oxygen species. In summary, this study demonstrates that radiation emitted by UV-nail polish dryers can both damage DNA and permanently engrave mutations on the genomes of mammalian cells. These results have far-reaching implications in regard to public health and to preventing skin cancer due to consumer-based exposure to ultraviolet light from artificial sources.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEchinococcus multilocularis causes alveolar echinococcosis (AE), a rising zoonotic disease in the northern hemisphere. Treatment of this fatal disease is limited to chemotherapy using benzimidazoles and surgical intervention, with relatively frequent disease recurrence in cases without radical surgery. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying E. multilocularis infections and host-parasite interactions aids developing novel therapeutic options. This study explored an involvement of unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum-stress (ERS) during E. multilocularis infection in mice.\n\nMethodsE. multilocularis- and mock-infected C57BL/6 mice were subdivided six weeks after infection into vehicle and albendazole (ABZ) treated groups. Eight weeks later, liver tissue was collected to examine mRNA, microRNA (miR) and protein expression of UPR- and ERS-related genes.\n\nResultsE. multilocularis infection upregulated UPR- and ERS-related proteins, including ATF6, CHOP, GRP78, ERP72, H6PD and calreticulin, whilst PERK and its target eIF2 were not affected, and IRE1 and ATF4 were downregulated. ABZ treatment in E. multilocularis infected mice reversed the increased ATF6 and calreticulin protein expression, tended to reverse increased CHOP, GRP78, ERP72 and H6PD expression, and decreased ATF4 and IRE1 expression to levels seen in mock-infected mice. The expression of miR-146a-5p (downregulated by IRE1) and miR-1839-5p (exhibiting a unique target site in the IRE1 3UTR) were significantly increased in E. multilocularis infected mice, an effect reversed by ABZ treatment. Other miRs analyzed were not altered in E. multilocularis infected mice.\n\nConclusions and SignificanceAE causes UPR activation and ERS in mice. The E. multilocularis-induced ERS was ameliorated by ABZ treatment, indicating its effectiveness to inhibit parasite proliferation and downregulate its activity status. ABZ itself did not affect UPR in control mice. Identified miR-146a-5p and miR-1839-5p might represent biomarkers of E. multilocularis infection. Modulation of UPR and ERS, in addition to ABZ administration, could be exploited to treat E. multilocularis infection.\n\nAuthor summaryAlveolar echinococcosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. Treatment of this fatal disease is limited to surgical intervention, preferably radical curative surgery if possible, and the use of parasitostatic benzimidazoles. It is not yet fully understood how the parasite can remain in the hosts tissue for prolonged periods, complicating the development of therapeutic applications. This work investigated an involvement of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum-stress (ERS) during E. multilocularis infection and upon treatment with albendazole (ABZ) in mice. The results revealed increased expression levels of the ERS sensor ATF6 and of downstream target genes in liver tissue of E. multilocularis- compared to mock-infected mice. Additionally, H6PD, generating NADPH within the endoplasmic reticulum, and the lectin-chaperone calreticulin were increased in E. multilocularis infected liver tissue while the expression of the ERS associated genes ATF4 and IRE1 were decreased. The miR-1839-5p and miR-146-p, linked to IRE1, were elevated upon E. multilocularis infection, offering potential as novel biomarkers of alveolar echinococcosis. The observed gene expression changes were at least partially reversed by ABZ treatment. Whether modulation of UPR and ERS targets can improve the therapy of alveolar echinococcosis remains to be investigated.",

    "abstract": "BackgroudThis study aimed to measure the knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 among Chinese dental students during the global outbreak recently.\n\nMethodA descriptive cross-sectional study was performed among dental students and nonmedical college students in China. All the participants were required to anonymously answer a reliable online questionnaire, which covered 3 different fields of COVID-19. Average scores of dental students (D group), including junior (JD group) and senior dental students (SD group), and nonmedical college students (N group) were compared respectively. Chi-square test and independent sample T test were taken for statistical analysis with SPSS.12.\n\nResultsTotally 497 questionnaires were collected, including 224 from dental students and 273 from non-medical students. The overall average score was 57{+/-}19.2. The average scores of dental students were 64.5{+/-}18. The D group had significantly higher scores on the total score, section scores, and 20 questions respectively than with the N group. No significant differences were found on 5 questions. Compared with the N group, the SD group won on all three sections while JD group failed to win on the diagnose section.\n\nConclusionAlthough the dental student showed good awareness regarding the clinical aspects of COVID-19 than non-medical students, there are still some weakness in the part of treatment and prevention, which need to be strengthened for better prepare during work. Besides, the low accuracy rate of lower grade dental students is also worth noting.",
