    "abstract": "Scientific exploration of phototrophic bacteria over nearly 200 years has revealed large phylogenetic gaps between known phototrophic groups that limit understanding of how phototrophy evolved and diversified. Through Boreal Shield lake water incubations, we cultivated an anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium from a previously unknown order within the Chloroflexota phylum that represents a highly novel transition form in the evolution of photosynthesis. Unlike all other known phototrophs, this bacterium uses a Type I reaction center (RCI) for light energy conversion yet belongs to the same bacterial phylum as organisms that use a Type II reaction center (RCII) for phototrophy. Using physiological, phylogenomic, and environmental metatranscriptomic data, we demonstrate active RCI-utilizing metabolism by the strain alongside usage of chlorosomes and bacteriochlorophylls related to those of RCII-utilizing Chloroflexota members. Despite using different reaction centers, our phylogenomic data provide strong evidence that RCI- and RCII-utilizing Chloroflexia members inherited phototrophy from a most recent common phototrophic ancestor that used RCI, RCII, or both reaction center classes, substantially revising our view of the diversity and evolution of phototrophic life. The Chloroflexota phylum preserves an evolutionary record of interaction between RCI and RCII among anoxygenic phototrophs that gives new context for exploring the origins of phototrophy on Earth.",

    "abstract": "Most psychophysiological studies of working memory (WM) target only the short-term memory construct, while short-term memory is only a part of the WM responsible for the storage of sensory information. Here, we aimed to further investigate oscillatory brain mechanisms supporting the executive components of WM - the part responsible for the manipulation of information. We conducted an exploratory reanalysis of a previously published EEG dataset where 156 participants (82 females) performed tasks requiring either simple retention or retention and manipulation of verbal information in WM. A relatively long delay period (>6s) was employed to investigate the temporal trajectory of the oscillatory brain activity. Compared to baseline, theta activity was significantly enhanced during encoding and the delay period. Alpha-band power decreased during encoding and switched to an increase in the first part of the delay before returning to the baseline in the second part; beta-band power remained below baseline during encoding and the delay. The difference between the manipulation and retention tasks in spectral power had diverse temporal trajectories in different frequency bands. The difference maintained over encoding and the first part of the delay in theta, during the first part of the delay in beta, and during the whole delay period in alpha. Our results suggest that task-related modulations in theta power co-vary with the demands on the executive control network; beta suppression during mental manipulation can be related to the activation of motor networks; alpha is likely to reflect the activation of language areas simultaneously with sensory input blockade.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, seemingly conflicting results were obtained regarding the question of whether features of an object are stored separately, or bound together, in visual working memory. Many of these studies are based on an implicit assumption about a default, or fixed, mode of working memory storage. In contrast, here we asked whether the anticipated memory probes used in a given experiment might determine the format in which information is maintained in working memory, consistent with its task-oriented function. In order to test this flexible maintenance hypothesis, we recorded EEG while subjects performed a delayed-match-to-sample task with different requirements and load. In Experiment 1, by contrasting conditions with and without the requirement of maintaining bound features, we found significant differences in EEG signals recorded in central-parietal channels while controlling for differences in visual stimulation. Such difference was confirmed by multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). Moreover, behavior results, topographical distributions and cross-contrast MVPA decoding jointly suggested that this effect is not the same as task load effect. These results were confirmed in Experiment 2 with an independent group of subjects with the same paradigm, providing reliable evidence that the format of object maintenance in visual working memory could be flexibly shaped by the current task.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial keratitis (BK) is a major cause of corneal blindness globally. This study aimed to develop a novel class of antimicrobial therapy, based on human-derived hybrid host defense peptides (HyHDPs), for treating BK. HyHDPs were rationally designed through combination of functional amino acids in parent HDPs, including LL-37 and human beta-defensin (HBD)-1 to -3. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and time-kill kinetics assay were performed to determine the concentration- and time-dependent antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity was evaluated against human corneal epithelial cells and erythrocytes. In vivo safety and efficacy of the most promising peptide was examined in the corneal wound healing and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC SA29213) keratitis murine models, respectively. A second-generation HyHDP (CaD23), based on rational hybridization of the middle residues of LL-37 and C-terminal of HBD-2, was developed and was shown to demonstrate good efficacy against methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MIC=12.5-25.0g/ml (5.2-10.4M)] and S. epidermidis [MIC=12.5g/ml (5.2M)], and moderate efficacy against P. aeruginosa [MIC=25-50g/ml (10.4-20.8M)]. CaD23 (at 25g/ml or 2x MIC) killed all the bacteria within 30 mins, which was 8 times faster than amikacin (25g/ml or 20x MIC). After 10 consecutive passages, CaD23 did not develop any antimicrobial resistance (AMR) whereas amikacin, a commonly used treatment for BK, developed significant AMR (i.e. a 32-fold increase in MIC). Pre-clinical murine studies showed that CaD23 (0.5mg/ml) achieved a median reduction of S. aureus bioburden by 94% (or 1.2 log10 CFU/ml) while not impeding corneal epithelial wound healing. In conclusion, rational hybridization of human-derived HDPs has led to generation of a potentially efficacious and safe topical antimicrobial agent for treating Gram-positive BK, with no/minimal risk of developing AMR.",

In an approach to inhibit the pathological signalling of pAkt by prolyl-hydroxylase-2 (PHD2) we employed -ketoglutarate (KG), a cofactor of PHD2. Octyl-KG supplementation to platelets promoted PHD2 activity through elevated intracellular KG:succinate ratio and reduced aggregation in vitro by suppressing pAkt1(Thr308). Augmented PHD2 activity was confirmed by increased hydroxylated-proline alongside enhanced binding of PHD2 to pAkt in KG-treated platelets. Contrastingly, inhibitors of PHD2 significantly increased pAkt1 in platelets. Octyl-KG followed similar mechanism in monocytes to inhibit cytokine secretion in vitro. Our data also describe a suppressed pAkt1 and reduced activation of platelet and leukocyte obtained from mice supplemented with dietary-KG, unaccompanied by alteration in their counts. Dietary-KG significantly reduced clot formation and leukocyte accumulation in various organs including lung of mice treated with thrombosis-inducing agent carrageenan. Importantly, we observed a significant rescue effect of dietary-KG on inflamed lung of SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters. KG significantly reduced leukocyte accumulation, clot formation and viral load alongside downmodulation of pAkt in lung of the infected animals. Therefore, our study suggests a safe implementation of dietary-KG in prevention of Akt-driven anomalies including thrombosis and inflammation, highlighting a better pulmonary management in COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Quantification of the magnitude of trait covariation plays a pivotal role in the study of phenotypic evolution, for which statistics based on dispersion of eigenvalues of a covariance or correlation matrix--eigenvalue dispersion indices--are commonly used. This study remedies major issues over the use of these statistics, namely, a lack of clear understandings on their statistical justifications and sampling properties. The relative eigenvalue variance of a covariance matrix is known in the statistical literature a test statistic for sphericity, thus is an appropriate measure of eccentricity of variation. The same of a correlation matrix is equal to the average squared correlation, which has a straightforward interpretation as a measure of integration. Expressions for the mean and variance of these statistics are analytically derived under multivariate normality, clarifying the effects of sample size N, number of variables p, and parameters on sampling bias and error. Simulations confirmed that approximations involved are reasonably accurate with a moderate sample size (N [&ge;] 16-64). Importantly, sampling properties of these indices are not adversely affected by a high p:N ratio, promising their utility in high-dimensional phenotypic analyses. They can furthermore be applied to shape variables and phylogenetically structured data with appropriate modifications.",

    "abstract": "Autophagosomes are double-membrane intracellular vesicles that degrade protein aggregates, intracellular organelles, and other cellular components. During the development of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, many somatic and germ cells undergo apoptosis. These cells are engulfed and degraded by their neighboring cells. We discovered a novel role of autophagosomes in facilitating the degradation of apoptotic cells using a real-time imaging technique. Specifically, the double-membrane autophagosomes in engulfing cells are recruited to the surfaces of phagosomes containing apoptotic cells and subsequently fuse to phagosomes, allowing the inner vesicle to enter the phagosomal lumen. Mutants defective in the production of autophagosomes display significant defects in the degradation of apoptotic cells, demonstrating the importance of autophagosomes to this process. The signaling pathway led by the phagocytic receptor CED-1, the adaptor protein CED-6, and the large GTPase dynamin (DYN-1) promotes the recruitment of autophagosomes to phagosomes. Moreover, the subsequent fusion of autophagosomes with phagosomes requires the functions of the small GTPase RAB-7 and the HOPS complex components. Further observations suggest that autophagosomes provide apoptotic cell-degradation activities in addition to and in parallel of lysosomes. Our findings reveal that, unlike the single-membrane, LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) vesicles reported for mammalian phagocytes, the canonical double-membrane autophagosomes facilitate the clearance of C. elegans apoptotic cells. These findings add autophagosomes to the collection of intracellular organelles that contribute to phagosome maturation, identify novel crosstalk between the autophagy and phagosome maturation pathways, and discover the upstream signaling molecules that initiate this crosstalk.",

With only our open channel polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) device, pipettes, and commercially available carrier fluid, we produce hundreds of microliter droplets; tubing, electronics, or pumps are not required, making droplet technology feasible for research labs without external flow generators. Furthermore, we demonstrated conceptual applications that showcase the process of droplet generation, splitting, transport, incubation, mixing, and sorting in our system. Unlike conventional droplet microfluidics, the open nature of the device enables the use of physical tools such as tweezers and styli to directly access the system; with this, we developed a new method of droplet sorting and transfer that capitalizes on the Cheerios effect, the aggregation of buoyant objects along a liquid interface. Our platform offers enhanced usability, direct access to the droplet contents, easy manufacturability, compact footprint, and high customizability. This design is a first step in exploring the space of power-free open droplet microfluidic systems and provide design rules for similar channel designs.",

    "abstract": "Even in the absence of external stimuli, neural activity is both highly dynamic and organized across multiple spatiotemporal scales. The continuous evolution of brain activity patterns during rest is believed to help maintain a rich repertoire of possible functional configurations that relate to typical and atypical cognitive phenomena. Whether these transitions or \"explorations\" follow some underlying arrangement or instead lack a predictable ordered plan remains to be determined. Here, using a precision dynamics approach, we aimed at revealing the rules that govern transitions in brain activity at rest at the single participant level. We hypothesized that by revealing and characterizing the overall landscape of whole brain configurations (or states) we could interpret the rules (if any) that govern transitions in brain activity at rest. To generate the landscape of whole-brain configurations we used Topological Data Analysis based Mapper approach. Across all participants, we consistently observed a rich topographic landscape in which the transition of activity from one state to the next involved a central hub-like \"transition state.\" The hub topography was characterized as a shared attractor-like basin where all canonical resting-state networks were represented equally. The surrounding periphery of the landscape had distinct network configurations. The intermediate transition state and traversal through it via a topographic gradient seemed to provide the underlying structure for the continuous evolution of brain activity patterns at rest. In addition, differences in the landscape architecture were more consistent within than between subjects, providing evidence of idiosyncratic dynamics and potential utility in precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "In a competitive game involving an animal and an opponent, the outcome is contingent on the choices of both players. To succeed, the animal must continually adapt to competitive pressure, or else risk being exploited and lose out on rewards. In this study, we demonstrate that head-fixed mice can be trained to play the iterative competitive game  matching pennies against a virtual computer opponent. We find that the animals performance is well described by a hybrid computational model that includes Q-learning and choice kernels. Comparing between matching pennies and a non-competitive two-armed bandit task, we show that the tasks encourage animals to operate at different regimes of reinforcement learning. To understand the involvement of neuromodulatory mechanisms, we measure fluctuations in pupil size and use multiple linear regression to relate the trial-by-trial transient pupil responses to decision-related variables. The analysis reveals that pupil responses are modulated by observable variables, including choice and outcome, as well as latent variables for value updating, but not action selection. Collectively, these results establish a paradigm for studying competitive decision-making in head-fixed mice and provide insights into the role of arousal-linked neuromodulation in the decision process.",

    "abstract": "The deep-branching eukaryote Giardia lamblia is an extracellular parasite that attaches to the host intestine via a microtubule-based structure called the ventral disc. Control of attachment is mediated in part by the movement of two regions of the ventral disc that either permit or exclude the passage of fluid under the disc. Several known disc-associated proteins (DAPs) contribute to disc structure and function, but no force-generating protein has been identified among them. We recently identified several Giardia actin (GlActin) interacting proteins at the ventral disc, which could potentially employ actin polymerization for force generation and disc conformational changes. One of these proteins, Disc and Actin Associated Protein 1 (DAAP1), is highly enriched at the two regions of the disc previously shown to be important for fluid flow during attachment. In this study, we investigate the role of both GlActin and DAAP1 in ventral disc morphology and function. We confirmed interaction between GlActin and DAAP1 through coimmunoprecipitation, and used immunofluorescence to localize both proteins throughout the cell cycle and during trophozoite attachment. Similar to other DAPs, the association of DAAP1 with the disc is stable, except during cell division when the disc disassembles. Depletion of GlActin by translation-blocking antisense morpholinos resulted in both impaired attachment and defects in the ventral disc, indicating that GlActin contributes to disc-mediated attachment. Depletion of DAAP1 through CRISPR interference resulted in intact discs but impaired attachment, gating, and flow under the disc. As attachment is essential for infection, elucidation of these and other molecular mediators is a promising area for development of new therapeutics against a ubiquitous parasite.\n\nAuthor SummaryGiardia lamblia is a single-celled organism and one of the most common gastrointestinal parasites worldwide. In developing countries, recurrent Giardia infections are common, due to lack of access to clean water. Giardia infections can lead to diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, disruption of the intestinal microbiome, and chronic infections can lead to irritable bowel syndrome. Because existing drug treatments have side effects and Giardias resistance to drugs is increasing, new treatment strategies are needed. The parasites attachment to the hosts intestine is mediated by a Giardia-specific structure that resembles a suction cup and is called the ventral adhesive disc. We previously identified DAAP1, a protein which interacts with Giardia actin and localizes to the ventral disc. Here, we explore the relationship between these two proteins and investigate their role in disc-based attachment. Most disc proteins, including DAAP1, are unrelated to any human proteins, making them appealing drug targets to inhibit parasite attachment and infection.",

The present study examined activity in putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons across cortical layers of A1 in awake male and female mice during auditory, visual, and audiovisual stimulation. We observed a subpopulation of A1 neurons responsive to visual stimuli alone, which were overwhelmingly found in the deep cortical layers and included both excitatory and inhibitory cells. Other neurons for which responses to sound were modulated by visual context were similarly excitatory or inhibitory but were less concentrated within the deepest cortical layers. Important distinctions in visual context sensitivity were observed among different spike rate and timing responses to sound. Spike rate responses were themselves heterogeneous, with stronger responses evoked by sound alone at stimulus onset, but greater sensitivity to visual context by sustained firing activity following transient onset responses. Minimal overlap was observed between units with visual-modulated firing rate responses and spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) which are sensitive to both spike rate and timing changes. Together, our results suggest visual information in A1 is predominantly carried by deep layer inputs and influences sound encoding across cortical layers, and that these influences independently impact qualitatively distinct responses to sound.\n\nSignificance statementMultisensory integration is ubiquitous throughout the brain, including primary sensory cortices. The present study examined visual responses in primary auditory cortex, which were found in both putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons and concentrated in the deep cortical layers. Visual-modulated responses to sound were similarly observed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons but were more evenly distributed throughout cortical layers. Visual modulation moreover differed substantially across distinct sound response types. Transient stimulus onset spike rate changes were far less sensitive to visual context than sustained spike rate changes during the remainder of the stimulus. Spike timing changes were often modulated independently of spike rate changes. Audiovisual integration in auditory cortex is thus diversely expressed among cell types, cortical layers, and response types.",

    "abstract": "Microglia, the brains resident macrophages, shape neural development and wiring, and are key neuroimmune hubs in the pathological signature of neurodevelopmental disorders. In the human brain, microglial development has not been carefully examined yet, and most of our knowledge derives from rodents. We established an unprecedented collection of 97 postmortem tissues enabling quantitative, sex-matched, detailed analysis of microglial across the human lifespan. We identify the dynamics of these cells in the human telencephalon, describing novel waves in microglial density across gestation and infancy, controlled by a balance of proliferation and apoptosis, which track key neurodevelopmental milestones. These profound changes in microglia are also observed in bulk RNAseq and single-cell RNAseq datasets. This study provides unparalleled insight and detail into the spatiotemporal dynamics of microglia across the human lifespan. Our findings serve as a solid foundation for elucidating how microglia contribute to shaping neurodevelopment in humans.",

    "abstract": "Motor neurons (MNs) control muscle movement and are essential for breathing, walking and fine motor skills. Motor Neuron and Pancreas Homeobox 1 (MNX1) has long been recognized as a key marker of the MN lineage. Deficiency of the Mnx1 gene in mice results in early postnatal lethality - likely by causing abnormal MN development and respiratory malfunction. However, the genome-wide targets and exact regulatory function of Mnx1 in MNs remains unresolved. Using an in vitro model for efficient MN induction from mouse embryonic stem cells, we identified about six thousand MNX1-bound loci, of which half are conserved enhancers co-bound by the core MN-inducing factors ISL1 and LHX3, while the other half are promoters for housekeeping-like genes. Despite its widespread binding, disruption of Mnx1 affects the activity of only a few dozen MNX1-bound loci, and causes mis-regulation of about one hundred genes, the majority of which are up-regulated pan-neuronal genes with relatively higher expression in the brain compared to MNs. Integration of genome-wide binding, transcriptomic and epigenomic data in the wild-type and Mnx1-disrupted MNs predicts that Pbx3 and Pou6f2 are two putative direct targets of MNX1, and both are homeobox transcription factors highly expressed in the central nervous system. Our results suggest that MNX1 is crucial for restraining the expression of many pan-neuronal genes in MNs, likely in an indirect fashion. Further, the rarity of direct targets in contrast to the widespread binding of MNX1 reflects a distinctive mode of transcriptional regulation by homeobox transcriptional factors.",
