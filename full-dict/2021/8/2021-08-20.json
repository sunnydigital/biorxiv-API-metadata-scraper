    "abstract": "The misfolding of proteins and their aggregation in the form of fibrils or amyloid-like spherulites are involved in a spectrum of pathological abnormalities. Our current understanding of protein amyloid aggregation mechanisms has primarily relied on the use of spectrometric methods to determine the average growth rates and diffraction limited microscopes with low temporal resolution to observe the large-scale morphologies of intermediates. We developed a REal-time kinetics via binding and Photobleaching LOcalisation Microscopy (REPLOM) super-resolution method to directly observe and quantify the existence and abundance of diverse aggregate morphologies below the diffraction limit and extract their heterogeneous growth kinetics. Our results revealed that even the growth of a microscopically identical aggregates, e.g. amyloid spherulites, may follow distinct pathways. Specifically, spherulites do not exclusively grow isotropically but, surprisingly, may also grow anisotropically, following similar pathways as reported for minerals and polymers. Combining our technique with machine learning approaches, we associated growth rates to specific morphological transitions and provided energy barriers and the energy landscape at the level of single aggregate morphology. Our unifying framework for the detection and analysis of spherulite growth can be extended to other self-assembled systems characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity, disentangling the broad spectrum of diverse morphologies at the single-molecule level.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has a broad mammalian species tropism infecting humans, cats, dogs and farmed mink. Since the start of the 2019 pandemic several reverse zoonotic outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 have occurred in mink, one of which reinfected humans and caused a cluster of infections in Denmark. Here we investigate the molecular basis of mink and ferret adaptation and demonstrate the spike mutations Y453F, F486L, and N501T all specifically adapt SARS-CoV-2 to use mustelid ACE2. Furthermore, we risk assess these mutations and conclude mink-adapted viruses are unlikely to pose an increased threat to humans, as Y453F attenuates the virus replication in human cells and all 3 mink-adaptations have minimal antigenic impact. Finally, we show that certain SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging from circulation in humans may naturally have a greater propensity to infect mustelid hosts and therefore these species should continue to be surveyed for reverse zoonotic infections.",

It has been demonstrated that, besides the major canonical transcripts, the viral genome also codes for non-canonical RNA molecules. While the structural characterizations have revealed a detailed transcriptomic architecture of the virus, the kinetic studies provided poor and often misleading results on the dynamics of both the viral and host transcripts due to the low temporal resolution of the infection event and the low virus/cell ratio (MOI=0.1) applied for the infection. In this study, we used direct cDNA and direct RNA nanopore sequencings for the generation of high-coverage, high-temporal-resolution transcriptomic datasets on SARS-CoV-2 and on primate host cells infected with a high virus titer (MOI=5). Sixteen sampling time points ranging from 1 to 96h with a varying time resolution and three biological replicates were used in the experiment for both the infected and the non-infected cells.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) provokes a hypercoagulable state with increased incidence of thromboembolism and mortality. Platelets are major effectors of thrombosis and hemostasis. Suitable animal models are needed to better understand COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) and underlying platelet phenotypes. Here, we assessed K18-hACE2 mice undergoing a standardized SARS-CoV-2 infection protocol to study dynamic platelet responses via mass spectrometry-based proteomics. In total, we found significant changes in >1,200 proteins. Strikingly, protein alterations occurred rapidly by 2 days post-infection (dpi) and preceded outward clinical signs of severe disease. Pathway enrichment analysis of 2dpi platelet proteomes revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulated complement-coagulation networks (F2, F12, CFH, CD55/CD59), platelet activation-adhesion-degranulation proteins (PF4, SELP, PECAM1, HRG, PLG, vWF), and chemokines (CCL8, CXCL5, CXCL12). When mice started to lose weight at 4dpi, pattern recognition receptor signaling (RIG-I/MDA5, CASP8, MAPK3), and interferon pathways (IFIT1/IFIT3, STAT1) were predominant. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the lungs was observed by immunohistochemistry, but in platelets was undetected by proteomics. Similar to patients, K18-hACE2 mice during SARS-CoV-2 infection developed progressive lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia with platelet aggregates in the lungs and kidneys. In conclusion, this model recapitulates activation of coagulation, complement, and interferon responses in circulating platelets, providing valuable insight into platelet pathology during COVID-19.\n\nKey PointsO_LISARS-CoV-2-infected humanized ACE2 mice recapitulate platelet reprogramming towards activation-degranulation-aggregation.\nC_LIO_LIComplement/coagulation pathways are dominant in platelets at 2 days post-infection (dpi), while interferon signaling is dominant at 4dpi.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Recent research demonstrates that Australia lags in providing open access to research outputs. In Australia, while the two major research funding bodies require open access of outputs from projects they fund, these bodies only fund a small proportion of research conducted. The major source of research and experimental development funding in Australian higher education is general university, or institutional, funding, and such funds are not subject to national funder open access policies. Thus, institutional policies and other institutional supports for open access are important in understanding Australias OA position. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to understand the characteristics of Australian institutional open access policies and to explore the extent they represent a coherent and unified approach to delivering and promoting open access in Australia. Open access policies were located using a systematic web search approach and then their contents were analysed. Only half of Australian universities were found to have an open access policy. There was a wide variation in language used, expressed intent of the policy and expectations of researchers. Few policies mention monitoring or compliance and only three mention consequences for non-compliance. While it is understandable that institutions develop their own policies, when language is used which does not reflect national and international understandings, when requirements are not clear and with consequences, policies are unlikely to contribute to understanding of open access, to uptake of the policy, or to ease of transferring understanding and practices between institutions. A more unified approach to open access is recommended.",

    "abstract": "The effector proteins expressed by plant pathogens are one of the essential components of the host-pathogen interaction. Despite being important, most of the effector proteins remain unexplored due to the lack of conserved features and huge diversity in their primary sequence. In the present study, extensive secretome analysis was performed in sixteen major plant fungal pathogens to find the conserved features in the candidate secretory effector proteins (CSEPs) using homology and ab initio modeling approaches. Interestingly, a variable number of plant kiwellin proteins fold like secretory proteins were found in all the major rust fungal pathogens. Many of them are predicted as potential effector proteins. For instance, 26 out of 35 Kiwellin like proteins identified in Puccinia striiformis race 104E 137A were predicted as potential effector proteins. In addition, a kiwellin predicted effector gene, Pst_13960, from the Indian Puccinia striiformis race Yr9 was characterized using overexpression, localization, and deletion studies in Nicotiana benthamiana. The Pst_13960 suppressed the BAX-induced cell death and localized in the chloroplast. Furthermore, the expression of the kiwellin matching region (Pst_13960_kiwi) alone suppressed the BAX-induced cell death in N. benthamiana despite the change of location to the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting the novel function of the kiwellin fold in rust fungi. Further analysis of these proteins predicted these candidates to contain N-terminal Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) putatively associated with chloroplast translocation as deletion of region abolished the chloroplast localization of Pstr_13960. Overall, the current study reports the presence of kiwellin like proteins in rust fungi that act as a novel effector in plants.\n\nAuthor SummaryRust fungi are one of the most devastating plants infecting pathogens. These pathogens secrete several distinct proteins like effector proteins that help the pathogens in the establishment of infection by suppressing cell death induced by the plants. Despite being important, these effector proteins remain unexplored due to the lack of conserved features. Currently, different methods are being used to characterize them however, could not describe their specific function fully due to a lack of knowledge of the functional domain. Recent advancement in effector protein tertiary structure characterization using NMR (Nuclear magnetic resonance) and X-ray crystallography has been very helpful in identifying the conserved structural features defining functionality. However, these techniques are quite complicated and may take a lot of time and labor. On the other hand, the computational approaches for structural prediction of the effectors may help to identify known folds or domains with few efforts but at a significant level. Therefore, such computational approaches can be efficiently implemented in the preliminary screening of the candidates. In the present study using the computational structure prediction method, we were able to find several conserved novel kiwellin folds containing effectors, in different rust fungi. We characterized one of the candidates and it showed interference with artificially induced cell death in plants. This study highlights the novel function of the kiwellin like effector proteins of the rust fungi that are already identified to play a role in host defense against plant pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic bacteria rely on protein phosphorylation to adapt quickly to stress, including that imposed by the host during infection. Penicillin-binding protein and serine/threonine- associated (PASTA) kinases are signal transduction systems that sense cell wall integrity and modulate multiple facets of bacterial physiology in response to cell envelope stress. The PASTA kinase in the cytosolic pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, PrkA, is required for cell wall stress responses, cytosolic survival, and virulence, yet its substrates and downstream signaling pathways remain incompletely defined. We combined orthogonal phosphoproteomic and genetic analyses in the presence of a {beta}-lactam antibiotic to define PrkA phosphotargets and pathways modulated by PrkA. These analyses synergistically highlighted ReoM, which was recently identified as a PrkA target that influences peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis, as an important phosphosubstrate during cell wall stress. We find that deletion of reoM restores cell wall stress sensitivities and cytosolic survival defects of a {Delta}prkA mutant to nearly wild-type levels. While a {Delta}prkA mutant is defective for PG synthesis during cell wall stress, a double {Delta}reoM {Delta}prkA mutant synthesizes PG at rates similar to wild type. In a mouse model of systemic listeriosis, deletion of reoM in a {Delta}prkA background almost fully restored virulence to wild-type levels. However, loss of reoM alone also resulted in attenuated virulence, suggesting ReoM is critical at some points during pathogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate that the PASTA kinase/ReoM cell wall stress response pathway is conserved in a related pathogen, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Taken together, our phosphoproteomic analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the PASTA kinase targets of an important model pathogen and suggests that a critical role of PrkA in vivo is modulating PG synthesis through regulation of ReoM to facilitate cytosolic survival and virulence.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMany antibiotics target bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, justifying continued study of this process and the ways bacteria respond to cell wall insults, especially in the context of infection. Penicillin-binding protein and serine/threonine-associated (PASTA) kinases are master regulators of cell wall stress responses in bacteria and are conserved in several major pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We previously showed that the PASTA kinase in L. monocytogenes, PrkA, is essential for the response to cell wall stress and virulence. PrkA is also necessary for adaptation to the cytosol, which L. monocytogenes requires during its infectious lifecycle. In this work, we combined orthogonal phosphoproteomic and genetic screens to identify PrkA substrates in L. monocytogenes. We show that phosphoregulation of one candidate from both screens, ReoM, increases peptidoglycan synthesis and that this regulation is required for cytosolic survival and virulence. We also demonstrate that the PASTA kinase-ReoM pathway regulates cell wall stress responses in another significant pathogen, methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Additionally, we uncover a PrkA-independent role for ReoM in vivo in L. monocytogenes, suggesting a need for nuanced modulation of peptidoglycan synthesis during infection. Cumulatively, this study provides new insight into how bacterial pathogens control cell wall synthesis during infection.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, drastically modifies infected cells in an effort to optimize virus replication. Included is the activation of the host p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which plays a major role in inflammation and is a central driver of COVID-19 clinical presentations. Inhibition of p38/MAPK activity in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells reduces both cytokine production and viral replication. Here, we combined genetic screening with quantitative phosphoproteomics to better understand interactions between the p38/MAPK pathway and SARS-CoV-2. We found that several components of the p38/MAPK pathway impacted SARS-CoV-2 replication and that p38{beta} is a critical host factor for virus replication, and it prevents activation of the type-I interferon pathway. Quantitative phosphoproteomics uncovered several SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphorylation sites near the N-terminus that were sensitive to p38 inhibition. Similar to p38{beta} depletion, mutation of these nucleocapsid residues was associated with reduced virus replication and increased activation of type-I interferon signaling. Taken together, this study reveals a unique proviral function for p38{beta} that is not shared with p38 and supports exploring p38{beta} inhibitor development as a strategy towards developing a new class of COVID-19 therapies.\n\nImportanceSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed millions of lives since its emergence in 2019. SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells requires the activity of several cellular pathways for successful replication. One such pathway, the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, is required for virus replication and disease pathogenesis. Here, we applied systems biology approaches to understand how MAPK pathways benefit SARS-CoV-2 replication to inform the development of novel COVID-19 drug therapies.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical regulators of diverse developmental and physiological processes, and they themselves get regulated both at the level of biogenesis and turnover. We demonstrate that the ribonuclease XRN2 can degrade the mature forms of certain let-7 family members in multiple human cancer cell lines, without affecting their precursors. XRN2 also affects the accumulation of several other tumor suppressor miRNAs known to play important roles in cancer metabolism. XRN2 depletion results in a reduction in the expression of many oncogenes and diminishes the proliferative and metastatic potential of cancer cells in vitro. These experimental cancer cells also show reduced capacity to form tumors in mice and regress over time. The clinical relevance of these observations is further verified in tumour transcriptomics data from public RNA-sequencing datasets, where XRN2 mRNA expression is inversely correlated with the levels of a large number of miRNAs, including let-7 members, and high XRN2 mRNA levels are associated with poor survival in hepatocellular carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and glioblastoma. We demonstrate that the miRNA is released by an as-yet unidentified proteinaceous  miRNA release factor from the grasp of Argonaute before its degradation, which is more abundant in the nuclear fraction. Our analyses of the patient-derived transcriptomics data also show that XRN2, via its regulation of let-7, affects multiple pathways in a consistent manner across epithelial and glial cell lineages, and thus, is of critical pathophysiological significance.",

Using an additional anti-Fab nanobody further facillitated reliable initial 3D structure determination from small cryo-EM test datasets.

    "abstract": "Essential functions of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) depend on their capacity to selectively phosphorylate a limited repertoire of substrates. MAPKs harbor a conserved groove located outside of the catalytic cleft that binds to short linear sequence motifs found in substrates and regulators. However, the weak and transient nature of these \"docking\" interactions poses a challenge to defining MAPK interactomes and associated sequence motifs. Here, we describe a yeast-based genetic screening pipeline to evaluate large collections of MAPK docking sequences in parallel. Using this platform we analyzed a combinatorial library based on the docking sequences from the MAPK kinases MKK6 and MKK7, defining features critical for binding to the stress-activated MAPKs JNK1 and p38. We subsequently screened a library consisting of ~12,000 sequences from the human proteome, revealing a large number of MAPK-selective interactors, including many not conforming to previously defined docking motifs. Analysis of p38/JNK1 exchange mutants identified specific docking groove residues mediating selective binding. Finally, we verified that docking sequences identified in the screen could function in substrate recruitment in vitro and in cultured cells. Collectively, these studies establish an approach for characterization of MAPK docking sequences and provide a resource for future investigation of signaling downstream of p38 and JNK MAP kinases.",

    "abstract": "The protein TRIM5 has multiple roles in anti-retroviral defense, but the mechanisms underlying TRIM5 action are unclear. Here, we used an APEX2-based proteomics approach to identify TRIM5-interacting proteins. Analysis of the TRIM5 interactome found proteins participating in a wide variety of cellular functions including regulating antiviral signaling pathways. We used this data set to uncover a novel role for TRIM5 in mitophagy, an autophagy-based mode of mitochondrial quality control that is compromised in multiple human diseases. Mitochondrial damage triggered the relocalization of TRIM5 to ER-mitochondria contact sites where TRIM5 colocalized with markers of autophagy initiation and autophagosome biogenesis. Furthermore, we found that TRIM5 knockout attenuated both Parkin-dependent and Parkin-independent mitophagy by preventing the recruitment of autophagy regulators FIP200 and ATG13 to unhealthy mitochondria. Finally, TRIM5 knockout cells showed reduced mitochondrial function under basal conditions and were more susceptible to uncontrolled immune activation and cell death in response to mitochondrial damage than were wild type cells. Taken together, our studies have identified a homeostatic role for a protein previously recognized exclusively for its antiviral actions.",

    "abstract": "Vps54 is an integral subunit of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which is involved in tethering endosome-derived vesicles to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). A destabilizing missense mutation in Vps54 causes the age-progressive motor neuron (MN) degeneration, muscle weakness, and muscle atrophy observed in the wobbler mouse, an established animal model for human MN disease. It is currently unclear how the disruption of Vps54, and thereby the GARP complex, leads to MN and muscle phenotypes. To develop a new tool to address this question, we have created an analogous model in Drosophila by generating novel loss-of-function alleles of the fly Vps54 ortholog (scattered/scat). We find that null scat mutant adults are viable but have a significantly shortened lifespan. Like phenotypes observed in the wobbler mouse, we show that scat mutant adults are male sterile and have significantly reduced body size and muscle area. Moreover, we demonstrate that scat mutant adults have significant age-progressive defects in locomotor function. Interestingly, we see sexually dimorphic effects, with scat mutant adult females exhibiting significantly stronger phenotypes. Finally, we show that scat interacts genetically with rab11 in MNs to control age-progressive muscle atrophy in adults. Together, these data suggest that scat mutant flies share mutant phenotypes with the wobbler mouse and may serve as a new genetic model system to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying MN disease.",

    "abstract": "The A-genome diploid wheats represent the earliest domesticated and cultivated wheat species in the Fertile Crescent and the donor of the wheat A sub-genome. The A-genome species encompass the cultivated einkorn (Triticum. monococcum L. subsp. monococcum), wild einkorn (T. monococcum L. subsp. aegilopoides (Link) Thell.) and T. urartu. We evaluated the collection of 930 accessions in the Wheat Genetics Resource Center (WGRC), using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and identified 13,089 curated SNPs. Genomic analysis detected misclassified and duplicated accessions with most duplicates originated from the same or a nearby locations. About 56% (n = 520) of the WGRC A-genome species collections were duplicates supporting the need for genomic characterization for effective curation and maintenance of these collections. Population structure analysis confirmed the morphology-based classifications of the accessions and reflected the species geographic distributions. We also showed that the T. urartu as the closest A-genome diploid to wheat through phylogenetic analysis. Population analysis within the wild einkorn group showed three genetically distinct clusters, which corresponded with wild einkorn races , {beta}, and {gamma} described previously. The T. monococcum genome-wide FST scan identified candidate genomic regions harboring domestication selection signature (Btr1) on the short arm of chromosome 3Am at ~ 70 Mb. We established A-genome core set (79 accessions) based on allelic diversity, geographical distribution, and available phenotypic data. The individual species core set maintained at least 80% of allelic variants in the A-genome collection and constitute a valuable genetic resource to improve wheat and domesticated einkorn in breeding programs.\n\nOne-sentence summaryGenotyping of gene bank collections of diploid A-genome relatives of wheat uncovered relatively higher genetic diversity and unique evolutionary relationships which gives insight to the effective use of these germplasm for wheat improvement.",

    "abstract": "Replication stress and abundant repetitive sequences have emerged as primary conditions underlying genomic instability in eukaryotes. Elucidating the mechanism of recombination between repeated sequences in the context of replication stress is essential to understanding how genome rearrangements occur. To gain insight into this process, we used a prokaryotic Tus/Ter barrier designed to induce transient replication fork stalling near inverted repeats in the budding yeast genome. Remarkably, we show that the replication fork block stimulates a unique recombination pathway dependent on Rad51 strand invasion and Rad52-Rad59 strand annealing activities, as well as Mph1/Rad5 fork remodelers, Mre11/Exo1 short and long-range resection machineries, Rad1-Rad10 nuclease and DNA polymerase {delta}. Furthermore, we show recombination at stalled replication forks is limited by the Srs2 helicase and Mus81-Mms4/Yen1 structure-selective nucleases. Physical analysis of replication-associated recombinants revealed that half are associated with an inversion of sequence between the repeats. Based on our extensive genetic characterization, we propose a model for recombination of closely linked repeats at stalled replication forks that can actively contribute to genomic rearrangements.",

    "abstract": "DNA-wrapped single walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) conjugates have remarkable optical properties leading to their use in biosensing and imaging applications. A critical limitation in the development of DNA-SWNT sensors is the current inability to predict unique DNA sequences that confer a strong analyte-specific optical response to these sensors. Here, near-infrared (nIR) fluorescence response datasets for ~100 DNA-SWNT conjugates, narrowed down by a selective evolution protocol starting from a pool of ~1010 unique DNA-SWNT candidates, are used to train machine learning (ML) models to predict new unique DNA sequences with strong optical response to neurotransmitter serotonin. First, classifier models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) are trained on sequence features to classify DNA ligands as either high response or low response to serotonin. Second, support vector machine (SVM) regression models are trained to predict relative optical response values for DNA sequences. Finally, we demonstrate with validation experiments that integrating the predictions of ensembles of the highest quality CNN classifiers and SVM regression models leads to the best predictions of both high and low response sequences. With our ML approaches, we discovered five new DNA-SWNT sensors with higher fluorescence intensity response to serotonin than obtained previously. Overall, the explored ML approaches introduce an important new tool to predict useful DNA sequences, which can be used for discovery of new DNA-based sensors and nanobiotechnologies.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/457145v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9e1a2corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c84e68org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1939d1eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@30424e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Development of efficient lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vectors remains a major challenge towards broad clinical translation of RNA therapeutics. New lipids will be required, but also better understanding LNP interactions with the biological environment. Herein, we model protein corona formation on PEG-ylated DLin-MC3-DMA LNPs and identify time-dependent maturation steps that critically unlock their cellular uptake and mRNA delivery. Uptake requires active serum proteins and precedes after a significant ([~]2 hours) lag-time, which we show can be eliminated by pre-incubating LNPs for 3-4 hours in serum-containing media. This indicates an important role of protein corona maturation for the pharmacokinetic effects of these LNPs. We show, using single-nanoparticle imaging, NMR diffusometry, SANS, and proteomics, that the LNPs, upon serum exposure, undergo rapid PEG-shedding ([~]30 minutes), followed by a slower rearrangement of the adsorbed protein layer. The PEG-shedding coincides in time with high surface abundance of Apolipoprotein A-II, whereas the LNPs preferentially bind Apolipoprotein E when their maximum uptake-competent state is reached. Finally, we show that pre-incubation of the LNPs enables rapid uptake and allows pulse-chase video-microscopy colocalization experiments with sufficiently short pulse durations to gain improved mechanistic understanding of how intracellular trafficking events determine delivery efficacy, emphasizing early endosomes as important delivery-mediating compartments.",

    "abstract": "Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a rare premature aging disease caused by a single-point mutation in the lamin A gene, resulting in a truncated and farnesylated form of lamin A. This mutant lamin A protein, known as progerin, accumulates at the periphery of the nuclear lamina, resulting in both an abnormal nuclear morphology and nuclear stiffening. HGPS patients experience rapid onset of atherosclerosis, with death from heart attack or stroke as teenagers. Progerin expression has been shown to cause dysfunction in both vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells (ECs). In this study we examined how progerin-expressing ECs adapt to fluid shear stress, the principal mechanical force from blood flow. We compared the response to shear stress for progerin-expressing, wild-type lamin A overexpressing, and control ECs to physiological levels of fluid shear stress. Additionally, we also knocked down ZMPSTE24 in ECs, which results in increased farnesylation of lamin A and similar phenotypes to HGPS. Our results showed that ECs either expressing progerin or with ZMPSTE24 knockdown were unable to adapt to shear stress, experiencing significant cell loss at a longer duration of exposure to shear stress (3 days). ECs overexpressing wild-type lamin A also exhibited similar impairments in adaptation to shear stress, including similar levels of cell loss. Quantification of nuclear morphology showed that progerin-expressing ECs had similar nuclear abnormalities in both static and shear conditions. Treatment of progerin-expressing cells and ZMPSTE24 KD cells with lonafarnib and methystat, drugs previously shown to improve HGPS nuclear morphology, resulted in improvements in adaptation to shear stress. Additionally, pre-alignment of cells to shear stress prior to progerin-expression prevented cell loss. Our results demonstrate that changes in nuclear lamins can affect the ability of EC to properly adapt to shear stress.",

    "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous set of diseases that has, until recently, lacked any FDA-approved, molecularly targeted therapeutics. Thus, systemic chemotherapy regimens remain the standard of care for many. Unfortunately, even combination chemotherapy is ineffective for many TNBC patients, and side-effects can be severe or lethal. Identification of predictive biomarkers for chemotherapy response would allow for the prospective selection of responsive patients, thereby maximizing efficacy and minimizing unwanted toxicities. Here, we leverage a cohort of TNBC PDX models with responses to single-agent docetaxel or carboplatin to identify biomarkers predictive for differential response to these two drugs. To demonstrate their ability to function as a preclinical cohort, PDX were molecularly characterized using whole-exome DNA sequencing, RNAseq transcriptomics, and mass spectrometry-based total proteomics to show proteogenomic consistency with TCGA and CPTAC clinical samples. Focusing first on the transcriptome, we describe a network-based computational approach to identify candidate epithelial and stromal biomarkers of response to carboplatin (MSI1, TMSB15A, ARHGDIB, GGT1, SV2A, SEC14L2, SERPINI1, ADAMTS20, DGKQ) and docetaxel (ITGA7, MAGED4, CERS1, ST8SIA2, KIF24, PARPBP). Biomarker panels are predictive in PDX expression datasets (RNAseq and Affymetrix) for both taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel) and platinum-based (carboplatin or cisplatin) response, thereby demonstrating both cross expression platform and cross drug class robustness. Biomarker panels were also predictive in clinical datasets with response to cisplatin or paclitaxel, thus demonstrating translational potential of PDX-based preclinical trials. This network-based approach is highly adaptable and can be used to evaluate biomarkers of response to other agents.",

    "abstract": "Root Hairs (RHs) growth is highly influenced by endogenous as well as by external environmental signals that coordinately regulate its final cell size. RHs actively expand the root surface responsible for nutrient uptake and water absorption. We have recently determined that RH growth was unexpectedly boosted when Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings are cultivated at low temperatures. It was proposed that RH growth plasticity in response to low temperature was linked to a reduced nutrient availability in the media. Here, we explored the molecular basis of this strong RH growth response by using the Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) approach on Arabidopsis thaliana natural accessions. We identified the poorly characterized PEROXIDASE 62 (PRX62) as a key protein triggering this conditional growth under a moderate low-temperature stress. In addition, we identified the related protein PRX69 as an important factor in this developmental process. The prx62 prx69 double mutant and the PRX62 and PRX69 over-expressing lines showed contrasting RH phenotypes, peroxidase activities and cyt/apoReactive Oxygen Species (ROS) levels. Strikingly, a cell wall protein extensin (EXT) reporter revealed the effect of peroxidase activity on the EXT cell wall association at 10{degrees}C in the RH apical zone. EXT cell wall insolubilization was enhanced at 10{degrees}C, which was completely abolished under the PRX inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) treatment. Finally, we demonstrated that the Root Hair defective 6-like 4 (RSL4) bHLH family transcription factor directly controls the expression of PRX69. Collectively, our results indicate that both PRX62 and PRX69 are key apoplastic PRXs that modulate ROS-homeostasis and cell wall EXT-insolubilization linked to RH elongation at low-temperature.",

    "abstract": "Acylsugars are a class of plant defense compounds produced across many distantly related families. Members of the horticulturally important morning glory (Convolvulaceae) family produce a diverse sub-class of acylsugars called resin glycosides (RGs), which comprise oligosaccharide cores, hydroxyacyl chain(s), and decorating aliphatic and aromatic acyl chains. While many RG structures are characterized, the extent of structural diversity of this class in different genera and species is not known. In this study, we asked whether there has been lineage-specific diversification of RG structures in different Convolvulaceae species that may suggest diversification of the underlying biosynthetic pathways. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed from root and leaf extracts of 26 species sampled in a phylogeny-guided manner. LC-MS/MS revealed thousands of peaks with signature RG fragmentation patterns with one species producing over 300 signals, mirroring the diversity in Solanaceae-type acylsugars. A novel RG from Dichondra argentea was characterized using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy, supporting previous observations of RGs with open hydroxyacyl chains instead of closed macrolactone ring structures. Substantial lineage-specific differentiation in utilization of sugars, hydroxyacyl chains, and decorating acyl chains was discovered, especially among Ipomoea and Convolvulus - the two largest genera in Convolvulaceae. Adopting a computational, knowledge-based strategy, we further developed a high-recall workflow that successfully explained ~72% of the MS/MS fragments, predicted the structural components of 11/13 previously characterized RGs, and partially annotated ~45% of the RGs. Overall, this study improves our understanding of phytochemical diversity and lays a foundation for characterizing the evolutionary mechanisms underlying RG diversification.",

Here we describe an active learning module developed to teach protein structure fundamentals while supporting ongoing research in enzyme discovery.

Pre-activity lectures introduced fundamentals of protein secondary structure and provided context for the research projects, while a homework assignment familiarized students with 3D visualization of biomolecules using UCSF Chimera, a free protein structure viewer. The activity is an online survey in which students compare structure elements in papain, a well-characterized cysteine protease from Carica papaya, to novel homologous proteases identified from the genomes of an extremophilic microbe (Halanaerobium praevalens) and two carnivorous plants (Drosera capensis and Cephalotus follicularis). Students were then able to identify, with varying levels of accuracy, a number of structural features in cysteine proteases that could expedite the identification of novel or biochemically interesting cysteine proteases for experimental validation in a university laboratory. Student responses to a post-activity survey were largely positive and constructive, describing points in the activity that could be improved and indicating that the activity helped them learn about protein structure.",

    "abstract": "Motor systems must continuously adapt their output to maintain a desired trajectory. While the spinal circuits underlying rhythmic locomotion are well described, little is known about how the network modulates its output strength. A major challenge has been the difficulty of recording from spinal neurons during behavior. Here, we use voltage imaging to map the membrane potential of glutamatergic neurons throughout the spinal cord of the larval zebrafish during fictive swimming in a virtual environment. We mapped the spiking, subthreshold dynamics, relative timing, and sub-cellular electrical propagation across large populations of simultaneously recorded cells. We validated the approach by confirming properties of known sub-types, and we characterized a yet undescribed sub-population of tonic-spiking ventral V3 neurons whose spike rate correlated with swimming strength and bout length. Optogenetic activation of V3 neurons led to stronger swimming and longer bouts but did not affect tail-beat frequency. Genetic ablation of V3 neurons led to reduced locomotor adaptation. The power of voltage imaging allowed us to identify V3 neurons as a critical driver of locomotor adaptation in zebrafish.",

It is unclear how the loss of SACS causes these deficits, or why they manifest as cerebellar ataxia. We employed a multi-omics approach to characterize molecular and cellular deficiencies in SACS knockout (KO) cells. We identified alterations in microtubule structure and dynamics, protein trafficking, and mislocalization of synaptic and focal adhesion proteins. Targeting PTEN, a negative regulator of focal adhesions, rescued several cellular phenotypes in SACS KO cells. We found sacsin interacts with proteins implicated in vesicle transport, including HSP proteins, and interactions between structural and cell adhesion proteins were diminished in SACS KO cells.

    "abstract": "Tropical forest restoration stands to deliver important conservation gains, particularly in lowland Southeast Asia, which has suffered some of the worlds highest rates of forest loss and degradation. This promise, however, depends on the extent to which biodiversity at forest restoration sites continues to be exposed to threats. A key knowledge gap concerns the extent to which biodiversity recovery in naturally regenerating tropical forests is impacted by trapping for the multi-million-dollar wildlife trade. Here, we use a repeated survey dataset to quantify rates of avian community recovery under forest regeneration, at a flagship restoration site in the lowland rainforests of Sumatra, Indonesia. We show that over a decade, forest regeneration was associated with significant abundance increases for 43.8% of bird species.\n\nHowever, the apparent negative impacts of trade-driven trapping on avian populations also intensified: the proportion of species that show increased abundance only in very remote forests increased from 5.4% to 16.2%, while the overall accessibility of the forest increased. We found that 14% of species did not recover as fast as predicted based on the observed improvement in forest conditions over the study period. Our results highlight the potential for rapid avifaunal recovery in regenerating tropical forests, but also emphasize the urgency of tackling the serious threat of wildlife trade to Southeast Asias biodiversity.",

Here we solved the crystal structure of a complete bacterial glycyl tRNA synthetase (bacGlyRS) and show that indeed, bacGlyRS carries several structural signals that point it at the origin of all aaRSs. Furthermore, if bacGlyRS is ancestral, it should help to build a reliable Tree of Life (ToL). Given the modular nature of protein evolution, we used only two sub-domain segments with duplicated ancestral topologies, no detected orthologs and an assumed limited horizontal gene transfer (HGT). These motifs correspond to the non-specific RNA binding regions of contemporary bacGlyRS, archaeal CCA-adding enzyme (arch-CCAadd), and eukaryotic rRNA processing enzyme (euk-rRNA).

    "abstract": "Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are agents of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, but can also be vertically inherited by daughter cells. Establishing the dynamics that led to contemporary patterns of MGEs in bacterial genomes is central to predicting the emergence and evolution of novel and resistant pathogens. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clonal-complex (CC) 398 is the dominant MRSA in European livestock and a growing cause of human infections. Previous studies have identified three categories of MGEs whose presence or absence distinguishes livestock-associated CC398 from a closely related and less antibiotic-resistant human-associated population. Here we fully characterise the evolutionary dynamics of these MGEs using a collection of 1,180 CC398 genomes, sampled from livestock and humans, over 27 years. We find that the emergence of livestock-associated CC398 coincided with the acquisition of a Tn916 transposon carrying a tetracycline resistance gene, which has been stably inherited for 57 years. This was followed by the acquisition of a type V SCCmec that carries methicillin, tetracycline and heavy metal resistance genes, which has been maintained for 35 years, with occasional truncations and replacements with type IV SCCmec. In contrast, a class of prophages that carry a human immune evasion gene cluster and that are largely absent from livestock-associated CC398, have been repeatedly gained and lost in both human- and livestock-associated CC398. These contrasting dynamics mean that when livestock-associated MRSA is transmitted to humans, adaptation to the human host outpaces loss of antibiotic resistance. In addition, the stable inheritance of resistance-associated MGEs suggests that the impact of ongoing reductions in antibiotic and zinc oxide use in European farms on livestock-associated MRSA will be slow to be realised.",

    "abstract": "Clock proteins maintain constant enzymatic activity regardless of temperature, even though thermal fluctuation is accelerated as temperature increases. We investigated temperature influences on the dynamics of KaiC, a temperature-compensated ATPase in the cyanobacterial circadian clock system, using quasielastic neutron scattering. The frequency of picosecond to sub-nanosecond incoherent local motions in KaiC was accelerated very slightly in a temperature-dependent manner. Our mutation studies revealed that internal motions of KaiC include several contributions of opposing temperature sensitivities. To take advantage of this balancing effect, the motional frequency of local dynamics in KaiC needs to exceed [~]0.3 ps-1. Some of the mutation sites may be in a pathway through which the motional frequency in the C-terminal domain of KaiC is fed back to the active site of ATPase in its N-terminal domain. The temperature-compensating ability at the dynamics level is likely crucial for circadian clock systems, into which the clock proteins are incorporated, to achieve reaction- or even system-level temperature compensation of the oscillation frequency.",

However, it could potentially play a role in potentiating anti-tumor immunity in the immunologically \"cold\" metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) by inducing antigen presentation pathways and concurrently providing targets for immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Moreover, it could additionally increase sensitivity to chemotherapy based on its pleiotropic effects on cell phenotype. Here, we show that IFN{gamma} treatment induced expression of major histocompatibility class-I (MHC-I) genes and PD-L1 in prostate cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, IFN{gamma} treatment led to a decrease in E-cadherin expression with a consequent increase in sensitivity to chemotherapy in vitro. In an in vivo murine tumor model of spontaneous metastatic prostate cancer, IFN{gamma} systemic pretreatment upregulated the expression of HLA-A and decreased E-cadherin expression in the primary tumor, and more importantly in the metastatic site led to increased apoptosis and limited micrometastases in combination with paclitaxel treatment compared to diffuse metastatic disease in control and monotherapy treatment groups. These findings suggest that IFN{gamma} may be useful in combinatorial regimens to induce sensitivity to immunotherapy and chemotherapy in hepatic metastases of mCRPC.",

To determine whether and how such a large in-frame BRAF deletion might be activating, we ectopically expressed it in HEK293 cells and monitored BRAF pathway activation and response to BRAF and MEK inhibitors.

To understand the molecular mechanisms controlling the DLK function, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening analysis and identified FKBPL as a DLK-binding protein that bound to the kinase domain and inhibited the kinase enzymatic activity of DLK. FKBPL regulated DLK stability through ubiquitin-dependent DLK degradation. We tested other members in the FKBP protein family and found that FKBP8 also induced DLK degradation as FKBPL did. We found that Lysine 271 residue in the kinase domain of DLK was a major site of ubiquitination and SUMO3-conjugation and responsible for FKBP8-mediated degradation. In vivo overexpression of FKBP8 delayed progression of axon degeneration and neuronal death following axotomy in sciatic and optic nerves, respectively, although axon regeneration efficiency was not enhanced. This research identified FKBPL and FKBP8 as new DLK-interacting proteins that regulated DLK stability by MG-132 or bafilomycin A1-sensitive protein degradation.",

    "abstract": "We recently identified a nuclear-encoded miRNA (miR-181c) in cardiomyocytes that can translocate into mitochondria to regulate mitochondrial gene (mt-COX1), and influence obesity-induced cardiac dysfunction through mitochondrial pathway. Liver plays a pivotal role during obesity. Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-181c plays an important role in pathophysiological complications associated with obesity. We used miR-181c/d-/- mice to study the miR-181c role in lipogenesis in hepatocytes during diet-induced obesity (DIO). Indirect calorimetric measurements were made during the 26 weeks high fat diet (HFD) exposure. qPCR was performed to examine the gene expression involved in lipid synthesis. Here, we show that miR-181c/d-/- mice are not protected against all metabolic consequences of HFD exposure. After 26 weeks of the HFD, miR-181c/d-/- mice had a significantly higher body fat (%) compared to WT. Glucose tolerance tests showed hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, indicative of insulin insensitivity in the miR-181c/d-/- mice. HFD-fed miR-181c/d-/- mice had higher serum and liver triglyceride levels compared to HFD-fed WT mice. qPCR data demonstrated that several genes which are regulated by isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) were upregulated in miR-181c/d-/- liver compared to WT liver. Furthermore, an AAV-8 was used to deliver miR-181c, in vivo, to validate the potential role of miR-181c in the liver. miR-181c delivery attenuate the lipogenesis by downregulating the same lipid synthesis genes in the liver. In hepatocytes, miR-181c regulates lipid biosynthesis by targeting IDH1. Taken together, the data indicate that overexpression of miR-181c can be beneficial for various lipid metabolism disorders.",

    "abstract": "Neural stem cells (NSCs) quiescence plays pivotal roles in securing sustainable neurogenesis and avoiding stemness exhaustion in the adult brain. The maintenance of quiescence and transition between proliferation and quiescence are complex processes associated with multiple niche signals, and environmental stimuli. Though the mechanisms of the transitions between NSC states have been extensively investigated, they remain to be fully elucidated. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) containing functional units such as proteins, microRNAs, and mRNAs. It has already been demonstrated that sEVs actively participate in cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. However, the role of sEVs in NSC quiescence has not been investigated. Here, we applied proteomics to analyze the protein cargos of sEVs derived from proliferating, quiescent, and reactivating NSCs. Our findings revealed expression level fluctuations of NSCs sEV protein cargo at different proliferative conditions. We also identified functional clusters of gene ontology annotations from differentially expressed proteins in three sources of exosomes. Moreover, the use of exosome inhibitors revealed the contribution of exosomes to NSC quiescence at the entrance into quiescence, as well as in quiescence maintenance. Exosome inhibition delayed the entrance into quiescence by proliferating NSCs and allowed quiescent NSCs to exit from the G0 phase of the cell cycle. Protein translation was significantly upregulated in both quiescent NSCs and quiescent-induced NSCs via the exosome inhibition. Our results demonstrated that NSC exosomes are involved in regulating the quiescence of NSCs and provide a functional prediction of NSCs exosome protein cargos in terms of cell-cycle regulation and protein synthesis.",

The MTT assay result showed that our extract has less cytotoxicity on normal cell (PCS-291-010, IC50 = 6,680.00 g/ml) compared to the colon cancer cell lines and has more effect on metastatic cancer cell line (SW-620, IC50 = 5,492.31 g /ml) than non-metastatic cancer cell line (HT-29, IC50 =6,040.76 g/ml). According to the DNA fragmentation pattern analysis, the ladder pattern indicated that the rice bran extract can induce the apoptosis process in SW-620 cell line. Confirmed the pattern of apoptotic cell by AO/PI double stain test and quantified apoptotic cells by Annexin V. For the cell senescence analysis, SA-{beta}-gal staining technique was performed at 24 h after treatments, HT-29 reached maximum senescence rate at 85.74% while SW-620 had only 17.23% of senescence. And a result of cell cycle analysis, HT-29 were decreased the number of cells in S, M/G2 phase, and increased the number of cells in G0/G1 phase. Furthermore > 50 kDa peptide fraction separated from HRBE has a potent anti-cancer cells (SW-620, IC50 = 4,908 g/ml). In conclusion, the hydrolyzed riceberry rice bran extract can inhibit colon cancer cell lines with less effect on normal cell. The extracts could induce apoptosis process in metastatic cancer cell and induce senescence process in non-metastatic cancer cell. This observed information will be useful and applicable for medical research and colon cancer treatment in the future.",
