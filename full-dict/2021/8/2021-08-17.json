    "abstract": "Usutu virus (USUV) and West Nile virus (WNV) are phylogenetically close emerging arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes, and constitute a global public health threat. Since USUV and WNV enter the body through the skin, the first immune cells they encounter are skin-resident dendritic cells, the most peripheral outpost of immune defense. This unique network is composed of Langerhans cells (LCs) and dermal DCs, which reside in the epidermis and the dermis, respectively.\n\nUsing human skin explants, we show that while both viruses can replicate in keratinocytes, they can also infect resident DCs with distinct tropism, since WNV preferentially infects DCs in the dermis, whereas USUV has a greater propensity to infect LCs. Using both purified human epidermal LCs (eLCs) and monocyte derived LCs (MoLCs), we confirm that LCs sustain a faster and more efficient replication of USUV compared with WNV and that this correlates with a more intense innate immune response to USUV compared with WNV. Next, we show that ectopic expression of the LC-specific C-type lectin receptor (CLR), langerin, in HEK293T cells allows WNV and USUV to bind and enter, but supports the subsequent replication of USUV only. Conversely, blocking or silencing langerin in MoLCs or eLCs made them resistant to USUV infection, thus demonstrating that USUV uses langerin to enter and replicate in LCs. Altogether, our results demonstrate that LCs constitute privileged target cells for USUV in human skin, because langerin favors its entry and replication. Intriguingly, this suggests that USUV efficiently escapes the antiviral functions of langerin, which normally safeguards LCs from most viral infections.",

    "abstract": "Viral structural proteins can have multiple activities. Antivirals that target structural proteins have potential to exhibit multiple antiviral mechanisms. Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) core protein (Cp) is involved in most stages of the viral lifecycle: it assembles into capsids, packages viral RNA, is a metabolic compartment for reverse transcription, interacts with nuclear trafficking machinery, and disassembles to release the viral genome into the nucleus. During nuclear localization, HBV capsids bind to host importins (e.g. Imp{beta}) via Cps C-terminal domain (CTD); the CTD is localized to the interior of the capsid and is transiently exposed on the exterior. We used HAP12 as a representative Cp Allosteric Modulators (CpAMs), a class of antivirals that inappropriately stimulates and misdirects HBV assembly and deforms capsids. CpAM impact on other aspects of the HBV lifecycle is poorly understood. We investigated how HAP12 influenced the interactions between empty or RNA-filled capsids with Imp{beta} and trypsin in vitro. We showed that HAP12 can modulate CTD accessibility and capsid stability, depending on the saturation of HAP12-binding sites. We demonstrated that Imp{beta} synergistically contributes to capsid disruption at high levels of HAP12 saturation, using electron microscopy to visualize disruption and rearrangement of Cp dimers into aberrant complexes. However, RNA-filled capsids resisted the destabilizing effects of HAP12 and Imp{beta}. In summary, we show host protein-induced catalysis of capsid disruption, an unexpected additional mechanism of action for CpAMs. Potentially, untimely capsid disassembly can hamper the HBV lifecycle and also cause the virus to become vulnerable to host innate immune responses.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe HBV core, an icosahedral complex of 120 copies of the homodimeric core (capsid) protein with or without packaged nucleic acid, is transported to the host nucleus by its interaction with host importin proteins. Importin-core interaction requires the core protein C-terminal domain, which is inside the capsid, to \"flip\" to the capsid exterior. Core-protein directed drugs that affect capsid assembly and stability have been developed recently. We show that these molecules can, synergistically with importins, disrupt capsids. This mechanism of action, synergism with host protein, has potential to disrupt the virus lifecycle and activate the innate immune system.",

    "abstract": "Gene activation by mammalian transcription factors (TFs) requires dynamic, multivalent, and selective interactions of their intrinsically disordered low-complexity domains (LCDs), but how such interactions mediate transcription remains unclear. It has been proposed that extensive LCD-LCD interactions culminating in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of TFs is the dominant mechanism underlying transactivation. Here, we investigated how tuning the amount and localization of LCD-LCD interactions in vivo affects transcription of endogenous human genes. Quantitative single-cell and single-molecule imaging reveals that the oncogenic TF EWS/FLI1 requires a finely tuned range of LCD-LCD interactions to efficiently activate target genes. Modest or more dramatic increases in LCD-LCD interactions toward putative LLPS repress EWS/FLI1-driven transcription in patient cells. Likewise, ectopically creating LCD-LCD interactions to sequester EWS/FLI1 into a bona fide LLPS compartment, the nucleolus, inhibits EWS/FLI1-driven transcription and oncogenic transformation. Our findings reveal fundamental principles underlying LCD-mediated transcription and suggest mislocalizing specific LCD-LCD interactions as a novel therapeutic strategy for targeting disease-causing TFs.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that undergo fission and fusion, enabling swift structural modification to adapt cellular needs. Disturbances in mitochondrial dynamics, frequently defects ascribed to neurons, have been associated with pathological contexts such as neurodegeneration in Parkinsons disease. Nonetheless, the mechanism of glial mitochondrial dynamics contributing to neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here we present evidence that the Drosophila R-SNARE VAMP7 regulates glial mitochondrial dynamics and dopaminergic neuron survival via modulating the dynamic of mitochondria-lysosome contact, which determines the mitochondrial fission site. Independent of its characterized role in autophagosome-lysosome fusion, glial VAMP7 depletion causes mitochondrial elongation and dysfunction, increased ROS levels, and production of lipid droplets. These conferred changes in glia in turn affects nearby dopaminergic neuron survival. Glial VAMP7 genetically interacts with the mitochondrial fission/fusion factors Drp1 and Marf1 and controls glial mitochondrial dynamics via regulating the frequency and duration of mitochondria-lysosome contact. Our findings indicate that SNARE proteins, although not direct mediators on mitochondrial fusion, provide spatial cues to modulate glial mitochondrial fission via organelle contacts, impacting on neuron survival in a non-cell-autonomous manner.",

    "abstract": "Senescence is an irreversible proliferation withdrawal that can be initiated after DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest in G2 phase to prevent genomic instability. Senescence onset in G2 is not well understood; it requires p53 and RB family tumour suppressors, but how they are regulated to convert a temporary cell cycle arrest into a permanent one remains unknown. Here, we show that a previously unrecognised balance between the CDK inhibitor p21 and Chk1 controls D-type cyclin-CDK activity during G2 arrest. In non-transformed cells, p21 activates RB in G2 by inhibiting Cyclin D1-CDK2/CDK4. The resulting G2 exit, which precedes appearance of senescence markers, is associated with a mitotic bypass, Chk1 inhibition and DNA damage foci reduction. In p53/RB-proficient cancer cells, compromised G2 exit correlates with sustained Chk1 activity, delayed p21 induction, untimely Cyclin E1 re-expression and genome reduplication. Chk1 depletion promotes cell cycle exit by inducing p21 binding to Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1-CDK complexes and down-regulating CDK6, whereas Chk2 knockdown promotes RB phosphorylation and delays G2 exit. In conclusion, p21 and Chk2 oppose Chk1 to maintain RB activity, thus controlling DNA damage-induced senescence onset in G2.",

Ultimately, we created a map of the INSR protein and indicated which parts of the protein structure had significant effects on type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. We concluded differences in the charged/polar amino acids on the lower right section of the structure(amino acid numbers 487 and 750) were associated with pathogenic variants, while charged/polar differences on the lower left of the structure(amino acid numbers 669 and 784) had no impact on pathogenicity.

    "abstract": "Translating ribosomes unwind mRNA secondary structures by three basepairs each elongation cycle. Despite the ribosome helicase, certain mRNA stem-loops stimulate programmed ribosomal frameshift by inhibiting translation elongation. Here, using mutagenesis, biochemical and single-molecule experiments, we examine whether high stability of three basepairs, which are unwound by the translating ribosome, is critical for inducing ribosome pauses. We find that encountering frameshift-inducing mRNA stem-loops from the E. coli dnaX mRNA and the gag-pol transcript of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) hinders A-site tRNA binding and slows down ribosome translocation by 15-20 folds. By contrast, unwinding of first three basepairs adjacent to the mRNA entry channel slows down the translating ribosome by only 2-3 folds. Rather than high thermodynamic stability, specific length and structure enable regulatory mRNA stem-loops to stall translation by forming inhibitory interactions with the ribosome. Our data provide the basis for rationalizing transcriptome-wide studies of translation and searching for novel regulatory mRNA stem-loops.",

    "abstract": "Obstacle crossing is a typical adaptive locomotion known to be related to the risk of falls. Previous conventional studies have used elaborate and costly optical motion capture systems, which not only represent a considerable expense but also require participants to visit a laboratory. To overcome these shortcomings, we aimed to develop a practical and inexpensive solution for measuring obstacle-crossing behavior by using the Microsoft Azure Kinect, one of the most promising markerless motion capture systems. We validated the Azure Kinect as a tool to measure foot clearance and compared its performance to that of an optical motion capture system (Qualisys). We also determined the effect of the Kinect sensor placement on measurement performance. Sixteen healthy young men crossed obstacles of different heights (50, 150, and 250 mm). Kinect sensors were placed in front of and beside the obstacle as well as diagonally between those positions. As indices of measurement quality, we counted the number of measurement failures and calculated the systematic and random errors between the foot clearance measured by the Kinect and Qualisys. We also calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients between the Kinect and Qualisys measurements. The number of measurement failures and the systematic and random error were minimized when the Kinect was placed diagonally in front of the obstacle on the same side as the trail limb. The high correlation coefficient (r > 0.890) observed between the Kinect and Qualisys measurements suggests that the Azure Kinect has excellent potential for measuring foot clearance during obstacle-crossing tasks.",

    "abstract": "Rainfed crops rely on two sources of water: stored soil water at sowing and seasonal rain. In strongly seasonal winter-rainfall environments, stored soil water at sowing is minor, and uncertain seasonal rainfall is a source of risk. In south-eastern Australia, under-fertilisation is a common outcome of nitrogen risk management with implications for yield and soil mining. Here we explore the use of carbon isotope composition ({delta} 13C) to capture the effects of water in the prediction of yield and guide nitrogen management. In the sampled environment, crops receive at least 50% of seasonal rainfall by stem elongation, and at least 70% of seasonal rainfall by flowering. In a sample of 1518 plots, yield varied from 0.07 to 9.96 t ha-1 and correlated with {delta} 13C measured with isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) at flowering; this is consistent with the rainfall pattern and the physiology of the crop featuring a critical period for yield from 300 {degrees}Cd before to 100 {degrees}Cd after anthesis. In a sample of 135 plots, yield varied from 1.2 to 8.4 t ha-1 and correlated with {delta} 13C measured with IRMS at stem elongation. Yield response to nitrogen, defined as the difference between yield in fertilised crops (50 to 200 kg N ha-1) and unfertilised controls, correlated with {delta} 13C measured with IRMS at stem elongation, except for late-sown crops. Mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) returned estimates of {delta} 13C that agreed with {delta} 13C measured with IRMS (calibration: R2 = 0.82, RMSE = 0.53{per thousand}, n = 833; validation: R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.75{per thousand}, n = 364). We conclude that a MIR based, high-throughput, affordable measurement of {delta} 13C could be scaled to guide nitrogen management of wheat in winter-rainfall environments.",

Whilst EEG and MEG offer millisecond temporal resolution of how activity patterns emerge and evolve, standard decoding methods present significant barriers to interpretability as they obscure the underlying spatial and temporal activity patterns. We instead propose the use of a generative encoding model framework that simultaneously infers the multivariate spatial patterns of activity and the variable timing at which these patterns emerge on individual trials. An encoding model inversion allows predictions to be made about unseen test data in the same way as in standard decoding methodology. These SpatioTemporally Resolved MVPA (STRM) models can be flexibly applied to a wide variety of experimental paradigms, including classification and regression tasks. We show that these models provide insightful maps of the activity driving predictive accuracy metrics; demonstrate behaviourally meaningful variation in the timing of pattern emergence on individual trials; and achieve predictive accuracies that are either equivalent or surpass those achieved by more widely used methods. This provides a new avenue for investigating the brains representational dynamics and could ultimately support more flexible experimental designs in future.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIWe introduce SpatioTemporally Resolved MVPA (STRM), an approach that explicitly models how successive stages of stimulus processing are distributed in both space and time in M/EEG data.\nC_LIO_LIWe show that STRM is broadly applicable to diverse types of M/EEG data and outputs meaningful and interpretable maps of how neural representations evolve in space and time at millisecond resolution.\nC_LIO_LIThe trial-specific deviations in activity pattern timings identified by STRM are not random, but vary systematically with inter-trial differences in behavioural, cognitive and physiological variables.\nC_LIO_LIThese methods result in predictive accuracy metrics that are mostly equivalent to, or a modest improvement on, conventional methods.\nC_LI",

We find that the complexity of brain activity can be used as a correlate of consciousness. For two of the anaesthetics used, propofol and medetomidine, we find that the anaesthetised state is accompanied by a reduction in the complexity of brain activity. On the other hand we observe that use of ketamine produces an increase in complexity measurements.

    "abstract": "Visual cortex organization is highly consistent across individuals. But to what degree does this consistency depend on life experience, in particular sensory experience? In this study, we asked whether visual cortex reorganization in congenital blindness results in connectivity patterns that are particularly variable across individuals, focusing on resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns from primary visual cortex. We show that the absence of shared visual experience results in more-variable RSFC patterns across blind individuals than sighted controls. Increased variability is specifically found in areas that show a group difference between the blind and sighted in their RSFC. These findings reveal a relationship between brain plasticity and individual variability in which reorganization manifests variably across individuals. We further investigated the different patterns of reorganization in the blind, showing that the connectivity to frontal regions, proposed to have a role in reorganization of the visual cortex of the blind towards higher cognitive roles, is highly variable. In a supplementary analysis, we link some of the variability in visual-to-frontal connectivity to another environmental factor - duration of formal education. Together, these findings show a role of sensory and socioeconomic experience in imposing consistency on brain organization. By revealing the idiosyncratic nature of neural reorganization, these findings highlight the importance of considering individual differences in fitting sensory aids and restoration approaches for vision loss.\n\nSignificance statementThe typical visual system is highly consistent across individuals. What are the origins of this consistency? Comparing the consistency of visual cortex connectivity between people born blind and sighted people, we showed that blindness results in higher variability, suggesting a key impact of individual experience on brain organization. Further, connectivity patterns that changed following blindness were particularly variable, resulting in diverse patterns of brain reorganization. Individual differences in reorganization were also directly affected by non-visual experiences in the blind (years of formal education). Together, these findings show a role of sensory and socioeconomic experiences in creating individual differences in brain organization and endorse the use of individual profiles for rehabilitation and restoration of vision loss.",

    "abstract": "The spatial location of cerebrospinal fluid contacting (CSF-c) neurons enables important regulatory homeostatic functions regarding pH and motion control. Their intricate organization, facing the central canal and extending across the spinal cord, in relation to specific subtypes is poorly understood. This calls for imaging methods with a high spatial resolution (5-10 nm) to resolve the synaptic and ciliary compartments of each individual cell to elucidate their signalling pathways and enough throughput to dissect the cellular organization. Here, light-sheet and expansion microscopy resolved the persistent ventral and lateral organization of dopamine and somatostatin CSF-c neuronal types.\n\nThe number of somatostatin-containing dense core vesicles, resolved by STED microscopy, was shown to be markedly reduced upon each exposure to alkaline or acidic pH inhibiting any movement as part of a homeostatic response. Their cilia symmetry was unravelled by ExSTED as sensory in contrast with the motile one found in the dopaminergic ph insensitive neurons. This novel experimental workflow elucidates the functional role of CSF-c neuron subtypes in situ paving the way for further spatial and functional cell type classification.",

    "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is a sustainable carbon feedstock source for aerobic CH4-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) to produce value-added chemicals. Under substrate-limited (e.g., CH4, oxygen and nitrogen) conditions, CH4 oxidation results in the production of various short-chain organic acids and platform chemicals. These CH4-derived products could be broadened by utilizing them as a feedstock for heterotrophic bacteria. As a proof of concept, a two-stage system for CH4 abatement and 1-alkene production was developed in this study. Types I and II methanotrophs, i.e., Methylobacter tundripaludum SV96 and Methylocystis rosea SV97, respectively, were investigated in batch tests under different CH4 and air supplementation schemes. CH4 oxidation under either microaerobic or aerobic conditions induced the production of formate, acetate, succinate, and malate in M. tundripaludum SV96, accounting for 4.8-7.0% of consumed CH4-carbon while M. rosea SV97 produced the same compounds except for malate, and with lower efficiency than M. tundripaludum SV96, accounting for 0.7-1.8% of consumed CH4-carbon For the first time, the organic acids-rich spent media of methanotrophs were successfully used for 1-alkene production using engineered Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1  tesA-undA cells. The highest yield of 1-undecene was obtained from spent medium of M. tundripaludum SV96 at 68.9 {+/-} 11.6 mol mol Csubstrate-1.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), a major downstream effector molecule of mTORC1, regulates cell growth and proliferation by modulating protein translation and ribosome biogenesis. We have recently identified eIF4E as an intermediate in transducing signals from mTORC1 to S6K1 and further demonstrated that the role of mTORC1 is restricted to inducing eIF4E phosphorylation and interaction with S6K1. This interaction relieves S6K1 auto-inhibition and facilitates its hydrophobic motif (HM) phosphorylation and activation as a consequence. These observations underscore a possible involvement of mTORC1 independent kinase in mediating HM phosphorylation. Here, we report mTORC2 as an in-vivo/physiological HM kinase of S6K1. We show that rapamycin-resistant S6K1 truncation mutant {Delta}NH{Delta}CT continues to display HM phosphorylation with selective sensitivity toward Torin-1. We also show that HM phosphorylation of wildtype S6K1and {Delta}NH{Delta}CT depends on the presence of mTORC2 regulatory subunit-rictor. Furthermore, truncation mutagenesis and molecular docking analysis reveal the involvement of a conserved 19 amino acid stretch of S6K1 in mediating interaction with rictor. We finally show that deletion of the 19 amino acid region from wild type S6K1 results in loss of interaction with rictor, with a resultant loss of HM phosphorylation regardless of the presence of functional TOS motif. Our data demonstrate that mTORC2 acts as a physiological HM kinase that can activate S6K1 after its auto-inhibition is overcome by mTORC1. We, therefore, propose a novel mechanism for S6K1 regulation where mTOR complex 1 and 2 act in tandem to activate the enzyme.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundConserved non coding Sequences (CNSs) are extensively studied for their regulatory properties and functional importance to organisms. Many features such as location, proximity to the likely target gene, lineage specificity, functionality of likely target genes, and nucleotide composition of these sequences have been investigated, thus have provided very meaningful insight to signify underlying evolutionary importance of these elements. Also thorough investigation around how to assign function to non-coding regions of eukaryote genomes is another area that is studied. On one hand evolutionary analyses, including signatures of selection or conservation which can indicate the presence of constraint, suggesting that sequences that are evolving non-neutrally are candidates for functionality. On the other hand evidence that is based on experimental profiling of transcription, methylation, histone modifications and chromatin state. While these types of data are very important and are associated with function in most cases, this is not always the case. Evolutionary conservation though highly conservative which mostly considers elements identifiable in more than one species, is still being used as the initial guideline in investigating function via experiments. If we had an understanding of the experimental profiles of conserved non-coding regions as there may be patterns that are often associated these potentially functional elements it may help to construed functionality of conserved non coding regions easily.\n\nResultsIn an effort to try integrate experimental profile data, we investigated evidence of expression of conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs). For CNSs from ten primates, we assessed transcription, histone modifications, level of evolutionary constraint or accelerated evolution, and assessed possible target genes, tissue expression profiles of likely target genes (as some CNSs may be enhancers, and may be ncRNAs that interact directly with mRNA) and clustering patterns of CNSs. In total we found 153475 CNSs conserved across all ten primates. Of these 59,870 were overlapping non coding regions of ncRNA genes. H3K4Me1 marks (often associated with active enhancers) were highly correlated with CNSs whereas H4K20Me1 (linked to, e.g. DNA damage repair) had high correlation with conserved ncRNA regions (ncRNA-gene-CEs). Both CNSs and conserved ncRNA showed evidence of being under purifying selection. The CNSs in our dataset overall exhibited lower allele frequencies, consistent with higher levels of evolutionary constraint. We also found that CNSs and ncRNA-gene-CEs produce mutually exclusive groups. The analyses also suggest that both types of conserved elements have undergone waves of accelerated evolution, which we speculate may indicate changes in regulatory requirements following divergence events. Finally, we find that likely target genes for hominoidae, primate and mammalian-specific CNSs and ncRNA-gene-CEs are predominantly associated with brain-related function in humans.\n\nConclusionThe deep conserved primate CNSs and ncRNA gene-CEs signify functional importance suggesting ongoing recruitment of these elements into brain-related functions, consistent with King and Wilsons hypothesis that regulatory changes may account for rapid changes in phenotype among primates.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering the evolutionary relationships of Chelicerata (arachnids, horseshoe crabs, and allied taxa) has proven notoriously difficult, due to their ancient rapid radiation and the incidence of elevated evolutionary rates in several lineages. While conflicting hypotheses prevail in morphological and molecular datasets alike, the monophyly of Arachnida is nearly universally accepted. Though a small number of phylotranscriptomic analyses have recovered arachnid monophyly, these did not sample all living chelicerate orders. We generated a dataset of 506 high-quality genomes and transcriptomes, sampling all living orders of Chelicerata with high occupancy and rigorous approaches to orthology inference. Our analyses consistently recovered the nested placement of horseshoe crabs within a paraphyletic Arachnida. This result was insensitive to variation in evolutionary rates of genes, complexity of the substitution models, and alternatives algorithmic approaches to species tree inference. Investigation of systematic bias showed that genes and sites that recover arachnid monophyly are enriched in noise and exhibit low information content. To test the effect of morphological data, we generated a 514-taxon morphological data matrix of extant and fossil Chelicerata, analyzed in tandem with the molecular matrix. Combined analyses recovered the clade Merostomata (the marine orders Xiphosura, Eurypterida, and Chasmataspidida), but nested within Arachnida. Our results suggest that morphological convergence resulting from adaptations to life in terrestrial habitats has driven the historical perception of arachnid monophyly, paralleling the history of numerous other invertebrate terrestrial groups.",

    "abstract": "Prime editing is a highly versatile CRISPR-based genome editing technology with the potential to correct the vast majority of pathogenic mutations (1). However, correction of a disease phenotype in vivo in somatic tissues has not been demonstrated thus far. Here, we establish proof-of-concept for in vivo prime editing and repair the metabolic liver disease phenylketonuria (PKU) in mice. We first developed a size-reduced SpCas9 prime editor (PE) lacking the RNaseH domain of the reverse transcriptase (PE2{Delta}RnH), and a linker- and NLS-optimized intein-split PE construct (PE2 p.1153) for delivery by adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. Systemic dual AAV-mediated delivery of this variant into the liver of neonatal mice enabled installation of a transversion mutation at the Dnmt1 locus with an average efficiency of 15%, and delivery of unsplit PE2{Delta}RnH using human adenoviral vector 5 (AdV5) further increased editing rates to 58%. PE2{Delta}RnH-encoding AdV5 was also used to correct the disease-causing mutation of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (Pah)enu2 allele in phenylketonuria (PKU) mice with an average efficiency of 8% (up to 17.3%), leading to therapeutic reduction of blood phenylalanine (L-Phe) levels. Our study demonstrates in vivo prime editing in the liver with high precision and editing rates sufficient to treat a number of metabolic liver diseases, emphasizing the potential of prime editing for future therapeutic applications.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryIn vivo prime editing corrects phenylketonuria in mice.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila cell lines are used by researchers to investigate various cell biological phenomena. It is crucial to exercise good cell culture practice. Poor handling can lead to both inter- and intraspecies cross-contamination. Prolonged culturing can lead to introduction of large- and small-scale genomic changes. These factors, therefore, make it imperative that methods to authenticate Drosophila cell lines are developed to ensure reproducibility. Mammalian cell line authentication is reliant on short tandem repeat (STR) profiling, however the relatively low STR mutation rate in D. melanogaster at the individual level is likely to preclude the value of this technique. In contrast, transposable elements (TE) are highly polymorphic among individual flies and abundant in Drosophila cell lines. Therefore, we investigated the utility of TE insertions as markers to discriminate Drosophila cell lines derived from the same or different donor genotypes, divergent sub-lines of the same cell line, and from other insect cell lines. We developed a PCR-based next-generation sequencing protocol to cluster cell lines based on the genome-wide distribution of a limited number of diagnostic TE families. We determined the distribution of five TE families in S2R+, S2-DRSC, S2-DGRC, Kc167, ML-DmBG3-c2, mbn2, CME W1 Cl.8+, and OSS Drosophila cell lines. Two independent downstream analyses of the NGS data yielded similar clustering of these cell lines. Double-blind testing of the protocol reliably identified various Drosophila cell lines. In addition, our data indicate minimal changes with respect to the genome-wide distribution of these five TE families when cells are passaged for at least 50 times. The protocol developed can accurately identify and distinguish the numerous Drosophila cell lines available to the research community, thereby aiding reproducible Drosophila cell culture research.",

Cancer cells are constantly challenged by mechanical stresses not only in the primary tumour but also during metastasis. However, this latter has seldom been studied with regards to mechanobiology, in particular resistance to anoikis, a cell death programme triggered by loss of cell adhesion. Here, we show in vitro that migrating breast cancer cells develop resistance to anoikis following their passage through microporous membranes mimicking confined migration (CM), a mechanical constriction that cancer cells encounter during metastasis. This CM-induced resistance was mediated by Inhibitory of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs), and sensitivity to anoikis could be restored after their inhibition using SMAC mimetics. Anoikis-resistant mechanically-stressed cancer cells displayed enhanced cell motility and evasion from natural killer cell-mediated immune surveillance, as well as a marked advantage to form lung metastatic lesions in mice. Our findings reveal that CM increases the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells.",

Recent methods for the automatic root analysis have proposed deep learned segmentation of root images followed by path finding such as Dijkstras algorithm to reconstruct root topology. These approaches assume that roots are separate, and that a shortest path within the image foreground represents a reliable reconstruction of the underlying root structure. This approach is prone to error where roots grow in close proximity, with path finding algorithms prone to taking \"short cuts\" and overlapping much of the root material. Here we extend these methods to also consider root angle, allowing a more informed shortest path search that disambiguates roots growing close together. We adapt a CNN architecture to also predict the angle of root material at each foreground position, and utilise this additional information within shortest path searchers to improve root reconstruction. Our results show an improved ability to separate clustered roots.",

    "abstract": "Maintenance of redox homeostasis is vital for aerobic organisms and particularly relevant to plant pathogens. These need to balance between endogenous ROS production that is required for their development and pathogenicity, and host-derived oxidative stress. Endogenous ROS in fungi are generated by the membrane-bound NADPH oxidase (NOX) complexes and the mitochondrial respiratory chain, while the transcription factor Yap1 is a major regulator of the antioxidant response. Here we investigated the roles of NoxA and Yap1 in fundamental biological processes of the important plant pathogen Verticillium dahliae. Deletion of noxA impaired growth and morphogenesis, compromised formation of hyphopodia, diminished penetration ability and pathogenicity, increased sensitivity against antifungal agents, and dysregulated expression of antioxidant genes. On the other hand, deletion of yap1 resulted in defects in conidial and microsclerotia formation, increased sensitivity against oxidative stress, and down-regulated antioxidant genes. Localized accumulation of ROS was observed before conidial fusion and during the heterokaryon incompatibility reaction upon nonself fusion. The frequency of inviable fusions was not affected by deletion of Yap1. Analysis of a double knockout mutant revealed an epistatic relationship between noxA and yap1. Our results collectively reveal instrumental roles of NoxA and ROS homeostasis in the biology of V. dahliae.",

Here we show that a single intramuscular injection of Adeno-Associated Virus-6 (AAV6) or AAV9 encoding a modified, N-terminal domain deleted ({Delta}NTD) spike protein induces robust cellular immunity and provides long-term protection in k18-hACE2 transgenic mice from lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge, associated weight loss and pneumonia independent of vaccine-induced neutralizing humoral immunity.

Additionally, mice demonstrate a strong Type-1 polarized cellular immunophenotype and equivalent ex vivo T cell reactivity to peptides of wt and alpha (B.1.1.7) variant spike. These studies demonstrate not only that AAV6 and AAV9 can function as effective vaccine platforms, but also that vaccines can provide long-term efficacy primarily through the induction of cellular immunity. The findings may provide an alternative approach to containment of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and have broader implications for the development of variant-agnostic universal vaccines against a wider range of pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Warming climate has increased the frequency and size of high severity wildfires in the western United States, with deleterious impacts on forest ecosystem resilience. Although forest soil microbiomes provide a myriad of ecosystem functions, little is known regarding the impact of high severity fire on microbially-mediated processes. Here, we characterized functional shifts in the soil microbiome (bacterial, fungal, and viral) across wildfire burn severity gradients one year post-fire in coniferous forests (Colorado and Wyoming, USA). We generated the Fire Responding Ecogenomic database (FiRE-db), consisting of 637 metagenome-assembled bacterial genomes, 2490 viral populations, and 2 fungal genomes complemented by 12 metatranscriptomes from soils affected by low and high-severity, and complementary marker gene sequencing and metabolomics data. Actinobacteria dominated the fraction of enriched and active taxa across burned soils. Taxa within surficial soils impacted by high severity wildfire exhibited traits including heat resistance, sporulation and fast growth that enhanced post-fire survival. Carbon cycling within this system was predicted to be influenced by microbial processing of pyrogenic compounds and turnover of dominant bacterial community members by abundant viruses. These genome-resolved analyses across trophic levels reveal the complexity of post-fire soil microbiome activity and offer opportunities for restoration strategies that specifically target these communities.",

    "abstract": "Technological and computational advancements in the fields of genomics and bioinformatics are providing exciting new opportunities for pathogen discovery and surveillance. In particular, single-molecule nucleotide sequence data originating from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing platforms can be bioinformatically leveraged, in real-time, for enhanced biosurveillance of a vast array of zoonoses. The recently released nanopore adaptive sampling (NAS) pipeline facilitates immediate mapping of individual nucleotide molecules (i.e., DNA, cDNA, and RNA) to a given reference as each molecule is sequenced. User-defined thresholds then allow for the retention or rejection of specific molecules, informed by the real-time reference mapping results, as they are physically passing through a given sequencing nanopore. Here, we show how NAS can be used to selectively sequence entire genomes of bacterial tick-borne pathogens circulating in wild populations of the blacklegged tick vector, Ixodes scapularis. The NAS method provided a two-fold increase in targeted pathogen sequences, successfully enriching for Borrelia (Borreliella) burgdorferi s.s.; Borrelia (Borrelia) miyamotoi; Anaplasma phagocytophilum; and Ehrlichia muris eauclairensis genomic DNA within our I. scapularis samples.

The plasmid was eliminated from each isolate by displacement using an incompatible plasmid vector pMDP5_cureEC958. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed to obtain complete chromosome and plasmid sequences of wild-type isolates and to detect chromosomal mutations in plasmid-free strains. Competition assays were conducted to determine the relative fitness of plasmid-free clones compared to the corresponding wild-type isolates.\n\nResultsWe were able to successfully eliminate the IncF plasmids from all of the wild-type strains using the curing vector pMDP5_cureEC958. The chromosomes of plasmid-free clones contained zero to six point mutations. Plasmid-free strains of three isolates showed no significant difference in relative fitness compared to the corresponding plasmid-free strains. In the two remaining isolates, the plasmids produced a small but significant fitness cost.\n\nConclusionWe conclude that IncF plasmids produce moderate fitness effects in their E. coli ST131 H30Rx hosts.

Delta S can fuse membranes more efficiently at low levels of cellular receptor ACE2 and its pseudotyped viruses infect target cells substantially faster than all other variants tested, possibly accounting for its heightened transmissibility. Mutations of each variant rearrange the antigenic surface of the N-terminal domain of the S protein in a unique way, but only cause local changes in the receptor-binding domain, consistent with greater resistance particular to neutralizing antibodies.

To what extent these behaviors are generated by similar vs. distinct mechanisms is unclear. Moreover, the circumstances under which divergent neural mechanisms establish the same behavior, and the molecular signals that regulate the same behavior across conditions, are poorly understood. We show that in C. elegans, distinct neural mechanisms mediate the same chemosensory behavior at two different life stages. Both dauer larvae and starved adults are attracted to carbon dioxide (CO2), but CO2 attraction is mediated by distinct sets of interneurons at the two life stages. Some interneurons mediate CO2 response only in dauers, some show CO2-evoked activity in adults and dauers but contribute to CO2 response only in adults, and some show CO2-evoked activity that opposes CO2 attraction in adults but promotes CO2 attraction in dauers. We also identify a novel role for insulin signaling in establishing life-stage-specific CO2 responses by modulating interneuron activity. Further, we show that a combinatorial code of both shared and life-stage-specific molecular signals regulate CO2 attraction. Our results identify a mechanism by which the same chemosensory behavior can be generated by distinct neural circuits, revealing an unexpected complexity to chemosensory processing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicrobially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) is an ancient property of bacteria, which has recently gained considerable attention for biotechnological applications. It occurs as a by-product of bacterial metabolism and involves a combination of chemical changes in the extracellular environment, e.g. pH increase, and presence of nucleation sites on the cell surface or extracellular substances produced by the bacteria. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning MICP and the interplay between the contributing factors remain poorly understood, thus placing barriers to the full biotechnological and synthetic biology exploitation of bacterial biomineralisation.\n\nResultsIn this study, we adopted a bottom-up approach of systematically engineering Bacillus subtilis, which has no detectable intrinsic MICP activity, for biomineralisation. We showed that heterologous production of urease can induce MICP by local increases in extracellular pH, and this can be enhanced by co-expression of urease accessory genes for urea and nickel uptake, depending on environmental conditions. MICP can be strongly enhanced by biofilm-promoting conditions, which appeared to be mainly driven by production of exopolysaccharide, while the protein component of the biofilm matrix was dispensable. Attempts to modulate the cell surface charge of B. subtilis had surprisingly minor effects, and our results suggest this organism may intrinsically have a very negative cell surface, potentially predisposing it for MICP activity.\n\nConclusionsOur findings give insights into the molecular mechanisms driving MICP in an application-relevant chassis organism and the genetic elements that can be used to engineer de novo or enhanced biomineralisation. This study also highlights mutual influences between the genetic drivers and the chemical composition of the surrounding environment in determining the speed, spatial distribution and resulting mineral crystals of MICP. Taken together, these data pave the way for future rational design of synthetic precipitator strains optimised for specific applications.",

    "abstract": "RaTG13 is a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, sharing 96% sequence similarity at the genome-wide level. The spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of RaTG13 contains a large number of amino acid substitutions when compared to SARS-CoV-2, likely impacting affinity for the ACE2 receptor. Antigenic differences between the viruses are less well understood, especially whether RaTG13 spike can be efficiently neutralised by antibodies generated from infection with, or vaccination against, SARS-CoV-2. Using RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes we compared neutralisation using convalescent sera from previously infected patients as well as vaccinated healthcare workers. Surprisingly, our results revealed that RaTG13 was more efficiently neutralised than SARS-CoV-2. In addition, neutralisation assays using spike chimeras and mutants harbouring single amino acid substitutions within the RBD demonstrated that both spike proteins can tolerate multiple changes without dramatically reducing how efficiently they are neutralised. Moreover, introducing the 484K mutation into RaTG13 resulted in increased neutralisation, in contrast to the same mutation in SARS-CoV-2 (E484K). This is despite E484K having a well-documented role in immune evasion in variants of concern (VOC) such as B.1.351 (Beta). These results indicate that the immune-escape mutations found in SARS-CoV-2 VOCs might be driven by strong antibody pressures, and that the future spill-over of RaTG13 and/or related sarbecoviruses could be mitigated using current SARS-CoV-2-based vaccination strategies.",

    "abstract": "Several strikingly different aerobic and anaerobic pathways of nicotinate utilization had been described in bacteria. No similar work is extant in any eukaryote. Here we elucidate a complete eukaryotic nicotinate utilization pathway, by constructing single or multiple gene deleted strains and identifying metabolic intermediates by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography - high-resolution mass spectrometry. Enzymes catalyzing each step and all intermediate metabolites were identified. We previously established that the cognate eleven genes organized in three clusters constitute a regulon, strictly dependent on HxnR, a pathway-specific transcription factor. The first step, hydroxylation of nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid is analogous to that occurring in bacterial pathways and is catalyzed by an independently evolved molybdenum-containing hydroxylase. The following enzymatic steps have no prokaryotic equivalents: 6-hydroxynicotinic acid is converted to 2,3,6-trihydroxypyridine through 2,5-dihydroxypiridine and the trihydroxylated pyridine ring is then saturated to 5,6-dihydroxypiperidine-2-one followed by the oxidation of the C6 hydroxyl group resulting in 3-hydroxypiperidine-2,6-dione. The latter two heterocyclic compounds are newly identified cellular metabolites, while 5,6-dihydroxypiperidine-2-one is a completely new chemical compound. Ring opening between C and N results in -hydroxyglutaramate, an unprecedented compound in prokaryotic nicotinate catabolic routes. The pathway extant in A. nidulans, and in many other ascomycetes, is different from any other previously analyzed in bacteria. Our earlier phylogenetic analysis of Hxn proteins together with the complete novel biochemical pathway we now describe further illustrates the convergent evolution of catabolic pathways between fungi and bacteria.\n\nSignificance StatementThis eukaryotic nicotinate catabolic pathway illustrates the convergent evolution of prokaryotic and microbial eukaryotic metabolism. It brings to light newly identified metabolites and step processing enzymes. The identification of hitherto undescribed metabolites - which could serve as precursor biosynthetic molecules - is potentially relevant to both pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a foremost bacterial pathogen responsible for a vast array of human diseases. Staphylococcal superantigens (SAgs) constitute a family of potent exotoxins secreted by S. aureus, and SAg genes are found ubiquitously in human isolates. SAgs bind directly to MHC class II molecules and T cell receptors, driving extensive T cell activation and cytokine release. Although these toxins have been implicated in serious disease including toxic shock syndrome, we aimed to further elucidate the mechanisms by which SAgs contribute to staphylococcal pathogenesis during septic bloodstream infections. As most conventional mouse strains respond poorly to staphylococcal SAgs, we utilized transgenic mice encoding humanized MHC class II molecules (HLA-DR4) as these animals are much more susceptible to SAg activity. Herein, we demonstrate that SAgs contribute to the severity of S. aureus bacteremia by increasing bacterial burden, most notably in the liver. We established that S. aureus bloodstream infection severity is mediated by CD4+ T cells and interferon-gamma (IFN{gamma}) is produced to very high levels during infection in a SAg-dependent manner. Bacterial burden and disease severity were reduced by antibody blocking of IFN{gamma}, phenocopying isogenic SAg deletion mutant strains. Additionally, cytokine analysis demonstrated that the immune system was skewed towards a proinflammatory response that was reduced by IFN{gamma} blocking. Infection kinetics and flow cytometry analyses suggested this was a macrophage driven mechanism, which was confirmed through macrophage depletion experiments. Further validation with human leukocytes indicated that excessive IFN{gamma} allowed S. aureus to replicate at a higher rate within macrophages. Together, this suggests that SAgs promote S. aureus survival by manipulating immune responses that would otherwise be effective at clearing S. aureus. This work implicates SAg toxins as critical targets for preventing persistent or severe S. aureus disease.",

Cells lacking Arf6 failed to divide at a threshold surface area and instead shifted to volume-based divisions at increased overall size. Arf6 stably localized to Cdr2 nodes in its GTP-bound but not GDP-bound state, and its GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) Syt22 was required for both Arf6 node localization and proper size at division.

    "abstract": "Neural crest (NC) cells are a dynamic population of embryonic stem cells that create various adult tissues in vertebrate species including craniofacial bone and cartilage and the peripheral and enteric nervous systems. NC development is a conserved and complex process that is controlled by a tightly regulated gene regulatory network (GRN) of morphogens, transcription factors, and cell adhesion proteins. While multiple studies have characterized the expression of several GRN factors in single species, a comprehensive protein analysis that directly compares expression across development is lacking. To address this, we used three closely related avian models, Gallus gallus (chicken), Coturnix japonica (Japanese quail), and Pavo cristatus (Indian peafowl), to compare the localization and timing of four GRN transcription factors, PAX7, SOX9, SNAI2, and SOX10 from the onset of neurulation to migration. While the spatial expression of these factors is largely conserved, we find that quail NC cells express SOX9, SNAI2, and SOX10 proteins at the equivalent of earlier developmental stages than chick and peafowl. In addition, quail NC cells migrate farther and more rapidly than the larger organisms. These data suggest that despite a conservation of NC GRN players, differences in the timing of NC development between species remain a significant frontier to be explored with functional studies.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=145 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/456488v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d4210corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c5d743org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b78d56org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a04059_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Comparative analysis of neural crest (NC) protein spatiotemporal localization in quail, chick, and peafowl embryos.\n\nAvian embryos were incubated for different lengths of time to achieve the same developmental stage marked by somite number (somite stage, SS) as described by Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) in 1951. (A) Quail, (B) chick, and (C) peafowl embryos were collected for immunohistochemistry (IHC) to define and quantify the timeline of NC protein expression. We specifically focused on the expression of PAX7, SNAI2, SOX9, and SOX10 proteins. We determined that neural crest development as marked by common NC-specific proteins differs between species. Rather than similar, but scaled development, each organism has its own NC developmental timeline. Quail embryos develop much more rapidly than their counterparts, chick and peafowl. Further, chick and peafowl amino acid sequences are more similar to each other than they are to quail.\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Argonaute 2 (AGO2) is a ubiquitously expressed protein critical for regulation of mRNA translation and vital to animal development. AGO2 protein is found in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, and while its cytoplasmic role is well studied, the biological relevance of nuclear AGO2 is unclear. Here, we address this problem in vivo, using developing spermatogenic cells as a model. Remarkably, we find that AGO2 acts in the germ cell nucleus to positively regulate protein expression. We show that AGO2 dynamically binds both chromatin and nuclear mRNA transcripts of hundreds of genes required for sperm production, and germline conditional knockout (cKO) of Ago2 causes depletion of the corresponding proteins, along with defects in sperm number and morphology. Nuclear AGO2 partners with splicing, export, and chromatin factors to promote transcript export and protein expression. Together, our data reveal an unexpected role for nuclear AGO2 in enhancing expression of developmentally important genes.",

    "abstract": "UCH37, also known as UCHL5, is a highly conserved deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that associates with the 26S proteasome. Recently it was reported that UCH37 activity is stimulated by branched ubiquitin chain architectures. To understand how UCH37 achieves its unique debranching specificity, we performed biochemical and NMR structural analyses and found that UCH37 is activated by contacts with the hydrophobic patches of both distal ubiquitins that emanate from a branched ubiquitin. In addition, RPN13, which recruits UCH37 to the proteasome, further enhances branched-chain specificity by restricting linear ubiquitin chains from having access to the UCH37 active site. In cultured human cells under conditions of proteolytic stress, we show that substrate clearance by the proteasome is promoted by both binding and deubiquitination of branched polyubiquitin by UCH37. Proteasomes containing UCH37(C88A), which is catalytically inactive, aberrantly retain polyubiquitinated species as well as the RAD23B substrate shuttle factor, suggesting a defect in recycling of the proteasome. These findings provide a foundation to understand how proteasome degradation of substrates modified by a unique ubiquitin chain architecture is aided by a DUB.",

    "abstract": "The structure and function of membrane proteins can be significantly impacted by the surrounding lipid environment, but membrane protein-lipid interactions in lipid bilayers are often difficult to study due to their transient and polydisperse nature. Here, we used two native mass spectrometry (MS) approaches to investigate how the Escherichia coli ammonium transporter (AmtB) and aquaporin Z (AqpZ) selectively remodel their local lipid environment in heterogeneous lipoprotein nanodiscs. First, we used gas-phase ejection to isolate the membrane protein with bound lipids from heterogeneous nanodiscs with different combinations of lipids. Second, we used solution-phase detergent extraction as an orthogonal approach to study membrane protein remodeling of lipids in the nanodisc with native MS. Our results showed that Triton X-100 and LDAO retain lipid selectivity that agrees with gas-phase ejection, but C8E4 distorts some preferential lipid interactions. Both approaches reveal that AmtB has a few selective binding sites for phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids, is selective for binding phosphatidylglycerols (PG) overall, and is nonselective for phosphatidylethanolamines (PE). In contrast, AqpZ prefers either PC or PG over PE and prefers PC over PG. Overall, these experiments provide a detailed picture of how membrane proteins bind different lipid head groups in the context of mixed lipid bilayers.",

    "abstract": "PD-1 acts as a negative regulator of T cell-mediated immune responses in the setting of persistent antigen expression, including cancer and chronic pathogen infections. Antibody-mediated blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis benefits a subset of patients with highly immunogenic malignancies; however, many patients fail to respond due to a requirement for expression of the cell surface ligand PD-L1 within the tumor microenvironment. CISH is a member of a new class of intra-cellular immune checkpoint molecules that function downstream of the T cell receptor to regulate antigen-specific effector functions, including reactivity to cancer neoantigens. Herein, we employed multiplex CRISPR editing of primary human T cells to systematically compare the function of CISH deletion relative to PDCD1 (the gene encoding PD-1) and/or VSIG9 (the gene encoding TIGIT) in a model of neoantigen-mediated cancer cell cytolysis. PD-1 and TIGIT disruption enhanced cytolytic activity exclusively in the setting of high PD-L1 expression. In contrast, CISH inactivation enhanced antigen-specific cytolysis of tumor cells regardless of PD-L1 expression, including outperforming PD-1 and TIGIT disruption even in the presence of high PD-L1 tumor cells. Furthermore, we observed a synergistic increase in tumor cell killing when CISH and PD-1 or TIGIT are inactivated in combination, supporting the notion that these immune checkpoints regulate non-redundant pathways of T cell activation. Together, these data demonstrate that the intra-cellular immune checkpoint protein CISH can potentially enhance anti-tumor responses against a broad range of cancer types regardless of PD-L1 biomarker status.",

    "abstract": "MotivationWith the coronavirus pandemic still raging, prophylactic nasal and early treatment throat sprays could help prevent infection and reduce viral load. Niclosamide has the potential to treat a broad range of viral infections if local bioavailability is optimized as mucin-penetrating solutions as opposed to more traditional microparticle-based sprays that cannot penetrate the mucin.\n\nExperimentalpH-dependence of supernatant concentrations and dissolution rates of niclosamide were measured in buffered solutions by Nanodrop-UV/Vis-spectroscopy for niclosamide from different suppliers, as precipitated material, and as cosolvates. Data was compared to predictions from Henderson Hasselbalch and precipitation pH models. Optimal microscopy was used to observe the morphologies of precipitated and converted niclosamide.\n\nResultsSupernatant-concentrations of niclosamide increased with increasing pH, from 1.77uM at pH 3.66 to 30uM at pH 8, and more rapidly from 90uM at pH8.5 to 300uM at pH 9.1, reaching 641uM at pH 9.5. Logarithmic rates for dissolution increased by [~]3x for pHs 8.62 to 9.44. However, when precipitated from supersaturated solution, niclosamide equilibrated to much lower final supernatant concentrations, reflective of more stable polymorphs at each pH that were also apparent for niclosamide from other suppliers and cosolvates.\n\nConclusionsGiven niclosamides activity against COVID19, its more contagious variants, and other respiratory viral infections, these niclosamide solutions, that put the virus in lockdown, could represent universal prophylactic nasal and early treatment throat sprays. As solutions they would be the simplest and potentially most effective formulations from both an efficacy standpoint as well as manufacturing and distribution, with no cold chain. They now just need testing.",

    "abstract": "Neurogenesis is a complex process encompassing neuronal progenitor cell expansion/proliferation and differentiation, followed by neuron maturation. In vivo models are most commonly used to study neurogenesis; however, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC) neurons are increasingly used to establish cellular models of human neurological processes. Unfortunately, the differentiation and maturation of iPSC-derived neurons varies in methodology, is asynchronous, and has restricted experimental utility because of extended differentiation/maturation times. To accelerate and standardize iPS neuronal maturation, we differentiated and matured feeder layer-free iPSC-derived neuronal cultures under physiological oxygen levels (5%), and modified the underlying extracellular matrix and medium composition. Our results demonstrate that calretinin gene expression occurred earlier under our optimized iPS conditions and the corresponding \"neurogenesis burst\" associated with proliferative expansion occurred more synchronously, reliably emerging two and three weeks after differentiation. As expected, the expression of mature neuronal markers (i.e., NeuN+/Calbindin+) started at 4-weeks post-differentiation. qPCR microarray, western blot and single cell analyses using high content imaging indicated that 4-week iPS neuronal cultures were non-cycling with decreased expression of cyclin D1 and Ki67.

Here we report a novel bioluminescent imaging strategy enabling non-invasive characterization of pathogen load over time. We demonstrate that photon flux from autobioluminescent reporter bacteria can be used to monitor relative pathogen loads in individual animals. Escherichia coli expressing the ilux operon were imaged in whole, living flies at relevant concentrations for immune study. Because animal sacrifice was not necessary to estimate pathogen load, stochastic responses to infection were characterized in individuals over time for the first time. The high temporal resolution of bioluminescence imaging also enabled visualization of the fine dynamics of microbial clearance on the hours time-scale.

Genetic or antibody-based neutralization of the IFNL receptor (IFNLR) resulted in lack of disease maintenance during EAE, with loss of CNS Th1 effector responses and limited axonal injury. Phenotypic effects of IFNLR signaling were traced to increased antigen presenting cell (APC) function, with associated increase in T cell production of IFN{gamma} and GM-CSF. Consistent with this, IFNL levels within lesions of CNS tissues derived from MS patients were elevated compared to MS normal appearing white matter (NAWM). Furthermore, expression of IFNLR was selectively elevated in MS active lesions compared to inactive lesions or NAWM.

    "abstract": "Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in Latin America and is widely distributed worldwide because of migration. After years of infection and in the absence of treatment, the disease progresses from an acute and asymptomatic phase to a chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy, leading to heart failure and death. An inadequate balance in the inflammatory response is involved in the progression of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. Current therapeutic strategies cannot prevent or reverse the heart damage caused by the parasite. Aspirin-triggered resolvin D1 (AT-RvD1) is a pro-resolving mediator of inflammation that acts through N-formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2). AT-RvD1 participates in the modification of cytokine production, inhibition of leukocyte recruitment and efferocytosis, macrophage switching to a nonphlogistic phenotype, and the promotion of healing, thus restoring organ function. In the present study, AT-RvD1 is proposed as a potential therapy aid to regulate the pro-inflammatory state during the chronic phase of Chagas disease. C57BL/6 wild-type and FPR2 knock-out mice chronically infected with T. cruzi were treated for 20 days with 5 g/kg/day AT-RvD1, 30 mg/kg/day benznidazole, or the combination of 5 g/kg/day AT-RvD1 and 5 mg/kg/day benznidazole. At the end of treatment, changes in the immune response, cardiac tissue damage, and parasite load were evaluated. The administration of AT-RvD1 in the chronic phase of T. cruzi infection regulated the inflammatory response both at the systemic level and in the cardiac tissue, and it reduced cellular infiltrates, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and the parasite load in the heart tissue. Thus, AT-RvD1 was shown to be an attractive therapeutic due to its regulatory effect on the inflammatory response at the cardiac level and its ability to reduce the parasite load during chronic T. cruzi infection, thereby preventing the chronic cardiac damage induced by the parasite.\n\nAuthor SummaryChagas disease is prevalent in Latin America and is widely distributed worldwide due to migration. If the parasite is left untreated, the disease progresses from an acute symptomless phase to chronic myocardial inflammation, which can cause heart failure and death years after infection. Imbalances in the inflammatory response are related to this progression. Current treatments cannot prevent or reverse the cardiac damage produced by the parasite. Aspirin-triggered resolvin D1, also named AT-RvD1, can modify cellular and humoral inflammatory responses leading to the resolution of inflammation, thus promoting healing and restoring organ function. In this study, AT-RvD1, in an N-formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2)-dependent manner, was shown to regulate local and systemic inflammation and decrease cellular infiltration in the heart tissue of mice chronically infected with the parasite and reduce cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Importantly, AT-RvD1 was able to decrease parasite load in the infected hearts. Thus, this research indicates that At-RvD1 treatment is a potential therapeutic strategy that offers an improvement on current drug therapies.",

Indeed, homologues of ESCRT-III and the Vps4 ATPase, the proteins that execute the final membrane scission reaction, play analogous roles in cytokinesis and potentially in extracellular vesicle formation in TACK archaea where ESCRT-I and II homologues seem to be absent. Here, we explore the phylogeny, structure, and biochemistry of homologues of the ESCRT machinery and the associated ubiquitylation system found in genome assemblies of the recently discovered Asgard archaea. In these closest living prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes, we provide evidence for the ESCRT-I and II sub-complexes being involved in the ubiquitin-directed recruitment of ESCRT-III,_as it is in eukaryotes. This analysis suggests a pre-eukaryotic origin for the Ub-coupled ESCRT system and a likely path of ESCRT evolution via a series of gene duplication and diversification events.",

    "abstract": "Hox genes encode Homeodomain-containing transcription factors, which specify segmental identities along the anterior-posterior axis. Functional changes in Hox genes have been directly implicated in the evolution of body plans across the metazoan lineage. The Hox protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) is expressed and required in developing third thoracic (T3) segments in holometabolous insects studied so far, particularly, of the order Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera. Ubx function is key to specify differential development of the second (T2) and T3 thoracic segments in these insects. While Ubx is expressed in the third thoracic segment in developing larvae of Hymenopteran Apis mellifera, the morphological differences between T2 and T3 are subtle. To identify evolutionary changes that are behind the differential function of Ubx in these two insects, which are diverged for more than 350 million years, we performed comparative analyses of genome wide Ubx-binding sites between Drosophila and Apis. Our studies reveal that a motif with a TAAAT core is a preferred binding site for Ubx in Drosophila, but not in Apis. Biochemical and transgenic assays suggest that in Drosophila, TAAAT core sequence in the Ubx binding sites is required for Ubx-mediated regulation of two of its target genes studied here. CG13222, a gene that is normally upregulated by Ubx and vestigial (vg), whose expression is repressed by Ubx in T3. Interestingly, changing the TAAT site to a TAAAT site was sufficient to bring an otherwise unresponsive enhancer of the vg gene from Apis under the control of Ubx in a Drosophila transgenic assay. Taken together, our results suggest an evolutionary mechanism by which critical wing patterning genes might have come under the regulation of Ubx in the Dipteran lineage.",

    "abstract": "Morphogenesis is an emergent property of biochemical and cellular interactions during development. Genome size and the correlated trait of cell size can influence these interactions through its effects on developmental rate and tissue geometry, ultimately driving the evolution of morphology. We tested the effects of genome size and body size evolution on heart and liver morphology using nine species of the salamander genus Plethodon (genome sizes 29.3-67 Gb). Our results show that whole organ size is determined by body size, whereas tissue structure changes dramatically with evolutionary increases in genome size. In the heart, increased genome size is correlated with a reduction of myocardia in the ventricle, yielding proportionally less force-producing mass and more empty space. In the liver, increased genome size is correlated with fewer and larger vascular structures, positioning hepatocytes farther from the circulatory vessels that transport key metabolites. Although these structural changes should have obvious impacts on organ function, their effects on organismal performance and fitness are likely negligible because low metabolic rates in salamanders relax selective pressure on key metabolic organ performance. Overall, this study reveals the effects of large genome and cell size on the developmental systems producing the heart and liver.",

    "abstract": "Larval insects use many methods for locomotion. Here we describe a previously unknown jumping behavior in a group of beetle larvae (Coleoptera: Laemophloeidae). We analyze and describe this behavior in Laemophloeus biguttatus and provide information on similar observations for another laemophloeid species, Placonotus testaceus. Laemophloeus biguttatus larvae prelude jumps by arching their body while gripping the substrate with their legs over a period of 0.22 {+/-} 0.17s. This is followed by a rapid ventral curling of the body after the larvae releases its grip that launches them into the air. Larvae reached takeoff velocities of 0.47 {+/-} 0.15 m s-1 and traveled 11.2 {+/-} 2.8 mm (1.98 {+/-} 0.8 body lengths) horizontally and 7.9 {+/-} 4.3 mm (1.5 {+/-} 0.9 body lengths) vertically during their jumps. Conservative estimates of power output revealed that not all jumps can be explained by direct muscle power alone, suggesting Laemophloeus biguttatus uses a latch-mediated spring actuation mechanism (LaMSA) in which interaction between the larvaes legs and the substrate serves as the latch. MicroCT scans and SEM imaging of larvae did not reveal any notable modifications that would aid in jumping. Although more in-depth experiments could not be performed to test hypotheses on the function of these jumps, we posit that this behavior is used for rapid locomotion which is energetically more efficient than crawling the same distance to disperse from their ephemeral habitat. We also summarize and discuss jumping behaviors among insect larvae for additional context of this behavior in laemophloeid beetles.",

It requires software, programming, and understanding of the system to build a model and study it. Softwares exist for systems biology modeling, but most support only certain types of modeling tasks. Desirable features including ease in preparing input, symbolic or analytical computation, parameter estimation, graphical user interface, and systems biology markup language (SBML) support are not seen concurrently in one software package. In this study, we developed a python-based software that supports these features, with both deterministic and stochastic propagations. The software can be used by graphical user interface, command line, or as a python import. We also developed a semi-programmable and intuitively easy topology input method for the biochemical reactions. We tested the software with semantic and stochastic SBML test cases. Tests on symbolic solution and parameter estimation were also included. The software we developed is reliable, well performing, convenient to use, and compliant with most of the SBML tests. So far it is the only systems biology software that supports symbolic, deterministic, and stochastic modeling in one package that also features parameter estimation and SBML support.

    "abstract": "Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) has revolutionized light microscopy by enabling optical resolutions down to a few nanometer. Yet, localization precisions commonly not suffice to visually resolve single subunits in molecular assemblies or multimeric complexes. Since each targeted molecule contributes localizations during image acquisition, molecular counting approaches to reveal the target copy numbers within localization clusters have been continuously proposed since the early days of SMLM, most of which rely on preliminary knowledge of the dye photo-physics or on a calibration to a reference. Previously, we developed localization-based Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (lbFCS) as an absolute ensemble counting approach for the SMLM-variant DNA-Points Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (PAINT), for the first time circumventing the necessity for reference calibrations. Here, we present a revised framework termed lbFCS+ which allows absolute counting of copy numbers for individual localization clusters in a single DNA-PAINT image. In lbFCS+, absolute counting in individual clusters is achieved via precise measurement of the local hybridization rates of the fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotides ( imagers) employed in DNA-PAINT imaging. In proof-of-principle experiments on DNA origami nanostructures, we demonstrate the ability of lbFCS+ to truthfully determine molecular copy numbers and imager association and dissociation rates in well-separated localization clusters containing up to six docking strands. We show that lbFCS+ allows to resolve heterogeneous binding dynamics enabling the distinction of stochastically generated and a priori indistinguishable DNA assemblies. Beyond advancing quantitative DNA-PAINT imaging, we believe that lbFCS+ could find promising applications ranging from bio-sensing to DNA computing.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial chemoreceptors regulate the cytosolic multi-domain histidine kinase CheA through largely unknown mechanisms. Residue substitutions in the peptide linkers that connect the P4 kinase domain to the P3 dimerization and P5 regulatory domain affect CheA basal activity and activation. To understand the role that these linkers play in CheA activity, the P3-to-P4 linker (L3) and P4-to-P5 linker (L4) were extended and altered in variants of Thermotoga maritima (Tm) CheA. Flexible extensions of the L3 and L4 linkers in CheA-LVI (linker variant 1) allowed for a well-folded kinase domain that retained wild-type (WT){-}like binding affinities for nucleotide and normal interactions with the receptor-coupling protein CheW. However, CheA-LV1 autophosphorylation activity registered -50-fold lower compared to WT. Neither a WT nor LV1 dimer containing a single P4 domain could autophosphorylate the P1 substrate domain. Autophosphorylation activity was rescued in variants with extended L3 and L4 linkers that favor helical structure and heptad spacing. Autophosphorylation depended on linker spacing and flexibility and not on sequence. Pulse-dipolar electron-spin resonance (ESR) measurements with spin-labeled ATP analogs indicated that CheA autophosphorylation activity inversely correlated with the proximity of the P4 domains within the dimers of the variants. Despite their separation in primary sequence and space, the L3 and L4 linkers also influence the mobility of the P1 substrate domains. In all, interactions of the P4 domains, as modulated by the L3 and L4 linkers, affect domain dynamics and autophosphorylation of CheA, thereby providing potential mechanisms for receptors to regulate the kinase.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHeart failure (HF) therapeutic toolkit would strongly benefit from the availability of ino-lusitropic agents with a favorable pharmacodynamics and safety profile. Istaroxime is a promising agent, which combines Na+/K+ pump inhibition with SERCA2a stimulation; however, it has a very short half-life and extensive metabolism to a molecule, named PST3093. The present work aims to investigate whether PST3093, still retains the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of its parent compound.\n\nMethodsWe studied PST3093 for its effects on SERCA2a and Na+/K+ ATPase activities, Ca2+ dynamics in isolated myocytes and hemodynamic effects in an in-vivo rat model of diabetic (streptozotocin (STZ)-induced) cardiomyopathy.\n\nResultsIstaroxime infusion in HF patients led to accumulation of PST3093 in the plasma; clearance was substantially slower for PST3093 than for istaroxime. In cardiac rat preparations PST3093 did not inhibit the Na+/K+ ATPase activity, but retained SERCA2a stimulatory activity. In in-vivo echocardiographic assessment, PST3093 improved overall cardiac performance and reversed most STZ-induced abnormalities. PST3093 i.v. toxicity was considerably lower than that of istaroxime and it failed to significantly interact with 50 off-targets.\n\nConclusionsOverall, PST3093 is a \"selective\" SERCA2a activator, the prototype of a novel pharmacodynamic category with a potential in the ino-lusitropic approach to HF with prevailing diastolic dysfunction. Its pharmacodynamics are peculiar and its pharmacokinetics are suitable to prolong the cardiac beneficial effect of istaroxime infusion.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=137 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/455204v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bc9220org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d7a6eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1510c71org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7f037_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Meta-analysis was conducted using STATA version 14.0 and Review Manager version 5.3 softwares. We calculated the weighted mean differences(WMD) to analyze the change of ocular axial length (AL) between orthokeratology combined with 0.01% atropine (OKA) and orthokeratology (OA) alone. The Cochran s Q-statistic and I2 test were used to evaluate potential heterogeneity between studies. To evaluate the influence of single studies on the overall estimate, a sensitivity analysis was performed. We also performed sub group and meta-regression analyses to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity. We conducted Begger s funnel plots and Egger s linear regression tests to investigate publication bias.\n\nResultsNine studies that met all inclusion criteria were included in this meta-analysis. A total of 191 children in OKA group and 196 children in OK group were assessed. The pooled summary WMD of AL change was -0.90(95%CI=-1.25[~]-0.55) with statistical significance(t=-5.03, p<0.01), which indicated there was obvious difference between OKA and OK in myopic children. Subgroup analysis also showed that OKA treatment resulted in significantly less axial elongation compared to OK treatment alone according to SER. We found no evidence for publication bias.\n\nConclusionsOur meta-analysis indicates 0.01% atropine atropine is effective in slowing axial elongation in myopia children with orthokeratology.",

    "abstract": "Calcium imaging using GCaMP indicators and miniature microscopes has been used to image cellular populations during long timescales and in different task phases, as well as to determine neuronal circuit topology and organization. Because the hippocampus (HPC) is essential for tasks of memory, spatial navigation, and learning, calcium imaging of large populations of HPC neurons can provide new insight on cell changes over time during these tasks. All reported HPC in vivo calcium imaging experiments have been done in mouse. However, rats have many behavioral and physiological experimental advantages over mice. In this paper, we present the first (to our knowledge) in vivo calcium imaging from CA1 hippocampus in freely moving male rats. Using the UCLA Miniscope, we demonstrate that, in rat, hundreds of cells can be visualized and held across weeks. We show that calcium events in these cells are highly correlated with periods of movement, with few calcium events occurring during periods without movement. We additionally show that an extremely large percent of cells recorded during a navigational task are place cells (77.3{+/-}5.0%, surpassing the percent seen during mouse calcium imaging), and that these cells enable accurate decoding of animal position and can be held over days with consistent place fields in a consistent spatial map. A detailed protocol is included, and implications of these advancements on in vivo imaging and place field literature are discussed.\n\nSignificance statementIn vivo calcium imaging in freely moving animals allows the visualization of cellular activity across days. In this paper, we present the first in vivo Ca2+ recording from CA1 hippocampus in freely moving rats. We demonstrate that hundreds of cells can be visualized and held across weeks, and that calcium activity corresponds to periods of movement. We show that a high percentage (77.3{+/-}5.0%) of imaged cells are place cells, and that these place cells enable accurate decoding and can be held stably over days with little change in field location. Because the hippocampus is essential for many tasks involving memory, navigation, and learning, imaging of large populations of HPC neurons can shed new insight on cellular activity changes and organization.",

    "abstract": "CD8+ and CD4+ T cells provide cell-mediated cross-protection against multiple influenza strains by recognising epitopes bound as peptides to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and -II molecules respectively. Two challenges in identifying the immunodominant epitopes needed to generate a universal T cell influenza vaccine are: A lack of cell models susceptible to influenza infection which present population-prevalent HLA allotypes, and an absence of a reliable in-vitro method of identifying class II HLA peptides. Here we present a mass spectrometry-based proteomics strategy for identifying viral peptides derived from the A/H3N2/X31 and A/H3N2/Wisconsin/67/2005 strains of influenza. We compared the HLA-I and -II immunopeptidomes presented by ex-vivo influenza challenged human lung tissues. We then compared these with directly infected immortalised macrophage-like cell line (THP1) and primary dendritic cells fed apoptotic influenza-infected respiratory epithelial cells. In each of the three experimental conditions we identified novel influenza class I and II HLA peptides with motifs specific for the host allotype. Ex-vivo infected lung tissues yielded few class-II HLA peptides despite significant numbers of alveolar macrophages, including directly infected ones, present within the tissues. THP1 cells presented HLA-I viral peptides derived predominantly from internal proteins. Primary dendritic cells presented predominantly viral envelope-derived HLA class II peptides following phagocytosis of apoptotic infected cells. The most frequent viral source protein for HLA-I and -II was matrix 1 protein (M1). This work confirms that internal influenza proteins, particularly M1, are a rich source of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of two ex-vivo fully human infection models which enable direct HLA-I and -II immunopeptide identification without significant viral tropism limitations. Application of this epitope discovery strategy in a clinical setting will provide more certainty in rational vaccine design against influenza and other emergent viruses.\n\nAuthor SummaryInfluenza infections present a significant global health challenge. High rates of mutation require reformulation of vaccines annually. Vaccines are designed to induce antibody responses to the surface proteins of the influenza virus, but the contribution of T cells to overall immunity is unclear. Here, we used several totally human laboratory models to show how the viral proteins are presented to the T cells to induce immunity. We found that CD8 T cells, which kill infected cells, and CD4 T cells which support the CD8 T cells as well as the antibody-producing B cells, mainly see proteins from inside the viral particle, not the surface ones which are targeted by antibodies. These internal viral proteins are more similar between different viral strains than the surface proteins, and therefore suggest that vaccines designed to induce T cell responses could be better protective if they target internal viral proteins.",

In our study, the prevalence of Multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant, Carbapenemase-producing, and carbapenem non-susceptible Gram-negative bacilli were, 45.2%, 7.7%, 5.4%, and 15.4% respectively. Out of 66 isolates screened for Carbapenemase, 34.8% (23/66) were Carbapenemase enzyme producers. Ten out of twenty-three Carbapenemase-positive organisms were Metallo-beta-lactamase producers. Thirteen out of twenty-three isolates were serine carbapenemase producers. Three out of 13 serine Carbapenemase positive organisms were Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase.\n\nConclusionThe finding from this study revealed a high prevalence of Multidrug-resistant, extremely drug-resistant, carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria, particularly among Intensive care unit patients at the health facility level, this necessitates a robust laboratory-based antimicrobial resistance monitoring and infection prevention and control program.",

    "abstract": "A newly isolated green microalga, Coelastrum sp. has the capability to produce and accumulate astaxanthin under various stress conditions. At present, a mutant G1-C1 of Coelastrum sp. obtained through chemical mutagenesis using ethyl methane sulfonate displayed an improvement in astaxanthin accumulation, which was 2-fold higher than that of the wild-type. However, lack of genomic information limits the understanding of the molecular mechanism that leads to a high level of astaxanthin in the mutant G1-C1. In this study, transcriptome sequencing was performed to compare the transcriptome of astaxanthin hyper-producing mutant G1-C1 and wild-type of Coelastrum sp. with respect to astaxanthin biosynthesis. This is to clarify why the mutant produced higher astaxanthin yield compared to the wild-type strain. Based on the transcriptomic analysis, the differentially expressed genes involved in astaxanthin biosynthesis were significantly upregulated in the mutant G1-C1 of Coelastrum sp. Genes coding phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase,{zeta} -carotene desaturase, and lycopene {beta}-cyclase involved in {beta}-carotene biosynthesis in the mutant cells were upregulated by 10-, 9.2-, 8.4-, and 8.7-fold, respectively. Genes coding beta-carotene ketolase and beta-carotene 3-hydroxylase involved in converting {beta}-carotene into astaxanthin were upregulated by 7.8- and 8.0-fold, respectively. In contrast, the lycopene {varepsilon}-cyclase gene was downregulated by 9.7-fold in mutant G1-C1. Together, these results contribute to higher astaxanthin accumulation in mutant G1-C1. Overall, the data in this study provided molecular insight for a better understanding of the differences in astaxanthin biosynthesis between the wild-type and mutant G1-C1 strains.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of insoluble amyloid fibrils is widely studied as a critical factor in the pathology of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease. Misfolded Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) was the first protein linked to ALS, and non-native SOD1 trimeric oligomers were recently linked to cytotoxicity, while larger oligomers were protective to cells. The balance between trimers and larger aggregates in the process of SOD1 aggregation is, thus, a critical determinant of potential therapeutic approaches to treat ALS. Yet, it is unknown whether these trimeric oligomers are a necessary intermediate for larger aggregate formation or a distinct off-pathway species competing with fibril formation. Depending on the on- or off-pathway scenario of trimer formation, we expect drastically different therapeutic approaches. Here, we show that the toxic SOD1 trimer is an off-pathway intermediate competing with protective fibril formation. We design mutant SOD1 constructs that remain in a trimeric state (super stable trimers) and show that stabilizing the trimeric SOD1 prevents formation of fibrils in vitro and in a motor neuron like cell model (NSC-34). Using size exclusion chromatography we track the aggregation kinetics of purified SOD1 and show direct competition of trimeric SOD1 with larger oligomer and fibril formation. Finally, we show the trimer is structurally independent of both larger soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils using circular dichroism spectroscopy and limited proteolysis.\n\nSignificance StatementProtein aggregation into large insoluble species is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, but recent evidence suggests that smaller soluble aggregates are responsible for neuronal death. Depending on whether these toxic oligomers appear on- or off-pathway to larger aggregates, which is currently unknown, the strategies for pharmaceutic intervention would be drastically different. Here, we determine that stabilizing the trimeric form of SOD1 reduces larger aggregate formation while increasing toxicity to cells. Trimeric and larger aggregate concentrations have a strong negative correlation over time, and the structure of the trimer is significantly different from larger soluble and insoluble aggregates. Our findings show that formation of trimeric SOD1 is directly competing with that of larger aggregates.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the development of Loop-mediated isothermal amplification of DNA (LAMP) for detection of rose rosette emaravirus (RRV), a technique with the potential to be translated to rose nurseries. RRV is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA Emaravirus and causal agent of the rose rosette disease (RRD). Transmission of RRV is by Phyllocoptes fructiphilus, an eriophyid mite. Although RRV symptoms are characteristics, early visual diagnosis of RRD can be misleading and confusing since it may appear similar to herbicide damage. Two sets of RRV gene sequences composed of twenty-two accessions of RRV-P3 (RNA 3) and another twenty-four from RRV-P4 (RNA 4) were analyzed and two sets of four LAMP primers were designed for broad-range detection of RRV isolates. The direct antigen-capture method for direct trapping of RRV in plastic was used for RNA extraction followed by cDNA synthesis. LAMP reactions were optimized for Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase using the outer RRV-F3/RRV-B3 primers, and internal RRV-FIP/RRV-BIP primers. LAMP reactions were for 1 hour at 64{degrees}C (RRV-P3) and 66.5{degrees}C (RRV-P4) using either a thermocycler or a portable dry bath. LAMP was also optimized using DNA polymerase GspSSD LD using the same RRV sets of primers. RRV was detected in symptomatic and non-symptomatic RRD tissue from Oklahoma. The limit of detection (LoD) using Bst 2.0 LAMP was 1pg/L and 1 fg/L with GspSSD LD quantitative LAMP. The LoD of pre-reaction hydroxy naphthol blue (HNB, 120 M) for colorimetric (visual) reactions was 10 pg/L and 0.1 pg/L using SYBR green I (1:10 dilution) in colorimetric post-reactions. No cross-reactivity was detected in LAMP reaction testing cDNAs of eight commonly co-infecting rose viruses (INSV, ArMV, MSpV, TSWV, ApMV, PNRSV, ToRSV, and TMV), and one virus taxonomically related to RRV (HPWMoV). RNA from healthy rose tissues and non-template controls (water) were included in all LAMP assays.",

Early development was analyzed via a series of montages and images documenting embryos collected from the brood pouches of pregnant males. Despite differences in terminal morphology between pipefish and common teleost models such as medaka and zebrafish, the embryogenesis of these highly advanced fishes is generally similar to that of other fishes. One of the unique features of these fishes is their utilization of an aglomerular kidney. Histological analysis revealed a single long, unbranched kidney tubule in late embryos. The development and structure of this organ was further investigated by cloning the sodium potassium ATPase alpha subunit, atp1a, from S. leptorhynchus and developing whole mount fluorescent in situ hybridization protocols for embryos of this species. Fluorescent stereoscopic and confocal visualization techniques were then used to characterize the 3D morphology of aglomerular kidneys in intact embryos. In all embryonic stages characterized, the aglomerular kidney is a single unbranched tube extending from just behind the head to the cloaca.",

    "abstract": "In spite of its immutable susceptibility to penicillin, Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum) subsp. pallidum continues to cause millions of cases of syphilis each year worldwide, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality and underscoring the urgency of developing an effective vaccine to curtail the spread of the infection. Several technical challenges, including absence of an in vitro culture system until very recently, have hampered efforts to catalog the diversity of strains collected worldwide. Here, we provide near-complete genomes from 196 T. pallidum strains - including 191 T. pallidum subsp. pallidum - sequenced directly from patient samples collected from 8 countries and 6 continents. Maximum likelihood phylogeny revealed that samples from most sites were predominantly SS14 clade. However, 99% (84/85) of the samples from Madagascar formed two of the five distinct Nichols subclades. Although recombination was uncommon in the evolution of modern circulating strains, we found multiple putative recombination events between T. pallidum subsp. pallidum and subsp. endemicum, shaping the genomes of several subclades. Temporal analysis dated the most recent common ancestor of Nichols and SS14 clades to 1717 (95% HPD: 1543-1869), in agreement with other recent studies. Rates of SNP accumulation varied significantly among subclades, particularly among different Nichols subclades, and was associated in the Nichols A subclade with a C394F substitution in TP0380, a ERCC3-like DNA repair helicase. Our data highlight the role played by variation in genes encoding putative surface-exposed outer membrane proteins in defining separate lineages, and provide a critical resource for the design of broadly protective syphilis vaccines targeting surface antigens.\n\nAuthor SummaryEach year, millions of new cases of venereal and congenital syphilis, caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum) subsp. pallidum, are diagnosed worldwide, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Alongside endemic circulation of syphilis in low-income countries, disease resurgence in high-income nations has underscored the need for a vaccine. Due to prior technological limitations in culturing and sequencing the organism, the extent of the genetic diversity within modern strains of T. pallidum subsp. pallidum remains poorly understood, hampering development of a broadly protective vaccine. In this study, we obtained 196 near-complete T. pallidum genomes directly from clinical swabs from eight countries across six continents. Of these, 191 were identified as T. pallidum subsp. pallidum, including 90 Nichols clade genomes. Bayesian analysis revealed a high degree of variance in mutation rate among subclades. Interestingly, a Nichols subclade with a particularly high mutation rate harbors a non-synonymous mutation in a putative DNA repair helicase. Coupling sequencing data with protein structure prediction, we identified multiple novel amino acid variants in several proteins previously identified as potential vaccine candidates. Our data help inform current efforts to develop a broadly protective syphilis vaccine.",

    "abstract": "Pectinolytic enzymes (pectinases) produced by microbes are highly important for their biotechnological use in processing of vegetables and fruits beverages and use in pulp and paper industry. A pectinase, namely endo-polygalacturonase (endo-PGase), encoding gene isolated from Pectobacterium carotovorum, a plant pathogenic strain of bacteria was successfully cloned into a secretion vector pHT43 having {sigma}A-dependent promoter P grac. For enhanced expression analysis, competent cells of Bacillus subtilis (WB800N) were prepared at stationary phase using high salt medium. The recombinant B. subtilis competent cells, harbouring the engineered pHT43 with the endo-PGase gene were cultured in 2X-yeast extract tryptone medium. The recombinant endo-PGase enzyme was secreted directly into the medium after 72 hours of the first IPTG induction. The recombinant endo-PGase was screened for its activity at various temperatures and pH ranges. Optimal activity was found at pH 5.0 and a temperature of 40{degrees}C with a stability ranging from pH 5.0-9.0. For detection of metal ion effect, recombinant enzyme was incubated with 1mM concentration of; Ca++, Mg++, Zn++, EDTA, K++ for 45 minutes. Resultantly, Ca++, EDTA and Zn++ strongly inhibited the enzyme activity. The chromatographic analysis of enzymatic hydrolysate of polygalacturonic acid (PGA) and pectin substrates using HPLC and TLC revealed that tri and tetra-galacturonates were the end products of hydrolysis. The study led to the conclusion that endo-PGase gene from the plant pathogenic strain was successfully expressed in Bacillus subtilis and could be assessed for enzyme production using a very simple medium with IPTG induction. These findings proposed that the Bacillus expression system might be safe for commercial enzyme production as compared to yeast and fungi to escape endotoxins.",

    "abstract": "A number of neurologic diseases, including a form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and others associated with expanded nucleotide repeats have an unconventional form of translation called repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. Repeat protein products accumulate and are hypothesized to contribute to disease pathogenesis. It has been speculated that the repeat regions in the RNA fold into secondary structures in a length-dependent manner, promoting RAN translation. Additionally, nucleotides that flank the repeat region, especially ones closest to the initiation site, are believed to enhance translation initiation. Recently, a machine learning model based on a large number of flanking nucleotides has been proposed for identifying translation initiation sites. However, most likely due to its extensive feature selection and limited training data, the model has diminished predictive power. Here, we overcome this limitation and increase prediction accuracy by a) capturing the effect of nucleotides most critical for translation initiation via feature reduction, b) implementing an alternative machine learning algorithm better suited for limited data, c) building comprehensive and balanced training data (via sampling without replacement) that includes previously unavailable sequences, and, d) splitting ATG and near-cognate translation initiation codon data to train two separate models. We also design a supplementary scoring system to provide an additional prognostic assessment of model predictions. The resultant models have high performance, with 85.00-87.79% accuracy exceeding that of the previously published model by >18%. The models presented here are then used to identify translation initiation sites in genes associated with a number of neurologic repeat expansion disorders. The results confirm a number of experimentally discovered sites of translation initiation upstream of the expanded repeats and predict many sites that are not yet established.",

    "abstract": "The mouse is a useful preclinical species for evaluating disease etiology due to the availability of a wide variety of genetically modified strains and the ability to perform disease-modifying manipulations. In order to better characterize atrial fibrillation (AF), we profiled several commonly used murine AF models. We initially evaluated a pharmacological model of acute carbachol (CCh) treatment plus atrial burst pacing in C57BL/6 mice. In an effort to observe micro-reentrant circuits indicative of authentic AF, we employed optical mapping imaging in isolated mouse hearts. While CCh reduced atrial refractoriness and increased atrial tachyarrhythmia vulnerability, the left atrial (LA) excitation patterns were rather regular without reentrant circuits or wavelets. Therefore, the atrial tachyarrhythmia resembled high frequency atrial flutter, not typical AF per se. We next examined both a chronic angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion model and the surgical model of transverse aortic constriction (TAC), which have both been reported to induce atrial and ventricular structural changes that serve as a substrates for micro-reentrant AF. Although we observed some extent of atrial remodeling such as fibrosis or enlarged LA diameter, burst pacing-induced atrial tachyarrhythmia vulnerability did not differ from control mice in either model. This again suggested that an AF-like pathophysiology is difficult to demonstrate in the mouse. To continue searching for a valid murine AF model, we studied mice with a cardiac-specific deficiency (KO) in liver kinase B1 (Cardiac-LKB1), which has been reported to exhibit spontaneous AF. Indeed, the electrocardiograms (ECG) of conscious Cardiac-LKB1 KO mice exhibited no P waves and had irregular RR intervals, which are characteristics of AF. Histological evaluation of Cardiac-LKB1 KO mice revealed dilated and fibrotic atria, again consistent with AF. However, atrial electrograms and optical mapping revealed that electrical activity was limited to the sino-atrial node area with no electrical conduction into the atrial myocardium beyond. Thus, Cardiac-LKB KO mice have severe atrial myopathy or atrial standstill, but not AF. In summary, the atrial tachyarrhythmias we observed in the four murine models were distinct from typical human AF, which often exhibits micro- or macro-reentrant atrial circuits. Our results suggest that the four murine AF models we examined are poor representations of human AF, and raise a cautionary note about the use of any murine model to study AF.",

    "abstract": "We employed Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry for high-resolution mapping of marine phytoplankton photophysiology and primary productivity in the Lancaster Sound and Barrow Strait regions of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago in the summer of 2019. Continuous ship-board analysis of chlorophyll a variable fluorescence demonstrated relatively low photochemical efficiency over most of the cruise-track, with the exception of localized regions within Barrow Strait where there was increased vertical mixing and proximity to land-based nutrient sources. Along the full transect, we observed strong non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence, with relaxation times longer than the 5-minute period used for dark acclimation. Such long-term quenching effects complicate continuous underway acquisition of fluorescence amplitude-based estimates of photosynthetic electron transport rates, which rely on dark acclimation of samples. As an alternative, we employed a new algorithm to derive electron transport rates based on analysis of fluorescence relaxation kinetics, which does not require dark acclimation. Direct comparison of kinetics- and amplitude-based electron transport rate measurements demonstrated kinetic-based estimates were, on average, 2-fold higher than amplitude-based values. The magnitude of decoupling between the two electron transport rate estimates increased in association with photophysiological diagnostics of nutrient stress. Discrepancies between electron transport rate estimates likely resulted from the use of different photophysiological parameters to derive the kinetics- and amplitude-based algorithms, and choice of numerical model used to fit variable fluorescence curves and analyze fluorescence kinetics under actinic light. Our results highlight environmental and methodological influences on fluorescence-based productivity estimates, and prompt discussion of best-practices for future underway fluorescence-based efforts to monitor phytoplankton photosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Blanket curtailment of turbine operations during low wind conditions has become an accepted operational minimization tactic to reduce bat mortality at terrestrial wind facilities. Site-specific studies have demonstrated that operational curtailment effectively reduces impacts, but the exact nature of the relationship between increased cut-in speed and fatality reduction in bats remains unclear. To evaluate the efficacy of differing blanket curtailment regimes in reducing bat fatality, we examined data from turbine curtailment experiments in the United States and Canada in a meta-analysis framework. We tested multiple statistical models to explore possible linear and non-linear relationships between turbine cut-in speed and bat fatality reduction while controlling for control cut-in speed. Because the overall sample size for this meta-analysis was small (n = 36 control-treatment studies from 16 field sites from the American Wind Wildlife Information Center and a recent review), we conducted a power analysis to assess the number of control-impact curtailment studies that would be needed to understand the relationship between fatality rate and change in cut-in speed under different fatality reduction scenarios. We also identified the characteristics of individual field studies that may influence their power to detect fatality reduction due to curtailment. Using a response ratio approach, we found any curtailment strategy reduced fatality rates by 56% for studies included in this analysis (p < 0.001). However, we did not find strong evidence for linear (p =0 0.07) or non-linear (p > 0.11) associations between increasing cut-in speeds and fatality reduction. The power analyses showed that the power to detect effects in the meta-analysis was low if fatality reductions were less than 50%. Synthesizing across all analyses, we need more well-designed curtailment studies to determine the effect of increasing curtailment speed and the effect size is likely of a magnitude that we had limited power to detect.",
