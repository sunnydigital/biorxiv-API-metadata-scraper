    "abstract": "Salinized hydroponic culture experiment with three salinity levels (EC control, 6 and 12 dS/m) was performed to screen salt tolerant mutants of aerobic rice cultivar Nagina 22 and to study the nature of salt tolerance from a total of 432 EMS induced M4 mutants. Plants were harvested 30 days after sowing. Growth parameters viz. root weight, shoot weight, root length, shoot length, Na and K concentrations in shoot and roots were measured. Combined Factor scores of growth parameters was computed by Principle Component Analysis using Minitab software.\n\nAt EC 12 dS/m 10 mutants out of 432 were able to survive. At moderate salinity, some mutant lines produced higher shoot weight compared to their respective control showing inverse trend and the effectiveness of EMS induced mutation in inducing salinity tolerance to these mutants. At high salinity only10 mutants survived (remained green) up to the time of 30 days harvest. These mutants performed well in terms of overall growth recording 2.1-2.5 times higher factor score and 8-14 times higher shoot weight compared to the N 22 check. One mutant N22-L-1010 almost completely excluded Na at xylem parenchyma level. Two other mutants N22-L-1013 and N22-L-806 maintained Na exclusion compared to the N22 check. N22 check and mutant N22-L-1009 maintained similar degree of Na exclusion though the N22 check died because it cannot maintain adequate K in shoot.\n\nWe conclude that EMS has induced salinity tolerance in some mutants. The study can be advanced further to characterize the putative mutants through molecular genetics approaches.",

CBS domains share a much larger interacting area with a conserved catalytic domain in comparison with the only known CBS containing protozoan GMPR and closely related inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase structures. Our results revealed essential effect of pH on allosteric regulation of Msm GMPR activity and oligomerization with adenine and guanosine nucleotides binding to CBS domains.Bioinformatic analysis indicated the presence of GMPRs containing CBS domains across the entire Actinobacteria phylum.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus (SA) leukocidin LukED belongs to a family of bicomponent pore forming toxins that play important roles in SA immune evasion and nutrient acquisition. LukED targets specific G protein-coupled chemokine receptors to lyse human erythrocytes and leukocytes. The first recognition step of receptors is critical for specific cell targeting and lysis. The structural and molecular bases for this mechanism are not well understood but could constitute essential information to guide antibiotic development. Here, we characterized the interaction of LukE with chemokine receptors ACKR1, CCR2 and CCR5 using a combination of structural, pharmacological and computational approaches. First, crystal structures of LukE in complex with a small molecule mimicking sulfotyrosine side chain (p-cresyl sulfate) and with peptides containing sulfotyrosines issued from receptor sequences revealed the location of receptor sulfotyrosine binding sites in the toxins. Then, by combining the available experimental information with protein docking, classical and accelerated weight histogram (AWH) molecular dynamics we propose models of the ACKR1-LukE and CCR5-LukE complexes. This work provides novel insights into chemokine receptor recognition by leukotoxins and suggests that the conserved sulfotyrosine binding pocket could be a target of choice for future drug development.",

PUL studies are blooming in recent years but the biochemical characterization speed is relative slow. There is a growing demand for PUL database with function annotations.\n\nResultsUsing signature genes corresponding for specific polysaccharide, 10422 PULs specific for 6 polysaccharides (agar, alginate, pectin, carrageenan, chitin and {beta}-manan) from various bacterial phyla were predicted. Then online website of specific functional polysaccharide utilization loci (Sift-PULs) was constructed. Sift-PULs provides a repository where users could browse, search and download interested PULs without registration.\n\nConclusionsThe key advantage of Sift-PULs is to assign a function annotation of each PUL, which is not available in existing PUL databases. PULs functional annotation lays a foundation for studying novel enzymes, new pathways, PUL evolution or bioengineering. The website is available on https://sift-puls.org",

    "abstract": "During anaphase B, molecular motors slide interpolar microtubules to elongate the mitotic spindle, contributing to the separation of chromosomes. However, sliding of antiparallel microtubules reduces their overlap, which may lead to spindle breakage, unless microtubules grow to compensate sliding. How sliding and growth are coordinated is still poorly understood. In this study, we have used the fission yeast S. pombe to measure microtubule dynamics during anaphase B. We report that the coordination of microtubule growth and sliding relies on promoting rescues at the midzone edges. This makes microtubules stable from pole to midzone, while their distal parts including the plus ends alternate between assembly and disassembly. Consequently, the midzone keeps a constant length throughout anaphase, enabling sustained sliding without the need for a precise regulation of microtubule growth speed. Additionally, we found that in S. pombe, which undergoes closed mitosis, microtubule growth speed decreases when the nuclear membrane wraps around the spindle midzone.",

    "abstract": "Mutations to the human kinome are known to play causal roles in cancer. The kinome regulates numerous cell processes including growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In addition to aberrant expression, aberrant alternative splicing of cancer-driver genes is receiving increased attention as it could create loss or gain of functional domains, altering a kinases downstream effects.\n\nThe present study quantifies changes in gene expression and isoform ratios in the kinome of metastatic melanoma cells relative to primary tumors. We contrast 538 total kinases and 3042 known kinase isoforms between 103 primary tumor and 367 metastatic samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We find strong evidence of differential expression (DE) at the gene level in 123 genes (23%). Additionally, of the 468 genes with alternative isoforms, 60 (13%) had differential isoform ratios (DIR). Notably, DE and DIR have little correlation; for instance, although DE highlights enrichment in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), DIR identifies altered splicing in non-receptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs). Using exon junction mapping, we identify five examples of splicing events favored in metastatic samples.\n\nWe cluster isoform expression data and identify subgroups that correlate with genomic subtypes and anatomic tumor locations. Notably, distinct DE and DIR patterns separate samples with BRAF hotspot mutations and (N/K/H)RAS hotspot mutations, the latter of which lacks effective kinase inhibitor treatments. DE in RAS mutants concentrates in CMGC kinases (a group including cell cycle and splicing regulators) rather than RTKs as in BRAF mutants. Furthermore, isoforms in the RAS kinase subgroup show enrichment for cancer-related processes such as angiogenesis and cell migration. Our results reveal a new approach to therapeutic target identification and demonstrate how different mutational subtypes may respond differently to treatments highlighting possible new driver events in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Two dominant processes organizing chromosomes are loop extrusion and the compartmental segregation of active and inactive chromatin. The molecular players involved in loop extrusion during interphase, cohesin and CTCF, have been extensively studied and experimentally validated. However, neither the molecular determinants nor the functional roles of compartmentalization are well understood. Here, we distinguish three inactive chromatin states using contact frequency profiling, comprising two types of heterochromatin and a previously uncharacterized inactive state exhibiting a neutral interaction preference. We find that heterochromatin marked by long continuous stretches of H3K9me3, HP1 and HP1{beta} correlates with a conserved signature of strong compartmentalization and is abundant in HCT116 colon cancer cells. We demonstrate that disruption of DNA methyltransferase activity dramatically remodels genome compartmentalization as a consequence of the loss of H3K9me3 and HP1 binding. Interestingly, H3K9me3-HP1/{beta} is replaced by the neutral inactive state and retains late replication timing. Furthermore, we show that H3K9me3-HP1/{beta} heterochromatin is permissive to loop extrusion by cohesin but refractory to CTCF, explaining a paucity of visible loop extrusion-associated patterns in Hi-C. Accordingly, CTCF loop extrusion barriers are reactivated upon loss of H3K9me3-HP1/{beta}, not as a result of canonical demethylation of the CTCF binding motif but due to an intrinsic resistance of H3K9me3-HP1/{beta} heterochromatin to CTCF binding. Together, our work reveals a dynamic structural and organizational diversity of the inactive portion of the genome and establishes new connections between the regulation of chromatin state and chromosome organization, including an interplay between DNA methylation, compartmentalization and loop extrusion.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThree inactive chromatin states are distinguishable by long-range contact frequencies in HCT116, respectively associated with H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and a H3K9me2 state with neutral contact preferences.\nC_LIO_LIH3K9me3-HP1/{beta} heterochromatin has a high degree of homotypic affinity and is permissive to loop extrusion but depleted in extrusion barriers.\nC_LIO_LIDisrupting DNA methylation causes widespread loss of H3K9me3-HP1/{beta} and dramatic remodeling of genome compartmentalization.\nC_LIO_LIH3K9me3-HP1/{beta} is replaced by the neutral inactive state, which gains CTCF loop extrusion barriers and associated contact frequency patterns.\nC_LIO_LIDNA methylation suppresses CTCF binding via two distinct mechanisms.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics of the {beta}-lactam (penicillin) family inactivate target enzymes called D,D-transpeptidases or penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that catalyze the last cross-linking step of peptidoglycan synthesis. The resulting net-like macromolecule is the essential component of bacterial cell walls that sustains the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm. In Escherichia coli, bypass of PBPs by the YcbB L,D-transpeptidase leads to resistance to these drugs. We developed a new method based on heavy isotope labeling and mass spectrometry to elucidate PBP- and YcbB-mediated peptidoglycan polymerization. PBPs and YcbB similarly participated in single-strand insertion of glycan chains into the expanding bacterial side wall. This absence of any transpeptidase-specific signature suggests that the peptidoglycan expansion mode is determined by other components of polymerization complexes. YcbB did mediate {beta}-lactam resistance by insertion of multiple strands that were exclusively cross-linked to existing tripeptide-containing acceptors. We propose that this unprecedented mode of polymerization depends upon accumulation of linear glycan chains due to PBP inactivation, formation of tripeptides due to cleavage of existing cross-links by a {beta}-lactam-insensitive endopeptidase, and concerted cross-linking by YcbB.",

    "abstract": "Caspases are a family of cysteinyl proteases that control programmed cell death and maintain homeostasis in multicellular organisms. The caspase family is an excellent model to study protein evolution because all caspases are produced as zymogens (procaspases) that must be activated to gain full activity; the protein structures are conserved through hundreds of millions of years of evolution; and some allosteric features arose with the early ancestor while others are more recent evolutionary events. The apoptotic caspases evolved from a common ancestor into two distinct subfamilies: monomers (initiator caspases) or dimers (effector caspases). Differences in activation mechanisms of the two subfamilies, and their oligomeric forms, play a central role in the regulation of apoptosis. Here, we examine changes in the folding landscape by characterizing human effector caspases and their common ancestor. The results show that the effector caspases unfold by a minimum three-state equilibrium model at pH 7.5, where the native dimer is in equilibrium with a partially folded monomeric (procaspase-7, common ancestor) or dimeric (procaspase-6) intermediate. In comparison, the unfolding pathway of procaspase-3 contains both oligomeric forms of the intermediate. Overall, the data show that the folding landscape was first established with the common ancestor and was then retained for >650 million years. Partially folded monomeric or dimeric intermediates in the ancestral ensemble provide mechanisms for evolutionary changes that affect stability of extant caspases. The conserved folding landscape allows for the fine-tuning of enzyme stability in a species-dependent manner while retaining the overall caspase-hemoglobinase fold.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of the ERBB/EGFR signalling pathway causes multiple types of cancer (1, 2). Accordingly, ADAM17, the primary shedding enzyme that releases and activates ERBB ligands, is tightly regulated. It has recently become clear that iRhoms, inactive members of the rhomboid-like superfamily, are regulatory cofactors for ADAM17 (3, 4). Here we show that oncogenic KRAS mutants target the cytoplasmic domain of iRhom2 to induce ADAM17-dependent shedding and the release of ERBB ligands. Activation of ERK1/2 by oncogenic KRAS induces the phosphorylation of iRhom2, recruitment of the phospho-binding 14-3-3 proteins, and consequent ADAM17-dependent shedding of ERBB ligands. In addition, cancer-associated mutations in iRhom2 act as sensitisers in this pathway by further increasing KRAS-induced shedding of ERBB ligands. This mechanism is conserved in lung cancer cells, where iRhom activity is required for tumour xenograft growth. In this context, the activity of oncogenic KRAS is modulated by the iRhom2-dependent release of ERBB ligands, thus placing iRhom2 as a central component of a positive feedback loop in lung cancer cells. Overall, the cytoplasmic domain of iRhom2 is a critical component of KRAS-induced oncogenesis of lung cancer cells. Both ADAM17 and iRhom2 have also been implicated in a wide range of other cancers (5-10), so the mechanism we have revealed may also have wider oncogenic significance.",

    "abstract": "Tumour spheroids are common in vitro experimental models of avascular tumour growth. Compared with traditional two-dimensional culture, tumour spheroids more closely mimic the avascular tumour microenvironment where spatial differences in nutrient availability strongly influence growth. We show that spheroids initiated using significantly different numbers of cells grow to similar limiting sizes, suggesting that avascular tumours have a limiting structure; in agreement with untested predictions of classical mathematical models of tumour spheroids. We develop a novel mathematical and statistical framework to study the structure of tumour spheroids seeded from cells transduced with fluorescent cell cycle indicators, enabling us to discriminate between arrested and cycling cells and identify an arrested region. Our analysis shows that transient spheroid structure is independent of initial spheroid size, and the limiting structure can be independent of seeding density. Standard experimental protocols compare spheroid size as a function of time; however, our analysis suggests that comparing spheroid structure as a function of overall size produces results that are relatively insensitive to variability in spheroid size. Our experimental observations are made using two melanoma cell lines, but our modelling framework applies across a wide range of spheroid culture conditions and cell lines.",

    "abstract": "ASH1L and MLL1 are two histone methyltransferases that facilitate transcriptional activation during normal development. However, the roles of ASH1L and its enzymatic activity in the development of MLL-rearranged leukemias are not fully elucidated in the Ash1L gene knockout animal models. In this study, we used an Ash1L conditional knockout mouse model to show that loss of ASH1L in hematopoietic progenitor cells impaired the initiation of MLL-AF9-induced leukemic transformation in vitro. Furthermore, genetic deletion of ASH1L in the MLL-AF9-transformed cells impaired the maintenance of leukemic cells in vitro and largely blocked the leukemia progression in vivo. Importantly, the loss of ASH1L function in the Ash1L-deleted cells could be rescued by wild-type but not the catalytic-dead mutant ASH1L, suggesting the enzymatic activity of ASH1L was required for its function in promoting MLL-AF9-induced leukemic transformation. At the molecular level, ASH1L enhanced the MLL-AF9 target gene expression by directly binding to the gene promoters and modifying the local histone H3K36me2 levels. Thus, our study revealed the critical functions of ASH1L in promoting the MLL-AF9-induced leukemogenesis, which provides a molecular basis for targeting ASH1L and its enzymatic activity to treat MLL-arranged leukemias.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the form of insertions and deletions (INDEL) in the calreticulin gene lead to essential thrombocythemia which is characterized by the formation of thrombosis. However, the connection between calreticulin INDEL and essential thrombocythemia remains largely elusive. Through combined molecular dynamics simulation and in-vitro studies on the wild type and mutated isoforms of calreticulin, the mechanism underlying the calreticulin INDEL induced essential thrombocythemia was investigated at the molecular level. Our results demonstrate that mutations in exon-9 could lead to significant conformational variations of calreticulin structure and thereby reducing its interaction with calcium ions due to decreased electrostatic contributions. The consequence of mutations on calreticulins structural integrity was revealed by identifying the key residues and their roles in calcium binding. Furthermore, mutations implemented by CRISPR-Cas9 in exon-9 showed diminished calcium signaling in HEK-293T cells, which agree well with our in-silico findings. The current study might help in understanding of the interactions between calreticulin exon-9 INDEL and calcium ions mediated by the structural variations of calreticulin. The results provide useful information for designing novel therapeutic approaches targeting essential thrombocythemia.",

Changes in protein expression are central determinants of cancer phenotypes that reflect potential therapeutic targets. However, previous proteomic studies did not address internal heterogeneity, therefore, masked the necessary spatial resolution to achieve a comprehensive understanding of cancer complexity. Here we present the first large-scale multi-focal breast cancer proteomic study of 330 tumor regions which associated cancer cell function, pathological parameters, and spatial localization of each tumor region. We found marked internal proteomic heterogeneity even within tumors presenting homogeneous receptor expression. Additionally, analysis of the internal heterogeneity, based on coexisting receptor expression or histological patterns in single tumors, showed significant functional differences between homogeneous and heterogeneous tumors related to cancer metabolism, immunogenicity, and proliferation. We anticipate that this study will serve as a starting point towards the development of improved cancer therapy and diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "Maintenance of energy balance is essential for the overall health of an organism. In mammals, both negative and positive energy balance are associated with disease states. To maintain their energy balance within a defined homeostatic setpoint, mammals have evolved complex regulatory mechanisms that control energy intake and expenditure. Traditionally, studies have focused on understanding the role of macronutrient physiology in energy balance. In the present study, we examined the role of the essential micronutrient iron in regulating energy balance. Using a dietary model, we found that a short course of excess dietary iron caused a negative energy balance resulting in a severe whole body wasting phenotype. This disruption in energy balance was due to an iron dependent increase in energy expenditure caused by a heightened basal metabolic rate and activity level. Using a transgenic mouse model lacking adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) specifically in fat tissue, we found that to meet the increased energetic demands, dietary iron caused increased lipid utilization that required fat specific ATGL-mediated lipid mobilization and wasting of subcutaneous white adipose tissue deposits. When fed dietary iron, mice lacking fat-specific ATGL activity were protected from fat wasting, and developed a severe cachectic response that is necessary to meet the increased energetic demands caused by the dietary regimen. Our work highlights the multi-faceted role of iron regulation of organismal metabolism and provides a novel in vivo mechanism for micronutrient control of lipolysis that is necessary for regulating mammalian energy balance.",

    "abstract": "Soybean is one of the major sources of edible protein and oil. Oil content is a quantitative trait that is significantly determined by genetic and environmental factors. Over the past 30 years, a large volume of soybean genetic, genomic, and transcriptomic data have been accumulated. Nevertheless, integrative analyses of such data remain scarce, in spite of their importance for crop improvement. We hypothesized that the co-occurrence of genomic regions for oil-related traits in different studies may reveal more stable regions encompassing important genetic determinants of oil content and quality in soybean. We integrated publicly available data, obtained with distinct techniques, to discover and prioritize candidate genes involved in oil biosynthesis and regulation in soybean. We detected key fatty acid biosynthesis genes (e.g., BCCP and ACCase, FADs, KAS family proteins) and several transcripton factors, which are likely regulators of oil biosynthesis. In addition, we identified new candidates for seed oil accumulation and quality, such as Glyma.03G213300 and Glyma.19G160700, which encode a translocator protein and a histone acetyltransferase, respectively. Further, oil and protein genomic hotspots are strongly associated with breeding and not with domestication, suggesting that soybean domestication prioritized other traits. The genes identified here are promising targets for breeding programs and for the development of soybean lines with increased oil content and quality.",

This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of shading on the vegetative growth of strawberry cv. Sweet Ann under water deficit. The treatments consisted of the combination of two levels of shading (light intensity reduced on 47% vs. non-shaded plants) and two levels of water availability (water deficit vs. well-watered plants). The water deficit reduced the leaf water potential from -1.52 to -2.21 MPa, and diminished stomatal conductance, net photosynthetic rate (from 9.13 to 2.5 mol m-2 s-1), photosystem II photochemical efficiency (from 0.79 to 0.67), and biomass accumulation, while increased the electrolyte leakage. The shading allowed the water-deficient plants to maintain water potential (-1.58 MPa) and photosystem II efficiency (0.79) and to increase water use efficiency (from 14.80 to 86.90 mol CO2/mmol H2O), net photosynthetic rate (from 2.40 to 9.40 mol m-2 s-1) and biomass of leaves, crowns, and roots compared to non-shaded plants without water limitation. These results suggest that a reduction in incident light intensity attenuates the effects of stomatic and non-stomatic limitations caused by water deficit during vegetative growth of strawberry.",

    "abstract": "One of the key concepts employed in cancer driver gene identification is that of mutual exclusivity (ME); a driver mutation is less likely to occur in case of an earlier mutation that has common functionality in the same molecular pathway. Several ME tests have been proposed recently, however the current protocols to evaluate ME tests have two main limitations. Firstly the evaluations are mostly with respect to simulated data and secondly the evaluation metrics lack a network-centric view. The latter is especially crucial as the notion of common functionality can be achieved through searching for interaction patterns in relevant networks. We propose a network-centric framework to evaluate the pairwise significances found by statistical ME tests. It has three main components. The first component consists of metrics employed in the network-centric ME evaluations. Such metrics are designed so that network knowledge and the reference set of known cancer genes are incorporated in ME evaluations under a careful definition of proper control groups. The other two components are designed as further mechanisms to avoid confounders inherent in ME detection on top of the network-centric view. To this end, our second objective is to dissect the side effects caused by mutation load artifacts where mutations driving tumor subtypes with low mutation load might be incorrectly diagnosed as mutually exclusive. Finally, as part of the third main component, the confounding issue stemming from the use of nonspecific interaction networks generated as combinations of interactions from different tissues is resolved through the creation and use of tissue-specific networks in the proposed framework.

We aimed to understand barriers hindering the uptake of genomics, and how to overcome them, via exploratory interviews with leading scholars in both restoration and its sister discipline of conservation - a discipline that has successfully leveraged genomics. We also conducted an examination of research trends to explore some insights that emerged from the interviews, including publication trends that have used genomics to address restoration and conservation questions. Our qualitative findings revealed varied perspectives in harnessing genomics. For example, scholars in restoration without genomics experience felt genomics was over-hyped. Scholars with genomics experience emphatically emphasised the need to proceed cautiously in using genomics in restoration. Both genomics-experienced and less-experienced scholars called for case studies to demonstrate the benefits of genomics in restoration. These qualitative data contrasted with our examination of research trends, which revealed 70 restoration genomics studies, particularly studies using environmental DNA as a monitoring tool. We provide a roadmap to facilitate the uptake of genomics into restoration, to help the restoration sector meet the monumental task of restoring huge areas to biodiverse and functional ecosystems.",

Seipin forms a decameric, cage-like structure with the lumenal domains forming a stable ring at the cage floor and transmembrane segments forming the cage sides and top. The transmembrane segments interact with adjacent monomers in two distinct, alternating conformations. These conformations result from changes in switch regions, located between the lumenal domains and the transmembrane segments, that are required for seipin function. Our data suggest a model for LD formation in which a closed seipin cage enables TG phase separation and subsequently switches to an open conformation to allow LD growth and budding.",

During development, common KRT8 progenitors generate committed unilineage p63/KRT5-squamous and KRT8-columnar stem cells responsible for the regeneration of postnatal esophagus and gastric epithelium that meet at GEJ. A unique spatial distribution of Wnt regulators in the underlying stromal compartment of these stem cells creates diverging Wnt microenvironments at GEJ and supports their differential regeneration.

    "abstract": "BackgroundEcosystem restoration is as a critical tool to counteract the decline of biodiversity and recover vital ecosystem services. Restoration efforts, however, often fall short of meeting their goals. Although functionally important levels of biodiversity can significantly contribute to the outcome of ecosystem restoration, they are often overlooked. One such important facet of biodiversity is within-species genetic diversity, which is fundamental to population fitness and adaptation to environmental change. Also the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), obligate root symbionts that regulate nutrient and carbon cycles, potentially plays a vital role in mediating ecosystem restoration outcome. In this study, we investigated the relative contribution of intraspecific population genetic diversity, AMF diversity, and their interaction, to population recovery of Succisa pratensis, a key species of nutrient poor semi natural grasslands. We genotyped 180 individuals from 12 populations of S. pratensis and characterized AMF composition in their roots, using microsatellite markers and next generation amplicon sequencing, respectively. We also investigated whether the genetic makeup of the host plant species can structure the composition of root-inhabiting AMF communities.\n\nResultsOur analysis revealed that population allelic richness was strongly positively correlated to relative population growth, whereas AMF richness and its interaction with population genetic diversity did not significantly contribute. The variation partitioning analysis showed that, after accounting for soil and spatial variables, the plant genetic makeup explained a small but significant part of the unique variation in AMF communities.\n\nConclusionsOur results confirm that population genetic diversity can contribute to population recovery, highlighting the importance of within-species genetic diversity for the success of restoration. We could not find evidence, however, that population recovery benefits from the presence of more diverse AMF communities. Our analysis also showed that the genetic makeup of the host plant structured root-inhabiting AMF communities, suggesting that the plant genetic makeup may be linked to genes that control symbiosis development.",

We demonstrate the use of slimr with an example from our own work on the landscape population genomics of desert mammals, highlighting the advantage of having a single integrated tool for both data analysis and simulation. slimr makes the powerful simulation ability of SliM 3.0 directly accessible to R users, allowing integrated simulation projects that incorporate empirical data without the need to switch between software environments.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe diversity of biological and ecological characteristics of organisms, and the underlying genetic patterns and processes of speciation, makes the development of universally applicable genetic species delimitation methods challenging. Many approaches, like those incorporating the multispecies coalescent, sometimes delimit populations and overestimate species numbers. This issue is exacerbated in taxa with inherently high population structure due to low dispersal ability, and in cryptic species resulting from nonecological speciation. These taxa present a conundrum when delimiting species: analyses rely heavily, if not entirely, on genetic data which over split species, while other lines of evidence lump. We showcase this conundrum in the harvester Theromaster brunneus, a low dispersal taxon with a wide geographic distribution and high potential for cryptic species. Integrating morphology, mitochondrial, and sub-genomic (double-digest RADSeq and ultraconserved elements) data, we find high discordance across analyses and data types in the number of inferred species, with further evidence that multispecies coalescent approaches over split. We demonstrate the power of a supervised machine learning approach in effectively delimiting cryptic species by creating a \"custom\" training dataset derived from a well-studied lineage with similar biological characteristics as Theromaster. This novel approach uses known taxa with particular biological characteristics to inform unknown taxa with similar characteristics, and uses modern computational tools ideally suited for species delimitation while also considering the biology and natural history of organisms to make more biologically informed species delimitation decisions. In principle, this approach is universally applicable for species delimitation of any taxon with genetic data, particularly for cryptic species.",

However, little is known empirically in cichlids about the genetic mechanisms generating new sex-determining variants, what forces dictate their fate, the demographic scales at which they evolve, and whether they are related to speciation. To address these questions, we looked for sex-associated loci in full genome data from 647 individuals of Astatotilapia calliptera from Lake Masoko, a small isolated crater lake in Tanzania, which contains two distinct ecomorphs of the species. We identified three separate XY systems on recombining chromosomes. Two Y alleles derive from mutations that increase expression of the gonadal soma-derived factor gene (gsdf) on chromosome 7; the first is a tandem duplication of the entire gene observed throughout much of the Lake Malawi haplochromine cichlid radiation to which A. calliptera belongs, and the second is a 5 kb insertion directly upstream of gsdf. Both the latter variant and another 700 bp insertion on chromosome 19 responsible for the third Y allele arose from transposable element insertions. Males belonging to the Masoko deep-water benthic ecomorph are determined exclusively by the gsdf duplication, whereas all three Y alleles are used in the Masoko littoral ecomorph, in which they appear to act antagonistically among males with different amounts of benthic admixture. This antagonism in the face of ongoing admixture may be important for sustaining multifactorial sex determination in Lake Masoko. In addition to identifying the molecular basis of three coexisting sex determining alleles, these results demonstrate that genetic interactions between Y alleles and genetic background can potentially affect fitness and adaptive evolution.",

The picture was then refined by Cressman (1990) introducing the strong stability concept which says that if there is a monomorphic ESS then stable polymorphism is established in polymorphic populations.

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic genes are interrupted by introns that must be accurately spliced from mRNA precursors. With an average length of 25 nt, the >90,000 introns of Paramecium tetraurelia stand among the shortest introns reported in eukaryotes. The mechanisms specifying the correct recognition of these tiny introns remain poorly understood. Splicing can occur co-transcriptionally and it has been proposed that chromatin structure might influence splice site recognition. To investigate the roles of nucleosome positioning in intron recognition, we determined the nucleosome occupancy along the P. tetraurelia genome. We showed that P. tetraurelia displays a regular nucleosome array with a nucleosome repeat length of [~]151 bp, amongst the smallest periodicities reported. Our analysis revealed that introns are frequently associated with inter-nucleosomal DNA, pointing to an evolutionary constraint to locate introns at the AT-rich nucleosome edge sequences. Using accurate splicing efficiency data from cells depleted for the nonsense-mediated decay effectors, we showed that introns located at the edge of nucleosomes display higher splicing efficiency than those at the centre. However, multiple regression analysis indicated that the GC content, rather than nucleosome positioning, directly contributes to intron splicing efficiency. Our data reveal a complex link between GC content, nucleosome positioning and intron evolution in Paramecium.",

Because all CoVs use -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to control expression of key viral proteins, the frameshift signal in viral mRNA that stimulates -1 PRF provides a promising potential target for such therapeutics. To test the viability of this strategy, we explored a group of 6 small-molecule ligands, evaluating their activity against the frameshift signals from a panel of representative bat CoVs--the most likely source of future zoonoses--as well as SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. We found that whereas some ligands had notable activity against only a few of the frameshift signals, the serine protease inhibitor nafamostat suppressed -1 PRF significantly in several of them, while having limited to no effect on -1 PRF caused by frameshift signals from other viruses used as negative controls. These results suggest it is possible to find small-molecule ligands that inhibit -1 PRF specifically in a broad spectrum of CoVs, establishing the frameshift signal as a viable target for developing pan-coronaviral therapeutics.",

Then, gene enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network construction, and topological analysis were performed on the DEGs by the Gene Ontology (GO), REACTOME pathway, STRING, HiPPIE, miRNet, NetworkAnalyst and Cytoscape. Finally, we performed receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis of hub genes. A total of 930 DEGs 9464 up regulated genes and 466 down regulated genes) were identified in HF. GO and REACTOME pathway enrichment results showed that DEGs mainly enriched in localization, small molecule metabolic process, SARS-CoV infections and the citric acid (TCA) cycle and respiratory electron transport. Subsequently, the PPI network, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network were constructed, and 10 hub genes in these network were focused on by centrality analysis and module analysis. Furthermore, data showed that HSP90AA1, ARRB2, MYH9, HSP90AB1, FLNA, EGFR, PIK3R1, CUL4A, YEATS4 and KAT2B were good diagnostic values. In summary, this study suggests that HSP90AA1, ARRB2, MYH9, HSP90AB1, FLNA, EGFR, PIK3R1, CUL4A, YEATS4 and KAT2B may act as the key genes in HF.",

The RBDA transition from Down to one-Up is supported by transient salt-bridges between RBDA and RBDC and by the glycan at N343B.

This process has been previously explored using synthetically engineered heterogenous multicell spheroid systems, in which cell subpopulations engage in bidirectional intercellular signaling to regulate the expression of different cadherins. While engineered cell systems provide excellent experimental tools to observe pattern formation in cell populations, computational models may be leveraged to more systematically explore the key parameters that drive the emergence of different patterns. We developed and validated two- and three-dimensional agent-based models (ABMs) of spheroid patterning for cells engineered with a bidirectional signaling circuit that regulates N- and P-cadherin expression. The model was used to predict how varying initial cell seedings, cadherin induction probabilities, or homotypic adhesion strengths between cells impact spheroid patterning, and unsupervised machine learning techniques were used to map system parameters to unique spheroid patterns. The model was then deployed to design new synthetic cell signaling circuits based on a desired final multicell pattern.",

    "abstract": "Like many insect species, Drosophila melanogaster are capable of maintaining a stable flight trajectory for periods lasting up to several hours(1, 2). Because aerodynamic torque is roughly proportional to the fifth power of wing length(3), even small asymmetries in wing size require the maintenance of subtle bilateral differences in flapping motion to maintain a stable path. Flies can even fly straight after losing half of a wing, a feat they accomplish via very large, sustained kinematic changes to the both damaged and intact wings(4). Thus, the neural network responsible for stable flight must be capable of sustaining fine-scaled control over wing motion across a large dynamic range. In this paper, we describe an unusual type of descending neurons (DNg02) that project directly from visual output regions of the brain to the dorsal flight neuropil of the ventral nerve cord. Unlike most descending neurons, which exist as single bilateral pairs with unique morphology, there is a population of at least 15 DNg02 cell pairs with nearly identical shape. By optogenetically activating different numbers of DNg02 cells, we demonstrate that these neurons regulate wingbeat amplitude over a wide dynamic range via a population code. Using 2-photon functional imaging, we show that DNg02 cells are responsive to visual motion during flight in a manner that would make them well suited to continuously regulate bilateral changes in wing kinematics. Collectively, we have identified a critical set of DNs that provide the sensitivity and dynamic range required for flight control.",

    "abstract": "In a competitive game involving an animal and an opponent, the outcome is contingent on the choices of both players. To succeed, the animal must continually adapt to competitive pressure, or else risk being exploited and lose out on rewards. In this study, we demonstrate that head-fixed mice can be trained to play the iterative competitive game  matching pennies against a virtual computer opponent. We find that the animals performance is well described by a hybrid computational model that includes Q-learning and choice kernels. Comparing between matching pennies and a non-competitive two-armed bandit task, we show that the tasks encourage animals to operate at different regimes of reinforcement learning. To understand the involvement of neuromodulatory mechanisms, we measure fluctuations in pupil size and use multiple linear regression to relate the trial-by-trial transient pupil responses to decision-related variables. The analysis reveals that pupil responses are modulated by observable variables, including choice and outcome, as well as latent variables for value updating, but not action selection. Collectively, these results establish a paradigm for studying competitive decision-making in head-fixed mice and provide insights into the role of arousal-linked neuromodulation in the decision process.",

    "abstract": "We combine a chemically-synthesized, voltage-sensitive fluorophore with a genetically encoded, self-labeling enzyme to enable voltage imaging in Drosophila melanogaster. Previously, we showed that a rhodamine voltage reporter (RhoVR) combined with the HaloTag self-labeling enzyme could be used to monitor membrane potential changes from mammalian neurons in culture and brain slice. Here, we apply this hybrid RhoVR-Halo approach in vivo to achieve selective neuron labeling in intact fly brains. We generate a Drosophila UAS-HaloTag reporter line in which the HaloTag enzyme is expressed on the surface of cells. We validate the voltage sensitivity of this new construct in cell culture before driving expression of HaloTag in specific brain neurons in flies. We show that selective labeling of synapses, cells, and brain regions can be achieved with RhoVR-Halo in either larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) or in whole adult brains. Finally, we validate the voltage sensitivity of RhoVR-Halo in fly tissue via dual-electrode/imaging at the NMJ, show the efficacy of this approach for measuring synaptic excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) in muscle cells, and perform voltage imaging of carbachol-evoked depolarization and osmolarity-evoked hyperpolarization in projection neurons and in interoceptive subesophageal zone neurons in fly brain explants following in vivo labeling. We envision the turn-on response to depolarizations, fast response kinetics, and two-photon compatibility of chemical indicators, coupled with the cellular and synaptic specificity of genetically-encoded enzymes, will make RhoVR-Halo a powerful complement to neurobiological imaging in Drosophila.\n\nSignificance StatementVoltage imaging is a powerful method for interrogating neurobiology. Chemical indicators possess fast response kinetics, turn-on responses to membrane depolarization, and can be compatible with two-photon excitation. However, selective cell labeling in intact tissues and in vivo remains a challenge for completely synthetic fluorophores. Here, we show that a chemical - genetic hybrid approach in Drosophila enables cell-specific staining in vivo and voltage imaging in whole-brain explants and at neuromuscular junction synapses.",

These perceptual expectations, or predictions, come from our knowledge of the context, however its unclear how memory and perceptual systems interact to support the prediction and reactivation of sensory details in cortex. To address this, human participants learned the spatial layout of animals positioned in a cross maze. During fMRI, participants navigated between animals to reach a target, and in the process saw a predictable sequence of five animal images. Critically, to isolate activity patterns related to item predictions, rather than bottom-up inputs, one quarter of trials ended early, with a blank screen presented instead. Using multivariate pattern similarity analysis, we reveal that activity patterns in early visual cortex, posterior medial regions, and the posterior hippocampus showed greater similarity when seeing the same item compared to different items. Further, item effects in posterior hippocampus were specific to the sequence context. Critically, activity patterns associated with seeing an item in visual cortex and posterior medial cortex, were also related to activity patterns when an item was expected, but omitted, suggesting sequence predictions were reinstated in these regions. Finally, multivariate connectivity showed that patterns in the posterior hippocampus at one position in the sequence were related to patterns in early visual cortex and posterior medial cortex at a later position. Together, our results support the idea that hippocampal representations facilitate sensory processing by modulating visual cortical activity in anticipation of expected items.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate development from an egg to a complex multi-tissue million-cell organism is supported by multiple phases of genome-scale remodeling of the repertoire of proteins and their post-translational modifications, yet so far we know little about these phases. In this paper we present comprehensive characterization of these processes reflected by eleven time points, approximately eleven thousand proteins, and six thousand phospho-forms in two replicates. We find that the most dramatic changes to the proteome occur during the transition to functional organ systems, which occurs as the embryo becomes a tadpole. At that time the absolute amount of non-yolk protein increases two-fold, and there is a shift in the balance of expression from proteins regulating gene expression to receptors, ligands, and proteins involved in cell-cell and cell-environment interactions. Between the early and late tadpole, the median increase of membrane and secreted proteins is substantially higher than that of nuclear proteins. For the first time, we have included quantitative phospho-proteomic data across the same developmental stages. In contrast to the significant protein changes that are concentrated at the end of the time series, the most significant phosphorylation changes are concentrated in the very early stages of development. A clear exception are phosphorylations of proteins involved in gene expression; these increase just after fertilization, with patterns that are highly correlated with the underlying protein changes. To improve our interpretation of this unique data set, we created a pipeline for identifying homologous human phosphorylations from the measured Xenopus phospho-proteome, and we estimated, where possible, the occupancy of phosphorylation sites. Overall, we detected many profound temporal transitions, which suggest concerted changes in developmental strategies in the embryo that are particularly pronounced once early patterning and specification are complete.",

    "abstract": "Advances in artificial intelligence for computer vision hold great promise for increasing the scales at which ecological systems can be studied. The distribution and behavior of individuals is central to ecology, and computer vision using deep neural networks can learn to detect individual objects in imagery. However, developing supervised models for ecological monitoring is challenging because it needs large amounts of human-labeled training data, requires advanced technical expertise and computational infrastructure, and is prone to overfitting. This limits application across space and time. One solution is developing generalized models that can be applied across species and ecosystems. Using over 250,000 annotations from 13 projects from around the world, we develop a general bird detection model that achieves over 65% recall and 50% precision on novel aerial data without any local training despite differences in species, habitat, and imaging methodology. Fine-tuning this model with only 1000 local annotations increase these values to an average of 84% recall and 69% precision by building on the general features learned from other data sources. Retraining from the general model improves local predictions even when moderately large annotation sets are available and makes model training faster and more stable. Our results demonstrate that general models for detecting broad classes of organisms using airborne imagery are achievable. These models can reduce the effort, expertise, and computational resources necessary for automating the detection of individual organisms across large scales, helping to transform the scale of data collection in ecology and the questions that can be addressed.",

    "abstract": "Human-driven translocations of species have diverse evolutionary consequences such as promoting hybridization between previously geographically isolated taxa. This is well-illustrated by the solitary tunicate, Ciona robusta, native to the North East Pacific and introduced in the North East Atlantic. It is now co-occurring with its congener C. intestinalis in the English Channel, and C. roulei in the Mediterranean Sea. Despite their long allopatric divergence, first and second generation crosses showed a high hybridization success between the introduced and native taxa in the laboratory. However, previous genetic studies failed to provide evidence of recent hybridization between C. robusta and C. intestinalis in the wild. Using SNPs obtained from ddRAD-sequencing of 397 individuals from 26 populations, we further explored the genome-wide population structure of the native Ciona taxa. We first confirmed results documented in previous studies, notably i) a chaotic genetic structure at regional scale, and ii) a high genetic similarity between C. roulei and C. intestinalis, which is calling for further taxonomic investigation. More importantly, and unexpectedly, we also observed a genomic hotspot of long introgressed C. robusta tracts into C. intestinalis genomes at several locations of their contact zone. Both the genomic architecture of introgression, restricted to a 1.5 Mb region of chromosome 5, and its absence in allopatric populations suggest introgression is recent and occurred after the introduction of the non-indigenous species. Overall, our study shows that anthropogenic hybridization can be effective in promoting introgression breakthroughs between species at a late stage of the speciation continuum.",

As a model, we used dioecious plants from the section Otites of the genus Silene. We have observed a rise in adaptive evolution in the autosomal and pseudoautosomal parts of the genome, which are associated with the evolution of dioecy. This rise is caused neither by the accumulation of sexually antagonistic genes in the pseudoautosomal region nor by the co-evolution of genes acting in mitochondria (in spite of the fact that the dioecy evolved in this case most likely from cytoplasmic male sterility). Thus, this rise in the amount of positively selected codons is most likely caused by the adaptive evolution of genes involved in the specialization of the autosomal part of the genome on the dioecy as described in sex-allocation theory.",

There are several approaches using alignment-based or alignment-free methods to analyze similarities/dissimilarities between DNA sequences. In this work, we introduce a novel representation of DNA sequences, using n-ary Cartesian products of graphs for arbitrary positive integers n. Each of the component graphs in the representing Cartesian product of each DNA sequence contain combinatorial information of certain tuples of nucleotides appearing in the DNA sequence. We further introduce a metric space structure to the set of all Cartesian products of graphs that represent a given collection of DNA sequences in order to be able to compare different Cartesian products of graphs, which in turn signifies similarities/dissimilarities between DNA sequences. We test our proposed method on several datasets including Human Papillomavirus, Human rhinovirus, Influenza A virus, and Mammals. We compare our method to other methods in literature, which indicates that our analysis results are comparable in terms of time complexity and high accuracy, and in one dataset, our method performs the best in comparison with other methods.",

    "abstract": "Complex branched salivary structures remain challenging to replicate within implant ready hydrogels. We showed previously that hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogels enable growth and organization of primary salivary-derived human stem/progenitor cells (hS/PCs) into multicellular spheroids. Here, we systematically functionalized three components of migration-permissive hydrogels to foster salivary tissue morphogenesis. We separately analyzed contributions of an enzymatically degradable crosslinker, a pendant integrin-binding site, and hydrogel porosity to best support high viability, integrin-dependent cell adhesion and migration. Structure size, frequency, and morphology were all affected by hydrogel crosslink density and integration of biofunctional peptides. Viability and proliferation data suggested that integration of integrin binding sites had the greatest effect on hS/PCs behavior. A larger internal matrix space, created by increasing both crosslinker length and PEG content, was needed to form large multicellular hS/PC structures. Peptide-modified hydrogels with more internal space shifted hS/PC organization from spheroidal, surrounded by thick basement membrane, to an asymmetric arrangement with punctate matrix proteins defining a \"wrinkled\" perimeter. Integrin-binding peptides activated integrin {beta}1, with highest activation observed in hydrogels having both cleavable peptide and integrin ligand. The design parameters we prescribe allowed us to encapsulate hS/PCs in a humanized biomimetic hydrogel matrix able to support morphogenesis needed for salivary restoration.",

Although coherent retinal imaging is well established by optical coherence tomography, it is still a large void for incoherent volumetric imaging in the human retina. Here, we report confocal oblique scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (CoSLO), to fill that void and harness incoherent optical contrast in 3D. CoSLO uses oblique scanning laser and remote focusing to acquire depth signal in parallel, avoid the lengthy z-stacking, and image a large field of view (FOV). In addition, confocal gating is introduced by a linear sensor array to improve the contrast and resolution. For the first time, we achieved incoherent 3D human retinal imaging with >20{degrees} viewing angle within only 5 seconds. The depth resolution is [~]45 microns in vivo. We demonstrated label-free incoherent contrast by CoSLO, revealing unique features in the retina. CoSLO will be an important technique for clinical care of retinal conditions and fundamental vision science, by offering unique volumetric incoherent contrasts.",

    "abstract": "Scar tissue formation is a result of excess healing reactions after wounding. Hypertrophic scars scarcely develop in a mouse. In the present study, we established a novel experimental model of a scar-forming wound by resecting a small portion of the abdominal wall on the lower center of the abdomen, which exposed contractive forces by the surrounding muscle tissue. As a tension-less control, a back-skin excision model was used with a splint fixed onto the excised skin edge, and granulation tissue formed on the muscle facia supported by the back skeleton. One week after the resection, initial healing reactions such as fibroblast proliferation took place in both models.\n\nHowever, after 21 days, lesions with collagen-rich granulation tissues forming multiple nodular/spherical-like structures developed only in the abdominal-wall model. The lesions are analogous to scar lesions in humans. Such lesions, however, did not develop in the back-skin excision model. Therefore, this animal model is unique in that fibrous scar tissues form under a physiological condition without using any artificial factors and is valuable for studying the pathogenesis and preclinical treatment of scar lesions.\n\nSummary StatementScar lesions are hardly developed in animals. We thus developed a scar lesion in mice without using any artificial factors. The model is reliable, reproducible, and valuable.",

    "abstract": "Naked mole-rats (NMR) and Damaraland mole-rats (DMR) are the only two eusocial mammals known. Both species exhibit extraordinary longevity for their body size, high tolerance to hypoxia and oxidative stress and high reproductive output; these collectively defy the concept that all life-history traits should be negatively correlated. However, when life-history traits share similar underpinning physiological mechanisms, these may be positively associated with each other. Here, we propose that the bioenergetic properties of mole-rats share a potential common mechanism. We adopted a top-down perspective measuring the bioenergetic properties at the organismal, cellular, and molecular level in both species and the biological significance of these properties were compared with the same measures in Siberian hamsters and C57BL/6 mice, chosen for their similar body size to the mole-rat species. We found mole-rats shared several bioenergetic properties that differed from their comparator species, including low basal metabolic rates, a high dependence on glycolysis rather than on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production, and low proton conductance across the mitochondrial inner membrane. These shared mole-rat features could be a result of evolutionary adaptation to tolerating variable oxygen atmospheres, in particular hypoxia, and may in turn be one of the molecular mechanisms underlying their extremely long lifespans.",

The molecules that guide these divisions include several \"polarity proteins\" that are localized to discrete plasma membrane domains, are differentially inherited during asymmetric divisions, and whose scaffolding activities can guide division plane orientation and subsequent cell fates. In the stomatal lineages on the surfaces of plant leaves, asymmetric and oriented divisions create distinct cell types in physiologically optimized patterns. The polarity protein BASL is a major regulator of stomatal lineage division and cell fate asymmetries in Arabidopsis, but its role in the stomatal lineages of other plants is unclear. Here, using phylogenetic and functional assays, we demonstrate that BASL is a eudicot-specific polarity protein. Among dicots, divergence in BASLs roles may reflect some intrinsic protein differences, but more likely reflects previously unappreciated differences in how asymmetric cell divisions are employed for pattern formation in different species. This multi-species analysis therefore provides insight into the evolution of a unique polarity regulator and into the developmental choices available to cells as they build and pattern tissues.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIBASL is a eudicot-specific regulator of stomatal lineage asymmetric cell divisions\nC_LIO_LIBASL protein evolution includes stepwise addition of polarity domains to an ancestral MAPK-binding chassis\nC_LIO_LICellular quiescence and BASL-guided polarity generate proper stomatal spacing in tomato\nC_LIO_LICell size and fate asymmetries are uncoupled in the tomato stomatal lineage\nC_LI",

These facultative peptidergic cell types are common, but it remains uncertain whether obligate peptidergic neurons exist. Our fluorescence in situ hybridization, genetically-targeted electron microscopy, and electrophysiological characterization data strongly suggest that neurons of the non-cholinergic, centrally-projecting Edinger-Westphal nucleus in mice are fundamentally obligately peptidergic. We further show, using fiber photometry, monosynaptic retrograde tracing, anterograde projection mapping, and a battery of behavioral assays, that this peptidergic population both promotes fear responses and analgesia and activates in response to loss of motor control and pain. Together, these findings elucidate an integrative, ethologically relevant function for the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and functionally align the nucleus with the periaqueductal gray, where it resides.

We used pharmacological and genetic tools for a side-by-side characterization of cold-sensitive (CS) neurons in adult mouse trigeminal (TG) and vagal ganglia (VG).\n\nWe found that CS neurons are more abundant in VG than in TG. In both ganglia, sensitivity to cold varied widely and was enhanced by the potassium channel blocker 4-AP. The majority of CS neurons in VG co-express TRPA1 markers and cold-evoked responses are severely blunted in Trpa1 KO mice, with little impact of TRPM8 deletion or pharmacological TRPM8 blockade. Consistent with these findings, the expression of TRPM8-positive neurons was low in VG and restricted to the rostral jugular ganglion. In vivo retrograde labelling of airway-innervating vagal neurons demonstrated their enhanced cold sensitivity and a higher expression of TRPA1 compared to neurons innervating the stomach wall. In contrast, the majority of CS TG neurons co-express TRPM8 markers and their cold sensitivity is reduced after TRPM8 deletion or blockade. However, pharmacological or genetic reduction of TRPA1 showed that these channels contribute significantly to their cold sensitivity in TG.

Using a diverse odor panel, we found that ensemble activities both during ( ON response) and after stimulus presentations ( OFF response) could be linearly mapped onto overall appetitive preference indices. Although diverse, ON and OFF response patterns generated by innately appetitive odorants were still limited to a low-dimensional subspace (a  neural manifold). Similarly, innately non-appetitive odorants evoked responses that were separable yet confined to another neural manifold. Notably, only odorants that evoked neural response excursions in the appetitive manifold were conducive for learning. In sum, these results provide insights on how encoding for innate preferences can also set limits on associative learning.",

Here we define the phagocytic program induced in microglia in response to IL-33. We find that IL-33 markedly alters the microglial enhancer landscape and exposes AP-1 transcription factor sites that promote target gene expression. We identify the scavenger receptor MARCO and the pattern recognition receptor TLR2 as downstream mediators of IL-33 dependent synapse engulfment. Conditional deletion of IL-33 in the CNS or its receptor on microglia results in increased numbers of excitatory synapses in the corticothalamic circuit and spontaneous epileptiform activity as well as increased seizure susceptibility by early adulthood.

The importance of each attribute together with its quality will determine our preference rankings over the available alternatives. Here, we test the hypothesis that the most prominent class of model for simple decisions - sequential sampling or evidence accumulation to bound - can be bolstered by explicitly incorporating variables related to individual attributes in addition to the standard usage of overall value estimates. We examine six datasets in which participants evaluated snack foods both in terms of overall value and individual attributes, then chose between pairs of the same snacks, and show that only models that explicitly incorporate information about the individual attributes are able to reproduce fundamental patterns in the choice data, such as the influence of attribute disparity on decisions, and such models provide quantitatively better fits to the choice outcomes, response times, and confidence ratings compared to models based on overall value alone.

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has underscored the need for rapidly employable prophylactic and antiviral treatments against emerging viruses. Nucleic acid agonists of the innate immune system can be administered to activate an effective antiviral program for prophylaxis in exposed populations, a measure of particular relevance for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to its efficient evasion of the host antiviral response. In this study, we utilized the K18-hACE2 mouse model of COVID-19 to examine whether prophylactic activation of the antiviral receptor RIG-I protects mice from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Systemic treatment of mice with a specific RIG-I ligand one to seven days prior to infection with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2 improved their survival of by up to 50 %. Improved survival was associated with lower viral load in oropharyngeal swabs and in the lungs and brain of RIG-I-treated mice. Moreover, despite antiviral protection, the surviving mice that were treated with RIG-I ligand developed adaptive SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. These results reveal that prophylactic RIG-I activation by synthetic RNA oligonucleotides is a promising strategy to convey short-term, unspecific antiviral protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and may be a suitable broad-spectrum approach to constraining the spread of newly emerging viruses until virus-specific therapies and vaccines become available.",

    "abstract": "Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience lifelong respiratory infections which are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. These infections are polymicrobial in nature, and the predominant bacterial species undergo a predictable series of changes as patients age. Young patients have populations dominated by opportunists that are typically found within the microbiome of the human nasopharynx, such as nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi); these are eventually supplanted and the population within the CF lung is later dominated by pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa). In this study, we investigated how initial colonization with NTHi impacts colonization and persistence of Pa in the respiratory tract.\n\nAnalysis of polymicrobial biofilms in vitro by confocal microscopy revealed that NTHi promoted greater levels of Pa biofilm volume and diffusion. However, sequential respiratory infection of mice with NTHi followed by Pa resulted in significantly lower Pa as compared to infection with Pa alone. Coinfected mice also had reduced airway tissue damage and lower levels of inflammatory cytokines as compared with Pa infected mice. Similar results were observed after instillation of heat-inactivated NTHi bacteria or purified NTHi lipooligosaccharide (LOS) endotoxin prior to Pa introduction. Based on these results, we conclude that NTHi significantly reduces susceptibility to subsequent Pa infection, most likely due to priming of host innate immunity rather than a direct competitive interaction between species. These findings have potential significance with regard to therapeutic management of early life infections in patients with CF.",

    "abstract": "DNA repair systems allow microbes to survive in diverse environments that compromise chromosomal integrity. Pathogens such as M. tuberculosis must contend with the genotoxic host environment, which generates the mutations that underlie antibiotic resistance. Mycobacteria encode the widely distributed SOS pathway, governed by the LexA repressor, but also encode PafBC, a positive regulator of the transcriptional DNA damage response (DDR). Although the transcriptional outputs of these systems have been characterized, their full functional division of labor in survival and mutagenesis is unknown. Here we specifically ablate the PafBC or SOS pathways, alone and in combination, and test their relative contributions to repair. We find that SOS and PafBC have both distinct and overlapping roles that depend on the type of DNA damage. Most notably, we find that quinolone antibiotics and replication fork perturbation are inducers of the PafBC pathway, and that chromosomal mutagenesis is codependent on PafBC and SOS, through shared regulation of the DnaE2/ImuA/B mutasome. These studies define the complex transcriptional regulatory network of the DDR in mycobacteria and provide new insight into the regulatory mechanisms controlling the genesis of antibiotic resistance in M. tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the potential use and quantitation of human enteric viruses in municipal wastewater samples of Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada) as alternative indicators of contamination and evaluated the processing stages of the wastewater treatment plant. During the fall 2019 and winter 2020 seasons, samples of raw sewage, activated sludge, effluents, and biosolids (sludge cake) were collected from the North End Sewage Treatment Plant (NESTP), which is the largest wastewater treatment plant in the City of Winnipeg. DNA and RNA enteric viruses, as well as the uidA gene found in Escherichia coli were targeted in the samples collected from the NESTP. Total nucleic acids from each wastewater treatment sample were extracted using a commercial spin-column kit. Enteric viruses were quantitated in the extracted samples via quantitative PCR using TaqMan assays.\n\nThe average gene copies assessed in the raw sewage were not significantly different (p-values ranged between 0.0547 and 0.7986) than the average gene copies assessed in the effluents for Adenovirus and crAssphage (DNA viruses), Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (RNA virus), and uidA in terms of both volume and biomass. A significant reduction of these enteric viruses was observed consistently in activated sludge samples compared with those for raw sewage. Corresponding reductions in gene copies per volume and gene copies per biomass were also seen for uidA but were not statistically significant (p-value = 0.8769 and p-value = 0.6353, respectively). The higher gene copy numbers of enteric viruses and E. coli observed in the effluents may be associated with the 12-hour hydraulic retention time in the facility. Enteric viruses found in gene copy numbers were at least one order of magnitude higher than the E. coli marker uidA. This indicate that enteric viruses may survive the wastewater treatment process and viral-like particles are being released into the aquatic environment. Our results suggest that Adenovirus, crAssphage, and Pepper mild mottle virus can be used as complementary viral indicators of human fecal pollution.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPytoptosis is essential for tumorigenesis and progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, the heterogeneity of pyroposis and its relationship with the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to identify proptosis-related subtypes and construct a prognosis prediction model based on pyroptosis signatures.\n\nMethodsFirst, heterogenous pyroptosis subgroups were explored based on 33 pyroptosis-related genes and ccRCC samples from TCGA, and the model establsihed by LASSO regression was verified by ICGC database. Then, the clinical significance, functional status, immune infiltration, cell-cell communication, genomic alteration and drug sensitivity of different subgroups were further analyzed. Finally, the LASSO-Cox algorithm was applied to narrow down the candidate genes to develop a robust and concise prognostic model.\n\nResultsTwo heterogenous pyroptosis subgroups were identified: pyroptosis-low immunity-low C1 subtype, and pyroptosis-high immunity-high C2 subtype. Compared with C1, C2 was associated with a higher clinical stage or grade and a worse prognosis. More immune cell infiltration was observed in C2 than that in C1, while the response rate in C2 subgroup was lower than that in C1 subgroup. Pyroptosis related genes were mainly expressed in myeloid cells, and T cells and epithelial cells might influence other cell clusters via Pyroptosis related pathway. In addition, C1 was characterized by MTOR and ATM mutation, while C2 was characterized by more significant alterations in SPEN and ROS1 mutation. Finally, we constructed and validated a robust and promising signature based on the pyroptosis-related risk score for assessing the prognosis in ccRCC.\n\nConclusionWe identified two heterogeneous pyroptosis subtypes and 5 reliable risk signatures to establish a prognosis prediction model. Our findings may help better understand the role of pyroptosis in ccRCC progression and provide a new perspective in the management of ccRCC patients.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms communicating changes in tissue stiffness and size are particularly relevant in the intestine, because it is subject to constant mechanical stresses caused by peristalsis of its variable content. Using the Drosophila intestinal epithelium, we investigate the role of vinculin, one of the best characterised mechanoeffectors, which functions in both cadherin and integrin adhesion complexes. We discovered that vinculin regulates cell fate decisions, by preventing precocious activation and differentiation of intestinal progenitors into absorptive cells. It achieves this in concert with -catenin at sites of cadherin adhesion, rather than as part of integrin function. Following asymmetric division of the stem cell into a stem cell and an enteroblast, the two cells initially remain connected by adherens junctions, where vinculin is required, only on the enteroblast side, to maintain the enteroblast in a quiescent state and inhibit further divisions of the stem cell. Removing vinculin increases enteroblast differentiation and numbers, resulting in an enlarged gut with improved ability to recover after starvation. Thus, mechanical regulation at the contact between stem cells and their progeny is used to control tissue cell number.",

    "abstract": "Bees are presumed to have arisen in the early to mid-Cretaceous coincident with the fragmentation of the southern continents and concurrently with the early diversification of the flowering plants. Among the main groups of bees, Andreninae sensu lato comprise about 3000 species widely distributed with greatest and disjunct diversity in arid areas of North America, South America, and the Palearctic region. Here, we present the first comprehensive dated phylogeny and historical biogeographic analysis for andrenine bees, including representatives of all currently recognized tribes. Our analyses rely on a dataset of 106 taxa and 7952 aligned nucleotide positions from one mitochondrial and six nuclear loci. Andreninae is strongly supported as a monophyletic group and the recovered phylogeny corroborates the commonly recognized clades for the group. Thus, we propose a revised tribal classification that is congruent with our phylogenetic results. The time-calibrated phylogeny and ancestral range reconstructions of Andreninae reveal a fascinating evolutionary history with Gondwana patterns that are unlike those observed in other subfamilies of bees. Andreninae arose in South America during the Late Cretaceous around 90 Million years ago (Ma) and the origin of tribes occurred through a relatively long time-window from this age to the Miocene. The early evolution of the main lineages took place in South America until the beginning of Paleocene with North American fauna origin from it and Palearctic from North America as results of multiple lineage interchanges between these areas by long-distance dispersal or hopping through landmass chains. Overall, our analyses provide strong evidence of amphitropical distributional pattern currently observed in Andreninae in the American continent as result at least three periods of possible land connections between the two American landmasses, much prior to the Panama Isthmus closure. The andrenine lineages reached the Palearctic region through four dispersal events from North America during the Eocene, late Oligocene and early Miocene, most probably via the Thulean Bridge. The few lineages with Afrotropical distribution likely originated from a Palearctic ancestral in the Miocene around 10 Ma when these regions were contiguous, and the Sahara Desert was mostly vegetated making feasible the passage by several organisms. Incursions of andrenine bees to North America and then onto the Old World are chronological congruent with distinct periods when open-vegetation habitats were available for trans-continental dispersal and at the times when aridification and temperature decline offered favorable circumstances for bee diversification.",

    "abstract": "There is a high demand for the production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli for biotechnological applications but their production is still limited by their insolubility. Fusion tags have been successfully used to enhance the solubility of aggregation-prone proteins; however, smaller and more powerful tags are desired for increasing the yield and quality of target proteins. Herein, NEXT tag, a 53 amino acid-length solubility enhancer, is described. The NEXT tag showed outstanding ability to improve both in vivo and in vitro solubilities with minimal effect on passenger proteins. The C-terminal region of the tag was mostly responsible for in vitro solubility, while the N-terminal region was essential for in vivo soluble expression. The NEXT tag appeared to be intrinsically disordered and seemed to exclude neighboring molecules and prevent protein aggregation by acting as an entropic bristle. This novel peptide tag should have general use as a fusion partner to increase the yield and quality of difficult-to-express proteins.\n\nIMPORTANCEProduction of recombinant protein in Escherichia coli still suffers from the insolubility problem. Conventional solubility enhancers with large sizes represented by maltose-binding protein (MBP) have remained as the first-choice tags, however, the success in the soluble expression of tagged protein is largely unpredictable. In addition, the large tags can negatively affect the function of target proteins. In this work, NEXT tag, an intrinsically disordered peptide, was introduced as a small but powerful alternative to MBP. The NEXT tag could significantly improve both expression level and solubility of target proteins including a thermostable carbonic anhydrase and a polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-degrading enzyme that are remarkable enzymes for environmental bioremediation.",

Though many computational approaches exist that can predict the DNA interacting residues from the protein sequences, there is still a significant opportunity for improvement in terms of performance and accessibility. In this study, we have downloaded the benchmark dataset from method hybridNAP and recently published method ProNA2020, for training and validation purposes, that comprise 864 and 308 proteins, respectively. We have implemented CD-HIT software to handle the redundancy with 30% identity, and left with 646 proteins for training and 46 proteins for validation purposes, in which the validation dataset do not share more than 30% of sequence identity with the training dataset. We have generated amino acid binary profiles, physicochemical-properties based binary profiles, PSSM profiles, and a combination of all profiles described as hybrid feature. 1D-CNN based model performed best as compared to other models for each set of features. The model developed using amino acid binary profile achieved AUROC of 0.83 and 0.74 for training and validation dataset. Using physicochemical properties based binary profile, model attained AUROC of 0.86 and 0.73 for training and validation dataset.

    "abstract": "Microglial cells are the first line of defense within the central nervous system, with morphological characterization being widely used to define their activation status. Most methods to evaluate microglia status are manual, and, therefore, often biased, inaccurate, and time consuming. In fact, the process to collect morphological data starts with the acquisition of photomicrographs from where images of single cells are extracted. Then, the researcher collects the morphological features that characterize each cell. However, a manual data collection process from single cells can take weeks to complete. This work describes an open-source ImageJ plugin, MorphData, which automatizes the data extraction process of morphological features of single microglial cells. The plugin collects, processes, and organizes features associated with cell complexity and ramification. In a computer with limited computing power, MorphData was able to handle 699 single cells in less than 14 minutes. The same process, if performed manually, would take almost 19 working days. Overall, MorphData significantly reduces the time taken to collect morphological data from microglial cells, which can then be used to study, understand, and characterize microglia behavior in the brain of human patients or of animal models of neurological and psychiatric diseases.",

    "abstract": "Reciprocally inhibitory modules that form half-center oscillators require mechanisms for escaping or being released from inhibition. The central pattern generator (CPG) underlying swimming by the nudibranch mollusc, Dendronotus iris, is composed of only four neurons that are organized into two competing modules of a half center oscillator. In this system, bursting activity in left-right alternation is not driven by any of the neurons but is an emergent property of the network as a whole. We found that the unique synaptic actions and membrane properties of the two neurons in each module (Si2 and Si3) play complementary roles in generating stable bursting in this network oscillator. Only Si2 evokes fast and strong inhibition of its contralateral counterpart, the termination of which initiates post-inhibitory rebound in the Si3 of that module. Only Si3 is responsible for the rebound excitation because it has a hyperpolarization-activated inward current. Within each module, the synaptic actions and membrane properties of the two neurons complement each other: Si3 excites Si2, which then feeds back slow inhibition to Si3, terminating the burst. Using dynamic clamp, we showed that the magnitude of the slow inhibition sets the period of the oscillator. Thus, the synaptic actions of Si2 provide the hyperpolarization needed for the other module to rebound stably, whereas the membrane properties of Si3 in each module cause it to rebound first and excite Si2 and maintain the burst until the cycle repeats and the other module becomes active.",

    "abstract": "The microvascular inflow tract (MIT), comprising the penetrating arterioles, precapillary sphincters, and first order capillaries, is the bottleneck for brain blood flow and energy supply. However, the exact structural and functional alterations of the MIT during aging remain elusive. In vivo 4-dimensional two-photon imaging showed an age-dependent decrease in vaso-responsivity, with reduced sensitivity of the MIT to pinacidil and papaverine, vasoconstrictor endothelin-1, and nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME. This was accompanied by an age-dependent decrease in capillary density close to the arterioles and loss of pericyte processes, though the number of pericyte somas and pericyte SMA density were preserved. The age-related reduction in vascular reactivity was most pronounced at precapillary sphincters, highlighting their crucial role in capillary blood flow regulation. Mathematical modeling revealed dysregulated but preserved pressure and flow in aged mice during vasoconstriction. Preventing reduced responsivity of the MIT may ameliorate the blood flow decrease associated with aging-related brain frailty.",

    "abstract": "Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is observed in many brain disorders. Obesity has been linked to ICP pathogenesis in disorders such as idiopathic intracranial pressure (IIH). We investigated the effect of diet induced obesity (DIO) on ICP and clinically relevant sequelae.\n\nRats were fed either a control or high fat diet. Following weight gain long term ICP, headache behavior, body composition and retinal outcome were examined. Post-hoc analysis of retinal histology and molecular analysis of choroid plexus and trigeminal ganglion (TG) were performed.\n\nDIO rats demonstrated raised ICP by 55% which correlated with the abdominal fat percentage and increased non-respiratory slow waves, suggestive of altered cerebral compliance. Concurrently, DIO rats demonstrated a specific cephalic cutaneous allodynia which negatively correlated with the abdominal fat percentage. This sensitivity was associated with increased expression of headache markers in TG. Additionally, DIO rats had an in vivo increased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness associated with raised ICP with a subsequent post-hoc demonstration of neuroretinal degeneration.\n\nThis study demonstrates for the first time that DIO leads to raised ICP and subsequent clinically relevant symptom development. This novel model of non-traumatic raised ICP could expand the knowledge regarding disorders with elevated ICP such as IIH.",

    "abstract": "Serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) can provide comprehensive 3D ultrastructural information of the brain with exceptional computational cost. Targeted reconstruction of subcellular structures from ssEM datasets is less computationally demanding but still highly informative. We thus developed a Region-CNN-based deep learning method to identify, segment, and reconstruct synapses and mitochondria to explore the structural plasticity of synapses and mitochondria in the auditory cortex of mice subjected to fear conditioning. Upon reconstructing over 135,000 mitochondria and 160,000 synapses, we found that fear conditioning significantly increases the number of mitochondria but decreases their size, and promotes the formation of multi-contact synapses comprising a single axonal bouton and multiple postsynaptic sites from different dendrites. Modeling indicates that such multi-contact configuration increases the information storage capacity of new synapses by over 50%. With high accuracy and speed in reconstruction, our method yields structural and functional insight into cellular plasticity associated with fear learning.",

    "abstract": "Allergic asthma is a chronic inflammatory respiratory disease associated with eosinophilic infiltration, increased mucus production, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and airway remodeling. Epidemiologic data has revealed that the prevalence of allergic sensitization and associated diseases has increased in the twentieth century. This has been hypothesized to be partly due to reduced contact with microbial organisms (the hygiene hypothesis) in industrialized society. Airway epithelial cells, once considered a static physical barrier between the body and the external world, are now widely recognized as immunologically active cells that can initiate, maintain, and restrain inflammatory responses, such as those that mediate allergic disease. Airway epithelial cells can sense allergens via myriad expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). We sought to determine whether the innate immune response stimulated by a combination of Pam2CSK4 (\"Pam2\", TLR2/6 ligand) and a class C oligodeoxynucleotide ODN362 (\"ODN\", TLR9 ligand) when delivered together by aerosol (\"Pam2ODN\"), can modulate the allergic immune response to allergens. Treatment with Pam2ODN 7 days before sensitization to House Dust Mite (HDM) extract resulted in a strong reduction in eosinophilic and lymphocytic inflammation. This Pam2ODN immunomodulatory effect was also seen using Ovalbumin (OVA) and A. oryzae (Ao) mouse models. The immunomodulatory effect was observed as much as 30 days before sensitization to HDM, but ineffective just 2 days after sensitization, suggesting that Pam2ODN immunomodulation lowers the allergic responsiveness of airway epithelial cells. Furthermore, Pam2 and ODN cooperated synergistically suggesting that this treatment is superior to any single agonist in the setting of allergen immunotherapy.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA synergistic combination of Toll-like Receptor agonists, delivered directly into the lung mucosa, can attenuate allergic responsiveness of airway epithelial cells and prevent host sensitization to aeroallergens.\n\nWhat is already knownO_LIAllergic sensitization has increased in the 20th century due to reduced contact with microbial organisms in industrialized society (ie. hygiene hypothesis)\nC_LIO_LIWe have previously identified a pharmacological means to stimulate innate immunity of lung epithelial cells.\nC_LI\n\nWhat this study addsO_LIActivation of innate immunity in lung epithelial cells attenuates the allergic responsiveness of mice.\nC_LIO_LISynergistic cooperation of pattern recognition receptors induces stronger immunomodulatory responses\nC_LI\n\nWhat is the clinical significanceO_LIAerosolized Toll-like Receptor agonists have been demonstrated as safe in human clinical trials\nC_LIO_LIThis study provides proof-of-principle that aerosolized toll-like receptor agonists could have clinical efficacy in the setting of the allergen immunotherapy\nC_LI",

Correction methods are usually based on simulations approximating biophysical chemistry, making them computationally expensive and often not correcting all clashes.\n\nResultsWe propose a computationally fast data-driven statistical method yielding suites free from within-suite clashes: From such a clash free training data set, devising mode hunting after torus PCA on adaptive cutting average linkage tree clustering (MINTAGE), we learn RNA suite shapes. With classification based on multiscale structure enhancement (CLEAN), for a given clash suite we determine its neighborhood on a mesoscopic scale involving several suites. As corrected suite we propose the Frechet mean on a torus of the largest classes in this neighborhood. We validate CLEAN MINTAGE on a benchmark data set, compare it to a state of the art correction method and apply it, as proof of concept, to two exemplary suites adjacent to helical pieces of the frameshift stimulation element of SARS-CoV-2 which are difficult to reconstruct. In contrast to a recent reconstruction proposing several different structure models, CLEAN MINTAGE unanimously proposes structure corrections within the same clash free class for all suites.\n\nCode Availabilityhttps://gitlab.gwdg.de/henrik.wiechers1/clean-mintage-code",

Methods for circRNA-specific knockout are lacking, largely due to complete sequence-overlaps between circular and cognate linear RNAs. Here, we report to use base editors (BEs) for circRNA depletion. By targeting splice sites involved in both back-splicing and canonical splicing, BEs can repress both circular and linear RNAs expression, which confirms the requirement of canonical splice site signals for back-splice. Importantly, by targeting back-splice sites predominantly for circRNA biogenesis, BEs could efficiently repress the production of circular, but not linear cognate RNAs. As hundreds of exons were found to be predominantly back-spliced to produce circRNAs, this study provides an efficient method to deplete circRNAs for function study.",

While some species disappear, other ones are beneficiated by the new conditions and some of them evolve in new adapted forms or leave their ancient distribution area.\n\nAs climate change tends to increase the temperature in several regions of the world, some species have been seen to leave areas in equatorial regions in order to join colder areas either towards the north of the northern hemisphere or towards the south of the southern one.\n\nMany birds as have moved geographically in direction to the poles and in many cases they have anticipated their laying dates. Actually, two tit species that use to lay their eggs in a period that their fledging dates synchronize with the emerging dates of caterpillars are now evolving to reproductive in periods earlier than before the climate change. Several species are reacting like that and other ones are moving to the north in Europe for example. Nevertheless, and very curiously, European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, populations are behaving on the contrary: their laying dates are moving towards later spring and their distribution area is moving towards the south. In this study we explore and discuss about different factors that may explain this difference from other birds.",

    "abstract": "The development of a tractable small animal model faithfully reproducing human COVID-19 pathogenesis would arguably meet a pressing need in biomedical research. Thus far, most investigators have used transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 in epithelial cells (K18-hACE2 transgenic mice) that are intranasally instilled with a liquid SARS-CoV-2 suspension under deep anesthesia. Unfortunately, this experimental approach results in disproportionate high CNS infection leading to fatal encephalitis, which is rarely observed in humans and severely limits this models usefulness. Here, we describe the use of an inhalation tower system that allows exposure of unanesthetized mice to aerosolized virus under controlled conditions. Aerosol exposure of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice to SARS-CoV-2 resulted in robust viral replication in the respiratory tract, anosmia, and airway obstruction, but did not lead to fatal viral neuroinvasion. When compared to intranasal inoculation, aerosol infection resulted in a more pronounced lung pathology including increased immune infiltration, fibrin deposition and a transcriptional signature comparable to that observed in SARS-CoV-2- infected patients. This model may prove useful for studies of viral transmission, disease pathogenesis (including long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection) and therapeutic interventions.",

However, general principles that govern the emergence of biofilm architecture across different species remain unknown. Here, we combine experiments, simulations and statistical analysis to identify shared biophysical mechanisms that determine biofilm architecture development at the single-cell level, for the species Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our data-driven analysis reveals that despite the many molecular differences between these species, the biofilm architecture differences can be described by only two control parameters: cellular aspect ratio and cell density. Further experiments using single-species mutants for which the cell aspect ratio and the cell density are systematically varied, and mechanistic simulations, show that tuning these two control parameters reproduces biofilm architectures of different species. Altogether, our results show that early-stage biofilm architecture is determined by mechanical cell-cell interactions which are conserved across different species and, therefore, provide a unifying understanding of biofilm architecture development.",

    "abstract": "TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs) mediate outer membrane transport of nutrients using the energy derived from proton motive force transmitted from the TonB-ExbB-ExbD complex localized in the inner membrane. Recently, we discovered ddvT encoding a TBDT responsible for the uptake of a 5,5-type lignin-derived dimer in Sphingobium sp. strain SYK-6. Furthermore, overexpression of ddvT in an SYK-6-derivative strain enhanced its uptake capacity, improving the rate of platform chemical production. Thus, understanding the uptake system of lignin-derived aromatics is fundamental for microbial conversion-based lignin valorization. Here we examined whether multiple tonB-, exbB-, and exbD-like genes in SYK-6 contribute to the outer membrane transport of lignin-derived aromatics. The disruption of tonB2-6 and exbB3 did not reduce the capacity of SYK-6 to convert or grow on lignin-derived aromatics. In contrast, the introduction of the tonB1-exbB1-exbD1-exbD2 operon genes into SYK-6, which could not be disrupted, promoted the conversion of {beta}-O-4-, {beta}-5-, {beta}-1-, {beta}-{beta}-, and 5,5-type dimers and monomers, such as ferulate, vanillate, syringate, and protocatechuate. These results suggest that TonB-dependent uptake involving the tonB1 operon genes is responsible for the outer membrane transport of the above aromatics. Additionally, exbB2/tolQ and exbD3/tolR were suggested to constitute the Tol-Pal system that maintains the outer membrane integrity.",

    "abstract": "The phytopathogenic proteobacterium Dickeya dadantii secretes an array of plant cell wall degrading enzymes and other virulence factors via the type 2 secretion system (T2SS). T2SSs are widespread among important plant, animal and human bacterial pathogens. This multi-protein complex spans the double membrane cell envelope and secretes fully folded proteins through a large outer membrane pore formed by 15 subunits of the secretin GspD. Secretins are also found in the type 3 secretion system and the type 4 pili. Usually, specialized lipoproteins termed as pilotins assist the targeting and assembly of secretins into the outer membrane. Here, we show that in Dickeya, the pilotin acts in concert with the scaffolding protein GspB. Deletion of gspB profoundly impacts secretin assembly, pectinase secretion, and virulence. Structural studies reveal that GspB possesses a conserved periplasmic Homology Region domain that interacts directly with the N-terminal secretin domain. Site-specific photo cross-linking unravels molecular details of the GspB-GspD complex in vivo. We show that GspB facilitates outer membrane targeting and assembly of the secretin pores and anchors them to the inner membrane while the C-terminal extension of GspB scaffolds the secretin channel in the peptidoglycan cell wall. Phylogenetic analysis shows that in other bacteria, GspB homologs vary in length and domain composition and act in concert with either a cognate ATPase GspA or a pilotin GspS.\n\nImportanceGram-negative bacteria have two cell membranes sandwiching a peptidoglycan net that form together a robust protective cell envelope. To translocate effector proteins across this multilayer envelope, bacteria have evolved several specialized secretion systems. In the type 2 secretion system and some other bacterial machineries, secretins form large multimeric pores that allow transport of effector proteins or filaments across the outer membrane. The secretins are essential for nutrient acquisition and pathogenicity and constitute a target for development of new antibacterials. Targeting of secretin subunits into the outer membrane is often facilitated by a special class of lipoproteins called pilotins. Here, we show that in Dickeya and some other bacteria, the scaffolding protein GspB acts in concert with pilotin, facilitating the assembly of the secretin pore and its anchoring to both the inner membrane and the bacterial cell wall. GspB homologs of varied domain composition are present in many other T2SSs.",

However, there are only a few relevant \"candidates\" for such an approach, as targeting and detection one of the biggest challenges as well as there are many limitations in the use of genetic approaches. Here, it is proposed the solution that enables surface modification of alive bacterial cells without interfering with their genetic material and potentially reduces their toxic side effect. By the electrostatic interaction fluorescently labeled polyelectrolytes (PEs) and magnetite nanoparticles (NPs) were deposited on the bacterial cell surface to control the cell growth, distribution and detection of bacteria. According to the results obtained in vivo, by the magnet entrapment of the modified bacteria the local concentration of the cells was increased more than 5 times, keeping the high concentrations even when the magnet is removed. Since the PEs create a strong barrier, in vitro it was shown that the division time of the cells can be regulated for better immune presentation.",

    "abstract": "Traces of cadmium (Cd) have been reported in some chocolate products due to soils with Cd and the high ability of cacao plants to extract, transport, and accumulate it in their tissues. An agronomic strategy to minimize the uptake of Cd by plants is the use of cadmium-resistant bacteria (Cd-RB). However, knowledge about Cd-RB associated with cacao soils is scarce. This study was aimed to isolate and characterize Cd-RB associated with cacao-cultivated soils in Colombia that may be used in the bioremediation of Cd-polluted soils. Diversity of culturable Cd-RB, qualitative functional analysis related to nitrogen, phosphorous, carbon, and Cd were performed. Thirty different Cd-RB morphotypes were isolated from soils with medium (NC, Y1, Y2) and high (Y3) Cd concentrations using culture media with 6 mg Kg-1 Cd. Cd-RB were identified based on morphological and molecular analyses. The most abundant morphotypes (90%) were gram-negative belong to Phylum Proteobacteria and almost half of them showed the capacity to fix nitrogen, solubilize phosphates and degrade cellulose. Unique morphotypes were isolated from Y3 soils where Burkholderia and Pseudomonas were the dominant genera indicating their capacity to resist high Cd concentrations. P. putida GB78, P. aeruginosa NB2, and Burkholderia sp. NB10 were the only morphotypes that grew on 18 up to 90 (GB78) and 140 mg Kg-1 Cd (NB2-NB10); however, GB78 showed the highest Cd bioaccumulation (5.92 mg g-1). This study provides novel information about culturable Cd-RB soil diversity with the potential to develop biotechnology-based strategies.",

    "abstract": "Umbilical cord blood (UCB) has long been seen as a rich source of naive cells with strong regenerative potential, likely mediated by small extracellular vesicles (sEV). More recently, small extracellular vesicles (sEV), such as exosomes, have been shown to play essential roles in cell-to-cell communication, via the transport of numerous molecules, including small RNAs. Often explored for their potential as biomarkers, sEV are now known to have regenerative and immunomodulating characteristics, particularly if isolated from stem cell-rich tissues. In this study, we aim to characterize the immunomodulating properties of umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell sEV (herein referred as Exo-101), and explore their therapeutic potential for inflammatory skin diseases. Exo-101 was shown to shift macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype, which in turn exert paracrine effects on fibroblasts, despite previous inflammatory stimuli. Additionally, the incubation of PBMC with Exo-101 resulted in an reduction of total CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell proliferation and cytokine release, while specifically supporting the development of regulatory T-cells (Treg), by influencing FOXP3 expression. In a 3D model of psoriatic skin, Exo-101 reduced the expression of inflammatory and psoriatic markers IL-6, IL-8, CXCL10, COX-2, S100A7 and DEFB4. In vivo, Exo-101 significantly prevented or reversed acanthosis in imiquimod-induced psoriasis, and tendentially increased the number of Treg in skin, without having an overall impact on disease burden. This work provides evidence for the anti-inflammatory and tolerogenic effect of Exo-101, which may be harnessed for the treatment of Th17-driven inflammatory skin diseases, such as psoriasis.",

    "abstract": "The auxin-inducible degradation system in C. elegans allows for spatial and temporal control of protein degradation via heterologous expression of a single Arabidopsis thaliana F-box protein, transport inhibitor response 1 (AtTIR1). In this system, exogenous auxin (Indole-3-acetic acid; IAA) enhances the ability of AtTIR1 to function as a substrate recognition component that adapts engineered degron-tagged proteins to the endogenous C. elegans E3 ubiquitin ligases complex (SKR-1/2-CUL-1-F-box (SCF)), targeting them for degradation by the proteosome. While this system has been employed to dissect the developmental functions of many C. elegans proteins, we have found that several auxin-inducible degron (AID)-tagged proteins are constitutively degraded by AtTIR1 in the absence of auxin, leading to undesired loss-of-function phenotypes. In this manuscript, we adapt an orthogonal auxin-derivative/mutant AtTIR1 pair (C. elegans AID version 2 (C.e.AIDv2)) that transforms the specificity of allosteric regulation of TIR1 from IAA to one that is dependent on an auxin derivative harboring a bulky aryl group (5-Ph-IAA). We find that a mutant AtTIR1(F79G) allele that alters the ligand binding interface of TIR1 dramatically reduces ligand-independent degradation of multiple AID*-tagged proteins. In addition to solving the ectopic degradation problem for some AID targets, addition of 5-Ph-IAA to culture media of animals expressing AtTIR1(F79G) leads to more penetrant loss-of-function phenotypes for AID*-tagged proteins than those elicited by the AtTIR1-IAA pairing at similar auxin analog concentrations. The improved specificity and efficacy afforded by the mutant AtTIR1(F79G) allele expands the utility of the AID system and broadens the number of proteins that can be effectively targeted with it.\n\nARITCLE SUMMARYImplementation of the auxin induced degradation (AID) system has increased the power if the C. elegans model through its ability to rapidly degrade target proteins in the presence of the plant hormone auxin (IAA). The current C.e.AID system is limited in that a substantial level of target degradation occurs in the absence of ligand and full levels of target protein degradation require high levels of auxin inducer. In this manuscript, we modify the AID system to solve these problems.",

Recently, comprehensive metagenomics analysis has uncovered that the Asgard super-phylum is the closest yet known archaea host of eukaryotes. However, it remains to be established if a large number of eukaryotic signature proteins predicated to be encoded by the Asgard super-phylum are functional at least, in the context of a eukaryotic cell. Here, we determined the three-dimensional structure of profilin from Thorarchaeota by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and show that this profilin has a rigid core with a flexible N-terminus which was previously implicated in polyproline binding. In addition, we also show that thorProfilin co-localizes with eukaryotic actin in cultured HeLa cells. This finding reaffirm the notion that Asgardean encoded proteins possess eukaryotic-like characteristics and strengthen likely existence of a complex cytoskeleton already in a last eukaryotic common ancestor.",

Furthermore, we also harness the system for multiplex editing of genes and large genomic regions. Multiplex deletion was achieved with more than 80 % efficiency, while simultaneous integration at two distantly located sites was obtained with 58 % efficiency.

A most interesting observation was that nervous response from CNS occurs pre-symptomatically, an observation that bring new understanding to how virus give raise to clinical symptoms. In the CNS of infected animals, we found increased pS6 immunoreactivity in the area postrema and decreased phosphorylated STAT5-immunoreactive neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, which are associated with autonomic control including stress response.

Samples were obtained in three technical replicates at 1 km from the dam at 1, 13 and 25 m depths. For each minibarcodes -- COI, 12S and 16S -- 1.5 million paired-reads (150 base pairs) were sequenced. A total of 44 unique taxa were found. COI identified most of the taxa (34 taxa; 77.2 %) followed by 16S (14; 31.8 %) and 12S (10; 22.7 %). All minibarcodes identified fishes (13 taxa), however, COI detected other aquatic macro-invertebrates (18), algae (3) and amoebas (2). Richness was the same across the three depths (35 taxa), although, beta diversity suggested slightly divergent profiles. In just one location we identified 15 taxa never reported previously, 50% of the fish species identified in the last year of fishery monitoring and 13% of the species in biodiversity surveys performed from 2012 to 2021. Clustering into Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASV) showed that 12S and 16S are able to detect predominant haplotypes of fishes, suggesting they are suitable to study population genetics of this group. In this study we reviewed the species occurring within the Tres Irmaos reservoir according to previous conventional surveys and demonstrated that eDNA metabarcoding can be applied to monitor its biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Liver fibrosis is the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix that can progress to cirrhosis and failure if untreated (1). The mechanisms of fibrogenesis are multi-faceted and remain elusive with no approved antifibrotic treatments available (2). Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of the adult zebrafish liver to study the molecular and cellular dynamics of the liver at a single-cell level and demonstrate the value of the adult zebrafish as a model for studying liver fibrosis. scRNA-seq reveals transcriptionally unique populations of hepatic cell types that comprise the zebrafish liver. Joint clustering with human liver scRNA-seq data demonstrates high conservation of transcriptional profiles and human marker genes in zebrafish cell types. Human and zebrafish hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the driver cell in liver fibrosis (3), specifically show conservation of transcriptional profiles and we uncover Colec11 as a novel, conserved marker for zebrafish HSCs. To demonstrate the power of scRNA-seq to study liver fibrosis, we performed scRNA-seq on our zebrafish model of a pediatric liver disease with characteristic early, progressive liver fibrosis caused by mutation in mannose phosphate isomerase (MPI) (4-6). Comparison of differentially expressed genes from human and zebrafish MPI mutant HSC datasets demonstrated similar activation of fibrosis signaling pathways and upstream regulators. CellPhoneDB analysis revealed important receptor-ligand interactions within normal and fibrotic states. This study establishes the first scRNA-seq atlas of the adult zebrafish liver, highlights the high degree of similarity to the human liver, and strengthens its value as a model to study liver fibrosis.\n\nSignificance StatementTo our knowledge, this is the first single-cell characterization of the adult zebrafish liver, both in a normal physiologic state and in the setting of liver fibrosis. We identify transcriptionally distinct zebrafish liver cell populations and a high degree of transcriptional conservation between human and zebrafish cells across the majority of hepatic cell types. Furthermore, using this scRNA transcriptome, we identify key signaling pathways in zebrafish HSCs that are replicated in human HSCs and implicated in the regulation of liver fibrosis. Our work provides a useful resource that can be used to aid research using the zebrafish liver and asserts the usefulness of the adult zebrafish to study liver fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Integrity of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), encoding several subunits of the respiratory chain, is essential to maintain mitochondrial fitness. Mitochondria, as a central hub for metabolism, are affected in a wide variety of human diseases but also during normal ageing, where mtDNA integrity is compromised. Mitochondrial quality control mechanisms work at different levels, and mitophagy and its variants are critical to remove dysfunctional mitochondria together with mtDNA to maintain cellular homeostasis. Understanding the mechanisms governing a selective turnover of mutation-bearing mtDNA without affecting the entire mitochondrial pool is fundamental to design therapeutic strategies against mtDNA diseases and ageing. Here we show that mtDNA depletion after expressing a dominant negative version of the mitochondrial helicase Twinkle, or by chemical means, is due to an exacerbated mtDNA turnover. Targeting of nucleoids is controlled by Twinkle which, together with the mitochondrial transmembrane proteins ATAD3 and SAMM50, orchestrate mitochondrial membrane remodeling to form extrusions. mtDNA removal depends on autophagy and requires the vesicular trafficking protein VPS35 which binds to Twinkle-enriched mitochondrial subcompartments upon mtDNA damage. Stimulation of autophagy by rapamycin selectively removes mtDNA deletions which accumulated during muscle regeneration in vivo, but without affecting mtDNA copy number. With these results we unveil a new complex mechanism specifically targeting and removing mutant mtDNA which occurs outside the mitochondrial network. We reveal the molecular targets involved in a process with multiple potential benefits against human mtDNA related diseases, either inherited, acquired or due to normal ageing.",

    "abstract": "Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) often present with skeletal abnormalities; a condition known as renal osteodystrophy (ROD). While Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) and PHOSPHO1 are recognized to be critical for bone mineralization, their role in the etiology of ROD is unclear. To address this, ROD was induced in both wild-type and Phospho1 knockout (P1KO) mice using dietary adenine supplementation. The mice presented with hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and elevated levels of FGF23 and bone turnover markers. In particular, we noted that in CKD mice, bone mineral density (BMD) was increased in cortical bone (p < 0.05) but decreased in trabecular bone (p < 0.05). These changes were accompanied by decreased TNAP (p < 0.01) and increased PHOSPHO1 (p < 0.001) expression in wild-type CKD bones. In P1KO CKD mice, the cortical BMD phenotype was rescued, suggesting that the increased cortical BMD of CKD mice was driven by increased PHOSPHO1 expression. Other structural parameters were also improved in P1KO CKD mice. We further investigated the driver of the mineralization defects, by studying the effects of FGF23, PTH, and phosphate administration on PHOSPHO1 and TNAP expression by primary murine osteoblasts. We found both PHOSPHO1 and TNAP expression to be down-regulated in response to phosphate and PTH. While matrix mineralization was increased with phosphate (Pi), it decreased with PTH and FGF23 had no effect. The in vitro data suggest that the TNAP reduction in CKD-MBD is driven by the hyperphosphatemia and/or hyperparathyroidism noted in these mice, while the higher PHOSPHO1 expression may be a compensatory mechanism in an attempt to protect the bone from hypomineralization. We propose that increased PHOSPHO1 expression in ROD may contribute to the disordered skeletal mineralization characteristic of this progressive disorder.",

However, recent studies have suggested that megakaryocyte progenitors are generated at the level of HSCs. In this study, we newly identified early megakaryocyte lineage-committed progenitors (MgPs) in CD201-CD48- cells and CD48+ cells separated from the CD150+CD34-Kit+Sca-1+Lin- HSC population of the bone marrow in C57BL/6 mice. Single-cell transplantation and single-cell colony assay showed that MgPs, unlike platelet-biased HSCs, had little repopulating potential in vivo, but formed larger megakaryocyte colonies in vitro (on average eight megakaryocytes per colony) than did previously reported megakaryocyte progenitors (MkPs). Single-cell RNA-sequencing supported that these MgPs lie between HSCs and MkPs along the megakaryocyte differentiation pathway. Single-cell colony assay and single-cell RT-PCR analysis suggested the coexpression of CD41 and Pf4 is associated with megakaryocyte colony-forming activity. Single-cell colony assay of a small number of cells generated from single HSCs in culture suggested that MgPs are not direct progeny of HSCs. In this study, we propose a differentiation model in which HSCs give rise to MkPs through MgPs.",

    "abstract": "In model organisms, RNA sequencing is frequently used to assess the effect of genetic mutations on cellular and developmental processes. Typically, animals heterozygous for a mutation are crossed to produce offspring with different genotypes. Resultant embryos are grouped by genotype to compare homozygous mutant embryos to heterozygous and wild-type siblings. Genes that are differentially expressed between the groups are assumed to reveal insights into the pathways affected by the mutation.\n\nHere we show that in zebrafish, differentially expressed genes are often overrepresented on the same chromosome as the mutation due to different levels of expression of alleles from different genetic backgrounds. Using an incross of haplotype-resolved wild-type fish, we found evidence of widespread allele-specific expression, which appears as differential expression when comparing embryos homozygous for a region of the genome to their siblings. When analysing mutant transcriptomes, this means that differentially expressed genes on the same chromosome as a mutation of interest may not be caused by that mutation.\n\nTypically, the genomic location of a differentially expressed gene is not considered when interpreting its importance with respect to the phenotype. This could lead to pathways being erroneously implicated or overlooked due to the noise of spurious differentially expressed genes on the same chromosome as the mutation. These observations have implications for the interpretation of RNA-seq experiments involving outbred animals and non-inbred model organisms.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH)-citrate synthase (CS) multi-enzyme complex is a part of the Krebs tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle  metabolon which is enzyme machinery catalyzing sequential reactions without diffusion of reaction intermediates into a bulk matrix. This complex is assumed to be a dynamic structure involved in the regulation of the cycle by enhancing metabolic flux. Microscale Thermophoresis analysis of the porcine heart MDH-CS complex revealed that substrates of the MDH and CS reactions, NAD+ and acetyl-CoA, enhance complex association while products of the reactions, NADH and citrate, weaken the affinity of the complex. Oxaloacetate enhanced the interaction only when it was presented together with acetyl-CoA. Structural modeling using published CS structures suggested that the binding of these substrates can stabilize the closed format of CS which favors the MDH-CS association. Two other TCA cycle intermediates, ATP, and low pH also enhanced the association of the complex. These results suggest that dynamic formation of the MDH-CS multi-enzyme complex is modulated by metabolic factors responding to respiratory metabolism, and it may function in the feedback regulation of the cycle and adjacent metabolic pathways.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) and Alzheimers disease related dementias (ADRDs) affect 6 million Americans and they are projected to have an estimated health care cost of $355 billion for 2021. A histopathological hallmark of AD and many ADRDs is the aberrant intracellular accumulation of the microtubule associated protein tau. These neurodegenerative disorders that contain tau aggregates are collectively known as tauopathies and recent structural studies have shown that different tauopathies are characterized by different \"strains\" of tau filaments. In addition, mutations in the gene that encodes for tau protein expression have been associated with a group of tauopathies known as frontotemporal dementias with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17 or familial frontotemporal dementia). In vitro studies often use small molecules to induce tau aggregation as tau is extremely soluble and does not spontaneously aggregate in typical lab conditions and the use of authentic filaments to conduct in vitro studies is not feasible. This study highlights how different inducer molecules can have fundamental disparities to how disease related mutations effect the aggregation dynamics of tau. Using three different classes of tau aggregation inducer molecules we characterized disease relevant mutations in taus PGGG motifs at positions P301S, P332S, and P364S. When comparing these mutations to wild type tau, we found that depending on the type of inducer molecule used we saw fundamental differences in total aggregation, aggregation kinetics, immunoreactivity, and filament morphology. These data support the hypothesis that different tau aggregation inducer molecules make different polymorphs and perhaps structurally distinct strains.",

    "abstract": "To rapidly respond and adapt to stresses, such as viral infections, cells have evolved several mechanisms, which include the activation of stress response pathways and the innate immune response. These stress responses result in the rapid inhibition of translation and condensation of stalled mRNAs, together with RNA-binding proteins and signalling components, into cytoplasmic biocondensates called stress granules. Increasing evidence suggests that stress granules contribute to antiviral defense and thus viruses need to evade these response pathways to propagate. In addition, the stress granule pathway is proposed to be dynamic and adaptable to specific stresses. We previously showed that Feline Calicivirus (FCV) impairs SGs assembly by cleaving the scaffolding protein G3BP1. We also observed that uninfected bystander cells assembled G3BP1-granules, suggesting a paracrine response trigged by the infection. We now present evidence that virus-free supernatant generated from infected cells can induce the formation of paracrine granules. They are different from canonical stress granules and exhibit specific kinetics of assembly-disassembly, protein and RNA composition and are linked to antiviral activity. We propose that this paracrine induction reflects a novel cellular defence mechanism to limit viral propagation and promote stress responses in bystander cells.\n\nSummary statementWe describe a novel type of paracrine induced RNA granules associated with viruses, highlighting how different stresses results in heterogeneous stress granule-like condensates with specific cellular functions.",

    "abstract": "Yeast vacuolar membrane fusion has been reconstituted with R, Qa, Qb, and Qc-family SNAREs, Sec17/SNAP, Sec18/NSF, and the hexameric HOPS complex. HOPS tethers membranes and catalyzes SNARE assembly into RQaQbQc trans-complexes which zipper through their SNARE domains to promote fusion. Previously, we demonstrated that Sec17 and Sec18 can bypass the requirement of complete zippering for fusion (Song et al., 2021), but it has been unclear whether this activity of Sec17 and Sec18 is directly coupled to HOPS. HOPS can be replaced for fusion by a synthetic tether when the three Q-SNAREs are pre-assembled. We now report that SNARE zippering-arrested fusion intermediates that are formed without HOPS support Sec17/Sec18-triggered fusion. This zippering-bypass fusion is thus a direct result of Sec17 and Sec18 interactions: with each other, with the platform of partially zippered SNAREs, and with the apposed tethered membranes. As these fusion elements are shared among all exocytic and endocytic traffic, Sec17 and Sec18 may have a general role in directly promoting fusion.",

    "abstract": "Cortical bone quality, which is sexually dimorphic, depends on bone turnover and therefore the activities of remodeling bone cells. However, sex differences in cortical bone metabolism are not yet defined. Adding to the uncertainty about cortical bone metabolism, the metabolomes of whole bone, isolated cortical bone without marrow, and bone marrow have not been compared. We hypothesized that the metabolome of isolated cortical bone would be distinct from that of bone marrow and would reveal sex differences. Metabolite profiles from LC-MS of whole bone, isolated cortical bone, and bone marrow were generated from humeri from 20-week-old female C57Bl/6J mice. The cortical bone metabolomes were then compared for 20-week-old female and male C57Bl/6J mice. Femurs from male and female mice were evaluated for flexural material properties and were then categorized into bone strength groups. The metabolome of isolated cortical bone was distinct from both whole bone and bone marrow. We also found sex differences in the isolated cortical bone metabolome. Based on metabolite pathway analysis, females had higher lipid metabolism, and males had higher amino acid metabolism. High-strength bones, regardless of sex, had greater tryptophan and purine metabolism. For males, high strength bones had upregulated nucleotide metabolism, whereas lower strength bones had greater pentose phosphate pathway metabolism. Since the higher strength groups (females compared with males, high strength males compared with lower strength males) had higher serum CTX1/P1NP, we estimate that the metabolomic signature of bone strength in our study at least partially reflects differences in bone turnover. These data provide novel insight into bone bioenergetics and the sexual dimorphic nature of bone material properties in C57Bl/6 mice.",

    "abstract": "Varroa destructor is considered a major reason for high loss rate of Western honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies. To prevent colony losses caused by V. destructor it is necessary to actively manage the mite population. Beekeepers, particularly commercial beekeepers, have few alternative treatments other than synthetic acaricides to control the parasite, resulting in intensive treatment regimens that led to the evolution of resistance in mite populations.\n\nTo investigate the mechanism of the resistance to amitraz detected in V. destructor mites from French and U.S. apiaries, we identified and characterized octopamine and tyramine receptors (the known targets of amitraz) in this species. The comparison of sequences obtained from mites collected from different apiaries with different treatment regimens, showed that the amino acid substitutions N87S or Y215H in the Oct{beta}R were associated with treatment failures reported in French or U.S. apiaries, respectively. Based on our findings, we have developed and tested two high throughput diagnostic assays based on TaqMan(R) able to accurately detect mites carrying the mutations in this receptor. This valuable information may be of help for beekeepers when selecting the most suitable acaricide to manage V. destructor.",
