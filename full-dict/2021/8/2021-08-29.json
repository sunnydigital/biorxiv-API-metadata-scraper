    "abstract": "Animal brains have evolved to encode social stimuli and transform these representations into advantageous behavioral responses. The commonalities and differences of these representations across species are not well-understood. Here, we show that social isolation activates an oxytocinergic (OXT), nociceptive circuit in the larval zebrafish hypothalamus and that chemical cues released from conspecific animals are potent modulators of this circuits activity. We delineate an olfactory to subpallial pathway that transmits chemical social cues to OXT circuitry, where they are transformed into diverse outputs simultaneously regulating defensive and feeding behaviors. Our data allow us to propose a model through which social stimuli are integrated within a fundamental neural circuit to mediate diverse adaptive behaviours.",

    "abstract": "Landscape connectedness shapes the exchange of individuals among patches, and hence metapopulation connectivity and dynamics. Connectedness, and its resulting effects on connectivity are therefore rightfully central in conservation biology. However, besides determining demographic fluxes of individuals between patches, connectedness also generates phenotypic sorting and thus impacts local and regional eco-evolutionary dynamics. Despite the central role of connectedness, its effects on individual phenotypic heterogeneity and spatial organization are so far neglected in theory and applications.\n\nThrough experimental metapopulations of Tetranychus urticae (two-spotted spider mite) with three levels of landscape connectedness and by regularly removing phenotypic structure in a subset of these populations, we tested how regional and local population dynamics are determined both by network connectedness and phenotypic spatial organization.\n\nWe find that the self-organizing phenotypic spatial structure increases local equilibrium population sizes and variability. It in contrast dampens the effects of imposed connectedness differences on population sizes and is therefore anticipated to improve metapopulation persistence. Contrary to theoretical expectations, the most locally connected patches within the network showed an overall reduced local population size, possibly originating from a faster depletion of resources from immigrants or transiting individuals.\n\nThis experiment shows how metapopulation dynamics can significantly deviate from theoretical expectations due to individual heterogeneity. This potential rescue effect stemming from phenotypical self-organization in space is a key point to consider for conservation actions, especially based on translocations.",

Structures in isolation and bound to tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) show that this [~]55 kDa purported tRNA mimic undergoes large conformational rearrangements to bind TyrRS in a form that differs dramatically from tRNA.

Recent researches have shown that attention-based encoder layers are more suitable to learn high-level features. Based on this key observation, we treat low-level representation learning and high-level representation learning separately, and propose a two-level general-purpose protein structure embedding neural network, called ContactLib-ATT. On the local embedding level, a simple yet meaningful hydrogen-bond representation is learned. On the global embedding level, attention-based encoder layers are employed for global representation learning. In our experiments, ContactLib-ATT achieves a SCOP superfamily classification accuracy of 82.4% (i.e., 6.7% higher than state-of-the-art method) on the SCOP40 2.07 dataset. Moreover, ContactLib-ATT is demonstrated to successfully simulate a structure-based search engine for remote homologous proteins, and our top-10 candidate list contains at least one remote homolog with a probability of 91.9%.

    "abstract": "The development of effective vaccines that can be rapidly manufactured and distributed worldwide is necessary to mitigate the devastating health and economic impacts of pandemics like COVID-19. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which mediates host cell entry of the virus, is an appealing antigen for subunit vaccines because it is efficient to manufacture, highly stable, and a target for neutralizing antibodies. Unfortunately, RBD is poorly immunogenic. While most subunit vaccines are commonly formulated with adjuvants to enhance their immunogenicity, we found that clinically-relevant adjuvants Alum, AddaVax, and CpG/Alum were unable to elicit neutralizing responses following a prime-boost immunization. Here we show that sustained delivery of an RBD subunit vaccine comprising CpG/Alum adjuvant in an injectable polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel elicited potent anti-RBD and anti-spike antibody titers, providing broader protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern compared to bolus administration of the same vaccine and vaccines comprising other clinically-relevant adjuvant systems. Notably, a SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentivirus neutralization assay revealed that hydrogel-based vaccines elicited potent neutralizing responses when bolus vaccines did not. Together, these results suggest that slow delivery of RBD subunit vaccines with PNP hydrogels can significantly enhance the immunogenicity of RBD and induce neutralizing humoral immunity.",

    "abstract": "Among the many health benefits Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) presents, anti-aging is of special interest (Shen, Jiang, Yang, Wang, & Zhu, 2017; Zhao & Luo, 2017). Reported to possess anti-aging effects, the CHM Rhodiola rosea L., known colloquially as the \"golden root\", has been widely incorporated in various drinks, daily supplements, and even cosmetics. This study investigates the effects of commercial R. rosea extracts and natural R. rosea roots on preventing UV-induced photoaging of the skin and correlates such effects with the composition of active ingredients in the extracts. To simulate the photoaging process, drug treated HaCaT cells were exposed to UVA and UVB radiation. The pharmacological anti-aging effects of R. rosea extracts were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively through confocal immunofluorescence images with {gamma}-H2A.X marker and telomerase activity assay (Telo TAGGG Telomerase PCR-ELISA). Preparatory thin layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography were performed to isolate and quantify active ingredients. Cultured HaCaT cells showed morphological change after exposure to both UVA (>15.0 J) and UVB (>2000 mJ). The photoaging of keratinocytes was rescued by pretreating cells with R. rosea extracts as well as salidroside and rosavin active ingredients (P < 0.05). R. rosea-treated cells were characterized by increased telomerase activity and fewer {gamma}-H2A.X foci compared to that of the control. Extracts with better preventative effects contained higher salidroside and rosavin content. The findings in this study reaffirm R. roseas efficacy as an anti-aging remedy and provide a basis for CHMs integration into the mainstream of global healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Arabidopsis thaliana is an important and long-established model species for plant molecular biology, genetics, epigenetics, and genomics. However, the latest version of reference genome still contains significant number of missing segments. Here, we report a high-quality and almost complete Col-0 genome assembly with two gaps (Col-XJTU) using combination of Oxford Nanopore Technology ultra-long reads, PacBio high-fidelity long reads, and Hi-C data. The total genome assembly size is 133,725,193 bp, introducing 14.6 Mb of novel sequences compared to the TAIR10.1 reference genome. All five chromosomes of Col-XJTU assembly are highly accurate with consensus quality (QV) scores > 60 (ranging from 62 to 68), which are higher than those of TAIR10.1 reference (QV scores ranging from 45 to 52). We have completely resolved chromosome (Chr) 3 and Chr5 in a telomere-to-telomere manner. Chr4 has been completely resolved except the nucleolar organizing regions, which comprise long repetitive DNA fragments. The Chr1 centromere (CEN1), reportedly around 9 Mb in length, is particularly challenging to assemble due to the presence of tens of thousands of CEN180 satellite repeats. Using the cutting-edge sequencing data and novel computational approaches, we assembled about 4 Mb of sequence for CEN1 and a 3.5-Mb-long CEN2. We investigated the structure and epigenetics of centromeres. We detected four clusters of CEN180 monomers, and found that the centromere-specific histone H3-like protein (CENH3) exhibits a strong preference for CEN180 cluster 3. Moreover, we observed hypomethylation patterns in CENH3-enriched regions. We believe that this high-quality genome assembly, Col-XJTU, would serve as a valuable reference to better understand the global pattern of centromeric polymorphisms, as well as genetic and epigenetic features in plants.",

    "abstract": "Rodents use whisking to probe actively their environment and to locate objects in space, hence providing a paradigmatic biological example of active sensing. Numerous studies show that the control of whisking has anticipatory aspects. For example, rodents target their whisker protraction to the distance at which they expect objects, rather than just reacting fast to contacts with unexpected objects. Here we characterize the anticipatory control of whisking in rodents as an active inference process. In this perspective, the rodent is endowed with a prior belief that it will touch something at the end of the whisker protraction, and it continuously modulates its whisking amplitude to minimize (proprioceptive and somatosensory) prediction errors arising from an unexpected whisker-object contact, or from a lack of an expected contact. We will use the model to qualitatively reproduce key empirical findings about the ways rodents modulate their whisker amplitude during exploration and the scanning of (expected or unexpected) objects. Furthermore, we will discuss how the components of active inference model can in principle map to the neurobiological circuits of rodent whisking.",

We manipulated DNA supercoiling in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by CRISPRi-based knock-down of gyrase subunits and overexpression of topoisomerase I (TopoI), and characterized the phenotypes. Cell division was blocked, most likely due to inhibition of genomic but not plasmid DNA replication. Cell growth continued to 4-5x of the wildtype cell volume, and metabolic flux was redirected towards glycogen in the TopoI overexpression strain. TopoI induction initially lead to down-regulation of GC-rich and up-regulation of AT-rich genes. The response quickly bifurcated and four diurnal co-expression cohorts (dawn, noon, dusk and night) all responded differently, in part with a circadian ({approx} 24 h) pattern. A GC-rich region - 50 bp of transcription start sites is differentially enriched in these four cohorts. We suggest a model where energy- and gyrase-gated transcription of growth genes at the dark/light transition (dawn) generates DNA supercoiling which then facilitates DNA replication and initiates the diurnal transcriptome program.",

    "abstract": "{beta}-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and their metabolites are deeply involved in the development of Alzheimers disease (AD). Upon the upregulation of {beta}-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), its product, the {beta}-carboxyl-terminal fragment of APP ({beta}CTF), is accumulated in the early stage of sporadic AD brains. {beta}CTF accumulation is currently considered the trigger for endosomal anomalies to form enlarged endosomes, one of the earliest pathologies in AD. However, the details of the underlying mechanism remain largely unclear. In this study, using BACE1 stably-overexpressing cells, we describe that lipid flippase subcomponent TMEM30A interacts with accumulated {beta}CTF. Among the lipid flippases in endosomes, those composed of TMEM30A and active subcomponent ATP8A1 transports phospholipid, phosphatidylserine (PS), to the cytosolic side of the endosomes. The lipid flippase activity and cytosolic PS distribution are critical for membrane fission and vesicle transport. Intriguingly, accumulated {beta}CTF in model cells impaired lipid flippase physiological formation and activity, along with endosome enlargement. Moreover, in the brains of AD model mice before the amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) deposition, the TMEM30A/{beta}CTF complex formation occurred, followed by lipid flippase dysfunction. Importantly, our novel A{beta}/{beta}CTF interacting TMEM30A-derived peptide \"T-RAP\" improved endosome enlargement and reduced {beta}CTF levels. These T-RAP effects could result from the recovery of lipid flippase activity. Therefore, we propose lipid flippase dysfunction as a key pathogenic event and a novel therapeutic target for AD.",

Older individuals with a vitamin B12 deficiency are at a higher risk for ischemic stroke and have worse stroke outcome. However, the mechanisms through which these occur remain unknown. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of vitamin B12 deficiency in ischemic stroke outcome and mechanistic changes in a mouse model. Ten-month-old male and female mice were put on control or vitamin B12 deficient diets for 4-weeks prior to and after ischemic stroke to the sensorimotor cortex. Motor function was measured, and tissues were collected to assess potential mechanisms. All deficient mice had increased levels of total homocysteine in plasma and liver tissues. After ischemic stroke, deficient mice had impaired motor function compared to control mice. There was no difference between groups in lesion volume, however, there was an increase in total apoptosis within the ischemic region of brain tissue in male deficient mice. More neuronal survival was present in ischemic brain tissue of the deficient mice compared to controls. Additionally, there were changes in choline metabolites in ischemic brain tissue because of a vitamin B12 deficiency. The data presented in this study confirms that a vitamin B12 deficiency worsens stroke outcome in male and female mice. The mechanisms driving this change may be a result of neuronal survival and compensation in choline metabolism within the damaged brain tissue.",

During sexual reproduction, bryophytes produce spermatozoids with two mitochondria in the cell body. Although intensive morphological analyses have been conducted thus far, how this fixed number of mitochondria is realized remains unknown. Here, we investigated how mitochondria are reorganized during spermiogenesis in Marchantia polymorpha. We found that the mitochondrial number is reduced to one through fission followed by autophagic degradation during early spermiogenesis, and then the posterior mitochondrion arises by fission of the anterior mitochondrion. Autophagy is also responsible for the removal of other organelles, including peroxisomes, but these other organelles are removed at distinct developmental stages from mitochondrial degradation. We also found that spermiogenesis involves nonautophagic organelle degradation. Our findings highlight the dynamic reorganization of mitochondria, which is regulated distinctly from that of other organelles, and multiple degradation mechanisms operate in organelle remodeling during spermiogenesis in M. polymorpha.",

    "abstract": "In recent months, several SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged that enhance transmissibility and escape host humoral immunity. Hence, the tracking of viral evolutionary trajectories is clearly of great importance. Little is known about SARS-CoV-2 evolution in nonhuman primate models used to test vaccines and therapies and to model human disease. Viral RNA was sequenced from rectal swabs from Chlorocebus aethiops (African green monkeys) after experimental respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two distinct patterns of viral evolution were identified that were shared between all collected samples. First, mutations in the furin cleavage site that were initially present in the virus as a consequence of VeroE6 cell culture adaptation were subsequently lost in virus recovered in rectal swabs, confirming the necessity of this motif for viral infection in vivo. Three amino acid changes were also identified; ORF 1a S2103F, and spike D215G and H655Y, that were detected in rectal swabs from all sampled animals. These findings are demonstrative of intra-host SARS-CoV-2 evolution unique to this nonhuman primate species and may identify a host-adapted variant of SARS-CoV-2 that would be useful in future development of primate disease models.",

    "abstract": "The causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, has a 29,903 bases positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. RNAs exhibit about 100 modified bases that are essential for proper function. Among internal modified bases, the N6-methyladenosine, or m6A, is the most frequent, and is implicated in SARS-CoV-2 immune response evasion. Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome is RNA, almost all genomes sequenced so far are in fact, reverse transcribed complementary DNAs. This process reduces the true complexity of these viral genomes because incorporation of dNTPs hides RNA base modifications. Here, in this perspective paper, we present an initial exploration of the Nanopore direct RNA sequencing to assess the m6A residues in the SARS-CoV-2 sequences of ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, N, ORF10 and the 3-untranslated region. We identified 15 m6A methylated positions, of which, 6 are in ORF N. Also, because m6A is associated with the DRACH motif, we compared its distribution in major SARS-CoV-2 variants. Although DRACH is highly conserved among variants we show that variants Beta and Eta have a fourth position C>U change in DRACH at 28,884b that could affect methylation. The Nanopore technology offers a unique opportunity for the study of viral epitranscriptomics. This technique is PCR-free and is not sequencing-by-synthesis, therefore, no PCR bias and synthesis errors are introduced. The modified bases are preserved and assessed directly with no need for chemical treatments or antibodies. This is the first report of direct RNA sequencing of a Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 sample coupled with the identification of modified bases.",

    "abstract": "Prime Editor (PE) has tremendous promise for gene therapy. However, it remains a challenge to deliver PE (>6.3 kb) in vivo. Although PE can be split into two fragments and delivered using dual adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), choice of split sites within Cas9 - which affects editing efficiency - is limited due to the large size of PE. Furthermore, the potential effect of overexpressing RT in mammalian cells is largely unknown. Here, we developed a compact PE with complete deletion of the RNase H domain of reverse transcriptase (RT), which showed comparable editing to full-length PE. Using compact PE, we tested the effect of 4 different Cas9 split sites and found that the Glu 573 split site supports robust editing (up to 93% of full-length PE). The compact PE, but not PE2, abolished its binding to eRF1 and showed minimal effect on stop codon readthrough, which therefore might reduce the effects on protein biosynthesis. This study identifies a safe and efficient compact PE2 that enables flexible split-PE design to facilitate efficient delivery in vivo and advance the utility of prime editing.",

    "abstract": "Vertical transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) leads with high frequency to congenital ZIKV syndrome (CZS), whose worst outcome is microcephaly. However, the mechanisms of congenital ZIKV neurodevelopmental pathologies, including direct cytotoxicity to neural progenitor cells (NPC), placental insufficiency, and immune responses, remain incompletely understood. At the cellular level, microcephaly typically results from death or insufficient proliferation of NPC or cortical neurons. NPCs replicate fast, requiring efficient DNA damage responses to ensure genome stability. Like congenital ZIKV infection, mutations in the polynucleotide 5-kinase 3-phosphatase (PNKP) gene, which encodes a critical DNA damage repair enzyme, results in recessive syndromes often characterized by congenital microcephaly with seizures (MCSZ). We thus tested whether there were any links between ZIKV and PNKP.\n\nHere we show that two PNKP phosphatase inhibitors or PNKP knockout inhibited ZIKV replication. PNKP relocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in infected cells, co-localizing with the marker of ZIKV replication factories (RF) NS1 and resulting in functional nuclear PNKP depletion. Although infected NPC accumulated DNA damage, they failed to activate the DNA damage checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2. ZIKV also induced activation of cytoplasmic CycA/CDK1 complexes, which trigger unscheduled mitotic entry. Inhibition of CDK1 activity inhibited ZIKV replication and the formation of RF, supporting a role of cytoplasmic CycA/CDK1 in RF morphogenesis. In brief, ZIKV infection induces mitotic catastrophe resulting from unscheduled mitotic entry in the presence of DNA damage. PNKP and CycA/CDK1 are thus host factors participating in ZIKV replication in NPC, and pathogenesis to neural progenitor cells.\n\nSignificanceThe 2015-2017 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in Brazil and subsequent international epidemic revealed the strong association between ZIKV infection and congenital malformations, mostly neurodevelopmental defects up to microcephaly. The scale and global expansion of the epidemic, the new ZIKV outbreaks (Kerala state, India, 2021), and the potential burden of future ones pose a serious ongoing risk. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms resulting in microcephaly remain incompletely understood. Here we show that ZIKV infection of neuronal progenitor cells results in cytoplasmic sequestration of an essential DNA repair protein itself associated with microcephaly, with the consequent accumulation of DNA damage, together with an unscheduled activation of cytoplasmic CDK1/Cyclin A complexes in the presence of DNA damage. These alterations result in mitotic catastrophe of neuronal progenitors, which would lead to a depletion of cortical neurons during development.",

    "abstract": "Glutaredoxins (Grxs) are single-domain redox enzymes of the thioredoxin superfamily, and primarily function as glutathione (GSH) dependent disulphide reductases. Whereas, the E. coli Glutaredoxin 2 (EcGrx2) encoded by grxB has two conserved GST-fold domains, it still lacks a classical Grx-like functions. In this study, we show for the first time, that EcGrx2 exists in both soluble and membrane integrated forms. The soluble form associates with a previously unidentified GSH dependent dehydroascrobate (DHA) reductase, and the membrane integrated form possesses ion channel activities. Using enzyme kinetic data and structural data we unequivocally demonstrate that EcGrx2 recycles ascorbate (AsA) from DHA. This ability to recycle AsA is inhibited by Zinc (Zn2+). We also show that both wildtype and the E. coli grxB deletion mutant can be rescued from H2O2-induced oxidative stress using ascorbate as an antioxidant, which otherwise is only known as a carbon source in bacteria. Moreover, the grxB- mutant is susceptible to intracellular killing by ROS producing macrophages. We further discovered that EcGrx2 integrates into the native E. coli membrane and show that the purified soluble protein readily inserts into artificial lipid bilayer membrane and conducts ions in vitro. Our data demonstrates a highly conserved functional similarity among EcGrx2-orthologs and highlights that the utilization and subsequent recycling of ascorbate as an antioxidant by grxB harbouring gram-negative bacteria, including human pathogens, may provide a survival advantage under hostile oxidative environments.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a one-step method to isolate protein C-terminal peptides from V8 protease-digested proteins by metal oxide-based ligand-exchange (MOLEX) chromatography. V8 protease cleaves the C-terminal side of Asp and Glu, affording a digested peptide with two carboxy groups at the C-terminus, whereas the protein C-terminal peptide has only one -carboxy group. In MOLEX chromatography, a stable chelate is formed between dicarboxylates and metal atoms, so that the non-terminal (i.e., internal) peptide is retained, whereas the protein C-terminal peptide flows through the MOLEX column. After optimization of the MOLEX chromatographic conditions, 1619 protein C-termini were identified from 30 g of peptides (10 g each, in triplicate) derived from human HeLa cells by means of nanoLC/MS/MS. When the MOLEX-isolated sample from 200 {micro}g of HeLa peptides was further divided into six fractions by high-pH reversed-phase LC prior to nanoLC/MS/MS, 2202 protein C-termini were identified with less than 3% contamination with internal peptides. We believe this is the largest coverage with the highest purity reported to date in human protein C-terminomics. This fast, simple, sensitive and selective method to isolate protein C-terminal peptides should be useful for profiling protein C-termini on a proteome-wide scale.",

    "abstract": "A more comprehensive understanding of how cells respond to drug intervention, the likely immediate signalling responses and how resistance may develop within different microenvironments allows us anticipate how cells adapt to targeted therapy enabling more informed prediction of rational drug combinations. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase SRC regulates many cellular signalling processes and pharmacological inhibition has long been a target of drug discovery projects for the treatment of cancer. Here we describe the in vitro and in vivo characterisation of the small molecule SRC inhibitor, AZD0424. We show that AZD0424 potently inhibits the phosphorylation of tyrosine-416 of SRC (IC50 [~] 100 nM) in many cancer cell lines; however inhibition of cell viability, via a G1 cell cycle arrest, was observed only in a sub-set of cancer cell lines in the low (on target) micromolar range. We profiled the changes in intracellular pathway signalling in cancer cells following exposure to AZD0424 and other targeted therapies using Reverse Phase Protein Array analysis. We demonstrate that SRC is activated in response to MEK inhibitor (trametinib or AZD6244)-treatment of KRAS mutant colorectal cell lines (HCT116 and DLD1) and that AZD0424 abrogates this. Cell lines treated with trametinib or AZD6244 in combination with AZD0424 revealed reduction of EGFR, FAK and SRC compensatory activation, and, synergistically inhibits cell viability in vitro. In vivo, trametinib-treatment of mice bearing HCT116 tumours increased phosphorylation of SRC on Tyr416, and when combined with AZD0424, inhibition of tumour growth is greater than trametinib alone. We also demonstrate that drug-induced resistance to trametinib is not re-sensitised by AZD0424 treatment in vitro, likely as a result of multiple compensatory signalling mechanisms; however inhibition of SRC remains an effective way to block invasion of trametinib resistant tumour cells. These data imply that inhibiting SRC may offer a useful addition to MEK inhibitor combination strategies.",

    "abstract": "Cholinergic interneurons (ChINs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been implicated in the acquisition and extinction of drug associations, as well as related plasticity in medium spiny neurons (MSNs). However, since most previous work has relied on artificial manipulations, if and how endogenous patterns of cholinergic signaling relate to drug associations is unknown. Moreover, despite great interest in the opposing effects of dopamine on MSN subtypes, whether ChIN-mediated effects are similar or different across MSN subtypes is also unknown. Here, we find that endogenous acetylcholine event frequency during extinction negatively correlates with the strength and persistence of cocaine-context associations across individuals, consistent with effects of artificial manipulation of ChIN activity during extinction. Moreover, ChIN activation during extinction produces a reduction in excitatory synaptic strength on both MSN subtypes, similar to the effect of multiple extinction sessions in the absence of ChIN manipulations. Together, our findings indicate that natural variation in NAc acetylcholine may contribute to individual differences in drug-context extinction by modulating glutamatergic presynaptic strength similarly at both D1R and D2R MSN subtypes.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=146 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/458113v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14b4cc1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9c5224org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d4bff3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1862150_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The population activity within each module is tightly coordinated and preserved across environments and behavioral states. Little is known, however, about the coordination of activity patterns across modules. We analyzed the joint activity patterns of hundreds of grid cells simultaneously recorded in animals that were foraging either in the light, when sensory cues could stabilize the representation, or in darkness, when such stabilization was disrupted. We found that the states of different grid modules are tightly coordinated, even in darkness, when the internal representation of position within the MEC deviates substantially from the true position of the animal. These findings suggest that internal brain mechanisms dynamically coordinate the representation of position in different modules, to ensure that grid cells jointly encode a coherent and smooth trajectory of the animal.",

    "abstract": "The development of new vaccine strategies, as well as our understanding of key processes that shape viral evolution and host antibody repertoires, rely on measuring multiple antibody responses against large panels of viruses. Given the enormous diversity of circulating virus strains and antibody responses, exhaustive testing of all antibody-virus interactions is infeasible. Even within individual studies with limited panels, exhaustive testing is not always done, and there is no common framework for combining information across studies with partially overlapping panels, especially when the assay type or host species differ. Results from prior studies have demonstrated that virus-antibody interactions can be characterized in a vastly simpler and lower-dimensional space, suggesting that relatively few measurements could accurately predict unmeasured antibody-virus interactions. Here, we apply matrix completion to several of the largest-scale studies for both influenza and HIV-1. We explore how prediction accuracy evolves as the number of available measurements changes and approximate the number of additional measurements necessary in several highly incomplete datasets (suggesting [~]250,000 measurements could be saved). In addition, we show how the method can combine disparate datasets, even when the number of available measurements is below the theoretical limit that guarantees successful prediction. This approach can be readily generalized to other viruses or more broadly to other low-dimensional biological datasets.\n\nSignificanceOne of the central problems in immunology is to characterize how our vast array of antibodies inhibits the diverse pathogens we encounter in our lives. In this work, we apply a well-studied mathematical technique called matrix completion that leverages patterns in partially-observed antibody-virus inhibition data to infer unmeasured interactions. We predict the results of tens of thousands of missing experiments in influenza and HIV-1 studies and quantify the expected error of our estimates. By harnessing matrix completion, future experiments could be designed that only collect a fraction of measurements, saving time and resources while maximizing the information gained.",

    "abstract": "Observational studies reveal substantial variability in microbiome composition across individuals. While some of this variability can be explained by external factors like environmental, dietary, and genetic differences between individuals, in this paper we show that for the model organism Drosophila melanogaster the process of microbiome assembly is inherently stochastic and contributes a baseline level of microbiome variability even among organisms that are identically reared, housed, and fed. In germ-free flies fed known combinations of bacterial species, we find that some species colonize more frequently than others even when fed at the same high concentration. We develop a new ecological technique that infers the presence of interactions between bacterial species based on their colonization odds in different contexts, requiring only presence/absence data from two-species experiments. We use a progressive sequence of probabilistic models, in which the colonization of each bacterial species is treated as an independent stochastic process, to reproduce the empirical distributions of colonization outcomes across experiments. We find that incorporating context-dependent interactions substantially improves the performance of the models. Stochastic, context-dependent microbiome assembly underlies clinical therapies like fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotic administration, and should inform the design of synthetic fecal transplants and dosing regimes.\n\nSignificance StatementIndividuals are constantly exposed to microbial organisms that may or may not colonize their gut microbiome, and newborn individuals assemble their microbiomes through a number of these acquisition events. Since microbiome composition has been shown to influence host physiology, a mechanistic understanding of community assembly has potentially therapeutic applications. In this paper we study microbiome acquisition in a highly-controlled setting using germ-free fruit flies inoculated with specific bacterial species at known abundances. Our approach revealed that acquisition events are stochastic, and the colonization odds of different species in different contexts encode ecological information about interactions. These findings have consequences for microbiome-based therapies like fecal microbiota transplantation that attempt to modify a persons gut microbiome by deliberately introducing foreign microbes.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\n\nHIV-1 replication is durably controlled in certain untreated HIV-1-infected individuals expressing particular human leukocyte antigens (HLA). These HLAs tag infected cells for elimination by presenting specific viral epitopes to CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL). In individuals expressing HLA-B27, CTLs primarily target the capsid protein (CA)-derived KK10 epitope. Selection of CA mutation R264K helps HIV-1 escape the CTL response but severely diminishes virus infectivity. Here we report that the R264K mutation-associated infectivity defect arises primarily from impaired viral DNA integration. Strikingly, selection of the compensatory CA mutation S173A or depletion of host cyclophilin A largely rescues the R264K-associated integration and infectivity defects. Collectively, our study reveals novel mechanistic insights into the fitness defect incurred by an HIV-1 variant escaping a CA-directed CTL response.",

    "abstract": "In this study we describe the major lithoheterotrophic and autotrophic processes in 21 microbial sponge-associated phyla using novel and existing genomic and transcriptomic datasets. We show that a single gene family, molybdenum-binding subunit of dehydrogenase (coxL), likely evolved to benefit both lithoheterotrophic and organoheterotrophic symbionts, through adaptation to different inorganic and organic substrates. We show the main microbial carbon fixation pathways in sponges are restricted to specialized symbiotic lineages within five phyla. We also propose that sponge symbionts, in particular Acidobacteria, are capable of assimilating carbon through anaplerotic processes. However, the presence of symbionts genomically capable of autotrophy does not inform on their actual contribution to light and dark carbon fixation. Using radioisotope assays we identified variability in the relative contributions of chemosynthesis to total carbon fixation in different sponge species. Furthermore, the symbiosis of sponges with two closely related Cyanobacteria results in outcomes that are not predictable by analysis of -omics data alone: Candidatus Synechococcus spongiarum contributes to the holobiont carbon budget by transfer of photosynthates, while Candidatus Synechococcus feldmannii does not. Our results highlight the importance of combining sequencing data with physiology to gain a broader understanding of carbon metabolism within holobionts characterized by highly diverse microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "A single region of the Pseudomonas putida genome, designated the flagellar cluster, includes 59 genes potentially involved in the biogenesis and function of the flagellar system. Here we combine bioinformatics and in vivo gene expression analyses to clarify the transcriptional organization and regulation of the flagellar genes in the cluster. We have identified eleven flagellar operons and characterized twenty-two primary and internal promoter regions. Our results indicate that synthesis of the flagellar apparatus and core chemotaxis machinery is regulated by a three-tier cascade in which fleQ is a Class I gene, standing at the top of the transcriptional hierarchy. FleQ- and{sigma} 54-dependent Class II genes encode most components of the flagellar structure, part of the chemotaxis machinery and multiple regulatory elements, including the flagellar{sigma} factor FliA. FliA activation of Class III genes enables synthesis of the filament, one stator complex and completion of the chemotaxis apparatus. Accessory regulatory proteins and an intricate operon architecture add complexity to the regulation by providing feedback and feed-forward loops to the main circuit. Because of the high conservation of the gene arrangement and promoter motifs, we believe that the regulatory circuit presented here may also apply to other environmental pseudomonads.\n\nORIGINALITY-SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThis is the first integrative study of the flagellar transcriptional cascade in Pseudomonas putida. Our results provide a new transcriptional organization featuring several operons with a nested architecture, detailed regulatory characterization of twenty-two flagellar promoters and a novel hierarchy for the regulatory circuit of the flagellar transcriptional cascade. The results presented represent a significant departure from previous models for other related bacteria. High conservation of flagellar gene organization and promoter sequences suggest that our observations may be relevant to other pseudomonads.",

Here, we highlighted the critical role of the cellular CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) both in the regulation of BLV transcriptional activities and in the deregulation of the tridimensional (3D) chromatin architecture surrounding the BLV integration site. We demonstrated the in vivo recruitment of CTCF to three conserved CTCF binding motifs along the BLV provirus. Next, we showed a critical role for CTCF in delimitating the epigenetic landscape along the BLV provirus as well as to repress the 5Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) promoter activity, thereby contributing to viral latency, while favoring the 3LTR promoter activity. Finally, we demonstrated that BLV integration deregulated host cellular 3D chromatin organization through the formation of abnormal viral/host chromatin loops.

Studying the interplay of m6A, alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation sites, poly(A) tail length, and non-A residues in poly(A) tails requires monitoring them simultaneously on one transcript, however strategies to achieve this are lacking. Therefore, we developed a new method, combining m6A-specific methylated RNA immunoprecipitation and the PacBio-based, tail-included, full-length RNA sequencing approach PAIso-seq2, which weve named m6A and poly(A) inclusive RNA isoform sequencing 2 (MePAIso-seq2). Using MePAIso-seq2, we revealed that m6A promotes and inhibits a similar number of alternative splicing events in mouse cell lines, showing that m6A does affect alternative splicing. In contrast, no correlation was detected between m6A and alternative polyadenylation sites choice. Surprisingly, we found that m6A-modified RNAs possess longer poly(A) tails and a lower proportion of poly(A) tails containing non-A residues, especially in mouse embryonic stem cells. Together, we developed a new method to detect full-length m6A-modified RNAs to comprehensively study the relationships between m6A, alternative splicing, and poly(A) tailing, laying a foundation for further exploration of the functional coordination of different RNA post-transcriptional modifications.",

    "abstract": "Foodborne illness undermines human health by causing fever, stomachache and even lethality. Among foodborne bacterial pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are of extraordinary significance which drive reasons of food and beverage poisoning in numerous cases. Today, PCR has been widely used to examine the presence of different foodborne pathogens. However, PCR requires specialized equipment and skillful personnel which limit its application in the field. Recently, there is an emerging of isothermal PCR methods in which the reactions occur at low and constant temperature, allowing their application in restricted-resource settings. In this work, multiplex Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) was used to simultaneously detect S. aureus and P. aeruginosa with high sensitivity and specificity. The limit detection of multiplex RPA was 10 and 30 fg/reaction of genomic DNAs of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Besides, the reaction time was reduced to only 25 minutes with a low incubation temperature of 39 {degrees}C. Markedly, multiplex RPA reactions succeeded to directly detect as low as 1 and 5 CFU/reaction of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa cells, respectively without the requirement of extracting DNA genome. Moreover, the multiplex RPA reliably detected the two foodborne bacteria in milk, fruit juice and bottled water samples. In general, the direct multiplex RPA described in this study is a rapid, simple, sensitive and efficient alternative tool that could be used to detect the presence of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa without the necessity of costly devices and high-trained staff.",

    "abstract": "Non-templated poly(A) tails are added to the 3'-end of most mRNAs, which have important roles in post-transcriptional regulation1-3. Recent studies have revealed that poly(A) tails are not composed purely of A residues, but also contain U, C and G residues internally and at their 3'-ends4-6, revealing new levels of complexity. However, no method is able to analyze these internal and terminal non-A residues simultaneously. Here, we developed a new method called unbiased capture of 3-terminal followed by full-length RNA sequencing (UCTF-seq) which captures RNA 3'-ends by direct 3' adaptor ligation and rRNA removal by CRISPR/Cas9. This method allows simultaneous evaluation of the poly(A) tail length and 5'-end, internal, and 3'-end non- A residues together with the full-length cDNA for a transcript. Applying this method, we achieved the first complete transcriptome-wide 3' tail map of mRNA within the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of mammalian cells, uncovering differences in poly(A) tail length and non-A residues between these two mRNA populations. A survey of diverse eukaryotic species revealed the conservation of a subset of poly(A) tails containing consecutive U residues in the internal positions, whereas those with consecutive C or G residues were of much lower abundance. Together, we established the first method to be able to comprehensively analyze poly(A) tail 5'-end, internal and 3'-end non-A residues in addition to the length simultaneously, and reveal the first complete mRNA 3' tail map, providing rich insights into the regulatory roles of poly(A) tails.",

Over a thousand phosphosites were dynamic in vivo, and assignment of cell cycle phases using egg extracts revealed hundreds of S-phase phosphorylations. Targeted phosphoproteomics in single embryos showed switch-like mitotic phosphorylation of diverse protein complexes. The majority of cell cycle-regulated phosphosites occurred in CDK consensus motifs, and 72% located to intrinsically disordered regions. Dynamically phosphorylated proteins, and documented substrates of cell cycle kinases, are significantly more disordered than phosphoproteins in general. Furthermore, 30-50% are components of membraneless organelles.

    "abstract": "Regeneration is a widely observed phenomenon by which the integrity of an organism is recovered after damage. So far, studies on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of regeneration have been limited to a handful of model multicellular organisms. Here, we systematically surveyed the regeneration ability of marine macroalgae (Rhodophyta, Phaeophyceae, Chlorophyta) after thallus severing and applied live cell microscopy on them to uncover the cellular response to the damage. We observed three types of responses - budding, rhizoid formation and/or sporulation - in 25 species among 66 examined, demonstrating the high potential of regeneration of macroalgae. In contrast, callus formation, which often accompanies plant regeneration, was never observed. We monitored the cellular and nuclear dynamics during cell repair or rhizoid formation of four phylogenetically diverged Rhodophyta and Chlorophyta species (Colaconema sp., Dasya sessilis, Cladophora albida, Codium fragile). We observed tip growth of the cells near the damaged site as a common response, despite the difference in the number of nuclei and cells across species. Nuclear translocation follows tip growth, enabling overall uniform distribution of multinuclei (Dasya sessilis, Cladophora albida, Codium fragile) or central positioning of the mononucleus (Colaconema sp.). In contrast, the control of cell cycle events, such as nuclear division and septation, varied in these species. In Dasya sessilis, the division of multinuclei was synchronised, whereas it was not the case in Cladophora albida. Septation was tightly coupled with nuclear division in Colaconema and Dasya but not in others. These observations show that marine macroalgae utilise a variety of regeneration pathways, with some common features. This study also provides a novel methodology of live cell biology in macroalgae, offering a foundation for the future of this under-studied taxon.",

Recent evidence demonstrates that microglia modulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis by inhibiting cell proliferation of neural precursors and survival both in vitro and in vivo, thus maintaining a balance between cell division and cell death in the neural stem cell pool. There are increasing reports suggesting these microglia found in neurogenic niches differ from their counterparts in non-neurogenic areas. Here, we present evidence that microglia in the hippocampal neurogenic niche are a specialized population that express genes known to regulate neurogenesis. By comprehensively profiling myeloid lineage cells in the hippocampus using single cell RNA-sequencing, we resolve transcriptomic differences in microglia originating from the subgranular zone. These cells have lower expression of genes associated with homeostatic microglia and increased expression of genes associated with phagocytosis. Intriguingly, this small yet distinct population expresses a gene signature with substantial overlap with previously characterized phenotypes, including disease associated microglia (DAM), a particularly unique and compelling microglial state.",

    "abstract": "The nascent mRNA transcribed in the nucleus is cleaved and polyadenylated before it is transported to the cytoplasm for translation1. Polyadenylation can also occur in the cytoplasm for post-transcriptional regulation, especially in neurons, oocytes and early embryos1,2. Recently, we revealed transcriptome-wide maternal mRNA cytoplasmic re-polyadenylation during the mammalian oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET)3-6. However, the mechanism of re-polyadenylation during mammalian OET, including the sites to be re-polyadenylated and the enzymes involved, is still poorly understood. Here, by analyzing the PAIso-seq1 and PAIso-seq2 poly(A) inclusive transcriptome data during OET in mice, rats, pigs, and humans, we reveal conserved re-polyadenylation of mRNA degradation intermediates. These re-polyadenylated mRNA degradation intermediates account for over half of the polyadenylated mRNA during OET in all four species. We find that mRNA degradation intermediates for re-polyadenylation are generated through Btg4-mediated deadenylation in both mouse and human. Interestingly, the poly(A) tails on the re-polyadenylated mRNA degradation intermediates are of different lengths and contain different levels of non-A residues compared to regular polyadenylation sites, suggesting specific regulation and function of these poly(A) tails in mammalian OET. Together, our findings reveal the maternal mRNA degradation intermediates as substrates for conserved cytoplasmic dominant re-polyadenylation during mammalian OET, and uncover the mechanism of production of these mRNA degradation intermediates. These findings provide new insights into mRNA post-transcriptional regulation, and a new direction for the study of mammalian OET.",

As there is no widely accepted benchmark dataset to compare scoring models, we present a curated \"TrueOT\" dataset that contains thoroughly validated datapoints to best reflect the properties of in vivo editing. Many existing models are trained on data from high throughput assays. We hypothesize that such models may suboptimally transfer to the low throughput data in TrueOT due to fundamental biological differences between proxy assays and in vivo behavior. We developed new Siamese convolutional neural networks, trained them on a proxy dataset, and compared their performance against existing models on TrueOT.\n\nResultsOur simplest model with a single convolutional and pooling layer surprisingly exhibits state-of-the-art performance on TrueOT. Adding subsequent layers improved performance on a proxy dataset while compromising performance on TrueOT. We demonstrate improved generalization on TrueOT with a Siamese model of higher complexity when we apply transfer learning techniques. These results suggest an urgent need for the CRISPR community to agree upon a benchmark dataset such as TrueOT and highlight that various sources of CRISPR data cannot be assumed to be equivalent.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationOur code base and datasets are available on GitHub at github.com/baolab-rice/CRISPR_OT_scoring.",

    "abstract": "Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a serine-threonine protein kinase and important regulator of the DNA damage response (DDR). One critical ATM target is the structural subunit A (PR65) of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), known to regulate diverse cellular processes such as mitosis and cell growth as well as dephosphorylating many proteins during the recovery from the DDR. We generated mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing PR65-WT, -S401A (cannot be phosphorylated), and -S401D (phosphomimetic) transgenes. Significantly, S401 mutants exhibited extensive chromosomal aberrations, impaired DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and underwent increased mitotic catastrophe after radiation. Our study demonstrates that the phosphorylation of a single, critical PR65 amino acid (S401) by ATM fundamentally controls the DDR, and balances DSB repair quality, cell survival and growth by spatiotemporal PR65 nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling mediated by the nuclear export receptor CRM1.",

    "abstract": "Fungal interactions with plant roots, either beneficial or detrimental, have a major impact on agriculture and ecosystems. The soil inhabiting ascomycete Fusarium oxysporum (Fo) constitutes a species complex of worldwide distribution causing vascular wilt in more than a hundred different crops. Individual isolates of the fungus exhibit host-specific pathogenicity, determined by proteinaceous effectors termed secreted in xylem (SIX). However, such isolates can also colonize roots of non-host plants asymptomatically as endophytes, or even protect them against pathogenic isolates. The molecular determinants of multi-host plant colonization are currently unknown. Here, we identified a set of fungal effectors termed ERCs (Early Root Compatibility effectors), which are secreted during early biotrophic growth of Fo on both host and non-host plants. In contrast to the strain-specific SIX effectors, which are encoded on accessory genomic regions, ERCs are encoded on core regions and are found across the entire Fo species complex as well as in other phytopathogens, suggesting a conserved role in fungus-plant associations. Targeted deletion of ERC genes in a pathogenic Fo isolate resulted in reduced virulence on the host plant and rapid activation of plant immune responses, while in a non-pathogenic isolate it led to impaired root colonization and loss of biocontrol ability. Strikingly, some ERCs also contribute to Fo infection on the non-vascular land plant Marchantia polymorpha. Our results reveal an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for multi-host colonization by root infecting fungi.",

    "abstract": "Natural proteins represent numerous but tiny structure/function islands in a vast ocean of possible protein sequences, most of which has not been explored by either biological evolution or research. Recent studies have suggested this uncharted sequence space possesses surprisingly high structural propensity, but development of an understanding of this phenomenon has been awaiting a systematic high-throughput approach.\n\nHere, we designed, prepared, and characterized two combinatorial protein libraries consisting of randomized proteins, each 105 residues in length. The first library constructed proteins from the entire canonical alphabet of 20 amino acids. The second library used a subset of only 10 residues (A,S,D,G,L,I,P,T,E,V) that represent a consensus view of plausibly available amino acids through prebiotic chemistry. Our study shows that compact conformations resistant to proteolysis are (i) abundant (up to 40%) in random sequence space, (ii) independent of general Hsp70 chaperone system activity, and (iii) not granted solely by \"late\" and complex amino acid additions. The Hsp70 chaperone system effectively increases solubility and refoldability of the canonical alphabet but has only a minor impact on the \"early\" library. The early alphabet proteins are inherently more soluble and refoldable, possibly assisted by the cell-like environment in which these assays were performed.\n\nOur work indicates that both early and modern amino acids are predisposed to supporting protein structure (either in forms of oligomers or globular/molten globule structures) and that protein structure may not be a unique outcome of evolution.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is highly effective in alleviating movement disability in patients with Parkinsons disease (PD). However, its therapeutic mechanism of action is unknown. The healthy striatum exhibits rich dynamics resulting from an interaction of beta, gamma and theta oscillations. These rhythms are at the heart of selection, initiation and execution of motor programs, and their loss or exaggeration due to dopamine (DA) depletion in PD is a major source of the behavioral deficits observed in PD patients. Interrupting abnormal rhythms and restoring the interaction of rhythms as observed in the healthy striatum may then be instrumental in the therapeutic action of DBS. We develop a biophysical networked model of a BG pathway to study how abnormal beta oscillations can emerge throughout the BG in PD, and how DBS can restore normal beta, gamma and theta striatal rhythms. Our model incorporates STN projections to the striatum, long known but understudied, that were recently shown to preferentially target fast spiking interneurons (FSI) in the striatum. We find that DBS in STN is able to normalize striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) activity by recruiting FSI dynamics, and restoring the inhibitory potency of FSIs observed in normal condition. We also find that DBS allows the re-expression of gamma and theta rhythms, thought to be dependent on high DA levels and thus lost in PD, through cortical noise control. Our study shows how BG connectivity can amplify beta oscillations, and delineates the role of DBS in disrupting beta oscillations and providing corrective input to STN efferents to restore healthy striatal dynamics. It also suggests how gamma oscillations can be leveraged to enhance or supplement DBS treatment and improve its effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Muller cells are the main macroglial cells of the retina exerting a wealth of functions to maintain retinal homoeostasis. Upon pathological changes in the retina, they become gliotic with both protective and detrimental consequences. Accumulating data also provide evidence for a pivotal role of Muller cells in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). While microglial cells, the resident immune cells of the retina are considered as main players in inflammatory processes associated with DR, the implication of activated Muller cells in chronic retinal inflammation remains to be elucidated. In order to assess the signaling capacity of Muller cells and their role in retinal inflammation, we performed in-depth proteomic analysis of Muller cell proteomes and secretomes after stimulation with INF{gamma}, TNF, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, VEGF, TGF{beta}1, TGF{beta}2 and TGF{beta}3. We used both, primary porcine Muller cells and the human Muller cell line MIO-M1 for our hypothesis generating approach. Our results point towards an intense signaling capacity of Muller cells, which reacted in a highly discriminating manner upon treatment with different cytokines. Stimulation of Muller cells resulted in a primarily pro-inflammatory phenotype with secretion of cytokines and components of the complement system. Furthermore, we observed evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction, implying oxidative stress after treatment with the various cytokines. Finally, both MIO-M1 cells and primary porcine Muller cells showed several characteristics of atypical antigen-presenting cells, as they are capable of inducing MHC class I and MHC class II with co-stimulatory molecules. In line with this, they express proteins associated with formation and maturation of phagosomes. Thus, our findings underline the importance of Muller cell signaling in the inflamed retina, indicating an active role in chronic retinal inflammation underlying the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.",

    "abstract": "Cnidocytes (\"stinging cells\") are an unequivocally novel cell type used by cnidarians (corals, jellyfish, and their kin) to immobilize prey. Although they are known to share a common evolutionary origin with neurons, the developmental program that promoted the emergence of cnidocyte fate is not known. Using functional genomics in the sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis, we show that cnidocytes evolved by suppression of neural fate in a subset of neurons expressing RFamide. We further show that a single regulatory gene, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor (ZNF845), coordinates both the gain of novel (cnidocyte-specific) traits and the inhibition of ancestral (neural) traits during cnidocyte development and that this gene arose by domain shuffling in the stem cnidarian. Thus, we uncover a mechanism by which a truly novel regulatory gene (ZNF845) promoted the origin of a truly novel cell type (cnidocyte) through duplication of an ancestral cell lineage (neuron) and inhibition of its ancestral identity (RFamide).\n\nSignificanceIn this study, we demonstrate how new cell types can arise in animals through duplication of an ancestral (old) cell type followed by functional divergence of the new daughter cell. Specifically, we show that stinging cells in cnidarians (jellyfish and corals) evolved by duplication of an ancestral neuron followed by inhibition of the RFamide neuropeptide it once secreted. This is the first evidence that stinging cells evolved from a specific subtype of neurons and suggests some neurons may be easier to co-opt for novel functions than others.",

    "abstract": "ELT-2 is the major transcription factor required for Caenorhabditis elegans intestinal development. ELT-2 expression initiates in embryos to promote development and then persists after hatching through the larval and adult stages. Though the sites of ELT-2 binding are characterized and the transcriptional changes that result from ELT-2 depletion are known, an intestine-specific transcriptome profile spanning developmental time has been missing. We generated this dataset by performing Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) on intestine cells at distinct developmental stages. We analyzed this dataset in conjunction with previously conducted ELT-2 studies to evaluate the role of ELT-2 in directing the intestinal gene regulatory network through development. We found that only 33% of intestine-enriched genes in the embryo were direct targets of ELT-2 but that number increased to 75% by the L3 stage. This suggests additional transcription factors promote intestinal transcription especially in the embryo. Furthermore, only half of ELT-2s direct target genes were dependent on ELT-2 for their proper expression levels, and an equal proportion of those responded to elt-2 depletion with over-expression as with under-expression. That is, ELT-2 can either activate or repress direct target genes. Additionally, we observed that ELT-2 repressed its own promoter, implicating new models for its autoregulation. Together, our results illustrate that ELT-2 impacts roughly 20 - 50% of intestine-specific genes, that ELT-2 both positively and negatively controls its direct targets, and that the current model of the intestinal regulatory network is incomplete as the factors responsible for directing the expression of many intestinal genes remain unknown.",
