    "abstract": "The material properties of muscle play a central role in how muscle resists joint motion, transmits forces internally, and repairs itself. While many studies have evaluated muscles tensile material properties, few have investigated muscles shear properties. None of which have taken into account muscles anisotropic structure or investigated how different muscle architecture affect muscles shear properties. The objective of this study was to quantify the shear moduli of skeletal muscle in three orientations relevant to the function of whole muscle. We collected data from the extensor digitorum longus, tibialis anterior, and soleus harvested from both hindlimbs of 12 rats. These muscles were chosen to further evaluate the consistency of shear moduli across muscles with different architectures. We calculated the shear modulus in three orientations: parallel, perpendicular, and across with respect to muscle fiber alignment; while the muscle was subjected to increasing shear strain. For all muscles and orientations, the shear modulus increased with increasing strain. The shear modulus measured perpendicular to fibers was greater than in any other orientation. Despite architectural differences between muscles, we did not find a significant effect of muscle type on shear modulus. Our results show that in rat, muscles shear moduli vary with respect to fiber orientation and are not influenced by architectural differences in muscles.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria regulate their cellular resource allocation to enable fast growth-adaptation to a variety of environmental niches. We studied the ribosomal allocation, growth and expression profiles of two sets of fast-growing mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 in glucose minimal medium. Mutants with only 3 of the seven copies of ribosomal RNA operons grew faster than the wild-type strain in minimal media and show similar phenotype to previously studied rpoB mutants. Higher growth rates due to increased ribosome content affected resource allocation. Expression profiles of fast-growing mutants shared downregulation of hedging functions and upregulated growth functions. Mutants showed longer diauxic shifts and reduced activity of gluconeogenic promoters during glucose-acetate shifts, suggesting reduced availability of the RNA Polymerase for expressing hedging proteome. These results show that the regulation of ribosomal allocation underlies the growth/hedging phenotypes obtained from laboratory evolution experiments. We show how two different regulatory perturbations (rRNA promoters or rpoB mutations) reshape the proteome for growth with a concomitant fitness cost\n\nHighlightsMutants with only 3 ribosomal operons grow faster than wild-type in minimal medium\n\n {Delta}4 rrn and rpoB mutants share phenotypic traits\n\nFaster growth of mutants is achieved by increased ribosome content\n\nFast-growing mutants display reduced hedging expression and adaptation trade-offs\n\nDespite similar ribosomal content in rich medium the mutants present growth defects",

    "abstract": "Long-noncoding RNA (lncRNA) comprise a new class of genes that have been assigned key roles in development and disease. Many lncRNAs are specifically transcribed in the brain where they regulate the expression of protein-coding genes that underpin neuronal function; however, their role in learning and memory remains largely unexplored. We used RNA Capture-Seq to identify a large population of lncRNAs that are expressed in the infralimbic cortex of adult male mice in response to fear-related learning, with 14.5% of these annotated in the GENCODE database as lncRNAs with no known function. We combined these data with cell-type-specific ATAC-seq on neurons that had been selectively activated by fear-extinction learning, and revealed 434 lncRNAs derived from enhancer regions in the vicinity of protein-coding genes. In particular, we discovered an experience-induced lncRNA called ADRAM that acts as both a scaffold and a combinatorial guide to recruit the brain-enriched chaperone protein 14-3-3 to the promoter of the memory-associated immediate early gene Nr4a2. This leads to the expulsion of histone deactylases 3 and 4, and the recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase creb binding protein, which drives learning-induced Nr4a2 expression. Knockdown of ADRAM disrupts this interaction, blocks the expression of Nr4a2, and ultimately impairs the formation of fear-extinction memory. This study expands the lexicon of experience-dependent lncRNA activity in the brain, highlights enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs) as key players in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression associated with fear extinction, and suggests eRNAs, such as ADRAM, may constitute viable targets in developing novel treatments for fear-related anxiety disorders.",

    "abstract": "RationaleThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) while functioning as a gatekeeper of the brain, impedes cerebral drug delivery. An emerging technology to overcome this limitation is focused ultrasound (FUS). When FUS interacts with intravenously injected microbubbles (FUS+MB), the BBB opens, transiently allowing the access of therapeutic agents into the brain. However, the ultrasound parameters need to be tightly tuned: when the acoustic pressure is too low there is no opening, and when it is too high, bleeds can occur. We therefore asked whether BBB permeability can be increased by combining FUS+MB with a second modality such that in a clinical setting lower acoustic pressures could be potentially used.\n\nMethodsGiven that FUS achieves BBB opening by the disruption of tight junction (TJ) proteins such as claudin-5 of brain endothelial cells, we generated a stable MDCK II cell line (eGFP-hCldn5-MDCK II) that expresses fluorescently tagged human claudin-5. Two claudin-5 binders, mC5C2 (a peptide) and cCPEm (a truncated form of an enterotoxin), that have been reported previously to weaken the barrier, were synthesized and assessed for their abilities to enhance the permeability of cellular monolayers. We then performed a comparative analysis of single and combination treatments.\n\nResultsWe successfully generated a novel cell line that formed functional monolayers as validated by an increased transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) reading and a low (< 0.2%) permeability to sodium fluorescein (376 Da). We found that the binders exerted a time- and concentration-dependent effect on BBB opening when incubated over an extended period, whereas FUS+MB caused a rapid barrier opening followed by recovery after 12 hours within the tested pressure range. Importantly, preincubation with cCPEm prior to FUS+MB treatment resulted in greater barrier opening compared to either FUS+MB or cCPEm alone as measured by reduced TEER values and an increased permeability to fluorescently labelled 40 kDa dextran (FD40).\n\nConclusionThe data suggest that pre-incubation with clinically suitable binders to TJ proteins may be a general strategy to facilitate safer and more effective ultrasound-mediated BBB opening in cellular and animal systems and potentially also for the treatment of human diseases of the brain.",

The benefits of various types of bokashi on soil fertility and plant growth are well documented, however the changes in microbial community composition and nutrients during bokashi maturation remain poorly characterized. Here, we aimed to identify potential differences in the quality of bokashi made using different ingredients and to investigate the biochemical transformation and microbial community succession of bokashi throughout the maturation process. We compared the effects of these different types of bokashi on the growth of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and kale (Brassica napus subsp. pabularia) seedlings, measured concentrations of NH4+ and PO43-, and characterized the bokashi bacterial and fungal communities over a 12-day maturation period. We found that cucumber and kale plants growing in all types of bokashi-amended soils exhibited increased chlorophyll levels and dry biomass. During bokashi maturation, we observed a decrease in available PO43-, and an increase in NH4+. There also appeared to be an increase in relative abundances of decomposers and beneficial microbes and a decrease in putative plant pathogens. Regardless of starting bokashi ingredients and differences in microbial composition and nutrient trends, all types of bokashi similarly improve plant growth and contain beneficial microbes.",

    "abstract": "Predator-prey interactions influence prey traits through both consumptive and non-consumptive effects, and variation in these traits can shape vector-borne disease dynamics. Meta-analysis methods were employed to generate predation effect sizes by different categories of predators and mosquito prey. This analysis showed that multiple families of aquatic predators are effective in consumptively reducing mosquito survival, and that the survival of Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex mosquitoes is negatively impacted by consumptive effects of predators. Mosquito larval size was found to play a more important role in explaining the heterogeneity of consumptive effects from predators than mosquito genus. Mosquito survival and body size were reduced by non-consumptive effects of predators, but development time was not significantly impacted. In addition, Culex vectors demonstrated predator avoidance behavior during oviposition. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that predators limit disease transmission by reducing both vector survival and vector size, and that associations between drought and human West Nile virus cases could be driven by the vector behavior of predator avoidance during oviposition. These findings are likely to be useful to infectious disease modelers who rely on vector traits as predictors of transmission.",

The spatiotemporal dynamics of these interactions dictate their functional consequences; therefore, there is great interest in facile methods for defining the sites of DPI within cells. Here, we present a general method for mapping DPI sites in vivo using the double stranded DNA-specific cytosine deaminase toxin DddA. Our approach, which we term DddA-sequencing (3D-seq), entails generating a translational fusion of DddA to a DNA binding protein of interest, inactivating uracil DNA glycosylase, modulating DddA activity via its natural inhibitor protein, and DNA sequencing for genome-wide DPI detection. We successfully applied this method to three Pseudomonas aeruginosa transcription factors that represent divergent protein families and bind variable numbers of chromosomal locations. 3D-seq offers several advantages over existing technologies including ease of implementation and the possibility to measure DPIs at single-cell resolution.",

    "abstract": "The recent development and application of methods based on the general principle of \"crosslinking and proximity ligation\" (crosslink-ligation) are revolutionizing RNA structure studies in living cells. However, extracting structure information from such data presents unique challenges. Here we introduce a set of computational tools for the systematic analysis of data from a wide variety of cross-link-ligation methods, specifically focusing on read mapping, alignment classification and clustering. We design a new strategy to map short reads with irregular gaps at high sensitivity and specificity. Analysis of previously published data reveals distinct properties and bias caused by the crosslinking reactions. We perform rigorous and exhaustive classification of alignments and discover 8 types of arrangements that provide distinct information on RNA structures and interactions. To deconvolve the dense and inter-twined gapped alignments, we develop a network/graph-based tool CRSSANT (Crosslinked RNA Secondary Structure Analysis using Network Techniques), which enables clustering of gapped alignments and discovery of new alternative and dynamic conformations. We discover that multiple crosslinking and ligation events can occur on the same RNA, generating multi-segment alignments to report complex high level RNA structures and multi-RNA interactions. We find that alignments with overlapped segments are produced from potential homodimers and develop a new method for their de novo identification. Analysis of overlapping alignments revealed potential new homodimers in cellular noncoding RNAs and RNA virus genomes in the Picornaviridae family. Together, this suite of computational tools enables rapid and efficient analysis of RNA structure and interaction data in living cells.",

    "abstract": "A link between Pro catabolism and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production has been established across eukaryotes and in plants increases in leaf respiration rates have been reported following Pro exposure. Here we investigated how alternative oxidases (AOXs) of the mitochondrial electron transport chain accommodate the large, atypical flux resulting from Pro catabolism and limit oxidative stress during Pro breakdown in mature Arabidopsis leaves. Following Pro treatment, AOX1a and AOX1d accumulate at transcript and protein levels, with AOX1d approaching the level of the typically dominant AOX1a isoform. We therefore sought to determine the function of both AOX isoforms under Pro respiring conditions. Oxygen consumption rate measurements in aox1a and aox1d leaves suggested these AOXs can functionally compensate for each other to establish enhanced AOX catalytic capacity in response to Pro. Generation of aox1a.aox1d lines showed complete loss of AOX proteins and activity upon Pro treatment, yet full respiratory induction in response to Pro remained possible via the cytochrome pathway. However, aox1a.aox1d leaves suffered increased levels of oxidative stress and damage during Pro metabolism compared to WT or the single mutants. During recovery from salt stress, when high rates of Pro catabolism occur naturally, photosynthetic rates in aox1a.aox1d recovered slower than WT or the single aox lines, showing that both AOX1a and AOX1d are beneficial for cellular metabolism during Pro drawdown following osmotic stress. This work provides physiological evidence of a beneficial role for AOX1a but also the less studied AOX1d isoform in allowing safe catabolism of alternative respiratory substrates like Pro.\n\nOne sentence summaryThe alternative oxidase of plant mitochondria contributes to Pro catabolism by preventing oxidative stress in the electron transport chain and this aids recovery of leaf metabolic rates following salinity stress.",

    "abstract": "Plants must respond to various seasonally changing environmental stimuli. In a previous study, seasonally oscillating genes were identified by a massive time-series transcriptome analysis for the wild population of Arabidopsis halleri ssp. gemmifera, a sister species to Arabidopsis thaliana. It was not clear how environmental stimuli shaped the seasonal expression pattern of these seasonally oscillating genes. In this study we show that responses in different time-scales contributed to the formation of seasonal expression patterns for several genes. To analyze the seasonally oscillating genes, we established an experimental system to mimic seasonal expression trends using A. thaliana and a \"smart growth chamber mini,\" a hand-made low-cost small chamber. Arabidopsis thaliana plants were cultured under conditions that mimicked the average monthly temperatures and daylengths under different day-scale incubation. In total, the seasonal trends of 1627 seasonally oscillating genes were mimicked, and they showed varying temporal responses (constant, transient, and incremental) to environmental stimuli. Our results suggest that plants perceive and integrate information regarding environmental stimuli in the field by combining seasonally oscillating genes with different temporal responsiveness.",

    "abstract": "Monocot DICER-LIKE3 (DCL3) and DCL5 produce distinct 24-nt heterochromatic small interfering RNAs (hc-siRNAs) and phased secondary siRNAs (phasiRNAs). The former small RNAs are linked to plant heterochromatin, and the latter to reproductive processes. It is assumed that these DCLs evolved from an ancient \"eudicot-type\" DCL3 ancestor, which may have produced both types of siRNAs. However, how functional differentiation was achieved after gene duplication remains elusive. Here, we find that monocot DCL3 and DCL5 exhibit biochemically distinct preferences for 3' overhangs and 5' phosphates, consistent with the structural properties of their in vivo double-stranded RNA substrates. Importantly, these distinct substrate specificities are determined by the PAZ domains of DCL3 and DCL5 which have accumulated mutations during the course of evolution. These data explain the mechanism by which these DCLs cleave their cognate substrates from a fixed end, ensuring the production of functional siRNAs. Our study also indicates how plants have diversified and optimized RNA silencing mechanisms during evolution.",

Naturally-occurring protein motifs and domains, including WWEs, PBZs, and macrodomains, act as \"readers\" for protein-linked ADPR. Although recombinant, antibody-like ADPR detection reagents containing these readers have facilitated the detection of ADPR, they are limited in their ability to capture the dynamic nature of ADPRylation. Herein, we describe and characterize a set of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) Trackers (PAR-Ts) - optimized dimerization-dependent or split-protein reassembly PAR sensors in which a naturally occurring PAR binding domain, WWE, was fused to both halves of dimerization-dependent GFP (ddGFP) or split Nano Luciferase (NanoLuc), respectively. We demonstrate that these new tools allow the detection and quantification of PAR levels in extracts, living cells, and living tissues with greater sensitivity, as well as temporal and spatial precision. Importantly, these sensors detect changes in cellular ADPR levels in response to physiological cues (e.g., hormone-dependent induction of adipogenesis without DNA damage), as well as xenograft tumor tissues in living mice.

    "abstract": "The interaction of plants with the complex microbial networks that inhabit them is important for plant health. While the reliance of plants on their microbial inhabitants for defense against invading pathogens is well documented, the acquisition of data concerning the relationships between plant developmental stage or aging, and microbiome assembly, is still underway. In this work, we observed developmental-age dependent changes in the phyllopshere microbiome of tomato. The plant hormone cytokinin (CK) regulates various plant growth and developmental processes. Here, we show that age-related shifts in microbiome content vary based on content of, or sensitivity to, CK. We observed a developmental age associated decline in microbial richness and diversity, accompanied by a decline in the presence of growth promoting and resistance inducing bacilli in the phyllosphere. This decline was absent from CK-rich or CK-hypersensitive genotypes. Bacillus isolates we obtained from CK rich genotypes were found to re-program the transcriptome to support morphogenesis and alter the leaf developmental program when applied to seedlings, and enhance yield and agricultural productivity when applied to mature plants. Our results support the notion that CK-dependent effects on microbiome content support developmental functions, suggesting that these are mediated by CK in part via the bacterial community.",

    "abstract": "Vascular endothelial cells (EC) form a critical interface between blood and tissues that maintains whole-body homeostasis. In COVID-19, disruption of the EC barrier results in edema, vascular inflammation, and coagulation, the hallmarks of the severe disease. However, the mechanisms by which EC are dysregulated in COVID-19 are unclear. Here, we show that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 alone activates the EC inflammatory phenotype in a manner dependent on integrin 5{beta}1 signaling. Incubation of human umbilical vein EC with whole spike, its receptor-binding domain, or the integrin-binding tripeptide RGD induced the nuclear translocation of NF-{kappa}B and enhanced the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules VCAM1 and ICAM1, the adhesion of peripheral blood leukocytes, and the permeability of the monolayer. Inhibitors of integrin 5{beta}1 activation prevented these effects. We suggest that the spike protein, through its RGD motif in the receptor-binding domain, binds to integrin 5{beta}1 in EC to activate Rho GTPases, eNOS pathways, and the NF-{kappa}B gene expression program responsible for vascular leakage and leukocyte infiltration, respectively. These findings uncover a new direct action of SARS-CoV-2 on EC dysfunction and introduce integrin 5{beta}1 as a promising target for treating vascular inflammation in COVID-19.",

Exploring the structure and dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, we argue that the high mutability characteristic of RNA viruses coupled with the remarkable flexibility and dynamics of viral proteins result in a substantial involvement of allosteric mechanisms. While allosteric effects of mutations should be considered in predictions and diagnostics of new VOCs, allosteric drugs advantageously avoid escaping mutations via non-competitive inhibition originating from many alternative distal locations. The exhaustive allosteric signalling and probing maps provide a comprehensive picture of allostery in the Spike protein, making it possible to locate sites of potential mutations that could work as new VOCs \"drivers\", and to determine binding patches that may be targeted by newly developed allosteric drugs.",

Conventionally, repertoire analysis methods have focused on comprehensive assessments of clonal compositions, including V(D)J segment usage, nucleotide insertions/deletions, and amino acid distributions. Here, we introduce a novel computational approach that applies deep-learning-based protein embedding techniques to analyze BCR repertoires. By selecting the most frequently occurring BCR sequences in a given repertoire and computing the sum of the vector representations of these sequences, we represent an entire repertoire as a 100-dimensional vector and eventually as a single data point in vector space. We demonstrate that this new approach enables us to not only accurately cluster BCR repertoires of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and healthy subjects but also efficiently track minute changes in immune status over time as patients undergo treatment. Furthermore, using the distributed representations, we successfully trained an XGBoost classification model that achieved a mean accuracy rate of over 87% given a repertoire of CDR3 sequences.",

We recently showed that this platform is highly inflammatory due to the LNPs ionizable lipid component. The inflammatory property is key to support the development of potent humoral immune responses. However, the mechanism by which this platform drives T follicular helper cells (Tfh) and humoral immune responses remains unknown. Here we show that lack of Langerhans cells or cDC1s neither significantly affected the induction of PR8 HA and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific Tfh cells and humoral immune responses, nor susceptibility towards the lethal challenge of influenza and SARS-CoV-2. However, the combined deletion of these two DC subsets led to a significant decrease in the induction of PR8 HA and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific Tfh cell and humoral immune responses. Despite these observed defects, the still high antibody titers were sufficient to confer protection towards lethal viral challenges. We further found that IL-6, but not neutrophils, was required to generate Tfh cells and antibody responses.\n\nIn summary, here we bring evidence that the mRNA-LNP platform can support protective adaptive immune responses in the absence of specific DC subsets through an IL-6 dependent and neutrophil independent mechanism.",

The virus has displayed a remarkable resistance to treatments and no drugs have been proved fully effective against Covid-19. Thus, despite the international efforts, there is still an urgent need for new potent and safe antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Here we exploited the enormous potential of plant metabolism using the bryophyte Marchantia polymorpha and identified a potent SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, following a bioactivity-guided fractionation and mass-spectrometry approach. We found that the chlorophyll derivative Pheophorbide a (PheoA), a porphyrin compound similar to animal Protoporphyrin IX, has an extraordinary antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 preventing infection of cultured monkey and human cells, without noticeable cytotoxicity. We also show that PheoA prevents coronavirus entry into the cells by directly targeting the viral particle. Besides SARS-CoV-2, PheoA also displayed a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against (+) strand RNA viral pathogens such as HCV, West Nile, and other coronaviruses, but not against (-) strand RNA viruses, such as VSV. Our results indicate that PheoA displays a remarkable potency and a satisfactory therapeutic index, which together with its previous use in photoactivable cancer therapy in humans, suggest that it may be considered as a potential candidate for antiviral therapy against SARS-CoV-2.",

Depending on the DNA sequence and concentration, the gel forms a periodic band pattern or contracts globally. Finally, we show that the structuration of the active gel can be spatially controlled in the presence of a gradient of DNA concentration.

    "abstract": "Site-specific recombination (SSR) is an important tool in genome editing and gene circuit design. However, its applications are limited by the inability to simply and predictably tune SSR reaction rates across orders of magnitude. Facile rate manipulation can in principle be achieved by modifying the nucleotide sequence of the DNA substrate of the recombinase, but the design principles for rationally doing so have not been elucidated. To enable predictable tuning of SSR reaction kinetics via DNA sequence, we developed an integrated experimental and computational method to parse individual nucleotide contributions to the overall reaction rate, which we used to analyze and engineer the DNA attachment sequence attP for the inversion reaction mediated by the serine recombinase Bxb1. A quantitative PCR method was developed to measure the Bxb1 reaction rate in vitro. Then, attP sequence libraries were designed, selected, and sequenced to inform a machine-learning model, which revealed that the Bxb1 reaction rate can be accurately represented assuming independent contributions of nucleotides at key positions. Next, we used the model to predict the performance of DNA site variants in reaction rate assays both in vitro and in Escherichia coli, with flipping rates ranging from 0.01- to 10-fold that of the wild-type attP sequence. Finally, we demonstrate that attP variants with predictable DNA recombination rates can be used in concert to achieve kinetic control in gene circuit design by coordinating the coexpression of two proteins in both their relative proportion and their total amount. Our high-throughput, data-driven method for rationally tuning SSR reaction rates through DNA sequence modification enhances our understanding of recombinase function and expands the synthetic biology toolbox.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Next generation sequencing has revealed the presence of many RNA viruses in animal reservoir hosts, including many closely related to known human pathogens. Despite their zoonotic potential, many of these viruses remain understudied due to not yet being cultured. While reverse genetic systems can facilitate virus rescue, this is often hindered by missing viral genome ends. A prime example is Lloviu virus (LLOV), an uncultured filovirus that is closely related to the highly pathogenic Ebola virus. Using minigenome systems, we complemented the missing LLOV genomic ends and identified cis-acting elements required for LLOV replication that were lacking in the published sequence. We leveraged these data to generate recombinant full-length LLOV clones and rescue infectious virus. Recombinant LLOV (rLLOV) displays typical filovirus features, as shown by electron microscopy. Known target cells of Ebola virus, including macrophages and hepatocytes, are permissive to rLLOV infection, suggesting that humans could be potential hosts.

    "abstract": "The  magic spot alarmones (pp)pGpp, previously implicated in Clostridioides difficile antibiotic survival, are synthesized by CdRSH and CdRelQ. These enzymes are transcriptionally activated by diverse environmental stresses, but both exclusively synthesize pGpp rather than ppGpp as has previously been reported. While direct synthesis of pGpp from a GMP substrate and (p)ppGpp hydrolysis into pGpp by NUDIX hydrolases have previously been reported, there is no precedent for a bacterium synthesizing pGpp exclusively. Hydrolysis of the 5 phosphate or pyrophosphate from GDP or GTP substrates is necessary for activity by the clostridial enzymes, neither of which can utilize GMP as a substrate. Both enzymes are remarkably insensitive to the size of their metal ion cofactor, tolerating a broad array of metals that do not allow activity in (pp)pGpp synthetases from other organisms. It is clear that while C. difficile utilizes magic spot signaling, its mechanisms of alarmone synthesis are not directly homologous to those in more completely characterized organisms.",

    "abstract": "Plasmids are genetic elements that disperse horizontally between different strains and species of bacteria and a major factor in the dissemination of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance. Understanding the ecology of plasmids has a notable anthropocentric value and therefore the interactions between bacterial hosts and individual plasmids have been studied in detail. However, bacterial systems often carry multiple genetically distinct plasmids, but dynamics of these multiplasmid \"clashes\" has remained unstudied. Here, we set to investigate the survival of 11 mobilizable or conjugative plasmids in five different ecological settings. The key incentive was to determine whether plasmid dynamics are reproducible and whether there are trade-offs in plasmid fitness that stem from the ecological situation of their initial hosts. Growth rates and maximum population densities increased in all communities and treatments over the 42-day evolution experiment although plasmid contents at the end varied notably. We show that large multiresistance conferring plasmids are unfit when the community also contains smaller plasmids with fewer resistance genes. This suggests that restraining the use to few antibiotics can make bacterial communities sensitive to others. The hosts also appear to react to the presence of multiple genetically different plasmids by enhancing fimbriae production instead of alleviating costs of individual plasmids. In general, the survivors of the here-studied multi-plasmid clash are significantly affected by the presence or absence of antibiotic selection and plasmid-free hosts of varying fitness. Therefore, these trade-offs in different settings can explain for example why some resistance plasmids have an advantage during a rapid proliferation of antibiotic sensitive pathogen whereas others dominate in alternative situations.",

    "abstract": "Methane metabolism is among the hallmarks of Archaea, originating very early in their evolution. Other than its two main complexes, methyl-CoM reductase (Mcr) and tetrahydromethanopterin-CoM methyltransferase (Mtr), there exist other genes called \"methanogenesis markers\" that are believed to participate in methane metabolism. Many of them are Domains of Unknown Function. Here we show that these markers emerged together with methanogenesis. Even if Mcr is lost, the markers and Mtr can persist resulting in intermediate metabolic states related to the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Beyond the markers, the methanogenic ancestor was hydrogenotrophic, employing the anaplerotic hydrogenases Eha and Ehb. The selective pressures acting on Eha, Ehb, and Mtr partially depend on their subunits membrane association. Integrating the evolution of all these components, we propose that the ancestor of all methane metabolizers was an autotrophic H2/CO2 methanogen that could perhaps use methanol but not oxidize alkanes. Hydrogen-dependent methylotrophic methanogenesis has since emerged multiple times independently, both alongside a vertically inherited Mcr or from a patchwork of ancient transfers. Through their methanogenesis genomic remnants, Thorarchaeota and two newly reconstructed order-level lineages in Archaeoglobi and Bathyarchaeota act as metabolically versatile players in carbon cycling of anoxic environments across the globe.",

    "abstract": "One strategy for a functional cure of HIV-1 is \"block and lock\", which seeks to permanently suppress the rebound of quiescent HIV-1 by epigenetic silencing. For the HIV LTR, both histone 3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) and DNA methylation are associated with viral suppression, while H3K4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) is correlated with viral expression. However, H3K27me3 is readily reversed upon activation of T-cells through the T-cell receptor. To suppress latent HIV-1 in a stable fashion, we depleted the expression or inhibited the activity of UTX/KDM6A, the major H3K27 demethylase, and investigated its impact on latent HIV-1 reactivation in T cells. Inhibition of UTX dramatically enhanced H3K27me3 levels at the HIV LTR and were associated with increased DNA methylation. In latently infected cells from patients, GSK-J4, which is a potent dual inhibitor of the H3K27me3/me2-demethylases JMJD3/KDM6B and UTX/KDM6A, effectively suppressed the reactivation of latent HIV-1 and induced DNA methylation at specific sites in the 5LTR of latent HIV-1 by the enhanced recruitment of DNMT3A to HIV-1. Nonetheless, suppression of HIV-1 through epigenetic silencing required the continued treatment with GSK-J4 and was rapidly reversed after removal of the drug. Thus, epigenetic silencing by itself appears to be insufficient to permanently silence HIV-1 proviral transcription.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe \"block and lock\" strategy for a functional HIV-1 cure is based on the premise that permanent inactivation of the HIV-1 can be achieved by epigenetic silencing of the proviral DNA. For cellular genes, long-term silencing is achieved during cell differentiation by the induction of specific epigenetic modifications involving histone and DNA methylation. During HIV-1 silencing, histone methylation and DNA methylation are observed, but both sets of modifications can be reversed upon activation of T-cells through the T-cell receptor or potent latency reversing agents. In an attempt to enhance silencing of HIV-1 transcription, we used an inhibitor of H3K27 demethylases to increase H3K27 methylation. This in turn led to enhanced DNA methylation of HIV-1. Unfortunately, although the treatment effectively silenced HIV-1 and prevented viral reactivation, the silencing effects were short-lived and quickly reversed after removal of the drug.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance mutations tend to disrupt key physiological processes, and therefore carry a fitness cost. The size of these fitness costs is a central determinant of the rate of spread of these mutations in natural populations so are important to quantify. Head-to-head competition assays provide a standard approach to measuring differential fitness, and have been used extensively for malaria parasites. These assays typically use standardized culture media, containing RPMI 1640, which has a 1.4 to 5.5-fold (mean: 2.6-fold) higher concentration of amino acids than human blood. In this rich media we predict that fitness costs will be underestimated because resource competition is weak. We tested this prediction using an artemisinin sensitive parasite edited to contain kelch-C580Y or R561H mutations conferring resistance to artemisinin or synonymous control mutations. We examined the impact of these single amino acid mutations on fitness, using replicated head-to head competition experiments conducted in media containing (i) normal RPMI, (ii) modified RPMI with reduced amino acid concentration, (iii) RPMI containing only isoleucine, or (iv) 3-fold diluted RPMI. We found a significant 1.3 to 1.4-fold increase in fitness costs measured in modified and isoleucine-only media relative to normal media, while fitness costs were 2.5-fold higher in diluted media. We conclude that fitness costs are strongly affected by media composition and will be significantly underestimated in normal RPMI. Elevated fitness costs in nature will limit spread of ART-resistance but will also promote evolution of compensatory mutations that restore fitness, and can be exploited to maximize selection in laboratory experiments.",

    "abstract": "TOP1MT encodes a mitochondrial topoisomerase that is important for mtDNA regulation, and that is involved in mitochondrial replication, transcription and translation. Two variants predicted to affect TOP1MT function (V1 - R198C and V2 - V338L) were identified by exome sequencing of a newborn with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. As no pathogenic TOP1MT variants had been confirmed previously, we characterized these variants for their ability to rescue several TOP1MT functions in knockout cells. Consistent with these TOP1MT variants contributing to the patient phenotype, comprehensive characterization suggests that both variants had impaired activity. Critically, neither variant was able to restore steady state levels of mitochondrial-encoded proteins, nor reduced oxidative phosphorylation when re-expressed in TOP1MT knockout cells. However, the two variants behaved differently in some respects. While the V1 variant was better at restoring transcript levels, the V2 variant was able to restore mtDNA copy number and replication. These findings suggest that the different TOP1MT variants affect distinct TOP1MT functions. Altogether, these findings begin to provide insight into the many roles that TOP1MT plays in the maintenance and expression of the mitochondrial genome, and how impairments in this important protein may lead to human pathology.",

MYC binds to specific E-box sequences in the genome to regulate gene expression in a cell type- and developmental stage-specific manner. To date, a comprehensive analysis of direct MYC targets with essential roles in different types of cancer is missing. To enable identification of functional MYC binding sites and corresponding target genes, we designed a CRISPR/Cas9 library to destroy E-box sequences in a genome-wide fashion. In parallel, we used the Brunello library to knockout protein-coding genes. We performed high-throughput screens with these libraries in four MYC-dependent cancer cell lines: K562, ST486, HepG2 and MCF7, which revealed several essential E-boxes and genes. Among them we pinpointed crucial known and novel MYC-regulated genes involved in pathways associated with cancer development. Extensive validation of our approach in K562 cells confirmed that E-box disruption affects MYC binding, target genes expression and cell proliferation. Our unique, well-validated tool opens new possibilities to gain novel insights into MYC-dependent vulnerabilities in cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Haemoglobin degradation is crucial for the growth and survival of Plasmodium falciparum in human erythrocytes. Although the process of Hb degradation has been studied in great detail, the mechanisms of Hb uptake remain ambiguous to date. Here, we characterized Heme Detoxification Protein (PfHDP), a protein localized in the parasitophorous vacuole, parasite food vacuole and infected erythrocyte cytosol for its role in Hb uptake. Immunoprecipitation of PfHDP-GFP fusion protein from a transgenic line using anti-GFP antibody and of Plasmodium parasite extract using anti-human Hb antibodies respectively, showed the association of PfHDP/Hb with each other as well as with the members of PTEX translocon complex. Some of these associations such as PfHDP/Hb and PfHDP/Pfexp-2 interactions were confirmed by in vitro protein-protein interaction tools. To know the roles of PfHDP and translocon complex in Hb import into the parasites, we next studied the Hb uptake by the parasite in PfHDP knock-down line using the GlmS ribozyme strategy. PfHDP knock-down significantly reduced the Hb uptake in these parasites in comparison to the wild type parasites. Further, the transient knock-down of one of the members of the translocon complex; PfHSP101 showed considerable reduction in Hb uptake. Morphological analysis of PfHDP-HA-GlmS transgenic parasites in the presence of GlcN showed food vacuole abnormalities and parasite stress, thereby causing a growth defect in the development of these parasites. Together, we implicate the translocon complex in the trafficking of PfHDP/Hb complex in the parasite and suggest a role for PfHDP in the uptake of Hb and parasite development. The study thus reveals new insights into the function of PfHDP, making it an extremely important target for developing new antimalarials.",

    "abstract": "The identification of cellular targets that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit, broadly known as target ID, remains a fundamental goal in drug discovery. In recent years, the application of new chemical and biological technologies that accelerate target ID has become commonplace within drug discovery programs, as a complete understanding of how molecules react in a cellular environment can lead to increased binding selectivity, improved safety profiles, and clinical efficacy. Established approaches using photoaffinity labelling (PAL) are often costly and time-consuming due to poor signal-to-noise coupled with extensive probe optimization. Such challenges are exacerbated when dealing with low abundance membrane proteins or multiple protein target engagement, typically rendering target ID unfeasible. Herein, we describe a general platform for photocatalytic small molecule target ID, which hinges upon the generation of high-energy carbene intermediates via visible light-mediated Dexter energy transfer. By decoupling the reactive warhead from the drug, catalytic signal amplification results in multiple labelling events per drug, leading to unprecedented levels of target enrichment. Through the development of cell permeable photo-catalyst conjugates, this method has enabled the quantitative target and off target identification of several drugs including (+)-JQ1, paclitaxel, and dasatinib. Moreover, this methodology has led to the target ID of two GPCRs - ADORA2A and GPR40 - a class of drug target seldom successfully uncovered in small molecule PAL campaigns.",

To better understand DNA methylome changes, methylation profiling was performed in human chondrocytes. This study reveals association between methylation of specific CpG sites and chondrocyte age. We also determined the putative binding targets of STAT3, a key age-patterned transcription factor in fetal chondrocytes and genetic ablation of STAT3 induced a global genomic hypermethylation. Moreover, an epigenetic clock built for adult human chondrocytes revealed that exposure of aged adult human chondrocytes to STAT3 agonist, decreased epigenetic age.

The continuing global impact of malaria reflects the evolutionary success of a complex vector-pathogen relationship that accordingly has been the long-term focus of both debate and study. An open question in the biology of malaria transmission is the impact of naturally occurring low-level Plasmodium infections of the vector on the mosquitos health and longevity as well as critical behaviors such as host- preference/seeking. To begin to answer this, we have completed a comparative RNAseq-based transcriptome profile study examining the effect of biologically salient, salivary gland transmission- stage Plasmodium infection on the molecular physiology of Anopheles gambiae s.s. head, sensory appendage, and salivary glands. When compared with their uninfected counterparts, Plasmodium infected mosquitoes exhibit increased transcript abundance of genes associated with olfactory acuity as well as a range of synergistic processes that align with increased fitness based on both anti-aging and reproductive advantages. Taken together, these data argue against the long-held paradigm that malaria infection is pathogenic for anophelines and, instead, suggests there are biological and evolutionary advantages for the mosquito that drive the preservation of its high vectorial capacity.",

It was previously shown that its export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is Crm1-dependent, yet neither the nuclear export signal (NES) nor the nuclear localization signal (NLS) has been identified. Here, we provide evidence for a noncanonical NLS in UPF1, map the NES to amino acids 89-105 and show that L103 and F105 are essential for UPF1s export to the cytoplasm.

Here, we reveal that IFT concentration at the base of the flagellum of Trypanosoma brucei is required for proper assembly of IFT trains. Using live cell imaging at high resolution and direct optical nanoscopy with axially localized detection (DONALD) of fixed trypanosomes, we demonstrate that IFT proteins are localised around the 9 doublet microtubules of the proximal portion of the transition zone, just on top of the transition fibres. Super-resolution microscopy and photobleaching studies reveal that knockdown of the RP2 transition fibre protein results in reduced IFT protein concentration and turnover at the base of the flagellum. This in turn is accompanied by a 4- to 8-fold drop in the frequency of IFT train injection. We propose that the flagellum base provides a unique environment to assemble IFT trains.",

    "abstract": "Iron is an essential nutrient in mammalian cell cultures, conventionally supplemented as iron-loaded transferrin (holotransferrin). The high cost of human transferrin represents a challenge for the large scale production of cell therapies, such as cultured red blood cells. We evaluated the use of deferiprone, a cell membrane-permeable drug for iron chelation therapy, as an iron carrier for erythroid cultures. Iron-loaded deferiprone (Def3{middle dot}Fe3+) at a concentration of 52mol/L could fully replace holotransferrin during erythroblast differentiation into reticulocytes, the erythroid differentiation stage with maximal iron requirements. Reticulocytes cultured in presence of Def3{middle dot}Fe3+ or holotransferrin (1000g/mL) were similar with respect to expression of cell-surface markers CD235a and CD49d, hemoglobin content, and oxygen association/dissociation. Def3{middle dot}Fe3+ also supported expansion of the erythroid compartment in vitro, except for the first stage when hematopoietic stem cells committed to erythroblasts, in which a reduced erythroblasts yield was observed. This suggests that erythroblasts acquired the potential to process Def3{middle dot}Fe3+ as iron source for biosynthesis pathways. Replacement of holotransferrin by Def3{middle dot}Fe3+ was also successful in cultures of six myeloid cell lines (MOLM13, NB4, EOL1, K562, HL60, ML2). These results suggest that iron-loaded deferiprone can partially replace holotransferrin in chemically defined medium formulations for the production of cultured reticulocytes and proliferation of selected myeloid cell lines. This would lead to a significant decrease in medium cost that would improve the economic perspectives of the large scale production of red blood cells for transfusion purposes.\n\nKey pointsO_LIHolotransferrin limitations in erythroid cultures lead to lower erythroblast yields, impaired maturation and low enucleation efficiencies.\nC_LIO_LIIron-loaded deferiprone can replace holotransferrin in erythroblast expansion and differentiation cultures.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe kinetoplastid protozoan Leishmania tropica mainly causes cutaneous leishmaniasis in humans in the Middle East, and relapse or treatment failure after treatment are common in this area. L. tropicas digenic life cycle includes distinct stages in the vector sandfly and the mammalian host. Sexual reproduction and genetic exchange appear to occur more frequently than in other Leishmania species. Understanding these processes is complicated by chromosome instability during cell division that yields aneuploidy, recombination and heterozygosity. This combination of rare recombination and aneuploid permits may reveal signs of hypothetical parasexual mating, where diploid cells fuse to form a transient tetraploid that undergoes chromosomal recombination and gradual chromosomal loss.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsThe genome-wide SNP diversity from 22 L. tropica isolates showed chromosome-specific runs of patchy heterozygosity and extensive chromosome copy number variation. All these isolates were collected during 2007-2017 in Sweden from patients infected in the Middle East and included isolates from a patient possessing two genetically distinct leishmaniasis infections three years apart with no evidence of re-infection. We found differing ancestries on the same chromosome (chr36) across multiple samples: matching the reference genome with few derived alleles, followed by blocks of heterozygous SNPs, and then by clusters of homozygous SNPs with specific recombination breakpoints at an inferred origin of replication. Other chromosomes had similar marked changes in heterozygosity at strand-switch regions separating polycistronic transcriptional units.\n\nConclusion/SignificanceThese large-scale intra- and inter-chromosomal changes in diversity driven by recombination and aneuploidy suggest multiple mechanisms of cell reproduction and diversification in L. tropica, including mitotic, meiotic and parasexual processes. It underpins the need for more genomic surveillance of Leishmania, to detect emerging hybrids that could spread more widely and to better understand the association between genetic variation and treatment outcome. Furthering our understanding of Leishmania genome evolution and ancestry will aid better diagnostics and treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L.tropica in the Middle East.\n\nAuthor SummaryCutaneous leishmaniasis is mainly caused by Leishmania tropica in the Middle East, where it is known for treatment failure and a need for prolonged and/or multiple treatments. Several factors affect the clinical presentation and treatment outcome, such as host genetic variability and specific immune response, as well as environmental factors and the vector species. Little is known about the parasite genome and its influence on treatment response. By analysing the genome of 22 isolates of L. tropica, we have revealed extensive genomic variation and a complex population structure with evidence of genetic exchange within and among the isolates, indicating a possible presence of sexual or parasexual mechanisms. Understanding the Leishmania genome better may improve future treatment and better understanding of treatment failure and relapse.",

    "abstract": "Advances in droplet-based single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) have dramatically increased throughput, allowing tens of thousands of cells to be routinely sequenced in a single experiment. In addition to cells, droplets capture cell-free \"ambient\" RNA predominately caused by lysis of cells during sample preparation. Samples with high ambient RNA concentration can create challenges in accurately distinguishing cell-containing droplets and droplets containing ambient RNA. Current methods to separate these groups often retain a significant number of droplets that do not contain cells - so called empty droplets. Additional to the challenge of identifying empty drops, there are currently no methods available to detect droplets containing damaged cells, which comprise of partially lysed cells - the original source of the ambient RNA. Here we describe DropletQC, a new method that is able to detect empty droplets, damaged, and intact cells, and accurately distinguish from one another. This approach is based on a novel quality control metric, the nuclear fraction, which quantifies for each droplet the fraction of RNA originating from unspliced, nuclear pre-mRNA. We demonstrate how DropletQC provides a powerful extension to existing computational methods for identifying empty droplets such as EmptyDrops. We have implemented DropletQC as an R package, which can be easily integrated into existing single cell analysis workflows.",

    "abstract": "Hydrothermal vents have been key to our understanding of the limits of life, and the metabolic and phylogenetic diversity of thermophilic organisms. Here we used environmental metagenomics combined with analysis of physico-chemical data and 16S rRNA amplicons to characterize the diversity, temperature optima, and biogeographic distribution of sediment-hosted microorganisms at the recently discovered Auka vents in the Gulf of California, the deepest known hydrothermal vent field in the Pacific Ocean. We recovered 325 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) representing 54 phyla, over 1/3 of the currently known phylum diversity, showing the microbial community in Auka hydrothermal sediments is highly diverse. Large scale 16S rRNA amplicon screening of 227 sediment samples across the vent field indicates that the MAGs are largely representative of the microbial community. Metabolic reconstruction of a vent-specific, deeply branching clade within the Desulfobacterota (Tharpobacteria) suggests these organisms metabolize sulfur using novel octaheme cytochrome-c proteins related to hydroxylamine oxidoreductase. Community-wide comparison of the average nucleotide identity of the Auka MAGs with MAGs from the Guaymas Basin vent field, found 400 km to the Northwest, revealed a remarkable 20% species-level overlap between vent sites, suggestive of long-distance species transfer and sediment colonization. An adapted version of a recently developed model for predicting optimal growth temperature to the Auka and Guaymas MAGs indicates several of these uncultured microorganisms could grow at temperatures exceeding the currently known upper limit of life. Extending this analysis to reference data shows that thermophily is a trait that has evolved frequently among Bacteria and Archaea. Combined, our results show that Auka vent field offers new perspectives on our understanding of hydrothermal vent microbiology.",

    "abstract": "The circadian clock system regulates multiple metabolic processes, including bone metabolism. Previous studies have demonstrated that both central and peripheral circadian signaling regulate skeletal growth and homeostasis. Disruption in central circadian rhythms has been associated with a decline in bone mineral density and the global and osteoblast-specific disruption of clock genes in bone tissue leads to lower bone mass. Gut physiology is highly sensitive to circadian disruption. Since the gut is also known to affect bone remodeling, we sought to test the hypothesis that circadian signaling disruption in colon epithelial cells affects bone. We therefore assessed structural, functional, and cellular properties of bone in 8 week old Ts4-Cre and Ts4-Cre;Bmal1fl/fl (cBmalKO) mice, where the clock gene Bmal1 is deleted in colon epithelial cells. Axial and appendicular trabecular bone volume was significantly lower in cBmalKO compared to Ts4-Cre 8-week old mice in a sex-dependent fashion, with male but not female mice showing the phenotype. Similarly, the whole bone mechanical properties were deteriorated in cBmalKO male mice. The tissue level mechanisms involved suppressed bone formation with normal resorption, as evidenced by serum markers and dynamic histomorphometry. Our studies demonstrate that colon epithelial cell-specific deletion of Bmal1 leads to trabecular and cortical bone loss in male mice.",

To restore defects in cellular communication, we developed a synthetic, photon-assisted synaptic transmission (PhAST) system. PhAST is based on luciferases and channelrhodopsins that enable the transmission of a neuronal state across space, using photons as neurotransmitters. We demonstrate the ability to overcome synaptic barriers and rescue the behavioral deficit of a genetically engineered glutamate mutant with conditional, Ca2+-triggered photon emission between two cognate neurons of the Caenorhabditis elegans nociceptive avoidance circuit. We also deploy these ingredients for asynaptic transmission between two unrelated cells in a sexually dimorphic neuronal network. Functional PhAST could sensitize otherwise poorly responsive males to touch and hence expand the behavioral repertoire. Our study, thus, establishes a powerful framework for complex photon-based communication between neurons in a living animal, that can readily be expanded to synthetic neuronal networks, organoids or non-invasive brain-machine interfaces.",

Here we investigated the involvement of this pathway in B cells from human tissue. Our data revealed that autophagy is specifically induced in germinal-center and memory B cell sub-populations from human tonsil and spleen. Transcriptomic analysis showed that induction of autophagy is related to unique aspects of activated B cells such as mitochondrial metabolism. To understand the function of non-canonical autophagy in B cells, we used CRISPR-mediated knockdown of autophagy genes. Integrating data from primary B cells and knockout cells we found that v-integrin-related non-canonical autophagy limits activation of specific pathways while promoting others. These data provide new mechanistic links for autophagy and immune dysregulation in diseases such as lupus.",

Interfering with all three branches causes tumorous germlines.

Here, we identify the phosphatase PPM-1.D/Wip1 as crucial substrate for PROM-1. We report that PPM-1.D antagonizes CHK-2 kinase, a key regulator for meiotic prophase initiation e.g., DNA double strand breaks, chromosome pairing and synaptonemal complex formation. We propose that PPM-1.D controls the amount of active CHK-2 by both catalytic and non-catalytic activities, where strikingly the non-catalytic regulation seems to be crucial at meiotic entry. PPM-1.D sequesters CHK-2 at the nuclear periphery and programmed SCFPROM-1 mediated degradation of PPM-1.D liberates the kinase and promotes meiotic entry.",

    "abstract": "A key factor controlling oocyte quality and fertility is lipids. Even though lipid droplets (LDs) are crucial regulators of lipid metabolism, their roles in fertility are poorly understood. During Drosophila oogenesis, LD accumulation in nurse cells coincides with dynamic actin remodeling necessary for late-stage follicle morphogenesis and fertility. Loss of the LD-associated Adipose Triglyceride Lipase (ATGL) disrupts both actin bundle formation and cortical actin integrity, an unusual phenotype also seen when Pxt, the enzyme responsible for prostaglandin (PG) synthesis, is missing. Dominant genetic interactions and PG treatment of follicles in vitro reveal that ATGL and Pxt act in the same pathway to regulate actin remodeling, with ATGL upstream of Pxt. Further, lipidomic analysis detects arachidonic acid (AA) containing triglycerides in ovaries. Because AA is the substrate for Pxt, we propose that ATGL releases AA from LDs to drive PG synthesis necessary for follicle development. We also find that exogenous AA is toxic to follicles in vitro, and LDs modulate this toxicity. This leads to the model that LDs both sequester AA to limit toxicity, and release AA via ATGL to drive PG production. We speculate that the same pathways are conserved across organisms to regulate oocyte development and promote fertility.",

    "abstract": "Intelligence describes the general cognitive ability level of a person. It is one of the most fundamental concepts in psychological science and is crucial for effective adaption of behavior to varying environmental demands. Changing external task demands have been shown to induce reconfiguration of functional brain networks. However, whether neural reconfiguration between different tasks is associated with intelligence has not yet been investigated. We used fMRI data from 812 subjects to show that higher scores of general intelligence are related to less brain network reconfiguration between resting state and seven different task states as well as to network reconfiguration between tasks. This association holds for all functional brain networks except the motor system, and replicates in two independent samples (N = 138, N = 184). Our findings suggest that the intrinsic network architecture of individuals with higher intelligence scores is closer to the network architecture as required by various cognitive demands. Multi-task brain network reconfiguration may, therefore, represent a neural reflection of the behavioral positive manifold - the essence of the concept of general intelligence. Finally, our results support neural efficiency theories of cognitive ability and reveal insights into human intelligence as an emergent property from a distributed multi-task brain network.",

Here we describe a practical method for rapid optimization of fluorescent proteins via directed molecular evolution in cultured mammalian cells. Using this method, we were able to perform screening of large gene libraries containing up to 2{middle dot}107 independent random genes of fluorescent proteins expressed in HEK cells completing one iteration directed evolution in a course of [~]8 days. We employed this approach to develop a set of green and near-infrared fluorescent proteins with enhanced intracellular brightness. The developed near-infrared fluorescent proteins demonstrated high performance for fluorescent labeling of neurons in culture and in vivo in model organisms such as C.elegans, Drosophila, zebrafish, and mice. Spectral properties of the optimized near-infrared fluorescent proteins enabled crosstalk-free multicolor imaging in combination with common green and red fluorescent proteins, as well as dual-color near-infrared fluorescence imaging. The described method has a great potential to be adopted by protein engineers due to its simplicity and practicality. We also believe that the new enhanced fluorescent proteins will find wide application for in vivo multicolor imaging of small model organisms.",

    "abstract": "Production and emigration of neural crest cells is a transient process followed by the emergence of the definitive roof plate. The mechanisms regulating the end of neural crest ontogeny are poorly understood. Whereas early crest development is stimulated by mesoderm-derived retinoic acid, we report that the end of the neural crest period is regulated by retinoic acid synthesized in the dorsal neural tube. Inhibition of retinoic acid signaling in the neural tube prevents the normal upregulation of BMP inhibitors in the nascent roof plate and prolongs the period of BMP responsiveness which otherwise ceases close to roof plate establishment. Consequently, neural crest production and emigration are extended well into the roof plate stage. In turn, extending the activity of neural crest-specific genes inhibits the onset of retinoic acid synthesis in roof plate suggesting a mutual repressive interaction between neural crest and roof plate traits. Although several roof plate-specific genes are normally expressed in the absence of retinoic acid signaling, roof plate and crest markers are co-expressed in single cells and this domain also contains dorsal interneurons. Hence, the cellular and molecular architecture of the roof plate is compromised. Collectively, our results demonstrate that neural tube-derived retinoic acid, via inhibition of BMP signaling, is an essential factor responsible for the end of neural crest generation and the proper segregation of dorsal neural lineages.",

    "abstract": "Normative learning theories dictate that we should preferentially attend to informative sources, but only up to the point that our limited learning systems can process their content. Humans, including infants, show this predicted strategic deployment of attention. Here we demonstrate that rhesus monkeys, much like humans, attend to events of moderate surprisingness over both more and less surprising events. They do this in the absence of any specific goal or contingent reward, indicating that the behavioral pattern is spontaneous. We suggest this U-shaped attentional preference represents an evolutionarily preserved strategy for guiding intelligent organisms toward material that is maximally useful for learning.",

    "abstract": "Two multisubunit protein complexes for membrane protein insertion were recently identified in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER): The guided entry of tail anchor proteins (GET) complex and ER membrane complex (EMC). The structures of both of their hydrophobic core subunits, that are required for the insertion reaction, revealed an overall similarity to the YidC/Oxa1/Alb3 family members found in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. This suggests that these membrane insertion machineries all share a common ancestry. To test whether these ER proteins can functionally replace Oxa1 in yeast mitochondria, we generated strains that express mitochondria-targeted Get2-Get1 and Emc6-Emc3 fusion proteins in Oxa1 deletion mutants. Interestingly, the Emc6-Emc3 fusion was able to complement an{Delta} oxa1 mutant and restored its respiratory competence. The Emc6-Emc3 fusion promoted the insertion of the mitochondrially encoded protein Cox2 as well as of nuclear encoded inner membrane proteins though was not able to facilitate the assembly of the Atp9 ring. Our observations indicate that protein insertion into the ER is functionally conserved to the insertion mechanism in bacteria and mitochondria and adheres to similar topological principles.",
