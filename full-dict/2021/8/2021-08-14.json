    "abstract": "Cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression and growth can have critical functional consequences, such as determining whether individual bacteria survive or die following stress. Although phenotypic variability is well documented, the dynamics that underlie it are often unknown. This information is important because dramatically different outcomes can arise from gradual versus rapid changes in expression and growth. Using single-cell time-lapse microscopy, we measured the temporal expression of a suite of stress response reporters in Escherichia coli, while simultaneously monitoring growth rate. In conditions without stress, we found several examples of pulsatile expression. Single-cell growth rates were often anti-correlated with gene expression, with changes in growth preceding changes in expression. These expression and growth dynamics have functional consequences, which we demonstrate by measuring survival after challenging cells with the antibiotic ciprofloxacin. Our results suggest that fluctuations in gene expression and growth dynamics in stress response networks can have direct consequences for survival.",

    "abstract": "The membrane-bound transcription factor Nrf1 (i.e., encoded by Nfe2l1) is activated by sensing glucose deprivation, cholesterol excess, proteasomal inhibition and oxidative stress, and then mediates distinct signaling responses in order to maintain cellular homeostasis. Herein, we found that Nrf1 stability and transactivity are both enhanced by USP19, a ubiquitin-specific protease tail-anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through its C-terminal transmembrane domain. Further experiments revealed that USP19 directly interacts with Nrf1 in proximity to the ER and topologically acts as a deubiquitinating enzyme to remove ubiquitin moieties from this protein, and hence allows it to circumvent the potential proteasomal degradation. Such USP19-mediated effect takes place only after Nrf1 is retrotranslocated by p97 out of ER membranes to dislocate the cytoplasmic side. Conversely, knockout of USP19 causes significant decreases in the Nrf1 abundance and its active isoform entering the nucleus, resulting in down-regulation of its target proteasomal subunits. This led to a modest reduction of USP19-/--derived tumor growth in xenograft mice, when compared with wild-type controls. Altogether, these demonstrate that USP19 serves as a novel mechanistic modulator of Nrf1, but not Nrf2, enabling Nrf1 to be rescued from putative ubiquitin-directed ER-associated degradation pathway. In turn, our additional experimental evidence has unraveled that transcriptional expression of endogenous USP19 and its promoter-driven reporter genes is differentially regulated by Nrf2, as well by Nrf1, at distinct layers within a complex hierarchical regulatory network.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms regulating cell movement are not fully understood. One feature of cell movement that determines how far cells displace from an initial position is persistence, the ability to perform movements in a direction similar to the previous movement direction. Persistence is thus determined by turning angles between two sequential displacements and be characterized by an average turning angle or persistence time. Recent studies found that a cells average speed and turning are negatively correlated, suggesting a fundamental cell-intrinsic program whereby cells with a lower turning ability (i.e., larger persistence time) are intrinsically faster (or faster cells turn less). By simulating correlated or persistent random walks (PRWs) using two different frameworks (one based on von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and another based on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process) we show that the negative correlation between speed and turning naturally arises when cell trajectories are sub-sampled, i.e., when the frequency of sampling is lower than frequency at which cells make movements. This effect is strongest when the sampling frequency is on the order of magnitude with the typical cell persistence time and when cells vary in persistence time. Both conditions are observed for datasets of T cell movements in vivo that we have analyzed. In simulations the correlation arises due to randomness of cell movements resulting in highly variable persistence times for individual cells that with sub-sampling leads to large variability of average cell speeds. Interestingly, previously suggested methodology of calculating displacement of cell cohorts with different speeds resulted in similar results whether or not there is a cell-intrinsic correlation between cell speed and persistence. For both vMF- and OU-based simulations of PRWs we could find parameter values (distribution of persistence times, speeds, and sampling frequency) that matched experimentally measured correlations between speed and turning for two datasets of T cell movement in vivo suggesting that such simple correlations are not fully informative on the intrinsic link between speed and persistence. Our results thus suggest that sub-sampling may contribute to (and perhaps fully explains) the observed correlation between speed and turning at least for some cell trajectory data and emphasize the role of sampling frequency in inference of critical cellular parameters of cell motility such as speeds.\n\nSecondary AbstractMeasurement of cell movements often results in a negative correlation between average speed and average turning angle suggesting an existence of a universal, cell-intrinsic movement program. We show that such a negative correlation may arise if cells in the population differ in their ability for persistent movement when the movement data are sub-sampled. We show that sub-sampling of cell trajectories generated using two different frameworks of persistent random walk can match the experimentally observed correlation between speed and turning for T cell movements in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Foraging is a common decision problem in natural environments. When new exploitable sites are always available, a simple optimal strategy is to leave a current site when its return falls below a single average reward rate. Here, we examined foraging in a more structured environment, with a limited number of sites that replenished at different rates and had to be revisited. When participants could choose sites, they visited fast-replenishing sites more often, left sites at higher levels of reward, and achieved a higher net reward rate. Decisions to exploit-or-leave a site were best explained with a computational model that included both the average reward rate for the environment and reward information about the unattended sites. This suggests that unattended sites influence leave decisions, in foraging environments where sites can be revisited.\n\nHighlightsO_LIBeing able to select sites during foraging increased visits to high value sites\nC_LIO_LIThis visitation pattern was efficient, producing higher average reward rates\nC_LIO_LIDecisions to leave a site were influenced by information about alternative sites\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/426950v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2e662org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6352eaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d8aae7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bc60a6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPathogenic mutations in genes that control chromatin function have been implicated in rare genetic syndromes. These chromatin modifiers exhibit extraordinary diversity in the scale of the epigenetic changes they affect, from single basepair modifications by DNMT1 to whole genome structural changes by PRM1/2. Patterns of DNA methylation are related to a diverse set of epigenetic features across this full range of epigenetic scale, making DNA methylation valuable for mapping regions of general epigenetic dysregulation. However,existing methods are unable to accurately identify regions of differential methylation across this full range of epigenetic scale directly from DNA methylation data.\n\nResultsTo address this, we developed DMRscaler, a novel method that uses an iterative windowing procedure to capture regions of differential DNA methylation (DMRs) ranging in size from single basepairs to whole chromosomes. We benchmarked DMRscaler against several DMR callers in simulated and natural data comparing XX and XY peripheral blood samples. DMRscaler was the only method that accurately called DMRs ranging in size from 100 bp to 1 Mb (pearsons r = 0.96) and up to 152 Mb on the X-chromosome. We then analyzed methylation data from rare-disease cohorts that harbor chromatin modifier gene mutations in NSD1, EZH2, and KAT6A where DMRscaler identified novel DMRs spanning gene clusters involved in development.\n\nConclusionTaken together, our results show DMRscaler is uniquely able to capture the size of DMR features across the full range of epigenetic scale and identify novel, co-regulated regions that drive epigenetic dysregulation in human disease.",

However, the protein functions of several highly injury-induced genes including Gpr151 for regulating the regenerative ability remain unclear. Here we present an alternative approach focused on non-coding functions of the coding genes, which led to the identification of the non-coding function of Gpr151 RNA interacting with RNA- binding proteins such as CSDE1. Gpr151 promotes axon regeneration by the function of its 5- untranslated region (5UTR) and expression of an engineered form of the 5UTR improves regenerative capacity in vitro and in vivo in both sciatic nerve and optic nerve injury models. Our data suggest that searching injury-induced coding genes potentially functioning by their non- coding regions is required for the RNA-based gene therapy for improving axon regeneration.",

During the time necessary to perform a single acquisition, it is likely that uncontrollable factors alter the validity of the initial mass calibration of the instrument, resulting in mass errors of magnitude significantly larger than their expected values. This phenomenon has a two-fold detrimental effect: a) it reduces the ability to interpret the results based on the observed signals, b) it can affect the quality of the observed signal spatial distributions.\n\nResultsWe present a post-acquisition computational method capable of reducing the observed mass drift by up to 60 ppm in biological samples, exploiting the presence of typical molecules with a known mass-to-charge ratio. The procedure, tested on time-of-flight (TOF) and Orbitrap mass spectrometry analyzers interfaced to a desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) source, improves the molecular annotation quality and the spatial distributions of the detected ions.\n\nConclusionThe presented method represents a robust and accurate tool for performing post-acquisition mass recalibration of DESI-MSI datasets and can help to increase the reliability of the molecular assignment and the data quality.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing appreciation of the importance of drug-target binding kinetics for lead optimization. For G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which mediate signaling over a wide range of timescales, the drug dissociation rate is often a better predictor of in vivo efficacy than binding affinity, although it is more challenging to compute. Here, we assess the ability of the {tau}-Random Acceleration Molecular Dynamics ({tau}RAMD) approach to reproduce relative residence times and reveal dissociation mechanisms and the effects of allosteric modulation for two important membrane-embedded drug targets: the {beta}2-adrenergic receptor and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2. The dissociation mechanisms observed in the relatively short RAMD simulations (in which molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed using an additional force with an adaptively assigned random orientation applied to the ligand) are in general agreement with much more computationally intensive conventional MD and metadynamics simulations. Remarkably, although decreasing the magnitude of the random force generally reduces the number of egress routes observed, the ranking of ligands by dissociation rate is hardly affected and agrees well with experiment. The simulations also reproduce changes in residence time due to allosteric modulation and reveal associated changes in ligand dissociation pathways.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS GRAPHIC\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/449151v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@743dcdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1857381org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@62359aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ad38a3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Cognitive-relevant information is processed by different brain areas that cooperate to eventually produce a response. The relationship between local activity and global brain states during such processes, however, remains for the most part unexplored. To address this question, we designed a simple face-recognition task performed in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and monitored with intracranial EEG. Based on our observations, we developed a novel analytical framework (named \"local-global\" framework) to statistically correlate the brain activity in every recorded gray-matter region with the widespread connectivity fluctuations as proxy to identify concurrent local activations and global brain phenomena that may plausibly reflect a common functional network during cognition. The application of the local-global framework to the data from 3 subjects showed that similar connectivity fluctuations found across patients were mainly coupled to the local activity of brain areas involved in face information processing. In particular, our findings provide preliminary evidence that the reported global measures might be a novel signature of functional brain activity reorganization when a stimulus is processed in a task context regardless of the specific recorded areas.\n\nData availability statementDue to institutional restrictions, the data that supports the findings of this study can be accessed only with a data sharing agreement.

    "abstract": "Serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) can provide comprehensive 3D ultrastructural information of the brain with exceptional computational cost. Targeted reconstruction of subcellular structures from ssEM datasets is less computationally demanding but still highly informative. We thus developed a Region-CNN-based deep learning method to identify, segment, and reconstruct synapses and mitochondria to explore the structural plasticity of synapses and mitochondria in the auditory cortex of mice subjected to fear conditioning. Upon reconstructing over 135,000 mitochondria and 160,000 synapses, we found that fear conditioning significantly increases the number of mitochondria but decreases their size, and promotes the formation of multi-contact synapses comprising a single axonal bouton and multiple postsynaptic sites from different dendrites. Modeling indicates that such multi-contact configuration increases the information storage capacity of new synapses by over 50%. With high accuracy and speed in reconstruction, our method yields structural and functional insight into cellular plasticity associated with fear learning.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modification by the small ubiquitin-like modifier, SUMO can modulate the activity of its conjugated proteins. The transcriptional regulator Jun, a member of the AP-1, complex is one such SUMO target. We find that Jra, the Drosophila Jun ortholog, is a regulator of the Pseudomonas entomophila induced gut immune gene regulatory network, modulating the expression of a few thousand genes, as measured by quantitative RNA sequencing. Decrease in Jra in gut enterocytes is protective, suggesting that reduction of Jra signaling favors the host over the pathogen. In Jra, lysines 29 and 190 are SUMO conjugation targets, with the JraK29R+K190R double mutant being SUMO conjugation resistant (SCR). Interestingly, a JraSCR fly line, generated by CRISPR/Cas9 based genome editing, is more sensitive to infection, with adults showing a weakened host response and increased proliferation of Pseudomonas. Transcriptome analysis of the guts of JraSCR and JraWT flies suggests that lack of SUMOylation of Jra significantly changes core elements of the immune gene regulatory network, that include antimicrobial agents, secreted ligands, feedback regulators, and transcription factors. SUMOylation attenuates Jra activity, with the master immune regulator Relish being an important transcriptional target. Our study implicates Jra as a major immune regulator, with dynamic SUMO conjugation/deconjugation modulating the kinetics of the gut transcriptional immune response.",

Fifteen isolates of 88 isolates in T. asperellum were characterized on morphological and physiological features. All of the isolates were produced at 35 {degrees}C, but only TR27 and TR45 were grown and sporulate at 40 {degrees}C. Mycelial growth of all the isolates was reduced with the increasing of pH value. Molecular characterization in four isolates of TR27, TR45, TR70 and TR85 were studied at ITS and TEF region nucleotide sequencing among 15 isolates of T. asperellum and the morphological characterization at ITS and tef1 nucleotide sequencing was assimilated with molecular characterization. The isolates of TR45, TR70 and TR85 were found with 98% homology and TR27 exhibited 88% against their respective closest isolate. The isolates of TR27 and TR85 marked their respective nearest homology at 96%, while TR45 showed 99%, and 93% homology was signified with TR70 in TEF sequences. Three isolates (TR45, TR70 and TR85) were identified as T. asperellum of 100% bootstrap value and TR27 isolate was also recognized with 72% bootstrap value in phylogenetic tree. In phylogenetic analysis, tef1 extended better differentiation among the Trichoderma isolates within and among the groups of closely related species than the rDNA of the ITS region in reflecting wider variability in the isolates while a higher transversion ratio and evolutionary divergence were defined. Moreover the exploring of scientific and useful diversification of Trichoderma isolates on physiological and molecular traits has deemed in research fields.\n\nIMPORTANCETrichoderma is an important genus in different aspect of uses as biofertilizer and bioremediation in agriculture. Specific identification in physiological and molecular characterization has also foremost attention with genome sequences as stored in databases. The diversity and genetic distances were ascertained among the isolates in phylogenetic analysis with the sequence data of the ITS region and tef1 of known Trichoderma strains was found in GenBank. Consequently, the databases of Trichoderma asperellum in molecular characterization can be frequently studied in the beneficial scope of agriculture.

    "abstract": "DNA methylation age (DNAm age, epigenetic clock) is a novel and promising biomarker of aging. It is calculated from the methylation fraction of specific cytosine phosphate guanine sites (CpG sites) of genomic DNA. Several groups have proposed epigenetic clock algorithms and these differ mostly regarding the number and location of the CpG sites considered and the method used to assess the methylation status. Most epigenetic clocks are based on a large number of CpGs, e.g. as measured by DNAm microarrays. We have recently evaluated an epigenetic clock based on the methylation fraction of seven CpGs that were determined by methylation-sensitive single nucleotide primer extension (MS-SNuPE). This method is more cost-effective when compared to array-based technologies as only a few CpGs need to be examined. However, there is only little data on the correspondence in epigenetic age estimation using the 7-CpG clock and other algorithms.\n\nTo bridge this gap, in this study we measured the 7-CpG DNAm age using two methods, via MS-SNuPE and via the MethylationEPIC array, in a sample of 1,058 participants of the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II), assessed as part of the GendAge study. On average, participants were 75.6 years old (SD: 3.7, age range: 64.9 - 90.0, 52.6% female). Agreement between methods was assessed by Bland-Altman plots. DNAm age was highly correlated between methods (Pearsons r=0.9) and Bland-Altman plots showed a difference of 3.1 years. DNAm age by the 7-CpG formula was 71.2 years (SD: 6.9 years, SNuPE) and 68.1 years (SD: 6.4 years, EPIC array). The mean of difference in methylation fraction between methods for the seven individual CpG sites was between 0.7 and 13 percent. To allow direct conversion between methods we developed an adjustment formula with a randomly selected training set of 529 participants using linear regression. After conversion of the Illumina data in a second and independent validation set, the adjusted DNAm age was 71.44 years (SD: 6.1 years, n=529). In summary, we found the results of DNAm clocks to be highly comparable. Furthermore, we developed an adjustment formula that allows for direct conversion of estimates between methods and enables one singular clock to be used in studies that employ either the Illumina or the SNuPE method.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) cascade promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and is cardioprotective, with the three RAF kinases forming a node for signal integration. Our aims were to determine if BRAF is relevant for human heart failure, if BRAF promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and if Type 1 RAF inhibitors developed for cancer (that paradoxically activate ERK1/2 at low concentrations: the \"RAF paradox\") may have the same effect. BRAF was upregulated in heart samples from patients with heart failure compared with normal controls. We assessed the effects of activated BRAF in the heart using mice with tamoxifen-activated Cre for cardiomyocyte-specific knock-in of the activating V600E mutation into the endogenous gene. We used echocardiography to measure cardiac dimensions/function. Cardiomyocyte BRAFV600E induced cardiac hypertrophy within 10 d, resulting in increased ejection fraction and fractional shortening over 6 weeks. This was associated with increased cardiomyocyte size without significant fibrosis, consistent with compensated hypertrophy. The experimental Type 1 RAF inhibitor, SB590885, and/or encorafenib (a RAF inhibitor used clinically) increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes, and promoted hypertrophy, consistent with a \"RAF paradox\" effect. Both promoted cardiac hypertrophy in mouse hearts in vivo, with increased cardiomyocyte size and no overt fibrosis. In conclusion, BRAF potentially plays an important role in human failing hearts, activation of BRAF is sufficient to induce hypertrophy, and Type 1 RAF inhibitors promote hypertrophy via the \"RAF paradox\". Cardiac hypertrophy resulting from these interventions was not associated with pathological features, suggesting that Type 1 RAF inhibitors may be useful to boost cardiomyocyte function.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged prenatal or adult exposure to ethanol is detrimental to mental and physical well-being, resulting in developmental abnormalities, progressive addiction and ultimate death. A growing number of studies have shown the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in ethanol-related behaviors in mammals. However, the potential pharmacological actions of cannabinoids in ethanol responses have not been examined in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we systematically investigated the effects of various cannabinoids on ethanol preference, ethanol sensitivity and tolerance, and ethanol-induced developmental defect in Drosophila. We showed that treatment with the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) displayed a significant decrease in preference for consuming ethanol in adult flies. Interestingly, cannabinoids exhibited differential roles in short- and long-term ethanol tolerance in flies. Although cannabinoids had no detectable effects on short-term ethanol tolerance, CBD and the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) suppressed long-term tolerance to ethanol. Moreover, ethanol exposure delayed larval-to-pupal development and increased larval/pupal size. Unexpectedly, treatment with CBD or endocannabinoids did not attenuate ethanol-induced developmental delay, instead, exacerbated its detrimental effect. Thus, our systematical study reveals, for the first time, a differential role of the cannabinoids in the modulation of ethanol-related responses in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Depurination is a frequent modification to both DNA and RNA, in DNA causing point mutations through misincorporation, in RNA, disabling ribosomes and halting protein synthesis. Some modifications of nucleic acids can be determined by direct sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). However, the identification of modifications is often limited by noise and their variety and number. Ricin is a toxin which enters cells and depurinates an adenine base in the sarcin-ricin loop of the large ribosomal subunit. This leaves only a ribose backbone, thus inhibiting protein translation. In humans, biological threat agents and ribosome inactivating proteins, such as ricin and saporin, depurinate base 4605 on the 28S rRNA providing a single defined target to try and identify. We postulated that the depurination event could be detected using ONT direct RNA sequencing through a change in charge in the ricin loop. A software tool was developed, RIPpore, that quantified the adenine modification from direct RNA sequencing data of ribosomal RNA purified from respiratory epithelial cells exposed to ricin. This provided a novel method of directly identifying ricin exposure and a basis for ONTs utility in detecting lesions in nucleic acids caused by depurination events.",

The origin of ALS in the central nervous system is unclear, however cortical hyperexcitability appears as an early and intrinsic feature of ALS and has been linked to degeneration of spinal motor neurons via a dying-forward mechanism. Here, we implement chemogenetics to validate the dying forward hypothesis of ALS in mice. We show that chronic hyperexcitability of corticomotoneurons induced by excitatory chemogenetics results in motor symptoms and core neuropathological hallmarks of ALS, including corticomotoneuron loss, corticospinal tract degeneration and reactive gliosis. Importantly, corticomotoneuron loss was sufficient to drive degeneration of spinal motor neurons and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), associated with cytoplasmic TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology. These findings establish a cortical origin of ALS mediated by neuronal hyperexcitability, consistent with a dying forward mechanism of neurodegeneration.",

Specifically, using an in vivo axotomy assay in Drosophila, we show that matrix metalloproteinase-1 (Mmp-1) mRNAs and associated ribosomes are detected in distal processes of reactive glia where they are actively engulfing degenerating axonal material, suggesting that local translation is an important component of the glial immune response to axotomy.

    "abstract": "Immune system development is greatly influenced by vertically transferred cues. However, beyond antibody-producing B cells, little is known about the role of other cell subsets of the maternal immune system in regulating offspring immunity. We reasoned {gamma}{delta} T cells to be attractive candidates based on their tissue distribution pattern: abundant in the skin, mammary glands and female reproductive tract. Here we found that mice born from {gamma}{delta} T cell-deficient (TCR{delta}-/-) dams display, early after birth, a pulmonary milieu selectively enriched in type-2 cytokines such as IL-33, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, and type-2-polarized immune cells, when compared to the progeny of {gamma}{delta} T cell-sufficient dams. In addition, upon helminth infection, mice born from TCR{delta}-/- dams sustained an increased type-2 inflammatory response. Critically, this was independent of the genotype of the pups. Despite similar levels of circulating antibodies in mothers and progeny, the intestinal microbiota in the offspring of TCR{delta}-/- and TCR{delta}+/- dams harbored distinct bacterial communities acquired during birth and fostering. These differences were accompanied by changes in the intestinal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) profile. Importantly, antibiotic treatment abrogated the differences observed in the pulmonary milieu, and exogenous SCFA supplementation suppressed first-breath- and infection-induced inflammation. In summary, maternal {gamma}{delta} T cells control the establishment of a neonatal gut-lung axis by conditioning the postnatal microbial colonization of the off-spring and bacterial-derived metabolite availability; ultimately impacting on the development of pulmonary type-2 immunity in the offspring.",

    "abstract": "Commensal intestinal protozoa, unlike their pathogenic relatives, are neglected members of the mammalian microbiome. These microbes have a significant impact on the hosts intestinal immune homeostasis, typically by elevating anti-microbial host defense. Tritrichomonas musculis (T. mu), a protozoan gut commensal, strengthens the intestinal host defense against enteric Salmonella infections through Asc- and Il1r1-dependent Th1 and Th17 cell activation. However, the underlying inflammasomes mediating this effect remain unknown. Here, we report that colonization with T. mu results in an increase in luminal extracellular ATP, elevated levels of IL-1{beta}, and increased numbers of IL-18 receptor-expressing Th1 and Th17 cells in the colon. Mice deficient in either Nlrp1b or Nlrp3 failed to display these protozoan-driven immune changes and lost resistance to enteric Salmonella infections even in the presence of T. mu. These findings demonstrate that T. mu-mediated host protection requires sensors of extra and intracellular ATP to confer resistance to enteric Salmonella infections.\n\nKEY POINTSO_LIIntestinal colonization with the commensal Tritrichomonas musculis elevates luminal ATP levels\nC_LIO_LINLRP1B and NLRP3 activation is required for Tritrichomonas musculis-driven Th cell response.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDTwenty-four-hour rhythmicity in transcriptomes of tissues and organs is driven by local circadian oscillators, systemic factors, the central circadian pacemaker, and light-dark cycles. This rhythmicity is to some extent organ- and tissue-specific such that the sets of rhythmic transcripts or their timing are different across tissues/organs. Monitoring rhythmicity of tissues and organs holds promise for circadian medicine, but in humans most tissues and organs are not easily accessible. To investigate the extent to which rhythmicity in the human blood transcriptome reflects rhythmicity in tissues and organs, we compared the overlap and timing of rhythmic transcripts in human blood and rhythmic transcripts in 64 tissues/organs of the baboon.\n\nMETHODSRhythmicity in the transcriptomes of humans and baboons were compared using set logic, circular cross-correlation, circular clustering, functional enrichment analyses and partial least squares regression.\n\nRESULTSOf the 759 orthologous genes that were rhythmic in human blood, 652 (86%) were also rhythmic in at least one baboon tissue. Most of these genes were associated with basic processes such as transcription and protein homeostasis. 109 (17%) of the 652 overlapping rhythmic genes were reported as rhythmic in only one baboon tissue or organ and several of these genes have tissue/organ-specific functions. Analysis of the alignment between baboon and human transcriptomes showed that in these diurnal species, rhythmicity is aligned with the onset, rather than midpoint or end of light period. In both species, the timing of rhythmic transcripts displayed prominent  night and  day clusters, with genes in the dark cluster associated with translation. The timing of human and baboon transcriptomes was significantly correlated in 25 tissue/organs with an average earlier timing of 3.21 h (SD 2.47 h) in human blood.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThe human blood transcriptome contains sets of rhythmic genes that overlap with rhythmic genes of tissues/organs, some of which are tissue/organ-specific, in the baboon. The rhythmic sets vary across tissues/organs but the timing of most rhythmic genes is similar across human blood and baboon tissues/organs. These results have implications for our understanding of the regulation of rhythmicity across tissues/organs and species and development of blood transcriptome-based biomarkers for rhythmicity in tissues and organs.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is a fundamental process in vascular remodeling. Carotid artery ligation is commonly used for induction of neointima formation and vessel stenosis; however, the precise regulatory mechanism of vascular remodeling is not entirely understood. In this study, we showed that resident endothelial cells (ECs) are the origin of neointima cells and ECs transiently expressed CD45 in the early stage of neointima formation accompanied by increased expression of EndMT markers. In vitro, CD45-positive EndMT was induced by stabilization of HIF-1 with cobalt chloride or VHL inhibitor in human primary ECs, which mimicked the hypoxic condition of ligated artery, and promoted the formation of integrin 11-SHARPIN complex. Notably, a CD45 phosphatase inhibitor disrupted this complex, thereby destabilizing cell-cell junctions. These results suggest that the CD45 activity is required for the retention of an EC phenotype and cell-cell junctions during EndMT (termed \"partial EndMT\"). We thus propose a novel mechanism of partial EndMT that contributes to lumen re-organization during vascular injury.",

    "abstract": "Ant queens and workers commonly engage in conflict over reproductive allocation because they have different fitness optima. How such conflicts are resolved depends on the power that each party of interest holds. Here, we show that queens have control over caste allocation in the ant Cardiocondyla obscurior. With the discovery of crystalline deposits that allow the identification of queens and workers across the entire course of development, we demonstrate that caste fate is irreversibly determined in the egg stage. Comparison of queen and worker-destined eggs and larvae revealed size and weight differences in late development, but no discernible differences in traits that may be used in social interactions, including hair morphology and cuticular odors. In line with this lack of caste-specific traits, adult workers treated developing queens and workers indiscriminately, even in the presence of a fertile queen. Together with previous studies showing queen control over sex allocation, these results provide evidence that conflict over reproductive allocation is absent in this ant.",

    "abstract": "Small populations with limited geographic distributions are predicted to be threatened by inbreeding and lack of genetic diversity, both of which may negatively impact fitness and exacerbate population decline. One of the most extreme natural examples is the Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis), an iconic and critically endangered species with the smallest known habitat range of any vertebrate. This imperiled species has experienced severe declines in population size over the last thirty years and suffered major, repeated bottlenecks in 2007 and 2013, when the population sunk to 38 and 35 individuals, respectively. Here we sequenced contemporary and historical genomes of Devils Hole and neighboring Death Valley and Ash Meadows desert pupfishes to examine the genomic consequences of small population size. We found extreme inbreeding (FROH = 0.71 - 0.82) and increased genetic load in the Devils Hole pupfish. We also document unique fixed loss-of-function (LOF) alleles and deletions in genes associated with sperm motility, stress, and hypoxia within the extant Devils Hole pupfish population that likely reduce fitness. Comparisons between contemporary samples (2008 - 2012) and a genome sequenced from a 1980 formalin-fixed museum specimen suggest that inbreeding has increased 6% as the population has declined, but that many putatively deleterious variants have been segregating in the population since at least 1980. This includes a fixed early stop codon in cfap43 (n = 8/8 samples), which is associated with sperm flagellum defects and causes infertility in humans and mice. Out of ninety-four unique deletions, fifteen were detected within 2 kb of annotated genes. Five have roles in physiological responses to hypoxia and mitochondrial activity, such as redd1 (n = 7/7 samples), suggesting impaired hypoxia tolerance in this species despite the low oxygen concentrations of Devils Hole. We thus document one of the most extreme inbreeding events in a natural population and a set of candidate deleterious variants to inform management and potential genetic rescue in this conservation icon.",

    "abstract": "Sex chromosomes have evolved many times across eukaryotes, indicating both their importance and their evolutionary flexibility. Some vertebrate groups, such as mammals and birds, have maintained a single, conserved sex chromosome system across long evolutionary time periods. By contrast, many reptiles, amphibians, and fish have undergone frequent sex chromosome transitions, most of which remain to be catalogued. Among reptiles, gecko lizards (infraorder Gekkota) have shown an exceptional lability with regard to sex chromosome transitions and may possess the majority of transitions within squamates (lizards and snakes). However--across geckos--information about sex chromosome linkage is expressly lacking, leaving large gaps in our understanding of the evolutionary processes at play in this system. To address this gap, we assembled the first chromosome-level genome for a gecko and use this linkage information to survey six Sphaerodactylus species using a variety of genomic data, including whole-genome re-sequencing, RADseq, and RNAseq. Previous work has identified XY systems in two species of Sphaerodactylus geckos. We expand upon that work to identify between two and four sex chromosome cis-transitions (XY to XY) within the genus. Interestingly, we confirmed two linkage groups as XY sex chromosome systems that were previously unknown to act as sex chromosomes in tetrapods (syntenic with Gallus 3 and Gallus 18/30/33). We highlight the increasing evidence that most (if not all) linkage groups will likely be identified as a sex chromosome in future studies given thorough enough sampling.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is becoming an attractive tool in mutagenesis-based protein engineering because of its ability to design a variant library containing proteins with a desired function. However, it remains unclear how ML guides directed evolution in sequence space depending on the composition of training data. Here, we present a ML-guided directed evolution study of an enzyme to investigate the effects of a known \"highly positive\" variant (i.e., variant known to have high enzyme activity) in training data. We performed two separate series of ML-guided directed evolution of Sortase A with and without a known highly positive variant called 5M in training data. In each series, two rounds of ML were conducted: variants predicted by the first round were experimentally evaluated, and used as additional training data for the second-round prediction. The improvements in enzyme activity were comparable between the two series, both achieving enzyme activity 2.2-2.5 times higher than 5M. Intriguingly, the sequences of the improved variants were largely different between the two series, indicating that ML guided the directed evolution to the distinct regions of sequence space depending on the presence/absence of the highly positive variant in the training data. This suggests that the sequence diversity of improved variants can be expanded not only by conventional ML using the whole training data, but also by ML using a subset of the training data even when it lacks highly positive variants. In summary, this study demonstrates the importance of regulating the composition of training data in ML-guided directed evolution.",

Particularly, whether A{beta} aggregation can induce neuronal demyelination remains unknown. Here we show that A{beta}-40 binds and induces extensive tubulation in the myelin membrane in vitro. The binding of A{beta}-40 depends predominantly on the lipid packing defect densities and electrostatic interactions and results in rigidification of the myelin membrane in the early time scales. Furthermore, elongation of A{beta}-40 into higher oligomeric and fibrillar species leads to eventual fluidization of the myelin membrane followed by extensive membrane tubulation observed in the late phase. Taken together, our results capture mechanistic insights into snapshots of temporal dynamics of A{beta}-40 - myelin membrane interaction and demonstrate how short timescale, local phenomena of binding, and fibril mediated load generation manifests into long timescale, global phenomena of myelin tubulation and demonstrates the ability of A{beta}-40 to demyelinate.",
