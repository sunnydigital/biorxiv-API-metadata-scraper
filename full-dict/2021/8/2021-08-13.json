    "abstract": "Pituitary adenomas have a staggering 16.7% lifetime prevalence and can be devastating in many patients due to profound endocrine and neurologic dysfunction. To date, no clear genomic or epigenomic markers correlates with their onset or severity. Herein, we investigate the impact of the O-GlcNAc post-translational modification in their etiology. Found in over 5000 human proteins to date, O-GlcNAcylation dynamically regulates proteins in critical signaling pathways, and its deregulation is involved in cancers progression and endocrine diseases such as diabetes.\n\nIn this study, we demonstrate that O-GlcNAcylation enzymes were upregulated, particularly in aggressive ACTH-secreting tumors, suggesting a role for O-GlcNAcylation in pituitary adenoma etiology. In addition to the demonstration that O-GlcNAcylation was essential for their proliferation, we show that the endocrine function of pituitary adenoma is also dependent on O-GlcNAcylation. In corticotropic tumors, hyper-secretion of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived hormone ACTH leads to Cushings disease, materialized by severe endocrine disruption and increased mortality. We demonstrate that Pomc mRNA is stabilized in an O-GlcNAc-dependent manner in response to corticotropic-stimulating hormone (CRH). By impacting Pomc mRNA splicing and stability, O-GlcNAcylation contributes to this new mechanism of fast hormonal response in corticotropes. Thus, this study stresses the essential role of O-GlcNAcylation in ACTH-secreting adenomas pathophysiology, including cellular proliferation and hypersecretion.",

Here we show that the small and large intestinal lamina propria (LP) contain similar FB subsets that locate in specific anatomical niches and express distinct arrays of epithelial support genes. However, there were tissue specific differences in the transcriptional profile of intestinal FB subsets in the two sites. All adult intestinal LP mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), including FB, smooth muscle cells (SMC) and pericytes derive from Gli1-expressing embryonic precursors which we identify as mesothelial cells. Trajectory analysis suggested that adult SMC and FB derive from distinct embryonic intermediates, and that adult FB subsets develop in a linear trajectory from CD81+ FB. Finally, we show that colonic subepithelial PDGFRhi FB comprise several functionally and anatomically distinct populations that originate from an Fgfr2-expressing FB intermediate. Collectively our results provide novel insights into MSC diversity, location, function and ontogeny, with implications for our understanding of intestinal development, homeostasis and disease.",

    "abstract": "Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is one of the five antibody classes produced in mammals as part of the humoral responses. This high-affinity antibody produced late in a primary immune response is responsible for protecting the organisms from infection. This proteins heavy chain constant region is encoded by the Ig gamma gene (Ig{gamma}). In Humans, IgG has evolved into four subclasses with specialized effector functions. However, in Platyrrhini, IgG has been reported to be encoded by a single-copy gene. Here, we analyzed data from 38 primate genome sequences to identify Ig{gamma} genes and describe the evolution of this immunoglobulin in this group. Ig{gamma} belongs to a multigene family that evolves by the birth-death evolutionary model in primates. Whereas Strepsirrhini and Platyrrhini have a single-copy gene, in Catarrhini species it has expanded to having several paralogs in their genomes; some have been deleted or have become pseudogenes. Furthermore, episodic positive selection might promote a specialized species-specific IgG effector function. A hypothesis for the Ig{gamma} evolution has been proposed, suggesting that IgG has evolved to reach an optimal number of copies per genome to adapt their humoral immune responses to different environmental conditions.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=105 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/456010v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9b9ec3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d42b16org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@158c023org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ae5117_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Males and females share essentially the same genome but differ in their optimal values for many phenotypic traits, which can result in intra-locus conflict between the sexes. Aphids display XX/X0 sex chromosomes and combine unusual X chromosome inheritance with cyclical parthenogenesis. Theoretical and empirical works support the hypothesis that the large excess of male-biased genes observed on the aphid X chromosome compared to autosomes evolved in response to sexual conflicts, by restricting the products of sexually antagonistic alleles to the sex they benefits. However, whether such masculinization of the X affects all tissues (as expected if it evolved in response to sexual conflicts) or is limited to specific tissues remains an open question. Here, we measured gene expression in three different somatic and gonadic tissues of males, sexual females and parthenogenetic females of the pea aphid. We observed a masculinization of the X in each of the studied tissues, with male-biased genes being 2.5 to 3.5 more frequent on the X than expected. We also tested the hypothesis that gene duplication can facilitate the attenuation of conflicts by allowing gene copies to neo- or sub-functionalize and reach sex-specific optima. As predicted, X-linked copies of duplicated genes having their other copies on autosomes were more frequently male-biased (40.5% of the genes) than duplicated autosomal genes (6.6%) or X-linked single-copy genes (32.5%). These results highlight a peculiar pattern of expression of X-linked genes in aphids at the tissue level and provide further support for sex-biased expression as a mechanism to attenuate intra-locus sexual conflicts.",

    "abstract": "The large-scale open access whole-exome sequencing (WES) data of the UK Biobank ~200,000 participants is accelerating a new wave of genetic association studies aiming to identify rare and functional loss-of-function (LoF) variants associated with a broad range of complex traits and diseases, however the community is in short of stringent replication of new associations. In this study, we proposed to merge the WES genotypes and the genome-wide genotyping (GWAS) genotypes of 167,000 UKB Caucasian participants into a combined reference panel, and then to impute 241,911 UKB Caucasian participants who had the GWAS genotypes only. We then proposed to use the imputed data to replicate association identified in the discovery WES sample. Using a leave-100-out imputation strategy in the reference panel, we showed that average imputation accuracy measure r2 is modest to high at LoF variants of all minor allele frequency (MAF) intervals including ultra-rare ones: 0.942 at MAF interval [1%, 50%], 0.807 at [0.1%, 1.0%), 0.805 at [0.01%, 0.1%), 0.664 at [0.001%, 0.01%) and 0.410 at (0, 0.001%). As applications, we studied single variant level and gene level associations of LoF variants with estimated heel BMD (eBMD) and 4 lipid traits: high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (TC). In addition to replicating dozens of previously reported genes such as MEPE for eBMD and PCSK9 for more than one lipid trait, the results also identified 2 novel gene-level associations: PLIN1 (cumulative MAF=0.10%, discovery BETA=0.38, P=1.20x10-13; replication BETA=0.25, P=1.03x10-6) and ANGPTL3 (cumulative MAF=0.10%, discovery BETA=-0.36, P=4.70x10-11; replication BETA=-0.30, P=6.60x10-11) for HDL-C, as well as one novel single variant level association (11:14843853:C:T, MAF=0.11%, discovery BETA=-0.31, P=2.70x10-9; replication BETA=-0.31, P=8.80x10-14, PDE3B) for TG.

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial protein import in the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei is mediated by the atypical outer membrane translocase, ATOM. It consists of seven subunits including ATOM69, the import receptor for hydrophobic proteins. Ablation of ATOM69, but not of any other subunit, triggers a unique quality control pathway resulting in the proteasomal degradation of non-imported mitochondrial proteins. The process requires a protein of unknown function, an E3 ubiquitin ligase and the ubiquitin-like protein (TbUbL1), which all are recruited to the mitochondrion upon ATOM69 depletion. TbUbL1 is a nuclear protein, a fraction of which is released to the cytosol upon triggering of the pathway. Nuclear release is essential as cytosolic TbUbL1 can bind mislocalised mitochondrial proteins and likely transfers them to the proteasome. Mitochondrial quality control has previously been studied in yeast and metazoans. Finding such a pathway in the highly diverged trypanosomes suggests such pathways are an obligate feature of all mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "Nucleic acid aptamers are bio-molecular recognition agents that bind to their targets with high specificity and affinity, and hold promise in a range of biosensor and therapeutic applications. In the case of small molecule targets, their small size and limited number of functional groups constitute challenges for their detection by aptamer-based biosensors because bio-recognition events may both be weak and produce poorly transduced signals. The binding affinity is principally used to characterize aptamer-ligand interactions; however a structural understanding of bio-recognition is arguably more valuable in order to design a strong response in biosensor applications. Using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance, circular dichroism, and isothermal titration calorimetry, we propose a binding model for a new methamphetamine aptamer and determine the main interactions driving complex formation. These measurements reveal only modest structural changes to the aptamer upon binding and are consistent with a conformational selection binding model. The aptamer-methamphetamine complex formation was observed to be entropically driven, apparently involving hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Taken together, our results establish a means of elucidating small molecule-aptamer binding interactions, which may be decisive in the development of aptasensors and therapeutics, and may contribute to a deeper understanding of interactions driving aptamer selection.",

    "abstract": "The root architecture of wild tomato, Solanum pimpinellifolium, can be viewed as a network connecting the main root to various lateral roots. Several constraints have been proposed on the structure of such biological networks, including minimizing the total amount of wire necessary for constructing the root architecture (wiring cost), and minimizing the distances (and by extension, resource transport time) between the base of the main root and the lateral roots (conduction delay). For a given set of lateral root tip locations, these two objectives compete with each other -- optimizing one results in poorer performance on the other -- raising the question how well S. pimpinellifolium root architectures balance this network design trade-off in a distributed manner. Here, we describe how well S. pimpinellifolium roots resolve this trade-off using the theory of Pareto optimality. We describe a mathematical model for characterizing the network structure and design trade-offs governing the structure of S. pimpinellifolium root architecture. We demonstrate that S. pimpinellifolium arbors construct architectures that are more optimal than would be expected by chance. Finally, we use this framework to quantify structural differences between arbors grown in the presence of salt stress, classify arbors into four distinct architectural ideotypes, and test for heritability of variation in root architecture structure.",

    "abstract": "Transposable element (TE) mobilization is a constant threat to genome integrity. Eukaryotic organisms have evolved robust defensive mechanisms to suppress their activity, yet TEs can escape suppression and proliferate, creating strong selective pressure for host defense to adapt. This genomic conflict fuels a never-ending arms race that drives the rapid evolution of TEs and recurrent positive selection of genes involved in host defense; the latter has been shown to contribute to postzygotic hybrid incompatibility. However, how TE proliferation impacts genome and regulatory divergence remains poorly understood. Here, we report the highly complete and contiguous (N50=33.8Mb - 38.0Mb) genome assemblies of seven closely-related Drosophila species that belong to the nasuta species group - a poorly studied group of flies that radiated in the last 2 million years. We constructed a high quality de novo TE library and gathered germline RNA-seq data, which allowed us to comprehensively annotate and compare insertion patterns between the species, and infer the evolutionary forces controlling their spread. We find a strong negative association between TE insertion frequency and expression of genes nearby; this likely reflects survivor-bias from reduced fitness impact of TE inserting near lowly expressed, non-essential genes, with limited TE-induced epigenetic silencing. Phylogenetic analyses of insertions of 147 TE families reveal that 53% of them show recent amplification in at least one species. The most highly amplified TE is an non-autonomous DNA element DINE which has gone through multiple bouts of expansions with thousands of full length copies littered throughout each genome. Across all TEs, we find that TEs expansions are significantly associated with high expression in the expanded species consistent with suppression escape. Altogether, our results shed light on the heterogenous and context-dependent nature in which TEs affect gene regulation and the dynamics of rampant TE proliferation amidst a recently radiated species group.",

Conspicuous traits that signal an individuals species, sex, and breeding status reduce the challenge of identifying a compatible conspecific mate, and should be more common in migratory rather than sedentary species, species with shorter breeding seasons, and species breeding under high sympatry with many closely-related heterospecifics. Here, we tested this recognition hypothesis for promoting plumage sexual dichromatism in the true thrushes (Turdus spp.), a large and diverse genus of passerine birds. We used receptor-noise limited models of avian vision to quantify avian-perceived chromatic and achromatic visual contrasts between male and female plumage patches and tested the influence of breeding season length, spatial distribution, and sympatry with other Turdus species on plumage dichromatism. As predicted, we found that 1) true thrush species with migratory behaviour have greater plumage sexual dichromatism than non-migratory species, 2) species with longer breeding seasons have less plumage sexual dichromatism, and 3) greater numbers of Turdus thrush species breeding in sympatry is associated with more plumage sexual dichromatism. These results suggest that social recognition systems, including species and mate recognition, play a prominent role in the evolution of plumage sexual dichromatism in true thrushes.",

Functional evidence can be obtained in a variety of models and assay systems, including patient-derived tissues and iPSCs, in vitro cellular assays, and in vivo assays. Here we evaluate the reliability and practicality of variant interpretation in the small animal model, C. elegans, through a series of experiments evaluating the function of syntaxin binding protein, STXBP1, a well-known causative gene for Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 1 (EIEE1).\n\nMethodsUsing CRISPR, we replaced the coding sequence for unc-18 with the coding sequence for the human ortholog STXBP1. Next, we used CRISPR to introduce precise point mutations in the human STXBP1 coding sequence, reflecting three clinical categories (benign, pathogenic, and variants of uncertain significance (VUS)). We quantified 26 features of the resulting worms movement to train Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) machine learning classifiers on known pathogenic and benign variants. We characterized the classifiers, and then used the behavioral data from the VUS-expressing animals to predict the categorization of the VUS.\n\nResultsWhereas knock-out worms without unc-18 are severely impaired in motor function, worms expressing STXBP1 in its place have restored motor function. We produced worms with STXBP1 variants previously classified by ACMG criteria, including 25 benign variants, 32 pathogenic, and 24 variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Using either SVM or RF classifiers, we were able to obtain a sensitivity of 0.84-0.97 on known benign and pathogenic strains. By comparing multiple ML classification methods, we were able to classify 9 of the VUS as functionally abnormal, suggesting that these VUS are likely to be pathogenic.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate that automated analysis of a small animal system is an effective, scalable, and fast way to understand functional consequences of variants in STXBP1, one of the most common causes of genetic epilepsies and neurodevelopmental disorders.",

Here, we used large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and two-dimensional replica exchange umbrella sampling calculations with more than a thousand windows and an aggregate total of 160 {micro}s of simulation to investigate this transition with and without glycans. We find that the glycosylated spike has a higher barrier to opening and also energetically favors the down state over the up state. Analysis of the S-protein opening pathway reveals that glycans at N165 and N122 interfere with hydrogen bonds between the RBD and the N-terminal domain in the up state, while glycans at N165 and N343 can stabilize both the down and up states. Finally we estimate how epitope exposure for several known antibodies changes along the opening path.

    "abstract": "Micellization and morphology of spherical telechelic micelles formed by tri-block copolymers with short solvophobic end blocks at low concentrations is discussed within scaling argumentsand Single Chain Mean Field Theory (SCMFT). In ultra-dilute regime, individual telechelic polymer chains can exist in solution in two distinct states: open linear chain conformation with two free ends and closed loop conformation, when two ends are connected by the effective attraction between two solvophobic ends. At concentrations below gelation point, closed loops tend to form micelles comprised mostly of loops in flower-like micelles, while linear polymers in open conformations tend to form star-shaped aggregates with one hydrophobic dangling end. Resulting two kinds of micelles have remarkably different topology and dimensions, while the transition between them can be driven by the entropy, namely conformation changes between domination of the looped and linear conformations. The transition between two types of micelles lies in a narrow interaction parameters range. Thus, these topological micelles are very sensitive to the changes in external environment and they can serve as a very sensitive stimuli-responsive smart materials.\n\nGraphical TOC Entry\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/455870v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (10K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16b8279org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@142fb97org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@938fc5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c3e145_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Genetic design automation methods for combinational circuits often rely on standard algorithms from electronic design automation in their circuit synthesis and technology mapping. However, those algorithms are domain-specific and are hence often not directly suitable for the biological context. In this work we identify aspects of those algorithms that require domain-adaptation. We first demonstrate that enumerating structural variants for a given Boolean specification allows us to find better performing circuits and that stochastic gate assignment methods need to be properly adjusted in order to find the best assignment. Second, we present a general circuit scoring scheme that accounts for the limited accuracy of biological device models including the variability across cells and show that circuits selected according to this score exhibit higher robustness with respect to parametric variations. If gate characteristics in a library are just given in terms of intervals, we provide means to efficiently propagate signals through such a circuit and compute corresponding scores. We demonstrate the novel design approach using the Cello gate library and 33 logic functions that were synthesized and implemented in vivo recently (1). We show that an average 1.3-fold and a peak 6.5-fold performance increase can be achieved by simply considering structural variants and that an average 1.8-fold and a peak 30-fold gain in the novel robustness score can be obtained when selecting circuits according to it.\n\nGraphical TOC Entry\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=82 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/456094v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 2\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3ef8aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@635957org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7e747eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@122db0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "IntroductionPatients suffering from primary or secondary immunodeficiency (PID or SID) face times of increased insecurity and discomfort in the light of the raging COVID-19 pandemic, not knowing if and to what extent their comorbidities impact the course of a potential SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, recently available vaccination options might not be amenable or effective for all patients of this heterogeneous population. Therefore, these patients often rely on passive immunization with plasma-derived, intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin (IVIG/SCIG).\n\nWhether the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and/or the progress in vaccination programs lead to increased and potentially protective titers in plasma-derived immunoglobulins (Ig) indicated, e.g., for humoral immunodeficiency remains a pressing question for this patient population.\n\nPurposeWe investigated SARS-CoV-2 reactivity of US plasma-derived IVIG/SCIG products from the end of 2020 until 06/2021 as well as in convalescent plasma (CP) from 05/2020 to 08/2020 to determine whether potentially neutralizing antibody titers may be present.\n\nMethodsFinal containers of IVIG/SCIG and CP donations were analyzed by commercial ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG as well as microneutralization assay using a patient-derived SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) isolate. Neutralization capacities of 313 plasma single donations and 119 plasma-derived IVIG/SCIG lots were determined. Results obtained from both analytical methods were normalized against the WHO International Standard. Finally, based on dense pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of an IVIG preparation from previously published investigations, possible steady-state plasma levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacities were approximated based on currently measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 potencies in IVIG/SCIG preparations.\n\nResultsCP donations presented with a high variability with regards to anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity in ELISA as well as in neutralization testing. While approximately 50% of convalescent donations were none/low neutralizing, approximately 10% were at or above 1000 IU/mL.\n\nIVIG/SCIG lots derived from pre-pandemic plasma donations did not show neutralizing capacities of SARS-CoV-2. Lots produced between 12/2020 and 06/2021, entailing plasma donations after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 showed a rapid and constant increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity and neutralization capacity over time. While lot-to-lot variability was substantial, neutralization capacity increased from a mean of 20 IU/mL in 12/2020 to 505 IU/mL in 06/2021 with a maximum of 864 IU/mL for the most recent lots.\n\nPharmacokinetic extrapolations, based on non-compartmental superposition principles using steady-state reference profiles from previously published PK investigations on IVIG in PID, yielded potential steady-state trough plasma levels of 16 IU/mL of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 IgG based on the average final container concentration from 05/2021 of 216 IU/mL. Maximum extrapolated trough levels could reach 64 IU/mL based on the latest maximal final container potency tested in 06/2021.\n\nConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 reactivity and neutralization capacity in IVIG/SCIG produced from US plasma rapidly and in part exponentially increased in the first half of 2021. The observed increase of final container potencies is likely trailing the serological status of the US donor population in terms of COVID-19 convalescence and vaccination by at least 5 months due to production lead times and should in principle continue at least until fall 2021. In summary, the data support rapidly increasing levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in IVIG/SCIG products implicating that a certain level of protection could be possible against COVID-19 for regularly substituted PID/SID patients. Nevertheless, more research is still needed to confirm which plasma levels are needed to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in immune-compromised patients.\n\nPlain Language SummaryPeople with deficiencies in their immune system often have an insufficient antibody response to antigens, e.g., bacteria, viruses, or vaccines. These patients therefore often receive antibodies from healthy people to replace the missing antibodies and build a first line of defense against infections. These antibodies (also called immunoglobulins (Ig)) are prepared from plasma of healthy donors, the liquid fraction of the blood without cells. This plasma is then split up in pharmaceutical production into its protein components. One of these is immunoglobulin G (IgG), which is the protein family that neutralizes/inactivates infectious agents as well as marks these infectious agents so they can be recognized by other parts of the immune system. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the severe to fatal outcomes for certain patient groups, especially people with impaired immunity, these patients and their physicians are interested in whether their antibody replacement therapy also confers protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed the capability of plasma-derived Ig lots to (i) recognize SARS-CoV-2 protein by ELISA method as well as (ii) neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by neutralization studies using the actual virus under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions. Here we show increasing anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity over time of manufactured Ig lots produced between 12/2020 and 06/2021. The most recent lots had a neutralizing activity of up to 864 IU/mL. Considering that the USA represents Octapharmas main plasma source, the progress in vaccination levels together with the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in this country suggests that the IVIG/SCIG neutralization capacities against SARS-CoV-2 might still increase and could potentially meet a level where antibody plasma concentrations in the patient confer immune protection.\n\nKey PointsO_LIPatients with humoral immunodeficiency rely on plasma-derived immunoglobulin for passive immunization against numerous pathogens.\nC_LIO_LISARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacities of plasma-derived immunoglobulins have increased over time with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination campaigns.\nC_LIO_LIPlasma-derived immunoglobulin in prophylactic use for immunodeficient patients could potentially protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the future.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "IntroductionCOVID-19 vaccine efficacy has been evaluated in large clinical trials and in real-world situation. Although they have proven to be very effective in the general population, little is known about their efficacy in immunocompromised patients. HIV-infected individuals response to vaccine may vary according to the type of vaccine and their level of immunosuppression. We evaluated immunogenicity of an mRNA anti-SARS CoV-2 vaccine in HIV-positive individuals.\n\nMethodsHIV-positive individuals (n=121) were recruited from HIV clinics in Montreal and stratified according to their CD4 counts. A control group of 20 health care workers naive to SARS CoV-2 was used. The participants Anti-RBD IgG responses were measured by ELISA at baseline and 3 to 4 weeks after receiving the first dose of an mRNA vaccine).\n\nResultsEleven of 121 participants had anti-COVID-19 antibodies at baseline, and a further 4 had incomplete data for the analysis. Mean anti-RBD IgG responses were similar between between the HIV negative control group (n=20) and the combined HIV+ group (n=106) (p = 0.72). However, these responses were significantly lower in the group with <250 CD4 cells/mm3. (p<0.0001). Increasing age was independently associated with decreased immunogenicity.\n\nConclusionHIV-positive individuals with CD4 counts over 250 cells/mm3 have an anti-RBD IgG response similar to the general population. However, HIV-positive individuals with the lowest CD4 counts (<250 cells/mm3) have a weaker response. These data would support the hypothesis that a booster dose might be needed in this subgroup of HIV-positive individuals, depending on their response to the second dose.",

Among them, 1456 and 484 peptides are antigenic. 392 and 111 of the antigenic peptides were found in the conseved amino acid sequences. Among the antigenic-conserved peptides, 6 CD8+ T cell epitopes and 7 CD4+ T cell epitopes were identifed. The T cell epitopes could be presented to T cells by high-affinity HLA molecules which are encoded by the HLA alleles with high population coverage.\n\nConclusionsThe T cell epitopes are conservative, antigenic and HLA presentable, and could be constructed into SARS-COV-2 vaccines for inducing protective T cell immunity against SARS-COV-2 and their variants.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still adapting to its new human host. Attention has focussed on the viral spike protein, but substantial variation has been seen in the ORF8 gene. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 protein undergoes signal peptide-mediated processing through the endoplasmic reticulum and is secreted as a glycosylated, disulphide-linked dimer. The secreted protein from the prototype SARS-CoV-2 virus had no major effect on viability of a variety of cell types, or on IFN or NF-{kappa}B signalling. However, it modulated cytokine expression from primary CSF1-derived human macrophages, most notably by decreasing IL-6 and IL-8 secretion. Furthermore, a sequence polymorphism L84S that appeared early in the pandemic associated with the Clade S lineage of virus, showed a markedly different effect, of increasing IL-6 production. We conclude that ORF8 sequence polymorphisms can potentially affect SARS-CoV-2 virulence and should therefore be monitored in sequencing-based surveillance.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant has rapidly replaced the Alpha variant around the world. The mechanism that drives this global replacement has not been defined. Here we report that Delta spike mutation P681R plays a key role in the Alpha-to-Delta variant replacement. In a replication competition assay, Delta SARS-CoV-2 efficiently outcompeted the Alpha variant in human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues. Delta SARS-CoV-2 bearing the Alpha-spike glycoprotein replicated less efficiently than the wild-type Delta variant, suggesting the importance of Delta spike in enhancing viral replication. The Delta spike has accumulated mutation P681R located at a furin cleavage site that separates the spike 1 (S1) and S2 subunits. Reverting the P681R mutation to wild-type P681 significantly reduced the replication of Delta variant, to a level lower than the Alpha variant. Mechanistically, the Delta P681R mutation enhanced the cleavage of the full-length spike to S1 and S2, leading to increased infection via cell surface entry. In contrast, the Alpha spike also has a mutation at the same amino acid (P681H), but the spike cleavage from purified Alpha virions was reduced compared to the Delta spike. Collectively, our results indicate P681R as a key mutation in enhancing Delta variant replication via increased S1/S2 cleavage. Spike mutations that potentially affect furin cleavage efficiency must be closely monitored for future variant surveillance.",

    "abstract": "The genome of the wheat pathogenic fungus, Zymoseptoria tritici, represents extensive presence-absence variation in gene content. Here, we addressed variation in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) content and biochemical profiles among three isolates. We analysed secondary metabolite properties based on genome, transcriptome and metabolome data. The isolates represent highly distinct genome architecture, but harbor similar repertoire of BGCs. Expression profiles for most BGCs show comparable patterns of regulation among the isolates, suggesting a conserved \"biochemical infection program\". For all three isolates, we observed a strong up-regulation of an abscisic acid (ABA) gene cluster during biotrophic host colonization, indicating that Z. tritici potentially interfere with host defenses by the biosynthesis of this phytohormone. Further, during in vitro growth the isolates show similar metabolomes congruent with the predicted BGC content. We assessed if secondary metabolite production is regulated by histone methylation using a mutant impaired in formation of facultative heterochromatin (H3K27me3). In contrast to other ascomycete fungi, chromatin modifications play a less prominent role in regulation of secondary metabolites. In summary, we show that Z. tritici has a conserved program of secondary metabolite production contrasting the immense variation in effector expression, some of these metabolites might play a key role during host colonization.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementZymoseptoria tritici is one of the most devastating pathogens of wheat. So far the molecular determinants of virulence and their regulation are poorly understood. Previous studies have focused on proteinasous virulence factors and their extensive diversity. In this study, we focus on secondary metabolites produced by Z. tritici. Using a comparative framework, we here characterize core and non-core metabolites produced by Z. tritici by combining genome, transcriptome and metabolome datasets. Our findings indicate highly conserved biochemical profiles contrasting genetic and phenotypic diversity of the field isolates investigated here. This discovery has relevance for future crop protection strategies.",

Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, hyperglycemic conditions lead to markedly higher viral loads in kidney organoids compared to normoglycemia.

Herein, we expand this investigation to a wider range of animal species and viruses to provide a comprehensive source for large-scale screening of potential virus hosts. Single cell atlas for several mammalian species (alpaca, hamster, hedgehog, chinchilla etc.), as well as comparative atlas for lung, brain and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for various lineages of animals were constructed, from which we systemically analyzed the virus entry factors for 113 viruses over 20 species from mammalians, birds, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates. Conserved cellular connectomes and regulomes were also identified, revealing the fundamental cell-cell and gene-gene cross-talks between these species. Overall, our study could help identify the potential host range and tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and a diverse set of viruses and reveal the host-virus co-evolution footprints.",

    "abstract": "Tight junctions (TJs) between blood-brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cells construct a robust physical barrier, whose damage underlies BBB dysfunctions related to several neurodegenerative diseases. What makes these highly specialized BBB-TJs extremely restrictive remains unknown. Here, we use super-resolution microscopy (dSTORM) to uncover new structural and functional properties of BBB TJs. Focusing on three major components, Nano-scale resolution revealed sparse (occludin) vs. clustered (ZO1/claudin-5) molecular architecture. Developmentally, permeable TJs become first restrictive to large molecules, and only later to small molecules, with claudin-5 proteins arrangement compacting during this maturation process. Mechanistically, we reveal that ZO1 clustering is independent of claudin-5 in-vivo. In contrast to accepted knowledge, we found that in the developmental context, total levels of claudin-5 inversely correlate with TJ functionality. Our super-resolution studies provide a unique perspective of BBB TJs and open new directions for understanding TJ functionality in biological barriers, ultimately enabling restoration in disease or modulation for drug delivery.",

    "abstract": "When viewing objects depicted in a frame, observers prefer to view large objects like cars in larger sizes and smaller objects like cups in smaller sizes. That is, the visual size of an object that \"looks best\" is linked to its typical physical size in the world. Why is this the case? One intuitive possibility is that these preferences are driven by semantic knowledge: For example, when we recognize a sofa, we access our knowledge about its real-world size, and this influences what size we prefer to view the sofa within a frame. However, might visual processing play a role in this phenomenon--that is, do visual features that are related to big and small objects look better at big and small visual sizes, respectively, even when observers do not have explicit access to semantic knowledge about the objects? To test this possibility, we used \"texform\" images, which are synthesized versions of recognizable objects, which critically retain local perceptual texture and coarse contour information, but are no longer explicitly recognizable. To test for visual size preferences, we first used a size adjustment task, and the results were equivocal. However, clear results were obtained using a two-interval forced choice task, in which each texform was presented at the preferred visual size of its corresponding original image, and a visual size slightly bigger or smaller. Observers consistently selected the texform presented at the canonical visual size as the more aesthetically pleasing one. An additional control experiment ruled out alternative explanations related to size priming effects. These results suggest that the preferred visual size of an object depends not only on explicit knowledge of its real-world size, but also can be evoked by mid-level visual features that systematically covary with an objects real-world size.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe prefer to view large objects like cars large, and small objects like cups small\nC_LIO_LIIntuitively, such preferences may be driven by our knowledge of object sizes\nC_LIO_LIWe used unrecognizable texforms of objects that preserved mid-level visual features\nC_LIO_LISimilar viewing size preferences can be revealed with these texforms\nC_LIO_LISuch preferences thus arise not only from knowledge but also from visual processing\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Autoimmunity and cancer represent two different aspects of immune dysfunction. Autoimmunity is characterized by breakdowns in immune self-tolerance, while impaired immune surveillance can allow for tumorigenesis. The class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I), which displays derivatives of the cellular peptidome for immune surveillance by CD8+ T cells, serves as a common genetic link between these conditions. As melanoma-specific CD8+ T-cells have been shown to target melanocyte-specific peptide antigens more often than melanoma-specific antigens, we investigated whether vitiligo and psoriasis predisposing MHC-I alleles conferred a melanoma protective effect. In individuals with cutaneous melanoma from both The Cancer Genome Atlas (N = 451) and an independent validation cohort (N = 586), MHC-I autoimmune allele carrier status was significantly associated with a later age of melanoma diagnosis. Furthermore, MHC-I autoimmune allele carriers were significantly associated with decreased risk of developing melanoma in the Million Veterans Program cohort (OR = 0.962, p = 0.024). Existing melanoma polygenic risk scores (PRS) did not predict autoimmune allele carrier status, suggesting these alleles provide new risk-relevant information. Mechanisms of autoimmune protection were neither associated with improved melanoma-driver mutation association nor improved gene-level conserved antigen presentation relative to common alleles (population frequency > 1%). However, autoimmune alleles showed higher affinity relative to common alleles for particular windows of melanocyte conserved antigens suggesting a potential relationship between antigen processing, binding, and cell-surface presentation. Overall, this study presents evidence that MHC-I autoimmune risk alleles modulate melanoma risk unaccounted for by current PRS.",

    "abstract": "Cre recombinase catalyzes site-specific DNA recombination at pseudo-palindromic loxP sites through two rounds of strand cleavage, exchange, and religation. Cre is a potential gene editing tool of interest due its lack of requirements for external energy sources or host factors, as well as the fact that it does not generate potentially cytotoxic double-stranded DNA breaks. However, broader applications of Cre in editing noncanonical target sequences requires a deeper understanding of the DNA features that enable target site selection and efficient recombination. Although Cre recombines loxP DNA in a specific and ordered fashion, it makes few direct contacts to the loxP spacer, the region where recombination occurs. Furthermore, little is known about the structural and dynamic features of the loxP spacer that make it a suitable target for Cre. To enable NMR spectroscopic studies of the spacer, we have aimed to identify a fragment of the 34-bp loxP site that retains the structural features of the spacer while minimizing the spectral crowding and line-broadening seen in longer oligonucleotides. We report sequential backbone resonance assignments for loxP oligonucleotides of varying lengths and evaluate chemical shift differences, {Delta}{delta}, between the oligos. Analysis of flanking sequence effects and mutations on spacer chemical shifts indicates that nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor effects dominate the chemical environment experienced by the spacer. We have identified a 16-bp oligonucleotide that adequately preserves the structural environment of the spacer, setting the stage for NMR-based structure determination and dynamics investigations.",

    "abstract": "Base excision repair (BER) is the main pathway protecting cells from the continuous damage to DNA inflicted by reactive oxygen species. BER is initiated by DNA glycosylases, each of which repairs a particular class of base damage. NTHL1, a bifunctional DNA glycosylase, possesses both glycolytic and {beta}-lytic activities with a preference for oxidized pyrimidine substrates. Defects in human NTLH1 drive a class of polyposis colorectal cancer. We report the first X-ray crystal structure of hNTHL1, revealing an open conformation not previously observed in the bacterial orthologs. In this conformation, the six-helical barrel domain comprising the helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) DNA binding motif is tipped away from the iron sulphur cluster-containing domain, requiring a conformational change to assemble a catalytic site upon DNA binding. We found that the flexibility of hNTHL1 and its ability to adopt an open configuration can be attributed to an interdomain linker. Swapping the human linker sequence for that of Escherichia coli yielded a protein chimera that crystallized in a closed conformation and had a lower binding affinity for lesion-containing DNA. This large scale interdomain rearrangement during catalysis is unprecedented for a HhH superfamily DNA glycosylase and provides important insight into the molecular mechanism of hNTHL1.",

Here, we developed biocompatible core-shell lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) quantum dots emitting at ~1880 nm and superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPD) for single-photon detection up to 2000 nm, enabling one-photon fluorescence imaging window in the 1700-2000 nm (NIR-IIc) range. Confocal fluorescence imaging in NIR-IIc reached an imaging depth of ~ 800 m through intact mouse head, and enabled non-invasive imaging of inguinal lymph nodes (LNs) without any surgery.

    "abstract": "Microtubules (MTs) are polymers of /{beta}-tubulin heterodimers that stochastically switch between growth and shrinkage phases. This dynamic instability is critically important for MT function. It is believed that GTP hydrolysis within the MT lattice is accompanied by destabilizing conformational changes, and that MT stability depends on a transiently existing GTP cap at the growing MT end. Here we use cryo-EM and TIRF microscopy of GTP hydrolysis-deficient MTs assembled from mutant recombinant human tubulin to investigate the structure of a GTP-bound MT lattice. We find that the GTP-MT lattice of two mutants in which the catalytically active glutamate in -tubulin was substituted by inactive amino acids (E254A and E254N) is remarkably plastic. Undecorated E254A and E254N MTs with 13 protofilaments both have an expanded lattice, but display opposite protofilament twists, making these lattices distinct from the compacted lattice of wildtype GDP-MTs. End binding proteins of the EB family have the ability to compact both mutant GTP-lattices and to stabilize a negative twist, suggesting that they promote this transition also in the GTP cap of wildtype MTs, thereby contributing to the maturation of the MT structure. We also find that the MT seam appears to be stabilized in mutant GTP-MTs and destabilized in GDP-MTs, supporting the proposal that the seam plays an important role in MT stability. Together, these first high-resolution structures of truly GTP-bound MTs add mechanistic insight to our understanding of MT dynamic instability.\n\nSignificance StatementMicrotubules (MTs) are non-equilibrium polymers that switch between states of growth and shrinkage. This property is critical for their function and is a consequence of GTP hydrolysis in the MT. The structure of the stable GTP part of the MT (the GTP cap) has previously been inferred from MTs polymerized with non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs. Here, we report the first high-resolution structures of MTs truly containing GTP, polymerized from mutated, hydrolysis-deficient tubulins. We find that GTP-MTs have an \"expanded lattice\" and a \"closed seam\", structural characteristics possibly responsible for stabilizing the GTP cap. These results provide new insight into the structural transitions at growing MT ends, furthering our understanding of the bistable nature of MTs.",

Although CRISPRa approaches based on VP64 have been widely studied in both cultured cells and in animal models and exhibit great versatility for various cell types and developmental stages in vivo, different dCas9-VP64 versions have not been rigorously compared. Here, we compared different dCas9-VP64 constructs in identical contexts, including the cell lines used and the transfection conditions, for their ability to activate endogenous and exogenous genes. Moreover, we investigated the optimal approach for VP64 addition to VP64- and p300-based constructs. We found that MS2-MCP-scaffolded VP64 enhanced dCas9-VP64 and dCas9-p300 activity better than did direct VP64 fusion to the N-terminus of dCas9. dCas9-VP64+MCP-VP64 and dCas9-p300+MCP-VP64 were superior to VP64-dCas9-VP64 for all target genes tested. Furthermore, multiplexing gRNA expression with dCas9-VP64+MCP-VP64 or dCas9-p300+MCP-VP64 significantly enhanced endogenous gene activation to a level comparable to CRISPRa-SAM with a single gRNA. Our findings demonstrate improvement of the dCas9-VP64 CRISPRa system and contribute to development of a versatile, efficient CRISPRa platform.",

By gene expression profiling, genetic loss of function experiments and comprehensive phenotyping, we provide evidence that neurons increase cholesterol synthesis in chronic myelin disease models and MS patients.

We studied interactions of nAChR subunits with peptide neurotoxins by larval injections and styrene maleic acid lipid particles (SMALPs) pull-down assays. For the null alleles we determined the effects of -Bungarotoxin (-Btx) and {omega}-Hexatoxin-Hv1a (Hv1a) administration, identifying potential receptor subunits implicated in the binding of these toxins. We employed pull-down assays to confirm -Btx interactions with the D5, D6, D7 subunits. Finally, we report the localization of fluorescent tagged endogenous D6 during nervous system development.

    "abstract": "In HIV-1 infection, many antibodies (Abs) are elicited to Envelope (Env) epitopes that are conformationally masked in the native trimer and are only available for antibody recognition after the trimer binds host cell CD4. Among these are epitopes within the Co-Receptor Binding Site (CoRBS) and the constant region 1 and 2 (C1-C2 or Cluster A region). In particular, C1-C2 epitopes map to the gp120 face interacting with gp41 in the native,  closed Env trimer present on HIV-1 virions or expressed on HIV-1 infected cells. Antibodies targeting this region are therefore non-neutralizing and their potential as mediators of antibody depended cellular cytoxicity (ADCC) of HIV-1 infected cells diminished by a lack of available binding targets. Here we present the design of Ab-CD4 chimeric proteins that consist of the Ab-IgG1 of a CoRBS or Cluster A specificity to the extracellular domain 1 and 2 of human CD4. Our Ab-CD4 hybrids induce potent ADCC against infected primary CD4+ T cells and neutralize tier 1 and 2 HIV-1 viruses. Furthermore, competition binding experiments reveal that the observed biological activities rely on both the antibody and CD4 moieties confirming their cooperativity in triggering conformational rearrangements of Env. Our data indicate the utility of these Ab-CD4 hybrids as antibody therapeutics effective in eliminating HIV-1 through the combined mechanisms of neutralization and ADCC. This is also the first report of single-chain-Ab-based molecules capable of opening  closed Env trimers on HIV-1 particles/infected cells to expose the Cluster A region and activate ADCC and neutralization against these non-neutralizing targets.\n\nImportanceHighly conserved epitopes within the co-receptor binding site (CoRBS) and constant region 1 and 2 (C1C2 or Cluster A) are only available for antibody recognition after the HIV-1 Env trimer binds host cell CD4, therefore they are not accessible on virions and infected cells where the expression of CD4 is downregulated. Here we have developed new antibody fusion molecules in which domains 1 and 2 of soluble human CD4 are linked with monoclonal antibodies of either the CoRBS or Cluster A specificity. We optimized the conjugation sites and linker lengths to allow each of these novel bispecific fusion molecules to recognize native \"closed\" Env trimers and induce the structural rearrangements required for exposure of the epitopes for antibody binding. Our in vitro functional testing shows that our Ab-CD4 molecules can efficiently target and eliminate HIV-1 infected cells through antibody depended cellular cytoxicity (ADCC) and inactivate HIV-1 virus through neutralization.",

    "abstract": "To overcome oxidative, inflammatory, and metabolic stress, cells have evolved networks of cytoprotective proteins controlled by nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its main negative regulator the Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1). Here, we used high-resolution mass-spectrometry to characterize the proteomes of macrophages with genetically altered Nrf2 status. Our analysis revealed significant differences among the genotypes in cellular metabolism and redox homeostasis, which we validated with respirometry and metabolomics, as well as in anti-viral immune pathways and the cell cycle. Nrf2 status significantly affected the proteome following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, with alterations in redox, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and innate immunity observed. Of note, Nrf2 activation was found to promote mitochondrial fusion in inflammatory macrophages. The Keap1 inhibitor, 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI), a derivative of the mitochondrial immunometabolite itaconate, remodeled the inflammatory macrophage proteome, increasing redox and suppressing anti-viral immune effectors in a Nrf2-dependent manner. These data suggest that Nrf2 activation facilitates metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial adaptation, and finetunes the innate immune response in macrophages.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=121 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/456204v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f5bbb8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f7311dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b9722forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f777d4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIFirst high-resolution proteome of macrophages with genetically altered Nrf2 status\nC_LIO_LINrf2 is key regulator of macrophage redox and intermediary metabolism\nC_LIO_LINrf2 finetunes the inflammatory response suppressing anti-viral immune and cytokine effectors, whilst promoting T cell activation factors\nC_LIO_LINrf2 regulates mitochondrial adaptation in inflammatory macrophages promoting the formation of a fused network\nC_LIO_LI4-octyl itaconate (4-OI) suppresses anti-viral immune effectors in inflammatory macrophages in a Nrf2-dependent manner\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are a phylogenetically diverse group of bacteria remarkable for their ability to biomineralize magnetite (Fe3O4) or greigite (Fe3S4) in organelles called magnetosomes. The majority of genes required for magnetosome formation are encoded by a magnetosome gene island (MAI). Most previous genetic studies in MTB have focused on the MAI, using screens to identify key MAI genes or targeted genetics to isolate specific genes and their function in one specific growth condition. Here, we conducted random barcoded transposon mutagenesis (RB-TnSeq) in Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 to identify the global genetic requirements for magnetosome formation under different growth conditions. We generated a library of 184,710 unique strains in a wild-type background, generating ~34 mutant strains for each gene. RB-TnSeq also allowed us to determine the essential gene set of AMB-1 under standard laboratory growth conditions. To pinpoint novel genes that are important for magnetosome formation, we subjected the library to magnetic selection screens in varied growth conditions. We compared biomineralization in standard growth conditions to biomineralization in high iron and anaerobic conditions, respectively. Strains with transposon insertions in the MAI gene mamT had an exacerbated biomineralization defect under both high iron and anerobic conditions compared to standard conditions, adding to our knowledge of the role of MamT in magnetosome formation. Mutants in amb4151, a gene outside of the MAI, are more magnetic than wild-type cells under anaerobic conditions. All three of these phenotypes were validated by creating a markerless deletion strain of the gene and evaluating with TEM imaging. Overall, our results indicate that growth conditions affect which genes are required for biomineralization and that some MAI genes may have more nuanced functions than was previously understood.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how microbial communities of aquatic ecosystems respond to environmental change remains a critical challenge in microbial ecology. In this study, we used phototrophic oxic-anoxic micro-ecosystems to understand how the functioning and diversity of aerobic and anaerobic lake analog communities is affected by light deprivation. Continuous measurements were performed to describe oxygen dynamics (mean/min/max/amplitude) and time-series of full-length 16S rRNA sequencing were used to quantify changes in alpha- and beta-diversity. In the top oxic layer, oxygen concentration decreased significantly under light deprivation, but showed resilience in mean, minimum and maximum after light conditions were restored. Only the amplitude of diurnal fluctuations in oxygen concentrations did not recover fully, and instead tended to remain lower in treated ecosystems. Alpha-diversity of the top oxic layer communities showed a delayed increase after light conditions were restored, and was not resilient. In contrast, alpha-diversity of the anoxic bottom layer communities increased due to the stressor, but was resilient. Community composition changed significantly during light deprivation, showed resilience in the oxic layer and lack of resilience in the anoxic layer. Alpha-diversity and the amplitude of oxygen within and among treatments were strongly correlated, suggesting that higher diversity could lead to less variable oxygen concentrations, or vice versa. Our experiment showed that light deprivation induces multifaceted responses of community function and structure, hence focusing on a single stability component could potentially be misleading.",

    "abstract": "Hfq, a bacterial RNA chaperone, stabilizes small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) and facilitates sRNA base-pairing with target mRNAs. Hfq has a conserved N-terminal domain and a poorly conserved disordered C-terminal domain (CTD). In a transcriptome-wide examination of the effects of a chromosomal CTD deletion (Hfq1-65), the Escherichia coli mutant was most defective for the accumulation of sRNAs that bind the proximal and distal faces of Hfq (Class II sRNAs), but other sRNAs also were affected. There were only modest effects on the levels of mRNAs, suggesting little disruption of sRNA-dependent regulation. However, cells expressing Hfq lacking the CTD deletion in combination with a weak distal face mutation were defective for the function of the Class II sRNA ChiX and repression of mutS, both dependent upon distal face RNA binding. Loss of the region between amino acids 66-72 was critical for this defect. The CTD region beyond amino acid 72 was not necessary for distal face-dependent regulation, but was needed for functions associated with the Hfq rim, seen most clearly in combination with a rim mutant. Our results suggest that the C-terminus collaborates in various ways with different binding faces of Hfq, leading to distinct outcomes for individual sRNAs.",

    "abstract": "RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) is a conserved mechanism that uses small RNAs (sRNAs) to tune gene expression. In C. elegans, exposure to dsRNA induces the production of gene-specific sRNAs that are propagated to progeny not exposed to the dsRNA trigger. We present evidence that RNAi inheritance is mediated by two parallel sRNA amplification loops. The first loop, dependent on the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, targets nascent transcripts, and reduces but does not eliminate productive transcription at the locus. The second loop, dependent on the conserved helicase ZNFX-1, targets mature transcripts and concentrates them in perinuclear condensates (nuage). Each amplification loop generates a distinct class of sRNAs, with the ZNFX-1 loop responsible for the bulk of sRNA production on the region targeted by the trigger. By independently targeting nascent and mature transcripts, the HRDE-1 and ZNFX-1 loops ensure maximum silencing in progeny not exposed to the trigger.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic recombination is triggered by programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs), a subset of these being repaired as crossovers, promoted by eight evolutionarily conserved proteins, named ZMM. Crossover formation is functionally linked to synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly between homologous chromosomes, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here we show that Ecm11, a SC central element protein, localizes on both DSB sites and sites that attach chromatin loops to the chromosome axis, which are the starting points of SC formation, in a way that strictly requires the ZMM protein Zip4. Furthermore, Zip4 directly interacts with Ecm11 and point mutants that specifically abolish this interaction lose Ecm11 binding to chromosomes and exhibit defective SC assembly. This can be partially rescued by artificially tethering interaction-defective Ecm11 to Zip4. Mechanistically, this direct connection ensuring SC assembly from CO sites could be a way for the meiotic cell to shut down further DSB formation once enough recombination sites have been selected for crossovers, thereby preventing excess crossovers. Finally, the mammalian ortholog of Zip4, TEX11, also interacts with the SC central element TEX12, suggesting a general mechanism.",

How Apq12 executes these functions is unknown. Here we identified a short amphipathic -helix (AH) in Apq12 that links the two transmembrane domains in the perinuclear space and has liposome-binding properties. Cells expressing an APQ12 (apq12-ah) version in which AH is disrupted show NPC biogenesis and NE integrity defects, without impacting upon Apq12-ah topology or NE/ER localization. Overexpression of APQ12 but not apq12-ah triggers striking over-proliferation of the outer nuclear membrane (ONM)/ER and promotes accumulation of phosphatidic acid (PA) at the NE. Apq12 and Apq12-ah both associate with NPC biogenesis intermediates and removal of AH increases both Brl1 levels and the interaction between Brl1 and Brr6. We conclude that the short amphipathic -helix of Apq12 regulates the function of Brl1 and Brr6 and promotes PA accumulation at the NE during NPC biogenesis.",

Both processes rely on mechanical forces (Lee et al., 2015; Nagamatsu et al., 2019; Rog and Dernburg, 2015; Sato et al., 2009; Tsatskis et al., 2020; Wynne et al., 2012), which can be transduced from the cytoskeleton to the nuclear envelope (NE) through linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes (Burke, 2018; Chang et al., 2015; Fan et al., 2020; Link et al., 2014). Gametes must protect their genomes from damage in this mechanically stressful environment. In C. elegans, oocyte nuclei lacking the single lamin protein LMN-1 are vulnerable to nuclear collapse. Here we deploy the auxin-inducible degradation system to investigate the balance of forces that drive this collapse and protect oocyte nuclei. We find that nuclear collapse is not a consequence of apoptosis. It is promoted by dynein and a LINC complex comprised of SUN-1 and ZYG-12, which assumes polarized distribution at the NE in response to dynein-mediated forces. We also show that the lamin meshwork works in parallel with other inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins to counteract mechanical stress at the NE during oogenesis. We speculate that a similar network may protect oocyte integrity during the long arrest period in mammals.",

    "abstract": "{gamma}-Tubulin complex acts as the predominant microtubule (MT) nucleator that initiates MT formation and is therefore an essential factor for cell proliferation. Nonetheless, cellular MTs are formed after experimental depletion of the {gamma}-tubulin complex, suggesting that cells possess other factors that drive MT nucleation. Here, by combining gene knockout, auxin-inducible degron, RNA interference, MT depolymerisation/regrowth assay, and live microscopy, we identified four microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), ch-TOG, CLASP1, CAMSAPs, and TPX2, which are involved in {gamma}-tubulin-independent MT generation in human colon cancer cells. In the mitotic MT regrowth assay, nucleated MTs organised non-centriolar MT organising centres (ncMTOCs) in the absence of {gamma}-tubulin. Depletion of CLASP1 or TPX2 substantially delayed ncMTOC formation, suggesting that they promote MT nucleation in the absence of {gamma}-tubulin. In contrast, depletion of CAMSAPs or ch-TOG did not affect the timing of ncMTOC appearance. CLASP1 also accelerates {gamma}-tubulin-independent MT regrowth during interphase. Thus, MT generation can be promoted by MAPs without the {gamma}-tubulin template.",

It plays a key role in fundamental cell processes, including ER stress mitigation, control of cell metabolism, and cell differentiation and proliferation, all of which are essential for cartilage cell (chondrocyte) development and survival, and for the formation of cartilage. Correspondingly, autophagy dysregulation has been implicated in several skeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis and osteoporosis. To test the requirement for autophagy during skeletal development in zebrafish, we generated an atg13 CRISPR knockout zebrafish line. This line showed a complete loss of atg13 expression, and restricted autophagic activity in vivo. In the absence of autophagy, chondrocyte maturation was accelerated, with chondrocytes exhibiting signs of premature hypertrophy. Focussing on the jaw element, autophagy disruption affected joint articulation causing restricted mouth opening. This gross behavioural phenotype corresponded with a failure to thrive, and death in homozygote atg13 nulls within 17 days. Taken together, our results are consistent with autophagy contributing to the timely regulation of chondrocyte maturation and for extracellular matrix formation.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian Hox gene clusters contain a range of CTCF binding sites. In addition to their importance in organizing a TAD border, which isolates the most posterior genes from the rest of the cluster, the positions and orientations of these sites suggest that CTCF may be instrumental in the selection of various subsets of contiguous genes, which are targets of distinct remote enhancers located in the flanking regulatory landscapes. We examined this possibility by producing an allelic series of cumulative in-cis mutations in these sites, up to the abrogation of CTCF binding in the five sites located on one side of the TAD border. In the most impactful alleles, the global chromatin architecture of the locus was modified, yet not drastically, illustrating that CTCF sites located on one side of a strong TAD border are sufficient to organize at least part of this insulation. Spatial colinearity in the expression of these genes along the major body axis was nevertheless maintained, despite abnormal expression boundaries. In contrast, strong effects were scored in the selection of target genes responding to particular enhancers, leading to the mis-regulation of Hoxd genes in specific structures. Altogether, while most enhancer-promoter interactions can occur in the absence of this series of CTCF sites, it seems that the binding of CTCF in the Hox cluster is required to properly transform a rather unprecise process into a highly discriminative mechanism of interactions, which is translated into various patterns of transcription accompanied by the distinctive chromatin topology found at this locus. Our allelic series also allowed us to reveal the distinct functional contributions for CTCF sites within this Hox cluster, some acting as insulator elements, others being necessary to anchor or stabilize enhancer-promoter interactions and some doing both, whereas all together contribute to the formation of a TAD border. This variety of tasks may explain the amazing evolutionary conservation in the distribution of these sites amongst paralogous Hox clusters or between various vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "DDX41 is a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in human myeloid neoplasms. DDX41 binds to DNA/RNA hybrids and interacts with spliceosome component (1, 2). How it affects hematopoiesis is still unclear. Using a knockout mouse model, we demonstrate that DDX41 is required for mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) survival and differentiation. Lack of DDX41 particularly affected myeloid progenitor development, starting at embryonic day 13.5. DDX41-deficient fetal liver and adult bone marrow (BM) cells were unable to rescue mice from lethal irradiation after transplantation. DDX41 knockout stem cells were also defective in ex vivo colony forming assays. RNASeq analysis of lineage-negative, cKit+Sca1+ cells isolated from fetal liver demonstrated that the expression of many genes associated with hematopoietic differentiation were altered in DDX41 knockout cells. Furthermore, altered splicing of genes involved in key biological processes were observed. Our data reveal a critical role for DDX41 in HSPC differentiation and myeloid progenitor development, likely through its regulation of gene expression programs and splicing.\n\nSignificanceDDX41 is a tumor suppressor in hematologic malignancies. However, whether DDX41 functions in hematopoiesis and myeloid cell differentiation is not known. Here we show that in mice, loss of DDX41 in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) leads to defects in hematopoietic development. The myeloid lineage was particularly affected as early as pre-natal stages. Transcriptional profiling of embryonic HSCs revealed that there were global changes in gene expression and splicing due to lack of DDX41. Collectively, the study uncovers a new function of DDX41 in HSC differentiation and could provide molecular targets for treatment of myeloid differentiation disorders.",

    "abstract": "Satellite DNA spans megabases of eukaryotic sequence and evolves rapidly. Paradoxically, satellite-rich genomic regions mediate strictly conserved, essential processes like chromosome segregation and nuclear structure. A leading resolution to this paradox posits that satellite DNA and satellite-associated chromosomal proteins coevolve to preserve these essential functions. We experimentally test this model of intra-genomic coevolution by conducting the first evolution-guided manipulation of both chromosomal protein and DNA satellite. The 359bp satellite spans an 11Mb array in D. melanogaster that is absent from its sister species, D. simulans. This species-specific DNA satellite colocalizes with the adaptively evolving, ovary-enriched protein, Maternal Haploid (MH)-the Drosophila homolog of Spartan. To determine if MH and 359 coevolve, we swapped the D. simulans version of MH (\"MH[sim]\") into D. melanogaster. MH[sim] triggers ovarian cell death, reduced ovary size, and loss of mature eggs. Surprisingly, the D. melanogaster mh null mutant has no such ovary phenotypes, suggesting that MH[sim] is toxic in a D. melanogaster background. Using both cell biology and genetics, we discovered that MH[sim] poisons oogenesis through a DNA damage pathway. Remarkably, deleting the D. melanogaster-specific 359 satellite array completely restores mh[sim] germline genome integrity and fertility, consistent with a history of coevolution between these two fast-evolving loci. Germline genome integrity and fertility are also restored by overexpressing Topoisomerase II (Top2), suggesting that MH[sim] interferes with Top2-mediated processing of 359. The observed 359-MH[sim] cross-species incompatibility supports a model under which ostensibly inert repetitive DNA and essential chromosomal proteins must coevolve to preserve germline genome integrity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSchistosoma mansoni is a flatworm that causes a neglected tropical disease affecting millions worldwide. Most flatworms are hermaphrodites but schistosomes have genotypically determined male (ZZ) and female (ZW) sexes. Sex is essential for pathology and transmission, however, the molecular determinants of sex remain unknown and is limited by poorly resolved sex chromosomes in previous genome assemblies.\n\nResultsWe assembled the 391.4 Mb S. mansoni genome into individual, single-scaffold chromosomes, including Z and W. Manual curation resulted in a vastly improved gene annotation, resolved gene and repeat arrays, trans-splicing, and almost all UTRs. The sex chromosomes each comprise pseudoautosomal regions and single sex-specific regions. The Z-specific region contains 932 genes, but on W all but 29 of these genes have been lost and the presence of five pseudogenes indicates that degeneration of W is ongoing. Synteny analysis reveals an ancient chromosomal fusion corresponding to the oldest part of Z, where only a single gene--encoding the large subunit of pre-mRNA splicing factor U2AF--has retained an intact copy on W. The sex-specific copies of U2AF have divergent N-termini and show sex-biased gene expression.\n\nConclusionOur assembly with fully resolved chromosomes provides evidence of an evolutionary path taken to create the Z and W sex chromosomes of schistosomes. Sex-linked divergence of the single U2AF gene, which has been present in the sex-specific regions longer than any other extant gene with distinct male and female specific copies and expression, may have been a pivotal step in the evolution of gonorchorism and genotypic sex determination of schistosomes.",

    "abstract": "Our current understanding of the regulation of gene expression in the early Drosophila melanogaster embryo comes from observations of a few genes at a time, as with in situ hybridizations, or observation of gene expression levels without regards to patterning, as with RNA-sequencing. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing however, has the potential to provide new insights into the regulation of gene expression for many genes at once while simultaneously retaining information regarding the position of each nucleus prior to dissociation based on patterned gene expression. In order to establish the practicality of single-nucleus RNA sequencing in the context of a real biological question, here we look at the difference in gene expression between control and an insulator protein, dCTCF, maternal null embryos during zygotic genome activation at nuclear cycle 14. We find that early embryonic nuclei can be grouped into distinct clusters according to gene expression. From both virtual and published in situ hybridizations, we also find that these clusters correspond to spatial regions of the embryo. Lastly, we present multiple examples of differential gene expression between control and maternal CTCF null nuclei in one or more clusters, but not in bulk when grouping expression across all nuclei. These results highlight the potential for single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to reveal new insights into the regulation of gene expression in the early Drosophila melanogaster embryo.",

    "abstract": "Some aspects of the neural mechanisms underlying mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are a useful model for the neurobiology of human speech and speech-related disorders. Much of the research on vocalizations and USVs is limited to offline methods and supervised classification of USVs, hindering the discovery of new types of vocalizations and the study of real-time free behavior. To address these issues, we developed AMVOC (Analysis of Mouse VOcal Communication) as a free, open-source software to analyze and detect USVs in both online and offline modes. When compared to hand-annotated ground-truth USV data, AMVOCs detection functionality (both offline and online) has high accuracy, and outperforms leading methods in noisy conditions, thus allowing for broader experimental use. AMVOC also includes the implementation of an unsupervised deep learning approach that facilitates discovery and analysis of USV data by clustering USVs using latent features extracted by a convolutional autoencoder and isimplemented in a graphical user interface (GUI), also enabling users evaluation. These results can be used to explore the vocal repertoire space of the analyzed vocalizations. In this way, AMVOC will facilitate vocal analyses in a broader range of experimental conditions and allow users to develop previously inaccessible experimental designs for the study of mouse vocal behavior.",

Three coffee drinks contained only sucrose. The orders of median glucose, fructose, and sucrose contents in categorized beverages containing sugars were as follows: for glucose, fruit juice > energy drink [&ge;] soda >> probiotic drink > black tea drink > sports drink; for fructose, probiotic drink [&ge;] energy drink > fruit juice > soda >> sports drink > black tea drink; and for sucrose, black tea drink > energy drink [&ge;] probiotic drink > fruit juice > soda > coffee drink >> sports drink. The rate of total fructose content in total sugar content in 38 sugar-containing beverages was approximately 40-60%.

    "abstract": "The study investigated the effect of 10% aqueous extracts of ginger (Zingiber officinale L.), garlic (Allium sativum L.) and onion (Allium cepa L.) on the quality of frozen chevon and pork as reflected by changes in values of 2-thiobartituric Acid Reactive Substances (2-TBARS), pH and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) over a 14 day storage under frozen conditions. Fresh samples each weighing 2 kg from chevon and pork were bought from the local slaughter houses in two locations 24hrs after slaughtering while ginger roots, garlic and onion bulbs were purchased from Mitundu local market in Lilongwe district, Malawi. The pH, total 2-TBARS and TVB-N of the thigh chevon and pork were measured from frozen storage at -20 {degrees}C after 14 days. The 10% aqueous extracts resulted in low pH values of 5.63, 5.79 and 5.67 at 14 d for chevon mixed with ginger, garlic and onion respectively. However, treated pork had higher pH content compared to treated chevon at 14 d. At day14 of frozen storage, the 2-TBARS expressed as mg MDA/kg meat, for chevon mixed with ginger, garlic and onion aqueous extracts were 2.62{+/-}0.01, 0 and 4.71{+/-}0.03 which was lower compared to the value of 5.93{+/-}0.01 for raw chevon. The TBARS values of chevon and pork mixed with ginger, garlic and onion and control chevon decreased from day 0 to 7 which eventually increased on 14 d. On 14 d, pork mixed with garlic extracts had lower TBARS value of 2.13{+/-}0.01 compared to 3.50{+/-}0.20, 2.26{+/-}0.01 and 3.92{+/-}0.01 for pork mixed with extracts of onion, ginger and control pork sample respectively. TVB-N, in mg/100g, was highest in control raw chevon and pork registering 95.70{+/-}0.32 and 84.00{+/-}0.40 at 14 d. Low values of TVB-N of 7.24{+/-}0.23, 12.37{+/-}0.23 and 16.61v{+/-}0.50 were registered in chevon mixed with aqueous extracts of ginger, garlic and onion compared to the values of 14.23{+/-}0.62, 22.87{+/-}0.47 and 18.86{+/-}0.14 for pork mixed with aqueous extracts of ginger, garlic and onion.

Leveraging a highly parallelized microfluidic platform for trapping and studying thousands of giant unilamellar vesicles, we conducted quantitative long-term microscopy studies to monitor the membrane-disruptive activity of archetypal antimicrobial peptides with a high spatiotemporal resolution. We described the modes of action of these peptides via measurements of the disruption of the vesicle population under the conditions of continuous peptide dosing using a range of concentrations, and related the observed modes with the molecular activity mechanisms of these peptides. The study offers an effective approach for characterizing membrane-targeting antimicrobial agents in a standardized manner, and for assigning specific modes of action to the corresponding antimicrobial mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Linker histones (LH) have been shown to preferentially bind to AT-rich DNA, particularly A-tracts, contiguous stretches of adenines. Using spFRET (single pair Forster/Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer), we recently found that the globular domain (gH) of Xenopus laevis H1.0b LH orients towards A-tracts on the linker-DNA (L-DNA) while binding on-dyad in LH:mononucleosome complexes. Here, we investigate the impact of this A-tract-mediated orientation of the gH on the compaction of higher-order structures by studying trinucleosomes as minimal models for chromatin. Two 600 bp DNA sequences were constructed, each containing three consecutive Widom 601 core sequences connected by about 40 bp L-DNA but differing in the positioning of A-tracts on either the outer or the inner L-DNAs flanking the first and third Widom 601 sequences. The two inner L-DNAs were fluorescently labelled at their midpoints. Trinucleosomes were reconstituted using the doubly labelled DNA, core histone octamers and H1.0b. SpFRET was performed for a range of NaCl concentrations to measure the compaction and whether gH orientations affected the stability of the trinucleosomes to salt-induced dissociation. While the LH compacted the trinucleosomes, the extent of compaction and the stability were similar for the two DNA sequences. Modeling constrained by the measured FRET efficiency suggests that the structures adopted by the trinucleosomes correspond to the standard zig-zagged two-helical start arrangement with the first and third nucleosomes stacked on top of each other. In this arrangement, the first and third LHs are insufficiently close to interact and affect compaction. Thus, despite differences in the positioning of the A-tracts in the sequences studied, LH binding compacts the corresponding trinucleosomes similarly.\n\nWhy it mattersThe compaction and three-dimensional structure of chromatin affect the exposure of the DNA and thus regulate gene expression. Linker histone proteins bind to nucleosomes and thereby contribute to chromatin compaction. We here investigated whether the DNA A-tract-mediated orientation of a linker histone globular domain affects chromatin structure by using a trinucleosome as a minimal model for chromatin. Our observations suggest that the trinucleosome structure and compaction are robust against differences in linker histone globular domain orientations.\n\neTOC blurbWe investigate whether DNA sequences, such as adenine-tracts, and sequence-induced linker histone reorientation affect chromatin structure. Using trinucleosomes as model systems for chromatin, we demonstrate that the chromatin structure and compaction are robust to the studied DNA sequence differences and sequence-induced linker histone orientation.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative differences in signal transduction are to date an understudied feature of tumour heterogeneity. The MAPK Erk pathway, which is activated in a large proportion of human tumours, is a prototypic example of distinct cell fates being driven by signal intensity. We have used primary hepatocyte precursors transformed with different dosages of an oncogenic form of Ras to model subclonal variations in MAPK signalling. Orthotopic allografts of Ras-transformed cells in immunocompromised mice gave rise to fast-growing aggressive tumours, both at the primary location and in the peritoneal cavity. Fluorescent labelling of cells expressing different oncogene levels, and consequently varying levels of MAPK Erk activation, highlighted the selection processes operating at the two sites of tumour growth. Indeed, significantly higher Ras expression was observed in primary as compared to metastatic tumours, despite the evolutionary trade-off of increased apoptotic death in the liver that correlated with high Ras dosage. Analysis of the immune tumoral microenvironment at the two locations suggests that fast metastatic growth in the immunocompromised setting is abrogated in immunocompetent animals due to efficient antigen presentation by peritoneal dendritic cells. Furthermore, our data indicate that, in contrast to the metastatic outgrowth, strong MAPK signalling is required in the primary liver tumours to resist elimination by NK cells. Overall, this study describes a quantitative aspect of tumour heterogeneity and highlights potential vulnerability of a subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma as a function of MAPK Erk signalling intensity.",

    "abstract": "The programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), also known as CD274 or B7-H1, is mainly expressed on cancer cells and/or immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and plays an essential role in tumor progression and immune escape. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have shown impressive clinical success, however, the majority of the patients do not respond to immune checkpoint therapy (ICT). Thus, to overcome ICT resistance there is a high need for potent and novel strategies that simultaneously target both tumor cells and immunosuppressive cells in the TME. In this study, we show that the intracellular light-controlled drug delivery method photochemical internalization (PCI) induce specific and strongly enhanced cytotoxic effects of the PD-L1-targeting immunotoxin, anti-PD-L1-saporin (Anti-PDL1-SAP), in the PD-L1+ triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell line, while no enhanced efficacy was obtained in the PD-L1 negative control cell line MDA-MB-453. Using fluorescence microscopy, we reveal that the anti-PD-L1 antibody binds to PD-L1 on the surface of the MDA-MD-231 cells and overnight accumulates in late endosomes and lysosomes where it co-localizes with the PCI photosensitizer fimaporfin (TPCS2a). Moreover, light-controlled endosomal/lysosomal escape of the anti-PD-L1 antibody and fimaporfin into the cytosol was obtained. We also confirm that the breast MDA-MB-468 and the prostate PC-3 and DU-145 cancer cell lines have subpopulations with PD-L1 expression. In addition, we show that interferon-gamma strongly induce PD-L1 expression in the per se PD-L1 negative CT26.WT cells and enhance the PD-L1 expression in MC-38 cells, of which both are murine colon cancer cell lines. In conclusion, our work provides an in vitro proof-of-concept of PCI-enhanced targeting and eradication of PD-L1 positive immunosuppressive cells. This light-controlled combinatorial strategy has a potential to advance cancer immunotherapy and should be explored in preclinical studies.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanism underlying sexual reproduction in land plants is well understood in model plants and is a target for crop improvement. However, unlike land plants, the genetic basis involved in triggering reproduction and gamete formation remains elusive in most seaweeds, which are increasingly viewed as an alternative source of functional food and feedstock for energy applications. Here, gametogenesis of Ulva mutabilis, a model organism for green seaweeds, is studied. We analyze transcriptome dynamics at different time points during gametogenesis following induction of reproduction by fragmentation and removal of sporulation inhibitors. Analyses demonstrate that 45% of the genes in the genome are differentially expressed during gametogenesis. We identified several transcription factors that potentially play a key role in the early gametogenesis of Ulva given the function of their homologs in higher plants and microalgae. In particular, the detailed expression pattern of an evolutionary conserved transcription factor containing an RWP-RK domain suggests a key role during Ulva gametogenesis. The identification of putative master regulators of gametogenesis provides a starting point for further functional characterization.\n\nHighlightTranscriptomic analyses of gametogenesis in the green seaweed Ulva highlight the importance of a conserved RWP-RK transcription factor in induction of sexual reproduction.",

First, metabolic regulation controls metabolic fluxes (i.e., the rate of individual metabolic reactions) through the interactions of metabolites (substrates, cofactors, allosteric modulators) with the responsible enzyme. A second regulatory layer sets the maximal theoretical level for each enzyme-controlled reaction by controlling the expression level of the catalyzing enzyme. In isolation, high-throughput data, such as metabolomics and transcriptomics data do not allow for accurate characterization of the hierarchical regulation of metabolism outlined above. Hence, they must be integrated in order to disassemble the interdependence between different regulatory layers controlling metabolism. To this aim, we proposes INTEGRATE, a computational pipeline that integrates metabolomics (intracellular and optionally extracellular) and transcriptomics data, using constraint-based stoichiometric metabolic models as a scaffold. We compute differential reaction expression from transcriptomic data and use constraint-based modeling to predict if the differential expression of metabolic enzymes directly originates differences in metabolic fluxes. In parallel, we use metabolomics to predict how differences in substrate availability translate into differences in metabolic fluxes. We discriminate fluxes regulated at the metabolic and/or gene expression level by intersecting these two output datasets. We demonstrate the pipeline using a set of immortalized normal and cancer breast cell lines. In a clinical setting, knowing the regulatory level at which a given metabolic reaction is controlled will be valuable to inform targeted, truly personalized therapies in cancer patients.\n\nAuthor summaryThe study of metabolism and its regulation finds increasing application in various fields, including biotransformations, wellness, and health. Metabolism can be studied using post-genomic technologies, notably transcriptomics and metabolomics, that provide snapshots of transcripts and metabolites in specific physio-pathological conditions. In the health field, the transcriptome and, more recently, the metabolome have been broadly profiled at the pre-clinical and clinical levels. The informative power of single omic technologies is inadequate since metabolism regulation involves a complex interplay of regulatory steps. While gene expression regulates metabolism by setting the upper level of metabolic enzymes, the interaction of metabolites with metabolic enzymes directly auto-regulates metabolism. Therefore there is a need for methods that integrate multiple data sources. We present INTEGRATE, a computational pipeline that captures dynamic features from the static snapshots provided by transcriptomic and metabolomic data. Through integration in a steady-state metabolic model, the pipeline predicts which reactions are controlled purely by metabolic control rather than by gene expression or a combination of the two. This knowledge is crucial in a clinical setting to develop personalized therapies in patients of multifactorial diseases, such as cancer. Besides cancer, INTEGRATE can be applied to different fields in which metabolism plays a driving role.",

    "abstract": "Optimal control simulations have shown that both musculoskeletal dynamics and physiological noise are important determinants of movement. However, due to the limited efficiency of available computational tools, deterministic simulations of movement focus on accurately modelling the musculoskeletal system while neglecting physiological noise, and stochastic simulations account for noise while simplifying the dynamics. We took advantage of recent approaches where stochastic optimal control problems are approximated using deterministic optimal control problems, which can be solved efficiently using direct collocation. We were thus able to extend predictions of stochastic optimal control as a theory of motor coordination to include muscle coordination and movement patterns emerging from non-linear musculoskeletal dynamics. In stochastic optimal control simulations of human standing balance, we demonstrated that the inclusion of muscle dynamics can predict muscle co-contraction as minimal effort strategy that complements sensorimotor feedback control in the presence of sensory noise. In simulations of reaching, we demonstrated that nonlinear multi-segment musculoskeletal dynamics enables complex perturbed and unperturbed reach trajectories under a variety of task conditions to be predicted. In both behaviors, we demonstrated how interactions between task constraint, sensory noise, and the intrinsic properties of muscle influence optimal muscle coordination patterns, including muscle co-contraction, and the resulting movement trajectories. Our approach enables a true minimum effort solution to be identified as task constraints, such as movement accuracy, can be explicitly imposed, rather than being approximated using penalty terms in the cost function. Our approximate stochastic optimal control framework predicts complex features, not captured by previous simulation approaches, providing a generalizable and valuable tool to study how musculoskeletal dynamics and physiological noise may alter neural control of movement in both healthy and pathological movements.",

    "abstract": "It is well admitted that children and older adults tend to show longer response latencies at the Stroop task than young adults. The present study aims at clarifying the rational of such changes from childhood to adulthood and in ageing by comparing the impacted cognitive processes across age groups. More precisely, the aim was to clarify if all processes take more time to be executed, hence implying that longer latencies rely mainly on processing speed or if an additional process lengthens the resolution of the conflict in children and/or older adults. To this aim we recorded brain electrical activity using EEG in school-age children, young and older adults while they performed a classic verbal Stroop task. To decompose the signal in the underlying brain networks, we used microstates analyses and compared congruent, incongruent and neutral trials across the three age-groups. Behaviorally, children and older adults presented longer latencies and larger Stroop effects relative to young adults. The microstates results showed that children tend to present different brain configurations compared to both adult groups, even though some brain configurations remained identical among the three groups. In particular, additional brain networks were involved in children to perform the Stroop task, which party account for the longer latencies in this group. By contrast, in aging the results favor the general slowing hypothesis rather than a decline in a specific process since all involved brain networks were similar in the two adult groups but slowed down in the older one.",

    "abstract": "First synthesized in the 1950s, benzodiazepines are widely prescribed drugs that exert their anxiolytic, sedative and anticonvulsant actions by binding to GABA-A receptors, the main inhibitory ligand-gated ion channel in the brain. Scientists have long theorized that there exists an endogenous benzodiazepine, or endozepine, in the brain. While there is indirect evidence suggesting a peptide, the diazepam binding inhibitor, is capable of modulating the GABA-A receptor, direct evidence of the modulatory effects of the diazepam binding inhibitor is limited.\n\nHere we take a reductionist approach to understand how purified diazepam binding inhibitor interacts with and affects GABA-A receptor activity. We used two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology to study how the effects of diazepam binding inhibitor vary with GABA-A receptor subunit composition, and found that GABA-evoked currents from 3-containing GABA-A receptors are weakly inhibited by the diazepam binding inhibitor, while currents from 5-containing receptors are positively modulated. We also used in silico protein-protein docking to visualize potential diazepam binding inhibitor/GABA-A receptor interactions that revealed diazepam binding inhibitor bound at the benzodiazepine /{gamma} binding site interface, which provides a structural framework for understanding diazepam binding inhibitor effects on GABA-A receptors. Our results provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying how the diazepam binding inhibitor modulates GABA-mediated inhibition in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Macroscopic oscillations in the brain have been observed to be involved in many cognitive tasks but their role is not completely understood. One of the suggested functions of the oscillations is to dynamically modulate communication between neural circuits. The Communication Through Coherence (CTC) theory establishes that oscillations reflect rhythmic changes in excitability of the neuronal populations. Thus, populations need to be properly phase-locked so that input volleys arrive at the peaks of excitability of the receiving population to communicate effectively. Here, we present a modeling study to explore synchronization between neuronal circuits connected with unidirectional projections. We consider an Excitatory-Inhibitory (E-I) network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons modeling a Pyramidal-Interneuronal Network Gamma (PING) rhythm. The network receives an external periodic input from either one or two sources, simulating the inputs from other oscillating neural groups. We use recently developed mean-field models which provide an exact description of the macroscopic activity of the spiking network. This low-dimensional mean field model allows us to use tools from bifurcation theory to identify the phase-locked states between the input and the target population as a function of the amplitude, frequency and coherence of the inputs. We identify the conditions for optimal phaselocking and selective communication. We find that inputs with high coherence can entrain the network for a wider range of frequencies. Besides, faster oscillatory inputs than the intrinsic network gamma cycle show more effective communication than inputs with similar frequency. Our analysis further shows that the entrainment of the network by inputs with higher frequency is more robust to distractors, thus giving them an advantage to entrain the network. Finally, we show that pulsatile inputs can switch between attended inputs in selective attention.\n\nAuthor summaryOscillations are ubiquitous in the brain and are involved in several cognitive tasks but their role is not completely understood. The Communication Through Coherence theory proposes that background oscillations in the brain regulate the information flow between neural populations. The oscillators that are properly phase-locked so that inputs arrive at the peaks of excitability of the receiving population communicate effectively. In this paper, we study the emerging phase-locking patterns of a network generating PING oscillations under external periodic forcing, simulating the oscillatory input from other neural groups. We identify the conditions for optimal phase-locking and selective communication. Namely, we find that inputs with higher frequency and coherence have an adavantage to entrain the network and we quantify how robust are to distractors. Furthermore, we show how selective attention can be implemented by means of phase locking and we show that pulsatile inputs can switch between attended inputs.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, which is an unexpectedly associated with congenital defects, has prompted the development of safe and effective vaccines. The gram-positive enhancer matrix-protein anchor (GEM-PA) display system has emerged as a versatile and highly effective platform for delivering target proteins for vaccines. In this article, we developed a bacterium-like particle vaccine ZI-{Delta}-PA-GEM based on the GEM-PA system. The fusion protein ZI-{Delta}-PA, which contains the prM-E-{Delta} protein of ZIKV (with a stem-transmembrane region deletion) and the protein anchor PA3, was expressed. The fusion protein was successfully displayed on the GEM surface, forming ZI-{Delta}-PA-GEM. Moreover, when BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly with ZI-{Delta}-PA-GEM combined with 201 VG and poly(I:C) adjuvants, durable ZIKV-specific IgG and protective neutralizing antibody responses were induced. Potent B cell/DC activation was also be stimulated early after immunization. Remarkably, splenocyte proliferation, the secretion of multiple cytokines, T/B cell activation and central memory T cell responses were elicited. These data indicate that ZI-{Delta}-PA-GEM is a promising bacterium-like particle vaccine candidate for ZIKV.\n\nAuthor summaryBecause Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is considered as an example of \"disease X\", the development of a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine is essential. The gram-positive enhancer matrix-protein anchor (GEM-PA) display system has been used in many vaccine studies due to its advantages. In this study, prM-E-{bigtriangleup} protein of ZIKV (with a stem-transmembrane region deletion) and the protein anchor PA3 was fusion expressed, termed ZI-{bigtriangleup}-PA. Then the fusion protein ZI-{bigtriangleup}-PA could be displayed on the surface of GEM, forming ZI-{bigtriangleup}-PA-GEM. The author evaluated the immunogenicity of ZI-{bigtriangleup}-PA-GEM with the 201 VG and poly(I:C) adjuvants. The study demonstrates that ZI-{bigtriangleup}-PA-GEM induced mice to produce neutralizing antibody and specific cellular immune responses. The author believe that the bacterium-like particle vaccine ZI-{bigtriangleup}-PA-GEM has the potential to be used as the ZIKV vaccine.",

    "abstract": "Agaricus bisporus is widely used on the world market. The easy browning of mushroom surface is one of the most intuitive factors affecting consumer purchase. A certain cognition on browning mechanism have been made after years of research. At present, people slow down the browning of mushrooms mainly by improving preservation methods. In addition, breeding is also a reliable way. In the production practice, we have identified some browning resistant varieties,and we selected a browning-resistant variety to compare with ordinary variety to reveal the resistance mechanism. Using transcriptomics and metabolomics, the differences in gene expression and metabolite levels were revealed, respectively. The results showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) like AbPPO4, AbPPO3 and AbPPO2 were differently expressed and these DEGs involved in many pathways that related to browning. The expression of AbPPO expression play an important role in the browning of A. bisporus and multiple PPO family members are involved in the regulation of browning. However, the resistance to browning cannot be judged only by the expression level of AbPPOs. Formetabolomics, most of the different metabolites were organic acids. These organic acids had a higher level in anti-browning (BT) than easy-browning varieties (BS), although the profile was very heterogeneous. On the contrary, the content of trehalose in BS was significantly higher than that in BT. Higher organic acids decreased pH and further inhibited PPO activity. In addition, the BS had a higher content of trehalose, which might play roles in maintain the activity of PPO. The difference of browning resistance between BS and BT is mainly due to the differential regulation mechanism of PPO.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus mutans is a gram-positive bacterium in the oral cavity that is most implicated in the dental caries progression. The condition is very expensive to manage and the most commonly used products such as fluoride tooth pastes and alcohol-based mouth washes are associated with many side effects. The current study therefore focused on providing a scientific evidence to guide the use of a combination of Eriobotrya japonica (EJ) and Callistemon citrinus (CC) as actives in development of an effective and cheaper herbal formulation for management of dental caries. The objective of this study was to determine antimicrobial interactions of Eriobotrya japonica and Callistemon citrinus phytoextracts proportions against Streptococcus mutans bacteria. The leaves of both plants (EJ and CC) were shade-dried and pulverized into a coarse powder which were then cold macerated using ethanol (60 %) for 24 h. Phytochemical screening was conducted for the two dry extracts obtained after fan drying before they were mixed in to five different proportions (1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3 and 0:1). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) assays against Streptococcus mutans were done for all the proportions above with ciprofloxacin and 2.5 % Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the positive and negative controls respectively. Antimicrobial interactions between the two extracts were also evaluated using Fractional Inhibitory and Bacterial Concentration Indices (FICI/FBCI). Results showed that EJ and CC had percentage yields of 20.05 % and 15.45 % respectively. All the extracts showed similar phytochemical profiles. They also demonstrated an inhibitory effect on Streptococcus mutans with MIC and MBC values ranging from 521 to 3333 g/ml and 1042 to 3667 g/ml respectively. However, CC: EJ (1:0) had the lowest MIC and MBC comparable to that of the standard drug at P <0.05. The FICI/FBCI were between 1.5 and 3.917. Therefore, CC: EJ (1:0) proportion markedly demonstrated better antimicrobial activity against the test organism and there are no beneficial antimicrobial interactions between the two plant extracts to inform their combination as actives for dental caries product formulation.",

In order to gain deeper insight into how exposure to bypass activates inflammatory responses in circulating leukocytes, we studied changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression during and after exposure to bypass. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that have important roles in modulating protein levels and function of cells.\n\nMethodsWe performed miRNA-Sequencing on leukocytes isolated from neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass patients (N=5) at 7 timepoints during the process of CPB, including prior to the initiation of bypass, during bypass, and at three time points during the first 24 hours after weaning from bypass. We identified significant differentially expressed miRNAs using generalized linear regression models, and miRNAs were defined as statistically significant using an FDR adjusted p <0.05. We identified gene targets of these miRNAs using the Targetscan database, and identified significantly enriched biological pathways for these gene targets.\n\nResultsWe identified 54 miRNAs with differential expression during and after CPB. These miRNAs clustered into 3 groups, including miRNAs that were increased during and after CPB (3 miRNAs), miRNAs that decreased during and after CPB (10 miRNAs), and miRNAs that decreased during CPB but then increased 8-24 hours after CPB. 38.9% of the target genes of these miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in our previous study. miRNAs with altered expression levels are predicted to significantly modulate pathways related to inflammation and signal transduction.\n\nConclusionsThe unbiased profiling of the miRNA changes that occur in the circulating leukocytes of bypass patients provides deeper insight into the mechanisms that underpin the systemic inflammatory response that occurs in patients after exposure to cardiopulmonary bypass. These data will help the development of novel treatments and biomarkers for bypass associated inflammation.",

This suggests that the pigs affective state may be altered during gestation, although as a non-pregnant control group was not tested, an effect of learning cannot be ruled out. These results suggest that judgement bias is altered during pregnancy in domestic pigs, consequently raising novel welfare considerations for captive multiparous species.",

    "abstract": "Physics-based predictive simulations have been shown to capture many salient features of human walking. Yet they often fail to produce realistic stance knee mechanics and terminal stance ankle plantarflexion. While the influence of the performance criterion on the predicted walking pattern has been previously studied, the influence of the mechanics has been less explored. Here, we investigated the influence of two mechanical assumptions on the predicted walking pattern: the complexity of the foot segment and the stiffness of the Achilles tendon. We found, through three-dimensional muscle-driven predictive simulations of walking, that modeling the toes and metatarsophalangeal joints, and thus using two-segment instead of single-segment foot models, contributed to robustly eliciting physiological stance knee flexion angles, knee extension torques, and knee extensor activity. Yet modeling toe joints did not improve ankle kinematics, nor did decreasing the Achilles tendon stiffness. The lack of predicted terminal stance ankle plantarflexion thereby remains an open question. Overall, this simulation study shows that not only the performance criterion but also mechanical assumptions affect predictive simulations of walking. Improving the realism of predictive simulations is required for their application in clinical contexts. Here, we suggest that using complex models is needed to yield such realism.",

We curated key metadata of 16 SCD studies in a three-tiered conceptual framework of category, subcategory, and data element using ontologies and controlled vocabularies to organize the study variables. We developed the CureSCi MDC by indexing study metadata to enable effective browse and search capabilities at three levels: study, Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) Measures, and data element levels.\n\nResultsThe CureSCi MDC offers several browse and search tools to discover studies by study level, PRO Measures, and data elements. The \"Browse Studies,\" \"Browse Studies by PRO Measures,\" and \"Browse Studies by Data Elements\" tools allow users to identify studies through pre-defined conceptual categories. \"Search by Keyword\" and \"Search Data Element by Concept Category\" can be used separately or in combination to provide more granularity to refine the search results. This resource helps investigators find information about specific data elements across studies using public browsing/search tools, before going through data request procedures to access controlled datasets. The MDC makes SCD studies more Findable through browsing/searching study information, PRO Measures, and data elements, aiding in the reuse of existing SCD data.",

    "abstract": "Despite major advances made in malaria treatment and control over recent decades, the development of new models for studying disease pathogenesis remains a vital part of malaria research efforts. The study of malaria infection during pregnancy is particularly reliant on mouse models, as a means of circumventing many challenges and costs associated with pregnancy studies in endemic human populations. Here, we introduce three novel murine models that will further our understanding of how post-implantation and midgestional malaria infection affects pregnancy outcomes. When C57BL/6J (B6) mice are infected with Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi AS on either embryonic day (E) 6.5, 8.5, or 10.5, preterm birth occurs in all animals by E16.5, E17.5, or E18.5 respectively, with no evidence of intrauterine growth restriction. We found that the time to delivery, placental inflammatory and antioxidant transcript upregulation, and the relationships between parasitemia and transcript expression prior to preterm birth are different based on the embryonic day of infection. On the day before preterm delivery, E6.5 infected mice did not experience significant upregulation of the inflammatory or antioxidant gene transcripts examined; however, parasitemia correlated positively with Il1{beta}, Cox1, and Hmox1 placental transcript abundance. E8.5 infected mice had elevated transcripts for Ifn{gamma}, Tnf, Il10, Cox1, Cox2, Sod1, Sod2, Cat, and Nrf2, while Sod3 was the only transcript that correlated with parasitemia. Finally, E10.5 infected mice had elevated transcripts for Ifn{gamma} only, with a tendency for Tnf transcripts to correlate with parasitemia. Tumor necrosis factor deficient (TNF-/-) and TNF receptor 1 deficient (TNFR1-/-) mice infected on E8.5 experienced preterm birth at the same time as B6 controls. Further characterization of these models is necessary to discover new and/or existing mechanism(s) or trigger(s) responsible for malaria-driven preterm birth that is determined by gestational age upon maternal infection, parasite-host dynamics, or both.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSystematic, long-term, and spatially representative monitoring of insecticide resistance in mosquito populations is urgently needed to quantify its impact on malaria transmission, and to combat failing interventions when resistance emerges. Resistance assays on wild-caught adult mosquitoes (known as adult-capture) offer an alternative to the current protocols, and can be done cheaply, in a shorter time frame, and in the absence of an insectary. However, quantitative assessments of the performance of these assays relative to the gold standard, which involves rearing larvae in an insectary, are lacking.\n\nMethodology/Principal findingsWe developed a discrete-time deterministic mosquito lifecycle model to simulate insecticide resistance assays from adult-captured mosquito collection in a heterogeneous environment compared to the gold standard larval capture methods, and to quantify possible biases in the results. We incorporated non-lethal effects of insecticide exposure that have been demonstrated in laboratory experiments, spatial structure, and the impact of multiple exposure to insecticides and natural ageing on mosquito death rates during the assay. Using output from this model, we compared the results of these assays to true resistance as measured by the presence of the resistance allele. In simulated samples of 100 test mosquitoes, reflecting WHO-recommended sample sizes, we found that compared to adult-captured assays (MSE = 0.0059), larval-captured assays were a better measure of true resistance (MSE = 0.0018). Using a correction model, we were able to improve the accuracy of the adult-captured assay results (MSE = 0.0038). Bias in the adult-capture assays was dependent on the level of insecticide resistance rather than coverage of bed nets or spatial structure.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceUsing adult-captured mosquitoes for resistance assays has logistical advantages over the standard larval-capture collection, and may be a more accurate sample of the mosquito population. These results show that adult-captured assays can be improved using a simple mathematical approach and used to inform resistance monitoring programs.\n\nAuthor SummaryGrowing insecticide resistance in the mosquitoes that transmit malaria necessitates more widespread monitoring. Conducting assays on mosquitoes captured as adults is logistically simpler than raising them from eggs or larvae, the current recommended practice. However, this method is not widely used because survival when exposed to insecticide is known to depend on age and history of previous history as well as genetic resistance-factors that cannot be controlled when testing wild-caught adults. Here, we developed a mathematical model to quantify the difference in resistance measured via adult-capture assays compared to the gold standard larval-capture assays. We find that adult-capture assay results can be easily corrected using a formula based only on the measured resistance. This result has the potential to expand access to monitoring by reducing the time and infrastructure required to conduct these tests.",

    "abstract": "Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) are valuable tools for understanding microbial community metabolism. The process of automatically generating GENREs includes identifying metabolic reactions supported by sufficient genomic evidence to generate a draft metabolic network. The draft GENRE is then gapfilled with additional reactions in order to recapitulate specific growth phenotypes as indicated with associated experimental data. Previous methods have implemented absolute mapping thresholds for the reactions automatically included in draft GENREs; however, there is growing evidence that integrating annotation evidence in a continuous form can improve model accuracy. There is a need for flexibility in the structure of GENREs to better account for uncertainty in biological data, unknown regulatory mechanisms, and context specificity associated with data inputs. To address this issue, we present a novel method that provides a framework for quantifying combined genomic, biochemical, and phenotypic evidence for each biochemical reaction during automated GENRE construction. Our method, Constraint-based Analysis Yielding reaction Usage across metabolic Networks (CANYUNs), generates accurate GENREs with a quantitative metric for the cumulative evidence for each reaction included in the network. The structure of a CANYUN GENRE allows for the simultaneous integration of three data inputs while maintaining all supporting evidence for biochemical reactions that may be active in an organism. CANYUNs is designed to maximize the utility of experimental and annotation datasets and to ultimately assist in the curation of the reference datasets used for the automatic reconstruction of metabolic networks. We validated CANYUNs by generating an E. coli K-12 model and compared it to the manually curated reconstruction iML1515. Finally, we demonstrated the use of CANYUNs to build a model by generating an E. coli Nissle CANYUN GENRE using novel phenotypic data that we collected. This method may address key challenges for the procedural construction of metabolic networks by leveraging uncertainty and redundancy in biological data.",
