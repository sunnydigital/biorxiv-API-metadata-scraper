    "abstract": "Dead End (DND1) is an RNA-binding protein essential for germline development through its role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. The molecular mechanisms behind selection and regulation of its targets are unknown. Here, we present the solution structure of DND1s tandem RNA Recognition Motifs (RRMs) bound to AU-rich RNA. The structure reveals how an NYAYUNN element is specifically recognized, reconciling seemingly contradictory sequence motifs discovered in recent genome-wide studies. RRM1 acts as a main binding platform, including atypical extensions to the canonical RRM fold. RRM2 acts cooperatively with RRM1, capping the RNA using an unusual binding pocket, leading to an unprecedented mode of tandem RRM-RNA recognition. We show that the consensus motif is sufficient to mediate upregulation of a reporter gene in human cells and that this process depends not only on RNA binding by the RRMs, but also on DND1s double-stranded RNA binding domain (dsRBD), which is dispensable for target binding in cellulo. Our results point to a model where DND1 target selection is mediated by a non-canonical mode of AU-rich RNA recognition by the tandem RRMs and a role for the dsRBD in the recruitment of effector complexes responsible for target regulation.",

In contrast to other similar commercial software using algorithms based on non-linear regression models to reach these results, Easy Kinetics is based on a completely different original algorithm, requiring in input the spectrophotometric measurements of {Delta}Abs/min taken twice at only two different substrate concentrations.

    "abstract": "It is well established that head motion and physiological processes (e.g. cardiac and breathing activity) should be taken into consideration when analyzing and interpreting results in fMRI studies. However, even though recent studies aimed to evaluate the performance of different preprocessing pipelines there is still no consensus on the optimal strategy. This is partly due to the fact that the quality control (QC) metrics used to evaluate differences in performance across pipelines have often yielded contradictory results. Furthermore, preprocessing techniques based on physiological recordings or data decomposition techniques (e.g. aCompCor) have not been comprehensively examined. Here, to address the aforementioned issues, we propose a framework that summarizes the scores from eight previously proposed and novel QC metrics to a reduced set of two QC metrics that reflect the signal-to-noise ratio and the reduction in motion artifacts and biases in the preprocessed fMRI data. Using this framework, we evaluate the performance of three commonly used practices on the quality of data: 1) Removal of nuisance regressors from fMRI data, 2) discarding motion-contaminated volumes (i.e., scrubbing) before regression, and 3) low-pass filtering the data and the nuisance regressors before their removal. Using resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, we show that the scores of the examined QC metrics improve the most when the global signal (GS) and about 17% of principal components from white matter (WM) are removed from the data. Finally, we observe a small further improvement with low-pass filtering at 0.20 Hz and milder variants of WM denoising, but not with scrubbing.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyses the conditions for local adaptation in a metapopulation with infinitely many islands under a model of hard selection, where population size depends on local fitness. Each island belongs to one of two distinct ecological niches or habitats. Fitness is influenced by an additive trait which is under habitat-dependent directional selection. Our analysis is based on the diffusion approximation and accounts for both genetic drift and demographic stochasticity. By neglecting linkage disequilibria, it yields the joint distribution of allele frequencies and population size on each island. We find that under hard selection, the conditions for local adaptation in a rare habitat are more restrictive for more polygenic traits: even moderate migration load per locus at very many loci is sufficient for population sizes to decline. This further reduces the efficacy of selection at individual loci due to increased drift and because smaller populations are more prone to swamping due to migration, causing a positive feedback between increasing maladaptation and declining population sizes. Our analysis also highlights the importance of demographic stochasticity, which exacerbates the decline in numbers of maladapted populations, leading to population collapse in the rare habitat at significantly lower migration than predicted by deterministic arguments.",

    "abstract": "To perform a task continuously over an extended period of time, it is necessary to maintain an adequate level of arousal. In cognitive research, traditional studies have used repetitive, monotonous tasks to learn about the dynamics of arousal in tasks that require sustained vigilance, such as driving or monitoring a factory line. To date, studies have rarely considered whether observers use task-embedded regularities in such continuous contexts to anticipate events and regulate arousal accordingly. In the current study, we explored whether arousal is an adaptive process that reacts to temporal stimulus predictability. Across two experiments, we used pupillometry as a proxy measure of arousal in human observers performing continuous tasks. Within the tasks, we manipulated the temporal predictability of relevant events by presenting stimuli either in a fixed rhythm or at varied intervals. Temporal predictability led to the lowering of tonic levels of arousal. Trial-wise temporal structures led to short-scale changes in pupil size related to temporal anticipation. Accordingly, we suggest that arousal is sensitive to varying levels of temporal predictability and dynamically adapts to task demands to bring about performance benefits as well as energetic efficiencies overall.\n\nStatement of RelevancePeople often have to sustain focus and high levels of performance on extended and non-stimulating tasks (e.g., driving, sowing, monitoring data acquisition). A critical factor to the success (or failure) in sustained performance is arousal - the  energetic state of the cognitive system. Here we used pupil dilation as a proxy to study levels of arousal during sustained performance on monotonous tasks. We reveal that arousal is dynamically regulated to support performance according to an important fundamental property of any task: its temporal structure. When the timing of task-relevant events is predictable, arousal levels fluctuate accordingly, saving energy overall while also optimally guiding performance. Our study and findings add ecological validity to the study of temporal expectations, by moving investigations beyond typical trial-by-trial designs. They also carry significant implications for clinical studies relying on sustained performance tasks.",

    "abstract": "Despite intensive research on the biochemical and regulatory features of the archetypal catabolic TOL system borne by pWW0 of Pseudomonas putida mt-2, the physical arrangement and tridimensional logic of the xyl gene expression flow remains unknown. In this work, the spatial distribution of specific xyl mRNAs with respect to the host nucleoid, the TOL plasmid and the ribosomal pool has been investigated. In situ hybridization of target transcripts with fluorescent oligonucleotide probes revealed that xyl mRNAs cluster in discrete foci, adjacent but clearly separated from the TOL plasmid and the cell nucleoid. Also, they co-localize with ribosome-rich domains of the intracellular milieu. This arrangement was kept even when the xyl genes were artificially relocated at different chromosomal locations. The same happened when genes were expressed through a heterologous T7 polymerase-based system, which originated mRNA foci outside the DNA. In contrast, rifampicin treatment, known to ease crowding, blurred the confinement of xyl transcripts. This suggested that xyl mRNAs intrinsically run away from their initiation sites to ribosome-rich points for translation--rather than being translated coupled to transcription. Moreover, the results suggest that the distinct subcellular motion of xyl mRNAs results both from innate properties of the sequence at stake and the physical forces that keep the ribosomal pool away from the nucleoid in P. putida. This scenario is discussed on the background of current knowledge on the 3D organization of the gene expression flow in other bacteria and the environmental lifestyle of this soil microorganism.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe transfer of information between DNA, RNA and proteins in a bacterium is often compared to the decoding of a piece of software in a computer. However, the tridimensional layout and the relational logic of the cognate biological hardware i.e. the nucleoid, the RNA polymerase and the ribosomes, are habitually taken for granted. In this work we inspected the localization and fate of the transcripts that stem from the archetypal biodegradative plasmid pWW0 of soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440 through the non-homogenous milieu of the bacterial cytoplasm. The results expose that-- similarly to computers also--the material components that enable the expression flow are well separated physically and they decipher the sequences through a distinct tridimensional arrangement with no indication of transcription/translation coupling. We argue that the resulting subcellular architecture enters an extra regulatory layer that obeys a species-specific positional code that accompanies the environmental lifestyle of this bacterium.",

    "abstract": "The plant phenylpropanoid pathway generates a major class of specialized metabolites and precursors of essential extracellular polymers that initially appeared upon plant terrestrialization. Despite its evolutionary significance, little is known about the complexity and function of this major metabolic pathway in extant bryophytes, which represent the non-vascular stage of embryophyte evolution. Here, we report that the HYDROXYCINNAMOYL-CoA:SHIKIMATE HYDROXYCINNAMOYL TRANSFERASE (HCT) gene that plays a critical function in the phenylpropanoid pathway during seed plant development, is functionally conserved in Physcomitrium patens (Physcomitrella), in the moss lineage of bryophytes. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that bonafide HCT function emerged in the progenitor of embryophytes. In vitro enzyme assays, moss phenolic pathway reconstitution in yeast and in planta gene inactivation coupled to targeted metabolic profiling, collectively indicate that P. patens HCT (PpHCT), similar to tracheophyte HCT orthologs, uses shikimate as a native acyl acceptor to produce a p-coumaroyl-5-O-shikimate intermediate. Phenotypic and metabolic analyses of loss-of-function mutants show that PpHCT is necessary for the production of caffeate derivatives, including previously reported caffeoyl-threonate esters, and for the formation of an intact cuticle. Deep conservation of HCT function in embryophytes is further suggested by the ability of HCT genes from P. patens and the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha to complement an Arabidopsis thaliana CRISPR/Cas9 hct mutant, and by the presence of phenolic esters of shikimate in representative species of the three bryophyte lineages.",

The Slow Loris Conservation Center was built at the Japan Monkey Center to enhance the welfare of confiscated slow lorises, promote their conservation, improve public education and perform scientific research on the species. In the course of improving housing conditions, several same-sex pairs of pygmy slow lorises were formed. We monitored their behaviors and fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) levels to understand whether male same-sex pairings could be a feasible management strategy. The subjects were 10 male and 6 female lorises for comparison, all of whom were over five years old. We successfully formed five pairs of male lorises after eight formation attempts. Male pairs initially showed some aggressive behaviors; however, the rate decreased approximately 10 days after introduction. All of the male pairs eventually exhibited extensive affiliative social behaviors, including allogrooming and social play, during the dark (active) phase, and sleep site sharing during the light (inactive) phase. The rate of sleep site sharing during the light phase was higher than expected, suggesting that the pairs preferred to stay near each other. There was no evidence of increased stress after a long period of male-male social housing. Female same-sex pairs and male-female pairs demonstrated a high level of affiliative behaviors right after introduction. These results highlight the flexibility and high sociability of this species and indicate that such same-sex pairings are a feasible option for their social management.",

    "abstract": "Copper is essential for all life forms; however in excess it is extremely toxic. Toxic properties of copper are utilized by hosts against various pathogenic invasions. Leishmania, in its both free-living and intracellular forms, was found to exhibit appreciable tolerance towards copper-stress. To determine the mechanism of copper-stress evasion employed by Leishmania we identified and characterized the hitherto unknown Copper-ATPase in Leishmania major and determined its role in parasites survival in host macrophage cells. L. major Cu-ATPase, LmATP7, exhibits high homology with its orthologues at multiple conserved motifs. In promastigotes, LmATP7 localized to the plasma membrane with a fraction in intracellular puncta. Upon copper treatment, LmATP7 expression increases few folds. LmATP7 is capable of complementing copper transport in Cu-ATPase-{Delta} yeast strain. Promastigotes overexpressing LmATP7 exhibits higher survival upon copper stress indicating efficacious copper export compared to wild type and heterozygous LmATP7 knock-out parasites. We explored macrophage-Leishmanial interaction with respect to copper stress subjected by the host upon parasite and the parasites reciprocating response thereon to evade the stress. The Copper-P-type-ATPases ATP7A/7B serve as major copper exporters in mammals that maintain cellular copper levels. We found that Leishmania infection triggers ATP7A upregulation in macrophages. Additionally, as part of host response, ATP7A traffics from trans-Golgi network and transports copper to the endosomal and endolysosomal compartments harbouring the Leishmania amastigotes. Finally, we show LmATP7 overexpression in this parasite increased amastigote survivability within infected macrophages whereas knocking it down reduces that drastically, establishing its role in combating host-induced copper stress.",

    "abstract": "Technologies that precisely delete genomic sequences in a programmed fashion can be used to study function as well as potentially for gene therapy. The leading contemporary method for programmed deletion uses CRISPR/Cas9 and pairs of guide RNAs (gRNAs) to generate two nearby double-strand breaks, which is often followed by deletion of the intervening sequence during DNA repair. However, this approach can be inefficient and imprecise, with errors including small indels at the two target sites as well as unintended large deletions and more complex rearrangements. Here we describe a prime editing-based method that we term PRIME-Del, which induces a deletion using a pair of prime editing gRNAs (pegRNAs) that target opposite DNA strands, effectively programming not only the sites that are nicked but also the outcome of the repair. We demonstrate that PRIME-Del achieves markedly higher precision in programming deletions than CRISPR/Cas9 and gRNA pairs. We also show that PRIME-Del can be used to couple genomic deletions with short insertions, enabling deletions whose junctions do not fall at protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sites. Finally, we demonstrate that lengthening the time window of expression of prime editing components can substantially enhance efficiency without compromising precision. We anticipate that PRIME-Del will be broadly useful in enabling precise, flexible programming of genomic deletions, including in-frame deletions, as well as for epitope tagging and potentially for programming rearrangements.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) protect against COVID-19. A concern regarding SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is whether they mediate disease enhancement. Here, we isolated NAbs against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike from individuals with acute or convalescent SARS-CoV-2 or a history of SARS-CoV-1 infection. Cryo-electron microscopy of RBD and NTD antibodies demonstrated function-specific modes of binding. Select RBD NAbs also demonstrated Fc receptor-{gamma} (Fc{gamma}R)-mediated enhancement of virus infection in vitro, while five non-neutralizing NTD antibodies mediated Fc{gamma}R-independent in vitro infection enhancement. However, both types of infection-enhancing antibodies protected from SARS-CoV-2 replication in monkeys and mice. Nonetheless, three of 31 monkeys infused with enhancing antibodies had higher lung inflammation scores compared to controls. One monkey had alveolar edema and elevated bronchoalveolar lavage inflammatory cytokines. Thus, while in vitro antibody-enhanced infection does not necessarily herald enhanced infection in vivo, increased lung inflammation can occur in SARS-CoV-2 antibody-infused macaques.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN / pneumococcus), invades myriad of host tissues following efficient breaching of cellular barriers. However, strategies adopted by pneumococcus for evasion of host intracellular defences governing successful transcytosis across host cellular barriers remain elusive. In this study, using brain endothelium as a model host barrier, we observed that pneumococcus containing endocytic vacuoles (PCVs) formed following SPN internalization into brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), undergo early maturation and acidification, with a major subset acquiring lysosome-like characteristics. Exploration of measures that would preserve pneumococcal viability in the lethal acidic pH of these lysosome-like vacuoles revealed a critical role of the two-component system response regulator, CiaR, which has been previously implicated in induction of acid tolerance response. Pyruvate oxidase (SpxB), a key sugar metabolizing enzyme that catalyses oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl phosphate, was found to contribute to acid stress tolerance, presumably via acetyl phosphate-mediated phosphorylation and activation of CiaR, independent of its cognate kinase CiaH. Hydrogen peroxide, the by-product of SpxB catalysed reaction, was also found to improve pneumococcal intracellular survival, by oxidative inactivation of lysosomal cysteine cathepsins, thus compromising the degradative capacity of the host lysosomes. Expectedly, a {Delta}spxB mutant was found to be significantly attenuated in its ability to survive inside the BMEC endocytic vacuoles, reflecting in its reduced transcytosis ability. Collectively, our studies establish SpxB as an important virulence determinant facilitating pneumococcal survival inside host cells, ensuring successful trafficking across host cellular barriers.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYEukaryotic cells which constitute host barriers have innate immune defences to restrict microbial passage into sterile compartments. This necessitates need for pathogens to devise strategies to evade these, for successful establishment of disease. In this study, by focussing on the blood-brain barrier endothelium, we investigate the mechanisms which enable the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae to traverse host barriers. Pyruvate oxidase, a pneumococcal sugar metabolizing enzyme was found to play a critical role in this key event, owing to production of acetyl phosphate and hydrogen peroxide via its enzymatic activity. On one hand, acetyl phosphate, by contributing to activation of acid tolerance stress response, enabled pneumococci to maintain viability in the lethal acidic pH of the lysosome-like vacuoles inside brain endothelium. On the other, hydrogen peroxide, was found to oxidise and inactivate a subset of degradative lysosomal enzymes. This two-pronged approach, aided by pyruvate oxidase, enabled pneumococci to evade intracellular degradation for successful transcytosis across the endothelium. Thus, pyruvate oxidase is a key determinant of pneumococcal virulence and hence can potentially serve as a viable candidate for therapeutic interventions for better management of invasive pneumococcal diseases.",

    "abstract": "Nanopore sequencing has emerged as a rapid and cost-efficient tool for diagnostic and epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study compared results from sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genome using R9 vs R10 flow cells and Rapid Barcoding Kit (RBK) vs Ligation Sequencing Kit (LSK). The R9 chemistry provided a lower error rate (3.5%) than R10 chemistry (7%). The SARS-CoV-2 genome includes few homopolymeric regions. Longest homopolymers were composed of 7 (TTTTTTT) and 6 (AAAAAA) nucleotides. The R10 chemistry resulted in a lower rate of deletions in timine and adenine homopolymeric regions than R9, at expenses of a larger rate (~10%) of mismatches in these regions.\n\nThe LSK had a larger yield than RBK, and provided longer reads than RBK. It also resulted in a larger percentage of aligned reads (99% vs 93%) and also in a complete consensus genome.\n\nThe results from this study suggest that the LSK used on a R9 flow cell could maximize the yield and accuracy of the consensus sequence when used in epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nKeypointsO_LISequencing SARS-CoV-2 genome is of great importance for the pandemic surveillance\nC_LIO_LINanopore offers a low cost and accurate method to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genome\nC_LIO_LILigation sequencing is preferred rather than the rapid kit using transposases\nC_LI",

Functional characterization and further validation of these interactions elucidated how distinct SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins participate in its lifecycle, and discovered potential drug targets to the treatment of COVID-19. The interactomes of two key SARS-CoV-2 encoded viral proteins, NSP1 and N protein, were compared with the interactomes of their counterparts in other human coronaviruses. These comparisons not only revealed common host pathways these viruses manipulate for their survival, but also showed divergent protein-protein interactions that may explain differences in disease pathology.

    "abstract": "BackgroundLINCS, \"Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures\", and IDG, \"Illuminating the Druggable Genome\", are both NIH projects and consortia that have generated rich datasets for the study of the molecular basis of human health and disease. LINCS L1000 expression signatures provide unbiased systems/omics experimental evidence. IDG provides compiled and curated knowledge for illumination and prioritization of novel drug target hypotheses. Together, these resources can support a powerful new approach to identifying novel drug targets for complex diseases, such as Parkinsons disease (PD), which continues to inflict severe harm on human health, and resist traditional research approaches.\n\nResultsIntegrating LINCS and IDG, we built the Knowledge Graph Analytics Platform (KGAP) to support an important use case: identification and prioritization of drug target hypotheses for associated diseases. The KGAP approach includes strong semantics interpretable by domain scientists and a robust, high performance implementation of a graph database and related analytical methods. Illustrating the value of our approach, we investigated results from queries relevant to PD. Approved PD drug indications from IDGs resource DrugCentral were used as starting points for evidence paths exploring chemogenomic space via LINCS expression signatures for associated genes, evaluated as target hypotheses by integration with IDG. The KG-analytic scoring function was validated against a gold standard dataset of genes associated with PD as elucidated, published mechanism-of-action drug targets, also from DrugCentral. IDGs resource TIN-X was used to rank and filter KGAP results for novel PD targets, and one, SYNGR3 (Synaptogyrin-3), was manually investigated further as a case study and plausible new drug target for PD.\n\nConclusionsThe synergy of LINCS and IDG, via KG methods, empowers graph analytics methods for the investigation of the molecular basis of complex diseases, and specifically for identification and prioritization of novel drug targets. The KGAP approach enables downstream applications via integration with resources similarly aligned with modern KG methodology. The generality of the approach indicates that KGAP is applicable to many disease areas, in addition to PD, the focus of this paper.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies of ASD have mostly supported the existence of heterogeneity and genomic variation in ASD which have hindered and restrained development of any effective and targetable treatment for a long time. As numerous studies have shown, both genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity is presented in ASD, however, heterogeneity in genetic level is not fully understood which is the key challenges for the further research. Even dozens of ASD susceptibility genes have been discovered which is commonly accounting for 10 to 20 percent of ASD cases, the internal complex combination of mutated genes that determine the epigenetic factors of ASD is still not comprehensively recognized by the recent studies. First by discouraging the traditional method that have been applied in most of the current research of diseases, this research will then focus on dissecting the heterogeneity of polygenic diseases and analyzing with an unconventional approach for acquiring Differently Expressed Genes (DEGs) in Guptas Dataset that provided transcriptome of frontal cortex of ASD patients. Divide categories by using unsupervised learning strategy, the results yielded by analyzing within clusters of ASD have supported the feasibility of the attempts to use heterogeneity to reveal its underlying mechanism. This study puts forward the inference that the heterogeneity of polygenic diseases will obscure the molecular signals related to the disease, and at the same time attempts to use heterogeneity to reveal the underlying mechanism.",

    "abstract": "1.Predicting the functional consequences of single point mutations has relevance to protein function annotation and to clinical analysis/diagnosis. We developed and tested Packpred that makes use of a multi-body clique statistical potential in combination with a depth dependent amino acid substitution matrix (FADHM) and positional Shannon Entropy to predict the functional consequences of point mutations in proteins. Parameters were trained over a saturation mutagenesis data set of T4-lysozyme (1966 mutations). The method was tested over another saturation mutagenesis data set (CcdB; 1534 mutations) and the Missense3D data set (4099 mutations). The performance of Packpred was compared against those of six other contemporary methods. With MCC values of 0.42, 0.47 and 0.36 on the training and testing data sets respectively, Packpred outperforms all method in all data sets, with the exception of marginally underperforming to FADHM in the CcdB data set. On analyzing the results, we could build meta servers that chose best performing methods of wild type amino acids and for wild type-mutant amino acid pairs. This lead to an increase of MCC value of 0.40 and 0.51 for the two meta predictors respectively on the Missense3D data set. We conjecture that it is possible to improve accuracy with better meta predictors as among the 7 methods compared, at the least one method or another is able to correctly predict [~]99% of the data.",

    "abstract": "Clamp loaders are AAA+ ATPases that load sliding clamps onto DNA. We mapped the mutational sensitivity of the T4 bacteriophage sliding clamp and clamp loader by deep mutagenesis, and found that residues not involved in catalysis or binding display remarkable tolerance to mutation. An exception is a glutamine residue in the AAA+ module (Gln 118) that is not located at a catalytic or interfacial site. Gln 118 forms a hydrogen-bonded junction in a helical unit that we term the central coupler, because it connects the catalytic centers to DNA and the sliding clamp. A suppressor mutation indicates that hydrogen bonding in the junction is important, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that it maintains rigidity in the central coupler. The glutamine-mediated junction is preserved in diverse AAA+ ATPases, suggesting that a connected network of hydrogen bonds that links ATP molecules is an essential aspect of allosteric communication in these proteins.",

    "abstract": "Presence of dysfunctional senescent hepatocyte is a hallmark feature of cirrhosis. We now report the presence of senescent hepatocytes (p21 and p53 positive) in vicinity of infiltrated immune cells in hepatocellular carcinoma. Hence, we checked if senescent cells can alter fate of macrophage polarization and neutrophil extracellular trap (NETs) formation. Using an in vitro assay, senescence was induced in hepatoma cells (HepG2 and Huh7 cells) by doxorubicin treatment and senescent cell showed secretory phenotype with strong expression of cytokines (IL1{beta}, IL6, IL8 and IL13) as evaluated by Flow cytometry. The senescent secretome from hepatoma cells induced macrophage differentiation predominantly with M2 markers (CD80, CD86) while that of non-senescent cell induced M1 phenotype (CD163, CD206) as analysed by flow cytometry. Human hepatocellular carcinoma harbouring senescent hepatocytes showed presence of M2 macrophages, while M1 macrophages were predominant in non-tumorous region. Additionally, the senescent secretome from Huh7 cells (p53mut) enhanced the NETs formation, while HepG2 (p53+/+) secretome had an inhibitory affect In conclusion, the \"pro-inflammatory\" senescent secretome drives non-inflammatory type M2 macrophage polarization and modulate neutrophil traps thereby modulating the microenvironment towards tumor promotion. Targeting senescent hepatocyte secretome appears a promising therapeutic target in liver cancer in future.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=126 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/423905v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1df4256org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7c4f53org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13bfe80org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c1c4b5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Work Highlight (Diagrammatic Representation).\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "The stilbenoid pathway is responsible for the production of resveratrol and its derivatives in grapevine. A few transcription factors (TFs) have been previously identified as regulators of this pathway but the extent of this control is yet to be fully understood. Here we demonstrate how DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-Seq) allows for genome-wide TF binding site interrogation in a non-model species. We obtained 5,190 and 4,443 binding events assigned to 4,041 and 3,626 genes for MYB14 and MYB15, respectively (around 40% of peaks being located within -10kb of transcription start sites). DAP-Seq of MYB14 and MYB15 was combined with aggregate gene centred co-expression networks built from more than 1,400 transcriptomic datasets from leaves, fruits and flowers to narrow down bound genes to a set of high confidence targets. The analysis of MYB14, MYB15 and MYB13, a third uncharacterised member of Subgroup 2 (S2), showed that in addition to the few previously known stilbene synthase (STS ) targets, these three regulators bind to 30 out of 47 STS family genes. Moreover all three MYBs bind to several PAL, C4H and 4CL genes, in addition to shikimate pathway genes, the WRKY03 stilbenoid co-regulator and novel resveratrol-modifying gene candidates amongst which ROMT2 -3 were validated enzymatically. A high proportion of DAP-Seq bound genes was induced in the activated transcriptomes of transient MYB15 -overexpressing stilbenoid-producing grapevine leaves, validating our methodological approach for identifying gene regulatory networks of specialised metabolism. Overall, MYB genes from Subgroup 2 appear to play a key role in binding and directly regulating several primary and secondary metabolic steps leading to an increased flux towards stilbenoid production.",

    "abstract": "The multi-trait genotype-ideotype distance index (MGIDI) was used to select superior treatments in experiments with strawberries. Twenty-three productive, qualitative, physiological, and phenological traits with negative and positive desired gains were accessed in 16 treatments, a combination of two cultivars (Albion-neutral days, and Camarosa-short days), two transplants origins (National and Imported), and four organic substrates mixes (Crushed sugarcane bagasse, burnt rice husk, organic substrate, and Carolina commercial substrate). Our results suggest that most of the strawberry traits are influenced by the cultivar, transplant origin, cultivation substrates, as well as by the interaction between cultivar and transplant origin. The MGIDI index indicated that the Albion cultivar originated from imported transplants grown in substrates where the main component (70%) is burnt rice husk provides desired values for 20 of a total of 22 traits, which represents a success rate of ~ 91% in selecting traits with desired values. The strengths and weakness view provided by the MGIDI index revealed that the looking for an ideal treatment should direct the efforts on improving the water efficiency use and reducing total acidy of fruits. On the other hand, the strengths of selected treatments are mainly related to productive precocity, total soluble solids, and flesh firmness. The MGIDI index provides a unique, robust, and easy-to-handle process, standing out as a powerful tool to develop better treatment recommendations for experiments with strawberries when multiple traits are assessed.",

    "abstract": "Self-sustaining neural activity maintained through local recurrent connections is of fundamental importance to cortical function. We show that Up-states--an example of self-sustained, inhibition-stabilized network dynamics--emerge in cortical circuits across three weeks of ex vivo development, establishing the presence of unsupervised learning rules capable of generating self-sustained dynamics. Previous computational models have established that four sets of weights (WE[&lt;-]E, WE[&lt;-]I, WI[&lt;-]E, WI[&lt;-]I) must interact in an orchestrated manner to produce Up-states, but have not addressed how a family of learning rules can operate in parallel at all four weight classes to generate self-sustained inhibition-stabilized dynamics. Using numerical and analytical methods we show that, in part due to the paradoxical effect, standard homeostatic rules are only stable in a narrow parameter regime. In contrast, we show that a family of biologically plausible learning rules based on \"cross-homeostatic\" plasticity robustly lead to the emergence of self-sustained, inhibition-stabilized dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Electrophysiological recording in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mammals have revealed a number of complex interactions between the center and surround. Understanding the underlying circuit mechanisms is crucial to understanding fundamental brain computations. In this paper we address the following phenomena that have been observed in V1 of animals with orientation maps: 1) surround suppression that is accompanied by a decrease in the excitatory and inhibitory currents that the cell receives as the stimulus size increases beyond the cells summation field; 2) surround tuning to the center orientation, in which the strongest suppression arises when the surround orientation matches that of the center stimulus; and 3) feature-specific suppression, in which a surround stimulus of a given orientation specifically suppresses that orientations component of the response to a center plaid stimulus. We show that a stabilized supralinear network that has biologically plausible connectivity and synaptic efficacies that depend on cortical distance and orientation difference between neurons can consistently reproduce all the above phenomena. We explain the mechanism behind each result, and argue that feature-specific suppression and surround tuning to the center orientation are independent phenomena. Specifically, if we remove some aspects of the connectivity from the model it will still produce feature-specific suppression but not surround tuning to the center orientation. We also show that in the model the activity decay time constant is similar to the cortical activity decay time constant reported in mouse V1. Our model indicates that if the surround activates neurons that fall within the reach of the horizontal projections in V1, the above mentioned phenomena can be generated by V1 alone without the need of cortico-cortical feedback. Finally, we show that these results hold both in networks with rate-based units and with conductance-based spiking units. This demonstrates that the stabilized supra-linear network mechanism can be achieved in the more biological context of spiking networks.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal place cells form a map of an animals environment. When the animal moves to a new environment, place field locations and firing rates change, a phenomenon known as remapping. Different animals can have different remapping responses to the same environments. This variability across animals in remapping behavior is not well understood. In this work, we analyzed electrophysiological recordings from Alme et al. (2014), in which five male rats were exposed to 11 different environments. To compare the hippocampal maps in two rooms, we computed average rate map correlation coefficients. We discovered that the heterogeneity in animals remapping behavior is structured: animals remapping behavior is consistent across a range of independent comparisons. Our findings highlight that remapping behavior between repeated environments depends on animal-specific factors.",

    "abstract": "The ability to generalize rapidly across specific experiences is vital for robust recognition of new patterns, especially in speech perception considering acoustic-phonetic pattern variability. Behavioral research has demonstrated that listeners are rapidly able to generalize their experience with a talkers speech and quickly improve understanding of a difficult-to-understand talker without prolonged practice, e.g., even after a single training session. Here, we examine the differences in neural responses to generalized versus rote learning in auditory cortical processing by training listeners to understand a novel synthetic talker using a Pretest-Posttest design with electroencephalography (EEG). Participants were trained using either (1) a large inventory of words where no words repeated across the experiment (generalized learning) or (2) a small inventory of words where words repeated (rote learning). Analysis of long-latency auditory evoked potentials at Pretest and Posttest revealed that while rote and generalized learning both produce rapid changes in auditory processing, the nature of these changes differed. In the context of adapting to a talker, generalized learning is marked by an amplitude reduction in the N1-P2 complex and by the presence of a late-negative (LN) wave in the auditory evoked potential following training. Rote learning, however, is marked only by temporally later source configuration changes. The early N1-P2 change, found only for generalized learning, suggests that generalized learning relies on the attentional system to reorganize the way acoustic features are selectively processed. This change in relatively early sensory processing (i.e. during the first 250ms) is consistent with an active processing account of speech perception, which proposes that the ability to rapidly adjust to the specific vocal characteristics of a new talker (for which rote learning is rare) relies on attentional mechanisms to adaptively tune early auditory processing sensitivity.\n\nStatement of SignificancePrevious research on perceptual learning has typically examined neural responses during rote learning: training and testing is carried out with the same stimuli. As a result, it is not clear that findings from these studies can explain learning that generalizes to novel patterns, which is critical in speech perception. Are neural responses to generalized learning in auditory processing different from neural responses to rote learning? Results indicate rote learning of a particular talkers speech involves brain regions focused on the memory encoding and retrieving of specific learned patterns, whereas generalized learning involves brain regions involved in reorganizing attention during early sensory processing. In learning speech from a novel talker, only generalized learning is marked by changes in the N1-P2 complex (reflective of secondary auditory cortical processing). The results are consistent with the view that robust speech perception relies on the fast adjustment of attention mechanisms to adaptively tune auditory sensitivity to cope with acoustic variability.",

Independent Component Analysis utilizes the statistical interdependence of pixel activation to completely unmix signals from background noise, given sufficient spatial and temporal samples. We also utilize isolated signal components to produce segmentations of the cortical surface, unique to each individuals functional patterning.

    "abstract": "Mechanisms regulating cell movement are not fully understood. One feature of cell movement that determines how far cells displace from an initial position is persistence, the ability to perform movements in a direction similar to the previous movement direction. Persistence is thus determined by turning angles between two sequential displacements and be characterized by an average turning angle or persistence time. Recent studies found that a cells average speed and turning are negatively correlated, suggesting a fundamental cell-intrinsic program whereby cells with a lower turning ability (i.e., larger persistence time) are intrinsically faster (or faster cells turn less). By simulating correlated or persistent random walks (PRWs) using two different frameworks (one based on von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and another based on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process) we show that the negative correlation between speed and turning naturally arises when cell trajectories are sub-sampled, i.e., when the frequency of sampling is lower than frequency at which cells make movements. This effect is strongest when the sampling frequency is on the order of magnitude with the typical cell persistence time and when cells vary in persistence time. Both conditions are observed for datasets of T cell movements in vivo that we have analyzed. In simulations the correlation arises due to randomness of cell movements resulting in highly variable persistence times for individual cells that with sub-sampling leads to large variability of average cell speeds. Interestingly, previously suggested methodology of calculating displacement of cell cohorts with different speeds resulted in similar results whether or not there is a cell-intrinsic correlation between cell speed and persistence. For both vMF- and OU-based simulations of PRWs we could find parameter values (distribution of persistence times, speeds, and sampling frequency) that matched experimentally measured correlations between speed and turning for two datasets of T cell movement in vivo suggesting that such simple correlations are not fully informative on the intrinsic link between speed and persistence. Our results thus suggest that sub-sampling may contribute to (and perhaps fully explains) the observed correlation between speed and turning at least for some cell trajectory data and emphasize the role of sampling frequency in inference of critical cellular parameters of cell motility such as speeds.\n\nSecondary AbstractMeasurement of cell movements often results in a negative correlation between average speed and average turning angle suggesting an existence of a universal, cell-intrinsic movement program. We show that such a negative correlation may arise if cells in the population differ in their ability for persistent movement when the movement data are sub-sampled. We show that sub-sampling of cell trajectories generated using two different frameworks of persistent random walk can match the experimentally observed correlation between speed and turning for T cell movements in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can infect a variety of cell types by using virions of varying glycoprotein compositions. It is still unclear how this diversity is generated, but spatio-temporally separated envelopment and egress pathways might play a role. So far, one egress pathway has been described in which HCMV particles are individually enveloped into small vesicles and are subsequently exocytosed continuously. However, some studies have also found enveloped virus particles inside multivesicular structures but could not link them to productive egress or degradation pathways.\n\nWe used a novel 3D-CLEM workflow allowing us to investigate these structures in HCMV morphogenesis and egress at high spatio-temporal resolution. We found that multiple envelopment events occurred at individual vesicles leading to multiviral bodies (MViBs), which subsequently traversed the cytoplasm to release virions as intermittent bulk pulses at the plasma membrane to form extracellular virus accumulations (EVAs). Our data support the existence of a novel bona fide HCMV egress pathway, which opens the gate to evaluate divergent egress pathways in generating virion diversity.",

    "abstract": "Functional characterization of H- and D-MATE (Multidrug and Toxin Extrusion) transporters from clinical isolates of Vibrio fluvialis revealed H-type conferred resistance to fluoroquinolones, ethidium bromide and safranin whereas D-type exhibited marginal resistance towards ethidium bromide only. Both H-/D-type transporters were inhibited by reserpine resulting in increased intracellular norfloxacin concentration. The efflux was facilitated by both Na+/K+ ions, suggesting that these efflux pumps were ion-dependent. In presence of various classes of EPIs, there was decrease in MIC exhibited by H-/D-type efflux pumps towards norfloxacin which didnt translate into transport inhibition. But reserpine presented a conclusive pattern with decrease in MIC towards norfloxacin and increased norfloxacin accumulation inferring maximum inhibition. Substrate binding and electrostatic charge distribution of both the transporters was similar to other known MATE transporters. The H-type exhibited 10 transmembranes and D-type exhibited 11 TMs which was different from other MATE transporters known to have 12 TMs (Transmembranes). Data derived from molecular docking and ion binding studies revealed that Aspartic Acid residue in 1st TM acts as ion binding site with transport mechanism similar to NorM. Electrostatic potential map of both the transporters revealed that there is a cavity formation within the transporters surrounded by charged electronegative amino acid residues. Interestingly, surface models of both transporters revealed that 1st TM forms covalent bond with 7th TM towards extracellular space. Docking studies also revealed that reserpine covalently binds to central pocket of both transporters and serves as excellent EPI against these transporters as evidenced by MIC and drug accumulation assays.",

    "abstract": "YhcB, an uncharacterized protein conserved across gamma-proteobacteria, is composed predominantly of a single Domain of Unknown Function (DUF 1043) with an N-terminal transmembrane -helix. Here, we show that E. coli YhcB is a conditionally essential protein that interacts with the proteins of the cell divisome (e.g., FtsI, FtsQ) and elongasome (e.g., RodZ, RodA). We found 7 interactions of YhcB that are conserved in Yersinia pestis and/or Vibrio cholerae. Furthermore, we identified several point mutations that abolished interactions of YhcB with FtsI and RodZ. The yhcB knock-out strain does not grow at 45{degrees}C and is hypersensitive to cell-wall acting antibiotics even in stationary phase. The deletion of yhcB leads to filamentation, abnormal FtsZ ring formation, and aberrant septa development. The 2.8 [A] crystal structure for the cytosolic domain from Haemophilus ducreyi YhcB shows a unique tetrameric -helical coiled-coil structure that combines parallel and anti-parallel coiled-coil intersubunit interactions. This structure is likely to organize interprotein oligomeric interactions on the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane, possibly involved in regulation of cell division and/or envelope biogenesis/integrity in proteobacteria. In summary, YhcB is a conserved and conditionally essential protein that is predicted to play a role in cell division and consequently or in addition affects envelope biogenesis.\n\nImportanceOnly 0.8 % of the protein annotations in the UniProt are based on experimental evidence and thus, functional characterization of unknown proteins remains a rate-limiting step in molecular biology. Herein, the functional properties of YhcB (DUF1043) were investigated using an integrated approach combining X-ray crystallography with genetics and molecular biology. YhcB is a conserved protein that appears to be needed for the transition from exponential to stationary growth and is involved in cell division and/or envelope biogenesis/integrity. This study will serve as a starting point for future studies on this protein family and on how cells transit from exponential to stationary survival.",

We have previously shown that human coronavirus 229E survives for more than 5 days on inanimate surfaces and another laboratory reproduced this for SARS-CoV-2 this year.

Using 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing, the spatiotemporal distributions of major SAR11 subclades and individual amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were evaluated. On average, 77% of the SAR11 community was compromised of a small number of ASVs (7 of 106 in total), which were ubiquitously distributed across all samples collected from one or both of the end-member environments sampled in this study (coastal or offshore). SAR11 ASVs were more often restricted spatially to coastal or offshore environments (64 of 106 ASVs) than they were shared among coastal, transition, and offshore environments (39 of 106 ASVs). Overall, offshore SAR11 communities contained a higher diversity of SAR11 ASVs than their nearshore counterparts.

The ST131 was more prevalent in human samples, and worryingly the high-risk ST131-C1-M27 was identified in human infections for the first time. We also detected CTX-M-55-producing E. coli ST117 isolates from meat samples (i.e., chicken and pork) and human infections. Moreover, we have identified the important clone CTX-M-24-positive E. coli ST354 from human samples in Brazil for the first time. In brief, our results suggest a potential of commercialized meat as a reservoir of high-priority E. coli lineages in the community. In contrast, the identification of E. coli ST131-C1-M27 indicates that novel pandemic clones have emerged in Brazil, constituting a public health issue.",

    "abstract": "RationaleSARS-CoV-2 infection of the respiratory system can progress to a life threatening multi-systemic disease, mediated via an excess of cytokines (\"cytokine storm\"), but the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood.\n\nObjectivesTo investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 may induce cellular senescence in lung epithelial cells, leading to secretion of inflammatory cytokines, known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).\n\nMethodsAutopsy lung tissue samples from eleven COVID-19 patients and sixty age-matched non-infected controls were analysed by immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 and markers of cellular senescence (SenTraGor, p16INK4A) and key SASP cytokines (interleukin-1{beta}, interleukin-6). We also investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 infection of an epithelial cell line induces senescence and cytokine secretion.\n\nMeasurements and Main ResultsSARS-CoV-2 was detected by immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy predominantly in alveolar type-2 (AT2) cells, which also expressed the angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2), a critical entry receptor for this virus. In COVID-19 samples, AT2 cells displayed increased markers of senescence [p16INK4A, SenTraGor staining positivity in 12{+/-}1.2% of cells compared to 1.7{+/-}0.13% in non-infected controls (p<0.001)], with markedly increased expression of interleukin-1{beta} and interleukin-6 (p<0.001). Infection of epithelial cells (Vero E6) with SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro induced senescence and DNA damage (increased SenTraGor and {gamma}-H2AX), and reduced proliferation (Ki67) compared to uninfected control cells (p<0.01).\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate that in severe COVID-19 patients, AT2 cells are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and show senescence and expression of proinflammatory cytokines. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells may induce senescence and inflammation, indicating that cellular senescence may be an important molecular mechanism of severe COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Choosing the optimum assembly approach is essential to achieving a high-quality genome assembly suitable for comparative and evolutionary genomic investigations. Significant recent progress in long-read sequencing technologies such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) also brought about a large variety of assemblers. Although these have been extensively tested on model species such as Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster, such benchmarking has not been done in Mollusca which lacks widely adopted model species. Molluscan genomes are notoriously rich in repeats and are often highly heterozygous, making their assembly challenging. Here, we benchmarked 10 assemblers based on ONT raw reads from two published molluscan genomes of differing properties, the gastropod Chrysomallon squamiferum (356.6Mb, 1.59% heterozygosity) and the bivalve Mytilus coruscus (1593Mb, 1.94% heterozygosity). By optimising the assembly pipeline, we greatly improved both genomes from previously published versions. Our results suggested that 40-50X of ONT reads are sufficient for high-quality genomes, with Flye being the recommended assembler for compact and less heterozygous genomes exemplified by C. squamiferum, while NextDenovo excelled for more repetitive and heterozygous molluscan genomes exemplified by M. coruscus. A phylogenomic analysis utilising the two updated genomes with other 32 published high-quality lophotrochozoan genomes resulted in maximum support across all nodes, and we show that improved genome quality also leads to more complete matrices for phylogenomic inferences. Our benchmarking will ensure the efficiency in future assemblies for molluscs and perhaps also other marine phyla with few genomes available.",

Such heterogeneity has been characterized in liver cancer at single-cell sub-chromosomal scale, and a more precise single-variant resolution analysis is lacking. Here we employed a strategy to analyze both the single-cell genomic mutations and transcriptomic changes in 5 patients with liver cancer. Target sequencing was done for a total of 480 single cells in a patient-specific manner. DNA copy number status of point mutations was obtained from single-cell mutational profiling. The clonal structures of liver cancers were then uncovered at single-variant resolution, and mutation combinations in single cells enabled reconstruction of their evolutionary history. A common origin but independent evolutionary fate was revealed for primary liver tumor and intrahepatic metastatic portal vein tumor thrombus. The mutational signature suggested early evolutionary process may be related to specific etiology like aristolochic acids. By parallel single-cell RNA-Seq, the transcriptomic phenotype was found to be related with genetic heterogeneity in liver cancer. We reconstructed the single-cell and single-variant resolution clonal evolutionary history of liver cancer, and dissection of both genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity provides knowledge for mechanistic understanding of liver cancer initiation and progression.",

Here we investigate translation of quadruplet codons by a +1-frameshifting tRNA, SufB2, that contains an extra nucleotide in its anticodon loop. Natural post-transcriptional modification of SufB2 in cells prevents it from frameshifting using a quadruplet-pairing mechanism such that it preferentially employs a triplet-slippage mechanism. We show that SufB2 uses triplet anticodon-codon pairing in the 0-frame to initially decode the quadruplet codon, but subsequently shifts to the +1-frame during tRNA-mRNA translocation. SufB2 frameshifting involves perturbation of an essential ribosome conformational change that facilitates tRNA-mRNA movements at a late stage of the translocation reaction. Our results provide a molecular mechanism for SufB2-induced +1 frameshifting and suggest that engineering of a specific ribosome conformational change can improve the efficiency of genome recoding.",

    "abstract": "Copper is essential for the activity and stability of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Loss-of-function mutations in genes required for copper transport to CcO result in fatal human disorders. Despite the fundamental importance of copper in mitochondrial and organismal physiology, systematic characterization of genes that regulate mitochondrial copper homeostasis is lacking. To identify genes required for mitochondrial copper homeostasis, we performed a genome-wide copper-sensitized screen using DNA barcoded yeast deletion library. Our screen recovered a number of genes known to be involved in cellular copper homeostasis while revealing genes previously not linked to mitochondrial copper biology. These newly identified genes include the subunits of the adaptor protein 3 complex (AP-3) and components of the cellular pH-sensing pathway-Rim20 and Rim21, both of which are known to affect vacuolar function. We find that AP-3 and the Rim mutants impact mitochondrial CcO function by maintaining vacuolar acidity. CcO activity of these mutants could be rescued by either restoring vacuolar pH or by supplementing growth media with additional copper. Consistent with these genetic data, pharmacological inhibition of the vacuolar proton pump leads to decreased mitochondrial copper content and a concomitant decrease in CcO abundance and activity. Taken together, our study uncovered a number of novel genetic regulators of mitochondrial copper homeostasis and provided a mechanism by which vacuolar pH impacts mitochondrial respiration through copper homeostasis.",

Importantly, biological neural networks cannot reliably detect and correct myocardial ischemia on their own. In this study, we demonstrate an artificially intelligent and responsive bioelectronic medicine, where an artificial neural network (ANN) supplements biological neural networks enabling reliable detection and correction of myocardial ischemia. ANNs were first trained to decode spontaneous cardiovascular stress and myocardial ischemia with an overall accuracy of [~]92%. ANN-controlled vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) reversed the major biomarkers of myocardial ischemia with no side effects. In contrast, open-loop VNS or ANN-controlled VNS following a caudal vagotomy essentially failed to reverse correlates of myocardial ischemia. Lastly, variants of ANNs were used to meet clinically relevant needs, including interpretable visualizations and unsupervised detection of emerging cardiovascular stress states. Overall, these results demonstrate that ANNs can supplement deficient biological neural networks via an artificially intelligent bioelectronic medicine system.",

We proposed the tunnel as the conductance channel closed by three constrictions: C1 in the extracellular half, mid-membrane C2 containing the photoactive site, and C3 on the cytoplasmic side. Reported here, the crystal structure of bromide-bound GtACR1 reveals structural changes that relax the C1 and C3 constrictions, including a novel salt-bridge switch mechanism involving C1 and the photoactive site. These findings indicate that substrate binding induces a transition from an inactivated state to a pre-activated state in the dark that facilitates channel opening by reducing free energy in the tunnel constrictions. The results provide direct evidence that the tunnel is the closed form of the channel of GtACR1 and shed light on the light-gated channel activation mechanism.\n\nImpact StatementSubstrate-induced structural changes in GtACR1 provide new insight into the chemical mechanism of natural light-gated anion conductance, and facilitate its optimization for photoinhibition of neuron firing in optogenetics.",

Vaccination is helpful, but the benefits are diminished with antigenic diversity within serotypes, instability of the immunogen and inability to confer protection for long durations. Here we have further dissected the mechanisms underpinning the protective efficacy of two previously reported neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), M8 and M170. The atomic details of the epitopes of M8 and M170 unveiled suggest that protection is conferred by disrupting the virus-receptor interactions. Consequently, administration of these NAbs conferred prophylactic and therapeutic benefit in guinea pigs, raising the possibility of administering NAbs before or during vaccination to confer immediate protection; well before the bolstering of the immune response by the vaccine. Differences in the residues and the conformation of elements making up the epitopes explain the differences in specificities of M8 and M170. An ability to bind 146S viral particles specifically, but not 12S degraded components, highlights a likely role for M170 in the quality control of vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Plants have evolved various mechanisms to defend themselves against pathogens. Many pathogens induce the formation of water-soaked lesions during early infection under conditions of high atmospheric humidity. These water-soaked spots are caused by the disruption of the plasma membrane or cell wall integrity due to various activities of effector proteins during infection. We hypothesized that bacterial PAMP-flagellin plays a role in modulating the cell-membrane permeability that controls the availability of water in the apoplast, to prevent bacterial establishment on the cell wall during the early stages of the PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) response. Our results revealed that the conductivity of hydraulic pathways in the leaf was reduced in response to flagellin22 (flg22). The cellular osmotic water permeability (Pf) of both mesophyll cells and bundlesheath cells was dramatically reduced in response to flg22 treatment. Moreover, the whole-leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) was also reduced in response to flg22 treatment. The fact that the Pf of mesophyll cells of an aquaporin (AQP) mutant was not affected by the flg22 treatment suggests the involvement of AQP channels in the flg22-induced Pf reduction signal transduction pathway. We conclude that the binding of flagellin to their receptors elicits signals to close AQPs, consequently reducing the water content of the cell wall and intercellular spaces and leading to a more negative water potential. This serves as an early PTI response to pathogen attack, which, in turn, might decrease the rate of bacterial growth and establishment in the apoplast.\n\nSignificance statementWe report that the membrane osmotic water permeability of both leaf mesophyll and vascular bundle-sheath cells is reduced in response to treatment with flagellin22. We suggest that this mechanism for cell dehydration may serve as an apoplastic defense response, to limit the chances of bacterial pathogens becoming established on the walls of leaf mesophyll cells.",

    "abstract": "Arsenic stress causes rapid transcriptional responses in plants. However, transcriptional regulators of arsenic-induced gene expression in plants remain less well known. To date, forward genetic screens have proven limited for dissecting arsenic response mechanisms. We hypothesized that this may be due to the extensive genetic redundancy present in plant genomes. To overcome this limitation, we pursued a forward genetics screen for arsenite tolerance using a randomized library of plants expressing >2,000 artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs). This library was designed to knock-down diverse combinations of homologous gene family members within sub-clades of transcription factor and transporter gene families. We identified six transformant lines showing an altered response to arsenite in root growth assays. Further characterization of an amiRNA line targeting closely homologous CBF and ERF transcription factors show that the CBF1,2 and 3 transcription factors negatively regulate arsenite sensitivity. Furthermore, the ERF34 and ERF35 transcription factors are required for cadmium resistance. Generation of CRISPR lines, higher-order T-DNA mutants, and gene expression analyses, further support our findings. These ERF transcription factors differentially regulate arsenite sensitivity and cadmium tolerance.",

    "abstract": "How variable is the functionally-defined structure of early visual areas in human cortex and how much variability is shared between twins? Here we quantify individual differences in the best understood functionally-defined regions of cortex: V1, V2, V3. The Human Connectome Project 7T Retinotopy Dataset includes retinotopic measurements from 181 subjects, including many twins. We trained four \"anatomists\" to manually define V1-V3 using retinotopic features. These definitions were more accurate than automated anatomical templates and showed that surface areas for these maps varied more than three-fold across individuals. This three-fold variation was little changed when normalizing visual area size by the surface area of the entire cerebral cortex. In addition to varying in size, we find that visual areas vary in how they sample the visual field. Specifically, the cortical magnification function differed substantially among individuals, with the relative amount of cortex devoted to central vision varying by more than a factor of 2. To complement the variability analysis, we examined the similarity of visual area size and structure across twins. Whereas the twin sample sizes are too small to make precise heritability estimates (50 monozygotic pairs, 34 dizygotic pairs), they nonetheless reveal high correlations, consistent with strong effects of the combination of shared genes and environment on visual area size. Collectively, these results provide the most comprehensive account of individual variability in visual area structure to date, and provide a robust population benchmark against which new individuals and developmental and clinical populations can be compared.\n\nSignificance StatementAreas V1, V2, and V3 are among the best studied functionally-defined regions in human cortex. Using the largest retinotopy dataset to date, we characterized the variability of these regions across individuals and the similarity between twin pairs. We find that the size of visual areas varies dramatically (up to 3.5x) across healthy young adults, far more than the variability of the cerebral cortex size as a whole. Much of this variability appears to arise from inherited factors, as we find very high correlations in visual area size between monozygotic twin-pairs, and lower but still substantial correlations between dizygotic twin pairs.

    "abstract": "Rising levels of antibiotic resistance dictate that new antibiotics with novel modes of action must be found. Here, we investigated the mode of action of a novel antibiotic that is a member of a family of synthetic DNA minor groove binding (MGB) molecules. MGB-BP-3 has successfully completed a Phase II clinical trial in humans as an orally administered drug for the treatment of chronic Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile infections, where it outperformed the existing benchmark (vancomycin). MGB-BP-3 is active against a variety of Gram-positive pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, which was used as the model for this study. The transcriptomic response of S. aureus to MGB-BP-3 identified downregulated promoters. DNase I and permanganate footprinting demonstrated binding to essential SigA promoters and the inhibition of promoter isomerisation by RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Promoters controlling DNA replication and peptidoglycan biosynthesis are amongst those affected by MGB-BP-3. Thus, MGB-BP-3 binds to and inhibits multiple essential promoters on the S. aureus chromosome, suggesting that evolution of resistance by drug target mutation should be unlikely. In confirmation, laboratory-directed evolution against sub-inhibitory concentrations of MGB-BP-3 resulted in no resistance whereas resistance to the single target RNA-polymerase inhibitor rifampicin arose rapidly.",

    "abstract": "The Whooping Crane (Grus americana) is one of North Americas most endangered species. There is only one wild, self-sustaining migratory population of Whooping Cranes, the Aransas-Wood Buffalo population (AWBP). The birds of the AWBP migrate 4,000 km twice each year between their nesting grounds in northern Canada and their wintering grounds on the Texas Gulf Coast. During migration, AWBP Whooping Cranes must land at suitable ponds or wetlands to forage, rest or roost. The Whooping Crane Recovery Plan, developed by federal wildlife agencies in Canada and the USA, calls for the protection and management of Whooping Crane stopover locations within the migration corridor. Although major stopover areas have been protected, many other smaller sites remain to be identified. However, the Recovery Plan offers no specific entity to identify, protect and manage the latter. To address these deficiencies in information and activity, Friends of the Wild Whoopers partnered with the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) within the AWBP migration corridor to share information about Whooping Cranes and their habitat needs and identify potential stopover locations on USACE properties that could be protected and managed for cranes. This partnership identified 624 potential stopover sites on 34 USACE lakes, principally in North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, with commitments to manage the habitats as resources allow.",

    "abstract": "Evidence of homology between proteins in the ATP synthetase and the bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) has been accumulating since the 1980s. Specifically, the BFMs Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) export apparatus FliH, FliI, and FliJ are considered homologous to FO-b + F1-{delta}, F1-/{beta}, and F1-{gamma}, and have similar structure and interactions. We review the discoveries that advanced the homology hypothesis and then conduct a further test by examining gene order in the two systems and their relatives. Conservation of gene order, or synteny, is often observed between closely related prokaryote species, but usually degrades with phylogenetic distance. As a result, observed conservation of synteny over vast phylogenetic distances can be evidence of shared ancestral coexpression, interaction, and function. We constructed a gene order dataset by examining the order of fliH, fliI, and fliJ genes across the phylogenetic breadth of flagellar and nonflagellar T3SS. We compared this to published surveys of gene order in the F1FO-ATP synthetase, its N-ATPase relatives, and the bacterial/archaeal V- and A-type ATPases. Strikingly, the fliHIJ gene order was deeply conserved, with the few exceptions appearing derived, and exactly matching the widely conserved F-ATPase gene order atpFHAG, coding for subunits b-{delta}--{gamma}. The V/A-type ATPases have a similar conserved gene order shared for homologous components. Our results further strengthen the argument for homology between these systems, and suggest a rare case of synteny conserved over billions of years, dating back to well before the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA).",

    "abstract": "Codon usage bias is a ubiquitous phenomenon occurring at both, interspecies and intraspecies level in different organisms. P. knowlesi, whose natural host is long-tailed Macaque monkeys, has recently started infecting humans as well. The genome as well as coding sequence data of P. knowlesi is used to understand their codon usage pattern in the light of other human infecting Plasmodium species: P. vivax and P. falciparum. The different codon usage indicators: GC content, relative synonymous codon usage, effective number of codon and codon adaptation index are studied to analyze codon usage in the Plasmodium species. The codon usage pattern is found to be less conserved in studied Plasmodium species, and changes species to species at the genus level. The codon usage pattern of P. knowlesi shows similarity to P. vivax as compared to P. falciparum. The ENC vs. GC3 study indicates that compositional constraints and translation selection is the decisive forces responsible for shaping their codon usage. The studies Plasmodium species shows a higher usage of A/T ending optimal codons. This favors the codon bias in P. knowlesi and P. vivax is due to high selection pressure and in P. falciparum, the compositional mutational pressure is a dominant force. In a nutshell, our finding suggests that the more or less similar codon usage pattern of P. knowlesi and P. vivax may suggest the similar host invasion and immune evasion strategies for disease establishment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDDNA methylation dynamics in the brain are associated with normal development and neuropsychiatric disease and differ across functionally distinct brain regions. Previous studies of genome-wide methylation differences among human brain regions focused on limited numbers of individuals and one to two brain regions.\n\nRESULTSUsing GTEx samples, we have generated a resource of DNA methylation in purified neuronal nuclei from 8 brain regions as well as lung and thyroid tissues from 12-23 donors. We identified differentially methylated regions between brain regions (DMRs) among neuronal nuclei in both CpG (181,146) and non-CpG (264,868) contexts, few of which were unique to a single pair-wise comparison. This significantly expands the knowledge of differential methylation across the brain by 10-fold. In addition, we present the first differential methylation analysis among neuronal nuclei from basal ganglia tissues and identified 2,295 unique CpG DMRs, many associated with ion transport. Consistent with prior studies, CpG DMRs were enriched in regulatory regions while non-CpG DMRs were enriched in intergenic regions. We also identified 81,130 regions of variably CpG methylated regions (VMRs), i.e. variable methylation among individuals in the same brain region, which were enriched in regulatory regions and in CpG DMRs. Many VMRs were unique to a specific brain region, with only 202 common across all brain regions, as well as lung and thyroid. VMRs identified in the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus were enriched for heritability of schizophrenia.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThese data suggest that epigenetic variation in these particular human brain regions could be associated with the risk for this neuropsychiatric disorder.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe aggregation of amyloid {beta}-peptides into neurotoxic oligomers is a key feature in the development of Alzheimers disease. Mounting evidence suggests that the neuronal cell membrane is the main site of oligomer-mediated neuronal toxicity. To gain a detailed understanding of the mutual effects of amyloid-{beta} oligomers and the neuronal membrane, we carried out a total of 12 {micro}s all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the dimerization of the full-length A{beta}42 peptide in the presence of a lipid bilayer mimicking the in vivo composition of neuronal membranes. The conformational changes of A{beta}42 resulting from its dimerization and interactions with the neuronal membrane are compared to those occurring upon its dimerization in the aqueous phase, which is also tested by 12 {micro}s of MD simulations. We find that the interactions with the neuronal membrane decrease the order of the A{beta}42 dimer by attenuating its propensity to form a {beta}-sheet structure. The main lipid interaction partners of A{beta}42 are the surface-exposed sugar groups of the gangliosides GM1. A{beta}42 dimerization in solution, on the other hand, is characterized by a random coil to {beta}-sheet transition that seems to be on-pathway to amyloid aggregation. As the neurotoxic activity of amyloid oligomers increases with oligomer order, the results suggest that GM1 is neuroprotective against A{beta}-mediated toxicity by inhibiting the formation of ordered amyloid oligomers.",
