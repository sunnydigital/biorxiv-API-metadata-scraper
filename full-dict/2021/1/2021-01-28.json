    "abstract": "Improving the standard of clinical care for individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants is a global health priority. Small molecule antivirals like remdesivir (RDV) and biologics such as human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. However, it is not known if combination RDV/mAb will improve outcomes over single agent therapies or whether antibody therapies will remain efficacious against variants. In kinetic studies in a mouse-adapted model of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we show that a combination of two mAbs in clinical trials, C144 and C135, have potent antiviral effects against even when initiated 48 hours after infection. The same antibody combination was also effective in prevention and therapy against the B.1.351 variant of concern (VOC). Combining RDV and antibodies provided a modest improvement in outcomes compared to single agents. These data support the continued use of RDV to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections and support the continued clinical development of the C144 and C135 antibody combination to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistant Enterococcus infections are a major health crisis that requires the development of alternative therapies. Phage therapy could be an alternative to antibiotics and has shown promise in in vitro and in early clinical studies. Phage therapy is often deployed as a cocktail of phages, but there is little understanding of how to most effectively combine phages. Here we utilized a collection of 20 Enterococcus phages to test principles of phage cocktail design and determine the phenotypic effects of evolving phage resistance in Enterococcus isolates that were susceptible or resistant to antibiotics (e.g., Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus (VRE)). We tested the ability of each phage to clear Enterococcus host cultures and prevent the emergence of phage resistant Enterococcus. We found that some phages which were ineffective individually were effective at clearing the bacterial culture when used in cocktails. To understand the dynamics within phage cocktails, we used qPCR to track which phages increased in abundance in each cocktail, and saw dynamics ranging from one dominant phage to even phage growth. Further, we isolated several phage-resistant mutants to test for altered Vancomycin sensitivity. We found that mutants tended to have no change or slightly increased resistance to Vancomycin. By demonstrating the efficacy of phage cocktails in suppressing growth of antibiotic susceptible and VRE clinical isolates when exposed to phages, this work will help to inform cocktail design for future phage therapy applications.\n\nIMPORTANCEAntibiotic resistant Enterococcus infections are a major health crisis that requires the development of alternative therapies. Phage therapy could be an alternative to antibiotics and has shown promise in in vitro and in early clinical studies. Phage therapy in the form of cocktails is often suggested, with similar goals as the combination therapy that has been successful in the treatment of HIV infection, but there is little understanding about how to combine phages most effectively. Here we utilized a collection of 20 Enterococcus phages to test whether several phage cocktails could prevent the host from evolving resistance to therapy and to determine whether evolving resistance to phages affected host susceptibility to antibiotics. We showed that cocktails of two or three unrelated phages often prevented the growth of phage-resistant mutants, when the same phages applied individually were not able to.",

    "abstract": "Here we describe a short feasibility study and methodological framework for the production of stable, CRISPR/Cas9-based, large genomic deletions in zebrafish, ranging from several base pairs (bp) to hundreds of kilobases (kb). Using a cocktail of four sgRNAs targeting a single genomic region mixed with a marker-sgRNA against the pigmentation gene tyrosinase (tyr), we demonstrate that one can easily and accurately excise genomic regions such as promoters, protein domains, specific exons or whole genes. We exemplify this technique with a complex gene family, neurexins, composed of three duplicated genes with multiple promoters and intricate splicing processes leading to thousands of isoforms. We precisely deleted small regions such as their transmembrane domains (150bp deletion in average) to their entire genomic locus (300kb deletion for nrxn1A for instance). We find that both the concentration and ratio of Cas9/sgRNAs are critical for the successful generation of these large deletions and, interestingly, that their transmission frequency does not decrease with increasing distance between sgRNA target sites. Considering the growing reports and debate about genetically compensated small indel mutants, the use of large-deletion approaches is likely to be widely adopted in studies of gene function. This strategy will also be key to the study of non-coding genomic regions.",

    "abstract": "Biochemical phenotypes are major indexes for protein structure and function characterization. They are determined, at least in part, by the intrinsic physicochemical properties of amino acids and may be reflected in the protein three-dimensional structure. Modeling mutational effects on biochemical phenotypes is a critical step for understanding protein function and disease mechanism as well as enabling drug discovery. Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) experiments have been performed on SARS-CoV-2s spike receptor binding domain and the human ACE2 zinc-binding peptidase domain - both central players in viral infection and evolution and antibody evasion - quantifying how mutations impact binding affinity and protein expression. Here, we modeled biochemical phenotypes from massively parallel assays, using convolutional neural networks trained on protein sequence mutations in the virus and human host. We found that neural networks are significantly predictive of binding affinity, protein expression, and antibody escape, learning complex interactions and higher-order features that are difficult to capture with conventional methods from structural biology. Integrating the intrinsic physicochemical properties of amino acids, including hydrophobicity, solvent-accessible surface area, and long-range non-bonded energy per atom, significantly improved prediction (empirical p<0.01) though there was such a strong dependence on the sequence data alone to yield reasonably good prediction. We observed concordance of the DMS data and our neural network predictions with an independent study on intermolecular interactions from molecular dynamics (multiple 500 ns or 1 s all-atom) simulations of the spike protein-ACE2 interface, with critical implications for the use of deep learning to dissect molecular mechanisms. The mutation- or genetically-determined component of a biochemical phenotype estimated from the neural networks has improved causal inference properties relative to the original phenotype and can facilitate crucial insights into disease pathophysiology and therapeutic design.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression regulation requires precise transcriptional programs, led by transcription factors in combination with epigenetic events. Recent advances in epigenomic and transcriptomic techniques provided insight into different gene regulation mechanisms. However, to date it remains challenging to understand how combinations of transcription factors together with epigenetic events control cell-type specific gene expression. We developed the AnnoMiner web-server and introduce an innovative and flexible way to annotate and integrate epigenetic, and transcription factor occupancy data. First, AnnoMiner annotates user-provided peaks with gene features. Second, AnnoMiner can integrate genome binding data from two different transcriptional regulators together with gene features. Third, AnnoMiner offers to explore the transcriptional deregulation of 10 genes nearby a user-provided peak. AnnoMiners fourth function performs transcription factor or histone mark enrichment analysis for user-provided gene lists by utilizing hundreds of public, high-quality datasets from ENCODE for the model organisms human, mouse, Drosophila and C. elegans. Thus, AnnoMiner can predict transcriptional regulators for a studied process without the strict need for chromatin data from the same process. We compared AnnoMiner to existing tools and experimentally validated several transcriptional regulators predicted by AnnoMiner to indeed contribute to muscle morphogenesis in Drosophila.

    "abstract": "Both animals and plants utilize nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat immune receptors (NLRs) to perceive the presence of pathogen-derived molecules and induce immune responses. NLR genes are far more abundant and diverse in higher plants. Interestingly, truncated NLRs, which lack one or more of the canonical domains, are also commonly encoded in plant genomes. However, little is known about their functions, especially regarding the N-terminally truncated ones. Here, we show that Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) N-terminally truncated helper NLR gene NRG1C (N REQUIREMENT GENE 1) is highly induced upon pathogen infection and in autoimmune mutants. The immune response and cell death conferred by some TIR (Toll/interleukin-1 receptor)-type NLRs (TNLs) are compromised in the NRG1C overexpression lines. Detailed genetic analysis revealed that NRG1C antagonizes the immunity mediated by its full-length neighbors NRG1A and NRG1B. Biochemical tests indicate that NRG1C possibly interferes with the EDS1-SAG101 complex, which likely signals together with NRG1A/1B. Interestingly, Brassicaceae NRG1Cs are functionally exchangeable, and the Nicotiana benthamiana (N. benthamiana) N-terminally truncated helper NLR NRG2 antagonizes NRG1 in tobacco. Together, our study uncovers an unexpected negative role of N-terminally truncated helper NLRs in different plants.",

In vitro supercoiling assays further suggest a stabilization of the cleavage complex by Gip. Overproduction of Gip in C. glutamicum resulted in a severe growth defect as well as an induction of the SOS response. The cells adapted to gip overexpression by increasing expression levels of gyrAB and by reducing topA expression reflecting the homeostatic control of DNA topology. Interestingly, Gip features a similar activity profile towards gyrases of Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and C. glutamicum. Therefore, the detailed elucidation of the mechanism of Gip action may provide novel directions for the design of drugs targeting DNA gyrase.",

    "abstract": "Embryonic morphogenesis of the neural tube, palate, ventral body wall and optic fissure require precise sequence of tissue movement and fusion, which if incomplete, leads to anencephaly/exencephaly, cleft palate, omphalocele and coloboma, respectively. These are genetically heterogeneous birth defects, so there is a continued need to identify etiologic genes. Patients with autosomal dominant SPECC1L mutations show syndromic malformations, including hypertelorism, cleft palate and omphalocele. These SPECC1L mutations cluster in the second coiled-coil domain (CCD2), which facilitates association with microtubules. To study SPECC1L function in mice, we first generated a null allele (Specc1l{Delta}Ex4) lacking the entire SPECC1L protein. Homozygous mutants for these truncations died perinatally without cleft palate or exencephaly. Given the clustering of human mutations in CCD2, we hypothesized that targeted perturbation of CCD2 may be required. Indeed, homozygotes for in-frame deletions involving CCD2 (Specc1l{Delta}CCD2) resulted in ~50% exencephaly and ~50% cleft palate. Interestingly, these two phenotypes are never observed in the same embryo. Examination of embryos with and without exencephaly revealed that the oral cavity was narrower in exencephalic embryos, which allowed palatal shelves to elevate despite their defect. In contrast to an evenly distributed subcellular expression pattern, mutant SPECC1L-{Delta}CCD2 protein showed abnormal subcellular localization, decreased overlap with microtubules, increased actin bundles, and dislocated non-muscle myosin II to the cell cortex. Thus, we show that perturbations of CCD2 in the context of full SPECC1L protein affects tissue fusion dynamics, indicating that human SPECC1L CCD2 mutations are gain-of-function. Improper SPECC1L subcellular localization appears to disrupt connections between actomyosin and microtubule networks, which in turn may affect cell alignment and coordinate movement during tissue morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Activation of the G protein-coupled receptors by agonists may result in the activation of one or more G proteins, and in the recruitment of arrestins. The balance of activation of different pathways can be influenced by the ligand. Using BRET-based biosensors, we showed that the vasopressin V2 receptor activates or at least engages many different G proteins across all G protein subfamilies in response to its native agonist arginine vasopressin (AVP). This includes members of the Gi/o and G12/13 families that have not been previously reported. These signalling pathways are also activated by the synthetic peptide desmopressin and natural homologs of AVP, namely oxytocin and the non-mammalian hormone vasotocin. They demonstrated varying degrees of functional selectivity relative to AVP, as quantified using the operational model for quantifying ligand bias. Additionally, we modelled G protein activation as a Michaelis-Menten reaction. This approach provided a complementary way to quantify signalling bias, with an added benefit of clear separation of the effects of ligand affinity from the intrinsic activity of the receptor. These results showed that V2 receptor is not only promiscuous in its ability to engage several G proteins, but also that its signalling profile could be easily biased by small structural changes in the ligand.",

Across the syncytial Drosophila embryo surface, smooth interfaces form between expanding Arp2/3-based actin caps and surrounding actomyosin networks, demarcating the circumferences of nascent dome-like compartments used for pseudo-cleavage. We found that smoothening of the actomyosin interfaces requires Arp2/3 in vivo. To dissect the physical basis of this requirement, we reconstituted the interacting networks using node-based models. When actomyosin networks were simulated with clearances instead of Arp2/3 networks, rough boundaries persisted with low levels of myosin contractility. With addition of expanding Arp2/3 networks, network-network interfaces failed to smoothen, but accumulated myosin nodes and tension. After incorporating actomyosin mechanosensitivity, Arp2/3 network growth induced local contractility and smoothening of the interfaces, effects also evident in vivo. In this way, a smooth structure can emerge from the lateral interaction of irregular starting materials.",

We identified NOMO1 in a proteomics approach aimed at the identification of proteins that support the structural integrity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Overexpression of NOMO1 imposes a sheet morphology on the ER, while depletion of NOMO1 and its orthologs causes a collapse of ER morphology concomitant with the formation of membrane-delineated holes in the ER network. These structures are positive for the autophagy marker LAMP1, and LC3 is profoundly upregulated upon NOMO depletion. In vitro reconstitution of NOMO1 revealed a dimeric state that is mediated by the cytosolic tail domain, with each monomer featuring a \"beads on a string\" structure likely representing bacterial Ig-like folds.

    "abstract": "Resident mesenchymal cells (rMCs defined as Cd31NegCd45NegEpcamNeg) control the self-renewal and differentiation of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) stem cells in vitro. The identity of these rMCs is still elusive. Among them, Axin2Pos mesenchymal alveolar niche cells (MANCs), which are expressing Fgf7, have been previously described. We propose that an additional population of rMCs, expressing Fgf10 (called rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos) are equally important to maintain AT2 stem cell self-renewal.\n\nThe alveolosphere model, based on the AT2-rMC co-culture in growth factor reduced Matrigel, was used to test the efficiency of different rMC subpopulations isolated by FACS from adult murine lung to sustain the self-renewal and differentiation of AT2 stem cells.\n\nWe demonstrate that rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos cells are efficient to promote the self-renewal and differentiation of AT2 stem cells. Co-staining of adult lung for Fgf10 mRNA and Sftpc protein respectively, indicate that 28% of Fgf10Pos cells are located close to AT2 cells. Co-ISH for Fgf7 and Fgf10 indicate that these two populations do not significantly overlap. Gene arrays comparing rMC-Sca1PosAxin2Pos and rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos support that these two cell subsets express differential markers. In addition, rMC function is decreased in diabetic and obese ob/ob mutant compared to WT mice with a much stronger loss of function in males compared to females.\n\nIn conclusion, rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos cells play important role in supporting AT2 stem cells self-renewal and differentiation. This result sheds a new light on the subpopulations of rMCs contributing to the AT2 stem cell niche in homeostasis and in the context of COVID-19 pathogenesis.\n\nKey messageO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about the subject?C_ST_ABSResident mesenchymal cells (rMCs defined as Cd31NegCd45NegEpcamNeg) control the self-renewal and differentiation of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) stem cells in vitro. The identity of these rMCs is still elusive. Among them, Axin2Pos mesenchymal alveolar niche cells (MANCs), which are expressing Fgf7, have been previously described.\n\nWhat does this study add?Our study shows that an additional population of rMCs, expressing Fgf10 (called rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos) is equally important to maintain AT2 stem cell self-renewal. rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos are LipidToxHigh and are located close to AT2s. In addition, rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos cells support AT2 stem cell self-renewal and differentiation thereby identifying these cells as bone fide functional lipofibroblasts (LIFs). We have previously reported that LIF can transdifferentiate into activated MYF in the context of bleomycin-induced fibrosis in mice [1] and that activated MYF isolated from the lungs of end stage idiopathic fibrosis human patients can respond to Metformin to undergo transdifferentiation back to the LIF phenotype [2]. We also show that the function of rMCs-Sca1Pos is negatively impacted by gender and obesity, which represent two major aggravating factors for COVID-19 pathogenesis, leading to either death or major complications after infection recovery such as lung fibrosis.\n\nHow might this impact on clinical practice and future development?By establishing that rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos are different from the MANCs, our study opens the way for a new key mesenchymal cell population that should be targeted to either prevent or reverse fibrosis. In addition, as this population maintains the AT2 stem cells self-renewal and differentiation, such targeting will also allow to progressively recover the loss in respiratory function.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms underlying intraspecific variation in life history strategies are still poorly understood, despite the importance of this question for understanding of organisms responses to environmental variability. Theoretical work proposed that epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation might regulate intraspecific variation in life history strategies, however this assumption has rarely been verified empirically in wild populations. We examined associations between genome-wide methylation changes and environmentally-driven life history variation in two lineages of a marine fish that diverged approximatively 2.5 Mya, the capelin (Mallotus villosus), from North America and Europe. In both lineages, capelin harbour two contrasted life history strategies: some are strictly semelparous, experience fast actuarial senescence, but benefit from high hatching success by spawning on demersal sites where water temperature is low and relatively stable. In contrast, others are facultative iteroparous, have slower actuarial senescence, and suffer from lower hatching success by breeding in the intertidal zone where temperature is warmer, thermohaline parameters are less stable, and egg desiccation risk is high. Performing whole genome and epigenome sequencing, we showed that these contrasted life history strategies are more likely governed by epigenetic changes than by differences in DNA sequence. While genetic differentiation between the capelin harbouring different life history strategies was negligible, we detected parallel genome-wide methylation changes across lineages. We identified 1,067 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) comprising 15,818 CpGs, with 22% of them located within 5-kb around genes comprising promotor regions. We found that all DMRs were hypermethylated in demersal-spawning individuals. This striking result suggests that lower water temperature at demersal sites leads to an overall hypermethylation of the genome determined during the epigenetic reprogramming occurring over embryonic development. Our study emphasizes that parallel epigenetics changes in lineages with divergent genetic background could have a functional role in the regulation of intraspecific life history variation.",

    "abstract": "A critical challenge in genetic diagnostics is the computational assessment of candidate splice variants, specifically the interpretation of nucleotide changes located outside of the highly conserved dinucleotide sequences at the 5' and 3' ends of introns. To address this gap, we developed the Super Quick Informationcontent Random-forest Learning of Splice variants (SQUIRLS) algorithm. SQUIRLS generates a small set of interpretable features for machine learning by calculating the information-content (IC) of wildtype and variant sequences of canonical and cryptic splice sites, assessing changes in candidate splicing regulatory sequences, and incorporating characteristics of the sequence such as exon length, disruptions of the AG exclusion zone, and conservation. We curated a comprehensive collection of disease-associated splicealtering variants at positions outside of the highly conserved AG/GT dinucleotides at the termini of introns. SQUIRLS trains two random-forest classifiers for the donor and for the acceptor and combines their outputs by logistic regression to yield a final score. We show that SQUIRLS transcends previous state of the art accuracy in classifying splice variants as assessed by rank analysis in simulated exomes and is significantly faster than competing methods. SQUIRLS provides tabular output files for incorporation into diagnostic pipelines for exome and genome analysis, as well as visualizations that contextualize predicted effects of variants on splicing to make it easier to interpret splice variants in diagnostic settings",

    "abstract": "0Single cell transcriptomic technologies enable genome-wide gene expression measurements in individual cells but can only provide a static snapshot of cell states. RNA velocity analysis can infer cell state changes from single cell transcriptomics data. To interpret these cell state changes as part of underlying cellular trajectories, current approaches rely on visualization with principal components, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, and other 2D embeddings derived from the observed single cell transcriptional states. However, these 2D embeddings can yield different representations of the underlying cellular trajectories, hindering the interpretation of cell state changes. We developed VeloViz to create RNA-velocity-informed 2D and 3D embeddings from single cell transcriptomics data. Using both real and simulated data, we demonstrate that VeloViz embeddings are able to consistently capture underlying cellular trajectories across diverse trajectory topologies, even when intermediate cell states may be missing. By taking into consideration the predicted future transcriptional states from RNA velocity analysis, VeloViz can help visualize a more reliable representation of underlying cellular trajectories. VeloViz is available as an R package on GitHub (https://github.com/JEFworks-Lab/veloviz) with additional tutorials at https://JEF.works/veloviz/.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to predict autoimmunity-related pathological mechanisms that possess risk for individuals with specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) serotypes and shared by certain coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, based on homology to a SARS-CoV-2 peptide. With the given aim, 1-) coronavirus-associated sequences, which are homologous to the 15mer SARS-CoV-2 peptide CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC, are obtained. 2-) Human peptides that have at least 7 residue matches with those coronavirus sequences, and the SARS-CoV-2 15mer, are found. 3-) Epitope pairs, which are sourced by those aligned coronavirus and human sequences are identified. 4-) Epitope pairs that are predicted to bind strongly not only to the same HLA allele with each other but also to the same HLA allele as those of the respective alignment of the SARS-CoV-2 peptide are selected. Following are the identified proteins or peptides (with HLA-A*02:01 or HLA-A*24:02 epitopes), as described in 1-to-4: Immunoglobulin heavy chain junction regions, CRB1 isoform I precursor, slit homolog 2 protein, hCG1995581, hCG2028737, phospholipid phosphatase-related protein type 2. Among those, CRB1 isoform I precursor sequence with the predicted HLA-A*24:02 epitope aligns with the highest number of different sequences. Results imply autoimmunity risk in COVID-19 patients with HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*24:02 serotypes, through molecular mimicry, as a shared pathogenicity risk that can be prevalent upon getting infected with certain coronaviruses. These can pave way to improved risk groups assessment and autoimmunity treatment options, for COVID-19 and its associated diseases. Also, the approach in this study can be used to predict prospective pathologies of the transmissible variants in susceptible humans.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to an urgent need to understand the molecular basis for immune recognition of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein antigenic sites. To define the genetic and structural basis for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we determined the structures of two human monoclonal antibodies COV2-2196 and COV2-21301, which form the basis of the investigational antibody cocktail AZD7442, in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. COV2-2196 forms an \"aromatic cage\" at the heavy/light chain interface using germline-encoded residues in complementarity determining regions (CDRs) 2 and 3 of the heavy chain and CDRs 1 and 3 of the light chain. These structural features explain why highly similar antibodies (public clonotypes) have been isolated from multiple individuals1-4. The structure of COV2-2130 reveals that an unusually long LCDR1 and HCDR3 make interactions with the opposite face of the RBD from that of COV2-2196. Using deep mutational scanning and neutralization escape selection experiments, we comprehensively mapped the critical residues of both antibodies and identified positions of concern for possible viral escape. Nonetheless, both COV2-2196 and COV2-2130 showed strong neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 strain with recent variations of concern including E484K, N501Y, and D614G substitutions. These studies reveal germline-encoded antibody features enabling recognition of the RBD and demonstrate the activity of a cocktail like AZD7442 in preventing escape from emerging variant viruses.",

A maximum current density of (255{+/-} 71) {micro}A cm-2 was obtained with 286 nm fiber diameter material. Additionally, micro-and mesoporosity were introduced by CO2 and steam activation which did not improve the current production significantly. The current production is directly linked to the biofilm dry mass under anaerobic and micro-aerobic conditions. Our findings suggest that either the surface area or the pore size related to the fiber diameter determines the attractiveness of the anodes as habitat and there-fore biofilm formation and current production.

    "abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants poses greater challenges to the control of COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we parallelly investigated three important characteristics of seven SARS-CoV-2 variants, including two mink-associated variants, the B.1.617.1 variant, and the four WHO-designated variants of concerns (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.617.2). We first investigated the ability of these variants to bind and use animal ACE2 orthologs as entry receptor. We found that, in contrast to a prototype variant, the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants had significantly enhanced affinities to cattle, pig, and mouse ACE2 proteins, suggesting increased susceptibility of these species to these SARS-CoV-2 variants. We then evaluated in vitro neutralization sensitivity of these variants to four monoclonal antibodies in clinical use. We observed that all the variants were partially or completely resistant against at least one of the four tested antibodies, with B.1.351 and P.1 showing significant resistance to three of them. As ACE2-Ig is a broad-spectrum anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidate, we then evaluated in vitro neutralization sensitivity of these variants to eight ACE2-Ig constructs previously described in three different studies. All the SARS-CoV-2 variants were efficiently neutralized by these ACE2-Ig constructs. Interestingly, compared to the prototype variant, most tested variants including the variants of concern B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.617.2 showed significantly increased (up to [~]15-fold) neutralization sensitivity to ACE2-Ig constructs that are not heavily mutated in the spike-binding interface of the soluble ACE2 domain, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 evolves toward better utilizing ACE2, and that ACE2-Ig is an attractive drug candidate for coping with SARS-CoV-2 mutations.",

Here we report robust, widespread transcription within the first minutes of quiescence exit. During quiescence, the chromatin-remodeling enzyme RSC was already bound to the genes induced upon quiescence exit. RSC depletion caused severe quiescence exit defects: a global decrease in RNA polymerase II (Pol II) loading, Pol II accumulation at transcription start sites, initiation from ectopic upstream loci, and aberrant antisense transcription. These phenomena were due to a combination of highly robust Pol II transcription and severe chromatin defects in the promoter regions and gene bodies. Together, these results uncovered multiple mechanisms by which RSC facilitates initiation and maintenance of large-scale, rapid gene expression despite a globally repressive chromatin state.",

The current assumption is that men are at higher risk of epithelial cancers as they expose more to carcinogens and accumulate more damage than women. We present data showing women are more protected from aggressive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) due to strong immune activation.\n\nMethodsWe explored clinical and molecular sexual disparity in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients (N= 738, N=160) with carcinoma cSCC, in FVB/N mice exposed to equal doses of DMBA, and in human keratinocytes by whole exome sequencing, bulk and single cell RNA sequencing.\n\nResultsWe show cSCC is more aggressive in men, and immunocompetent women develop mild cSCC, later in life. To test if sex drives disparity, we exposed male and female mice to equal doses of carcinogen, and found males present more aggressive, metastatic cSCC than females. Critically, females activate cancer immune-related expression pathways and CD4 and CD8 T cell infiltration independently of mutations. In contrast, males increase the rate of mitoses and proliferation in response to carcinogen. Human female skin and keratinocytes also activate immune-cancer fighting pathways and immune cells at ultraviolet radiation-damaged sites. Critically, a compromised immune system leads to high-risk, aggressive cSCC specifically in women.\n\nConclusionsThis work shows the immune response is sex biased in cSCC, and highlights female immunity offers greater protection than male immunity.",

    "abstract": "Sampling circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using liquid biopsies offers clinically important benefits for monitoring cancer progression. A single ctDNA sample represents a mixture of shed tumor DNA from all known and unknown lesions within a patient. Although shedding levels have been suggested to hold the key to identifying targetable lesions and uncovering treatment resistance mechanisms, the amount of DNA shed by any one specific lesion is still not well characterized. We designed the Lesion Shedding Model (LSM) to order lesions from the strongest to the poorest shedding for a given patient. By characterizing the lesion-specific ctDNA shedding levels, we can better understand the mechanisms of shedding and more accurately interpret ctDNA assays to improve their clinical impact. We verified the accuracy of the LSM under controlled conditions using a simulation approach as well as testing the model on three cancer patients. The LSM obtained an accurate partial order of the lesions according to their assigned shedding levels in simulations and its accuracy in identifying the top shedding lesion was not impacted by number of lesions. Applying LSM to three cancer patients, we found that indeed there were lesions that consistently shed more than others into the patients blood. In two of the patients, the top shedding lesion was one of the only clinically progressing lesions at the time of biopsy suggesting a connection between high ctDNA shedding and clinical progression. The LSM provides a much needed framework with which to understand ctDNA shedding and interpret ctDNA assays.\n\nAvailabilityBinary is available at https://github.com/ComputationalGenomics/LSM",

    "abstract": "Scavenger receptor class F member 1 (SCARF1) has previously been shown to be highly expressed within the human liver, hold prognostic value in hepatocellular carcinoma and mediate the specific recruitment of leukocytes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells; however, to date, the liver remains the only major organ in which SCARF1 has been explored in any detail. Here, we utilised publically-available RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA) to identify the lungs as a site of significant SCARF1 expression and attribute the majority of its expression to endothelial cell populations. Next, we show that SCARF1 expression is significantly reduced in two histologically distinct types of non-small cell lung carcinoma cancers (NSCLCs), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), compared to non-tumoural tissues. Interestingly, loss of SCARF1 expression was associated with aggressive tumour biology in LUAD tissues, but not in LUSC. Furthermore, increased SCARF1 expression was highly prognostic of better overall survival in LUAD tumour tissues, but this was again in contrast to LUSC tumours, in which SCARF1 held no prognostic value. Finally, we showed that SCARF1 is widely expressed in tumour endothelial cells of non-small cell lung cancers and that its total expression in LUAD tumour tissues correlated with immune score and CD4+ T cell infiltration. This study represents the first detailed exploration of SCARF1 expression in normal and diseased human lung tissues and further highlights the prognostic value and therapeutic potential of SCARF1 in immunologically active cancers.",

Intratumoral heterogeneity, which is frequently driven by epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity significantly contributes to the limited treatment response, chemoresistance, and subsequent poor prognosis of patients with lethal PCa.\n\nMethodsWe employed a high-throughput flow cytometry screening to identify cell surface fingerprint that associates with docetaxel resistance in PCa cells. Using patient-derived xenografts, we validated protein expression of the most robustly changed antigens in vivo and further assessed this 6-molecule surface fingerprint in primary PCa tumors.\n\nResultsWe revealed the overexpression of SSEA-4 antigen in both in vitro and in vivo docetaxel-resistant models and confirmed the SSEA-4 enrichment in a subpopulation of freshly isolated primary PCa tumors. The level of ST3GAL2, an enzyme that is critically involved in the SSEA-4 synthesis, correlated with increased expression of CD44, CD59, and CD95 and reduced expression of EpCAM and CD9. SSEA-4 was further directly linked to the antimicrotubule agent resistance and poor prognosis in PCa patients.\n\nConclusionsWe propose that the 6-molecule surface fingerprint associates with docetaxel resistance and pre-exists in a cell subpopulation of primary PCa tumors even before docetaxel treatment.",

    "abstract": "Immune recognition in plants is governed by two major classes of receptors: pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs). Located at the cell surface, PRRs bind extracellular ligands originating from microbes (indicative of  non-self) or damaged plant cells (indicative of  infected-self), and trigger signaling cascades to protect against infection. Located intracellularly, NLRs sense pathogen-induced physiological changes and trigger localized cell death and systemic resistance. Immune responses are under tight regulation in order to maintain homeostasis and promote plant health. In a forward-genetic screen to identify regulators of PRR-mediated immune signaling, we identified a novel allele of the membrane-attack complex and perforin (MACPF)-motif containing protein CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVE DEFENSE 1 (CAD1) resulting from a missense mutation in a conserved N-terminal cysteine. We show that cad1-5 mutants display deregulated immune signaling and symptoms of autoimmunity dependent on the lipase-like protein ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY1 (EDS1), suggesting that CAD1 integrity is monitored by the plant immune system. We further demonstrate that CAD1 localizes to both the cytosol and plasma membrane using confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation. Our results offer new insights into immune homeostasis and provide tools to further decipher the intriguing role of MACPF proteins in plants.",

Projections from 33 climate models under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 were used for simulations at 17 sites. Using adapted sowing times, we simulated significantly shorter crop cycles and grain yield improvements for the period 2036-2065 relative to 1990-2019 for three selected cultivars (Hartog, Scout and Gregory). Photoperiod and vernalisation sensitivities were shown to be the largest and smallest contributors to total uncertainties in the simulated flowering day and grain yield. Uncertainties in climate models had a relatively minor contribution to the total uncertainties in the simulated values of target traits.

Despite its importance, very little is known about the genetic basis of softwood biosynthesis. Glucomannan and xylan are the main hemicelluloses in softwood secondary cell walls. Xylan interacts with the cellulose fibrils in a two-fold screw configuration. Moreover, we have shown that xylan GUX (GlucUronic acid substitution of Xylan)-dependent branching with glucuronic acid is critical for biomass recalcitrance. Here, we investigated the decoration patterns of xylan by softwood GUX enzymes. Using in vitro and in planta assays we demonstrate that two distinct clades of conifer GUX enzymes are active glucuronyltransferases. Interestingly, these enzymes have different specific activities, with one adding evenly spaced GlcA branches and the other one being also capable of glucuronidating two consecutive xyloses. Since xylan patterning might modulate xylan-cellulose and xylan-lignin interactions, our result further the understanding of softwood biosynthesis and can contribute to strategies aimed at modifying softwood cell wall properties.",

    "abstract": "Larval Drosophila are used as a genetically accessible study case in many areas of biological research. Here we report a fast, robust and user-friendly procedure for the whole-body multifluorescence imaging of Drosophila larvae; the protocol has been optimized specifically for larvae by systematically tackling the pitfalls associated with clearing this small but cuticularized organism. Tests on various fluorescent proteins reveal that the recently introduced monomeric infrared fluorescent protein (mIFP) is particularly suitable for our approach. This approach comprises an effective, low-cost clearing protocol with minimal handling time and reduced toxicity in the reagents employed. It combines a success rate high enough to allow for small-scale screening approaches and a resolution sufficient for cellular-resolution analyses with light sheet and confocal microscopy. Given that publications and database documentations typically specify expression patterns of transgenic driver lines only within a given organ system of interest, the present procedure should be versatile enough to extend such documentation systematically to the whole body. As examples, the expression patterns of transgenic driver lines covering the majority of neurons, or subsets of chemosensory, central brain or motor neurons, are documented in the context of whole larval body volumes (using nsyb-Gal4, IR76b-Gal4, APL-Gal4 and mushroom body Kenyon cells, or OK371-Gal4, respectively). Notably, the presented protocol allows for triple-color fluorescence imaging with near-infrared, red and yellow fluorescent proteins.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHippocampus can be divided along its longitudinal axis into dorsal and ventral parts. Both are usually committed to modulate different aspects of behavior and stress response. However, it is not clear whether the hippocampal subregions could differently modulate the effect of antidepressant drugs. Since fluoxetine (FLX) effect on extinction of aversive memory is well known to depend on hippocampal BDNF levels, we hypothesized that the hippocampal subregions might play different roles in fluoxetine efficacy in decreasing fear response.\n\nMethodWistar rats were fear-cued conditioned and treated chronically with fluoxetine to enhance their subsequent extinction memory. First, FLX effect on BDNF levels was assessed considering the dorsal (dHC) and ventral (vHC) hippocampus apart. Then, K252a (a functional Trk blocker) was infused either into the dHC or vHC to assay its interaction with FLX treatment over the fear response. Next, BDNF was directly infused into either the dHC or vHC to compare its behavioral effects with FLX. Finally, FLX effect on c-Fos expression was evaluated also considering the dHC and vHC apart, along with subareas of amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex.\n\nResultsChronic FLX treatment increased BDNF in the dHC, whereas BDNF was increased in the vHC after acute treatment only. K252a infused after the extinction protocol into either dHC or vHC was able to prevent FLX effect on fear response. BDNF directly infused into the dHC increased fear response, however its administration into the vHC induced an opposite effect. Besides, a negative correlation between the fear response and c-Fos expression was observed after chronic FLX treatment specifically in the dHC CA3/CA1 and vHC CA1/DG.\n\nConclusionBoth dHC and vHC are important for the Trk-dependent FLX effect on extinction memory, although a discrepancy on the fear response was observed with the direct infusion of BDNF into the dHC or vHC.",

    "abstract": "Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites, is a devastating disease that kills over half a million people each year1. Plasmodium sporozoites inoculated by mosquitoes into mammalian hosts undergo a clinically silent phase of obligatory development and replication in hepatocytes before initiating the life-threatening blood-stage of malaria2. Thus, understanding the immune responses elicited by Plasmodium infection in the liver is key to controlling clinical malaria and transmission3,4. Here, we show that Plasmodium DNA can be detected by AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) sensors in the infected hepatocytes, resulting in Caspase-1 activation and pyroptotic cell-death. However, Caspase-1 was observed to undergo only partial cleavage in hepatocytes, limiting pyroptosis, and the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines classically associated with Caspase-1 activation. We discovered that the extent of Caspase-1 cleavage in cells is determined by the expression of ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD). ASC expression is inherently low in hepatocytes, and transgenically enhancing it in the hepatocytes induced complete processing of Caspase-1, efficient secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, enhanced pyroptotic cell-death, and markedly improved control of malaria infection in the liver. In addition to describing a novel pathway of natural immunity to malaria, our findings uncover a key aspect of liver biology that may have been exploited during evolution by successful hepatotropic pathogens.",

We applied electron cryo-microscopy for high-resolution mapping of elicited polyclonal antibody responses, which provided detailed insights into the binding modes of the most common classes of antibodies elicited by BG505 SOSIP immunogens as well as the critical differences in immunogenicity that can occur as a consequence of engineered stabilizing mutations and partial glycan occupancy at different sites.\n\nSummaryEngineered ectodomain trimer immunogens based on BG505 envelope glycoprotein are widely utilized as components of HIV vaccine development platforms. In this study, we used rhesus macaques to evaluate the immunogenicity of several stabilized BG505 SOSIP constructs both as free trimers and presented on a nanoparticle. We applied a cryoEM-based method for high-resolution mapping of polyclonal antibody responses elicited in immunized animals (cryoEMPEM). Mutational analysis coupled with neutralization assays were used to probe the neutralization potential at each epitope. We demonstrate that cryoEMPEM data can be used for rapid, high-resolution analysis of polyclonal antibody responses without the need for monoclonal antibody isolation. This approach allowed to resolve structurally distinct classes of antibodies that bind overlapping sites. In addition to comprehensive mapping of commonly targeted neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitopes in BG505 SOSIP immunogens, our analysis revealed that epitopes comprising engineered stabilizing mutations and of partially occupied glycosylation sites can be immunogenic.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "In a context of rapid climate change, the influence of large-scale and local climate on population demography is increasingly scrutinized, yet studies are usually focused on one population. Demographic parameters, including survival, can vary significantly across populations of a given species, depending on global or local climatic fluctuations but also on many other population-specific parameters such as breeding density, habitat naturalness, predation or parasitism. Such ecological differences between populations could lead to different paces-of-life (POL), whereby populations where individuals display higher reproductive investment and bolder behaviours would have lower survival probabilities. We use here long-term (19 to 38 years) monitoring datasets from four Mediterranean populations of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) to investigate the effects of sex, age class, large-scale and local climate temporal variation and population breeding density, on adult survival, using Capture-Mark-Recapture modelling. Environment heterogeneity in these four populations (two in evergreen and two in deciduous forests) has been linked to strong multi-trait phenotypic variation, suggesting blue tits in deciduous forests display faster POL compared to their conspecifics in evergreen habitats. The present results show heterogeneity in average survival probabilities across the four populations, with, as predicted, lower survival in the  fast blue tits occupying deciduous habitats. Interestingly, the year-to-year variation in survival probabilities was synchronous among populations. This suggests that regional environmental conditions could drive survival fluctuations across populations. However, breeding densities were not correlated across populations, and we found no evidence that adult survival is correlated with either large-scale or local, climate temporal variation in these four blue tit populations. Finally, two of the focal populations displayed a linear temporal decrease in adult survival over the study period, calling for further investigation to explain this decline. Overall, this multi-site study shows that blue tit parental survival from one spring to the next can vary substantially across years, in a synchronous way across populations, yet the climate indices we used are not correlated with the temporal variation. This calls for further investigations in other potential drivers such as resource (in particular insect) abundance, predation or parasitism.",

Here, we present a general approach for quantifying the role hosts and vectors play in transmission that integrates species physiological competence with their ecological traits. We apply this model to the medically important arbovirus Ross River virus (RRV), in Brisbane, Australia. We found that vertebrate species with high physiological competence werent the most important for community transmission. Instead, we estimated that humans (previously overlooked as epidemiologically important hosts) potentially play an important role in RRV transmission, in part, because highly competent vectors readily feed on them and are highly abundant. By contrast, vectors with high physiological competence were also important for community transmission. Finally, we uncovered two potential transmission cycles: an enzootic cycle involving birds and an urban cycle involving humans. This modelling approach has direct application to other zoonotic arboviruses.",

Like all genomes, oDNA must be able to evolve to suit new environmental challenges. However, mixed oDNA populations can challenge cellular bioenergetics, providing a penalty to the appearance and adaptation of new mutations. Here we show that organelle  bottlenecks, mechanisms increasing cell-to-cell oDNA variability during development, can overcome this mixture penalty and facilitate the adaptation of beneficial mutations. We show that oDNA heteroplasmy and bottlenecks naturally emerge in evolutionary simulations subjected to fluctuating environments, demonstrating that this evolvability is itself evolvable. Usually thought of as a mechanism to clear damaging mutations, organelle bottlenecks therefore also resolve the tension between intracellular selection for pure oDNA populations and the  bet-hedging need for evolvability and adaptation to new environments. This general theory suggests a reason for the maintenance of organelle heteroplasmy in cells, and may explain some of the observed diversity in organelle maintenance and inheritance across taxa.",

    "abstract": "Correlation between dihedral fluctuations is a possible way to understand coordination between various amino acid residues of the protein. The nanosecond timescales of correlated fluctuations of dihedral angle do not allow direct probing by experimental methods. However, NMR experiments probe dipolar fluctuations given in terms of cross correlated relaxation (CCR) rates, expressed as zero frequency spectral density function (J) of the fluctuations of the mutual orientation of two spatially separated dipole vectors. Here we illustrate the correlation of protein dipolar and dihedral angle using molecular dynamics simulation of protein Ubiquitin (Ub) and GB3. We calculate CCR rates between protein bond vector from simulation and compare with CCR data obtained from NMR experiments. A good correlation between theoretical and experimental values is found. We further show that the zero frequency spectral functions of backbone dihedral{psi} auto-correlation function and dipole orientation fluctuations show strong correlations. These correlations are not sensitive to protein and forcefield parameters. Hence, CCR may act as a marker for protein backbone dihedral fluctuations.",

A 481 bp of upstream sequence from ATG is found to be sufficient to promote wound inducible gene expression. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of several regulatory elements implicated in wound inducible gene expression. Comparative analysis with similar wound inducible promoters revealed the presence of common cis-regulatory elements.

In this work we show how mutagenic ssDNA recombineering of camel-derived nanobodies encoded in a bacterial genome enables clonal hyper-diversification and the rise of new properties. As a proof-of-principle we used a nanobody recognizing the antigen TirM from enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and evolved it towards the otherwise not recognized TirM antigen from enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). To this end, E. coli cells displaying on their surface this nanobody fused to the intimin outer membrane anchor domain were subjected to multiple rounds of mutagenic ssDNA recombineering targeted to the CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 regions of its genomically encoded VHH sequence. Binders to the new antigen (EPEC TirM) were then selected upon immunomagnetic capture of bacteria bearing the corresponding nanobody variants. As a result, several modified nanobodies were identified which maintained recognition of EHEC TirM but acquired the ability to bind the new antigen with high affinity (Kd ~20 nM). The results highlight the power of combining evolutionary properties of bacteria in vivo with oligonucleotide synthesis in vitro for the sake of focusing diversification to specific segments of a gene (or protein thereof) of interest. Our experimental workflow empowers the evolution of nanobodies displayed on the surface of bacterial cells for a large number of potential applications in medical and industrial biotechnology.",

Although the cell subsets constituting the mononuclear phagocyte network are thought to be similar in both small and large intestine, these organs have distinct anatomy, microbial composition, and immunological demands. Whether these distinctions demand organ-specific mononuclear phagocyte populations with dedicated organ-specific roles in immunity are unknown. Here we implement a new strategy to subset murine intestinal mononuclear phagocytes and identify two novel subsets which are colon-specific: a macrophage subset and a Th17-inducing dendritic cell (DC) subset. Colon-specific DCs and macrophages co-expressed CD24 and CD14, and surprisingly, both were dependent on the transcription factor IRF4. Novel IRF4-dependent CD14+CD24+ macrophages were markedly distinct from conventional macrophages and failed to express classical markers including CX3CR1, CD64 and CD88, and surprisingly expressed little IL-10, which was otherwise robustly expressed by all other intestinal macrophages. We further found that colon-specific CD14+CD24+ mononuclear phagocytes were essential for Th17 immunity in the colon, and provide definitive evidence that colon and small intestine have distinct antigen presenting cell requirements for Th17 immunity. Our findings reveal unappreciated organ-specific diversity of intestine-resident mononuclear phagocytes and organ-specific requirements for Th17 immunity.",

    "abstract": "Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are one of the most ancient and ubiquitous prosthetic groups, and they are required by a variety of proteins involved in important metabolic processes. Apicomplexan parasites have inherited different plastidic and mitochondrial Fe-S clusters biosynthesis pathways through endosymbiosis. We have investigated the relative contributions of these pathways to the fitness of Toxoplasma gondii, an apicomplexan parasite causing disease in humans, by generating specific mutants. Phenotypic analysis and quantitative proteomics allowed us to highlight notable differences in these mutants. Both Fe-S cluster synthesis pathways are necessary for optimal parasite growth in vitro, but their disruption leads to markedly different fates: impairment of the plastidic pathway leads to a loss of the organelle and to parasite death, while disruption of the mitochondrial pathway trigger differentiation into a stress resistance stage. This highlights that otherwise similar biochemical pathways hosted by different sub-cellular compartments can have very different contributions to the biology of the parasites, which is something to consider when exploring novel strategies for therapeutic intervention.\n\nAuthor summaryToxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous unicellular parasite that harbours two organelles of endosymbiotic origin: the mitochondrion, and a relict plastid named the apicoplast. Each one of these organelles contains its own machinery for synthesizing iron-sulfur clusters, which are important protein co- factors. In this study, we show that interfering with either the mitochondrial or the plastidic iron- sulfur cluster synthesizing machinery has a profound impact on parasite growth. However, while disrupting the plastidic pathway led to an irreversible loss of the organelle and subsequent death of the parasite, disrupting the mitochondrial pathway led to conversion of the parasites into a stress resistance form. We used a comparative quantitative proteomic analysis of the mutants, combined with experimental validation, to provide mechanistic clues into these different phenotypic outcomes. Although the consequences of disrupting each pathway were manifold, our data highlighted distinct changes at the metabolic level. For instance, the plastidic iron-sulfur cluster synthesis pathway is likely important for maintaining the lipid homeostasis of the parasites, while the mitochondrial pathway is clearly crucial for maintaining their respiratory capacity. Interestingly, we have discovered that other mutants severely impacted for mitochondrial function, in particular the respiratory chain, are able to survive and initiate conversion to the stress resistance form. This illustrates a different capacity for T. gondii to adapt for survival in response to distinct metabolic dysregulations.",

In particular, multi-species coexistence in biofilms can provide the synergy needed to boost biomass production and enhance treatment resistance. In this study, a total of 37 bacterial strains were isolated from a cooling tower where acetic acid and propionic acid were used as the primary carbon sources. These isolates mainly belonged to Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, which occupied more than 80% of the total strains according to the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Four species (Acinetobacter sp. CTS3, Corynebacterium sp. CTS5, Providencia sp. CTS12, and Pseudomonas sp. CTS17) were observed to co-exist in the synthetic medium, showing a synergistic effect towards biofilm formation. Three metabolic inhibitors (sulfathiazole, 3-Bromopyruvic acid, and 3-Nitropropionic acid) were employed as possible treatments against biofilm formation due to their inhibition effect on c-di-GMP biosynthesis or assimilation of volatile fatty acids. All of them displayed evident inhibition profiles to biofilm formation. Notably, the combination of these three inhibitors possessed a remarkable ability to block the development of a multi-species biofilm with lower concentrations, suggesting an enhanced effect with their simultaneous use. This study demonstrates that targeting cellular metabolism is an effective way to inhibit biofilm formation derived from multi-species.",

The cellular membrane, a crucial site in host-pathogen interactions, is poorly characterized in streptococci. Moreover, little is known about whether or how environmental conditions influence their lipid compositions. Using normal phase liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, we characterized the phospholipids and glycolipids of S. pneumoniae, GAS, and GBS in routine undefined laboratory medium, streptococcal defined medium, and, in order to mimic the host environment, defined medium supplemented with human serum. In human serum-supplemented medium, all three streptococcal species synthesize phosphatidylcholine (PC), a zwitterionic phospholipid commonly found in eukaryotes but relatively rare in bacteria. We previously reported that S. pneumoniae utilizes the glycerophosphocholine (GPC) biosynthetic pathway to synthesize PC. Through substrate tracing experiments, we confirm that GAS and GBS scavenge lysoPC, a major metabolite in human serum, thereby using an abbreviated GPC pathway for PC biosynthesis. Furthermore, we found that plasmanyl-PC is uniquely present in the GBS membrane during growth with human serum, suggesting GBS possesses unusual membrane biochemical or biophysical properties. In summary, we report cellular lipid remodeling by the major pathogenic streptococci in response to metabolites present in human serum.",

Methods have been developed for estimating microbial interaction networks, of which the generalized Lotka-Volterra equation (gLVE)-based method can estimate a directed interaction network. The previous gLVE-based method for estimating microbial interaction networks did not consider time-varying interactions.\n\nResultsIn this study, we developed unsupervised learning based microbial interaction inference method using Bayesian estimation (Umibato), a method for estimating time-varying microbial interactions. The Umibato algorithm comprises Gaussian process regression (GPR) and a new Bayesian probabilistic model, the continuous-time regression hidden Markov model (CTRHMM). Growth rates are estimated by GPR, and interaction networks are estimated by CTRHMM. CTRHMM can estimate time-varying interaction networks using interaction states, which are defined as hidden variables. Umibato outperformed the existing methods on synthetic datasets. In addition, it yielded reasonable estimations in experiments on a mouse gut microbiota dataset, thus providing novel insights into the relationship between consumed diets and the gut microbiota.\n\nAvailabilityThe C++ and python source codes of the Umibato software are available at https://github.com/shion-h/Umibato\n\nContactshion_hosoda@asagi.waseda.jp, mhamada@waseda.jp",

    "abstract": "Within the family Herpesviridae, sub-family {beta}-herpesvirinae, and genus Roseolovirus, there are only three human herpesviruses that have been discovered and described: HHV-6A, HHV-6B, and HHV-7. Initially, HHV-6A and HHV-6B were considered to be simply two variants of the same virus (i.e., HHV6). Despite high overall genetic sequence identity (~90%), HHV-6A and HHV-6B are now recognized as two distinct viruses of the genus. Limited sequence identity (e.g., <70%) in key coding regions as well as significant differences in physiological and biochemical profiles (e.g., preferential use of different receptors for viral entry into susceptible hosts) underscore the conclusion that HHV-6A and HHV-6B are distinct virus species. Likewise, each virus appears to differentially contribute as putative etiologic agents to a variety of neurological disorders, including: multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and chronic fatigue syndrome. Despite being implicated as causative agents in nervous system dysfunction, mechanisms of action and relative contributions of each virus to neural disorders remain elusive. Unresolved questions regarding: cell receptor use and binding affinity (i.e., CD49 versus CD134); cell tropism; the role of HHV-7 superinfection; and, relative virulence between HHV-6A versus HHV-6B - prevent a complete characterization. Although it has been demonstrated that both HHV-6A and HHV-6B can infect glia and, more recently, cerebellar Purkinje cells, cell tropism of HHV-6A versus HHV-6B for different nerve cell types remains vague. In this study, we demonstrate that both HHV-6A and HHV-6B can infect different nerve cell types (i.e., glia versus neurons) and different neuronal neurotransmitter phenotypes derived from the differentiation of human neural stem cells. We further show that both HHV-6A and HHV-6B induce cytopathic effects (CPEs) in susceptible nerve cells. However, the time-course and severity of CPEs appear to differ between HHV-6A versus HHV-6B infections and are dependent upon multiplicity of infection (MOI). As demonstrated by immunofluorescence, although both the HHV-6A and HHV-6B viruses productively infected VGluT1-containing cells (i.e., glutamatergic neurons) and dopamine-containing cells (i.e., dopaminergic neurons), neither HHV-6A nor HHV-6B challenge resulted in the productive infection of GAD67-containing cells (i.e., GABAergic cells). The reason underlying the apparent resistance of GABAergic cells to HHV-6A and HHV-6B infection remains unclear. Morphometric and image analyses of neurite extension and retraction dynamics as well as the time-course of cell aggregation phenomena (e.g., syncytia formation) during infection also indicate that HHV-6A induces more severe CPEs than HHV-6B at the same time-point and MOI. These data suggest that HHV-6A is more virulent than HHV-6B on susceptible human neural stem cells (HNSCs) differentiated into neuronal phenotypes, while neither virus is able to infect GABAergic cells. If these in vitro data hold in vivo, the inhibitory interneuron dysfunction hypothesis for HHV6-driven seizures may be ruled out as a potential mechanism for HHV6-induced epileptogenesis.",

In contrast, the TMAO precursor trimethylamine (TMA) impaired BBB function and disrupted tight junction integrity. Moreover, we show that long-term exposure to TMAO protects murine cognitive function from inflammatory challenge, acting to limit astrocyte and microglial reactivity in a brain region-specific manner.\n\nConclusionOur findings demonstrate the mechanisms through which microbiome-associated methylamines directly interact with the mammalian BBB, with consequences for cerebrovascular and cognitive function.",

    "abstract": "European Apis mellifera and Asian Apis cerana honeybees, are essential crop pollinators. Microbiome studies can provide complex information on health and fitness of these insects in relation to environmental changes, and plant availability. Amplicon sequencing of variable regions of 16S rRNA and internally transcribed spacers (ITSs) allow identification of the metabiome. These methods provide a tool for monitoring otherwise uncultured microbes isolated from the gut of the honeybees. They also help monitor the composition of the gut fungi and, intriguingly, pollens collected by the insect. Here, we present data from amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA and ITS2 regions from honeybees collected at various time points from anthropogenic landforms as urban areas in Poland, UK, Spain, Greece, and Thailand. We have analysed microbial composition of honeybee intestine as well as fungi and pollens. We conclude that differences between samples were mainly influenced by the bacteria, plant pollens and fungi, respectively. Moreover, honeybees feeding on a honeydew diet, mainly based on sugars, were more prone to fungal pathogens (Nosema ceranae) and neogregarines. Finally, the period when honeybees switch to the winter generation (longer-lived forager honeybees) is the most sensitive to diet perturbations and hence pathogens attack, for the whole beekeeping season. It is possible that evolutionary adaptation of bees fails to benefit them in the modern anthropomorphised environment.",

    "abstract": "Human brain organoids replicate much of the cellular diversity and developmental anatomy of the human brain. However, the physiological behavior of neuronal circuits within organoids remains relatively under-explored. With high-density CMOS microelectrode arrays (26,400 electrodes) and shank electrodes (960 electrodes), we probed broadband and three-dimensional extracellular field recordings generated by spontaneous activity of human brain organoids. These recordings simultaneously captured local field potentials (LFPs) and single-unit activity extracted through spike sorting. From spiking activity, we estimated a directed functional connectivity graph of synchronous neural network activity, which showed a large number of weak functional connections enmeshed within a network skeleton of significantly fewer strong connections. Treatment of the organoid with a benzodiazepine induced a reproducible signature response that shortened the inter-burst intervals, increased the uniformity of the firing pattern within each burst and decreased the population of weakly connected edges. Simultaneously examining the spontaneous LFPs and their phase alignment to spiking showed that spike bursts were coherent with theta oscillations in the LFPs. Our results demonstrate that human brain organoids have self-organized neuronal assemblies of sufficient size, cellular orientation, and functional connectivity to co-activate and generate field potentials from their collective transmembrane currents that phase-lock to spiking activity. These results point to the potential of brain organoids for the study of neuropsychiatric diseases, drug mechanisms, and the effects of external stimuli upon neuronal networks.",

    "abstract": "Insects can navigate efficiently in both novel and familiar environments, and this requires flexiblity in how they are guided by sensory cues. A prominent landmark, for example, can ellicit strong innate behaviours (attraction or menotaxis) but can also be used, after learning, as a specific directional cue as part of a navigation memory. However, the mechanisms that allow both pathways to co-exist, interact or override each other are largely unknown. Here we propose a model for the behavioural integration of innate and learned guidance based on the neuroanatomy of the central complex (CX), adapted to control landmark guided behaviours. We consider a reward signal provided either by an innate attraction to landmarks or a long-term visual memory in the mushroom bodies (MB) that modulates the formation of a local vector memory in the CX. Using an operant strategy for a simulated agent exploring a simple world containing a single visual cue, we show how the generated short-term memory can support both innate and learned steering behaviour. In addition, we show how this architecture is consistent with the observed effects of unilateral MB lesions in ants that cause a reversion to innate behaviour. We suggest the formation of a directional memory in the CX can be interpreted as transforming rewarding (positive or negative) sensory signals into a mapping of the environment that describes the geometrical attractiveness (or repulsion). We discuss how this scheme might represent an ideal way to combine multisensory information gathered during the exploration of an environment and support optimized cue integration.\n\n1 Author summaryIn this paper, we modeled the neural pathway allowing insects to perform landmark guided behaviours using their internal compass. First, we observed the intrinsic property of the connectome, extracted from drosophila online database, between the internal compass neurons and the steering neurons to support an oriented behaviour towards a single landmark. Then, we proposed and evaluated an adaptation of the bees path integration neural circuit, to sustain flexible landmark guidance behaviours such as attraction or menotaxis. We showed the model ability to form a memory during the exploration of the local environment to support both innate or learned navigation behaviour using a single landmark in the environment. In addtion, we demonstrated the transformation of a simple goodness/badness signal, from innate or long-term memory pathways, into an oriented steering signal that could be applied to other sensory pathways. Furthermore, by reproducing lesion experiments in the mushroom bodies of wood ants we highlight the consistency of the model with biological observation. We then discuss the different emergent properties and the potential outcome that this local, and operant, memory supports.",

PPI network analysis, GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis of the key targets were investigated using String and David databases. A total of 33 components and 116 corresponding targets were screened. Amongst them, the key active compounds in rhubarb included emodin, aloe emodin, {beta}-sitosterol, emodin methyl ether and rhein, which were predicted to target TP53, AKT1, STAT3, PIK3CA, HRAS, and VEGFA. GO analysis revealed that the cellular targets clustered into 159 biological processes, including those involved in cellular composition (n=24) and molecular functions (n=42, P<0.01). KEGG pathway analysis revealed 85 (P < 0.01) pathways related to cancer. The active compounds in rhubarb target TP53, AKT1 and PIK3CA.

    "abstract": "The study aimed to estimate the disease burden of East Coast fever (ECF) among rural cattle keeping households of Namwala District of Zambia using Productivity Adjusted Life Years (PALYs). We modified Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) equations for humans to PALYs to estimate the societal burden of animal diseases. We used a structured questionnaire to collect data on parameters that feed into PALY equations. We coded and entered data from questionnaires directly into Statistical Package of Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Version 20), and entered the estimated values of PALY parameters into Mathematical Calculus Software called Integral Calculator (https://www.integral-calculator.com/). We then used the integral calculator to calculate PALY equations, which we used to estimate the societal disease burden of ECF in cattle. PALYs calculations were done in three categories; PALYs without discounting and age weighting, PALYs with only discounting, and PALYs with discounting and age weighting.\n\nResults revealed that the years of productivity lost by a cow, bull, and ox that suffered from ECF were estimated at 15, 10, and 15 years, respectively. In the second category, the years of productivity lost by a cow, bull, and ox were seven, six, and seven years, respectively. In the final category, the years of productivity lost by a cow, bull, and ox were five years.\n\nECF caused a total of 517,165 PALYs in Namwala District. The quality of life reduced in years due to disability (YLD) caused by ECF per cow, bull, and ox was 0.07, 0.07, and 0.02 percent of their life expectancy, respectively. The estimated values for the years of a lifetime lost due to mortality (YLL) caused by ECF were 35, 49, and 35 percent of the life expectancy per cow, bull, and ox. These results are important for measuring outcomes of animal health problems in terms of PALYs. The findings are helpful in future projections for the future burden of any disease and can be used as a basis in policy-making and decision-making, particularly on priorities in animal health research. We recommend that a classification of animal diseases of national economic importance should consider both the societal burden and economic impact instead of the common practice of only considering the economic impact.",

    "abstract": "Statistical learning (SL) is the ability to extract regularities from the environment. In the domain of language, this ability is fundamental in the learning of words and structural rules. In lack of reliable online measures, statistical word and rule learning have been primarily investigated using offline (post-familiarization) tests, which gives limited insights into the dynamics of SL and its neural basis. Here, we capitalize on a novel task that tracks the online statistical learning of language rules combined with computational modelling to show that online SL responds to reinforcement learning principles rooted in striatal function. Specifically, we demonstrate - on two different cohorts - that a Temporal Difference model, which relies on prediction errors, accounts for participants online learning behavior. We then show that the trial-by-trial development of predictions through learning strongly correlates with activity in both ventral and dorsal striatum. Our results thus provide a detailed mechanistic account of language-related SL and an explanation for the oft-cited implication of the striatum in SL tasks. This work, therefore, bridges the longstanding gap between language learning and reinforcement learning phenomena.",

Cerebroventricular infusion of GABAAR mAbs and Fab fragments into rodents induced a severe phenotype with catatonia, seizures and increased mortality, reminiscent of encephalitis patients symptoms. Our results prove direct functional effects of autoantibodies on GABAARs and provide an animal model for GABAAR encephalitis.

    "abstract": "Compromised endocytosis in neurons leads to synapse overgrowth and altered organization of synaptic proteins. However, the molecular players and the signaling pathways which regulate the process remains poorly understood. Here we show that {sigma}2-adaptin, one of the subunits of the AP2-complex, genetically interacts with BMP type I receptor, Thickveins (Tkv), and Daughter against decapentaplegic (Dad), two of the components of BMP signaling. We found that mutations in {sigma}2-adaptin lead to an accumulation of Tkv receptors at the NMJ and results in a significant reduction in Tkv-positive early endosomes in the presynaptic terminals. Interestingly, the level of small GTPase Rab11 was significantly reduced in the {sigma}2-adaptin mutant synapses. Consistent with the role of {sigma}2-adaptin and Rab11 in the regulation of the same signaling pathway, a mutation in Rab11 or overexpression of a GDP-locked form of Rab11 (Rab11S25N) phenocopies the morphological and signaling defects of the {sigma}2-adaptin mutants. Finally, we demonstrate that{sigma} 2-adaptin mutants show an accumulation of large vesicles and massive membranous structures, akin to endosomes at the synapse. Thus, we propose a model in which AP2 regulates Tkv internalization and recycling through a process that requires Rab11 activity to control the synaptic growth.",

    "abstract": "The Red Sea is a unique environment for corals with a strong environmental gradient characterized by temperature extremes and high salinities, but minimal terrestrial runoff or riverine input and their associated pollution. Disease surveys were conducted along 22 reefs in the central Red Sea along the Saudi Arabian coast in October 2015, which coincided with a bleaching event. Our objectives were to 1) document types, prevalence, and distribution of coral diseases in a region with minimal terrestrial input, 2) compare regional differences in diseases and bleaching along a latitudinal gradient of environmental conditions, and 3) use histopathology to characterize disease lesions at the cellular level. Coral reefs of the central Red Sea had a widespread but a surprisingly low prevalence of disease (<0.5%), based on the examination of >75,750 colonies. Twenty diseases were recorded affecting 16 coral taxa and included black band disease, white syndromes, endolithic hypermycosis, skeletal eroding band, growth anomalies and focal bleached patches. The three most common diseases were Acropora white syndrome (59.1% of the survey sites), Porites growth anomalies (40.9%), and Porites white syndrome (31.8%). Over half of the coral genera within transects had lesions and corals from the genera Acropora, Millepora and Lobophyllia were the most commonly affected. Cell-associated microbial aggregates were found in four coral genera resembling patterns found in the Indo-Pacific. Differences in disease prevalence, coral cover, amount of heat stress as measured by degree heating weeks (DHW) and extent of bleaching was evident among sites. Disease prevalence was not explained by coral cover or DHW, and a negative relationship between coral bleaching and disease prevalence was found. The northern-most sites off the coast of Yanbu had the highest average DHW values but absence of bleaching and the highest average disease prevalence was recorded. Our study provides a foundation and baseline data for coral disease prevalence in the Red Sea, which is projected to increase as a consequence of increased frequency and severity of ocean warming.",

    "abstract": "All songbirds have one special accessory chromosome1-4, the so-called germline-restricted chromosome (GRC)4-7, which is only present in germline cells and absent from all somatic tissues. Earlier work on the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata castanotis) showed that the GRC is inherited only through the female line4,6,8,9 - like mitochondrial DNA7,9-12 - and is eliminated from the sperm during spermatogenesis5,7,9-11. Here we show that the GRC can also be paternally inherited. Confocal microscopy using GRC-specific FISH probes indicated that a considerable fraction of sperm heads (1-19%) in zebra finch ejaculates still contained the GRC. In line with these cytogenetic data, sequencing of ejaculates revealed that individual males from two families differed strongly and consistently in the number of GRCs in their ejaculates. Examining a captive-bred population of hybrids of the two zebra finch subspecies (T. g. guttata and T. g. castanotis) revealed that the descendants inherited their mitochondria from a castanotis mother but their GRC from a guttata father. Moreover, GRC haplotypes across nine different castanotis matrilines showed at best a weak tendency to be co-inherited with mtDNA haplotypes. Within castanotis, the GRC showed little variability, while the mtDNA of matrilines was highly divergent. This suggests that a single GRC haplotype has recently spread across the entire castanotis population, crossing the matriline boundaries via paternal spillover. Our findings raise the possibility that certain GRC haplotypes could selfishly spread through the population, via additional paternal transmission, thereby outcompeting other GRC haplotypes that were limited to strict maternal inheritance, even if this was partly detrimental to organismal fitness.",

Because insecticides and anthelmintics are discovered in phenotypic screens, a crucial step in the discovery process is determining the mode of action of hits. Visible whole-organism symptoms are combined with molecular and physiological data to determine mode of action. However, manual symptomology is laborious and requires symptoms that are strong enough to see by eye. Here we use high-throughput imaging and quantitative phenotyping to measure C. elegans behavioral responses to compounds and train a classifier that predicts mode of action with an accuracy of 88% for a set of ten common modes of action. We also classify compounds within each mode of action to discover pharmacological relationships that are not captured in broad mode of action labels.

Machine learning (ML) promises to considerably improve the analysis of the resulting data, however, there is yet to be any tool that mediates the path from raw data to modern ML applications. More specifically, ML applications are currently hampered by three major limitations: (1) absence of balanced training data with large sample size; (2) unclear definition of sufficiently information-rich data representations for e.g. peptide identification; (3) lack of benchmarking of ML methods on specific LC-MS problems.\n\nResultsWe created the MS2AI pipeline that automates the process of gathering vast quantities of mass spectrometry (MS) data for large scale ML applications. The software retrieves raw data from either in-house sources or from the proteomics identifications database, PRIDE. Subsequently, the raw data is stored in a standardized format amenable for ML encompassing MS1/MS2 spectra and peptide identifications.

Heterogeneous subpopulations of PCs have been identified that display differences in intrinsic firing properties without clear mechanistic insight into what underlies the divergence in firing parameters. Although long used as a general PC marker, we report that the calcium binding protein parvalbumin labels a subpopulation of PCs with a conserved distribution pattern across the animals examined. We trained a convolutional neural network to recognize the parvalbumin-positive subtype and create maps of whole cerebellar distribution and find that PCs within these areas have differences in spontaneous firing that can be modified by altering calcium buffer content. These subtypes also show differential responses to potassium and calcium channel blockade, suggesting a mechanistic role for variability in PC intrinsic firing through differences in ion channel composition. It is proposed that ion channels drive the diversity in PC intrinsic firing phenotype and parvalbumin calcium buffering provides capacity for the highest firing rates observed. These findings open new avenues for detailed classification of PC subtypes.",

In contrast to prior findings, differential learning impairments were restricted to fear acquisition, and not observed in the reversal stage of the experiment. As previous and present fear reversal experiments in OCD differed in the use of color coding to facilitate stimulus discrimination, the studies converge to suggest that differential learning of threatening versus safe stimuli is impaired in OCD, but manifests itself differently depending on the difficulty of the association to be learned. When supported by the addition of color, patients with OCD previously appeared to acquire an association early but failed to reverse it according to changed contingencies. In absence of such color coding of stimuli, our data suggest that patients with OCD already show differential learning impairments during fear acquisition, which may relate to findings of altered coping with uncertainty previously observed in OCD. Impaired differential learning of threatening versus safe stimuli should be studied further in OCD, in order to determine whether impairments in differential learning predict CBT treatment outcomes in patients, and whether they are etiologically relevant for OCD.",

    "abstract": "Many crop species, particularly those of tropical origin, are chilling sensitive so improved chilling tolerance can enhance production of these crops in temperate regions. For the cereal crop sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) early planting and chilling tolerance have been investigated for >50 years, but the potential value or tradeoffs of this genotype x management change has not been formally evaluated with modeling. To assess the potential of early-planted chilling-tolerant grain sorghum in the central US sorghum belt, we conducted CERES-Sorghum simulations and characterized scenarios under which this change would be expected to enhance (or diminish) drought escape, water capture, and yield. We conducted crop growth modeling for full- and short-season hybrids under rainfed systems that were simulated to be planted in very early (April), early (May 15), and normal (June 15) planting dates over 1986-2015 in four locations in Kansas representative of the central US sorghum belt. Simulations indicated that very early planting will generally lead to lower initial soil moisture, longer growing periods, and higher evapotranspiration. Very early planting is expected to extend the growing period by 20% for short- or full-season hybrids, reduce evaporation during fallow periods, and increase plant transpiration in the two-thirds of years with the highest precipitation (mean > 428 mm), leading to 11% and 7% increase grain yield for short- and full-season hybrids, respectively. Thus, in this major sorghum growing region very early and early planting could reduce risks of terminal droughts, extend seasons, and increase rotation options, suggesting that further development of chilling tolerant hybrids is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) increases the incidence of cutaneous melanoma1-4. The ageing, sun-exposed dermis accumulates UVR damage5, and older patients develop more melanomas at UVR-exposed sites4,6,7. As fibroblasts are functionally heterogeneous and play key roles in the stromal contribution to cancer8,9, we asked whether UVR modifies dermal fibroblast function. Here we confirmed the expression of collagen-cleaving matrix metalloprotein-1 (MMP1) by UVR-damaged fibroblasts was persistently upregulated to reduce local levels of collagen 1 (COL1A1), and found dermal COL1A1 degradation by MMP1 decreased melanoma invasion. Conversely, we show inhibiting extracellular matrix degradation and MMP1 expression restored melanoma invasion to UVR damaged dermis. We confirmed in vitro findings in a cohort of primary cutaneous melanomas of aged humans, showing more cancer cells invade as single cells at the invasive front of melanomas expressing and depositing more collagen. We found collagen and single melanoma cell invasion are robust predictors of poor melanoma-specific survival. These data indicate melanomas arising over UVR-damaged, collagen-poor skin of the elderly are less invasive, and this reduced invasion improves survival. Consequently, although UVR increases tumour incidence, it delays primary melanoma invasion by degrading collagen. However, we show melanoma-associated fibroblasts can restore invasion in low-collagen primary tumours by increasing collagen synthesis. Finally, we demonstrate high COL1A1 gene expression is a biomarker of poor outcome across a broad range of primary cancers.",

    "abstract": "The gibberellic acid-stimulated Arabidopsis (GASA/GAST) gene family is widely distributed in plants. The role of the GASA gene family has been reported previously in various physiological and biological processes, such as cell division, root and seed development, stem growth, and fruit ripening. These genes also provide resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses including antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal. Here, we report 17 tcGASA genes in Theobroma cacao L. distributed on six chromosomes. The gene structure, promoter-region sequences, protein structure, and biochemical properties, expression, and phylogenetics of all tcGASAs were analyzed. Phylogenetic analyses divided tcGASA proteins into five groups. The nine segmentally duplicating genes form four pairs and cluster together in phylogenetic tree. Purifying selection pressure was recorded on tcGASA, including duplicated genes. Several stress/hormone-responsive cis-regulatory elements were also recognized in the promoter region of tcGASAs. Differential expression analyses revealed that most of the tcGASA genes showed elevated expression in the seeds (cacao food), implying their role in seed development. The black rod disease of genus Phytophthora caused up to 20-25% loss (700,000 metric tons) in world cacao production. The role of tcGASA genes in conferring fungal resistance was also explored based on RNAseq data against Phytophthora megakarya. The differential expression of tcGASA genes was recorded between the tolerant and susceptible cultivars of cacao plants, which were inoculated with the fungus for 24h and 72h. This differential expression indicating possible role of tcGASA genes to fungal resistant in cacao. Our findings provide new insight into the function, evolution, and regulatory system of the GASA family genes in T. cacao and provide new target genes for development of fungi-resistant cacao varieties in breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) measured from blood specimens is a minimally invasive marker of mitochondrial function that exhibits both inter-individual and intercellular variation. To identify genes involved in regulating mitochondrial function, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 465,809 White individuals from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium and the UK Biobank (UKB). We identified 133 SNPs with statistically significant, independent effects associated with mtDNA-CN across 100 loci. A combination of fine-mapping, variant annotation, and co-localization analyses were used to prioritize genes within each of the 133 independent sites. Putative causal genes were enriched for known mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes (p = 3.09 x 10-15) and the gene ontology (GO) terms for mtDNA metabolism (p = 1.43 x 10-8) and mtDNA replication (p = 1.2 x 10-7). A clustering approach leveraged pleiotropy between mtDNA-CN associated SNPs and 41 mtDNA-CN associated phenotypes to identify functional domains, revealing three distinct groups, including platelet activation, megakaryocyte proliferation, and mtDNA metabolism. Finally, using mitochondrial SNPs, we establish causal relationships between mitochondrial function and a variety of blood cell related traits, kidney function, liver function and overall (p = 0.044) and non-cancer mortality (p = 6.56 x 10-4).",

    "abstract": "MotivationStructural genomic variants account for much of human variability and are involved in several diseases. Structural variants are complex and may affect coding regions of multiple genes, or affect the functions of genomic regions in different ways from single nucleotide variants. Interpreting the phenotypic consequences of structural variants relies on information about gene functions, haploinsufficiency or triplosensitivity, and other genomic features. Phenotype-based methods to identifying variants that are involved in genetic diseases combine molecular features with prior knowledge about the phenotypic consequences of altering gene functions. While phenotype-based methods have been applied successfully to single nucleotide variants as well as short insertions and deletions, the complexity of structural variants makes it more challenging to link them to phenotypes. Furthermore, structural variants can affect a large number of coding regions, and phenotype information may not be available for all of them.\n\nResultsWe developed DeepSVP, a computational method to prioritize structural variants involved in genetic diseases by combining genomic and gene functions information. We incorporate phenotypes linked to genes, functions of gene products, gene expression in individual celltypes, and anatomical sites of expression, and systematically relate them to their phenotypic consequences through ontologies and machine learning. DeepSVP significantly improves the success rate of finding causative variants in several benchmarks and can identify novel pathogenic structural variants in consanguineous families.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/DeepSVP\n\nContactrobert.hoehndorf@kaust.edu.sa",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein mediates virus entry and is a major target for neutralizing antibodies. All current vaccines are based on the ancestral Spike with the goal of generating a protective neutralizing antibody response. Several novel SARS-CoV-2 variants with multiple Spike mutations have emerged, and their rapid spread and potential for immune escape have raised concerns. One of these variants, first identified in the United Kingdom, B.1.1.7 (also called VUI202012/01), contains eight Spike mutations with potential to impact antibody therapy, vaccine efficacy and risk of reinfection. Here we employed a lentivirus-based pseudovirus assay to show that variant B.1.1.7 remains sensitive to neutralization, albeit at moderately reduced levels (~2-fold), by serum samples from convalescent individuals and recipients of two different vaccines based on ancestral Spike: mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and protein nanoparticle NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax). Some monoclonal antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike were less effective against the variant while others were largely unaffected. These findings indicate that B.1.1.7 is not a neutralization escape variant that would be a major concern for current vaccines, or for an increased risk of reinfection.",

    "abstract": "The cellular prion protein PrPC is necessary for prion replication, and its reduction greatly increases life expectancy in animal models of prion infection. Hence the factors controlling the levels of PrPC may represent therapeutic targets against human prion diseases. Here we performed an arrayed whole-transcriptome RNA interference screen to identify modulators of PrPC expression. We cultured human U251-MG glioblastoma cells in the presence of 64752 unique siRNAs targeting 21584 annotated human genes, and measured PrPC using a one-pot fluorescence-resonance energy transfer immunoassay in 51128 individual microplate wells. This screen yielded 743 candidate regulators of PrPC. When downregulated, 563 of these candidates reduced and 180 enhanced PrPC expression. Recursive candidate attrition through multiple secondary screens yielded 54 novel regulators of PrPC, 9 of which were confirmed by CRISPR interference as robust regulators of PrPC biosynthesis and degradation. The phenotypes of 6 of the 9 candidates were inverted in response to transcriptional activation using CRISPRa. The RNA-binding post-transcriptional repressor Pumilio-1 was identified as a potent limiter of PrPC expression through the degradation of PRNP mRNA. Because of its hypothesis-free design, this comprehensive genetic-perturbation screen delivers an unbiased landscape of the genes regulating PrPC levels in cells, most of which were unanticipated, and some of which may be amenable to pharmacological targeting in the context of antiprion therapies.",
