    "abstract": "The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a membrane-anchored tyrosine kinase that is able to selectively respond to multiple extra-cellular stimuli. Previous studies have indicated that the modularity of this system is affected by ligand-induced differences in the stability of the dimerized receptor in a process known as \"Biased signaling\". However, this hypothesis has not been explored using single-mutant ligands thus far. Herein, we developed a new approach to identify residues responsible for functional divergence combining the conservation and co-evolution information of ortholog and paralog genes encoding the epidermal growth factor (EGF) ligand. Then, we mutated these residues and assessed the mutants effects on the receptor by employing a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) and biochemical techniques. Although the EGF mutants had comparable binding affinities to the wild type ligand for EGFR, the EGF mutants induced a different phosphorylation and cell growth pattern in multiple cell lines. The MD simulations of the EGF mutants show a long-range effect on the receptor dimer interface. For the first time in this study, a single mutation in EGF is shown to be enough to alter the activation of the pathway at the cellular level. These results also support the theory of biased signaling in the tyrosine kinase receptor system and demonstrate a promising new way to study ligand-receptor interactions.",

    "abstract": "Computational prediction of Protein-Ligand Interaction (PLI) is an important step in the modern drug discovery pipeline as it mitigates the cost, time, and resources required to screen novel therapeutics. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have recently shown excellent performance in PLI prediction. However, the performance is highly dependent on protein and ligand features utilized for the DNN model. Moreover, in current models, the deciphering of how protein features determine the underlying principles that govern PLI is not trivial. In this work, we developed a DNN framework named SSnet that utilizes secondary structure information of proteins extracted as the curvature and torsion of the protein backbone to predict PLI. We demonstrate the performance of SSnet by comparing against a variety of currently popular machine and non-machine learning models using various metrics. We visualize the intermediate layers of SSnet to show a potential latent space for proteins, in particular to extract structural elements in a protein that the model finds influential for ligand binding, which is one of the key features of SSnet. We observed in our study that SSnet learns information about locations in a protein where a ligand can bind including binding sites, allosteric sites and cryptic sites, regardless of the conformation used. We further observed that SSnet is not biased to any specific molecular interaction and extracts the protein fold information critical for PLI prediction. Our work forms an important gateway to the general exploration of secondary structure based deep learning, which is not just confined to protein-ligand interactions, and as such will have a large impact on protein research while being readily accessible for de novo drug designers as a standalone package.",

We describe here a unique human cell-free transcription system that recapitulates RNA pol II pausing and assemble paused pol IIs on the human CMV IE, SV40, and heat shock promoters, all is the case in vivo. We then use the system to show that PARP-1 and CDK12/13 inhibitors directly affect pausing and elongation. We then show that O-GlcNAcylation is required for the establishment of a paused pol II: inhibition of OGT allowed pol II to bypass pausing and begin to elongate. Addback of rOGT or the pausing factor NELF re-established the pausing. In vivo nascent RNA measurements showed that OGA inhibition blocks elongation. These data show that cell-free systems can recapitulate RNA pol II pausing, that PARP-1 and CDK12/13 directly regulate RNA pol II elongation, and identify O-GlcNAc cycling regulating both pausing and pause release.",

    "abstract": "Optimality models have a checkered history in evolutionary biology. While optimality models have been successful in providing valuable insight into the evolution of a wide variety of biological traits, a common objection is that optimality models are overly simplistic and ignore organismal genetics. We revisit evolutionary optimization in the context of a major bacteriophage life history trait, lysis time. Lysis time refers to the period spanning phage infection of a host cell and its lysis, whereupon phage progeny are released. Lysis time, therefore, directly determines phage fecundity assuming progeny assembly rate is maximized. Noting that previous tests of lysis time optimality rely on batch culture, we implemented a quasi-continuous culture system to observe productivity of a panel of isogenic phage {lambda} mutants differing in lysis time. We report that {lambda} phage productivity in our experiments is maximized around an optimal lysis time of 63 min, which is the lysis time of the {lambda} \"wildtype\" strain. We discuss this finding in light of recent results that lysis time variation is also minimized in the {lambda} \"wildtype\" strain.",

Using lineage tracing, we demonstrate that SMA identifies long-term, slow-cycling, self-renewing osteochondroprogenitors in the adult periosteum that are functionally important for bone formation during fracture healing. In addition, Col2.3CreER-labeled osteoblast cells contribute around 10% of osteoblasts, but no chondrocytes in fracture calluses. Most periosteal osteochondroprogenitors following fracture, can be targeted by SMACreER. Previously identified skeletal stem cell populations were common in periosteum, but contained high proportions of mature osteoblasts.

We measured slow learning using spontaneous recovery, the return to learned adaptation after brief wash out of fast adaptation. Spontaneous recovery increased in both groups only in overlearning. A model of adaptation suggested that in controls the increase reflects changes in slow system dynamics. In contrast, because cerebellar participants plateaued more slowly than controls, added trials in models of cerebellar participants increased the level of slow learning. Whereas, under the model, slow learning became more resilient in controls, there was no change in its dynamics for cerebellar participants. Our results and modeling suggest that while residual slow learning does exist in cerebellar patients and can be expressed through increased training trials, the primary cerebellar deficit cannot be improved by overlearning paradigms.",

    "abstract": "Successful execution of behavior requires coordinated activity and communication between multiple cell types. Studies using the relatively simple neural circuits of invertebrates have helped to uncover how conserved molecular and cellular signaling events shape animal behavior. To understand the mechanisms underlying neural circuit activity and behavior, we have been studying a simple circuit that drives egg-laying behavior in the nematode worm C. elegans. Here we show that the sex-specific, Ventral C (VC) motor neurons are important for vulval muscle contractility and egg laying in response to serotonin. Ca2+ imaging experiments show the VCs are active during times of vulval muscle contraction and vulval opening, and optogenetic stimulation of the VCs promotes vulval muscle Ca2+ activity. Blocking VC neurotransmission inhibits egg laying in response to serotonin and increases the failure rate of egg-laying attempts, indicating that VC signaling facilitates full vulval muscle contraction and opening of the vulva for efficient egg laying. We also find the VCs are mechanically activated in response to vulval opening. Optogenetic stimulation of the vulval muscles is sufficient to drive VC Ca2+ activity and requires muscle contractility, showing the presynaptic VCs and the postsynaptic vulval muscles can mutually excite each other. Together, our results demonstrate that the VC neurons facilitate efficient execution of egg-laying behavior by coordinating postsynaptic muscle contractility in response to serotonin and mechanosensory feedback.\n\nSignificance StatementMany animal motor behaviors are modulated by the neurotransmitters serotonin and acetylcholine. Such motor circuits also respond to mechanosensory feedback, but how neurotransmitters and mechanoreceptors work together to coordinate behavior is not well understood. We address these questions using the egg-laying circuit in C. elegans where we can manipulate presynaptic neuron and postsynaptic muscle activity in behaving animals while recording circuit responses through Ca2+ imaging. We find that the cholinergic VC motoneurons are important for proper vulval muscle contractility and egg laying in response to serotonin. Muscle contraction also activates the VCs, forming a positive feedback loop that promotes full contraction for egg release. In all, mechanosensory feedback provides a parallel form of modulation that shapes circuit responses to neurotransmitters.",

    "abstract": "The size of the mammalian cerebrum spans more than 5 orders of magnitude. The smallest cerebrums have a smooth (lissencephalic) cortical surface, which gets increasingly folded (gyrencephalic) with cerebral size. Further, the proportion of white-to-gray matter volume increases with the total volume. These scaling relations have unusually little variation. Even though a number of theories and models have been proposed, it remains an open question, why this is so. Here, we show that almost all variance is explained by assuming a homogeneous composition of the cortex across mammals. On the basis of this assumption we derive quantitative analytical computational models. The first model predicts the cortical surface area from the gray and white matter volume. A single free parameter, for the height of cortical columns is estimated as{lambda} = 2.9 mm (r2 = 0.996). The second model predicts the white matter volume as a function of the gray volume and the cerebral size (with parameters for intra- and extra-gyral connections lint, lext; [Formula]). The models are validated by predicting the effective cortical thickness and the folding parameter{kappa} . The results accurately predict the human intraspecific variation of the surface relations. As expected, we find a reduced{lambda} for cetaceans, and that preterm human infants do not follow the model. We also find deviations of gray and white matter volume for large cerebrums. Overall, the models thus show how the regular architecture of the cortex shapes the cerebrum. We conclude that the mammalian cerebrum scales in an isomorphic, rather than isometric, manner.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection successfully explains how organisms accumulate adaptive change despite that traits acquired over a lifetime are eliminated at the end of each generation. However, in some domains that exhibit cumulative, adaptive change--e.g., cultural evolution, and earliest life--acquired traits are retained; these domains do not face the problem that Darwins theory was designed to solve. Lack of transmission of acquired traits occurs when germ cells are protected from environmental change, due to a self-assembly code used in two distinct ways: (i) actively interpreted during development to generate a soma, and (ii) passively copied without interpretation during reproduction to generate germ cells. Early life and cultural evolution appear not to involve a self-assembly code used in these two ways. We suggest that cumulative, adaptive change in these domains is due to a lower-fidelity evolutionary process, and model it using Reflexively Autocatalytic and Foodset-generated networks. We refer to this more primitive evolutionary process as Self-Other Reorganisation (SOR) because it involves internal self-organising and self-maintaining processes within entities, as well as interaction between entities. SOR encompasses learning but in general operates across groups. We discuss the relationship between SOR and Lamarckism, and illustrate a special case of SOR without variation.",

Leaves exposed to temperature extremes have inhibited photosynthesis and will accumulate damage to photosystem II (PSII) if tolerance thresholds are exceeded. Temperature-dependent changes in basal chlorophyll fluorescence (T-F0) can be used to identify the critical temperature at which PSII is inhibited. We developed and tested a high-throughput method for measuring the critical temperatures for PSII at low (CTMIN) and high (CTMAX) temperatures using a Maxi-Imaging fluorimeter and a thermoelectric Peltier plate heating/cooling system. We examined how experimental conditions: wet vs dry surfaces for leaves and heating/cooling rate, affect CTMIN and CTMAX across four species. CTMAX estimates were not different whether measured on wet or dry surfaces, but leaves were apparently less cold tolerant when on wet surfaces. Heating/cooling rate had a strong effect on both CTMAX and CTMIN that was species-specific. We discuss potential mechanisms for these results and recommend settings for researchers to use when measuring T-F0. The approach that we demonstrated here allows the high-throughput measurement of a valuable ecophysiological parameter that estimates the critical temperature thresholds of leaf photosynthetic performance in response to thermal extremes.",

    "abstract": "A musicians spontaneous rate of movement, called spontaneous motor tempo (SMT), can be measured while spontaneously playing a simple melody. Data shows that the SMT influences the musicians tempo and synchronization. In this study we present a model that captures these phenomena. We review the results from three previously-published studies: (1) solo musical performance with a pacing metronome tempo that is different from the SMT, (2) solo musical performance without a metronome at a tempo that is faster or slower than the SMT, and (3) duet musical performance between musicians with matching or mismatching SMTs. These studies showed, respectively, that (1) the asynchrony between the pacing metronome and the musicians tempo grew as a function of the difference between the metronome tempo and the musicians SMT, (2) musicians drifted away from the initial tempo toward the SMT, and (3) the absolute asynchronies were smaller if musicians had matching SMTs. We hypothesize that the SMT constantly acts as a pulling force affecting musical actions at a tempo different from a musicians SMT. To test our hypothesis, we developed a model consisting of a non-linear oscillator with Hebbian tempo learning and a pulling force to the models spontaneous frequency. While the models spontaneous frequency emulates the SMT, elastic Hebbian learning allows for frequency learning to match a stimulus frequency. To test our hypothesis, we first fit model parameters to match the data published in (1) and asked whether this same model would explain the data in (2) and (3) without further tuning. Results showed that the models dynamics allowed it to explain all three experiments with the same set of parameters. Our theory offers a dynamical-systems explanation of how an individuals SMT affects synchronization in realistic music performance settings, and the model also enables predictions about performance settings not yet tested.\n\nAuthor summaryIndividuals can keep a musical tempo on their own or timed by another individual or a metronome. Experiments show that individuals show a specific spontaneous rate of periodic action, for example walking, blinking, or singing. Moreover, in a simple metronome synchronization task, an individuals spontaneous rate determines that the individual will tend to anticipate a metronome that is slower, and lag a metronome that is faster. Researchers have hypothesized the mechanisms explaining how spontaneous rates affect synchronization, but no hypothesis can account for all observations yet. Our hypothesis is that individuals rely on adaptive frequency learning during synchronization tasks to adapt the rate of their movements and match another individuals actions or metronome tempo. Adaptive frequency learning also explains why an individuals spontaneous rate persists after carrying out a musical synchronization task. We define a new model with adaptive frequency learning and use it to simulate existing empirical data. Not only can our model explain the empirical data, but it can also make testable predictions. Our results support the theory that the brains endogenous rhythms give rise to spontaneous rates of movement, and that learning dynamics interact with such brain rhythms to allow for flexible synchronization.",

    "abstract": "Blast-induced hearing difficulties affect thousands of veterans and civilians. The long-term impact of even a mild blast exposure on the central auditory system is hypothesized to contribute to lasting behavioral complaints associated with mild blast traumatic brain injury (bTBI). Although recovery from mild blast has been studied separately over brief or long time windows, few, if any, studies have investigated recovery longitudinally over short-term and longer-term (months) time windows. Specifically, many peripheral measures of auditory function either recover or exhibit subclinical deficits, masking deficits in processing complex, real-world stimuli that may recover differently. Thus, examining the acute time course and pattern of neurophysiological impairment using appropriate stimuli is critical to better understanding and intervention of bTBI-induced auditory system impairments. Here, we compared auditory brainstem response, middle-latency auditory evoked potentials, and envelope following responses. Stimuli were clicks, tone pips, amplitude modulated tones in quiet and in noise, and speech-like stimuli (iterated rippled noise pitch contours) in adult male rats subjected to mild blast and sham exposure over the course of two months. We found that blast animals demonstrated drastic threshold increases and auditory transmission deficits immediately after blast exposure, followed by substantial recovery during the window of 7-14 days post-blast, though with some deficits remaining even after two months. Challenging conditions and speech-like stimuli can better elucidate mild bTBI-induced auditory deficit during this period. Our results suggest multiphasic recovery and therefore potentially different time windows for treatment, and deficits can be best observed using a small battery of sound stimuli.\n\nNew and NoteworthyFew studies on blast-induced hearing deficits go beyond simple sounds and sparsely track post-exposure. Therefore, the recovery arc for potential therapies and real-world listening is poorly understood. Evidence suggested multiple recovery phases over 2 months post-exposure. Hearing thresholds largely recovered within 14 days and partially explained recovery. However, mid-latency responses, responses to AM in noise, and speech-like pitch sweeps exhibited extended changes, implying persistent central auditory deficits and the importance of subclinical threshold shifts.",

    "abstract": "The shift from sexual reproduction to parthenogenesis has occurred repeatedly in animals, but how the loss of sex affects genome evolution remains poorly understood. We generated de novo reference genomes for five independently evolved parthenogenetic species in the stick insect genus Timema and their closest sexual relatives. Using these references in combination with population genomic data, we show that parthenogenesis results in an extreme reduction of heterozygosity, and often leads to genetically uniform populations. We also find evidence for less effective positive selection in parthenogenetic species, supporting the view that sex is ubiquitous in natural populations because it facilitates fast rates of adaptation. Contrary to studies of non-recombining genome portions in sexual species, genomes of parthenogenetic species do not accumulate transposable elements (TEs), likely because successful parthenogens derive from sexual ancestors with inactive TEs. Because we are able to conduct replicated comparisons across five species pairs, our study reveals, for the first time, how animal genomes evolve in the absence of sex in natural populations, providing empirical support for the negative consequences of parthenogenetic reproduction as predicted by theory.",

    "abstract": "The dense Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) coat of African trypanosomes represents the primary host-pathogen interface. Antigenic variation prevents clearing of the pathogen by employing a large repertoire of antigenically distinct VSG genes, thus neutralizing the hosts antibody response. To explore the epitope space of VSGs, we generated anti-VSG nanobodies and combined high-resolution structural analysis of VSG-nanobody complexes with binding assays on living cells, revealing that these camelid antibodies bind deeply inside the coat. One nanobody caused rapid loss of cellular motility, possibly due to blockage of VSG mobility on the coat, whose rapid endo-and exocytosis is mechanistically linked to T. brucei propulsion and whose density is required for survival. Electron microscopy studies demonstrated that this loss of motility was accompanied by rapid formation and shedding of nanovesicles and nanotubes, suggesting that increased protein crowding on the dense membrane can be a driving force for membrane fission in living cells.",

    "abstract": "Spatially resolved transcriptomic technologies are promising tools to study cell fate decisions in a physical microenvironment, which is fundamental for enhancing our knowledge of mammalian development. However, the imbalance between resolution, transcript capture and field of view of current methodologies precludes their systematic application to analyze relatively large and three-dimensional mid- and late-gestation mammalian embryos. Here, we combined DNA nanoball (DNB) patterned arrays and tissue RNA capture to create SpaTial Enhanced REsolution Omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq). This approach allows transcriptomic profiling of large histological sections with high resolution and sensitivity. We have applied Stereo-seq to study the kinetics and directionality of transcriptional variation in a time course of mouse organogenesis. We used this information to gain insight into the molecular basis of regional specification, neuronal migration and differentiation in the developing brain. Furthermore, we mapped the expression of a panel of developmental disease-related loci on our global transcriptomic maps to define the spatiotemporal windows of tissue vulnerability. Our panoramic atlas constitutes an essential resource to investigate longstanding questions concerning normal and abnormal mammalian development.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes Johnes disease (or paratuberculosis), a chronic wasting disease of ruminants and other animals resulting from granulomatous enteritis. There are increasing concerns that MAP is zoonotic. The prevalence of Johnes disease is increasing worldwide. In an attempt to control an epidemic of ovine Johnes disease (OJD) in New South Wales (NSW), a government/industry sponsored voluntary vaccination/on-farm management program commenced in 2000. We report herein an observational study of changes in disease prevalence as vaccination progressed, based on abattoir surveillance data for OJD from 1999 to 2009. We also discuss the epidemiological, policy, regulatory, research, economic and sociological elements that contributed to the development of a mature control program, whose aim was to halt the epidemic spread of OJD in a naive sheep population.\n\nMethodsNSW was divided into areas of \"High\" (HPA), \"Medium\" (MPA) and \"Low\" (LPA) OJD prevalence. A killed whole cell vaccine (Gudair(R)) was administered to sheep from 2000 to 2009. Trained examiners evaluated the viscera of adult sheep carcasses at slaughter for gross evidence of OJD. MAP infection was confirmed by histopathology.\n\nPrincipal findingsFrom 2000-2009, 12 million vaccine doses were administered in NSW (91%; 10.9 million in the HPA). Many of the vaccinated flocks were suffering > 5% annual mortality in adult sheep, with some individual flocks with 10-15% losses attributable to OJD. A total of 7.6 million carcasses were examined (38%; 2.9 million from the HPA). Overall, 16% of slaughter consignments (sheep consigned to the abattoir from a single vendor) were positive for OJD, of which 94% were from the HPA. In the HPA, the percentage of animals with lesions attributable to OJD at slaughter fell progressively from 2.4% (10,406/432,860) at commencement of vaccination in 2000 to 0.8% (1,573/189,564) by 2009. Herd immunity from vaccination in the HPA was estimated at 70% by 2009. This coincided with a progressive decrease in reports of clinical disease and mortalities in vaccinated flocks.\n\nSignificanceWe show a decrease in the prevalence of lesions attributable to OJD in NSW concomitant with initiation of voluntary vaccination, on-farm management plans, abattoir monitoring and feedback of animal prevalence data to sheep producers. We conclude that a target of [&le;] 1% regional prevalence of OJD affected sheep at slaughter is achievable using these interventions.",

As evidenced by the numerous defects associated with aberrant DNA methylation landscapes, establishing proper tissue-specific methylation patterns is critical. Yet, how such differences arise remains a largely open question in both plants and animals. Here we demonstrate that CLASSY1-4 (CLSY1-4), four locus-specific regulators of DNA methylation that are differentially expressed during plant development, play major roles in controlling tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns. Depending on the tissue, the genetic requirements for specific CLSYs differ significantly and, on a global scale, certain clsy mutants are sufficient to largely shift the epigenetic landscape between tissues. Together, these findings not only reveal substantial epigenetic diversity between tissues, but assign these changes to specific CLSY proteins, revealing how locus-specific targeting combined with tissue-specific expression enables the CLSYs to generate epigenetic diversity during plant development.",

    "abstract": "SUMO conjugates and SUMO chains form when SUMO, a small ubiquitin-like modifier protein, is covalently linked to other cellular proteins or itself. During unperturbed growth, cells maintain balanced levels of SUMO conjugates. In contrast, eukaryotic cells that are exposed to proteotoxic and genotoxic insults mount a cytoprotective SUMO-Stress Response (SSR). One hallmark of the SSR is a rapid and massive increase of SUMO conjugates in response to oxidative, thermal, and osmotic stress. Here, we use a recombinant fluorescent SUMO biosensor, KmUTAG-fl, to investigate differences in the SSR in a normal human prostate epithelial cell line immortalized with SV40 (PNT2) and two human prostate cancer cell lines that differ in aggressiveness and response to androgen (LNCaP and PC3). In cells that grow unperturbed, SUMO is enriched in the nuclei of all three cell lines. However, upon 30 minutes of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV) or oxidative stress, we detected significant cytosolic enrichment of SUMO as measured by KmUTAG-fl staining. This rapid enrichment in cytosolic SUMO levels was on average 5-fold higher in the LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines compared to normal immortalized PNT2 cells. Additionally, this enhanced enrichment of cytosolic SUMO was reversible as cells recovered from stress exposure. Our study validates the use of the fluorescent KmUTAG-fl SUMO biosensor to detect differences of SUMO levels and localization between normal and cancer cells and provides new evidence that cancer cells may exhibit an enhanced SSR.",

They have generally not been amenable to conventional structure-based drug design, however, because their intrinsic conformational variability has precluded an atomic-level understanding of their binding to small molecules. Here we present long-timescale, atomic-level molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of monomeric -synuclein (an IDP whose aggregation is associated with Parkinsons disease) binding the small-molecule drug fasudil in which the observed protein-ligand interactions were found to be in good agreement with previously reported NMR chemical shift data. In our simulations, fasudil, when bound, favored certain charge-charge and {pi}-stacking interactions near the C terminus of -synuclein, but tended not to form these interactions simultaneously, rather breaking one of these interactions and forming another nearby (a mechanism we term dynamic shuttling). Further simulations with small molecules chosen to modify these interactions yielded binding affinities and key structural features of binding consistent with subsequent NMR experiments, suggesting the potential for MD-based strategies to facilitate the rational design of small molecules that bind with disordered proteins.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSensorimotor gating is a fundamental neural filtering process that allows attention to be focused on a given stimulus. Sensory gating, commonly measured using the prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the auditory startle reflex task, is impaired in patients suffering from various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. Because PPI deficits are often associated with attention and cognitive impairments, they are widely used as biomarkers in pre-clinical research for anti-psychotic drug screening. Yet, the neurotransmitter systems and synaptic mechanisms underlying PPI are still not resolved, even under physiological conditions. Recent evidence ruled out the longstanding hypothesis that PPI is mediated by midbrain cholinergic inputs to the caudal pontine reticular nucleus (PnC). Instead, glutamatergic, glycinergic and GABAergic inhibitory mechanisms are now suggested to be crucial for PPI, at the PnC level. Since amygdalar dysfunctions affect PPI and are common to pathologies displaying sensorimotor gating deficits, the present study was designed to test that direct projections to the PnC originating from the amygdala, contribute to PPI.\n\nResultsUsing Wild Type and transgenic mice expressing eGFP under the control of the glycine transporter type 2 promoter (GlyT2-eGFP mice), we first employed tract-tracing, morphological reconstructions and immunohistochemical analyses to demonstrate that the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) sends glutamatergic inputs latero-ventrally to PnC neurons, including GlyT2+ cells. Then, we showed the contribution of the CeA-PnC excitatory synapses to PPI in vivo by demonstrating that optogenetic inhibition of this connection decreases PPI, and optogenetic activation induces partial PPI. Finally, in GlyT2-Cre mice, whole-cell recordings of GlyT2+ PnC neurons in vitro paired with optogenetic stimulation of CeA fibers, as well as photo-inhibition of GlyT2+ PnC neurons in vivo, allowed us to implicate GlyT2+ neurons in the PPI pathway.\n\nConclusionsOur results uncover a feed-forward inhibitory mechanism within the brainstem startle circuit by which amygdalar glutamatergic inputs and GlyT2+ PnC neurons play a key role in meditating PPI. We are providing new insights to the clinically-relevant theoretical construct of PPI, which is disrupted in various neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental diseases.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila tracheal system, as the functional equivalent of mammalian blood vessels, responds to hypoxia and transports oxygen throughout the body. Although the signaling pathways involved in tracheal development and the hypoxic response are well-studied, how adult tracheae interact with their target tissues is largely unknown. Here we show that the tracheae that serve the adult intestine are dynamic and respond to enteric infection, oxidative agents, and the development of gut tumors with increased terminal branching. Increased tracheation is necessary for efficient damage-induced intestinal stem cell (ISC)-mediated midgut regeneration and sufficient to drive ISC proliferation in the absence of damage. Gut damage or tumors induce Hif-1/Sima, which, in turn, stimulates tracheole branching via the FGF(Brachless/Bnl)/FGFR(Breathless/Btl) signaling cascade. Bnl/Btl signaling is required both in the intestinal epithelium and the tracheal system for efficient damage-induced tracheal remodeling and ISC proliferation. We show that chemical or Pseudomonas-generated ROS directly affect the trachea and are necessary for branching and intestinal regeneration. Similarly, tracheole branching and the resulting increase in oxygen supply are essential for tumor growth in the midgut. Thus, we have identified a novel mechanism of visceral tracheal-intestinal tissue communication, whereby oxidative damage and tumors induce neo-tracheogenesis in adult Drosophila. This process is reminiscent of cancer-induced neo-angiogenesis in mammals.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is caused by a newly identified coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and has become a pandemic around the world. The illustration of the immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed for understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and its vaccine development. CD8+ T cells are critical for virus clearance and induce long lasting protection in the host. Here we identified specific HLA-A2 restricted T cell epitopes in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Seven epitope peptides (n-Sp1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14) were confirmed to bind with HLA-A2 and potentially be presented by antigen presenting cells to induce host immune responses. Tetramers containing these peptides could interact with specific CD8+ T cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients, and one dominant epitope (n-Sp1) was defined. In addition, these epitopes could activate and generate epitope-specific T cells in vitro, and those activated T cells showed cytotoxicity to target cells. Meanwhile, all these epitopes exhibited high frequency of variations. Among them, n-Sp1 epitope variation 5L>F significantly decreased the proportion of specific T cell activation; n-Sp1 epitope 8L>V variant showed significantly reduced binding to HLA-A2 and decreased the proportion of n-Sp1-specific CD8+ T cell, which potentially contributes to the immune escape of SAR-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 exploits angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to invade cells. It has been reported that the UK and South African strains may have higher transmission capabilities, eventually due to amino acid substitutions on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The pathogenicity seems modified but is still under investigation. Here we used the experimental structure of the Spike RBD domain co-crystallized with part of the ACE2 receptor and several in silico methods to analyze the possible impacts of three amino acid replacements (Spike K417N, E484K, N501Y) with regard to ACE2 binding. We found that the N501Y replacement in this region of the interface (present in both UK and South African strains) should be favorable for the interaction with ACE2 while the K417N and E484K substitutions (South African) would seem unfavorable. It is unclear if the N501Y substitution in the South African strain could counterbalance the predicted less favorable (regarding binding) K417N and E484K Spike replacements. Our finding suggests that, if indeed the South African strain has a high transmission level, this could be due to the N501Y replacement and/or to substitutions in regions outside the direct Spike-ACE2 interface.\n\nHihglightsO_LITransmission of the UK and possibly South African SARS-CoV-2 strains appears substantially increased compared to other variants\nC_LIO_LIThis could be due, in part, to increased affinity between the variant Spike proteins and ACE2\nC_LIO_LIWe investigated in silico the 3D structure of the Spike-ACE2 complex with a focus on Spike K417N, E484K and N501Y\nC_LIO_LIThe N501Y substitution is predicted to increase the affinity toward ACE2 (UK strain) with subsequent enhanced transmissibility and possibly pathogenicity\nC_LIO_LIAdditional substitutions at positions 417 and 484 (South African strain) may pertub the interaction with ACE2 raising questions about transmissibility and pathogenicity\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 is a new emerging coronavirus initially reported in China at the late December 2019 and rapidly spread to the whole of the world. To date, 1261903 total case and 55830 deaths are reported from Iran as 8 January. In this study, we investigated all the complete sequences of SARS-CoV-2 that publicly reported from Iran. Twenty-four sequences between March to September 2020 were analyzed to identify genome variations and phylogenetic relationships. Furthermore, we assessed the amino acid changes related to the spike glycoprotein as an important viral factor associated with the entry to the host cells and as a vaccine target. Most of the variations are occurred in the ORF1ab, S, N, intergenic and ORF7 regions. The analysis of spike protein mutations demonstrated that D614G mutation could be detected from the May and beyond. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the circulated viruses in Iran are belong to the B.4 lineage. Although, we found a limited number of variants associated to the B.1 lineage carrying D614G mutation. Furthermore, we detected a variant characterize as the B.1.36 lineage with sixteen mutations in the spike protein region. This study showed the frequency of the viral populations in Iran as September, therefore, there is an emergent need to genomic surveillance to track viral lineage shift in the country beyond the September. These data would help to predict future situation and apply better strategy to control of the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "A number of single-cell RNA studies looking at the human immune response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been recently published. However, the number of samples used in each individual study typically is small, moreover the technologies and protocols used in different studies vary, thus somewhat restricting the range of conclusions that can be made with high confidence. To better capture the cellular gene expression changes upon SARS-CoV-2 infection at different levels and stages of disease severity and to minimise the effect of technical artefacts, we performed meta-analysis of data from 9 previously published studies, together comprising 143 human samples, and a set of 16 healthy control samples (10X). In particular, we used generally accepted immune cell markers to discern specific cell subtypes and to look at the changes of the cell proportion over different disease stages and their consistency across the studies. While half of the observations reported in the individual studies can be confirmed across multiple studies, half of the results seem to be less conclusive. In particular, we show that the differentially expressed genes consistently point to upregulation of type I Interferon signal pathway and downregulation of the mitochondrial genes, alongside several other reproducibly consistent changes. We also confirm the presence of expanded B-cell clones in COVID-19 patients, however, no consistent trend in T-cell clonal expansion was observed.",

    "abstract": "To date, existing animal models of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have failed to translate preclinical discoveries into effective pharmacotherapy or diagnostic biomarkers. To address this translational gap, we developed a high-fidelity swine model of ARDS utilizing clinically-relevant lung injury exposures. Fourteen male swine were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and surgically instrumented for hemodynamic monitoring, blood, and tissue sampling. Animals were allocated to one of three groups: 1) Indirect lung injury only: animals were inoculated by direct injection of E. coli into the kidney parenchyma, provoking systemic inflammation and distributive shock physiology; 2) Direct lung injury only: animals received volutrauma, hyperoxia, and bronchoscope-delivered gastric particles; 3) Combined indirect and direct lung injury: animals were administered both above-described indirect and direct lung injury exposures. Animals were monitored for up to 12 hours, with serial collection of physiologic data, blood samples, and radiographic imaging. Lung tissue was acquired post-mortem for pathological examination. In contrast to indirect lung injury only and direct lung injury only groups, animals in the combined indirect and direct lung injury group exhibited all of the physiological, radiographic, and histopathologic hallmarks of human ARDS: impaired gas exchange (mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio 124.8 {+/-} 63.8), diffuse bilateral opacities on chest radiographs, and extensive pathologic evidence of diffuse alveolar damage. Our novel porcine model of ARDS, built on clinically-relevant lung injury exposures, faithfully recapitulates the physiologic, radiographic, and histopathologic features of human ARDS, and fills a crucial gap in the translational study of human lung injury.",

    "abstract": "Sour has been studied almost exclusively as an aversive taste modality. Yet, recent work in Drosophila demonstrates that specific carboxylic acids are attractive at ecologically relevant concentrations. Here, we demonstrate that lactic acid is an appetitive and energetic tastant, which stimulates feeding through activation of sweet gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs). This activation displays distinct, mechanistically separable, stimulus onset and removal phases. Ionotropic receptor 25a (IR25a) primarily mediates the onset response, which shows specificity for the lactate anion and drives feeding initiation. Conversely, sweet gustatory receptors (Gr64a-f) mediate a non-specific removal response to low pH that primarily impacts ingestion. While mutations in either receptor family have marginal impacts on feeding, lactic acid attraction is completely abolished in combined mutants. Thus, specific components of lactic acid are detected through two classes of receptors to activate a single set of sensory neurons in physiologically distinct ways, ultimately leading to robust behavioural attraction.",

    "abstract": "The ability to measure changes in neuronal activity in a quantifiable and precise manner is of fundamental importance to understand neuron development and function. Repeated monitoring of neuronal activity of the same population of neurons over several days is challenging and, typically, low-throughput. Here, we describe a new biochemical reporter assay that allows for repeated measurements of neuronal activity in a cell type-specific manner. We coupled activity-dependent elements from the Arc/Arg3.1 gene with a secreted reporter, Gaussia luciferase, to quantify neuronal activity without sacrificing the neurons. The reporter predominantly senses calcium and NMDA receptor-dependent activity. By repeatedly measuring the accumulation of the reporter in cell media, we can profile the developmental dynamics of neuronal activity in cultured neurons from male and female mice. The assay also allows for longitudinal analysis of pharmacological treatments, thus distinguishing acute from delayed responses. Moreover, conditional expression of the reporter allows for monitoring cell type-specific changes. This simple, quantitative, cost-effective, automatable, and cell type-specific activity reporter is a valuable tool to study the development of neuronal activity in normal and disease-model conditions, and to identify small molecules or protein factors that selectively modulate the activity of a specific population of neurons.\n\nSignificanceNeurological and neurodevelopmental disorders are prevalent worldwide. Despite significant advances in our understanding of synapse formation and function, developing effective therapeutics remains challenging, in part due to the lack of simple and robust high-throughput screening assays of neuronal activity. Here, we describe a simple biochemical assay that allows for repeated measurements of neuronal activity in a cell type-specific manner. Thus filling the need for assays amenable to longitudinal studies, such as those related to neural development. Other advantages include its simple and quantitative nature, logitudinal profiling, cell type-specificity, and being multiplexed with other invasive techniques.",

    "abstract": "The resting brain consumes enormous energy and shows highly organized spontaneous activity. To investigate how this activity is manifest among single neurons, we analyzed spiking discharges of [~]10,000 isolated cells recorded from multiple cortical and subcortical regions of the mouse brain during immobile rest. We found that firing of a significant proportion ([~]70%) of neurons conformed to a ubiquitous, temporally sequenced cascade of spiking that was synchronized with global events and elapsed over timescales of 5-10 seconds. Across the brain, two intermixed populations of neurons supported orthogonal cascades. The relative phases of these cascades determined, at each moment, the response magnitude evoked by an external visual stimulus. Furthermore, the spiking of individual neurons embedded in these cascades was time locked to physiological indicators of arousal, including local field potential (LFP) power, pupil diameter, and hippocampal ripples. These findings demonstrate that the large-scale coordination of low-frequency spontaneous activity, which is commonly observed in brain imaging and linked to arousal, sensory processing, and memory, is underpinned by sequential, large-scale temporal cascades of neuronal spiking across the brain.",

    "abstract": "The pupil provides a rich, non-invasive measure of the neural bases of perception and cognition, and has been of particular value in uncovering the role of arousal-linked neuromodulation, which alters cortical processing as well as pupil size. But pupil size is subject to a multitude of influences, which complicates unique interpretation. We measured pupils of observers experiencing perceptual multistability -- an ever-changing subjective percept in the face of unchanging but inconclusive sensory input. In separate conditions the endogenously generated perceptual changes were either task-relevant or not, allowing a separation between perception-related and task-related pupil signals. Perceptual changes were marked by a complex pupil response that could be decomposed into two components: a dilation tied to task execution and plausibly indicative of an arousal-linked noradrenaline surge, and an overlapping constriction tied to the perceptual transient and plausibly a marker of altered visual cortical representation. Constriction, but not dilation, amplitude systematically depended on the time interval between perceptual changes, possibly providing an overt index of neural adaptation. These results show that the pupil provides a simultaneous reading on interacting but dissociable neural processes during perceptual multistability, and suggest that arousal-linked neuromodulation shapes action but not perception in these circumstances.",

    "abstract": "So far, our understanding on the role of the auditory cortex (ACX) in processing visual information has been limited to infragranular layers of the ACX, which have been shown to respond to visual stimulation. Here, we investigate the neurons in supragranular layers of the mouse ACX using 2-photon calcium imaging. Contrary to previous reports, here we show that more than 20% of responding neurons in layer2/3 of the ACX respond to full-field visual stimulation. These responses occur by both excitation and hyperpolarization. The primary ACX (A1) has a greater proportion of visual responses by hyperpolarization compared to excitation likely driven by inhibitory neurons of the infragranular layers of the ACX rather than local layer 2/3 inhibitory neurons. Further, we found that more than 60% of neurons in the layer 2/3 of A1 are multisensory in nature. We also show the presence of multisensory neurons in close proximity to exclusive auditory neurons and that there is a reduction in the noise correlations of the recorded neurons during multisensory presentation. This is evidence in favour of deep and intricate visual influence over auditory processing. The results have strong implications for decoding visual influences over the early auditory cortical regions.\n\nSignificance statementTo understand, what features of our visual world are processed in the auditory cortex (ACX), understanding response properties of auditory cortical neurons to visual stimuli is important. Here, we show the presence of visual and multisensory responses in the supragranular layers of the ACX. Hyperpolarization to visual stimulation is more commonly observed in the primary ACX. Multisensory stimulation results in suppression of responses compared to unisensory stimulation and an overall decrease in noise correlation in the primary ACX. The close-knit architecture of these neurons with auditory specific neurons suggests the influence of non-auditory stimuli on the auditory processing.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is accompanied by a myriad of both transient and long-lasting autoimmune responses. Dermatan sulfate (DS), a glycosaminoglycan crucial for wound healing, has unique affinity for autoantigens (autoAgs) from apoptotic cells. DS-autoAg complexes are capable of stimulating autoreactive B cells and autoantibody production. Using DS affinity, we identified an autoantigenome of 408 proteins from human fetal lung fibroblast HFL11 cells, at least 231 of which are known autoAgs. Comparing with available COVID data, 352 proteins of the autoantigenome have thus far been found to be altered at protein or RNA levels in SARS-Cov-2 infection, 210 of which are known autoAgs. The COVID-altered proteins are significantly associated with RNA metabolism, translation, vesicles and vesicle transport, cell death, supramolecular fibrils, cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix, and interleukin signaling. They offer clues to neurological problems, fibrosis, smooth muscle dysfunction, and thrombosis. In particular, 150 altered proteins are related to the nervous system, including axon, myelin sheath, neuron projection, neuronal cell body, and olfactory bulb. An association with the melanosome is also identified. The findings from our study illustrate a strong connection between viral infection and autoimmunity. The vast number of COVID-altered proteins with propensity to become autoAgs offers an explanation for the diverse autoimmune complications in COVID patients. The variety of autoAgs related to mRNA metabolism, translation, and vesicles raises concerns about potential adverse effects of mRNA vaccines. The COVID autoantigen atlas we are establishing provides a detailed molecular map for further investigation of autoimmune sequelae of the pandemic.\n\nSummary sentenceAn autoantigenome by dermatan sulfate affinity from human lung HFL1 cells may explain neurological and autoimmune manifestations of COVID-19",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in millions of deaths worldwide and massive societal and economic burden. Recently, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, known as B.1.1.7, was first detected in the United Kingdom and is spreading in several other countries, heightening public health concern and raising questions as to the resulting effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutic interventions. We and others previously identified host-directed therapies with antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Less prone to the development of therapy resistance, host-directed drugs represent promising therapeutic options to combat emerging viral variants as host genes possess a lower propensity to mutate compared to viral genes. Here, in the first study of the full-length B.1.1.7 variant virus, we find two host-directed drugs, plitidepsin (aplidin; inhibits translation elongation factor eEF1A) and ralimetinib (inhibits p38 MAP kinase cascade), as well as remdesivir, to possess similar antiviral activity against both the early-lineage SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.1.7 variant, evaluated in both human gastrointestinal and lung epithelial cell lines. We find that plitidepsin is over an order of magnitude more potent than remdesivir against both viruses. These results highlight the importance of continued development of host-directed therapeutics to combat current and future coronavirus variant outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "The ability to assay large numbers of low-abundance mutations is crucial in biomedicine. Yet, the technical hurdles of sequencing multiple mutations at extremely high depth and accuracy remain daunting. For sequencing low-level mutations, its either  depth or breadth but not both. Here, we report a simple and powerful approach to accurately track thousands of distinct mutations with minimal reads. Our technique called MAESTRO (minor allele enriched sequencing through recognition oligonucleotides) employs massively-parallel mutation enrichment to empower duplex sequencing--one of the most accurate methods--to track up to 10,000 low-frequency mutations with up to 100-fold less sequencing. In example use cases, we show that MAESTRO could enable mutation validation from cancer genome sequencing studies. We also show that it could track thousands of mutations from a patients tumor in cell-free DNA, which may improve detection of minimal residual disease from liquid biopsies. In all, MAESTRO improves the breadth, depth, accuracy, and efficiency of mutation testing.",

    "abstract": "In a context of climate change, identifying the genes underlying adaptations to extreme environments is essential. Small ruminants are adapted to a wide variety of habitats and thus, are promising study models. Here, we considered 17 goat and 25 sheep local Mediterranean breeds, in Italy, France and Spain. We proposed, and empirically tested a new methodology to highlight selection signatures in relation to the environments. Based on historical archives, we selected the breeds potentially most linked to a territory and defined their original geographical cradle, including transhumant pastoral areas. For both species, the cradles were arranged along latitudinal gradient of aridity and altitude. Then we used the programs PCAdapt and LFMM. Considering cradles, instead of current GPS coordinates, markedly improved the sensitivity of the LFMM analyses. All the results combined with a systematic literature review, revealed a set of genes with potentially key adaptive roles. Some of these genes, have been found implicated in lipid metabolism (SUCLG2, BMP2), hypoxia/heat stress (UBE2R2/UBAP2), lung function (BMPR2), seasonal patterns (SOX2, DPH6) or neuronal function (TRPC4, TRPC6). For the intergenic region between PCDH9 and KLH1, as well as NBEA, identified in both species, the adaptive role could be strong. We found for RXFP2, associated with sheep horn development, and MSRB3 and SLC26A4, both associated with hearing of sheep, a strong association with the environment gradient. We conclude that our new methodology, which considers breeds in their historical, environmental and anthropological context, provides novel and essential information on local breeds and their unique adaptations.",

    "abstract": "Conformation capture-approaches like Hi-C can elucidate chromosome structure at a genome-wide scale. Hi-C datasets are large and require specialised software. Here, we present GENOVA: a user-friendly software package to analyse and visualise conformation capture data. GENOVA is an R-package that includes the most common Hi-C analyses, such as compartment and insulation score analysis. It can create annotated heatmaps to visualise the contact frequency at a specific locus and aggregate Hi-C signal over user-specified genomic regions such as ChIP-seq data. Finally, our package supports output from the major mapping-pipelines. We demonstrate the capabilities of GENOVA by analysing Hi-C data from HAP1 cell lines in which the cohesin-subunits SA1 and SA2 were knocked out. We find that {Delta}SA1 cells gain intra-TAD interactions and increase compartmentalisation. {Delta}SA2 cells have longer loops and a less compartmentalised genome. These results suggest that cohesinSA1 forms longer loops, while cohesinSA2 plays a role in forming and maintaining intra-TAD interactions. Our data supports the model that the genome is provided structure in 3D by the counter-balancing of loop formation on one hand, and compartmentalization on the other hand. By differentially controlling loops, cohesinSA1 and cohesinSA2 therefore also affect nuclear compartmentalization. We show that GENOVA is an easy to use R-package, that allows researchers to explore Hi-C data in great detail.",

However, genome-based insights into the transition from a phototroph into a secondary heterotroph have so far only been revealed for parasitic species. Free-living organisms can yield unique insights into the evolutionary consequence of the loss of photosynthesis, as the parasitic lifestyle requires specific adaptations to host environments. Here we report on the diploid genome of the free-living diatom Nitzschia putrida (35 Mbp), a non-photosynthetic osmotroph whose photosynthetic relatives contribute ca. 40% of net oceanic primary production. Comparative analyses with photosynthetic diatoms revealed that a combination of genes loss, the horizontal acquisition of genes involved in organic carbon degradation, a unique secretome and the rapid divergence of conserved gene families involved in cell wall and extracellular metabolism appear to have facilitated the lifestyle of a non-parasitic, free-living secondary heterotroph.",

    "abstract": "Placing new sequences onto reference phylogenies is increasingly used for analyzing environmental samples, especially microbiomes. However, existing placement methods have a fundamental limitation: they assume that query sequences have evolved using specific models directly on the reference phylogeny. Thus, they can place single-gene data (e.g., 16S rRNA amplicons) onto their own gene tree. This practice is a proxy for a more ambitious goal: extending a (genome-wide) species tree given data from individual genes. No algorithm currently addresses this challenging problem. Here, we introduce Deep-learning Enabled Phylogenetic Placement (DEPP), an algorithm that learns to extend species trees using single genes without pre-specified models. We show that DEPP updates the multi-locus microbial tree-of-life with single genes with high accuracy. We further demonstrate that DEPP can achieve the long-standing goal of combining 16S and metagenomic data onto a single tree, enabling community structure analyses that were previously impossible and producing robust patterns.",

Mcy protein, isolated from the fruits of Momordicacymbalaria, was shown to have antihyperglycemic, antihyperlipidemic activities along with renal as well as hepatoprotective activities in Streptozotocin induced diabetic rats.Mcy protein was shown to have insulin like and/or insulin secretagoguestructure and/or functions. Hence, the present study was conducted to elucidate molecular mechanism wherebyMcy protein elicits its therapeutic role and also to know whether the Mcyprotein has any structural and functional similarity with insulin. Results of our experiments revealed that the Mcyprotein is insulin like protein. Further, we assessed the effect of treatment of Mcy protein on the levels of glucose transport (glucose transporter (GLUT-2) and on the levels of key regulators of glucose and lipid metabolisms like hepatic glucokinase (GK) and sterol regulated element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). Our findings demonstrated that Mcy protein decreased the elevated expressions of GK, SREBP-1c and GLUT-2 that were observed in diabetic animals. Insulin-receptor binding studies using rat erythrocytes demonstrated that mean specific binding of insulin with insulin receptors was significantly increased in Mcy treated diabetic rats when compared to diabetic control rats. Scatchard analyses of insulin-binding studies yielded curvilinear plots, and the number of receptor sites per cell was found to be 180{+/-}21.1 in Mcy treated diabetic animals calculated to be significantly superior to that of diabetic control animals. Kinetic analyses also revealed an increase in the average receptor affinity of erythrocytes from Mcy treated rats compared to diabetic control rats suggesting acute alteration in the number and affinity of insulin receptors on the membranes of erythrocytes.",

    "abstract": "Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) tumors are heterogeneous mixtures of transcriptional subtypes. Understanding subtype dynamics could be key to explaining the aggressive properties that make SCLC a recalcitrant cancer. Applying archetype analysis and evolutionary theory to bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, we show that SCLC cells reside within a cell-state continuum rather than in discrete subtype clusters. Gene expression signatures and ontologies indicate each vertex of the continuum corresponds to a functional phenotype optimized for a cancer hallmark task: three neuroendocrine archetypes specialize in proliferation/survival, inflammation and immune evasion, and two non-neuroendocrine archetypes in angiogenesis and metabolic dysregulation. Single cells can trade-off between these defined tasks to increase fitness and survival. SCLC cells can easily transition from specialists that optimize a single task to generalists that fall within the continuum, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity may be a mechanism by which SCLC cells become recalcitrant to treatment and adaptable to diverse microenvironments. We show that plasticity is uncoupled from the phenotype of single cells using a novel RNA-velocity-based metric, suggesting both specialist and generalist cells have the capability of becoming destabilized and transitioning to other phenotypes. We use network simulations to identify transcription factors such as MYC that promote plasticity and resistance to treatment. Our analysis pipeline is suitable to elucidate the role of phenotypic plasticity in any cancer type, and positions SCLC as a prime candidate for treatments that target plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory systems must detect and discriminate an enormous diversity of chemicals in the environment. To contend with this challenge, diverse species have converged on a common strategy in which odorant identity is encoded through the combinatorial activation of large families of olfactory receptors (ORs), thus allowing a finite number of receptors to detect an almost infinite chemical world. Although most individual ORs are sensitive to a variety of odorants, the structural basis for such flexible chemical recognition remains unknown. Here, we combine cryo-electron microscopy with functional studies of receptor tuning to gain insight into the structural and mechanistic basis of promiscuous odorant recognition. We show that OR5 from the jumping bristletail, Machilis hrabei, assembles as a homo-tetrameric odorant-gated ion channel with broad chemical tuning. We elucidated the structure of OR5 in multiple gating states, alone and in complex with two of its agonists--the odorant eugenol and the insect repellent DEET. Both ligands bind to a common binding site located in the transmembrane region of each subunit, composed of a simple geometric arrangement of aromatic and hydrophobic residues. We reveal that binding is mediated by hydrophobic, non-directional interactions with residues distributed throughout the binding pocket, enabling the flexible recognition of structurally distinct odorants. Mutation of individual residues lining the binding pocket predictably altered OR5s sensitivity to eugenol and DEET and broadly reconfigured the receptors tuning, supporting a model in which diverse odorants share the same structural determinants for binding. Together, these studies provide structural insight into odorant detection, shedding light onto the molecular recognition mechanisms that ultimately endow the olfactory system with its immense discriminatory capacity.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which we successfully navigate the environment depends on our ability to continuously track our heading direction and speed. Angular head velocity (AHV) cells, which encode the speed and direction of head turns during navigation, are fundamental to this process, yet the mechanisms that determine their function remain unknown. By performing chronic single-unit recordings in the retrosplenial cortex (RSP) of the mouse and tracking the activity of individual AHV neurons between freely moving and head-restrained conditions, we find that vestibular inputs dominate AHV signalling. In addition, we discover that self-generated optic flow input onto these neurons increases the gain and signal-to-noise ratio of angular velocity coding during free exploration. Psychophysical experiments and neural decoding further reveal that vestibular-visual integration increases the perceptual accuracy of egocentric angular velocity and the fidelity of its representation by RSP ensembles. We propose that while AHV coding is dependent on vestibular input, it also uses vision to maximise navigation accuracy in nocturnal and diurnal environments.",

Our adapted classifier significantly outperformed the original adult classifier on samples of naturalistic free play EEG data recorded from 10 to 12-month-old infants, achieving agreement rates with the manual classification of over 75% across two validation studies (n=44, n=25). Additionally, we examined both classifiers ability to remove stereotyped ocular artifact from a basic visual processing ERP dataset, compared to manual ICA data cleaning. Here the new classifier performed on level with expert manual cleaning and was again significantly better than the adult classifier at removing artifact whilst retaining a greater amount of genuine neural signal, operationalised through comparing ERP activations in time and space. Our new system (iMARA) offers developmental EEG researchers a flexible tool for automatic identification and removal of artifactual ICA components.",

Clarifying this could help distinguish between theories of consciousness. Here, we investigate the association between markers of regionally specific (de)activation and the brains overall capacity for consciousness.\n\nWe recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to cortical electrical stimulation in 6 rats, and computed Perturbational Complexity Index state-transition (PCIST), which has been extensively validated as an index of the capacity for consciousness in humans. We also estimated the balance between activation and inhibition of specific cortical areas with the ratio between high and low frequency power (HF/LF) from spontaneous EEG activity at each electrode. We repeated these measurements during wakefulness, and under the influence of ketamine anaesthesia at two doses: the minimal dose needed to induce behavioural unresponsiveness and twice this dose.\n\nWe found that PCIST was only slightly reduced from wakefulness to light ketamine anaesthesia, but dropped significantly down with deeper anaesthesia. The high-dose effect was selectively associated with reduced HF/LF ratio in the posteromedial cortex, which strongly correlated with PCIST. Conversely, behavioural unresponsiveness induced by light ketamine anaesthesia, was associated with similar spectral changes in frontal, but not posterior cortical regions.\n\nThese findings seem to support the claim that the posteromedial cortex may play a primary role for the capacity for consciousness. Such region-specific associations between cortical activation and the overall capacity for consciousness must be accounted for by theories of consciousness.",

Recent research suggests that the parietal node has regions dedicated to different action classes including manipulation, interpersonal, skin-displacing, locomotion, and climbing. The goals of the current study consist of: 1) extending this work with new classes of actions that are communicative and specific to humans, 2) investigating how parietal cortex differs from the occipito-temporal and premotor cortex in representing action classes. Human subjects underwent fMRI scanning while observing three action classes: indirect communication, direct communication, and manipulation, plus two types of control stimuli, static controls which were static frames from the video clips, and dynamic controls consisting of temporally-scrambled optic flow information. Using univariate analysis, MVPA, and representational similarity analysis, our study presents several novel findings. First, we provide further evidence for the anatomical segregation in parietal cortex of different action classes: We have found a new region that is specific for representing human-specific indirect communicative actions in cytoarchitectonic parietal area PFt. Second, we found that the discriminability between action classes was higher in parietal cortex than the other two levels suggesting the coding of action identity information at this level. Finally, our results advocate the use of the control stimuli not just for univariate analysis of complex action videos but also when using multivariate techniques.",

    "abstract": "A self-cleaving ribozyme mapping to an intron of the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 3 (CPEB3) gene has been suggested to play a role in human episodic memory, but the underlying mechanisms mediating this effect are not known. The ribozymes self-scission half-life matches the time it takes an RNA polymerase to reach the immediate downstream exon, suggesting that the ribozyme-dependent intron cleavage is tuned to co-transcriptional splicing of the CPEB3 mRNA. Here we report that the murine ribozyme modulates its own host mRNA maturation in both cultured cortical neurons and the hippocampus. Inhibition of the ribozyme using an antisense oligonucleotide leads to increased CPEB3 protein expression, which enhances polyadenylation and translation of localized plasticity-related target mRNAs, and subsequently strengthens hippocampal-dependent long-term memory. These findings reveal a previously unknown role for self-cleaving ribozyme activity in regulating experience-induced co-transcriptional and local translational processes required for learning and memory.",

    "abstract": "While most productivity on the surface of the Earth today is fueled by oxygenic photosynthesis, during the early parts of Earth history it is thought that anoxygenic photosynthesis--using compounds like ferrous iron or sulfide as electron donors--drove most global carbon fixation. Anoxygenic photosynthesis is still performed by diverse bacteria in niche environments today. Of these, the Chlorobi (formerly green sulfur bacteria) are often interpreted as being particularly ancient and are frequently proposed to have fueled the biosphere early in Earth history before the rise of oxygenic photosynthesis. Here, we perform comparative genomic, phylogenetic, and molecular clock analyses to determine the antiquity of the Chlorobi and their characteristic phenotypes. We show that contrary to common assumptions, the Chlorobi clade is relatively young, with anoxygenic phototrophy, carbon fixation via the rTCA pathway, and iron oxidation all significantly postdating the rise of oxygen ~2.3 billion years ago. The Chlorobi therefore could not have fueled the Archean biosphere, but instead represent a relatively young radiation of organisms which likely acquired the capacity for anoxygenic photosynthesis and other traits via horizontal gene transfer sometime after the evolution of oxygenic Cyanobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic simulation programs are useful to study the evolution of crop populations in changing environments. These programs require to take into account some specific features characterizing farmers practices such as seed circulation or seed mixing. However such human-mediated evolutionary processes are different from the classical colonization or migration models used in most existing stochastic simulation programs for quantitative population genetics.\n\nTo fill this gap, CropMetaPop is an individual based forward-time simulation program for quantitative population genetics developed to represent a diversity of socially established rules underlying seed circulation between farmers. For instance, one farmer can give seeds to neighbours according to his stock and receive from them according to his needs. Crop-Metapop also takes into account other important evolutionary forces encountered in crop diversity management systems, such as different population sizes and selection modalities for different populations.\n\nCropMetaPop makes it possible to study the impacts of different crop biodiversity management strategies. For this purpose, it simulates the genetic evolution over time of several crop populations submitted to genetic drift and selection and linked by explicitly modeled seed circulation and mixtures.",

Here, we report a comprehensive map of 36,699 non-reference MEIs constructed from 5,675 genomes, comprising 2,998 Chinese samples ([~]26.2X, NyuWa) and 2,677 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project ([~]7.4X, 1KGP). We discovered that LINE-1 insertions were highly enriched at centromere regions, implying the role of chromosome context in retroelement insertion. After functional annotation, we estimated that MEIs are responsible for about 9.3% of all protein-truncating events per genome. Finally, we built a companion database named HMEID for public use. This resource represents the latest and largest genomewide study on MEIs and will have broad utility for exploration of human MEI findings.",

Using genome sequences from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Project, we calculated telomere content across 1,299 cancer cell lines. We find that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression correlates with telomere content in lung, central nervous system, and leukemia cell lines. Using CRISPR/Cas9 screening data, we show that lower telomeric content is associated with dependency of CST telomere maintenance components. Increased dependencies of shelterin members are associated with wild-type TP53 status. Investigating the epigenetic regulation of TERT, we find widespread allele-specific expression in promoter-wildtype contexts. TERT promoter-mutant cell lines exhibit hypomethylation at PRC2-repressed regions, suggesting a cooperative global epigenetic state in the reactivation of telomerase. By incorporating telomere content with genomic features across comprehensively characterized cell lines, we provide further insights into the role of telomere regulation in cancer immortality.",

    "abstract": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm caused by the acquisition of BCR-ABL1 fusion in a hematopoietic stem cell. We identified the ENOX2 gene as up-regulated in BCR-ABL1-expressing UT-7 cell lines through a transcriptome assay. The oncofoetal ENOX2 protein (Ecto-Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Oxidase Disulfide Thiol Exchanger 2) is expressed on the external plasma membrane surface of cancer cells and can be released in cancer patients serum. Considering these data, we studied ENOX2 expression in CML cell lines and patients using quantitative RT-PCR, western-blots, the ELISA method, and transcriptomic dataset reanalysis. We confirmed increased ENOX2 mRNA expression in the BCR-ABL1-expressing UT-7 cell line. Comparable results were obtained in CML patients at diagnosis. Western-blot analyses on UT-7 and TET-inducible Ba/F3 cell lines established the up-regulation of ENOX2 protein. BCR-ABL1 has been found to induce ENOX2 overexpression in a kinase-dependent manner. In a series of 41 patients with CML, ELISA assays showed a highly significant increase of ENOX2 protein levels in the plasma of patients with CML (p < 0.0001) as compared to controls (n=28). Transcriptomic dataset (GSE4170) reanalyzes have shown specific ENOX2 mRNA overexpression in the chronic phase of the disease. Bioinformatic analyses identified several genes whose mRNA expression was positively correlated to ENOX2. Some of them encode proteins involved in cellular functions compatible with the growth deregulation observed in CML. All in all, our results demonstrate for the first time the upregulation of a secreted Redox protein in a BCR-ABL1-dependent manner in CML. Our data suggest that ENOX2 (through its transcriptional program) plays a significant role in the BCR-ABL1 leukemogenesis. Further studies are required to clarify the relationship between BCR-ABL1 and ENOX2.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been practiced for thousands of years for treating human diseases. In comparison to modern medicine, one of the advantages of TCM is the principle of herb compatibility, known as TCM formulae. A TCM formula usually consists of multiple herbs to achieve the maximum treatment effects, where their interactions are believed to elicit the therapeutic effects. Despite being a fundamental component of TCM, the rationale of combining specific herb combinations remains unclear. In this study, we proposed a network-based method to quantify the interactions in herb pairs. We constructed a protein-protein interaction network for a given herb pair by retrieving the associated ingredients and protein targets, and determined multiple network-based distances including the closest, shortest, center, kernel, and separation, both at the ingredient and at the target levels. We found that the frequently used herb pairs tend to have shorter distances compared to random herb pairs, suggesting that a therapeutic herb pair is more likely to affect neighboring proteins in the human interactome. Furthermore, we found that the center distance determined at the ingredient level improves the discrimination of top-frequent herb pairs from random herb pairs, suggesting the rationale of considering the topologically important ingredients for inferring the mechanisms of action of TCM. Taken together, we have provided a network pharmacology framework to quantify the degree of herb interactions, which shall help explore the space of herb combinations more effectively to identify the synergistic compound interactions based on network topology.",

    "abstract": "Rostro-caudal coordination of spinal motor output is essential for locomotion. Most spinal interneurons project axons longitudinally to govern locomotor output, yet their connectivity along this axis remains unclear. In this study, we use larval zebrafish to map synaptic outputs of a major inhibitory population, V1 (Eng1+) neurons, which are implicated in dual sensory and motor functions. We find that V1 neurons exhibit long axons extending rostrally and exclusively ipsilaterally for an average of 6 spinal segments; however, they do not connect uniformly with their post-synaptic targets along the entire length of their axon. Locally, V1 neurons inhibit motor neurons (both fast and slow) and other premotor targets including V2a, V2b and commissural pre-motor neurons. In contrast, V1 neurons make robust inhibitory contacts throughout the rostral extent of their axonal projections onto a dorsal horn sensory population, the Commissural Primary Ascending neurons (CoPAs). In a computational model of the ipsilateral spinal network, we show that this pattern of short range V1 inhibition to motor and premotor neurons is crucial for coordinated rostro-caudal propagation of the locomotor wave. We conclude that spinal network architecture in the longitudinal axis can vary dramatically, with differentially targeted local and distal connections, yielding important consequences for function.",

    "abstract": "Our cognition can be directed to external stimuli or to internal information. While there are many different forms of internal cognition (mind-wandering, recall, imagery etc.), their essential feature is independence from the immediate sensory input. This is thought to be reflected in the decoupling of brain networks from the external stimuli, but a quantitative investigation of this remains outstanding. Here we present a conceptual and analysis framework that links stimulus responses to connectivity between brain networks. This allows us to quantify the coupling of brain networks to the external stimuli. We tested this framework by presenting subjects with an audiovisual stimulus and instructing them to either attend to the stimulus (external task) or engage in mental imagery, recall or arithmetic (internal tasks) while measuring the evoked brain activity using functional MRI. We found that stimulus responses were generally attenuated for the internal tasks, though they increased in a subset of tasks and brain networks. However, using our new measure of coupling, we showed that brain networks became increasingly decoupled from the stimulus, even in the subset of tasks and brain networks in which stimulus responses increased. These results quantitatively demonstrate that during internal cognition brain networks are decoupled from external stimuli, opening the door for a fundamental and quantitative understanding of internal cognition.",

We evaluate the utility of REM in two case studies for the predictive tasks of classifying histological and immunohistochemical breast cancer subtypes from genotype and phenotype data. We demonstrate that REM efficiently extracts accurate, comprehensible rulesets from deep neural networks that can be readily integrated with rulesets obtained from tree-based approaches. REM provides explanation facilities for predictions and enables the clinicians to validate and calibrate the extracted rulesets with their domain knowledge. With these functionalities, REM caters for a novel and direct human-in-the-loop approach in clinical decision-making.",

They are hard to detect in large sequence databases either with the alignment-based profile methods (due to short length and diversity) or with generic amyloid- and prion-finding tools (due to insufficient discriminative power). We propose to address the challenge with a machine learning grammatical model capable of generalizing over diverse collections of unaligned yet related motifs.\n\nResultsFirst, we introduce and test improvements to our probabilistic context-free grammar framework for protein sequences that allow for inferring more sophisticated models achieving high sensitivity at low false positive rates. Then, we infer universal grammars for a collection of recently identified bacterial amyloid signaling motifs and demonstrate that the method is capable of generalizing by successfully searching for related motifs in fungi. The results are compared to available alternative methods. Finally, we conduct spectroscopy analyses of selected peptides to verify their structural and functional relationship.\n\nConclusionsWhile the profile HMMs remain the method of choice for modeling homologous sets of sequences, PCFGs seem more suitable for building meta-family descriptors and extrapolating beyond the seed sample.",

Taking advantage of the unusually long assemblies produced by this approach, we recovered nearly 3,000 BGCs for analysis, including 695 novel, full-length BGCs. Functional exploration through metatranscriptome analysis of a 3-day wetting experiment uncovered phylum-specific BGC expression upon activation from dormancy, elucidating distinct roles and complex phylogenetic and temporal dynamics in wetting processes. For example, a pronounced increase in BGC transcription occurs at night in cyanobacteria but not in other phyla, implicating BGCs in nutrient scavenging roles and niche competition. Taken together, our results demonstrate that long-read metagenomic sequencing combined with metatranscriptomic analysis provides a direct view into the functional dynamics of BGCs in environmental processes and suggests a central role of secondary metabolites in maintaining phylogenetically conserved niches within biocrusts.",

Interactive visualization of tissue-specific eQTLs can facilitate our understanding of functional variants relevant to disease-related traits. However, combining the multi-dimensional nature of eQTLs into a concise and informative visualization is challenging. Existing eQTL visualization tools provide useful ways to summarize the unprecedented scale of transcriptomic data but are not necessarily tailored to answer questions about the functional interpretations of trait-associated variants or other variants of interest. We developed FIVEx, an interactive eQTL browser with an intuitive interface tailored to the functional interpretation of associated variants. It features the ability to navigate seamlessly between different data views while providing relevant tissue- and locus-specific information to offer users a better understanding of population-scale multi-tissue transcriptomic profiles. Our implementation of the FIVEx browser on the Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset provides important insights for understanding potential tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms underlying trait-associated signals.\n\nAvailability and implementationA FIVEx instance visualizing GTEx v8 data can be found at https://eqtl.pheweb.org.
