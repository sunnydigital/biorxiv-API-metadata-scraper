    "abstract": "Infinium methylation arrays are not available for the vast majority of non-human mammals. Moreover, even if species-specific arrays were available, probe differences between them would confound cross-species comparisons. To address these challenges, we developed the mammalian methylation array, a single custom array that measures 36k CpGs that are well conserved across mammalian species. We designed a set of probes on the array that can tolerate specific cross-species mutations. We annotate the array in over 200 species and report CpG island status and chromatin states in select species. Calibration experiments demonstrate the high fidelity in humans, rats, and mice. The mammalian methylation array has several strengths: it applies to all mammalian species even those that have not yet been sequenced, it provides deep coverage of conserved cytosines facilitating the development epigenetic biomarkers, and it increases the probability that biological insights gained in one species will translate to others.",

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that cerebrovascular function and oxygen consumption are altered in multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we quantified the vascular and oxygen metabolic MRI burden in patients with MS (PwMS) and assessed the relationship between these MRI measures of and metrics of damage and disability. In PwMS and in matched healthy volunteers, we applied a newly developed dual-calibrated fMRI method of acquisition and analysis to map grey matter (GM) cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) and effective oxygen diffusivity of the capillary network (DC). We also quantified physical and cognitive function in PwMS and controls. There was no significant difference in GM volume between 22 PwMS and 20 healthy controls (p=0.302). Significant differences in CBF (PwMS vs. controls: 44.91 {+/-} 6.10 vs. 48.90 {+/-} 5.87 ml/100g/min, p=0.010), CMRO2 (117.69 {+/-} 17.31 vs. 136.49 {+/-} 14.48 mol/100g/min p<0.001) and DC (2.70 {+/-} 0.51 vs. 3.18 {+/-} 0.41 mol/100g/mmHg/min, p=0.002) were observed in the PwMS. No significant between-group differences were observed for OEF (PwMS vs. controls: 0.38 {+/-} 0.09 vs. 0.39 {+/-} 0.02, p=0.358). Regional analysis showed widespread reductions in CMRO2 and DC for PwMS compared to healthy volunteers. There was a significant correlation between physiological measures and T2 lesion volume, but no association with current clinical disability. Our findings demonstrate concurrent reductions in oxygen supply and consumption in the absence of an alteration in oxygen extraction that may be indicative of a reduced demand for oxygen (O2), an impaired transfer of O2 from capillaries to mitochondria, and/or a reduced ability to utilise O2 that is available at the mitochondria. With no between-group differences in GM volume, our results suggest that changes in brain physiology may precede MRI-detectable GM loss and thus may be one of the pathological drivers of neurodegeneration and disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Naegleria fowleri is a pathogenic free-living amoeba that is commonly found in warm, freshwater and can cause a rapidly fulminant disease known as primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). New drugs are urgently needed to treat PAM, as the fatality rate is >97%. Until recently, few advances have been made in the discovery of new drugs for N. fowleri and one drawback is the lack of validated tools and methods to enhance drug discovery and diagnostics research. In this study we aimed to validate alternative methods to assess cell proliferation that are commonly used for other cell types and develop a novel drug screening assay to evaluate drug efficacy on N. fowleri replication. EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) is a pyrimidine analog of thymidine that can be used as a quantitative endpoint for cell proliferation. EdU incorporation is detected via a copper catalyzed click reaction with an Alexa Fluor linked azide. EdU incorporation in replicating N. fowleri was validated using fluorescence microscopy and quantitative methods for assessing EdU incorporation were developed by using an imaging flow cytometer. Currently used PAM therapeutics inhibited N. fowleri replication and EdU incorporation in vitro. EdA (5'ethynyl-2'-deoxyadenosine), an adenine analog, also was incorporated by N. fowleri, but was more cytotoxic than EdU. In summary, EdU incorporation could be used as a complimentary method for drug discovery for these neglected pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Many wound-healing assays are used in cell biology and biomedicine; they are often labor intensive and/or require specialized and costly equipment. We describe a contactless method to create wounds with any imaginable 2D pattern in cell monolayers using micro-jets of either media or an immiscible and biocompatible fluorocarbon (i.e., FC40). We also combine this with another method that allows automation and multiplexing using standard Petri dishes. A dish is filled with a thin film of media overlaid with FC40, and the two liquids reshaped into an array of microchambers in minutes. Each chamber in such a grid is isolated from others by fluid walls of FC40. Cells are now added, allowed to grow into a monolayer, and wounds created using the microjets; then, healing is monitored by microscopy. As arrays of chambers can be made using the media and Petri dishes familiar to biologists, and as dishes fit seamlessly into their incubators, microscopes, and workflows, we anticipate this assay will find wide application in biomedicine.",

    "abstract": "Rapid spread of COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented pandemic worldwide, and an inserted furin site in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) may account for increased transmissibility. Plasmin, and other host proteases, may cleave the furin site of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and {gamma} subunits of epithelial sodium channels ({gamma} ENaC), resulting in an increment in virus infectivity and channel activity. As for the importance of ENaC in the regulation of airway surface and alveolar fluid homeostasis, whether SARS-CoV-2 will share and strengthen the cleavage network with ENaC proteins at the single-cell level is urgently worthy of consideration. To address this issue, we analyzed single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) datasets, and found the PLAU (encoding urokinase plasminogen activator), SCNN1G ({gamma}ENaC), and ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) were co-expressed in alveolar epithelial, basal, club, and ciliated epithelial cells. The relative expression level of PLAU, TMPRSS2, and ACE2 were significantly upregulated in severe COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines using Seurat and DESeq2 R packages. Moreover, the increments in PLAU, FURIN, TMPRSS2, and ACE2 were predominately observed in different epithelial cells and leukocytes. Accordingly, SARS-CoV-2 may share and strengthen the ENaC fibrinolytic proteases network in ACE2 positive airway and alveolar epithelial cells, which may expedite virus infusion into the susceptible cells and bring about ENaC associated edematous respiratory condition.",

    "abstract": "Infection of human cells by pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, typically proceeds by cell surface binding to a crucial receptor. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a necessary receptor, but not all ACE2-expressing cells are equally infected, suggesting that other extracellular factors are involved in host cell invasion by SARS-CoV-2. Vimentin is an intermediate filament protein that is increasingly recognized as being present on the extracellular surface of a subset of cell types, where it can bind to and facilitate pathogens cellular uptake. Here, we present evidence that extracellular vimentin might act as a critical component of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-ACE2 complex in mediating SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. We demonstrate direct binding between vimentin and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus coated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and show that antibodies against vimentin block in vitro SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of ACE2-expressing cells. Our results suggest new therapeutic strategies for preventing and slowing SARS-CoV-2 infection, focusing on targeting cell host surface vimentin.",

At the cellular level, pyramidal neurons and interneurons showed disparate changes, whereas the proportion of non-neuronal cells increased steadily. A probabilistic Bayesian network demonstrated an aberrant and oscillating physiological interaction between oligodendrocytes and interneurons in driving seizures. Validating the Bayesian inference, we showed that the cell types driving the seizures were associated with known antiepileptic and epileptic drugs. These findings provide predictive biomarkers of epilepsy, insights into the cellular connections and causal changes associated with TLE and a drug discovery method focusing on these events.",

We also achieved prime editing in the retina and retina pigment epithelium in wild-type mice by delivering prime editor 3 using trans-splicing adeno-associated virus. Deep sequencing showed that unintended edits at or near the target site or off-target effects were not detectable except for low levels (0% to 1.2%) of indels when PE3, but not PE2, was used.

    "abstract": "In modern humans, facial soft tissue thicknesses have been shown to covary with craniometric dimensions. However, to date it has not been confirmed whether these relationships are shared with non-human apes. In this study, we analyze these relationships in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with the aim of producing regression models for approximating facial soft tissue thicknesses in Plio-Pleistocene hominid individuals. Using CT scans of 19 subjects, 637 soft tissue, and 349 craniometric measurements, statistically significant multiple regression models were established for 26 points on the face and head. Examination of regression model validity resulted in minimal differences between observed and predicted soft tissue thickness values. Assessment of interspecies compatibility using a bonobo (Pan paniscus) and modern human (Homo sapiens) subject resulted in minimal differences for the bonobo but large differences for the modern human. These results clearly show that (1) soft tissue thicknesses covary with craniometric dimensions in P. troglodytes, (2) confirms that such covariation is uniformly present in both extant Homo and Pan species, and (3) suggests that chimp-derived regression models have interspecies compatibility with hominids who have similar craniometric dimensions to P. troglodytes. As the craniometric dimensions of early hominids, such as South African australopithecines, are more similar to P. troglodytes than those of H. sapiens, chimpanzee-derived regression models may be used for approximating their craniofacial anatomy. It is hoped that the results of the present study and the reference dataset for facial soft tissue thicknesses of chimpanzees it provides will encourage further research into this topic.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is a common epigenetic mark that influences transcriptional regulation, and therefore cellular phenotype, across all domains of life, extending also to bacterial virulence. Both orphan methyltransferases and those from restriction modification systems (RMSs) have been co-opted to regulate virulence epigenetically in many bacteria. However, the potential regulatory role of DNA methylation mediated by archetypal Type I systems in Escherichia coli has never been studied. We demonstrated that removal of DNA methylated mediated by three different Escherichia coli Type I RMSs in three distinct E. coli strains had no detectable effect on gene expression or growth in a screen of 1190 conditions. Additionally, deletion of the Type I RMS EcoUTI in UTI89, a prototypical cystitis strain of E. coli, which led to loss of methylation at >750 sites across the genome, had no detectable effect on virulence in a murine model of ascending urinary tract infection (UTI). Finally, introduction of two heterologous Type I RMSs into UTI89 also resulted in no detectable change in gene expression or growth phenotypes. These results stand in sharp contrast with many reports of RMSs regulating gene expression in other bacteria, leading us to propose the concept of \"regulation avoidance\" for these E. coli Type I RMSs. We hypothesize that regulation avoidance is a consequence of evolutionary adaptation of both the RMSs and the E. coli genome. Our results provide a clear and (currently) rare example of regulation avoidance for Type I RMSs in multiple strains of E. coli, further study of which may provide deeper insights into the evolution of gene regulation and horizontal gene transfer.\n\nAuthor summaryDNA methylation is perhaps the most common epigenetic modification, and it is commonly associated with gene regulation (in nearly all organisms) and virulence (particularly well studied in bacteria). Regarding bacterial virulence, the current DNA methylation literature has focused primarily on orphan methyltransferases or phasevariable restriction modification systems (RMSs). Interestingly, no reports have studied the potential regulatory role of the first RMS discovered, the Type I RMS EcoKI. We used transcriptomics, Phenotype Microarrays, and a murine model of urinary tract infection to screen for functional consequences due to Type I methylation in three unrelated strains of E. coli. Remarkably, we found zero evidence for any epigenetic regulation mediated by these Type I RMSs. Thus, these Type I RMSs appear to function exclusively in host defense against incoming DNA (the canonical function of RMSs), while the methylation status of many hundreds of the corresponding recognition sites has no detectable impact on gene expression or any phenotypes. This led us to the concept of \"regulation avoidance\" by such DNA methyltransferases, which contrasts with the current literature on bacterial epigenetics. Our study hints at the existence of an entire class of regulation avoidant systems, which provides new perspectives on methylation-mediated gene regulation and bacterial genome evolution.",
