    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer is a significant driver of evolutionary dynamics across microbial populations. Although the benefits of the acquisition of new genetic material are often quite clear, experiments across systems have demonstrated that gene transfer events can cause significant phenotypic changes and entail fitness costs in a way that is dependent on the genomic and environmental context. Here we test for the generality of one previously identified cost, sensitization of cells to the antibiotic nalidixic acid after acquisition of a [~]1Mb megaplasmid, across Pseudomonas strains and species. Overall, we find that the presence of this megaplasmid sensitizes many different Pseudomonas strains to nalidixic acid, but that this same horizontal gene transfer event increases resistance of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 to nalidixic acid across assays as well as to ciprofloxacin under competitive conditions. These phenotypic results are not easily explained away as secondary consequences of overall fitness effects and appear to occur independently of another cost associated with this megaplasmid, sensitization to higher temperatures. Lastly, we draw parallels between these reported results and the phenomenon of sign epistasis for de novo mutations and explore how context dependence of effects of plasmid acquisition could impact overall evolutionary dynamics and the evolution of antimicrobial resistance.\n\nImportanceNumerous studies have demonstrated that gene transfer events (e.g. plasmid acquisition) can entail a variety of costs that arise as byproducts of the incorporation of foreign DNA into established physiological and genetic systems. These costs can be ameliorated through evolutionary time by the occurrence of compensatory mutations, which stabilize presence of a horizontally transferred region within the genome but which also may skew future adaptive possibilities for these lineages. Here we demonstrate another possible outcome, that phenotypic changes arising as a consequence of the same horizontal gene transfer event are costly to some strains but may actually be beneficial in other genomic backgrounds under the right conditions. These results provide new a new viewpoint for considering conditions that promote plasmid maintenance and highlight the influence of genomic and environmental contexts when considering amelioration of fitness costs after HGT events.",

    "abstract": "Viruses have long been viewed as entities possessing extremely limited metabolic capacities. Over the last decade, however, this view has been challenged, as metabolic genes have been identified in viruses possessing large genomes and virions--the synthesis of which is energetically demanding. Here, we unveil peculiar phenotypic and genomic features of Prymnesium kappa virus RF01 (PkV RF01), a giant virus of the Mimiviridae family. We found that this virus encodes an unprecedented number of proteins involved in energy metabolism, such as all four succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunits (A-D) as well as key enzymes in the {beta}-oxidation pathway. The SDHA gene was transcribed upon infection, indicating that the viral SDH is actively used by the virus-- potentially to modulate its hosts energy metabolism. We detected orthologous SDHA and SDHB genes in numerous genome fragments from uncultivated marine Mimiviridae viruses, which suggests that the viral SDH is widespread in oceans. PkV RF01 was less virulent compared with other cultured prymnesioviruses, a phenomenon possibly linked to the metabolic capacity of this virus and suggestive of relatively long co-evolution with its hosts. It also has a unique morphology, compared to other characterized viruses in the Mimiviridae family. Finally, we found that PkV RF01 is the only alga-infecting Mimiviridae virus encoding two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and enzymes corresponding to an entire base-excision repair pathway, as seen in heterotroph-infecting Mimiviridae. These Mimiviridae encoded-enzymes were found to be monophyletic and branching at the root of the eukaryotic tree of life. This placement suggests that the last common ancestor of Mimiviridae was endowed with a large, complex genome prior to the divergence of known extant eukaryotes.\n\nImportanceViruses on Earth are tremendously diverse in terms of morphology, functionality, and genomic composition. Over the last decade, the conceptual gap separating viruses and cellular life has tightened because of the detection of metabolic genes in viral genomes that express complex virus phenotypes upon infection. Here, we describe Prymnesium kappa virus RF01, a large alga-infecting virus with a unique morphology, an atypical infection profile, and an unprecedented number of genes involved in energy metabolism (such as the tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle and the {beta}-oxidation pathway). Moreover, we show that the gene corresponding to one of these enzymes (the succinate dehydrogenase subunit A) is transcribed during infection and is widespread among marine viruses. This discovery provides evidence that a virus has the potential to actively regulate energy metabolism with its own gene.",

    "abstract": "The P-loop Walker A motif underlies hundreds of essential enzyme families that bind nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) and mediate phosphoryl transfer (P-loop NTPases), including the earliest DNA/RNA helicases, translocases and recombinases. What were the primordial precursors of these enzymes? Could these large and complex proteins emerge from simple polypeptides? Previously, we showed that P-loops embedded in simple {beta} repeat proteins bind NTPs, but also, unexpectedly so, ssDNA and RNA. Here, we extend beyond the purely biophysical function of ligand binding to demonstrate rudimentary helicase-like activities. We further constructed simple 40-residue polypeptides comprising just one {beta}-(P-loop)- element. Despite their simplicity, these P-loop prototypes confer functions such as strand separation and exchange. Foremost, these polypeptides unwind dsDNA, and upon addition of NTPs, or inorganic polyphosphates, release the bound ssDNA strands to allow reformation of dsDNA. Binding kinetics and low-resolution structural analyses indicate that activity is mediated by oligomeric forms spanning from dimers to high-order assemblies. The latter are reminiscent of extant P-loop recombinases such as RecA. Overall, these P-loop prototypes comprise a plausible description of the sequence, structure and function of the earliest P-loop NTPases. They also indicate that multifunctionality and dynamic assembly were key in endowing short polypeptides with elaborate, evolutionarily relevant functions.\n\nSignificance statementIt is widely assumed that todays large and complex proteins emerged from much shorter and simpler polypeptides. Yet the nature of these early precursors remains enigmatic. We describe polypeptides that contain one of the earliest protein motifs, a phosphate-binding loop, or P-loop, embedded in a single beta-alpha element. These P-loop prototypes show intriguing characteristics of a primordial world comprised of nucleic acids and peptides. They are  generalists capable of binding different phospho-ligands, including inorganic polyphosphates and single-stranded DNA. Nonetheless, in promoting double-stranded DNA unwinding and strand-exchange they resemble modern P-loop helicases and recombinases. Our study describes a missing link in the evolution of complex proteins - simple polypeptides that tangibly relate to contemporary P-loop enzymes in sequence, structure and function.",

    "abstract": "The study of resistomes using whole metagenomic sequencing enables high throughput identification of resistance genes in complex microbial communities, such as the human microbiome. Over recent years, sophisticated and diverse pipelines have been established to facilitate raw data processing and annotation. Despite the progress, there are no easy-to-use tools for comprehensive visual, statistical, and functional analysis of resistome data. Thus, exploration of the resulting large complex datasets remains a key bottleneck requiring robust computational resources and technical expertise, which creates a significant hurdle for advancements in the field.

    "abstract": "Beyond detecting brain lesions or tumors, comparatively little success has been attained in identifying brain disorders such as Alzheimers disease (AD), based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Many machine learning algorithms to detect AD have been trained using limited training data, meaning they often generalize poorly when applied to scans from previously unseen populations. Therefore, we built a practical brain MRI-based AD diagnostic classifier using deep learning/transfer learning on a dataset of unprecedented size and diversity. A retrospective MRI dataset pooled from more than 217 sites/scanners constituted one of the largest brain MRI samples to date (85,721 scans from 50,876 participants) between January 2017 and August 2021. Next, a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, Inception-ResNet-V2, was built as a sex classifier with high generalization capability. The sex classifier achieved 94.9% accuracy and served as a base model in transfer learning for the objective diagnosis of AD. After transfer learning, the model fine-tuned for AD classification achieved 90.9% accuracy in leave-sites-out cross-validation on the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, 6,857 samples) dataset and 94.5%/93.6%/91.1% accuracy for direct tests on three unseen independent datasets (AIBL, 669 samples / MIRIAD, 644 samples / OASIS, 1,123 samples). When this AD classifier was tested on brain images from unseen mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, MCI patients who converted to AD were 3 times more likely to be predicted as AD than MCI patients who did not convert (65.2% vs 20.6%). Predicted scores from the AD classifier showed significant correlations with illness severity. In sum, the proposed AD classifier offers a medical-grade marker that has potential to be integrated into AD diagnostic practice.",

Once a  decision is made to proceed, the cell unequivocally enters into a qualitatively different biochemical state, which makes the transitions from one cell cycle phase to the next switch-like and irreversible. Each transition is governed by a unique signalling network; nonetheless, they share a common characteristic of bistable behaviour, a hallmark of molecular memory devices. Comparing the cell cycle signalling mechanisms acting at the Restriction Point, G1/S, G2/M and meta-to-anaphase transitions, we deduce a generic network motif of coupled positive and negative feedback loops underlying each transition.",

    "abstract": "Protein-ligand binding prediction has extensive biological significance. Binding affinity helps in understanding the degree of protein-ligand interactions and has wide protein applications. Protein-ligand docking using virtual screening and molecular dynamic simulations are required to predict the binding affinity of a ligand to its cognate receptor. In order to perform such analyses, it requires intense computational power and it becomes impossible to cover the entire chemical space of small molecules. Recent developments using deep learning has enabled us to make sense of massive amounts of complex datasets where the ability of the model to \"learn\" intrinsic patterns in a complex plane of data is the strength of the approach. Here, we have incorporated Convolutional Neural Networks to find spatial relationships amongst data to help us predict affinity of binding of proteins in whole superfamilies towards a diverse set of ligands without the need of a docked pose or complex as input. The models were trained and validated using a detailed methodology for feature extraction. We have also tested DEELIG on protein complexes relevant to the current public health scenario. Our approach to network construction and training on protein-ligand dataset prepared in-house has yielded novel insights.",

Contralateral left knee joints had no intervention (controls). In 16-week-old C57BL/6 male mice (n = 6), osteoarthritis was induced using non-invasive mechanical loading of right knee joints with peak force of 11N. Non-loaded left knee joints were internal controls. Chondrocyte transiency in tibial articular cartilage and growth plate was confirmed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Tibial subchondral bone parameters were measured using microCT and correlated to 3D GP bridging analysis.\n\nResultsHigher expression of chondrocyte hypertrophy markers; Col10a1 and MMP13 were observed in tibial articular cartilage chondrocytes of DMM and loaded mice. In tibial growth plate, Col10a1 and MMP13 expressions were widely dispersed in a significantly enlarged zones of proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocytes in DMM (p=0.002 and p<0.0001, respectively) and loaded (both p<0.0001) tibiae of mice compared to their controls. 3D quantification revealed enriched growth plate bridging and higher bridge densities in medial compared to lateral tibiae of DMM and loaded knee joints of the mice. Growth plate dynamics were associated with higher subchondral bone volume fraction (BV/TV; %) in medial tibiae of DMM and loaded knee joints and epiphyseal trabecular bone volume fraction in medial tibiae of loaded knee joints.\n\nConclusionsThe results confirm articular cartilage chondrocyte transiency in a surgical and loaded murine model of osteoarthritis. Herein, we reveal for the first time spatial variation of growth plate bridging in surgical and loaded osteoarthritis models and how these may contribute to anatomical variation in vulnerability of osteoarthritis development.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary high-throughput mutagenesis experiments are providing an increasingly detailed view of the complex patterns of genetic interaction that occur between multiple mutations within a single protein or regulatory element. By simultaneously measuring the effects of thousands of combinations of mutations, these experiments have revealed that the genotype-phenotype relationship typically reflects genetic interactions not only between pairs of sites, but also higher-order interactions among larger numbers of sites. However, modeling and understanding these higher-order interactions remains challenging. Here, we present a method for reconstructing sequence-to-function mappings from partially observed data that can accommodate all orders of genetic interaction. The main idea is to make predictions for unobserved genotypes that match the type and extent of epistasis found in the observed data. This information on the type and extent of epistasis can be extracted by considering how phenotypic correlations change as a function of mutational distance, which is equivalent to estimating the fraction of phenotypic variance due to each order of genetic interaction (additive, pairwise, three-way, etc.). Using these estimated variance components, we then define an empirical Bayes prior that in expectation matches the observed pattern of epistasis, and reconstruct the genotype-phenotype mapping by conducting Gaussian process regression under this prior. To demonstrate the power of this approach, we present an application to the antibody-binding domain GB1 and also provide a detailed exploration of a dataset consisting of high-throughput measurements for the splicing efficiency of human pre-mRNA 5' splice sites, for which we also validate our model predictions via additional low-throughput experiments.",

Neural activity in the hippocampus exhibits place-cell sequences at multiple timescales, including slow behavioral sequences ([~]seconds) and fast theta sequences ([~]100-200 ms) within theta oscillation cycles. How prefrontal ensembles interact with hippocampal sequences to support decision-making is unclear. Here, we examined simultaneous hippocampal and prefrontal ensemble activity during learning of a spatial working-memory decision task. We found clear theta sequences in prefrontal cortex, nested within its behavioral sequences. In both regions, behavioral sequences maintained representations of current goals during navigation. In contrast, hippocampal theta sequences encoded alternatives for deliberation, and were coordinated with prefrontal theta sequences that predicted upcoming choices. During error trials, these representations were preserved to guide ongoing behavior, whereas replay sequences during inter-trial periods were impaired prior to navigation. These results establish cooperative interaction between hippocampal and prefrontal sequences at multiple timescales for memory-guided decision making.",

    "abstract": "Central nervous system (CNS) hyperexcitability is a clinically significant feature of acute ethanol withdrawal. There is evidence for a genetic contribution to withdrawal severity, but specific genetic risk factors have not be identified. The gene glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) has been previously implicated in ethanol consumption in mice, and GLO1 inhibition can attenuate drinking in mice and rats. Here, we investigated whether genetic and pharmacological manipulations of GLO1 activity can also mediate ethanol withdrawal seizure severity in mice. Mice from two transgenic lines overexpressing Glo1 on different genetic backgrounds (C57BL/6J [B6] and FVB/NJ [FVB]) were tested for handling induced convulsions (HICs) as a measure of acute ethanol withdrawal. Following an injection of 4 g/kg alcohol, both B6 and FVB mice overexpressing Glo1 showed increased HICs compared to wild type littermates, though only the FVB line showed a statistically significant difference. We also administered daily ethanol injections (2 g/kg + 9 mg/kg 4-methylpyrazole) to wild type B6 mice for 10 days and tested them for HICs on the 10th day, following treatment with either vehicle or a GLO1 inhibitor (S-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester [pBBG]). Treatment with pBBG reduced HICs, although this effect was only statistically significant following two 10-day cycles of ethanol exposure and withdrawal. These results provide converging genetic and pharmacological evidence that GLO1 can mediate ethanol withdrawal seizure susceptibility.

    "abstract": "The dynamical organization of brain networks is essential to support human cognition and emotion for rapid adaption to ever-changing environment. As the core nodes of emotion-related brain circuitry, the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and centromedial amygdala (CMA) as two major amygdalar nuclei, are recognized to play distinct roles in affective functions and internal states, via their unique connections with cortical and subcortical structures in rodents. However, little is known how the dynamical organization of emotion-related brain circuitry reflects internal autonomic responses in humans. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with K-means clustering approach in a total of 79 young healthy individuals (cohort 1: 42; cohort 2: 37), we identified two distinct states of BLA- and CMA-based intrinsic connectivity patterns, with one state (integration) showing generally stronger BLA- and CMA-based intrinsic connectivity with multiple brain networks, while the other (segregation) exhibiting weaker yet dissociable connectivity patterns. In an independent cohort 2 of fMRI data with concurrent recording of skin conductance, we replicated two similar dynamic states and further found higher skin conductance level in the integration than segregation state. Moreover, machine learning-based Elastic-net regression analyses revealed that time-varying BLA and CMA intrinsic connectivity with distinct network configurations yield higher predictive values for spontaneous fluctuations of skin conductance level in the integration than segregation state. Our findings highlight dynamic functional organization of emotion-related amygdala nuclei circuits and networks and its links to spontaneous autonomic arousal in humans.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin interactions play important roles in regulating gene expression. However, the availability of genome-wide chromatin interaction data is limited. Various computational methods have been developed to predict chromatin interactions. Most of these methods rely on large collections of ChIP-Seq/RNA-Seq/DNase-Seq datasets and predict only enhancer-promoter interactions. Some of the  state-of-the-art methods have poor experimental designs, leading to over-exaggerated performances and misleading conclusions. Here we developed a computational method, Chromatin Interaction Neural Network (ChINN), to predict chromatin interactions between open chromatin regions by using only DNA sequences of the interacting open chromatin regions. ChINN is able to predict CTCF-, RNA polymerase II- and HiC-associated chromatin interactions between open chromatin regions. ChINN also shows good across-sample performances and captures various sequence features that are predictive of chromatin interactions. To apply our results to clinical patient data, we applied CHINN to predict chromatin interactions in 6 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient samples and a cohort of open chromatin data from 84 CLL samples that was previously published. Our results demonstrated extensive heterogeneity in chromatin interactions in patient samples, and one of the sources of this heterogeneity were the different subtypes of CLL.",

After infection, how the virus tunes its genome to adapt and evolve in humans remains unknown. Through direct amplification of H7N9 and high throughput (HT) sequencing of full genomes from the swabs and lower respiratory tract samples collected from infected patients in Shenzhen, China, we have analyzed the in vivo H7N9 mutations at the level of whole genomes and have compared with the genomes derived by in vitro cultures. These comparisons and frequency analysis against the H7N9 genomes in the public database, 40 amino acids were identified that play potential roles in virus adaptation during H7N9 infection in humans. Various synonymous mutations were also identified that might be crucial to H7N9 adaptation in humans. The mechanism of these mutations occurred in a single infection are discussed in this study.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLINCS, \"Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures\", and IDG, \"Illuminating the Druggable Genome\", are both NIH projects and consortia that have generated rich datasets for the study of the molecular basis of human health and disease. LINCS L1000 expression signatures provide unbiased systems/omics experimental evidence. IDG provides compiled and curated knowledge for illumination and prioritization of novel drug target hypotheses. Together, these resources can support a powerful new approach to identifying novel drug targets for complex diseases, such as Parkinsons disease (PD), which continues to inflict severe harm on human health, and resist traditional research approaches.\n\nResultsIntegrating LINCS and IDG, we built the Knowledge Graph Analytics Platform (KGAP) to support an important use case: identification and prioritization of drug target hypotheses for associated diseases. The KGAP approach includes strong semantics interpretable by domain scientists and a robust, high performance implementation of a graph database and related analytical methods. Illustrating the value of our approach, we investigated results from queries relevant to PD. Approved PD drug indications from IDGs resource DrugCentral were used as starting points for evidence paths exploring chemogenomic space via LINCS expression signatures for associated genes, evaluated as target hypotheses by integration with IDG. The KG-analytic scoring function was validated against a gold standard dataset of genes associated with PD as elucidated, published mechanism-of-action drug targets, also from DrugCentral. IDGs resource TIN-X was used to rank and filter KGAP results for novel PD targets, and one, SYNGR3 (Synaptogyrin-3), was manually investigated further as a case study and plausible new drug target for PD.\n\nConclusionsThe synergy of LINCS and IDG, via KG methods, empowers graph analytics methods for the investigation of the molecular basis of complex diseases, and specifically for identification and prioritization of novel drug targets. The KGAP approach enables downstream applications via integration with resources similarly aligned with modern KG methodology. The generality of the approach indicates that KGAP is applicable to many disease areas, in addition to PD, the focus of this paper.",

    "abstract": "Functional characterization of H- and D-MATE (Multidrug and Toxin Extrusion) transporters from clinical isolates of Vibrio fluvialis revealed H-type conferred resistance to fluoroquinolones, ethidium bromide and safranin whereas D-type exhibited marginal resistance towards ethidium bromide only. Both H-/D-type transporters were inhibited by reserpine resulting in increased intracellular norfloxacin concentration. The efflux was facilitated by both Na+/K+ ions, suggesting that these efflux pumps were ion-dependent. In presence of various classes of EPIs, there was decrease in MIC exhibited by H-/D-type efflux pumps towards norfloxacin which didnt translate into transport inhibition. But reserpine presented a conclusive pattern with decrease in MIC towards norfloxacin and increased norfloxacin accumulation inferring maximum inhibition. Substrate binding and electrostatic charge distribution of both the transporters was similar to other known MATE transporters. The H-type exhibited 10 transmembranes and D-type exhibited 11 TMs which was different from other MATE transporters known to have 12 TMs (Transmembranes). Data derived from molecular docking and ion binding studies revealed that Aspartic Acid residue in 1st TM acts as ion binding site with transport mechanism similar to NorM. Electrostatic potential map of both the transporters revealed that there is a cavity formation within the transporters surrounded by charged electronegative amino acid residues. Interestingly, surface models of both transporters revealed that 1st TM forms covalent bond with 7th TM towards extracellular space. Docking studies also revealed that reserpine covalently binds to central pocket of both transporters and serves as excellent EPI against these transporters as evidenced by MIC and drug accumulation assays.",

    "abstract": "Evidence of homology between proteins in the ATP synthetase and the bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) has been accumulating since the 1980s. Specifically, the BFMs Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) export apparatus FliH, FliI, and FliJ are considered homologous to FO-b + F1-{delta}, F1-/{beta}, and F1-{gamma}, and have similar structure and interactions. We review the discoveries that advanced the homology hypothesis and then conduct a further test by examining gene order in the two systems and their relatives. Conservation of gene order, or synteny, is often observed between closely related prokaryote species, but usually degrades with phylogenetic distance. As a result, observed conservation of synteny over vast phylogenetic distances can be evidence of shared ancestral coexpression, interaction, and function. We constructed a gene order dataset by examining the order of fliH, fliI, and fliJ genes across the phylogenetic breadth of flagellar and nonflagellar T3SS. We compared this to published surveys of gene order in the F1FO-ATP synthetase, its N-ATPase relatives, and the bacterial/archaeal V- and A-type ATPases. Strikingly, the fliHIJ gene order was deeply conserved, with the few exceptions appearing derived, and exactly matching the widely conserved F-ATPase gene order atpFHAG, coding for subunits b-{delta}--{gamma}. The V/A-type ATPases have a similar conserved gene order shared for homologous components. Our results further strengthen the argument for homology between these systems, and suggest a rare case of synteny conserved over billions of years, dating back to well before the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA).",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 remains an incurable infection that is associated with substantial economic and epidemiologic impacts. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are commonly linked with HIV-1 infection; despite the development of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), HAND is still reported to affect at least 50% of HIV-1 infected individuals. It is believed that the over-amplification of inflammatory pathways, along with release of toxic viral proteins from infected cells, are primarily responsible for the neurological damage that is observed in HAND; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well-defined. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop more physiologically relevant and reliable platforms for studying these pathologies. In recent years, neurospheres derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been utilized to model the effects of different neurotropic viruses. Here, we report the generation of neurospheres from iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and we show that these cultures are permissive to retroviral (e.g. HIV-1, HTLV-1) replication. In addition, we also examine the potential effects of stem cell derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) on HIV-1 damaged cells as there is abundant literature supporting the reparative and regenerative properties of stem cell EVs in the context of various CNS pathologies. Consistent with the literature, our data suggests that stem cell EVs may modulate neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties in damaged cells. Collectively, this study demonstrates the feasibility of NPC-derived neurospheres for modeling HIV-1 infection and, subsequently, highlights the potential of stem cell EVs for rescuing cellular damage induced by HIV-1 infection.",

    "abstract": "VAPB (VPR-1 in C. elegans) is a type-II ER transmembrane protein whose N-terminal Major Sperm Protein domain (MSPd) is cleaved and secreted. Mutations in the MSPd of human VAPB cause impaired secretion and are associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In C. elegans, the secreted MSPd signals non-cell-autonomously to regulate striated muscle mitochondrial morphology and gonad development. As VAPB/VPR-1 does not have a signal peptide and its MSPd extends into the cytosol, it is unclear how the protein is proteolytically cleaved and secreted. To identify genes that are involved in VPR-1 cleavage and unconventional secretion, we performed an RNA interference (RNAi) screen in C. elegans. Worms null for vpr-1 are sterile and have striated muscle mitochondrial abnormalities. These defects can be rescued by vpr-1 expression in the neurons, germline, or intestine, implying that these three tissues share a common machinery to cleave and secrete the MSPd. Examination of shared gene expression in these tissues revealed a list of 422 genes, which we targeted with RNAi. vpr-1 null worms expressing vpr-1 from intestine were used in the screen, and the brood size of these worms after RNAi knockdown was scored. Disruption of factors involved in VPR-1 MSPd processing and/or secretion should revert fertility phenotypes in these worms. We identified many genes that induce compromised fertility when knocked down in these but not wild type worms, including a V-SNARE, several proteasome components, stress response molecules, and mitochondrial genes. Our screen thus identified many potential players involved in MSPd processing and/or secretion.\n\nSummaryThe MSP domain (MSPd) of a type-II ER transmembrane protein called VAPB is cleaved and secreted to function as a non-cell-autonomous signal. The topology of VAPB positions MSPd in the cytosol. It is thus unclear how MSPd is cleaved from VAPB and released extracellularly. Using C. elegans, we screened 422 genes by RNAi to identify potential candidates regulating MSPd cleaving and secretion. We identified the Golgi v-SNARE YKT-6 and several components of the 20S and 19S proteasome that may mediate MSPd trafficking and cleaving, respectively. These results have promising implications in advancing our understanding of MSPd signaling.",

Yet, there are few, if any, examples of a metabolic pathway that actively drives a cell cycle event instead of just being required for it. Here, we show that translational upregulation of lipogenic enzymes in yeast increased the abundance of lipids and accelerated nuclear elongation and division. De-repressing translation of acetyl CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase also suppressed cell cycle-related phenotypes, including delayed nuclear division, associated with Sec14p phosphatidylinositol transfer protein deficiencies, and the irregular nuclear morphologies of mutants defective in phosphatidylinositol 4-OH kinase activities. Our results show that increased lipogenesis drives a critical cell cycle landmark and report a phosphoinositide signaling axis in control of nuclear division. The broad conservation of these lipid metabolic and signaling pathways raises the possibility these activities similarly govern nuclear division in mammals.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo examine the contribution of PEDF-R to the phagocytosis process. Previously, we identified PEDF-R, the protein encoded by the PNPLA2 gene, as a phospholipase A2 in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). During phagocytosis, RPE cells ingest abundant phospholipids and protein in the form of photoreceptor outer segment (POS) tips, which are then hydrolyzed. The role of PEDF-R in RPE phagocytosis is not known.\n\nMethodsMice in which PNPLA2 was conditionally knocked out in the RPE were generated (cKO). Mouse RPE/choroid explants were cultured. Human ARPE-19 cells were transfected with siPNPLA2 silencing duplexes. POS were isolated from bovine retinas. The phospholipase A2 inhibitor bromoenol lactone was used. Transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, lipid labeling, pulse-chase experiments, western blots, and free fatty acid and {beta}-hydroxybutyrate assays were performed.\n\nResultsThe RPE of the cKO mice accumulated lipids as well as more abundant and larger rhodopsin particles compared to littermate controls. Upon POS exposure, RPE explants from cKO mice released less {beta}-hydroxybutyrate compared to controls. After POS ingestion during phagocytosis, rhodopsin degradation was stalled both in cells treated with bromoenol lactone and in PNPLA2-knocked-down cells relative to their corresponding controls. Phospholipase A2 inhibition lowered {beta}-hydroxybutyrate release from phagocytic RPE cells. PNPLA2 knock down also resulted in a decline in fatty acids and {beta}-hydroxybutyrate release from phagocytic RPE cells.\n\nConclusionsPEDF-R downregulation delayed POS digestion during phagocytosis. The findings imply that efficiency of RPE phagocytosis depends on PEDF-R, thus identifying a novel contribution of this protein to POS degradation in the RPE.",

    "abstract": "Recent structural studies of ex vivo amyloid filaments extracted from human patients demonstrated that the ex vivo filaments associated with different disease phenotypes adopt diverse molecular conformations distinct from those in vitro amyloid filaments. A very recent cryo-EM structural study also revealed that ex vivo -synuclein filaments extracted from multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients adopt quite distinct molecular structures from those of in vitro -synuclein filaments, suggesting the presence of co-factors for -synuclein aggregation in vivo. Here, we report structural characterizations of -synuclein filaments derived by a potential co-factor, tau, using cryo-EM and solid-state NMR. Our cryo-EM structure of the tau-promoted -synuclein filament at 4.0 [A] resolution is somewhat similar to one of the polymorphs of in vitro -synuclein filaments. However, the N- and C-terminal regions of the tau-promoted -synuclein filament have different molecular conformations. Our structural studies highlight the conformational plasticity of -synuclein filaments, requiring additional structural investigation of not only more ex vivo -synuclein filaments, but also in vitro -synuclein filaments formed in the presence of diverse co-factors to better understand molecular basis of diverse molecular conformations of -synuclein filaments.",

    "abstract": "It can be found from the results that nano hydroxyapatite- silver -3.0 wt% carageenan (nHA-Ag-CG3.0) improved the mechanical properties of the as-formed hydrogel scaffold after incorporation of higher CG concentration. The Youngs modulus of hydroxyapatite- silver - 1.5wt% carageenan (nHA-Ag-CG1.5) was found to be 0.36 {+/-} 0.07 MPa that increased in case of nHA-Ag-CG3.0 demonstrating better interfacial compatibility of their matrix with respect to the reinforcement. This increase in reinforcement concentration resulted in higher stiffness that dissipated energy. The higher swelling ratio is envisaged to induce better cell adhesion and proliferation. The biodegradability test was performed in phosphate buffered saline at body temperature for 3 weeks. The biodegradability rate of nHA-Ag-CG1.5 was found to be equivalent to nHA-Ag-CG3.0 hydrogels at day 7 while it increased faster in nHA-Ag-CG3.0 on days 14 and 21 that may be ascribed to the possible interaction of nHA and Ag with their CG matrix. The bacterial cell viability of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was performed after 10 h, 20 h and 30 h of culture. The nHA-Ag-CG1.5 exhibited restrained growth of S. aureus as compared to nHA-Ag-CG3.0 and these results were validated by CLSM analysis. Hence, nHA-Ag-CG3.0 may be considered to have more cytocompatibility than nHA-Ag-CG 1.5.",

    "abstract": "Commodity chemicals are high-demand chemicals, used by chemical industries to synthesise cocountless chemical products of daily use. For many of these chemicals, the main production process uses petroleum-based feedstocks. Concerns over these limited resources and their associated environmental problems, as well as mounting global pressure to reduce CO2 emissions have motivated efforts to find biochemical pathways capable of producing these chemicals. Advances in metabolic engineering have led to the development of technologies capable of designing novel biochemical pathways to commodity chemicals. Computational software tools, ReactPRED and RetroPath2.0 were utilised to design 49 novel pathways to produce benzene, phenol, and 1,2-propanediol -- all industrially important chemicals with limited biochemical knowledge. A pragmatic methodology for pathway curation was developed to analyse thousands and millions of pathways that were generated using the software. This method utilises publicly accessible biological databases, including MetaNetX, PubChem, and MetaCyc to analyse the generated outputs and assign EC numbers to the predicted reactions. The workflow described here for pathway generation and curation can be used to develop novel biochemical pathways to commodity chemicals from numerous starting compounds.",

Although a number of methods have demonstrated promising results in integrating multiple modalities from the same tissue, the complexity and scale of data compositions typically present in cell atlases still pose a significant challenge for existing methods. Here we present scJoint, a transfer learning method to integrate atlas-scale, heterogeneous collections of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. scJoint leverages information from annotated scRNA-seq data in a semi-supervised framework and uses a neural network to simultaneously train labeled and unlabeled data, enabling label transfer and joint visualization in an integrative framework. Using multiple atlas data and a biologically varying multi-modal data, we demonstrate scJoint is computationally efficient and consistently achieves significantly higher cell type label accuracy than existing methods while providing meaningful joint visualizations. This suggests scJoint is effective in overcoming the heterogeneity in different modalities towards a more comprehensive understanding of cellular phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Advances in genome-resolved metagenomic analysis of complex microbial communities have revealed a large degree of interspecies and intraspecies genetic diversity through the reconstruction of metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). Yet, metabolic modeling efforts still tend to rely on reference genomes as the starting point for reconstruction and simulation of genome scale metabolic models (GEMs), neglecting the immense intra- and inter-species diversity present in microbial communities. Here we present metaGEM (https://github.com/franciscozorrilla/metaGEM), an end-to-end highly scalable pipeline enabling metabolic modeling of multi-species communities directly from metagenomic samples. The pipeline automates all steps from the extraction of context-specific prokaryotic GEMs from metagenome assembled genomes to community level flux balance simulations. To demonstrate the capabilities of the metaGEM pipeline, we analyzed 483 samples spanning lab culture, human gut, plant associated, soil, and ocean metagenomes, to reconstruct over 14 000 prokaryotic GEMs. We show that GEMs reconstructed from metagenomes have fully represented metabolism comparable to the GEMs reconstructed from reference genomes. We further demonstrate that metagenomic GEMs capture intraspecies metabolic diversity by identifying the differences between pathogenicity levels of type 2 diabetes at the level of gut bacterial metabolic exchanges. Overall, our pipeline enables simulation-ready metabolic model reconstruction directly from individual metagenomes, provides a resource of all reconstructed metabolic models, and showcases community-level modeling of microbiomes associated with disease conditions allowing generation of mechanistic hypotheses.",

Although several computational tissue reconstruction methods using transcriptomic data have been proposed, those methods are insufficient with regard to arranging cells in their correct positions in tissues or organs unless spatial information is explicitly provided. Here, we propose eSPRESSO, a powerful in silico three-dimensional (3D) tissue reconstruction method using stochastic self-organizing map (stochastic-SOM) clustering, together with optimization of gene set by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework, to estimate the spatial domain structure of cells in any topology of tissues or organs from only their transcriptome profiles. We confirmed the performance of eSPRESSO by mouse embryo, embryonic heart, adult cortical layers, and human pancreas organoid with high reproducibility (success rate = 72.5-100%), while discovering morphologically important spatial discriminator genes (SDGs). Furthermore, we applied eSPRESSO to analysis of human adult heart diseases by virtual gene knockouts, and revealed candidate mechanisms of deformation of heart structure. The eSPRESSO may provide novel methods to analyze the mechanisms of 3D structure formation and morphology-based disease mechanisms.",

As a case-study, we investigate the detoxification of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic food contaminant, by laccase, a versatile oxidase capable of--but not efficient for--degrading aflatoxin. We use a combination of quantitative experimentation and QM modeling to show that low enzymatic steric affinity for aflatoxin is the main bottleneck, rather that the oxidative activity of laccase. To identify the structural elements responsible for low reaction rates, we perform a density functional theory (DFT) based modeling of both the substrate and the enzyme in a full QM simulation of more than 7,000 atoms. Thanks to our approach we point to amino acid residues that determine the affinity of laccase for aflatoxin. We show that these residues are substrate-dependent, making a full QM approach necessary for enzyme optimization. Altogether, we establish a roadmap for rational enzyme engineering applicable beyond our case study.",

    "abstract": "The balance between the mitochondrial respiratory chain activity and the cells needs in ATP ensures optimal cellular function. Cytochrome c is an essential component of the electron transport chain (ETC), which regulates ETC activity, oxygen consumption, ATP synthesis and can initiate apoptosis. The impact of conformational changes in cytochrome c on its function is not understood for lack of access to these changes in intact mitochondria. We have developed a novel sensor that uses unique properties of label-free surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to identify conformational changes in heme of cytochrome c and to elucidate their role in functioning mitochondria. We verify that molecule bond vibrations assessed by SERS is a reliable indicator of the heme conformation during changes in the inner mitochondrial membrane potential and ETC activity. We have found that cytochrome c heme reversibly switches between planar and ruffled conformations in response to the inner mitochondrial membrane potential and H+ concentration in the intermembrane space to regulate the efficiency of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, thus, adjusting the mitochondrial respiration to the cells consumption of ATP and the overall activity. The ability of the proposed SERS-based sensor to track mitochondrial function opens wide perspectives on cell bioenergetics.\n\nFor Table of Contents Only\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/425119v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (66K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@eaaf42org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19826f0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@245e8forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bc265d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "De novo lipogenesis produces lipids for membrane biosynthesis and cell signaling. Elevated lipogenesis is a major metabolic feature in cancer cells. In breast and other cancer types, genes involved in lipogenesis are highly upregulated, but the mechanisms that control their expression remain poorly understood. DAXX modulates gene expression through binding to diverse transcription factors although the functional impact of these diverse interactions remains to be defined. Our recent analysis indicates that DAXX is overexpressed in diverse cancer types. However, mechanisms underlying DAXXs oncogenic function remains elusive. Using global integrated transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses, we show that DAXX plays a key role in lipid metabolism. DAXX depletion attenuates, while its overexpression enhances, lipogenic gene expression, lipid synthesis and tumor growth. Mechanistically, DAXX interacts with SREBP1 and SREBP2 and activates SREBP-mediated transcription. DAXX associates with lipogenic gene promoters through SREBPs. Underscoring the critical roles for the DAXX-SREBP interaction for lipogenesis, SREBP2 knockdown attenuates tumor growth in cells with DAXX overexpression, and a DAXX mutant unable to bind SREBPs are incapable of promoting lipogenesis and tumor growth. Our results identify the DAXX-SREBP axis as an important pathway for tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) is the most common age-related dementia that promotes a decline in memory, thinking, and social skills. The initial stages of dementia can be associated with mild symptoms, and symptom progression to a more severe state is heterogeneous across patients. Recent work has demonstrated the potential for functional network mapping to assist in the prediction of symptomatic progression. However, this work has primarily used static functional connectivity (sFC) from rs-fMRI. Recently, dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) has been recognized as a powerful advance in functional connectivity methodology to differentiate brain network dynamics between healthy and diseased populations.\n\nMethodsGroup independent component analysis was applied to extract 17 components within the cognitive control network (CCN) from 1385 individuals across varying stages of AD symptomology. We estimated dFC among 17 components within the CCN, followed by clustering the dFCs into 3 recurring brain states and then estimated a hidden Markov model and the occupancy rate for each subject. Finally, we investigated the link between CCN dFC connectivity features with AD progression.\n\nResultsProgression of AD symptoms were associated with increases in connectivity within the middle frontal gyrus. Also, the AD with mild and severer symptoms showed less connectivity within the inferior parietal lobule and between this region with the rest of CCN. Finally, comparing with mild dementia, we found that the normal brain spends significantly more time in a state with lower within middle frontal gyrus connectivity and higher connectivity between the hippocampus and the rest of CCN, highlighting the importance of assessing the dynamics of brain connectivity in this disease.\n\nConclusionOur results suggest that AD progress not only alters the CCN connectivity strength but also changes the temporal properties in this brain network. This suggests the temporal and spatial pattern of CCN as a biomarker that differentiates different stages of AD.\n\nImpact StatementBy assuming that functional connectivity is static over time, many of previous studies have ignored the brain dynamic in Alzheimers disease progression. Here, a longitudinal resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data are used to explore the temporal changes of functional connectivity in the cognitive control network in Alzheimers disease progression. The result of this study would increase our understanding about the underlying mechanisms of Alzheimers Disease and help in finding future treatment of this neurological disorder.",

    "abstract": "Broadly reactive antibodies targeting the influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) head domain are thought to be rare and to require extensive somatic mutations or unusual structural features to achieve breadth against divergent HA subtypes. Here we describe common genetic and structural features of diverse human antibodies from several individuals recognizing the trimer interface (TI) of the influenza HA head, a recently identified site of vulnerability1-3. We examined the sequence of TI-reactive antibodies, determined crystal structures for TI antibody-antigen complexes, and analyzed the contact residues of the antibodies on HA to discover common genetic and structural features of TI antibodies. Our data reveal that many TI antibodies are encoded by a light chain variable gene segment incorporating a shared somatic mutation. In addition, these antibodies have a shared acidic residue in the heavy chain despite originating from diverse heavy chain variable gene segments. These studies show that the TI region of influenza HA is a major antigenic site with conserved structural features that are recognized by a common human B cell public clonotype. The canonical nature of this antibody-antigen interaction suggests that the TI epitope might serve as an important new target for structure-based vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "Understanding protective mechanisms of antibody recognition can inform vaccine and therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2. We discovered a new antibody, 910-30, that targets the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 receptor binding site as a member of a public antibody response encoded by IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 genes. We performed sequence and structural analyses to explore how antibody features correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Cryo-EM structures of 910-30 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer revealed its binding interactions and ability to disassemble spike. Despite heavy chain sequence similarity, biophysical analyses of IGHV3-53/3-66 antibodies highlighted the importance of native heavy:light pairings for ACE2 binding competition and for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. We defined paired heavy:light sequence signatures and determined antibody precursor prevalence to be ~1 in 44,000 human B cells, consistent with public antibody identification in several convalescent COVID-19 patients.

The two sites differ in several environmental and ecological variables including their endogenous benthic community in addition to their proximity to urban development and runoffs from inland watersheds. The composition of the microbial community was estimated using whole genome DNA shotgun sequencing. Although both sites exhibit a similar degree of richness, the less urbanized site (Maycocks reef at Hangmans Bay) is strongly concentrated with phototrophs. In comparison, the more urbanized location (Bellairs Research Institute) is enriched for copiotrophs, macroalgal symbionts and marine-related disease-bearing organisms from taxa scattered across the tree of life. Overall, our samples and associated measurements of chemical and environmental qualities of the water are in line with previous marine microbiome profiles of warm ocean surface waters. This suggests our approach captures salient information regarding the state of each coral reef site and sets the stage for larger longitudinal studies of coral reef dynamics in Barbados.",

    "abstract": "Rapid identification of a pathogen and the measurement of its antibiotic susceptibility are key elements in the diagnostic process of bacterial infections. Microfluidic technologies offer great control over handling and manipulation of low sample volumes with the possibility to study microbial cultures on the single-cell level. Downscaling the dimensions of cultivation systems directly results in a lower number of bacteria required for antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) and thus in a reduction of the time to result. The developed platform presented in this work allows the reading of pathogen resistance profiles within 2-3 hours based on the changes of the dissolved oxygen levels during bacterial cultivation. The platform contains hundreds of individual growth chambers prefilled with a hydrogel containing oxygen-sensing nanoprobes and different concentrations of antibiotic compounds. The performance of the microfluidic platform is tested using quality control Escherichia coli strains (ATCC 25922 and ATCC 35218) in response to different clinically relevant antibiotics. The achieved results are in agreement with values given in clinical reference guides and independent measurements using a clinical AST protocol. Finally, the platform is successfully used for AST of an E. coli clinical isolate obtained from a patient blood culture.",

Six normal donor urine and plasma samples, and specimens from four pregnant (PG) women carrying male fetuses underwent extractions with the JBS cfDNA extraction kit (kit J), MagMAX Cell-Free DNA Extraction kit (kit M), and QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (kit Q). Recovery of a PCR product spike-in, endogenous TP53, and Y-chromosome DNA was used to assess kit performance. Nucleosomal-sized DNA profiles varied among the kits, with prominent multi-nucleosomal-sized peaks present in urine and plasma DNA isolated by kits J and M only. Kit J recovered significantly more spike-in DNA compared with kit M or Q (p<0.001) from urine, and similar amounts from plasma (p=0.12). Applying DNApure to kit M- and Q-isolated DNA significantly improved the amplification efficiency of spike-in DNA from urine (p<0.001) and plasma (p[&le;]0.013). Furthermore, kit J isolated significantly more Y-chromosome DNA from PG urine compared to kit Q (p=0.05).

Therapeutic approaches targeting RNA-protein interactions have shown promising effects on some diseases that are previously regarded as  incurable. Here we developed a fluorescent on-bead screening platform: RNA pull-down-Confocal Nanoscanning (RP-CONA), to identify RNA-protein interaction modulators in eukaryotic cell extracts. Using RP-CONA, we identified small molecules that disrupt the interaction between HuR, an inhibitor of brain-enriched miR-7 biogenesis, and the conserved terminal loop of pri-miR-7-1. Importantly, miR-7s primary target is an mRNA of -Synuclein, which contributes to aetiology of Parkinsons disease. Our method identified a natural product quercetin as a molecule able to upregulate cellular miR-7 levels and downregulate the expression of -Synuclein. This opens up new therapeutic avenues towards treatment of Parkinsons disease as well as provides novel methodology to search for RNA-protein interaction modulators.",

    "abstract": "RCC patients frequently have increased numbers of immunosuppressive myeloid cells in circulation. High numbers of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the blood are associated with immune suppression as well as with cancer-related inflammation which drives the mobilization of myeloid cells to tumor tissue. Here we show that peripheral blood from a previously untreated renal cell carcinoma patient has increased numbers of monocytic CD33+CD11b+ MDSCs, which also co-expressed PD-L1 and membrane-bound enzyme hyaluronidase 2 (Hyal2). PD-L1 expression is associated with immune suppression, whereas expression of Hyal2 is associated with inflammation, because Hyal2+ myeloid cells can degrade the extracellular hyaluronan (HA), leading to the accumulation of pro-inflammatory HA fragments with low molecular weight. These findings implicate the potential involvement of monocytic MDSCs in both tumor-associated immune suppression and cancer-related inflammation. Analysis of organoid-like tumor-tissue slice cultures prepared from cancer tissue of the same patient revealed the significant presence of PD-L1+ HLA-DR+ macrophage-like or dendritic cell-like antigen-presenting cells in tumor stroma. Interestingly that stroma-associated PD-L1+ cells frequently have intracellular hyaluronan. Collectively, data presented in this study suggest that the interplay between tumor-recruited myeloid cells and stromal hyaluronan may contribute to the inflammation and immune tolerance in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Decline in honey bee colonies possess a serious threat to biodiversity and agriculture. Prior detection of the stresses with the help of biomarkers and their management ensures honey bees survivability. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a promising biomarker to monitor exposure of honey bees towards environmental pollutants. In this preliminary study, we measured AChE activity in forager honey bees collected from six districts of Nepal, Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, Chitwan, Rupandehi and Pyuthan during autumn and winter seasons. We estimated AChE tissue and specific activities from bees heads using commercial kit based on Ellman assay and protein concentration using Lowry assay. In total, we collected 716 foragers belonging to A. cerana, A. mellifera and A. dorsata. A significant increase in all three parameters measured: AChE tissue activity, AChE specific activity and protein concentration was observed in winter samples. Both AChE tissue and specific activities were lower in A. mellifera compared to either A. cerana or A. dorsata. Protein concentration was higher in A. mellifera than in A. dorsata and lower than in A. cerana. We show correlation between both AChE tissue and specific activities and protein concentration across season and species and discuss possible factors contributing to the observations. Our results clearly indicate the presence of stress in the winter which is manifested through overexpression of the AChE. We recommend a detailed study to determine the factors accountable for the stresses for better management of honey bees in Nepal.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian olfactory receptors (ORs) are a diverse family of genes encoding proteins that directly interact with environmental chemical cues. ORs evolve via gene duplication in a birth-death fashion, neofunctionalizing and pseudogenizing over time. Olfaction is a primary sense used for food detection in plant-visiting bats, but the relationship between dietary specialization and OR repertoires is unclear. Within neotropical Leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae), many lineages are plant specialists, and some have a distinct OR repertoire compared to insectivorous species. Yet, whether specialization on particular plant genera is associated with the evolution of more specialized OR repertoires has never been tested. Using targeted sequence capture, we sequenced the OR repertoires of three sympatric species of short-tailed leaf-nosed bats (Carollia), which vary in their degree of specialization on the fruits of Piper plants. We characterized orthologous versus duplicated receptors among Carollia species, and identified orthologous receptors and associated paralogs to explore the diversity and redundancy of the receptor gene repertoire. The most dedicated Piper specialist, Carollia castanea, had lower OR diversity compared to the two more generalist species (sowelli, perspicillata), but we discovered a few unique sets of ORs within C. castanea with exceptional redundancy of similar gene duplicates. These unique receptors potentially enable C. castanea to detect Piper fruit odorants to an extent that the other species cannot. C. perspicillata, the species with the most generalist diet, had a larger diversity of functional receptors, suggesting the ability to detect a wider range of odorant molecules. The variation among ORs may be a factor in the coexistence of these sympatric species, facilitating the exploitation of different plant resources. Our study sheds light on how gene duplication plays a role in dietary adaptations and underlies patterns of ecological interactions between bats and plants.\n\nImpact Statement--though it asks for 3-4 sentencesThe sense of smell is essential to how many animals detect food, yet few studies have demonstrated how dietary evolution has shaped olfactory receptor genes, which encode proteins that bind to environmental scent cues, including food odorants. We compared the evolutionary history of olfactory receptor repertoires in three co-occurring neotropical bat species along a spectrum of dietary specialization on the fruits of Piper plants. We found the more generalist species possessed a more diverse olfactory receptor profile, potentially reflecting an ability to detect more diverse arrays of fruit scent compounds, while the specialist had a narrower profile that demonstrated more redundancy. By introducing creative approaches to measure diversity in large gene families and connecting diet specialization and molecular diversity, this study makes an unprecedented contribution to evolutionary biology.",

The pleiotropic pattern of hht phenotypes is explained by progressive loss of wild-type maternal pola2 function in homozygous mutant embryos whose pola2 mRNA becomes undetectable by 24 hours post-fertilization (hpf). Inhibition of DNA synthesis by aphidicolin or hydroxyurea in wild-type embryos from 24 hpf phenocopied the pleiotropic pattern of hht.

Traditionally, rg is studied on a global scale, considering only the average of the shared signal across the genome; though this approach may fail to detect scenarios where the rg is confined to particular genomic regions, or show opposing directions at different loci. Tools dedicated to local rg analysis have started to emerge, but are currently restricted to analysis of two phenotypes. For this reason, we have developed LAVA, an integrated framework for local rg analysis which, in addition to testing the standard bivariate local rgs between two traits, can evaluate the local heritability for all traits of interest, and analyse conditional genetic relations between several traits using partial correlation or multiple regression. Applied to 20 behavioural and health phenotypes, we show considerable heterogeneity in the bivariate local rgs across the genome, which is often masked by the global rg patterns, and demonstrate how our conditional approaches can elucidate more complex, multivariate genetic relations between traits.",

Practically, high-resolution characterization of biological samples such as cell populations can provide insights into the sources of variance in biomarker expression, drug resistance, and other phenotypic aspects, but it is still unclear what is the best method for extracting this information from large image-based datasets. We present a software pipeline and comparison of multiple image segmentation methods to extract single-cell morphological and fluorescence quantitation from time lapse images of clonal growth rates using a recently reported microfluidic system. The inputs in all pipelines consist of thousands of unprocessed images and the outputs are the detection of cell counts, chamber identifiers, and individual morphological properties of each clone over time detected through multi-channel fluorescence and bright field imaging. Our conclusion is that unsupervised learning methods for cell segmentation substantially outperform supervised statistical methods with respect to accuracy and have key advantages including individual cell instance detection and flexibility through model training.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the second frequently diagnosed cancer type and responsible for the highest number of cancer deaths worldwide. Lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma are subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer which has the highest frequency of lung cancer cases. We aimed to analyze genomic and transcriptomic variations including simple nucleotide variations (SNVs), copy number variations (CNVs) and differential expressed genes (DEGs) in order to find key genes and pathways for diagnostic and prognostic prediction for lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma. We performed univariate cox model and then lasso regularized cox model with leave-one-out cross-validation using TCGA gene expression data in tumor samples. We generated a 35-gene signature and a 33-gene signature for prognostic risk prediction based on the overall survival time of the patients with LUAD and LUSC, respectively. When we clustered patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, the survival analysis showed highly significant results with high prediction power for both training and test datasets. Then we characterized the differences including significant SNVs, CNVs, DEGs, active subnetworks, and the pathways. We described the results for the risk groups and cancer subtypes separately to identify specific genomic alterations between both high-risk groups and cancer subtypes. Both LUAD and LUSC high-risk groups have more down-regulated immune pathways and upregulated metabolic pathways. On the other hand, low-risk groups have both upregulated and downregulated genes on cancer-related pathways. Both LUAD and LUSC have important gene alterations such as CDKN2A and CDKN2B deletions with different frequencies. SOX2 amplification occurs in LUSC and PSMD4 amplification in LUAD. EGFR and KRAS mutations are mutually exclusive in LUAD samples. EGFR, MGA, SMARCA4, ATM, RBM10, and KDM5C genes are mutated only in LUAD but not in LUSC. CDKN2A, PTEN, and HRAS genes are mutated only in LUSC samples. Low-risk groups of both LUAD and LUSC, tend to have a higher number of SNVs, CNVs, and DEGs. The signature genes and altered genes have the potential to be used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for personalized oncology.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe high incidence of bacterial genes that confer resistance to last-resort antibiotics, such as colistin caused by MCR genes, poses an unprecedented threat to our civilizations health. To understand the spread, evolution, and distribution of such genes among human populations, with the final goal of diminishing their occurrence in human environments should be a priority. To tackle this problem, we investigated the distribution and prevalence of potential mcr genes in the human gut microbiome we used a set of bioinformatics tools to screen the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) collection for the presence, synteny and phylogeny of putative mcr genes, and co-located antibiotic resistance genes.\n\nResultsA total of 2,079 ARGs were classified as different MCR in 2,046 Metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs), present in 1,596 individuals from 41 countries, of which 215 MCRs were identified in plasmidial contigs. The genera that presented the largest number of MCR-like genes were Suterella and Parasuterella, prevalent human gut bacteria of which Suterella wadsworthensis is associated with autism. Other potential pathogens carrying MCR genes belonged to the genus Vibrio, Escherichia and Campylobacter. Finally, we identified a total of 22,746 ARGs belonging to 21 different classes in the same 2,046 MAGs, suggesting multi-resistance potential in the corresponding bacterial strains, increasing the concern of ARGs impact in the clinical settings.\n\nConclusionThis study uncovers the diversity of MCR-like genes in the human gut microbiome. We showed the cosmopolitan distribution of these genes in individuals worldwide and the co-presence of other antibiotic resistance genes, including Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). Also, we described mcr-like genes fused to a PAP2-like domain in S. wadsworthensis. Although these novel sequences increase our knowledge about the diversity and evolution of mcr-like genes, their activity and a potential colistin resistance in the corresponding strains has to be experimentally validated.",

    "abstract": "Schwannomas are common sporadic nervous system tumors and diagnostic features of familial neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) that develop predominantly on cranial and spinal nerves and cause severe neurological deficits and significant morbidity. Virtually all schwannomas result from inactivation of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene with few, if any, cooperating mutations. Despite their genetic uniformity schwannomas exhibit remarkable clinical and therapeutic heterogeneity, which has impeded the success of early rational therapies. An understanding of how heterogeneity develops in NF2-mutant schwannomas is critically needed to improve therapeutic options for these patients. We have found that loss of the membrane:actin cytoskeleton-associated NF2 tumor suppressor protein, merlin, yields unstable intrinsic polarity and enables Nf2-/- Schwann cells to adopt distinct programs of coordinated ErbB ligand production and polarized signaling, suggesting a self-generated model of schwannoma heterogeneity. We validated the heterogeneous distribution of biomarkers of these programs in human schwannoma tissue and took advantage of the synchronous development of multiple lesions in a well-studied mouse model to establish a quantitative pipeline that can be used to study how schwannoma heterogeneity evolves and impacts nerve function and therapeutic response in mouse, and ultimately human schwannomas. Our studies inform a mounting appreciation that intrinsic mechanisms are major contributors to heterogeneity across many human cancers.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional terminators signal where transcribing RNA polymerases (RNAPs) should halt and disassociate from DNA. However, because termination is stochastic, two different forms of transcript could be produced: one ending at the terminator and the other reading through. An ability to control the abundance of these transcript isoforms would offer bioengineers a mechanism to regulate multi-gene constructs at the level of transcription. Here, we explore this possibility by repurposing terminators as  transcriptional valves which can tune the proportion of RNAP read-through. Using one-pot combinatorial DNA assembly we construct 1183 transcriptional valves for T7 RNAP and show how nanopore-based direct RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) can be used to simultaneously characterize the entire pool at a nucleotide resolution in vitro and unravel genetic design principles to tune and insulate their function using nearby sequence context. This work provides new avenues for controlling transcription and demonstrates the value of long-read sequencing for exploring complex sequence-function landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Despite substantial progress in the quest of demystifying the brain basis of creativity, several questions remain open. One such issue concerns the relationship between two latent cognitive modes during creative thinking, i.e., deliberate goal-directed cognition and spontaneous thought generation. Although an interplay between deliberate and spontaneous thinking is often indirectly implicated in the creativity literature (e.g., dual-process models), a bottom-up data-driven validation of the cognitive processes associated with creative thinking is still lacking. Here, we attempted to capture the latent modes of creative thinking by utilizing a data-driven approach on a novel continuous multitask paradigm (CMP) that widely sampled a hypothetical two-dimensional cognitive plane of deliberate and spontaneous thinking in a single fMRI session. The CMP consisted of eight task blocks ranging from undirected mind wandering to goal-directed working memory task, while also including two of the widely used creativity tasks, i.e., alternate uses task (AUT) and remote association task (RAT). Using data-driven eigen-connectivity (EC) analysis on the multitask whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) patterns, we embedded the multitask FCs into a low-dimensional latent space. The first two latent components, as revealed by the EC analysis, broadly mapped onto the two cognitive modes of deliberate and spontaneous thinking, respectively. Further, in this low-dimensional space, both creativity tasks were located in the upper right corner of high deliberate and spontaneous thinking (creative cognitive space). Neuroanatomically, the creative cognitive space was represented by not only increased intra-network connectivity within executive control and default mode networks, but also by a higher inter-network coupling between the two. Further, individual differences reflected in the low-dimensional connectivity embeddings were related to differences in deliberate and spontaneous thinking abilities. Altogether, using a continuous multitask paradigm and data-driven approach, we provide direct empirical evidence for the contribution of both deliberate and spontaneous modes of cognition during creative thinking.",

    "abstract": "In this study we show a reproduction of the dress-ambiguity phenomenon in a real scene and we report quantitative measurements of the corresponding colour perceptions. The original, real dress, known from #thedress-illusion, was illuminated by combined short- and longwavelength broadband lights from two slide projectors. Test subjects viewing the dress reported to perceive the dress fabric and lace colours as blue & black, white & gold or light blue & brown; their corresponding perceptual matches were distributed along the blue/yellow cardinal axis, and exhibited a variability comparable to the ambiguity of the dress photograph. It is particularly noteworthy that the colour ambiguity emerged despite explicit knowledge of the observers about the direction of the light source. Manipulating the background of the real dress (change in chromaticity and luminance, or masking) revealed significant differences between the perceptual groups regarding lightness and colour of the dress. Our findings suggest that observer specific differences in the perceptual organisation of the visual scene are responsible for the colour ambiguity observed for the real dress; in particular, we conclude that colour computations of white & gold viewers focused onto the local region of the dress, whereas the colour processes of blue & black and light-blue & brown viewers were strongly influenced by contextual computations including the background. Our segmentation hypothesis extends existing explanations for the dress ambiguity and proposes image based (in the case of the real scene) and high level (in the case of the photograph) neural processes which control the spatial reach of contextual colour computations. The relation between the ambiguity in our real scene and the dress photograph is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Osteoclasts are large multinucleated cells that resorb bone to regulate bone remodelling during skeletal maintenance and development. It is overlooked that osteoclasts also digest cartilage during this process, as well as in degradative conditions including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and primary bone sarcomas such as giant cell tumour of bone. This study explores the poorly understood mechanisms behind the interaction between osteoclasts and cartilage. Morphologically, osteoclasts differentiated on acellular human cartilage formed multinucleated cells expressing characteristic osteoclast marker genes (e.g. CTSK, MMP9) and proteins (TRAP, VNR) that visibly damaged the cartilage surface by SEM, but without the formation of resorption pits. Osteoclasts caused increased glycosaminoglycan (GAG) release from acellular and cellular human cartilage that was dependent on direct contact with the substrate. Direct co-culture with chondrocytes during osteoclast differentiation increased the number of large osteoclasts formed. When osteoclasts were cultured on dentine, direct co-culture with chondrocytes inhibited osteoclast formation and reduced basal degradation of cartilage. This suggests a mutually protective effect on their  native tissue between bone-resident osteoclasts and chondrocytes, that is reversed when the joint structure breaks down and osteoclasts are in contact with non-native substrates. Mechanistically, osteoclast-mediated cartilage degradation was inhibited by the pan-MMP inhibitor GM6001 and by TIMP1, indicative of a role for soluble MMPs. RNA sequencing and RT-qPCR analysis identified MMP8 as overexpressed in osteoclasts differentiated on cartilage versus dentine, while MMP9 was the most highly expressed MMP on both substrates. Inhibition of either MMP8 or MMP9 by siRNA in mature osteoclasts reduced GAG release, confirming their involvement in cartilage degradation. Immunohistochemical expression of MMP8 and MMP9 was evident in osteoclasts in osteosarcoma tissue sections. Understanding and controlling the activity of osteoclasts might represent a new therapeutic approach for pathologies characterized by cartilage degeneration and presents an attractive target for further research.",

The Cas9 CRISPR system isolated from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpyCas9) is classified as class II, which is popular due to high efficiency and robustness. Antibodies that specifically detect SpyCas9 could expand the applicability of this enzyme. Here, we report on the development of monoclonal antibodies against SpyCas9. Four hybridoma cells were selected for their expression of anti-SpyCas9. Hybridoma supernatant contained reactive and highly specific antibodies to SpyCas9. Anti-SpyCas9 antibody was purified and was non-selective against six other bacterial Cas9 proteins. SpyCas9 protein could be detected in HEK293T cells in decreasing amounts over a 48 hour period, indicating the antibody could be used to detect residual levels of SpyCas9 remaining following cell treatment with a CRISPR/SpyCas9 system. The anti-SpyCas9 antibody may help researchers facilitate Cas9 for further study for the use of techniques such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunohistochemical staining.",
