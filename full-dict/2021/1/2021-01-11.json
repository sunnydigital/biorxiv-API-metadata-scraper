    "abstract": "Heme, a porphyrin ring complexed with iron, is a metalloprosthetic group of numerous proteins involved in diverse metabolic and respiratory processes across all domains of life, and is thus considered essential for respiring organisms1,2. Several microbial groups are known to lack the de novo heme biosynthetic pathway and therefore require exogenous heme from the environment3. These heme auxotroph groups are largely limited to pathogens4,5, symbionts6,7, or microorganisms living in nutrient-replete conditions8, whereas the complete absence of heme biosynthesis is extremely rare in free-living organisms9. Here, we show that the acI lineage, a predominant and ubiquitous free-living bacterial group in freshwater habitats, is auxotrophic for heme. We found that two recently cultivated acI isolates10 require exogenous heme for their growth. According to whole-genome analyses, all (n=20) isolated acI strains lacked essential enzymes necessary for heme biosynthesis, indicating that heme auxotrophy is a conserved trait in this lineage. Analyses of >24,000 representative genomes for species clusters of the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) revealed that heme auxotrophy is widespread across abundant but not-yet-cultivated microbial groups, including Patescibacteria, Marinisomatota (SAR406), Actinomarinales (OM1), and marine group III Euryarchaeota. Our findings indicate that heme auxotrophy is a more common phenomenon than previously thought, and may lead to use of heme as a growth factor to increase the cultured microbial diversity.",

    "abstract": "Climate warming changes the phenology of many species. When interacting organisms respond differently, climate change may disrupt their interactions and affect the stability of ecosystems. Here, we used GBIF occurrence records to examine phenology trends in plants and their associated insect pollinators in Germany since the 1980s. We found strong phenological advances in plants, but differences in the extent of shifts among pollinator groups. The temporal trends in plant and insect phenologies were generally associated with interannual temperature variation, and thus likely driven by climate change. When examining the synchrony of species-level plant-pollinator interactions, their temporal trends differed among pollinator groups. Overall, plant-pollinator interactions become more synchronized, mainly since the phenology of plants responded more strongly to climate change than that of the pollinators. However, if the observed trends continue, many interactions may become more asynchronous again in the future. Our study suggests that climate change affects the phenologies of both plants and insects, and that it also influences the synchrony of plant-pollinator interactions.",

    "abstract": "Cancers evade the immune system in order to grow or metastasise through the process of cancer immunoediting. While immune checkpoint inhibitors have been effective for reactivating tumour immunity in some types of cancer, many other solid cancers, including breast cancer, remain largely non-responsive. Understanding the way non-responsive cancers evolve to evade immunity, what resistance pathways are activated and whether this occurs at the clonal level will improve immunotherapeutic design. We tracked cancer cell clones during the immunoediting process and determined clonal transcriptional profiles that allow immune evasion in murine mammary tumour growth in response to immunotherapy with anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4. Clonal diversity was significantly restricted by immunotherapy treatment in both primary tumours and metastases. These findings demonstrate that immunoediting selects for pre-existing breast cancer cell populations and that immunoediting is not static, it is ongoing during metastasis and immunotherapy treatment. Isolation of immunotherapy resistant clones revealed unique and overlapping transcriptional signatures. The overlapping gene signature was associated with poor survival of basal-like breast cancer patients in two cohorts. At least one of these overlapping genes has an existing small molecule that can potentially be used to improve immunotherapy response.",

    "abstract": "Background & Aims24-NorUrsodeoxycholic acid (NorUDCA) is novel therapy for immune-mediated liver diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) where dysregulated T cells including CD8+ T cells cause liver immunopathology. We hypothesized that NorUDCA may directly modulate CD8+ T cell effector function thus contributing to its therapeutic efficacy independent of anti-cholestatic effects.\n\nMethodsNorUDCA effects on CD8+ T cell function in vivo were investigated in a hepatic injury model system induced by excessive CD8+ T cell immune response upon non-cytolytic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. Mechanistic studies included molecular and biochemical approaches, flow cytometry and metabolic assays in mouse CD8+ T cells in vitro. Mass spectrometry (MS) was used to identify potential targets modulated by NorUDCA in CD8+ T cells. NorUDCA signaling effects observed in murine systems were validated in peripheral T cells from healthy volunteers and PSC patients.\n\nResultsIn vivo NorUDCA ameliorated hepatic injury and systemic inflammation upon LCMV infection. Mechanistically, NorUDCA demonstrated a strong immunomodulatory efficacy in CD8+ T cells affecting lymphoblastogenesis, mTORC1 signaling and glycolysis of CD8+ T cells. With MS, we identified that NorUDCA regulates CD8+ T cells via targeting mTORC1. NorUDCAs impact on mTORC1 signaling was further confirmed in circulating human CD8+ T cells.\n\nConclusionsNorUDCA possesses a yet-unrecognized direct modulatory potency on CD8+ T cells and attenuates excessive CD8+ T cell hepatic immunopathology. These findings may be relevant for treatment of immune-mediated liver diseases such as PSC and beyond.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveErythritol is both a common non-nutritive sweetener (NNS) and an endogenous product of glucose metabolism. Recent reports indicate that elevated plasma erythritol is a predictive biomarker of cardiometabolic disease onset and complications. Although short-term erythritol consumption has been evaluated, the effect of chronically elevated circulating erythritol on adiposity and glucose metabolism has not. This study investigated the effect of longer-term erythritol consumption on weight gain and glucose tolerance, and the interaction between dietary composition and erythritol supplementation on these parameters.\n\nMethods8-week-old and 20-week-old C57BL/6J mice were randomized to consume low-fat diet (LFD), high-fat diet (HFD), LFD with 40g/kg erythritol (LFD+ERY), and HFD with 40g/kg erythritol (HFD+ERY) groups. After 8 weeks, plasma erythritol, body weight and composition, food intake, glucose tolerance, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression were measured.\n\nResultsPlasma erythritol was elevated 40-fold in mice consuming LFD+ERY or HFD+ERY relative to mice consuming LFD or HFD, respectively. Liver and kidney tissue contained higher levels of erythritol than adipose. Unexpectedly, there was no effect of erythritol supplementation on body weight or glucose tolerance in 8- or 20-week-old mice fed LFD+ERY, or in 8-week-old mice fed HFD+ERY. In 20-week-old mice fed HFD+ERY, there was a significant interaction between erythritol and body weight (p<0.0001) compared to controls, but the main effect of diet was not significant. We also found no effect of chronic erythritol consumption on BAT UCP1 expression.\n\nConclusionProlonged erythritol consumption did not significantly impact body weight, composition, or glucose tolerance. This suggests that dietary erythritol does not contribute to the development of cardiometabolic disease.",

    "abstract": "Science fairs offer potential opportunities for students to learn first-hand about the practices of science. Over the past six years we have been carrying out voluntary and anonymous surveys with regional and national groups of high school and post high school students to learn about their high school science fair experiences regarding help received, obstacles encountered, and opinions about the value and impact of science fair. Understanding what students think about science fairs will help educators make science fairs more effective learning opportunities. In this paper, we focus on the findings with two national groups of post high school students - undergraduate research fellows (SURF students) who did research at UT Southwestern Medical Center during 2014-2019 and undergraduates biology students attending the 2019 Howard Hughes Medical Institute Science Education Alliance (SEA) summer symposium. About 25% of the students who completed surveys indicated that they had participated in high school science fair, but more than half attended high schools where science fairs were unavailable. Effectively, 6 out of every 10 students participated in science fair if available. Students who could have participated in high school science fair but chose not to do so identified not enough time and coming up with their project idea as major reasons why not. About half the SURF students favored requiring non-competitive science fair regardless whether they themselves had participated in science fair. On the other hand, less than 1 in 5 thought that competitive science fair should be required. Introduction to the scientific process and general learning were mentioned most frequently as the reasons to require non-competitive science fair; these reasons were mentioned rarely in connection with competitive science fair. Unlike the national cohort of high school students we surveyed previously, who mostly did science fair in 9th and 10th grades, SURF students participated in science fair throughout high school and were twice as likely as high school students to have carried out science fair more than once. In conclusion, our findings suggest that participation of the undergraduate bioscience majors in high school science fairs occurs far more frequently than recognized previously. The findings emphasize further the importance of incentivizing rather than requiring science fair participation, especially in 9th and 10th grades, and the potential value of developing non-competitive science fairs.",

As immunotherapies improve, the long standing biological interest in connecting outcome with T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire status has become more urgent. Here we show that new insights can be extracted from high throughput repertoire sequencing data. Most current efforts focus on identification of immunisation-specific sequence motifs or on monitoring changes in frequency of individual clones. Applying TCRDivER to murine spleen samples shows it characterises an additional dimension of repertoire variation, beyond conventional diversity estimates, allowing distinction between immunised and non-immunised samples. We further apply TCRDivER to repertoires from human blood. In both cases we show characteristic relationships between repertoire features. These reveal biologically interpretable relationships between sequence similarity and clonal expansions. We thereby demonstrate a new tool for investigation in clinical and research applications.",

    "abstract": "The successful application of Saccharomyces eubayanus and Saccharomyces paradoxus in brewery fermentations has highlighted the potential of wild yeast for brewing, and prompted investigation into the application potential of other members of the genus. Here, we evaluate, for the first time, the brewing potential of Saccharomyces jurei. The newly isolated strain from an ash tree (Fraxinus excelsior) in Upper Bavaria, Germany, close to the river Isar, was used to ferment a 12{degrees}P wort at 15{degrees}C. Performance was compared directly with that of a reference lager strain (TUM 34/70) and the S. eubayanus type strain. Both wild yeast rapidly depleted simple sugars and thereafter exhibited a lag phase before maltose utilization. This phase lasted for 4 and 10 days for S. eubayanus and S. jurei, respectively. S. eubayanus utilized fully the available maltose but, consistent with previous reports, did not use maltotriose. S. jurei, in contrast, utilized approx. 50% of the maltotriose available, making this the first report of maltotriose utilization in a wild Saccharomyces species. Maltotriose use was directly related to alcohol yield with 5.5, 4.9, and 4.5 % ABV produced by S. pastorianus, S. jurei and S. eubayanus. Beers also differed with respect to aroma volatiles, with a high level (0.4 mg/L) of the apple/aniseed aroma ethyl hexanoate in S. jurei beers, while S. eubayanus beers had a high level of phenylethanol (100 mg/L). A trained panel rated all beers as being of high quality, but noted clear differences. A phenolic spice/clove note was prominent in S. jurei beer. This was less pronounced in the S. eubayanus beers, despite analytical levels of 4-vinylguaiacol being similar. Tropical fruit notes were pronounced in S. jurei beers, possibly resulting from the high level of ethyl hexanoate. Herein, we present the successful results of the first intentional application of S. jurei as a yeast for beer fermentation known to us and compare its fermentation performance to other species of the genus. Results indicate considerable potential for S. jurei application in brewing, with clear advantages compared to other wild Saccharomyces species.",

Staphylococcus sp. strain AOAB was isolated from the stomodeum (gut) of the Mnemiopsis leidyi from Mobile Bay, Alabama USA. A polyphasic taxonomic approach comprised of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic characteristics was used for analysis. The dominant respiratory quinone detected was MK-7 (100%). Major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0 (40.52%), anteiso-C17:0 (13.04 %), C-18:0 (11.53%) and C-20:0 (10.45%). The polar lipid profile consisted of glycolipid, phospholipid, phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol. Although strain AOAB had a 16SrRNA gene sequence similarity of 99% with S. warneri SG1, S. pasteuri, S. devriesei KS-SP_60, S. lugdunensis HKU09-01, S. epidermidis RP62A, S. haemolyticus JCSC1435 and S. hominis DM 122, it was be distinguished from those species based on Multi-Locus Sequence Analysis (MLSA) using 6 marker genes (16S rRNA, hsp60, rpoB, dnaJ, sodA and tuf). MLSA revealed strain AOAB to be closely related to S. warneri SG1 and S. pasteuri SP1 but distinct from two hitherto known species. These results were confirmed by Average Nucleotide Identity (closest ANI of 84.93% and 84.58% identity against S. warneri SG1 and S. pasteuri SP1 respectively). In-silico DNA-DNA hybridization was <70% (33.1 % and 32.8% against S. warneri SG1 and S. pasteuri SP1 respectively), which further confirmed that the strain was a potential novel Staphylococcus species.",

    "abstract": "A main clinical parameter of COVID-19 pathophysiology is hypoxia. Here we show that hypoxia decreases the attachment of the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the S1 subunit (S1) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to epithelial cells. In Vero E6 cells, hypoxia reduces the protein levels of ACE2 and neuropilin-1 (NRP1), which might in part explain the observed reduction of the infection rate. In addition, hypoxia inhibits the binding of the spike to NCI-H460 human lung epithelial cells by decreasing the cell surface levels of heparan sulfate (HS), a known attachment receptor of SARS-CoV-2. This interaction is also reduced by lactoferrin, a glycoprotein that blocks HS moieties on the cell surface. The expression of syndecan-1, an HS-containing proteoglycan expressed in lung, is inhibited by hypoxia on a HIF-1-dependent manner. Hypoxia or deletion of syndecan-1 results in reduced binding of the RBD to host cells. Our study indicates that hypoxia acts to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the hypoxia signaling pathway might offer therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is protective against external oncogenic stress, but its accumulation causes aging-related diseases. Forkhead box O4 (FOXO4) and p53 are human transcription factors known to promote senescence by interacting each other and activating p21 transcription. Inhibition of the interaction is a strategy for inducing apoptosis of senescent cells, but the binding surfaces that mediate the FOXO4-p53 interaction remain elusive. Here, we investigated two binding sites involved in the interaction between FOXO4 and p53 by NMR spectroscopy. NMR chemical shift perturbation analysis showed that the binding between FOXO4s forkhead domain (FHD) and p53s transactivation domain (TAD), and between FOXO4s C-terminal transactivation domain (CR3) and p53s DNA binding domain (DBD), mediate the FOXO4-p53 interaction. Isothermal titration calorimetry data showed that both interactions have micromolar Kd values, and FOXO4 FHD-p53 TAD interaction has a higher binding affinity. Also, we showed that the FOXO4 CR3-binding surface of FOXO4 FHD interacts with p53 TAD2, and FOXO4 CR3 interacts with the DNA/p53 TAD-binding surface of p53 DBD, suggesting a network of potentially competitive and/or coordinated interactions. Based on the results, we propose that the dual interaction contributes to two TFs proper location on the p21 promoter site and consequently promotes p21 transcription and cell senescence. This work provides structural information at the molecular level that is key to understanding the interplay of two proteins responsible for cellular senescence.\n\nConflicts of interestNone",

    "abstract": "Porphyrias are caused by genetic defects in the heme biosynthetic pathway and are associated with accumulation of high levels of porphyrins that become cytotoxic. Porphyrins, due to their amphipathic nature, spontaneously associate into different nanostructures but very little is known about the effect of porphyrin speciation on the cytotoxic effects of porphyrins. Previously we demonstrated the unique ability of fluorescent biological porphyrins, including protoporphyrin IX (PP-IX), to cause organelle selective protein aggregation, which we posit to be a major mechanism by which porphyrins exerts their cytotoxic effect. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that PP-IX-mediated protein aggregation is modulated by different PP-IX nanostructures via a mechanism that depends on their oxidizing potential and protein binding ability. We demonstrate that PP-IX nanostructure formation is reversible in nature, and that nanostructure size modulates consequent protein oxidation and aggregation potential. We also show that albumin, the most abundant serum protein, preferentially binds PP-IX dimers and enhances their oxidizing ability. Additionally, extracellular albumin protects from intracellular porphyrinogenic stress and protein aggregation by acting as a PP-IX sponge. This work highlights the importance of PP-IX speciation in the context of the porphyrias, and offers insights into potential novel therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Numerous antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, and these generally target either the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the viral spike. While RBD-directed antibodies have been extensively studied, far less is known about NTD-directed antibodies. Here we report cryo-EM and crystal structures for seven potent NTD-directed neutralizing antibodies in complex with spike or isolated NTD. These structures defined several antibody classes, with at least one observed in multiple convalescent donors. The structures revealed all seven antibodies to target a common surface, bordered by glycans N17, N74, N122, and N149. This site - formed primarily by a mobile {beta}-hairpin and several flexible loops - was highly electropositive, located at the periphery of the spike, and the largest glycan-free surface of NTD facing away from the viral membrane. Thus, in contrast to neutralizing RBD-directed antibodies that recognize multiple non-overlapping epitopes, potent NTD-directed neutralizing antibodies target a single supersite.",

    "abstract": "Oligomannoses are evolutionarily the oldest class of N-glycans, where the arms of the common pentasaccharide unit, i.e. Man 1-6)-[Man(1-3)]-Man{beta}(1-4)-GlcNAc{beta}(1-4)-GlcNAc{beta}1-Asn, are functionalized exclusively with branched arrangements of mannose (Man) monosaccharide units. In mammalian species oligomannose N-glycans can have up to 9 Man, meanwhile structures can grow to over 200 units in yeast mannan. The highly dynamic nature, branching complexity and 3D structure of oligomannoses have been recently highlighted for their roles in immune escape and infectivity of enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1 and SARS-CoV2. The architectural features that allow these N-glycans to perform their functions is yet unclear, due to their intrinsically disordered nature that hinders their structural characterization. In this work we will discuss the results of over 54 {micro}s of cumulative sampling by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of differently processed, free (not protein-linked) oligomannose N-glycans common in vertebrates. We then discuss the effects of a protein surface on their structural equilibria based on over 4 {micro}s cumulative MD sampling of the fully glycosylated CD16a Fc gamma receptor (Fc{gamma}RIIIa), where the type of glycosylation is known to modulate its binding affinity for IgG1s, regulating the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Our results show that the proteins structural constraints shift the oligomannoses conformational ensemble to promote conformers that satisfy the steric requirements and hydrogen bonding networks demanded by the proteins surface landscape. More importantly, we find that the protein does not actively distort the N-glycans into structures not populated in the unlinked forms in solution. Ultimately, the highly populated conformations of the Man5 linked glycans support experimental evidence of high levels of hybrid complex forms at N45 and show a specific presentation of the arms at N162, which may be involved in mediating binding affinity to the IgG1 Fc.",

    "abstract": "Since the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as the causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic, considerable effort has been spent characterizing the interaction between the Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. This has provided a detailed picture of the end point structure of the RBD-ACE2 binding event, but what remains to be elucidated is the conformation and dynamics of the RBD prior to its interaction with ACE2. In this work we utilize molecular dynamics simulations to probe the flexibility and conformational ensemble of the unbound state of the receptor-binding domain from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We have found that the unbound RBD has a localized region of dynamic flexibility in Loop 3 and that mutations identified during the COVID-19 pandemic in Loop 3 do not affect this flexibility. We use a loop-modeling protocol to generate and simulate novel conformations of the CoV2-RBD Loop 3 region that sample conformational space beyond the ACE2 bound crystal structure. This has allowed for the identification of interesting substates of the unbound RBD that are lower energy than the ACE2-bound conformation, and that block key residues along the ACE2 binding interface. These novel unbound substates may represent new targets for therapeutic design.",

    "abstract": "Targeting apoptosis is a promising approach to inhibit the abnormal cell proliferation of cancer progression. Existing anti-apoptotic drugs, many derived from chemical substances, have often failed to combat cancer development and progression. Therefore, identification of apoptosis-inducing anticancer agents from plant-derived sources has become a key aim in cancer research. The present study was designed to explore the regulation of apoptosis by Tabebuia pallida (T. pallida) using an Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) mouse model and compositional analysis by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Dried and powdered T. pallida leaves (TPL), stem bark (TPSB), root bark (TPRB) and flowers (TPF) were extracted with 80% methanol. Using cultured EAC cells and EAC-bearing mice with and without these extracts, anticancer activities were studied by assessing cytotoxicity and tumor cell growth inhibition, changes in life span of mice, and hematological and biochemical parameters. Apoptosis was analyzed by microscopy and expression of selected apoptosis-related genes (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, NF{kappa}-B, PARP-1, p53, Bax, caspase-3 and -8) using RT-PCR. LC-ESI-MS analysis was performed to identify the major compounds from the most active extracts. In EAC mice compared with untreated controls, the TPL extract exhibited the highest cytotoxicity with significant tumor cell growth inhibition (p< 0.001), reduced ascites by body weight (p< 0.01), increased the life span (p<0.001), normalized blood parameters (RBC/WBC counts), and increased the levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase. TPL-treated EAC cells showed apoptotic characteristics of membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation, compared with untreated EAC cells. Moreover, annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide signals were greatly enhanced in response to TPL treatment, indicating apoptosis induction. Pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling after TPL treatment demonstrated up-regulated p53, Bax and PARP-1, and down-regulated NF{kappa}-B, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression, suggesting that TPL shifts the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes towards cell death. LC-ESI-MS data of TPL showed a mixture of glycosides, lapachol, and quercetin antioxidant and its derivatives that were significantly linked to cancer cell targets. In conclusion, the TPL extract of T. pallida possesses significant anticancer activity. The tumor suppressive mechanism is due to apoptosis induced by activation of antioxidant enzymes and caspases and mediated by a change in the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes that promotes cell death.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/426226v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1112faaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1505d1dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1115a2aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@36a915_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The recombinant (r)NDV-S vaccine expressing spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 administrated via intranasal route in mice induced high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG2a antibodies and T cell-mediated immunity. Hamsters vaccinated with two doses of vaccine showed complete protection from clinical disease including lung infection, inflammation, and pathological lesions after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Importantly, a single or double dose of intranasal rNDV-S vaccine completely blocked SARS-CoV-2 shedding in nasal turbinate and lungs within 4 days of vaccine administration in hamsters. Taken together, intranasal administration of rNDV-S has the potential to control infection at the site of inoculation, which should prevent both the clinical disease and transmission to halt the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

To provide insight into whether these genetic similarities inform common modes of recognition, we determined structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in complex with three VH1-2-derived antibodies: 2-15, 2-43, and H4. All three utilized VH1-2-encoded motifs to recognize the receptor-binding domain (RBD), with heavy chain N53I enhancing binding and light chain tyrosines recognizing F486RBD. Despite these similarities, class members bound both RBD-up and -down conformations of the spike, with a subset of antibodies utilizing elongated CDRH3s to recognize glycan N343 on a neighboring RBD - a quaternary interaction accommodated by an increase in RBD separation of up to 12 [A]. The VH1-2-antibody class thus utilizes modular recognition encoded by modular genetic elements to effect potent neutralization, with VH-gene component specifying recognition of RBD and CDRH3 component specifying quaternary interactions.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDetermine structures of VH1-2-derived antibodies 2-43, 2-15, and H4 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike\nC_LIO_LIDefine a multi-donor VH1-2-antibody class with modular components for RBD and quaternary recognition\nC_LIO_LIReveal structural basis of RBD-up and RBD-down recognition within the class\nC_LIO_LIShow somatic hypermutations and avidity to be critical for potency\nC_LIO_LIDelineate changes in spike conformation induced by CDRH3-mediated quaternary recognition\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as the infectious agent causing the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with dramatic consequences for global human health and economics. Previously, we reached clinical evaluation with our vector vaccine based on vaccinia virus MVA against the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which causes an infection in humans similar to SARS and COVID-19. Here, we describe the construction and preclinical characterization of a recombinant MVA expressing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (MVA-SARS-2-S). Genetic stability and growth characteristics of MVA-SARS-2-S, plus its robust synthesis of S antigen, make it a suitable candidate vaccine for industrial scale production. Vaccinated mice produced S antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and serum antibodies binding to S glycoprotein that neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Prime-boost vaccination with MVA-SARS-2-S protected mice sensitized with a human ACE2-expressing adenovirus from SARS-CoV-2 infection. MVA-SARS-2-S is currently being investigated in a phase I clinical trial as aspirant for developing a safe and efficacious vaccine against COVID-19.\n\nSignificance StatementThe highly attenuated vaccinia virus MVA is licensed as smallpox vaccine, and as vector it is a component of the approved Adenovirus-MVA-based prime-boost vaccine against Ebola virus disease. Here we provide results from testing the COVID-19 candidate vaccine MVA-SARS-2-S, a poxvirus-based vector vaccine that proceeded to clinical evaluation. When administered by intramuscular inoculation, MVA-SARS-2-S expresses and safely delivers the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, inducing balanced SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral immunity, and protective efficacy in vaccinated mice. Substantial clinical experience has already been gained with MVA vectors using homologous and heterologous prime-boost applications, including the immunization of children and immunocompromised individuals. Thus, MVA-SARS-2-S represents an important resource for developing further optimized COVID-19 vaccines.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging from South Africa (501.V2) and the UK (B.1.1.7) necessitate rapid assessment of the effects of the corresponding amino acid substitutions in the spike (S) receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the variants on the interactions with the human ACE2 receptor and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) reported earlier to neutralize the spike.\n\nResultsMolecular modeling and simulations reveal that N501Y, shared by both variants, increases ACE2 binding affinity, and may impact the collective dynamics of the ACE2-RBD complex, occupying a central hinge site that modulates the overall dynamics of the complex. In contrast, the substitutions K417N and E484K in the South African variant 501.V2 would reduce the ACE2-binding affinity by abolishing two interfacial salt bridges that facilitate RBD binding to ACE2, K417(S)-D30(ACE2) and E484 (S)-K31(ACE2). These two mutations may thus be more than compensating the attractive effect induced by N501Y, overall resulting in an ACE2-binding affinity comparable to that of the wildtype RBD. Further analysis of the impact of these mutations on the interactions with mAbs targeting the spike indicate that the substitutions K417N and E484K may also abolish the salt bridges between the spike and selected mAbs, such as REGN10933, BD23, H11_H4, and C105, thus reducing the binding affinity and effectiveness of these mAbs.\n\nContactbahar@pitt.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Although studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have provided many insights into mutagenesis and DNA repair, most of this work has focused on a few laboratory strains. Much less is known about the phenotypic effects of natural variation within S. cerevisiaes DNA repair pathways. Here, we use natural polymorphisms to detect historical mutation spectrum differences among several wild and domesticated S. cerevisiae strains. To determine whether these differences are likely caused by genetic mutation rate modifiers, we use a modified fluctuation assay with a CAN1 reporter to measure de novo mutation rates and spectra in 16 of the analyzed strains. We measure a 10-fold range of mutation rates and identify two strains with distinctive mutation spectra. These strains, known as AEQ and AAR, come from the panels \"Mosaic beer\" clade and share an enrichment for C>A mutations that is also observed in rare variation segregating throughout the genomes of several Mosaic beer and Mixed origin strains. Both AEQ and AAR are haploid derivatives of the diploid natural isolate CBS 1782, whose rare polymorphisms are enriched for C>A as well, suggesting that the underlying mutator allele is likely active in nature. We use a plasmid complementation test to show that AAR and AEQ share a mutator allele in the DNA repair gene OGG1, which excises 8-oxoguanine lesions that can cause C>A mutations if left unrepaired.",

    "abstract": "All available SARS-CoV-2 spike protein crystal and cryo-EM structures have shown missing electron densities for cytosolic C-terminal regions. Generally, the missing electron densities point towards the intrinsically disordered nature of the protein region. This curiosity has led us to investigate the C terminal cytosolic region of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in isolation. The cytosolic regions is supposed to be from 1235-1273 residues or 1242-1273 residues depending on what prediction tool we use. Therefore, we have demonstrated the structural conformation of cytosolic region and its dynamics through computer simulations up to microsecond timescale using OPLS and CHARMM forcefields. The simulations have revealed the unstructured conformation of cytosolic region. Also, in temperature dependent replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations it has shown its conformational dynamics. Further, we have validated our computational observations with circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy-based experiments and found its signature spectra at 198 nm which is also adding the analysis as its intrinsically disordered nature. We believe that our findings will surely help us understand the structure-function relationship of the spike proteins cytosolic region.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

RpoS turnover is exclusively dependent on RssB, a two-domain response regulator that functions as an adaptor that delivers RpoS to ClpXP for proteolysis. Here we report crystal structures of the receiver domain of RssB both in its unphosphorylated form and bound to the phosphomimic BeF3-. Surprisingly, we find only modest differences between these two structures, suggesting that truncating RssB may partially activate the receiver domain to a \"meta-active\" state. Our structural and sequence analysis points to RssB proteins not conforming to either the Y-T coupling scheme for signaling seen in prototypical response regulators, such as CheY, or to the signaling model of the less understood FATGUY proteins.",

    "abstract": "Antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis (AGN) is a clinical manifestation of many autoimmune kidney diseases for which few effective treatments exist. Chronic inflammatory circuits in renal glomerular and tubular cells lead to tissue damage in AGN. These cells are targeted by the cytokine IL-17, which has recently been shown to be a central driver of the pathogenesis of AGN. However, surprisingly little is known about the regulation of pathogenic IL-17 signaling in the kidney. Here, using a well characterized mouse model of AGN, we show that IL-17 signaling in renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) is necessary for AGN development. We also show that Regnase-1, an RNA binding protein with endoribonuclease activity, is a negative regulator of IL-17 signaling in RTECs. Accordingly, mice with a selective Regnase-1 deficiency in RTECs exhibited exacerbated kidney dysfunction in AGN. Mechanistically, Regnase-1 inhibits IL-17-driven expression of the transcription factor I{kappa}B{xi} and consequently its downstream gene targets including Il6 and Lcn2. Moreover, deletion of Regnase-1 in human RTECs reduced inflammatory gene expression in an I{kappa}B{xi}-dependent manner. Overall, these data identify an IL-17-driven inflammatory circuit in RTECs during AGN that is constrained by Regnase-1.",

    "abstract": "An increasingly apparent role of noncoding RNA (ncRNAs) is to coordinate gene expression when bacteria faces various environmental stressors. Salmonella enterica, a well-studied foodborne pathogen, is known for its ability to survive in and adapt to various environmental challenges, making it a difficult pathogen to eliminate, as well as an important model for examining ncRNA contributions to cellular stress survival. A mounting body of evidence implicates small RNAs (sRNAs) as key drivers of Salmonella stress response. Generally thought to be 50-500 nucleotides in length and to occur mainly in intergenic regions, sRNAs regulate protein expression through base pairing with mRNA targets. Through employing a refined definition of sRNAs that allows for shorter sequences and for sRNA loci to overlap with annotated protein-coding gene loci, we have identified 475 previously unannotated sRNAs that are significantly differentially expressed during Carbon starvation (C-starvation). Northern blotting and quantitative RT-PCRs confirm the expressions and identities of several of these novel sRNAs. Additionally, our computational analyses find the majority to be highly conserved and structurally-related to known sRNAs. Importantly, we show that deletion of one of the dynamic sRNAs, sRNA4130247, significantly impairs the Salmonella C-starvation response (CSR), confirming its involvement (and suggesting the involvements of many other sRNAs identified in this work) in the Salmonella CSR. Strikingly, the 475 novel sRNAs identified in this study more than double the number of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 sRNAs described to date, increasing the total number of annotated Salmonella sRNAs from 396 to 871. In conclusion, the work presented here provides the first-ever characterization of intragenic sRNAs in Salmonella, experimentally confirms that sRNAs dynamically expressed during the CSR are directly involved in stress survival, and strongly suggests that sRNA loci likely outnumber those of protein-coding genes in Salmonella.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic variants in MFN2 cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type 2A (CMT2A) and are the leading cause of the axonal subtypes of CMT. CMT2A is characterized by predominantly distal motor weakness and muscle atrophy, with highly variable severity and onset age. Notably, some MFN2 variants can also lead to other phenotypes such as optic atrophy, hearing loss and lipodystrophy. Despite the clear link between MFN2 and CMT2A, our mechanistic understanding of how dysfunction of the MFN2 protein causes human disease pathologies remains incomplete. This lack of understanding is due in part to the multiple cellular roles of MFN2. Though initially characterized for its role in mediating mitochondrial fusion, MFN2 also plays important roles in mediating interactions between mitochondria and other organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets. Additionally, MFN2 is also important for mitochondrial transport, mitochondrial autophagy, and has even been implicated in lipid transfer. Though over 100 pathogenic MFN2 variants have been described to date, only a few have been characterized functionally, and even then, often only for one or two functions. Here, we describe a novel homozygous MFN2 variant, D414V, in a patient presenting with cerebellar ataxia, deafness, blindness, and diffuse cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.

    "abstract": "Mendelian inheritance is a fundamental law of genetics. Considering two alleles in a diploid, a phenotype of a heterotype is dominated by a particular homotype according to the law of dominance. This picture is usually based on simple genotype-phenotype mapping in which one gene regulates one phenotype. However, in reality, some interactions between genes can result in deviation from Mendelian dominance.\n\nHere, by using the numerical evolution of diploid gene regulatory networks (GRNs), we discuss whether Mendelian dominance evolves beyond the classical case of one-to-one genotype-phenotype mapping. We examine whether complex genotype-phenotype mapping can achieve Mendelian dominance through the evolution of the GRN with interacting genes. Specifically, we extend the GRN model to a diploid case, in which two GRN matrices are added to give gene expression dynamics, and simulate evolution with meiosis and recombination. Our results reveal that Mendelian dominance evolves even under complex genotype-phenotype mapping. This dominance is achieved via a group of genotypes that differ from each other but have a common phenotype given by the expression of target genes. Calculating the degree of dominance shows that it increases through the evolution, correlating closely with the decrease in phenotypic fluctuations and the increase in robustness to initial noise. This evolution of Mendelian dominance is associated with phenotypic robustness against meiosis-induced genome mixing, whereas sexual recombination arising from the mixing of chromosomes from the parents further enhances dominance and robustness. Owing to this dominance, the robustness to genetic differences increases, while the optimal fitness is sustained up to a large difference between the two genomes. In summary, Mendelian dominance is achieved by groups of genotypes that are associated with the increase in phenotypic robustness to noise.\n\nAuthor summaryMendelian dominance is one of the most fundamental laws in genetics. When two conflicting characters occur in a single diploid, the dominant character is always chosen. Assuming that one gene makes one character, this law is simple to grasp. However, in reality, phenotypes are generated via interactions between several genes, which may alter Mendels dominance law. The evolution of robustness to noise and mutations has been investigated extensively using complex expression dynamics with gene regulatory networks. Here, we applied gene-expression dynamics with complex interactions to the case of a diploid and simulated the evolution of the gene regulatory network to generate the optimal phenotype given by a certain gene expression pattern. Interestingly, after evolution, Mendelian dominance is achieved via a group of genes. This group-based Mendelian dominance is shaped by phenotype insensitivity to genome mixing by meiosis and evolves concurrently with the robustness to noise. By focusing on the influence of phenotypic robustness, which has received considerable attention recently, our result provides a novel perspective as to why Mendels law of dominance is commonly observed.",

    "abstract": "Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) challenge of rhesus macaques (RMs) vaccinated with Rhesus Cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) vectors expressing SIV proteins (RhCMV/SIV) results in a binary outcome: stringent control and subsequent clearance of highly pathogenic SIV in ~55% of vaccinated RMs with no protection in the remaining 45%. Although previous work suggests that unconventionally restricted, SIV-specific, effector-memory (EM)-biased CD8+ T cell responses are necessary for efficacy, the magnitude of these responses does not predict efficacy, and the basis of protection vs. non-protection in RhCMV/SIV vector-vaccinated RMs has not been elucidated. Here, we report that RhCMV/SIV vector administration strikingly alters the whole blood transcriptome of vaccinated RMs, with the sustained induction of specific immune-related pathways, including non-canonical T cell receptor (TCR), toll-lie receptor (TLR), inflammasome/cell death, and interleukin-15 (IL-15) signaling, significantly predicting protection. The IL-15 gene expression signature was further evaluated in an independent RM IL-15 treatment cohort, revealing that in whole blood the response to IL-15 is inclusive of innate and adaptive immune gene expression networks that link with RhCMV/SIV vaccine efficacy. We also show that this IL-15 response signature similarly tracks with vaccine protection in an independent RhCMV/SIV vaccination/SIV challenge RM validation cohort. Thus, the RhCMV/SIV vaccine imparts a coordinated and persistent induction of innate and adaptive immune pathways featuring IL-15, a known regulator of CD8+ T cell function, that enable vaccine-elicited CD8+ T cells to mediate protection against highly pathogenic SIV challenge.\n\nAuthor SummarySIV insert-expressing vaccine vectors based on strain 68-1 RhCMV elicit robust, highly effector-memory-biased T cell responses that are associated with an unprecedented level of SIV control after challenge (replication arrest leading to clearance) in slightly over half of vaccinated monkeys. Since efficacy is not predicted by standard measures of immunogenicity, we used functional genomics analysis of RhCMV/SIV vaccinated monkeys with known challenge outcomes to identify immune correlates of protection. We found that arrest of viral replication after challenge significantly correlates with a vaccine-induced response to IL-15 that includes modulation of T cell, inflammation, TLR signaling, and cell death programming. These data suggest that RhCMV/SIV efficacy is not based on chance, but rather, results from a coordinated and sustained vaccine-mediated induction of innate and adaptive immune pathways featuring IL-15, a known regulator of CD8+ effector-memory T cell function, that enable vaccine-elicited CD8+ T cells to mediate efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) regulate levels of transcription through a complex array of protein-protein interactions, thereby controlling key physiological processes such as development, stress response and cell growth. The transcription factor HOXA11 contains an intrinsically disordered regions (IDR) through which it interacts with CREB binding protein (CBP) and regulates endometrial development and function in eutherian mammals. The interaction between the IDR of HOXA11 and CBP was analyzed using computational docking guided by experimental constraints. HOXA11 IDR interacts with the KIX domain of CBP at two discrete sites - MLL and cMyb, mediated by sticky hydrophobic grooves on the surface of KIX. A five residue motif FDQFF on HOXA11 can interact both at cMyb and MLL site of KIX resulting in a promiscuous binding.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe demonstrate how the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of transcription factor HOXA11 interacts at two distinct sites of the transcription coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP). By combining computational docking with limited experimental data we construct models of the complex of the KIX domain within CBP and a short helical segment within the IDR of HOXA11. The interaction between HOXA11 and CBP is believed to trigger the downstream expression of genes important in embryonic development.",

The exponential increase in targeted agents directed at pivotal oncogenic pathways now provide new therapeutic opportunities for this tumour type. However, lack of comprehensive precision oncology testing at diagnosis means such therapeutic opportunities are potentially overlooked.\n\nTo investigate the role of semiconductor sequencing for detection of predictive biomarkers in routine glioblastoma samples we have undertaken analysis of test trending data generated by a clinically validated next generation sequencing platform designed to capture 764 of the leading anti-cancer targeted agents/combinations and immunotherapies via analysis of actionable genomic variants distributed across 505 genes. Analysis was performed across a cohort of 55 glioblastoma patients.\n\nAnalysis of trending data has revealed a complex and rich actionable mutational landscape in which 166 actionable mutations were detected across 36 genes linked to 17 off label targeted therapy protocols and 111 clinical trials. The majority of patients harboured three or more actionable mutations affecting key cancer related regulatory networks including the PI3K/AKT/MTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK signalling pathways, DNA-damage repair pathways and cell cycle checkpoints. Linkage with immunotherapy and PARP inhibitors was identified in 44% of glioblastoma patients as a consequence of alterations in DNA-damage repair genes.\n\nTaken together our data indicates that precision oncology testing utilising semiconductor sequencing can be used to identify a broad therapeutic armamentarium of targeted therapies and immunotherapies that can be potentially employed for the improved clinical management of glioblastoma patients.",

Here, we examined the effects of bi-directional fecal microbial transplants (FMT) between methylone-induced hyperthermic tolerant (MHT) and methylone-naive (MN) rats. Rats treated with methylone once per week developed tolerance to methylone-induced hyperthermia by the fourth week. Once tolerant, daily bi-directional FMT between the two groups were performed for seven days prior to the next methylone treatment. The FMT abated the developed tolerance in the MHT group. When treated with methylone for the first time following FMT, recipient MN rats displayed significant tolerance to hyperthermia despite it being their initial drug treatment. Post-FMT, MHT rats displayed elevations in norepinephrine and expression of UCP1, UCP3 and TGR5 in brown adipose tissue, with reductions in expression of TGR5 and UCP3 in skeletal muscle. The pre- and post-FMT methylone tolerance phenotypes of transplant recipients are concurrent with changes in the relative abundance of several Classes of Proteobacteria, most evident for Gammaproteobacter and Alphaproteobacter. MHT recipients demonstrated a marked increase in the relative proportion of the Firmicutes Class Erysipelotrichia.

We used 1050 male broilers from Ross lineage, for two experimental phases: phase 1 (broilers from 1 until 21 days old) and phase 2 (broilers from 22 until 42 days old). The broilers were distributed under a completely randomized design, built for five treatments (110; 175; 240; 305; 370 mEq of DEB/kg of ration) and seven repetitions. For the hematological analyses were used two broilers in each repetition, one to blood count evaluation (Hemogram) and another one to the biochemistry evaluation, collected in the end of each experimental phase. During the phase of 1 - 21 days old, the variable hemoglobin number (Heme), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and Serum Chloride (Cl) presented a linear effect (p<0,05) DEB levels. There was no effects (p>0,05) over the corpuscular volume (CV), total plasma protein (TPP), leukocytes number (Leu), heterophiles (Het), lymphocytes (Lyn), eosinophils (Eos), basophils (Bas), monocytes (Mon), calcium (Ca), phosphor (P), uric acid (UA) e urea (U). During the phase two of 22 - 42 days old there was effect (p<0,05) quadratic to the variables Leu and Het and linear to the variable P and significative difference (p<0,05) between the variable means UA at the levels of DEB tested.\n\nThere was no effect (p>0,05) over the variable CV, Heme, MCV, TPP, Lyn, Eos, Bas, Mon, Cl, Ca and U on the DEB levels tested.

    "abstract": "Sensory deprivation has long been known to cause hallucinations or \"phantom\" sensations, the most common of which is tinnitus induced by hearing loss, affecting 10-20% of the population. An observable hearing loss, causing auditory sensory deprivation over a band of frequencies, is present in over 90% of people with tinnitus. Existing plasticity-based computational models for tinnitus are usually driven by homeostasis mechanisms, modeled to fit phenomenological findings. Here, we use an objective-driven learning algorithm to model an early auditory processing neuronal network, e.g., in the dorsal cochlear nucleus. The learning algorithm maximizes the networks output entropy by learning the feed-forward and recurrent interactions in the model. We show that the connectivity patterns and responses learned by the model display several hallmarks of early auditory neuronal networks. We further demonstrate that attenuation of peripheral inputs drives the recurrent network towards its critical point and transition into a tinnitus-like state. In this state, the network activity resembles responses to genuine inputs even in the absence of external stimulation, namely, it \"hallucinates\" auditory responses. These findings demonstrate how objective-driven plasticity mechanisms that normally act to optimize the networks input representation can also elicit pathologies such as tinnitus as a result of sensory deprivation.\n\nAuthor summaryTinnitus or \"ringing in the ears\" is a common pathology. It may result from mechanical damage in the inner ear, as well as from certain drugs such as salicylate (aspirin). A common approach toward a computational model for tinnitus is to use a neural network model with inherent plasticity applied to early auditory processing, where the input layer models the auditory nerve and the output layer models a nucleus in the brain stem. However, most of the existing computational models are phenomenological in nature, driven by a homeostatic principle. Here, we use an objective-driven learning algorithm based on information theory to learn the feed-forward interactions between the layers, as well as the recurrent interactions within the output layer. Through numerical simulations of the learning process, we show that attenuation of peripheral inputs drives the network into a tinnitus-like state, where the network activity resembles responses to genuine inputs even in the absence of external stimulation; namely, it \"hallucinates\" auditory responses. These findings demonstrate how plasticity mechanisms that normally act to optimize network performance can also lead to undesired outcomes, such as tinnitus, as a result of reduced peripheral hearing.",

Although currently used inactivated whole virus vaccines are effective, vaccination breakthroughs have been reported for which the reasons are unclear. In this study we tested in mice the efficacy of pre-infection with a closely related low-virulent flavivirus, Langat virus (LGTV strain TP21), or a naturally avirulent TBEV strain (TBEV-280) in providing protection against lethal infection with the highly virulent TBEV strain TBEV-Hypr (referred to as TBEV-Hypr). LGTV has been evaluated as an experimental live vaccine against TBE, but further development was abandoned due to too high residual pathogenicity of a LGTV-based vaccine. Here we show that prior infection with TP21 or TBEV-280 is efficient in protecting mice from lethal TBEV-Hypr challenge. Histopathological analysis of brains from non-immunized control mice revealed neuronal TBEV infection and necrosis. Neuroinflammation, gliosis and neuronal necrosis was however also observed in some of the TP21 and TBEV-280 pre-infected mice although at reduced frequency as compared to the non-immunized TBEV-Hypr infected control mice. Interestingly, qPCR detected the presence of viral RNA in the brains and spinal cord of both TP21 and TBEV-280 immunized mice after TBEV-Hypr challenge, but significantly reduced compared to mock-immunized mice. Our results indicate that although TBEV-Hypr infection is effectively controlled in the periphery upon immunization with low-virulent LGTV or naturally avirulent TBEV-280, it may still enter the CNS of these animals. These findings improve our understanding of potential causes for vaccine failure in individuals vaccinated with TBE vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is a zoonotic pathogen that causes diarrheal disease in humans and animals. During salmonellosis, S. Typhimurium colonizes epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract. S. Typhimurium has an unusual lifestyle in epithelial cells that begins within an endocytic-derived Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV), followed by escape into the cytosol, epithelial cell lysis and bacterial release. The cytosol is a more permissive environment than the SCV and supports rapid bacterial growth. The physicochemical conditions encountered by S. Typhimurium within the cytosol, and the bacterial genes required for cytosolic colonization, remain unknown. Here we have exploited the parallel colonization strategies of S. Typhimurium in epithelial cells to decipher the two niche-specific bacterial virulence programs. By combining a population-based RNA-seq approach with single-cell microscopic analysis, we identified bacterial genes/sRNAs with cytosol-specific or vacuole-specific expression signatures. Using these genes/sRNAs as environmental biosensors, we defined that Salmonella is exposed to iron and manganese deprivation and oxidative stress in the cytosol and zinc and magnesium deprivation in the SCV. Furthermore, iron availability was critical for optimal S. Typhimurium replication in the cytosol, as well as entC, fepB, soxS and sitA-mntH. Virulence genes that are typically associated with extracellular bacteria, namely Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1) and SPI4, had a cytosolic-specific expression profile. Our study reveals that the cytosolic and vacuolar S. Typhimurium virulence gene programs are unique to, and tailored for, residence within distinct intracellular compartments. Therefore, this archetypical vacuole-adapted pathogen requires extensive transcriptional reprogramming to successfully colonize the mammalian cytosol.\n\nAuthor SummaryIntracellular pathogens reside either within a membrane-bound vacuole or are free-living in the cytosol and their virulence programs are tailored towards survival within a particular intracellular compartment. Some bacterial pathogens (such as Salmonella enterica) can successfully colonize both intracellular niches, but how they do so is unclear. Here we have exploited the parallel intracellular lifestyles of S. enterica in epithelial cells to identify the niche-specific bacterial expression profiles and environmental cues encountered by S. enterica. We have also discovered bacterial genes that are required for colonization of the cytosol, but not the vacuole. Our results advance our understanding of pathogen-adaptation to alternative replication niches and highlight an emerging concept in the field of bacteria-host cell interactions.",

Two members of the NCLDV, Vaccinia Virus (VACV) and African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV), both synthesize Nudix enzymes that have been shown to decap mRNA, a process thought to accelerate viral and host mRNA turnover and promote the shutoff of host protein synthesis. Mimivirus encodes two Nudix enzymes in its genome, denoted as L375 and L534. Importantly, L375 exhibits sequence similarity to ASFV-DP and eukaryotic Dcp2, two Nudix enzymes shown to possess mRNA decapping activity. In this work, we demonstrate that recombinant Mimivirus L375 cleaves the 5 m7GpppN mRNA cap, releasing m7GDP as a product. L375 did not significantly cleave mRNAs containing an unmethylated 5GpppN cap, indicating that this enzyme specifically hydrolyzes methylated-capped transcripts. A point mutation in the L375 Nudix motif completely eliminated cap hydrolysis, showing that decapping activity is dependent on this motif. Addition of methylated cap derivatives or uncapped RNA inhibited L375 decapping activity, suggesting that L375 recognizes its substrate through interaction with both the mRNA cap and RNA body.",

    "abstract": "Similar species ranges may represent outcomes of common biological processes and so form the basis for biogeographical concepts such as areas of endemism and ecoregions. Nevertheless, spatial range congruence is rarely quantified, much less incorporated in bioregionalization methods as an explicit parameter. Furthermore, most available methods suffer from limitations related to the loss, or the excess of range information, or scale bias associated with the use of grids, and the incapacity to recognize independent overlapped patterns or gradients of range distributions. Here, we propose an analytical method, Spatial Congruence Analysis (SCAN), to identify biogeographically meaningful groups of species, called biogeographic elements. Such elements are based on direct and indirect spatial relationships among species ranges and vary depending on an explicit measure of range congruence controlled as a numerical parameter in the analysis. A one-layered network connects species (vertices) using pairwise spatial congruence estimates (edges). This network is then analyzed for each species, separately, by an algorithm that accesses the entire web of spatial relationships to the reference species. The method was applied to two datasets: a simulated gradient of ranges and real distributions of birds. The gradient results showed that SCAN can describe gradients of distribution with a high level of detail, without confounding transition zones with true biogeographical units, a frequent pitfall of other methods. The bird dataset showed that only a small portion of range overlaps is biogeographically meaningful, and that there is a large variation in types of patterns that can be found with real distributions. Distinct reference species may converge on similar or identical groups of spatially related species, may lead to recognition of nested species groups, or may even generate similar spatial patterns with no species in common. The biological significance or causal processes of these patterns should be investigated a posteriori. Patterns can vary from simple ones, composed by few highly congruent species, to complex, with numerous alternative component species and spatial configurations, depending on particular parameter settings as determined by the investigator. This approach eliminates or reduces limitations of other methods and permits pattern description without hidden assumptions about processes, and so should make a valuable contribution to the biogeographers toolbox.\n\n\"If there is any basic unit of biogeography, it is the geographic range of a species.\" - Brown, Stevens & Kaufman [1].\n\n\"[spatial] congruence [...] should be optimized, while realizing that this criterion will most likely never be fully met\" - HP Linder [2].",

    "abstract": "The phragmoplast is a plant-specific microtubule and microfilament structure that forms during telophase to direct new cell wall formation. The phragmoplast expands towards a specific location at the cell cortex called the division site. How the phragmoplast accurately reaches the division site is currently unknown. We show that a previously uncharacterized microtubule arrays accumulated at the cell cortex. These microtubules were organized by transient interactions with division-site localized proteins and were then incorporated into the phragmoplast to guide it towards the division site. A phragmoplast-guidance defective mutant, tangled1, had aberrant cortical-telophase microtubule accumulation that correlated with phragmoplast positioning defects. Division-site localized proteins may promote proper division plane positioning by organizing the cortical-telophase microtubule array to guide the phragmoplast to the division site during plant cell division.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryMicrotubules accumulate at the cell cortex and interact with the plant division machinery to direct its movement towards the division site.",

    "abstract": "NMDAR-dependent Ca2+ influx underpins multiple forms of synaptic plasticity. In the adult forebrain, the majority of synaptic NMDAR currents are mediated by GluN2A-containing NMDARs. These receptors are rapidly inserted into synapses during LTP; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that GluN2A is phosphorylated at Ser-1459 by CaMKII in response to glycine stimulation that mimics LTP in primary neurons. Phosphorylation of Ser-1459 promotes GluN2A interaction with the SNX27-retromer complex, therefore enhancing the endosomal recycling of NMDARs. Loss of SNX27 or CaMKII function blocks the glycine-induced increase in GluN2A-NMDARs on the neuronal membrane. Interestingly, mutations of Ser-1459, including the rare S1459G human epilepsy variant, prolong decay times of NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents in heterosynapses by increasing the active duration of channel openings. Taken together, these findings not only identify a critical role of Ser-1459 phosphorylation in regulating the function of NMDARs, but also explain how the S1459G epilepsy variant dysregulates NMDAR function.",

    "abstract": "Photoreceptors rely on distinct membrane compartments to support their specialized function. Unlike protein localization, identification of critical differences in membrane content has not yet been expanded to lipids, due to the difficulty of isolating domain-specific samples. We have overcome this by using SMA to co-immunopurify membrane proteins and their native lipids from two regions of photoreceptor ROS disks. Each samples copurified lipids were subjected to untargeted lipidomic and fatty acid analysis. Extensive differences between center (rhodopsin) and rim (ABCA4 and PRPH2/ROM1) samples included a lower PC to PE ratio and increased LC- and VLC-PUFAs in the center relative to the rim region, which were enriched in shorter, saturated FAs. The comparatively few differences between the two rim samples likely reflect specific protein-lipid interactions. High-resolution profiling of the ROS disk lipid composition provides a model for future studies of other complex cellular structures, and gives new insights into how intricate membrane structure and protein activity are balanced within the ROS.\n\nSUMMARYSander et al. have parsed the lipid composition of native-source photoreceptor disks and find large differences in fatty acid unsaturation and chain length between the center and rim regions. They selectively copurify membrane proteins and lipids from each region in SMALPs using nanobodies and antibodies.",

    "abstract": "In Drosophila embryos, genes expressed along the dorsal-ventral axis are responsive to concentration of the Dorsal (Dl) transcription factor, which varies in space; however, levels of this morphogen also build over time. Since expression of high-threshold Dl target genes such as snail (sna) is supported before Dl levels peak, it is unclear what role increasing levels have if any. Here we investigated action of two enhancers that control sna expression in embryos, demonstrating using genome editing that Dl binding sites within one enhancer located promoter proximally, sna.prox, can limit the ability of the other distally-located enhancer, sna.dis, to increase sna levels. In addition, MS2-MCP live imaging was used to study sna transcription rate in wildtype, dl heterozygote, and a background in which a photo-sensitive degron is fused to Dl (dl-BLID). The results demonstrate that, when Dl levels are high, Dl acts through sna.prox to limit the activity of sna.dis and thereby influence sna transcription rate. In contrast, when Dl levels are kept low using dl-BLID, sna.prox positively influences sna transcription rate. Collectively, our data support the view that Dls effect on gene expression changes over time, switching from promoting sna expression at low concentration to dampening sna expression at high concentration by regulating enhancer interactions. We propose this differential action of the Dl morphogen is likely supported by occupancy of this factor first to high and then low affinity binding sites over time as Dl levels rise to coordinate action of these two co-acting enhancers.\n\nSignificance statementA gradient of the maternal transcription factor Dorsal is important for establishing spatial expression of target genes along the dorsal-ventral axis of Drosophila embryos. Dorsal levels are also dynamic as nuclear concentration builds in time. Surprisingly, expression of high-threshold target genes such as snail is supported before levels peak, raising the question why levels continue to build. Our data support the view that peak Dorsal levels act to preferentially support activity of one enhancer over another to effectively decrease snail expression. In addition, while the morphogen Dorsal acts early to support gene expression, later it effectively acts as a damper to limit gene expression. Our results suggest other morphogens also have effects on gene expression that change over time.",

ATP synthase subunit a (ATP6) and subunit 8 (ATP8) are proteins that function as part of the F0 component (proton pump) of the F0F1complex. Both are encoded by the mitochondrial genome and involved in oxidative phosphorylation.

    "abstract": "The woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) was a cold-adapted herbivore, widely distributed from western Europe to north-east Siberia during the Late Pleistocene. Previous studies associate the extinction of the species ~14,000 years before present to climatic and vegetational changes, and suggest that later survival of populations in north-east Siberia may relate to the later persistence of open vegetation in that region. Here, we analyzed carbon ({delta}13C) and nitrogen ({delta}15N) stable isotopes and mitochondrial DNA sequences to elucidate the evolutionary ecology of the species. Our dataset comprised 286 woolly rhinoceros isotopic records, including 192 unpublished records, from across the species range, dating from >58,600 14C years to ~14,000 years before present. Crucially, we present the first 71 isotopic records available to date of the 15,000 years preceding woolly rhinoceros extinction. The data reveal ecological flexibility and geographical variation in woolly rhinoceros stable isotope compositions through time. In north-east Siberia, we detected{delta} 15N stability through time. This could reflect long-term environmental stability, and might have enabled the later survival of the species in the region. To further investigate the palaeoecology of woolly rhinoceroses, we compared their isotopic compositions with that of other contemporary herbivores. This analysis suggests possible niche partitioning between woolly rhinoceros and both horse (Equus spp.) and woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), and isotopic similarities between woolly rhinoceros and both musk ox (Ovibos moschatus) and saiga (Saiga tatarica) at different points in time. To provide phylogeographical context to the isotopic data, we analyzed 61 published mitochondrial control region sequences. The data show a lack of geographic structuring; we found three haplogroups with overlapping distributions, all of which show a signal of expansion during the Last Glacial Maximum. Furthermore, our genetic findings support the notion that environmental stability in Siberia had an impact on the paleoecology of woolly rhinoceroses in the region. Our study highlights the utility of combining stable isotopic records with ancient DNA to advance our knowledge of the evolutionary ecology of past populations and extinct species.",

T. gondii infection promotes increased stromal cell expression of IL-33 and levels of parasite replication correlate with IL-33 release. In response to infection, a subset of innate lymphoid cells (ILC) emerges composed of IL-33R+ NK cells and ILC1s. In Rag-/- mice, where NK cells and ILC1 provide an innate mechanism of resistance to T. gondii, the loss of IL-33R reduced ILC responses and increased parasite replication. Furthermore, administration of IL-33 to Rag-/- mice resulted in a marked decrease in parasite burden, increased production of IFN-{gamma} and the recruitment and expansion of inflammatory monocytes associated with parasite control. These protective effects of exogenous IL-33 were dependent on endogenous IL-12p40 and the ability of IL-33 to enhance ILC production of IFN-{gamma}. These results highlight that IL-33 synergizes with IL-12 to promote ILC-mediated resistance to T. gondii.",

Nevertheless, SNP data is desirable both for genotyping and to understand the DNA methylome in the context of the genetic background. The confounding effect of bisulfite conversion can be resolved by observing differences in allele counts on a per-strand basis, whereby artificial mutations are reflected by non-complementary base pairs. Herein, we present a computational pre-processing approach for adapting sequence alignment data, thus indirectly enabling downstream analysis in this manner using conventional variant calling software such as GATK or Freebayes.

    "abstract": "Rilling & Insel have argued that in primates, bigger brains have proportionally fewer anatomical interhemispheric connections, leading to reduced functional connectivity between the hemispheres (1). They based this on a comparison between surface areas of the corpus callosum and cortex rather than estimating connection counts, while leaving out other quantities also dependent on brain size such as callosal fiber density, neuron density, and number of functional areas.\n\nWe use data from the literature to directly estimate connection counts. First, we estimate callosal fiber density as a function of brain size. We validate this by comparing out-of-sample human data to our functions estimate. We then mine the literature to obtain function estimates for all other quantities, and use them to estimate intra- and interhemispheric white matter connection counts as a function of brain size.\n\nThe results show a much larger decrease in the scaling of interhemispheric to intrahemispheric connections than previously estimated. However, we hypothesize that raw connection counts are the wrong quantity to be estimating when considering functional connectivity. Instead, we hypothesize that functional connectivity is related to connection counts relative to the number of cortical areas.\n\nAccordingly, we estimate inter-area connection counts for intra- and interhemispheric connectivity and find no difference in how they scale with brain size. We find that, on average, an interhemispheric inter-area connection contains 3-8x more connections than an intrahemispheric inter-area connection, regardless of brain size. In doing so, we find that the fiber count of the human corpus callosum has been underestimated by 20%.\n\nSignificance StatementThere are arguments in the literature that larger brains have proportionally fewer interhemispheric connections. We find that the decrease is even larger than previously estimated. However, we argue that this quantity is the wrong thing to measure: Rather, we should measure functional connectivity between cortical areas. We show that the ratio of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric connectivity between cortical areas is constant across mammalian species. These findings are consistent with a growing literature that suggest interhemispheric connectivity is special across all primate species.",

    "abstract": "Cell patterning in epithelia is critical for the establishment of tissue function during development. The organization of patterns in these tissues is mediated by the interpretation of signals operating across multiple length scales. How epithelial tissues coordinate changes in cell identity across these length scales to orchestrate cellular rearrangements and fate specification remains poorly understood. Here, we use human neural tube organoids as model systems to interrogate epithelial patterning principles that guide domain specification. In silico modeling of the patterning process by cellular automata, validated by in vitro experiments, reveal that the initial positions of floor plate cells, coupled with activator-inhibitor signaling interactions, deterministically dictate the patterning outcome according to a discretized Turing reaction-diffusion mechanism. This model predicts an enhancement of organoid patterning by modulating inhibitor levels. Receptor-ligand interaction analysis of scRNAseq data from multiple organoid domains reveals WNT-pathway ligands as the specific inhibitory agents, thereby allowing for the experimental validation of model predictions. These results demonstrate that neuroepithelia employ reaction-diffusion-based mechanisms during early embryonic human development to organize cellular identities and morphogen sources to achieve patterning. The wider implementation of such in vitro organoid models in combination with in-silico agent-based modeling coupled to receptor-ligand analysis of scRNAseq data opens avenues for a broader understanding of dynamic tissue patterning processes.",

    "abstract": "The Hodgkin-Huxley model, decades after its first presentation, is still a reference model in neuroscience as it has successfully reproduced the electrophysiological activity of many organisms. The primary signal in the model represents the membrane potential of a neuron. A parametric and simple representation of this signal is presented in this paper.\n\nThe new proposal is an adapted Frequency Modulated Mobius multicomponent model defined as a flexible decomposition in waves that describe the signal morphology. A specific feature of the new model is that the parameters are subject to interpretable restrictions.\n\nA broad simulation experiment is conducted to show the new model accurately represents the simulated Hodgkin-Huxley signal. Moreover, the model potential to predict the neurons relevant characteristics, described with parameters of the Hodgkin Huxley model, is shown using different Machine Learning methods. The proposed model is also validated with real data from Squid Giant Axons. The comparison of the parameter configuration between the simulated and real data demonstrated the flexibility of the model as well as interesting differences.\n\nAuthor summaryAlejandro Rodriguez-Collado.

    "abstract": "Scientists from nearly all disciplines face the problem of simultaneously evaluating many hypotheses. Conducting multiple comparisons increases the likelihood that a non-negligible proportion of associations will be false positives, clouding real discoveries.\n\nDrawing valid conclusions require taking into account the number of performed statistical tests and adjusting the statistical confidence measures. Several strategies exist to overcome the problem of multiple hypothesis testing. We aim to summarize critical statistical concepts and widely used correction approaches while also draw attention to frequently misinterpreted notions of statistical inference.\n\nWe provide a step-by-step description of each multiple-testing correction method with clear examples and present an easy-to-follow guide for selecting the most suitable correction technique.\n\nTo facilitate multiple-testing corrections, we developed a fully automated solution not requiring programming skills or the use of a command line. Our registration free online tool is available at www.multipletesting.com and compiles the five most frequently used adjustment tools, including the Bonferroni, the Holm (step-down), the Hochberg (step-up) corrections, allows to calculate False Discovery Rates (FDR) and q-values.\n\nThe current summary provides a much needed practical synthesis of basic statistical concepts regarding multiple hypothesis testing in a comprehensible language with well-illustrated examples. The web tool will fill the gap for life science researchers by providing a user-friendly substitute for command-line alternatives.",
