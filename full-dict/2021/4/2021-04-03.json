    "abstract": "Infant crying is an innate communicative behavior that is frequently impaired in certain neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Since advanced paternal age is a reported risk factor for NDDs in offspring, we evaluated the impact of a fathers age on early vocal development in C57BL/6J mice. We recorded and applied a unique combination of computational analyses to ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) emitted by mouse pups sired by young and aged fathers. Our data showed that advanced paternal age reduced the number and duration of USVs, and altered the syllable composition in pups. Moreover, pups born to young fathers showed convergent vocal characteristics with a rich repertoire during postnatal development, while those born to aged fathers exhibited more divergent vocal patterns with limited repertoire. Principal component analysis in conjunction with clustering analysis demonstrated that pups from aged fathers deviated from typical trajectories of vocal development, which were considered as atypical individuals. Thus, our study indicates that advanced paternal age has a significant effect on offsprings early vocal development. It is suggested that the trajectories of vocal development could be a useful marker of the NDD-like phenotype associated with the advanced paternal age. In addition, our comprehensive computational analysis described here is an effective approach to characterize the altered individual diversity relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryAdvanced paternal age affects vocal development in early postnatal mice, with more pups showing atypical developmental trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity in communities is changing globally, including the gain and loss of host species in host-pathogen communities. Increased host diversity can cause infection prevalence in a focal host to increase (amplification) or decrease (dilution). However, it is unclear what general rules govern the context dependent effects, in part because theories for pathogens with different transmission modes have developed largely independently. Using a two-host model, we explore how the pathogen transmission mode and characteristics of a second host (disease competence and competitive ability) influence disease prevalence in a focal host. Our work shows how the theories for pathogens with environmental transmission, density-dependent direct transmission, and frequency-dependent direct transmission can be unified. Our work also identifies general rules about how host and pathogen characteristics affect amplification/dilution. For example, higher competence hosts promote amplification, unless they are strong interspecific competitors; strong interspecific competitors promote dilution, unless they are large sources of new infections; and dilution occurs under frequency-dependent direct transmission more than density-dependent direct transmission, unless interspecific host competition is sufficiently strong. Our work helps explain how the characteristics of the pathogen and a second host affect disease prevalence in a focal host.",

    "abstract": "In diagnosing sleep disorders, sleep stage classification is a very essential yet time-consuming process. Most of the existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on hand-crafted features and multi-modality polysomnography (PSG) data, where prior knowledge is compulsory and high computation cost can be expected. Besides, few studies are able to obtain high accuracy sleep staging using raw single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG). To overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes an end-to-end framework with a deep neural network, namely SingleChannelNet, for automatic sleep stage classification based on raw single-channel EEG. The proposed model utilizes a 90s epoch as the textual input and employs two multi-convolution blocks and several max-average pooling layers to learn different scales of feature representations. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model, we evaluate our model using different raw single-channel EEGs (C4/A1 and Fpz-Cz) on two different datasets (CC-SHS and Sleep-EDF datasets). Experimental results show that the proposed architecture can achieve better over-all accuracy and Cohens kappa (CCSHS: 90.2%-86.5%, Sleep-EDF: 86.1%-80.5%) compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, the proposed model can learn features automatically for sleep stage classification using different single-channel EEGs with distinct sampling rates from different datasets without using any hand-engineered features.",

    "abstract": "Brain activation mapping using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been extensively studied in brain gray matter (GM), whereas in large disregarded for probing white matter (WM). This unbalanced treatment has been in part due to controversies in relation to the nature of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast in WM and its detachability. However, an accumulating body of studies has provided solid evidence of the functional significance of the BOLD signal in WM and has revealed that it exhibits anisotropic spatio-temporal correlations and structure-specific fluctuations concomitant with those of the cortical BOLD signal. In this work, we present an anisotropic spatial filtering scheme for smoothing fMRI data in WM that accounts for known spatial constraints on the BOLD signal in WM. In particular, the spatial correlation structure of the BOLD signal in WM is highly anisotropic and closely linked to local axonal structure in terms of shape and orientation, suggesting that isotropic Gaussian filters conventionally used for smoothing fMRI data are inadequate for denoising the BOLD signal in WM. The fundamental element in the proposed method is a graph-based description of WM that encodes the underlying anisotropy observed across WM, derived from diffusion-weighted MRI data. Based on this representation, and leveraging graph signal processing principles, we design subject-specific spatial filters that adapt to a subjects unique WM structure at each position in the WM that they are applied at. We use the proposed filters to spatially smooth fMRI data in WM, as an alternative to the conventional practice of using isotropic Gaussian filters. We test the proposed filtering approach on two sets of simulated phantoms, showcasing its greater sensitivity and specificity for the detection of slender anisotropic activations, compared to that achieved with isotropic Gaussian filters. We also present WM activation mapping results on the Human Connectome Projects 100-unrelated subject dataset, across seven functional tasks, showing that the proposed method enables the detection of streamline-like activations within axonal bundles.",

Mycologists have described the different fungal fruiting bodies, while geneticists have partly unravelled the regulation of sexual development. However, the sequential fungal cell biology of fertilisation and the associated nuclear dynamics after plasmogamy are poorly understood. Using histone-fluorescent parental isolates, we tracked male and female nuclei during fertilisation in the model ascomycetes Neurospora crassa using live-cell-imaging. This study unravels the behaviour of trichogyne resident female nuclei and the extraordinary manner that male nuclei migrate up the trichogyne to the protoperithecium. Our observations raise new fundamental questions about the modus operandi of nuclei movements during sexual reproduction, male and female nuclear identity, guidance of nuclei within the trichogyne and, unexpectedly, the avoidance of \"polyspermy\" in fungi. The spatio-temporal dynamics of male nuclei within the trichogyne following plasmogamy are also described, where the speed and the deformation of male nuclei are of the most dramatic observed to date in a living organism.",

Recent studies suggest that in each step of the rotation, key glutamic acid residues in different c-subunits contribute to proton release to and proton uptake from the a-subunit. However, no studies have demonstrated cooperativity among c-subunits toward FoF1-ATP synthase activity. Here, we addressed this using Bacillus PS3 ATP synthase harboring c-ring with various combinations of wild-type and cE56D, enabled by genetically fused single-chain c-ring. ATP synthesis and proton pump activities were decreased by a single cE56D mutation and further decreased by double cE56D mutations. Moreover, activity further decreased as the two mutation sites were separated, indicating cooperation among c-subunits. Similar results were obtained for proton transfer-coupled molecular simulations. Simulations revealed that prolonged proton uptake in mutated c-subunits is shared between two c-subunits, explaining the cooperation observed in biochemical assays.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are regulated is of central importance for the development of new therapies for blood disorders and stem cell transplantation. To date, HSPC regulation has been extensively studied in vitro and in animal models, but less is known about the mechanisms in vivo in humans. Here, in a genome-wide association study on 13,167 individuals, we identify 9 significant and 2 suggestive DNA sequence variants that influence HSPC (CD34+) levels in human blood. The identified loci associate with blood disorders, harbor known and novel HSPC genes, and affect gene expression in HSPCs. Interestingly, our strongest association maps to the PPM1H gene, encoding an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine phosphatase never previously implicated in stem cell biology. PPM1H is expressed in HSPCs, and the allele that confers higher blood CD34+ cell levels downregulates PPM1H. By functional fine-mapping, we find that this downregulation is caused by the variant rs772557-A, which abrogates a MYB transcription factor binding site in PPM1H intron 1 that is active in specific HSPC subpopulations, including hematopoietic stem cells, and interacts with the promoter by chromatin looping. Furthermore, rs772557-A selectively increases HSPC subpopulations in which the MYB site is active, and PPM1H shRNA- knockdown increased CD34+ and CD34+90+ cell proportions in umbilical cord blood cultures. Our findings represent the first large-scale association study on a stem cell trait, illuminating HSPC regulation in vivo in humans, and identifying PPM1H as a novel inhibition target that can potentially be utilized clinically to facilitate stem cell harvesting for transplantation.",

We determined each to harbor a previously described de novo dominant-negative heterozygous mutation in ATAD3A, encoding ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 3A (ATAD3A). We identified five further patients with mutations in ATAD3A, and recorded up-regulated ISG expression and interferon alpha protein in four of them. Knockdown of ATAD3A in THP-1 cells resulted in increased interferon signaling, mediated by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Enhanced interferon signaling was abrogated in THP-1 cells and patient fibroblasts depleted of mtDNA.

    "abstract": "The introduction of fetal or neonatal signatures such as cell cycle promoting genes into damaged adult hearts has been vigorously pursued as a promising strategy for stimulating proliferation and regeneration of adult cardiomyocytes, which normally cannot divide. However, cell division of cardiomyocytes requires preceding dedifferentiation with sarcomere disassembly and calcium dysregulation, which, in principle, compromises contractile function. To overcome this intrinsic dilemma, we explored the feasibility of optimizing the induction protocol of the cell cycle promoter in mice. As a model of this approach, we used Fam64a, a fetal-specific cardiomyocyte cell cycle promoter that we have recently identified. We first analyzed transgenic mice maintaining long-term cardiomyocyte-specific expression of Fam64a after birth, when endogenous expression was abolished. Despite having an enhanced proliferation of postnatal cardiomyocytes, these mice showed age-related cardiac dysfunction characterized by sustained cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation, which was reminiscent of the dilemma. Mechanistically, Fam64a inhibited glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transcriptional activation of Klf15, a key regulator that drives cardiomyocyte differentiation, thereby directing cardiomyocytes toward immature undifferentiated states. In contrast, transient induction of Fam64a in cryoinjured wildtype adult mice hearts improved functional recovery with augmented cell cycle activation of cardiomyocytes. These data indicate that optimizing the intensity and duration of the stimulant to avoid excessive cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation could pave the way toward developing efficient strategy for successful heart regeneration.",

Using soluble ligands, we show that primary hepatocyte (PH)-derived organoids but not bile duct (BD)-derived organoids may be used to recapitulate the resting liver. We provide evidence that differentiation of PH-organoids in the presence of Wnt9b and Rspo3 induce pericentral maturation. Finally, we show that immobilization of Rspo3 onto beads in combination with soluble Wnt9b may be a valid strategy to recreate the central vein Wnt microenvironment in vitro.",

    "abstract": "This study describes the evolution of knockdown resistance (kdr) haplotypes in Aedes aegypti in response to pyrethroid insecticide use over the course of 18 years in Iquitos, Peru. Based on the duration and intensiveness of sampling ([~]10,000 samples), this is the most thorough study of kdr population genetics in Ae. aegypti to date within a city. We provide evidence for the direct connection between programmatic citywide pyrethroid spraying and the increase in frequency of specific kdr haplotypes by identifying two evolutionary events in the population. The relatively high selection coefficients, even under infrequent insecticide pressure, emphasizes how quickly populations can evolve. The observed rapid increase in frequency of resistance alleles might have been aided by the incomplete dominance of resistance-conferring alleles over corresponding susceptibility alleles. In addition to dramatic temporal shifts, spatial suppression experiments reveal that genetic heterogeneity existed not only at the citywide scale, but also on a very fine scale within the city.",

    "abstract": "A new abundance of full-length HIV-1 genome sequences provides an opportunity to revisit the standard model of HIV-1/M diversity that clusters genomes into largely non-recombinant subtypes, which is not consistent with recent evidence of deep recombinant histories for SIV and other HIV-1 groups. Here we develop an unsupervised non-parametric clustering approach, which does not rely on predefined non-recombinant genomes, by adapting a community detection method developed for dynamic social network analysis. We show that this method (DSBM) attains a significantly lower mean error rate in detecting recombinant breakpoints in simulated data (quasibinomial GLM, P < 8 x 10-8), compared to other reference-free recombination detection programs (GARD, RDP4 and RDP5). Applied to a representative sample of n = 525 actual HIV-1 genomes, we determined k = 25 as the optimal number of DSBM clusters, and used change point detection to estimate that at least 95% of these genomes are recombinant. Further, we identified both known and novel recombination hotspots in the HIV-1 genome, and evidence of inter-subtype recombination in HIV-1 subtype reference genomes. We propose that clusters generated by DSBM can provide an informative new framework for HIV-1 classification.",

However, even though zebrafish embryos with a runx1 W84X mutation have defects in early definitive hematopoiesis, some runx1W84X/W84X embryos can develop to fertile adults with blood cells of multi-lineages, raising the possibility that HSCs can emerge without RUNX1. Here, using three new zebrafish runx1-/- lines we uncovered the compensatory mechanism for runx1-independent hematopoiesis. We show that, in the absence of a functional runx1, a cd41-GFP+ population of hematopoietic precursors still emerge from the hemogenic endothelium and can colonize the hematopoietic tissues of the mutant embryos. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the cd41-GFP+ cells identified a set of runx1-/--specific signature genes during hematopoiesis. Significantly, gata2b, which normally acts upstream of runx1 for the generation of HSCs, was increased in the cd41-GFP+ cells in runx1- /- embryos. Interestingly, genetic inactivation of both gata2b and its paralog, gata2a, did not affect hematopoiesis. However, knocking out runx1 and any three of the four alleles of gata2a and gata2b abolished definitive hematopoiesis. Gata2 expression was also upregulated in hematopoietic cells in Runx1-/- mice, suggesting the compensatory mechanism is conserved. Our findings indicate that RUNX1 and GATA2 serve redundant roles for HSC production, acting as each others safeguard.\n\nKey pointsO_LIExistence of RUNX1-independent mechanisms for the generation of HSCs and the development of functional definitive hematopoietic cells\nC_LIO_LIGATA2 and RUNX1 functionally complement each other for their respective roles during hematopoiesis\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "During the past five years, deep-learning algorithms have enabled ground-breaking progress towards the prediction of tertiary structure from a protein sequence. Very recently, we developed SAdLSA, a new computational algorithm for protein sequence comparison via deep-learning of protein structural alignments. SAdLSA shows significant improvement over established sequence alignment methods. In this contribution, we show that SAdLSA provides a general machine-learning framework for structurally characterizing protein sequences. By aligning a protein sequence against itself, SAdLSA generates a fold distogram for the input sequence, including challenging cases whose structural folds were not present in the training set. About 70% of the predicted distograms are statistically significant. Although at present the accuracy of the intra-sequence distogram predicted by SAdLSA self-alignment is not as good as deep-learning algorithms specifically trained for distogram prediction, it is remarkable that the prediction of single protein structures is encoded by an algorithm that learns ensembles of pairwise structural comparisons, without being explicitly trained to recognize individual structural folds. As such, SAdLSA can not only predict protein folds for individual sequences, but also detects subtle, yet significant, structural relationships between multiple protein sequences using the same deep-learning neural network. The former reduces to a special case in this general framework for protein sequence annotation.",

    "abstract": "Fungal lectins are a large family of glycan-binding proteins, with no enzymatic activity. They play fundamental biological roles in the interactions of fungi with their environment and are found in many different species throughout the fungal kingdom. In particular, their contribution to defence against feeders has been emphasized and extracellular lectins may be involved in the recognition of bacteria, fungal competitors and specific host plants. Their carbohydrate specificities and quaternary structures vary widely, but evidence for an evolutionary relationship within the different classes of lectins is provided by the high degree of amino acid sequence identity shared by the different fungal lectins. The UniLectin3D database contains 194 3D structures of fungal lectins, of which 129 are characterized with their carbohydrate ligand. UniLectin3D lectin classes from all origins were used to construct 107 lectin motifs in 26 folding configurations and to screen 1,223 species deposited in the genomic portal MycoCosm of the Joint Genome Institute. The resulting 33 485 protein sequences of putative lectins are organized in MycoLec, a publicly available and searchable database. The characterization of the lectin candidates in fungal genomes is based on systematic statistics regarding potential carbohydrate ligands, protein lengths, signal peptides, relative motif positions and amino acid compositions of fungal lectins. These results shed light on the evolution of the lectin gene families.",

While most cyanobacteria only absorb visible photons, some of them can acclimate to harvest far-red light (FRL, 700-800 nm) by integrating chlorophyll f and d in their photosystems and producing red-shifted allophycocyanin. Chlorophyll f insertion enables the photosystems to use FRL but slows down charge separation, reducing photosynthetic efficiency. Here we demonstrate with time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy that charge separation in chlorophyll-f-containing Photosystem II becomes faster in the presence of red-shifted allophycocyanin antennas. This is different from all known photosynthetic systems, where additional light-harvesting complexes slow down charge separation. Based on the available structural information, we propose a model for the connectivity between the phycobiliproteins and Photosystem II that qualitatively accounts for our spectroscopic data. This unique design is probably important for these cyanobacteria to efficiently switch between visible and far-red light.",

Recent emergence of highly virulent Fov race 4 (Fov4) and its aggressiveness toward Gossypium barbadense (pima) cultivars are raising significant concerns for the US cotton industry. One of the key challenges in studying Fov4 virulence and cotton Fusarium wilt pathogenesis is establishing a disease assay strategy that can help researcher overcome several technical challenges, including efficient infection and highly reproducible and consistent symptom development. Here, we have developed a small-scale, soil-free Fusarium wilt disease assay that can complement conventional assays with faster symptom development and high reproducibility in infected pima cotton seedlings. Our data showed statistically significant differences (p<0.0001) between Fov4-infected and non-infected pima cotton at 4 and 6 days post inoculation (dpi) when compared to control experiments. At 6 dpi, longitudinal observations under magnification showed Fov4 colonization in primary xylem of infected plants, which is a common symptom observed in Fov4 triggered Fusarium wilt in pima cotton. While this is an artificial assay system, this soil-free disease testing strategy can offer another strategy to supplement current assays when studying pathogen-host interaction in soil-borne diseases.",

    "abstract": "Bordetella pertussis (Bp) is a highly contagious bacterium that is the causative agent of whooping cough (pertussis). Currently, acellular pertussis vaccines (aP; DTaP; Tdap) are used to prevent pertussis disease. However, it is clear that the aP vaccine efficacy quickly wanes, resulting in the re-emergence of pertussis. Furthermore, recent work performed by the CDC suggest that current circulating strains are genetically distinct from strains of the past. Emergence of genetically diverging strains combined with waning aP vaccine efficacy call for re-evaluation of current animal models of pertussis. In this study, we used the rat model of pertussis to compare two genetically divergent strains Tohama 1 and D420. We intranasally challenged seven-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats with 108 viable Tohama 1 and D420 and measured the hallmark signs/symptoms of Bp infection such as neutrophilia, pulmonary inflammation, and paroxysmal cough using whole body plethysmography. Onset of cough occurred between 2-4 days after Bp challenge averaging five coughs per fifteen minutes, with peak coughing occurring at day eight post infection averaging upward of thirteen coughs per fifteen minutes. However, we observed an increase of coughs in rats infected with clinical isolate D420 through 12 days post challenge. The rats exhibited increased bronchial restriction following Bp infection. Histology of the lung and flow cytometry confirm both cellular infiltration and pulmonary inflammation. D420 infection induced higher production of anti-Bp IgM antibodies compared to Tohama 1 infection. The coughing rat model provides a way of characterizing disease manifestation differences between Bp strains.",

Instead, AT2 lineage-specific constitutive and inducible Csf2 deletion revealed the non-redundant function of AT2-derived GM-CSF in instructing AM fate, establishing the postnatal AM compartment, and maintaining AMs in adult lungs. This AT2-AM relationship begins during embryogenesis, where nascent AT2s timely induce GM-CSF expression to support the proliferation and differentiation of fetal monocytes contemporaneously seeding the tissue, and persists into adulthood, when epithelial GM-CSF remains restricted to AT2s.",

B-cell reprograming may be scientifically and therapeutically useful, but current approaches limit B-cell repertoire diversity and disrupt the organization of the heavy-chain locus. A more diverse and physiologic B-cell repertoire targeting a key HIV-1 epitope could facilitate evaluation of vaccines designed to elicit bNAbs, help identity more potent and bioavailable bNAb variants, or directly enhance viral control in vivo. Here we address the challenges of generating such a repertoire by replacing the heavy-chain CDR3 (HCDR3) regions of primary human B cells. To do so, we identified and utilized an uncharacterized Cas12a ortholog that recognizes PAM motifs present in human JH genes. We also optimized the design of 200 nucleotide homology-directed repair templates (HDRT) by minimizing the required 3-5 deletion of the HDRT-complementary strand. Using these techniques, we edited primary human B cells to express a hemagglutinin epitope tag and the HCDR3 regions of the bNAbs PG9 and CH01. Those edited with bNAb HCDR3 efficiently bound trimeric HIV-1 antigens, implying they could affinity mature in vivo in response to the same antigens. This approach generates diverse B-cell repertoires recognizing a key HIV-1 neutralizing epitope.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) and is primarily transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes; however, ZIKV can also be sexually transmitted. During the initial epidemic and in places where ZIKV is now considered endemic, it is difficult to disentangle the risks and contributions of sexual versus vector-borne transmission to adverse pregnancy outcomes. To examine the potential impact of sexual transmission of ZIKV on pregnancy outcome, we challenged three rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) three times intravaginally with 1 x 107 PFU of a low passage, African lineage ZIKV isolate (ZIKV-DAK) in the first trimester ([~]30 days gestational age). Samples were collected from all animals initially on days 3 through 10 post challenge, followed by twice, and then once weekly sample collection; ultrasound examinations were performed every 3-4 days then weekly as pregnancies progressed. All three dams had ZIKV RNA detectable in plasma on day 3 post-ZIKV challenge. At approximately 45 days gestation (17-18 days post-challenge), two of the three dams were found to have nonviable embryos by ultrasound. Viral RNA was detected in recovered tissues and at the maternal-fetal interface (MFI) in both cases. The remaining viable pregnancy proceeded to near term ([~]155 days gestational age) and ZIKV RNA was detected at the MFI but not in fetal tissues. These results suggest that sexual transmission of ZIKV may represent an underappreciated risk of pregnancy loss during early gestation.",

    "abstract": "In plants, iron (Fe) & zinc (Zn) uptake and transportation from the rhizosphere to the grain is a critical process regulated by complex transcriptional regulatory networks. However, understanding the combined effect of Fe & Zn starvation on their uptake and transportation and the molecular regulatory networks that control them lack in wheat. Here, we performed a comprehensive physiological, biochemical and transcriptome analysis in two bread wheat genotypes, i.e. Narmada 195 and PBW 502, differing in inherent Fe & Zn content to understand the mechanism of Fe & Zn homeostasis. Compared to PBW 502, Narmada 195 exhibited increased tolerance to Fe & Zn withdrawal by an increased level of antioxidant enzymes and DPPH radical scavenging activity along with less malondialdehyde (MDA), H2O2 level, increased PS accumulation and lower reduction of root and shoot Fe & Zn content and length, leaf chlorosis, and leaf area. By integrating physiological and biochemical data along with co-expression & functional genome annotation and gene expression analysis, we identified 25 core genes associated with four key pathways, i.e. Met cycle (10), PS biosynthesis (4), antioxidant (3) and transport system (8) that were significantly modulated by Fe & Zn withdrawal in both the genotypes. Genes of these four pathways were more considerably up-regulated in Narmada 195, allowing better tolerance to Fe & Zn withdrawal and efficient uptake and transportation of Fe & Zn. Chromosomal distribution and sub-genome wise mapping of these genes showed a contribution from all the chromosomes except group 5 chromosomes with the highest number of genes mapped to chromosome 4 (24%) and sub-genome D (40%). Besides, we also identified 26 miRNAs targeting 14 core genes across the four pathways. Together, our work provides a crucial angle for an in-depth understanding of regulatory cross-talk among physiological, biochemical and transcriptional reprogramming underlying Fe & Zn withdrawal in wheat. Core genes identified can serve as valuable resources for further functional research for genetic improvement of Fe & Zn content in wheat grain.\n\nHighlightOur work provides a crucial angle for a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanism underlying Fe & Zn withdrawal associated with physiological, biochemical and transcriptional reprogramming in wheat.",

    "abstract": "Keystone species are disproportionately important for ecosystem functioning (1,2). However, while all species engage in multiple interaction types with other species, the importance of keystone species is often defined based on a single dimension of their Eltonian niche (3), that is, one type of interaction (e.g., keystone predator). Therefore, it remains unclear whether the importance of keystone species is unidimensional or if it extends across interaction types. We conducted a meta-analysis of tripartite interaction networks to examine whether species importance in one dimension of their niche is mirrored in other niche dimensions, and whether this is associated with interaction outcome, intimacy, or species richness. We show that keystone species importance is positively associated across multiple ecological niche dimensions, independently of species abundance, and find no evidence that multidimensionality of keystone species is influenced by the explanatory variables. We propose that the role of keystone species extends across multiple ecological niche dimensions, with important implications for ecosystem resilience and conservation.\n\nSignificance StatementKeystone species are often identified by focusing on a single type of interaction (e.g., predation, pollination, herbivory) which contrasts with the multiple roles that species play in biological communities. We conducted a meta-analysis of 18 tripartite interaction networks to explore if keystonness is correlated across the multiple dimensions of species Eltonian niches. Our results suggest that species importance tends to span across multiple interaction types, independently from abundance, which can be key to understand community resilience and collapse in face of multiple threats.",

    "abstract": "Dietary interventions can dramatically affect physiological health and organismal lifespan. The degree to which organismal health is improved depends upon genotype and the severity of dietary intervention, but neither the effects of these factors, nor their interaction, have been quantified in an outbred population. Moreover, it is not well understood what physiological changes occur shortly after dietary change and how these may affect the health of early adulthood population. In this article, we investigated the effect of six month exposure of either caloric restriction or intermittent fasting on a broad range of physiological traits in 960 one year old Diversity Outbred mice. We found caloric restriction and intermittent fasting affected distinct aspects of physiology and neither the magnitude nor the direction (beneficial or detrimental) of effects were concordant with the severity of the intervention. In addition to the effects of diet, genetic variation significantly affected 31 of 36 traits (heritabilties ranged from 0.04-0.65). We observed significant covariation between many traits that was due to both diet and genetics and quantified these effects with phenotypic and genetic correlations. We genetically mapped 16 diet-independent and 2 diet-dependent significant quantitative trait loci, both of which were associated with cardiac physiology. Collectively, these results demonstrate the degree to which diet and genetics interact to shape the physiological health of early adult-hood mice following six months of dietary intervention.",

    "abstract": "MLR COMPASS-like complexes are highly conserved histone modifiers and enhancer regulators recruited by multiple transcription factors during differentiation and development, including lineage-determining factors, nuclear receptors, and developmental signaling pathway effectors. While the essential functions of MLR complexes during differentiation-associated transcriptional reprogramming has been well-explored, roles that these complexes play during reprogramming events in terminally differentiated cells remain understudied. We determined that the Drosophila MLR complex is required in fat body adipocytes for proper regulation of the triglyceride depletion rate during non-feeding periods, including metamorphosis and adult starvation. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the complex plays a critical role in controlling stress-related reprogramming in these cells, suggesting that the metabolic phenotypes are indirect effects of dysregulated stress transcription. Furthermore, our evidence suggests that the complex interacts with Foxo and Relish (Nf-{kappa}b) pathways and is required for proper expression of their targets. This investigation further elucidates the necessary functions of MLR complexes in regulating transcriptional reprogramming in terminally differentiated cells as well as suggests novel binding partners. Apparent roles for these complexes in the proper regulation of stress-induced transcription implies new mechanisms involved in cancer and other human diseases associated with MLR subunit mutation.",

    "abstract": "In bottom-up mass spectrometry based proteomics, deep proteome coverage is limited by high cofragmentation rates. This occurs when more than one analyte is isolated by the quadrupole and the subsequent fragmentation event produces fragment ions of heterogeneous origin. One strategy to reduce cofragmentation rates is through effective peptide separation techniques such as chromatographic separation and, the more recently popularized, ion mobility (IM) spectrometry which separates peptides by their collisional cross section. Here we investigate the capability of the Trapped Ion Mobility Spectrometry (TIMS) device to effectively separate peptide ions and quantify the separation power of the TIMS device in the context of a Parallel Accumulation-Serial Fragmentation (PASEF) workflow. We found that TIMS IM separation increases the number of interference-free MS1 features 9.2-fold, while decreasing the average peptide density in precursor spectra 6.5 fold. In a Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA) PASEF workflow, IM separation increased the number of spectra without cofragmentation by a factor of 4.1 and the number of high quality spectra 17-fold. This observed decrease in spectral complexity results in a substantial increase in peptide identification rates when using our data-driven model. In the context of a Data Independent Acquisition (DIA), the reduction in spectral complexity resulting from IM separation is estimated to be equivalent to a 4-fold decrease in isolation window width (from 25Da to 6.5Da). Our study shows that TIMS IM separation dramatically reduces cofragmentation rates leading to an increase in peptide identification rates.",

We have benchmarked KBoost against other high performing algorithms using three different datasets. The results show that our method compares favorably to other methods across datasets.

    "abstract": "Spatial models often assume isotropy and stationarity, implying that spatial dependence is direction invariant and uniform throughout the study area. However, these assumptions are violated when dispersal barriers are present in the form of geographical features or disease control interventions. Despite this, the issue of non-stationarity has been little explored in the context of plant health. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of different barriers in the distribution of the quarantine plant pathogenic bacterium Xylella fastidiosa in the demarcated area in Alicante, Spain. Occurrence data from the official surveys in 2018 were analyzed with four spatial Bayesian hierarchical models: i) a stationary model representing a scenario without any control interventions or geographical features; ii) a model with mountains as physical barriers; iii) a model with a continuous or iv) discontinuous perimeter barrier as control interventions surrounding the infested area. Barriers were assumed to be totally impermeable, so they should be interpreted as areas without host plants and in which it is not possible for infected vectors or propagating plant material to pass through. Inference and prediction were performed through the integrated nested Laplace approximation methodology and the stochastic partial differential equation approach. In the stationary model the posterior mean of the spatial range was 4,030.17 m 95% CI (2,907.41, 5,563.88), meaning that host plants that are closer to an infected plant than this distance would be at risk for X. fastidiosa. This distance can be used to define the buffer zone around the infested area in Alicante. In the non-stationary models, the posterior mean of the spatial range varied from 3,860.88 m 95% CI (2,918.61, 5,212.18) in the mountain barrier model to 6,141.08 m 95% CI (4,296.32, 9,042.99) in the continuous barrier model. Compared with the stationary model, the perimeter barrier models decreased the probability of X. fastidiosa presence in the area outside the barrier. Differences between the discontinuous and continuous barrier models showed that breaks in areas with low sampling intensity resulted in a higher probability of X. fastidiosa presence. These results may help authorities prioritize the areas for surveillance and implementation of control measures.",

    "abstract": "Fostering a balanced gut microbiome through the administration of beneficial microbes that can competitively exclude pathogens has gained a lot of attention and use in human and animal medicine. However, little is known about how microbes affect the horizontal gene transfer of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). To shed more light on this question, we challenged neonatal broiler chicks raised on reused broiler chicken litter - a complex environment made up of decomposing pine shavings, feces, uric acid, feathers, and feed, with Salmonella Heidelberg (S. Heidelberg), a model pathogen. Neonatal chicks challenged with S. Heidelberg and raised on reused litter were more resistant to S. Heidelberg cecal colonization than chicks grown on fresh litter. Furthermore, chicks grown on reused litter were at a lower risk of colonization with S. Heidelberg strains that encoded AMR on IncI1 plasmids. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomics to show that the major difference between chicks grown on fresh litter and reused litter was the microbiome harbored in the litter and ceca. The microbiome of reused litter samples was more uniform and enriched in functional pathways related to the biosynthesis of organic and antimicrobial molecules than fresh litter samples. We found that E. coli was the main reservoir of plasmids encoding AMR and that the IncI1 plasmid was maintained at a significantly lower copy per cell in reused litter compared to fresh litter. These findings support the notion that commensal bacteria play an integral role in the horizontal transfer of plasmids encoding AMR to pathogens like Salmonella.\n\nImportance/SignificanceAntimicrobial resistance spread is a worldwide health challenge, stemming in large part, from the ability of microorganisms to share their genetic material through horizontal gene transfer. To address this issue, many countries and international organization have adopted a One health approach to curtail the proliferation of antimicrobial resistant bacteria. This includes the removal and reduction of antibiotics used in food animal production and the development of alternatives to antibiotics. However, there is still a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of how resistance spreads in the absence of antibiotic selection and the role commensal bacteria play in reducing antibiotic resistance transfer. In this study, we show that commensal bacteria play a key role in reducing the horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance to Salmonella and provide the identity of the bacterial species that potentially perform this function in broiler chickens and also postulate the mechanism involved.",

    "abstract": "Promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is a critical step in early transcription elongation for the precise regulation of gene expression. Here, we provide evidence of promoter-proximal pausing-like distributions of RNAPII in S. cerevisiae. We found that genes bearing an alternative pausing site utilize Ino80p to properly localize RNAPII pausing at the first pausing site and to suppress the accumulation of RNAPII at the second pausing site, which is tightly associated with the +1 nucleosome. This alternative pausing site determination was dependent on the remodeling activity of Ino80p to modulate the +1 nucleosome position and might be controlled synergistically with Spt4p. Furthermore, we observed similar Ino80-dependent RNAPII pausing in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Based on our collective results, we hypothesize that the chromatin remodeler Ino80 plays a highly conserved role in regulating early RNAPII elongation to establish intact pausing.",
