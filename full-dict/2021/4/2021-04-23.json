    "abstract": "Defining appropriate null expectations for species distribution hypotheses is important because sampling bias and spatial autocorrelation can produce realistic, but ecologically meaningless, geographic patterns. Generating null species occurrences with similar spatial structure to observed data can help overcome these problems, but existing methods focus on single or pairs of species and do not incorporate between-species spatial structure that may occlude comparative biogeographic analyses. Here, we describe an algorithm for generating randomised species occurrence points that mimic the within- and between-species spatial structure of real datasets and implement it in a new R package - fauxcurrence. The algorithm can be implemented on any geographic domain for any number of species, limited only by computing power. To demonstrate its utility, we apply the algorithm to two common analysis-types: testing the fit of species distribution models (SDMs) and evaluating niche-overlap. The method works well on all tested datasets within reasonable timescales. We found that many SDMs, despite a good fit to the data, were not significantly better than null expectations and identified only two cases (out of a possible 32) of significantly higher niche divergence than expected by chance. The package is user-friendly, flexible and has many potential applications beyond those tested here, such as joint SDM evaluation and species co-occurrence analysis, spanning the areas of ecology, evolutionary biology and biogeography.",

    "abstract": "The climate fluctuations of the Quaternary shaped the movement of species in and out of glacial refugia. In Europe, the majority of species followed one of the described traditional postglacial recolonization routes from the southern peninsulas towards the north. Like most organisms, barn owls are assumed to have colonized the British Isles by crossing over Doggerland, a land bridge that connected Britain to northern Europe. However, while they are dark rufous in northern Europe, barn owls in the British Isles are conspicuously white, a contrast that could suggest selective forces are at play on the islands. However, analysis of known candidate genes involved in colouration found no signature of selection. Instead, using whole genome sequences and species distribution modelling, we found that owls colonised the British Isles soon after the last glaciation, directly from a white coloured refugium in the Iberian Peninsula, before colonising northern Europe. They would have followed a yet unknown post-glacial colonization route to the Isles over a westwards path of suitable habitat in now submerged land in the Bay of Biscay, thus not crossing Doggerland. As such, they inherited the white colour of their Iberian founders and maintained it through low gene flow with the mainland that prevents the import of rufous alleles. Thus, we contend that neutral processes likely explain this contrasting white colour compared to continental owls. With the barn owl being a top predator, we expect future research will show this unanticipated route was used by other species from its paleo community.",

Here, we introduce in situ electro-sequencing (electro-seq), combining soft bioelectronics with in situ RNA sequencing to stably map millisecond-timescale cellular electrophysiology and simultaneously profile a large number of genes at single-cell level across 3D tissues. We applied in situ electro-seq to 3D human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) patches, precisely registering the CM gene expression with electrophysiology at single-cell level, enabling multimodal in situ analysis. Such multimodal data integration substantially improved the dissection of cell types and the reconstruction of developmental trajectory from spatially heterogeneous tissues. Using machine learning (ML)-based cross-modal analysis, in situ electro-seq identified the gene-to-electrophysiology relationship over the time course of cardiac maturation. Further leveraging such a relationship to train a coupled autoencoder, we demonstrated the prediction of single-cell gene expression profile evolution using long-term electrical measurement from the same cardiac patch or 3D millimeter-scale cardiac organoids. As exemplified by cardiac tissue maturation, in situ electro-seq will be broadly applicable to create spatiotemporal multimodal maps and predictive models in electrogenic organs, allowing discovery of cell types and gene programs responsible for electrophysiological function and dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The idea that information can be transmitted to subsequent generation(s) by epigenetic means has been studied for decades but remains controversial in humans. Epidemiological studies have established that grandparental exposures are associated with health outcomes in their grandchildren, often with sex-specific effects; however the mechanism of transmission is still unclear. We conducted Epigenome Wide Association Studies (EWAS) to test whether grandmaternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with altered DNA methylation (DNAm) in their adolescent grandchildren. We used data from a birth cohort, with discovery and replication datasets of 1225 and 708 individuals (respectively), aged 15-17 years, and tested replication in the same individuals at birth and 7 years. We show for the first time that DNAm at a small number of loci is associated with grandmaternal smoking in humans, and their locations in the genome suggest hypotheses of transmission. We observe and replicate sex-specific associations at two sites on the X chromosome, one located in an imprinting control region and both within transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). In fact, we observe enrichment for TFBSs among the CpG sites with the strongest associations, suggesting that TFBSs may be a mechanism by which grandmaternal exposures influence offspring DNA methylation. There is limited evidence that these associations appear at earlier timepoints, so effects are not static throughout development. The implication of this work is that effects of smoking during pregnancy may induce DNAm changes in later generations and that these changes are often sex-specific, in line with observational associations.",

While many methods have been developed, their performance has been limited. Recent progress in machine learning and availability of large-scale population genomic sequencing data provide new opportunities to significantly improve computational predictions. Here we describe gMVP, a new method based on graph attention neural networks. Its main component is a graph with nodes capturing predictive features of amino acids and edges weighted by coevolution strength, which enables effective pooling of information from local protein context and functionally correlated distal positions. Evaluated by deep mutational scan data, gMVP outperforms published methods in identifying damaging variants in TP53, PTEN, BRCA1, and MSH2. Additionally, it achieves the best separation of de novo missense variants in neurodevelopmental disorder cases from the ones in controls. Finally, the model supports transfer learning to optimize gain- and loss-of-function predictions in sodium and calcium channels. In summary, we demonstrate that gMVP can improve interpretation of missense variants in clinical testing and genetic studies.",

    "abstract": "Animals detect approaching predators via sensory inputs through various modalities and immediately show an appropriate behavioral response to survive. Escape behavior is essential to avoid the predators attack and is more frequently observed than other defensive behaviors. In some species, multiple escape responses are exhibited with different movements. It has been reported that the approaching speed of a predator is important in choosing which escape action to take among the multiple responses. However, it is unknown whether other aspects of sensory stimuli, that indicate the predators approach, affect the selection of escape responses. We focused on two distinct escape responses (running and jumping) to a stimulus (short airflow) in crickets and examined the effects of multiple stimulus aspects (including the angle, velocity, and duration) on the choice between these escape responses. We found that the faster and longer the airflow, the more frequently the crickets jumped, meaning that they could choose their escape response depending on both velocity and duration of the stimulus. This result suggests that the neural basis for choosing escape responses includes the integration process of multiple stimulus parameters. It was also found that the moving speed and distance changed depending on the stimulus velocity and duration during running but not during jumping, suggesting higher adaptability of the running escape. In contrast, the movement direction was accurately controlled regardless of the stimulus parameters in both responses. The escape direction depended only on stimulus orientation, but not on velocity and duration.\n\nSummary statementWhen air currents triggering escape are faster and longer, crickets more frequently jump than run. Running speed and distance depend on stimulus velocity and duration, but direction control is independent.",

    "abstract": "Image-based cell phenotyping relies on quantitative measurements as encoded representations of cells; however, defining suitable representations that capture complex imaging features is challenged by the lack of robust methods to segment cells, identify subcellular compartments, and extract relevant features. Variational autoencoder (VAE) approaches produce encouraging results by mapping an image to a representative descriptor, and outperform classical hand-crafted features for morphology, intensity, and texture at differentiating data. Although VAEs show promising results for capturing morphological and organizational features in tissue, single cell image analyses based on VAEs often fail to identify biologically informative features due to uninformative technical variation. Herein, we propose a multi-encoder VAE (ME-VAE) in single cell image analysis using transformed images as a self-supervised signal to extract transform-invariant biologically meaningful features, including emergent features not obvious from prior knowledge. We show that the proposed architecture improves analysis by making distinct cell populations more separable compared to traditional VAEs and intensity measurements by enhancing phenotypic differences between cells and by improving correlations to other analytic modalities.",

Infection occurs when these biflagellated zoospores move across the soil at their characteristic high speed and reach the roots of a host plant. Despite the relevance of zoospore spreading in the epidemics of plant diseases, characteristics of individual swimming of zoospores have not been fully investigated. It remains unknown about the characteristics of two opposite beating flagella during translation and turning, and the roles of each flagellum on zoospore swimming. Here, combining experiments and modeling, we show how these two flagella contribute to generate thrust when beating together, and identify the mastigonemes-attached anterior flagellum as the main source of thrust. Furthermore, we find that turning involves a complex active process, in which the posterior flagellum temporarily stops, while the anterior flagellum keeps on beating and changes its pattern from sinusoidal waves to power and recovery strokes, similar to Chlamydomonass breaststroke, to reorient its body to a new direction. Our study is a fundamental step towards a better understanding of the spreading of plant pathogens motile forms, and shows that the motility pattern of these biflagellated zoospores represents a distinct eukaryotic version of the celebrated \"run-and-tumble\" motility class exhibited by peritrichous bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Fish in coastal ecosystems can be exposed to acute variations in CO2 that can approach 1 kPa CO2 (10,000 atm). Coping with this environmental challenge will depend on the ability to rapidly compensate the internal acid-base disturbance caused by sudden exposure to high environmental CO2 (blood and tissue acidosis); however, studies about the speed of acid-base regulatory responses in marine fish are scarce. We observed that upon exposure to ~1 kPa CO2, European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) completely regulate erythrocyte intracellular pH within ~40 minutes, thus restoring haemoglobin-O2 affinity to pre-exposure levels. Moreover, blood pH returned to normal levels within ~2 hours, which is one of the fastest acid-base recoveries documented in any fish. This was achieved via a large upregulation of net acid excretion and accumulation of HCO3- in blood, which increased from ~4 to ~22 mM. While the abundance and intracellular localisation of gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) remained unchanged, the apical surface area of acid-excreting gill ionocytes doubled. This constitutes a novel mechanism for rapidly increasing acid excretion during sudden blood acidosis. Rapid acid-base regulation was completely prevented when the same high CO2 exposure occurred in seawater with experimentally reduced HCO3- and pH, likely because reduced environmental pH inhibited gill H+ excretion via NHE3. The rapid and robust acid-base regulatory responses identified will enable European sea bass to maintain physiological performance during large and sudden CO2 fluctuations that naturally occur in coastal environments.\n\nSummary statementEuropean sea bass exposed to 1 kPa (10,000 atm) CO2 regulate blood and red cell pH within 2 hours and 40 minutes, respectively, protecting O2 transport capacity, via enhanced gill acid excretion.",

At the molecular level, we identify the RNA-binding protein Myef2 as a novel PARylated target which we show controls OPC differentiation through PARylation-modulated de-repression of myelin protein expression. Furthermore, PARP1s enzymatic activity is necessary for oligodendrocyte and myelin regeneration after demyelination. Together, our findings suggest that PARP1-mediated PARylation activity may be a potential therapeutic target for promoting OPC differentiation and remyelination in neurological disorders characterized by arrested OPC differentiation and remyelination failure such as multiple sclerosis.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the EEG spectral feature modulations associated with fatigue induced by robot-mediated upper limb gross motor and fine motor interactions. Twenty healthy participants were randomly assigned to either perform a gross motor interaction with HapticMASTER or a fine motor interaction with SCRIPT passive orthosis for 20 minutes or until volitional fatigue. EEG relative and ratio band power measures were estimated from the data recorded before and after the interactions. Paired-samples t-tests found a significant increase in relative alpha band power on FC3, C3, P3 electrodes, and ({theta} + )/{beta} and /{beta} on C3 electrode following the gross motor interaction. Conversely, relative delta band power on C3 significantly decreased. A significant increase in relative alpha band power on FP1, C3 electrodes and relative theta band power on C4 electrode were found following the fine motor interaction whereas relative delta band power on FP1 electrode significantly decreased. Most participants reported an increase in their physical fatigue level following the gross movements and an increase in their mental fatigue level following the fine movements. Findings affirm that changes to localised brain activity patterns are an indication of fatigue developed from the robot-mediated interactions. It can be concluded that regional differences in the prominent EEG spectral features are most likely due to the differences in the nature of the task (fine/gross motor and distal/proximal upper limb) that may have differently altered an individuals physical and mental fatigue level. The findings could potentially be utilised to monitor and moderate fatigue during robot-mediated post-stroke therapies.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the pathophysiology of Parkinsons disease has been hampered by the lack of models that recapitulate all the critical factors underlying its development. Here, we generated functional induced dopaminergic neurons (iDANs) that were directly reprogrammed from adult human dermal fibroblasts of patients with idiopathic Parkinsons disease to investigate diseaserelevant pathology. We show that iDANs derived from Parkinsons disease patients exhibit lower basal chaperone-mediated autophagy as compared to iDANs of healthy donors. Furthermore, stress-induced autophagy resulted in an accumulation of macroautophagic structures in induced neurons (iNs) derived from Parkinsons disease patients, independently of the specific neuronal subtype but dependent on the age of the donor. Finally, we found that these impairments in patient-derived iNs lead to an accumulation of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein, a hallmark of Parkinsons disease pathology. Taken together, our results demonstrate that direct neural reprogramming provides a patient-specific model to study aged neuronal features relevant to idiopathic Parkinsons disease.",

    "abstract": "Chronic and acute stress differentially affect behaviour, as well as the structural integrity of the hippocampus, a key brain region involved in cognition and memory. However, it remains unclear if and how the facilitatory effects of acute stress on hippocampal information coding are disrupted as the stress becomes chronic. To examine this, we compared the impact of acute and chronic stress on neural activity in the CA1 subregion of male mice subjected to a chronic immobilization stress paradigm. We observed that following first exposure to stress (acute stress), the spatial information encoded in the hippocampus sharpened and the neurons became increasingly tuned to the underlying theta oscillation in the local field potential (LFP). However, following repeated exposure to same stress (chronic stress), spatial tuning was poorer and the power of both the slow-gamma (30-50 Hz) and fast-gamma (55-90 Hz) oscillations, which correlate with excitatory inputs into the region, decreased. These results support the idea that acute and chronic stress differentially affect neural computations carried out by hippocampal circuits and suggest that acute stress may improve cognitive processing.",

    "abstract": "Increased dietary fiber consumption has been shown to increase human gut microbial diversity, but the mechanisms driving this effect remain unclear. One possible explanation is that microbes are able to divide metabolic labor in consumption of complex carbohydrates, which are composed of diverse glycosidic linkages that require specific cognate enzymes for degradation. However, as naturally derived fibers vary in both sugar composition and linkage structure, it is challenging to separate out the impact of each of these variables. We hypothesized that fine differences in carbohydrate linkage structure would govern microbial community structure and function independently of variation in glycosyl residue composition. To test this hypothesis, we fermented commercially available soluble resistant glucans, which are uniformly composed of glucose linked in different structural arrangements, in vitro with fecal inocula from each of three individuals. We measured metabolic outputs (pH, gas, and short-chain fatty acid production) and community structure via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We determined that community metabolic outputs from identical glucans were highly individual, emerging from divergent initial microbiome structures. However, specific operational taxonomic units responded similarly in growth responses across individuals microbiota, though in context-dependent ways; these data suggested that certain taxa were more efficient in competing for some structures than others. Together, these data support the hypothesis that variation in linkage structure, independent of sugar composition, governs compositional and functional responses of microbiota.\n\nImportancePrevious studies have reported how physical and chemical structures of carbohydrates influence the gut microbiota, however, variability across dietary fibers in monosaccharide composition and linkage structure obscures the relationship between fine polysaccharide linkage structure and microbial fitness. Revealing connections between subtle differences in glucan structure and microbial composition and metabolic responses, this study suggests much greater attention to substrate structure in the design of experiments to test fiber-microbiome responses in vitro and in vivo. Further, it underscores that, although microbiome responses to distinct fibers are individual and vary among specific glucans, similar carbohydrate structure-microbe relationships occur across individual donor communities. Together, these data may help explain why some individuals may respond (while others do not) to fiber treatments in human feeding trials and support the long-term goal of rational inclusion of specific fibers in dietary patterns to modulate the gut microbiome in support of health.",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms commonly use two-component systems (TCSs) to detect specific environmental changes and respond accordingly for their own benefit. However, the regulatory mechanisms and physiological roles of a majority of TCSs are still elusive. In this study, we focused on a previously predicted TCS FleS/FleR in Pseudomonas aeruginosa to systematically investigate its regulation and physiological roles. Loss of fleS or fleR or both genes led to decreased biofilm formation and attenuated motility in PAO1, which could be restored by heterologously complementation of FleR but not FleS, confirming that the sensor kinase FleS and the response regulator FleR constitute a TCS pair. To determine the regulatory spectrum of this TCS, we conducted transcriptome sequencing and comparison between the wild-type strain and the fleR deletion mutant. The result showed that the TCS regulates about 440 genes including most of them are involved in the virulence-related pathways, e.g. siderophore biosynthesis, pyocyanin biosynthesis, type III/VI secretion systems, c-di-GMP metabolism, flagellar assembly etc. In addition to its roles in controlling biofilm formation and motility we have already shown, FleR was demonstrated to regulate the production of virulence factors such as pyocyanin and elastase, mediate stress response to SDS, and autoregulate its own expression. Moreover, EMSA assays revealed that FleR regulates flagellum biosynthesis genes flgBCDE, flgFGHIJKL, filC, which are essential for the bacterial motility, by directly interacting with their promoters. Taken together, these results expanded our understanding on the biological roles of FleS/FleR and provided new insights on its regulatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "In metazoans, heritable states of cell type specific gene expression patterns linked with specialization of various cell types constitute transcriptional cellular memory. Evolutionarily conserved Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) proteins contribute to the transcriptional cellular memory by maintaining heritable patterns of repressed and active expression states, respectively. Although chromatin structure and modifications appear to play a fundamental role in maintenance of repression by PcG, the precise targeting mechanism and the specificity factors that bind PcG complexes to a defined region in chromosomes remain elusive. Here we report a serendipitous discovery that uncovers a direct molecular interaction between Polycomb (PC) and TCP-1 Ring Complex (TRiC) chaperonin subunit, Tcp-1{eta} in Drosophila. Tcp-1{eta} interacts with PC at chromatin to maintain repressed states of homeotic and non-homeotic targets of PcG, which supports a strong genetic interaction observed between Pc and Tcp-1{eta} mutants. Depletion of Tcp-1{eta} results in dissociation of PC from chromatin and redistribution of an abundant amount of PC in cytoplasm. We propose that Tcp-1{eta} is an important modulator of PC, which helps PC recruitment at chromatin and compromising Tcp-1{eta} can directly influence an evolutionary highly conserved epigenetic network that supervises the appropriate cellular identities during development and homoeostasis of an organism.\n\nSignificance StatementSilencing of key developmental genes, e.g, Hox genes, by PcG is a hallmark of differential gene expression patterns associated with cell fate determination. Here we describe a previously unknown molecular and genetic interaction of Polycomb (PC) with Tcp-1{eta} subunit of TRiC chaperonin complex in Drosophila. Compromising Tcp-1{eta} function results in de-repression of PcG targets and a concomitant loss of PC from chromatin. Moreover, depletion of Tcp-1{eta} leads to redistribution of PC in cytoplasm. Molecular interaction of PC with Tcp-1{eta} highlights a novel factor which helps PC recruitment at chromatin. We propose that Tcp-1{eta} chaperonin is one of the specificity factors and part of the targeting mechanism that binds PC to specific regions on chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveLow-intensity ultrasound can stimulate excitable cells in a noninvasive and targeted manner, but which parameters are effective has remained elusive. This question has been difficult to answer because differences in transducers and parameters--frequency in particular--lead to profound differences in the stimulated tissue volumes. The objective of this study is to control for these differences and evaluate which ultrasound parameters are effective in stimulating excitable cells.\n\nMethodsHere, we stimulated the human peripheral nervous system using a single transducer operating in a range of frequencies, and matched the stimulated volumes with an acoustic aperture.\n\nResultsWe found that low frequencies (300 kHz) are substantially more effective in generating tactile and nociceptive responses in humans compared to high frequencies (900 kHz). The strong effect of ultrasound frequency was observed for all pressures tested, for continuous and pulsed stimuli, and for tactile and nociceptive responses.\n\nConclusionThis prominent effect may be explained by a mechanical force associated with ultrasound. The effect is not due to heating, which would be weaker at the low frequency.\n\nSignificanceThis controlled study reveals that ultrasonic stimulation of excitable cells is stronger at lower frequencies, which guides the choice of transducer hardware for effective ultrasonic stimulation of the peripheral nervous system in humans.",

    "abstract": "Mirror overflow is involuntary movement that accompanies unilateral voluntary movement on the opposite side of the body, and is commonly seen in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Children with ADHD show asymmetry in mirror overflow between dominant and non-dominant hand, yet there are competing mechanistic accounts of why this occurs. Using EEG during a sequential, unimanual finger-tapping task, we found that children with ADHD exhibited significantly more mirror overflow than typically developing (TD) controls, especially during the tapping of the non-dominant hand. Furthermore, source-level EEG oscillation analysis revealed that children with ADHD showed decreased alpha (8-12 Hz) event-related desynchronization (ERD) compared with controls in both hemispheres, but only during tapping of the non-dominant hand. Moreover, only the ERD ipsilateral to the mirror overflow during non-dominant hand movement correlated with both magnitude of overflow movements and higher ADHD symptom severity (Conners ADHD Hyperactivity/Impulsiveness scale) in children with ADHD. TD controls did not show these relationships. Our findings suggest that EEG differences in finger-tapping in ADHD are related primarily to voluntary movement in the non-dominant hand. Our results are also consistent with the Ipsilateral Corticospinal Tract (CST) Hypothesis, which posits that the atypical persistence of mirror overflow in ADHD may originate in the sensorimotor areas ipsilateral to mirror overflow and be transmitted via non-decussating CST fibers.",

    "abstract": "DNA double strand break (DSB) repair by Homologous recombination (HR) is initiated by the end resection, a process during which 3 ssDNA overhangs are generated by the nucleolytic degradation. The extent of DNA end resection determines the choice of the DSB repair pathway. The role of several proteins including nucleases for end resection has been studied in detail. However, it is still unclear how the initial, nicked DNA generated by MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 is recognized and how subsequent proteins including EXO1 are recruited to DSB sites to facilitate extensive end resection. We found that the MutS{beta} (MSH2-MSH3) mismatch repair (MMR) complex is recruited to DSB sites by recognizing the initial nicked DNA at DSB sites through the interaction with the chromatin remodeling protein SMARCAD1. MSH2-MSH3 at DSB sites helps to recruit EXO1 for long-range resection and enhances its enzymatic activity. MSH2-MSH3 furthermore inhibits the access of DNA polymerase {theta} (POLQ), which promotes polymerase theta-mediated end-joining (TMEJ) of DSB. Collectively, our data show a direct role for MSH2-MSH3 in the initial stages of DSB repair by promoting end resection and influencing DSB repair pathway by favoring HR over TMEJ. Our findings extend the importance of MMR in DSB repair beyond established role in rejecting the invasion of sequences not perfectly homologous to template DNA during late-stage HR.",

    "abstract": "Errors in mitosis that cause chromosome missegregation lead to aneuploidy and micronuclei formation which are associated with cancer. Accurate segregation requires the alignment of all chromosomes by the mitotic spindle at the metaphase plate, and any misalignment must be corrected before anaphase is triggered. The spindle is situated in a membrane-free \"exclusion zone\", beyond this zone, endomembranes (endoplasmic reticulum, nuclear envelope and other organelles) are densely packed. We asked what happens to misaligned chromosomes that find themselves beyond the exclusion zone? Here we show that such chromosomes become ensheathed in multiple layers of endomembranes. Chromosome ensheathing delays mitosis and increases the frequency of chromosome missegregation. The micronuclei that form following missegregation have a disrupted nuclear envelope with internal endomembranes. We use an induced organelle relocalization strategy in live cells to show that clearance of endomembranes allows for the rescue of chromosomes that were destined for missegregation. Our findings indicate that endomembranes promote the missegregation of misaligned chromosomes that are outside the exclusion zone, and therefore constitute a risk factor for aneuploidy.",

Due to high rate of mortality specifically in India and Bangladesh, there is an urgent need for accelerated research for NiV involving the development of vaccines or drugs. The genome of NiV consists of six genes (N, P, M, F, G and L) encoding yielding nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrix, fusion, glycoprotein and large RNA polymerase. We have used these six genes for in silico assessment of DNA codon optimization in Escherichia coli. It was observed that the codon adaptation index (CAI) and GC content of the genes in optimized DNA were enhanced significantly as compared to wild-type strain. On an average, CAI and GC content of N gene in optimized DNA was enhanced by 2.3 (135.1%) and 1.2(9.9 %) fold respectively, while in P/V/C it was increased by 2.0 (98.3 %) and 1.1(7.8%) fold respectively. Further, the CAI and GC content in optimized DNA of M gene and F gene was enhanced by 2.0(99.0%) and 1.1(7.2%) fold respectively for gene M and 2.4(142.5 %), 1.2(15.4%) fold respectively for gene F.

In recent years, extensive (epi-)genomic profiling efforts have identified several molecular groups of ependymoma that are characterized by distinct molecular alterations and/or patterns. Based on unsupervised visualization of a large cohort of genome-wide DNA methylation data, we identified a highly distinct group of pediatric-type tumors (n = 40) forming a cluster separate from all established CNS tumor types, of which a high proportion were histopathologically diagnosed as ependymoma. RNA sequencing revealed recurrent fusions involving the pleomorphic adenoma gene-like 1 (PLAGL1) gene in 19 of 20 of the samples analyzed, with the most common fusion being EWSR1:PLAGL1 (n = 13). Five tumors showed a PLAGL1:FOXO1 fusion and one a PLAGL1:EP300 fusion. High transcript levels of PLAGL1 were noted in these tumors, with concurrent overexpression of the imprinted genes H19 and IGF2, which are regulated by PLAGL1. Histopathological review of cases with sufficient material (n = 16) demonstrated a broad morphological spectrum of largely ependymoma-like tumors. Immunohistochemically, tumors were GFAP-positive and OLIG2- and SOX10-negative. In 3/16 of the cases, a dot-like positivity for EMA was detected. Consistent with other fusion-positive ependymal groups, all tumors in our series were located in the supratentorial compartment. Median age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 6.2 years. Analysis of time to progression or recurrence revealed survival times comparable to those of patients with ZFTA:RELA-fused ependymoma. In summary, our findings suggest the existence of a novel group of supratentorial ependymomas that are characterized by recurrent PLAGL1 fusions and enriched for pediatric patients.",

    "abstract": "\"Undruggable\" proteins, such as RAS proteins, remain problematic despite efforts to discover inhibitors against them. KRAS mutants are prevalent in human cancers. Recently, the KRAS G12C inhibitor have been clinically approved, but inhibitors for KRAS G12D/V are still under development. Here, we described the development of a novel chemical knockdown strategy, termed CANDDY (Chemical knockdown with Affinity aNd Degradation DYnamics). This strategy involves a CANDDY tag modified from a proteasome inhibitor inducing direct proteasomal degradation. We constructed TUS-007 as a multispecific small molecule tethered from a KRAS interactor and CANDDY tag to target KRAS G12D/V. We confirmed that the degradation by TUS-007 was independent of target ubiquitination. This allows to solve a laborious design of matchmaker in the current ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis technology. And TUS-007 successfully suppressed tumors due to in vivo degradation of KRAS G12D/V. The CANDDY technology could represent a simple and rational strategy to degrade currently \"undruggable\" proteins.",

However, it is unclear whether hippocampal event memories reflect temporal relations derived from mnemonic constructions, event order, or elapsing time, and whether these sequence representations generalize temporal relations across similar sequences. Here, participants mnemonically constructed times of events from multiple sequences using infrequent cues and their experience of passing time. After learning, event representations in the anterior hippocampus reflected temporal relations based on constructed times. Temporal relations were generalized across sequences, revealing distinct representational formats for events from the same or different sequences. Structural knowledge about time patterns, abstracted from different sequences, biased the construction of specific event times. These findings demonstrate that mnemonic construction and the generalization of relational knowledge combine in the hippocampus, consistent with the simulation of scenarios from episodic details and structural knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence indicates that microglia impact brain function by regulating synaptic pruning and formation, as well as synaptic transmission and plasticity. Iba1 (Ionized Ca+2-binding adapter protein 1), encoded by the Allograft inflammatory factor 1 (Aif1) gene, is an actin-interacting protein in microglia. Although Iba1 has long been used as a cellular marker for microglia, its functional role remains unknown. Here, we used global Iba1-deficient (Aif1-/-) mice to characterize microglial activity, synaptic function and behavior. Microglial imaging in acute hippocampal slices and fixed tissues from juvenile mice revealed that Aif1-/- microglia display reductions in ATP-induced motility and ramification, respectively. Biochemical assays further demonstrated that Aif1-/- brain tissues exhibit an altered expression of microglial-enriched proteins associated with synaptic pruning. Consistent with these changes, juvenile Aif1-/- mice displayed deficits in excitatory synapse number and synaptic transmission assessed by neuronal labeling and whole-cell patch-clamp recording in acute hippocampal slices. Unexpectedly, microglial synaptic engulfment capacity was diminished in juvenile Aif1-/- mice. During early postnatal development when synapse formation is a predominant event in the hippocampus, excitatory synapse number was still reduced in Aif1-/- mice. Together these findings support an overall role of Iba1 in excitatory synaptic growth in juvenile mice. Lastly, postnatal synaptic deficits persisted in the adulthood and correlated with significant behavioral changes in adult Aif1-/- mice, which exhibited impairments in object recognition memory and social interaction. These results suggest that Iba1 critically contributes to microglial activity underlying essential neuro-glia developmental processes that may deeply influence behavior.\n\nSignificanceAbnormal microglia-neuron interaction is increasingly implicated in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, as well as in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers disease. This study demonstrates that deletion of the microglia-specific protein Iba1, which has long been utilized as a selective microglial marker but whose role has remained unidentified, results in microglial structural and functional impairments that significantly impact synaptic development and behavior. These findings not only highlight the importance of microglia in brain function but may also suggest that modifying microglial function could provide a therapeutic strategy for treatment of neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "In the olfactory bulb (OB), mitral cells (MCs) display a spontaneous firing that is characterized by bursts of action potentials intermixed with silent periods. Burst firing frequency and duration are heterogeneous among MCs and increase with membrane depolarization. By using patch clamp recording on rat slices, we dissected out the intrinsic properties responsible of this activity. We showed that the threshold of action potential (AP) generation dynamically changes as a function of the trajectory of the membrane potential; becoming more negative when the membrane was hyperpolarized and having a recovering rate, inversely proportional to the membrane repolarization rate. Such variations appeared to be produced by changes in the inactivation state of voltage dependent Na+ channels. Thus, the modification AP threshold favours the initiation of the burst following hyperpolarizing event such as negative membrane oscillations or inhibitory transmission. After the first AP, the following afterhyperpolarization (AHP) brought the threshold just below the membrane resting potential or within membrane oscillations and, as a consequence, the threshold was exceeded during the fast repolarization component of the AHP. In this way the fast AHP acts as a regenerative mechanism that sustains the firing. Bursts were stopped by the development of a slow repolarization component of the AHP. The AHP characteristics appeared as determining the bursting properties; AHP with larger amplitudes and faster repolarizations being associated with longer and higher frequency bursts. Thus, the increase of bursts length and frequency upon membrane depolarization would be attributable to the modifications of the AHP and of Na+ channels inactivation.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) plays a critical role in retinal physiology, including resetting of the retinal circadian clock that in turn regulates DA release. DA acts on major classes of retinal cells by reconfiguring electrical and chemical synapses. Although a bidirectional regulation between intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin ganglion cells (ipRGCs) and dopaminergic cells has been demonstrated during development and adulthood, DA involvement in the ontogeny of the retinal clock is still unknown.\n\nUsing wild-type Per2Luc and melanopsin knockout (Opn4-/-::Per2Luc) mice at different postnatal stages, we found that the retina can generate self-sustained circadian rhythms from postnatal day 5 that emerge in the absence of external time cues in both genotypes. Intriguingly, DA lengthens the endogenous period only in wild-type retinas, suggesting that this desynchronizing effect requires melanopsin. Furthermore, blockade of cholinergic retinal waves in wild-type retinas induces a shortening of the period, similarly to Opn4-/-::Per2Luc explants. Altogether, these data suggest that DA desynchronizes the retinal clock through a melanopsin-dependent regulation of acetylcholine retinal waves, thus offering a new role of melanopsin in setting the period of the retinal clock during development.",

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) have great potential in the surveillance of AMR genes. However, molecular methods are dependent upon the isolation of high-quality DNA yields. Currently, there is no consensus for the optimum DNA extraction strategies from complex environmental matrices for downstream molecular applications.\n\nMethodsWe present a novel magnetic bead-based method for the isolation of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) from river water in Malawi, named MagnaExtract. We present this with analytic limit of detection (LOD) as well as a case study in Southern Malawi. Here we compare the DNA yield and subsequent PCR output from MagnaExtract with commercially available QIAGEN kits and the crude boil and spin method, utilising a high-resolution melt analysis (HRM) PCR panel designed for the detection of third generation cephalosporin and carbapenem resistant genes.\n\nResultsOf the 98 water samples evaluated we found the MagnaExtract method to be comparable, and in some instances superior to commercially available kits for the isolation of ARGs from river water samples. In addition, we found overnight incubation to promote the recovery of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes and simultaneous reduction in the detection of carbapenemase genes.\n\nConclusionThe MagnaExtract approach offers a simple, affordable, high yielding extraction method that could be used for the detection of ARGs isolated from river water samples in environmental surveillance campaigns in East Africa.",

    "abstract": "Grasspea is a popular pulse crop due to its hardiness and low cost of production. Presence of anti-nutritive factor  {beta}-ODAP in its seeds and other plant parts hinder its widespread cultivation and usage. Oxalyl-CoA synthetase is one of the key enzyme of {beta}-ODAP biosynthesis pathway, catalyses the conversion of oxalate to oxalyl-CoA. ACYL ACTIVATING ENZYME 3 (AAE3) gene has been characterised to encode an oxalyl-CoA synthetase enzyme in many plant species. We report here the isolation of full length AAE3 homolog in grasspea with a combination of PCR based strategy and in silico analysis. We first identified AAE3 homolog by PCR using degenerate primers. The partial LsAAE3 sequence showed 88% amino acids sequence identity with the characterised AAE3 gene of M. truncatula. We then predicted the full length AAE3 sequence using the publically available transcriptome datasets of grasspea. Determination of LsAAE3 gene and protein structure and phylogenetic relationship analysis strongly suggested that LsAAE3 is a true homolog of AAE3 gene. Expression profiling of LsAAE3 in grasspea varieties with contrast in {beta}-ODAP content revealed its inverse relationship with the {beta}-ODAP content, LsAAE3 thus negatively regulates the synthesis of {beta}-ODAP. Involvement of AAE3 encoded oxalyl-CoA synthetase in a CoA-dependent pathway of oxalate degradation is well proven in many plant species. We also identified the CoA-dependent pathway of oxalate degradation in grasspea. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that LsAAE3 may regulate {beta}-ODAP content, possibly, by CoA-dependent pathway of oxalate degradation in grasspea. If this hypothesis is substantiated, genetic manipulation of LsAAE3 presents viable option for reducing {beta}-ODAP content in grass pea.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia bacteria are maternally transmitted intracellular microbes that are not only restricted to the reproductive organs but also found in various somatic tissues of their native hosts. The abundance of the endosymbiont in somatic tissues, usually a dead end for vertically transmitted bacteria, causes a multitude of effects on life history traits of their hosts, which are still not well understood. Thus, deciphering the host-symbiont interactions on a cellular level throughout a hosts lifecycle is of great importance to understand their homeostatic nature, persistence and spreading success. Using fluorescent and transmission electron microscopy, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of Wolbachia tropism in somatic and reproductive tissues of six Drosophila species at the intracellular level during host development. Our data uncovered diagnostic patterns of infections to embryonic primordial germ cells and to particular cells of somatic tissues in three different neotropical Drosophila species of the willistoni and saltans groups that have apparently evolved in both independently. We further found that restricted patterns of Wolbachia tropism are already determined in early fly embryogenesis. This is achieved via selective autophagy, and the restriction of infection is preserved through larval hatching and metamorphosis. We further uncovered tight interactions of Wolbachia with membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, which might play a scaffolding role for autophagosome formation and subsequent elimination of the endosymbiont. Finally, by analyzing D. simulans lines transinfected with non-native Wolbachia, we uncovered that the host genetic background regulates tissue tropism of infection. Our data demonstrate a peculiar and novel mechanism to limit and spatially restrict bacterial infection in somatic tissues during a very early stage of host development.",

Fortunately, this gap can be filled by coupling modern molecular tools with indirect sampling methods. In this note we test if whale watching activities, which represent an intense observation effort worldwide, could be a source of material for studies of cetacean-cephalopod interactions.

To evaluate if long-term cooperative relationships in vampire bats play a role in foraging, we tested if foraging encounters measured by proximity sensors could be explained by wild roosting proximity, kinship, or rates of co-feeding, social grooming, and food sharing during 22 months in captivity. We assessed evidence for six hypothetical scenarios of social foraging, ranging from individual to collective hunting. We found that female vampire bats departed their roost individually, but often re-united far outside the roost. Nonrandomly repeating foraging encounters were predicted by within-roost association and histories of cooperation in captivity, even when controlling for kinship. Foraging bats demonstrated both affiliative and competitive interactions and a previously undescribed call type. We suggest that social foraging could have implications for social evolution if  local cooperation within the roost and  global competition outside the roost enhances fitness interdependence between frequent roostmates.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is an obligate ectoparasitic copepod, living on Atlantic salmon and other salmonids in the marine environment. Salmon lice cause a number of environmental problems and lead to large economical losses in aquaculture every year. In order to develop novel parasite control strategies, a better understanding of the mechanisms of moulting and development of the salmon louse at the transcriptional level is required.\n\nMethodsThree weighted gene co-expression networks were constructed based on the pairwise correlations of salmon louse gene expression profiles at different life stages. Network-based approaches and gene annotation information were applied to identify genes that might be important for the moulting and development of the salmon louse. RNA interference was performed for validation. Regulatory impact factors were calculated for all the transcription factor genes by examining the changes in co-expression patterns between transcription factor genes and deferentially expressed genes in middle stages and moulting stages.\n\nResultsEight gene modules were predicted as important, and 10 genes from six of the eight modules have been found to show observable phenotypes in RNA interference experiments. We knocked down five hub genes from three modules and observed phenotypic consequences in all experiments. In the infection trial, no copepodids with the RAB1A-like gene knocked down were found on fish, while control samples developed to chalimus-1 larvae. Also, a FOXO-like gene obtained highest scores in the regulatory impact factor calculation.\n\nConclusionsWe propose a gene co-expression network-based approach to identify genes playing an important role in the moulting and development of salmon louse. The RNA interference experiments confirmed the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrated the indispensable role of RAB1A-like gene in the development of salmon louse. In addition to salmon louse, this approach could be generalized to identify important genes associated with a phenotype of interest in other organisms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRNA-seq is being increasingly adopted for gene expression studies in a panoply of non-model organisms, with applications spanning the fields of agriculture, aquaculture, ecology, and environment. For organisms that lack a well-annotated reference genome or transcriptome, a conventional RNA-seq data analysis workflow requires constructing a de-novo transcriptome assembly and annotating it against a high-confidence protein database. The assembly serves as a reference for read mapping, and the annotation is necessary for functional analysis of genes found to be differentially expressed. However, assembly is computationally expensive. It is also prone to errors that impact expression analysis, especially since sequencing depth is typically much lower for expression studies than for transcript discovery.\n\nResultsWe propose a shortcut, in which we obtain counts for differential expression analysis by directly aligning RNA-seq reads to the high-confidence proteome that would have been otherwise used for annotation. By avoiding assembly, we drastically cut down computational costs - the running time on a typical dataset improves from the order of tens of hours to under half an hour, and the memory requirement is reduced from the order of tens of Gbytes to tens of Mbytes. We show through experiments on simulated and real data that our pipeline not only reduces computational costs, but has higher sensitivity and precision than a typical assembly-based pipeline. A Snakemake implementation of our workflow is available at: https://bitbucket.org/project_samar/samar\n\nConclusionsThe flip side of RNA-seq becoming accessible to even modestly resourced labs has been that the time, labor, and infrastructure cost of bioinformatics analysis has become a bottleneck. Assembly is one such resource-hungry process, and we show here that it can be avoided for quick and easy, yet more sensitive and precise, differential gene expression analysis in non-model organisms.",

    "abstract": "Most legumes can establish a symbiotic association with soil rhizobia that triggers the development of root nodules. These nodules host the rhizobia and allow them to fix nitrogen efficiently. The perception of bacterial lipo-chitooligosaccharide (LCO) signal in the epidermis initiates a signaling cascade that allows rhizobial intracellular infection in the root and de-differentiation and activation of cell division that gives rise to the nodule. Nodule organogenesis and rhizobial infection need to be coupled in space and time for successful nodulation. The plant hormone cytokinin (CK) acts as an essential positive regulator of nodule organogenesis, and specific CK receptors are required for nodule formation. Temporal regulation of tissue-specific CK signaling and biosynthesis in response to LCOs or Sinorhizobium meliloti inoculation in Medicago truncatula remains poorly understood. In the present study, using a fluorescence-based CK sensor (TCSn::nls:tGFP), we performed a high-resolution tissue-specific temporal characterization of the CK responses sequential activation during root infection and nodule development in M. truncatula after inoculation with S. meliloti. Loss-of-function mutants of the CK-biosynthetic gene ISOPENTENYL TRANSFERASE 3 (IPT3) showed impairment of nodulation, suggesting that IPT3 is required for nodule development in M. truncatula. Simultaneous live imaging of pIPT3::tdTOMATO and the CK sensor showed that IPT3 induction in the root stele at the base of nodule primordium contributes to CK biosynthesis, which in turn promotes expression of positive regulators of nodule organogenesis in M. truncatula.\n\nOne-sentence summaryHigh-resolution spatiotemporal imaging of cytokinin signaling reveals IPT3 function during indeterminate nodule development in Medicago truncatula",

    "abstract": "In order to survive sub-zero temperatures, some plants undergo cold acclimation where low, non-freezing temperatures and/or shortened day lengths allow cold hardening and survival during subsequent freeze events. Central to this response is the plasma membrane, where low-temperature is perceived and cellular homeostasis must be preserved by maintaining membrane integrity. Here, we present the first plasma membrane proteome of cold-acclimated Brachypodium distachyon, a model species for the study of monocot crops. A time course experiment investigated cold acclimation-induced changes in the proteome following two-phase partitioning plasma membrane enrichment and label-free quantification by nano-liquid chromatography mass spectrophotometry. Two days of cold acclimation were sufficient for membrane protection as well as an initial increase in sugar levels, and coincided with a significant change in the abundance of 154 proteins. Prolonged cold acclimation resulted in further increases in soluble sugars and abundance changes in more than 680 proteins, suggesting both a necessary early response to low-temperature treatment, as well as a sustained cold acclimation response elicited over several days. A meta-analysis revealed that the identified plasma membrane proteins have known roles in low-temperature tolerance, metabolism, transport, and pathogen defense as well as drought, osmotic stress and salt resistance suggesting crosstalk between stress responses, such that cold acclimation may prime plants for other abiotic and biotic stresses. The plasma membrane proteins identified here present keys to an understanding of cold tolerance in monocot crops and the hope of addressing economic losses associated with modern climate-mediated increases in frost events.",

    "abstract": "Dormice exhibit both inter- and intrageneric variation in cranial and mandibular morphology. Using geometric morphometrics, the form of eight out of nine extant dormouse genera was analysed, to provide a better understanding of the overall morphological variation present within Gliridae. Three genera representing the subfamilies, were studied in more detail. Species-, genus- and family-specific morphological trends are linked with certain habitats and feeding strategies. Smaller dormice show adaptations to a more arboreal lifestyle such as a relatively enlarged braincase and an inferiorly reoriented foramen magnum. Larger dormice show cranial modifications, including clear flattening of the skull and a more posteriorly positioned foramen magnum, hinting towards a more rupicolous lifestyle. Furthermore, specimens inhabiting arid areas appear to have more inflated auditory bullae, whereas other variable features, such as the length of the incisive foramen, were not associated with either size changes nor climatic variables. Lastly, more robust and horizontally orientated zygomatic arches as well as increased robusticity of the molar row appear to be linked with herbivory in dormice, whereas thinner arches and small concave molars are seen in more insectivorous species. This study results in a better understanding of ecological drivers underpinning the morphological divergence present within Gliridae.",

Here, we used computational simulations involving neural networks to define \"lazy\" and \"rich\" coding solutions to this multitasking problem, which trade off learning speed for robustness. During lazy learning the input dimensionality is expanded by random projections to the network hidden layer, whereas in rich learning hidden units acquire structured representations that privilege relevant over irrelevant features. For context-dependent decision-making, one rich solution is to project task representations onto low-dimensional and orthogonal manifolds. Using behavioural testing and neuroimaging in humans, and analysis of neural signals from macaque prefrontal cortex, we report evidence for neural coding patterns in biological brains whose dimensionality and neural geometry are consistent with the rich learning regime.",

However, it remains unclear how stress affects more fine-grained temporal memory, such as episodic events sequences and event times.

In these virtual days, time was scaled and participants could use clock cues to construe the passage of time within a day. We examined whether acute stress would interfere with encoding of episodic event sequences and temporal memory. Our results show that when learning took place directly after a stressor, virtual time estimates were more strongly biased towards a generalized timeline but temporal memory overall was not differentially affected between the stress and control groups. Exploratory analyses suggest that memory accuracy improved in men and deteriorated in women as a function of subjective stress levels following acute stress. In conclusion, acute stress amplified memory generalization but we found no stress related differences in memory accuracy across levels of temporal granularity.",

Through analysis of extant and ancestrally-reconstructed drosophilid olfactory receptors from the Ionotropic Receptor (IR) family, we investigated evolution of two organic acid-sensing receptors, IR75a and IR75b. Despite their low amino acid identity, we identify a common \"hotspot\" in their ligand-binding pocket that has a major effect on changing the specificity of both IRs, as well as at least two distinct functional transitions in IR75a during evolution. Ligand-docking into IR models predicts that the hotspot does not contact odor molecules, suggesting that this residue indirectly influences ligand/receptor interactions. Moreover, we show that odor specificity is refined by changes in additional, receptor-specific sites, including those outside the ligand-binding pocket. Our work reveals how a core, common determinant of ligand-tuning acts within epistatic and allosteric networks of substitutions to lead to functional evolution of olfactory receptors.",

Prolonged optogenetic activation of medial septal glutamatergic neurons drives theta oscillations and locomotion for extended periods of time outlasting the stimulus duration. However, the cellular and circuit mechanisms supporting the maintenance of both theta oscillations and locomotion remain elusive. Specifically, it remains unclear whether the presence of theta oscillations is a necessary prerequisite for locomotion, and whether neuronal activity within the medial septum underlies its persistence. Here we show that a persistent theta oscillation can be induced by a brief transient activation of glutamatergic neurons. Moreover, persistent locomotion is initiated even if the theta oscillation is abolished by blocking synaptic transmission in the medial septum. We observe persistent spiking of medial septal neurons that outlasts the stimulus for several seconds, both in vivo and in vitro. This persistent activity is driven by intrinsic excitability of glutamatergic neurons.",

Cortical electroencephalography (EEG) oscillations act as coordinators to connect different brain regions, and various assemblies of oscillations can form different networks to support different cognitive tasks. Studies have demonstrated that the dysconnectivity of EEG oscillatory networks is related with MDD. In this study, we investigated the oscillatory hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity networks in MDD under a naturalistic and continuous stimuli condition of music listening. With the assumption that the healthy group and the MDD group share similar brain topology from the same stimuli and also retain individual brain topology for group differences, we applied the coupled nonnegative tensor decomposition algorithm on two adjacency tensors with the dimension of time x frequency x connectivity x subject, and imposed double-coupled constraints on spatial and spectral modes. The music-induced oscillatory networks were identified by a correlation analysis approach based on the permutation test between extracted temporal factors and musical features. We obtained three hyperconnectivity networks from the individual features of MDD and three hypoconnectivity networks from common features. The results demonstrated that the dysfunction of oscillation-modulated networks could affect the involvement in music perception for MDD patients. Those oscillatory dysconnectivity networks may provide promising references to reveal the pathoconnectomics of MDD and potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of MDD.",

The mechanisms controlling nuclear protein localisation in the context of stress responses induced upon bacterial infection are still poorly understood. Here we show that the Brucella abortus effectors NyxA and NyxB interfere with the host sentrin specific protease 3 (SENP3), which is essential for intracellular replication. Translocated Nyx effectors directly interact with SENP3 via a defined acidic patch identified from the crystal structure of NyxB, preventing its nucleolar localisation at the late stages of the infection. By sequestering SENP3, the Nyx effectors induce the cytoplasmic accumulation of the nucleolar AAA-ATPase NVL, the large subunit ribosomal protein L5 (RPL5) and the ribophagy receptor NUFIP1 in Nyx-enriched structures in the vicinity of replicating bacteria. This shuttling of ribosomal biogenesis-associated nucleolar proteins is negatively regulated by SENP3 and dependent on the autophagy-initiation protein Beclin1, indicative of a ribophagy-derived process induced during Brucella infection. Our results highlight a new nucleomodulatory function by two unique Brucella effectors, and reveal that SENP3 is a critical regulator of the subcellular localisation of multiple nucleolar proteins during Brucella infection, promoting intracellular replication.",

However, the dynamics of genome exploration by remodelers, and the role of ATP hydrolysis in this process remain unclear. We used live-cell imaging of Drosophila polytene nuclei to monitor Brahma (BRM) remodeler interactions with its chromosomal targets. In parallel, we measured local chromatin condensation and its effect on BRM association. Surprisingly, only a small portion of BRM is bound to chromatin at any given time. BRM binds decondensed chromatin but is excluded from condensed chromatin, limiting its genomic search space. BRM-chromatin interactions are highly dynamic, whereas histone-exchange is limited and much slower. Intriguingly, loss of ATP hydrolysis enhanced chromatin retention and clustering of BRM, which was associated with reduced histone turnover. Thus, ATP hydrolysis couples nucleosome remodeling to remodeler release, driving a continuous transient probing of the genome.",

    "abstract": "Tau protein has been extensively studied due to its key roles in microtubular cytoskeleton regulation and in the formation of aggregates found in some neurodegenerative diseases. Recently it has been shown that zinc is able to induce tau aggregation by interacting with several binding sites. However, the precise location of these sites and the molecular mechanism of zinc-induced aggregation remain unknown. Here we used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to identify zinc binding sites on hTau40 isoform. These experiments revealed three distinct zinc binding sites on tau, located in the N-terminal part (H14, H32, H94, and H121), the repeat region (H299, C322, H329 and H330) and the C-terminal part (H362, H374, H388 and H407). Further analysis enabled us to show that the C-terminal and the N-terminal sites are independent of each other. Using molecular simulations, we modeled the structure of each site in a complex with zinc. Given the clinical importance of zinc in tau aggregation, our findings pave the way for designing potential therapies for tauopathies.\n\nHighlightsO_LIZinc is known to induce tau aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases\nC_LIO_LIZinc binding locations and mechanism are not yet clear\nC_LIO_LIUsing NMR we localized 3 zinc binding site on tau\nC_LIO_LIBy molecular simulations, we proposed a modeled structure of each site\nC_LIO_LIOur findings pave the way for designing potential therapies for tauopathies\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Acute ischemic stroke damages regional brain blood vessel (BV) network. Urgent recovery of basic blood flows, which represents the earliest regenerated BVs, are critical to improve clinical outcomes and minimize lethality. Although the late-regenerated BVs have been implicated to form via growing along the meninge-derived lymphatic vessels (iLVs), mechanisms underlying the early, urgent BV regeneration remain elusive. Using zebrafish cerebrovascular injury models, we show that the earliest regenerated BVs come from lymphatic transdifferentiation, a hitherto unappreciated process in vertebrates. Mechanistically, LV-to-BV transdifferentiation occurs exclusively in the stand-alone iLVs through Notch activation. In the track iLVs adhered by nascent BVs, transdifferentiation never occurs because the BV-expressing EphrineB2a paracellularly activates the iLV-expressing EphB4a to inhibit Notch activation. Suppression of LV-to-BV transdifferentiation blocks early BV regeneration and becomes lethal. These results demonstrate that urgent BV regeneration occurs via lymphatic transdifferentiation, suggesting this process and key regulatory molecules EphrinB2a/EphB4a/Notch as new post-ischemic therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Interaction networks are a widely used tool to understand the dynamics of plant-pollinator ecological communities. However, while most mutualistic networks have been defined at the species level, ecological processes such as pollination take place at different scales, including the individual or patch levels. Yet, current approaches studying fine-grain sub-specific plant-pollinator networks only account for interactions among nodes belonging to a single plant species due to the conceptual and mathematical limitations of modeling simultaneously several plant species each composed of several nodes. Here, we introduce a multilayer diffusion network framework that allows modeling simple diffusion processes between nodes pertaining to the same or different layers (i.e. species). It is designed to depict from the network structure the potential conspecific and heterospecific pollen flows among plant individuals or patches. This potential pollen flow is modeled as a transport-like system, in which pollen grain movements are represented as random-walkers that diffuse on an ensemble of bipartite layers of conspecific plants and their shared pollinators. We exemplify this physical conceptualization using a dataset of nine fine-grain sub-specific plant-pollinator networks from a Mediterranean grassland of annual plants, where plant nodes represent groups of conspecifics within patches of 1 m2. The diffusion networks show pollinators effectively connecting sets of patches of the same and different plant species, forming a modular structure. Interestingly, different properties of the network structure, such as the conspecific pollen arrival probability and the number of conspecific subgraphs in which plants are embedded, are critical for the seed production of different plant species. We provide a simple but robust set of metrics to calculate potential pollen flow and scale down network ecology to functioning properties at the individual or patch level, where most ecological processes take place, hence moving forward the description and interpretation of species-rich communities across scales.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) play a pivotal role in shaping diversity in eukaryotic genomes. The covered smut pathogen on barley, Ustilago hordei, encountered a recent genome expansion. Using long reads, we assembled genomes of 6 U. hordei strains and 3 sister species, to study this genome expansion. We found that larger genome sizes can mainly be attributed to a higher genome fraction of long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs). In the studied smut genomes, LTR-RTs fractions are the largest in U. hordei and are positively correlated to the mating-type locus sizes, which is up to [~]560 kb in U. hordei. Furthermore, LTR-RTs were found to be associated with higher nucleotide substitution levels, as these higher levels occur more clustered in smut species with a recent LTR-RT proliferation. Moreover, genes in genome regions with higher nucleotide substitution levels generally reside closer to LTR-RTs than other genome regions. Genome regions with many nucleotide substitutions encountered an especially high fraction of CG substitutions, which is not observed for LTR-RT sequences. The high nucleotide substitution levels particularly accelerate the evolution of secretome genes, as their more flexible nature results that substitutions often lead to amino acid alterations.\n\nImportanceGenomic alteration can be generated through various means, in which transposable elements (TEs) can play a pivotal role. Their mobility causes mutagenesis in itself and can disrupt the function of the sequences they insert into. Indirectly, they also impact genome evolution as their repetitive nature facilitates non-homologous recombination. Furthermore, TEs have been linked to specific epigenetic genome organizations. We report a recent TE proliferation in the genome of the barley covered smut fungus, Ustilago hordei. This proliferation is associated with a distinct nucleotide substitution regime that has a higher rate and a higher fraction of CG substitutions. This different regime shapes the evolution of genes in subjected genome regions. Our findings highlight that TEs may influence the error-rate of DNA polymerase in a hitherto unknown fashion.",

    "abstract": "Fusion transcription factors generated by genomic translocations are common drivers of several types of cancers including sarcomas and leukemias. Oncofusions of the FET (FUS, EWSR1, and TAF15) family of proteins result from fusion of the prion-like domain (PLD) of FET proteins to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of certain transcription regulators and are implicated in aberrant transcriptional programs through interactions with chromatin remodelers. Here, we show that FUS-DDIT3, a FET oncofusion protein, undergoes PLD-mediated phase separation into liquid-like condensates. Nuclear FUS-DDIT3 condensates can recruit essential components of the global transcriptional machinery such as the chromatin remodeler SWI/SNF. The recruitment of mammalian SWI/SNF is driven by heterotypic PLD-PLD interactions between FUS-DDIT3 and core subunits of SWI/SNF, such as the catalytic component BRG1. Further experiments with single-molecule correlative force-fluorescence microscopy support a model wherein the fusion protein forms condensates on DNA surface and enrich BRG1 to activate transcription by ectopic chromatin remodeling. Similar PLD-driven co-condensation of mSWI/SNF with transcription factors can be employed by other oncogenic fusion proteins with a generic PLD-DBD domain architecture for global transcriptional reprogramming.",

Using a porcine kidney transplant model, we aimed to decipher the subclinical molecular effects of a RIC regime, compared to non-RIC controls.\n\nMethodsKidney pairs (n = 8+8) were extracted from brain dead donor pigs and transplanted in juvenile recipient pigs following a period of cold ischemia. One of the two kidney recipients in each pair was subjected to RIC prior to kidney graft reperfusion, while the other served as non-RIC control. We designed a modern integrative Omics strategy combining transcriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics to deduce molecular signatures in kidney tissue that could be attributed to RIC.\n\nResultsIn kidney grafts taken out 10 h after transplantation we detected minimal molecular perturbations following RIC compared to non-RIC at the transcriptome level, which was mirrored at the proteome level. In particular, we noted that RIC resulted in suppression of tissue inflammatory profiles. Furthermore, an accumulation of muscle extracellular matrix assembly proteins in kidney tissues was detected at the protein level, which may be in response to muscle tissue damage and/or fibrosis. However, the majority of these protein changes did not reach significance (p<0.05).\n\nConclusionsOur data identifies subtle molecular phenotypes in porcine kidneys following RIC and this knowledge could potentially aid optimization of remote ischemic conditioning protocols in renal transplantation.",

However, this approach has yet to scale and may be infeasible in many cases, highlighting the need for interventions that could benefit more patients. Here, we found that microglial phagocytosis is upregulated during cone degeneration in RP, suggesting that expression of \"dont eat me\" signals such as CD47 might confer protection to cones. To test this, we delivered an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector expressing CD47 on cones, which promoted cone survival in three mouse models of RP and preserved visual function. Cone rescue with CD47 required signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP) but not microglia or thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), suggesting that CD47 interacts with SIRP on non-microglial cells to alleviate degeneration. These findings establish augmentation of CD47-SIRP signaling as a potential treatment strategy for RP and possibly other forms of neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) relies on the coupling between neuronal and vascular activity, but the mechanisms behind this coupling are still under discussion. Recent experimental evidence suggests that calcium signaling may play a significant role in neurovascular coupling. However, it is still controversial where this calcium signal is located (in neurons or elsewhere), how it operates and how relevant is its role. In this paper we introduce a biologically plausible model of the neurovascular coupling and we show that calcium signaling in astrocytes can explain the main aspects of the dynamics of the coupling. We find that calcium signaling can explain so-far unrelated features such as the linear and non-linear regimes, the negative vascular response (undershoot) and the emergence of a (calcium-driven) Hemodynamic Response Function. These features are reproduced here for the first time by a single model of the detailed neuronal-astrocyte-vascular pathway. Furthermore, we analyze how information is coded and transmitted from the neuronal to the vascular system and we find that frequency modulation of astrocytic calcium dynamics plays a key role in this process. Finally, our work provides a framework to link neuronal activity to the BOLD signal, and vice-versa, where neuronal activity can be inferred from the BOLD signal. This opens new ways to link known alterations of astrocytic calcium signaling in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases) with detectable changes in neurovascular coupling.",

Viral cell entry requires spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor and spike cleavage by TMPRSS2, a cell surface serine protease. Targeting of TMPRSS2 by either androgen blockade or direct inhibition is already in clinical trials in early SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nMethodsThe likely initial cells of SARS-CoV-2 entry are the ciliated cells of the upper airway. We therefore used differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells maintained at the air-liquid interface (ALI) to test the impact of targeting TMPRSS2 on the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nResultsWe first modelled the systemic delivery of compounds. Enzalutamide, an oral androgen receptor antagonist, had no impact on SARS-Cov-2 infection. By contrast, camostat mesylate, an orally available serine protease inhibitor, blocked SARS-CoV-2 entry. However, camostat is rapidly metabolised in the circulation in vivo, and systemic bioavailability after oral dosing is low. We therefore modelled local airway administration by applying camostat to the apical surface of the differentiated ALI cultures. We demonstrated that a brief exposure to topical camostat is effective at restricting SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.\n\nConclusionThese experiments demonstrate a potential therapeutic role for topical camostat for pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2, which can now be evaluated in a clinical trial.",

    "abstract": "Branches are critical for neuron function, generating the morphological complexity required for functional networks. They emerge from different, well-described, cytoskeletal precursor structures that elongate to branches. While branches are thought to be maintained by shared cytoskeletal regulators, our data from mouse hippocampal neurons indicate that the precursor structures trigger alternative branch maintenance mechanisms with differing stabilities. While branches originating from lamellipodia or growth cone splitting events collapse soon after formation, branches emerging from filopodia persist. Furthermore, compared to other developing neurites, axons stabilise all branches and preferentially initiate branches from filopodia. These differences explain the decreased stability of branches we observe in neurons lacking the plasma membrane protein phospholipid phosphatase related protein 3 (PLPPR3/PRG2). Rather than altering branch stability directly, PLPPR3 boosts a  filopodia branch program on axons, thereby indirectly initiating more long-lived branches. We propose that studies on branching should distinguish overall stabilising effects from effects on precursor types, ideally using multifactorial statistical models as exemplified in this study.",

    "abstract": "Amphibians are animal that requires combinations of hydrosphere (riparian vegetation, water body) and vegetation (trees) microhabitats. In urban settings, those microhabitats are scarce and disappearing. One of areas that still have sufficient microhabitats to support amphibian populations is located in an 88.9 Ha urban forests of Universitas Indonesia Campus in West Java. Here, this paper aims to assess and model the several amphibian species occupancy ({Psi}) with vegetation covers, riparian vegetation, and water bodies based on Akaike habitat selection (AIC) indices. The studied amphibian species include Bufo melanosticus, Hylarana nicobariensis, Fejervarya limnocharis, and Polypedates leucomystax. For modeling, 7 microhabitat models were developed and tested for amphibian species occupancy with covariates including vegetation cover, riparian vegetation, and water body microhabitats. The Principle Component Analysis (PCA) shows that the occupancies of amphibian were influenced mostly by the presences of water bodies followed by riparian vegetation, and vegetation covers. According to the values of {Psi} and AIC, Polypedates leucomystax and Fejervarya limnocharis were species that have high occupancy in riparian vegetation microhabitats with {Psi} values of -14.18 and -12.59. Likewise, Hylarana nicobariensis has an equal occupancy in vegetation, riparian vegetation, and water body microhabitats. While Bufo melanosticus shows high occupancy in vegetated microhabitats ({Psi} = -14.18) rather than in riparian vegetation and water bodies ({Psi} = -8.79). The combinations of riparian vegetation and water bodies show higher occupancy ({Psi} = -8.00) rather than {Psi}(vegetation cover+water body = -5.64) and {Psi}(vegetation cover+ riparian vegetation = -4.36) combinations.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 can cause a range of symptoms in infected individuals, from mild respiratory illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome. A systematic understanding of the host factors mediating viral infection or restriction is critical to elucidate SARS-CoV-2 host-pathogen interactions and the progression of COVID-19. To this end, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR knockout and activation screens in human lung epithelial cells with endogenous expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2. These screens uncovered proviral and antiviral host factors across highly interconnected host pathways, including components implicated in clathrin transport, inflammatory signaling, cell cycle regulation, and transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. We further identified mucins, a family of high-molecular weight glycoproteins, as a prominent viral restriction network. We demonstrate that multiple membrane-anchored mucins are critical inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 entry and are upregulated in response to viral infection. This functional landscape of SARS-CoV-2 host factors provides a physiologically relevant starting point for new host-directed therapeutics and suggests interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and airway mucins of COVID-19 patients as a host defense mechanism.",

    "abstract": "A new coronavirus pandemic COVID-19, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), poses a serious threat across continents, leading the World Health Organization to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. In order to block the entry of the virus into human host cells, major therapeutic and vaccine design efforts are now targeting the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and the human cellular membrane receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme, hACE2. By analyzing cryo-EM structures of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, we report here that the homotrimer SARS-CoV-2 S receptor-binding domain (RBD) that binds with hACE2 has expanded in size, undergoing a large conformational change relative to SARS-CoV-1 S protein. Protomer with the up-conformational form of RBD, which binds with hACE2, exhibits higher intermolecular interactions at the RBD-ACE2 interface, with differential distributions and the inclusion of specific H-bonds in the CoV-2 complex. Further interface analysis has shown that interfacial water promotes and stabilizes the formation of CoV-2/hACE2 complex. This interaction has caused a significant structural rigidification, favoring proteolytic processing of S protein for the fusion of the viral and cellular membrane. Moreover, conformational dynamics simulations of RBD motions in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 point to the role in modification in the RBD dynamics and their likely impact on infectivity.",

    "abstract": "Helical growth broadly exists in immobile plants to support their limited movement, and Arabidopsis seedling root exhibiting natural left-handedness helical growth is considered as a simplified model for investigating this interesting behavior. Efforts have been made for understanding the mechanism of root helical growth and consequent root waving and skewing on tilted and impenetrable surface, and several models have been established. Here, previous reports are reviewed and a straightforward torsions-driven mechanism has been emphasized, and additional experiments have been performed to fill up the gaps of this theory in our study.\n\nThis study implies that, torsions originating from handedness of both cortical microtubules and cellulose microfibrils play central role in root handed helical growth. Different from torsions directly provided by handed assembled cortical microtubules, torsions originating from right-handed assembled cellulose microfibrils are relaxed by their cross-linking with pectin within cell wall, but only exhibited when their cross-linking is interrupted due to damaged cell wall integrity. To topologically relax these torsions, supercoils of cortical microtubules and/or cellulose microfibrils exhibiting as oblique alignments are formed in root cells, which alter the orientation of root cell files and generate handed helical roots. Working together with gravitropic response, relaxation of torsions originating from helical roots drives roots to elongate with handedness, which therefore produces waved and skewed roots on tilted and impenetrable surface.",

    "abstract": "While beta-band activity during motor planning is known to be modulated by uncertainty about where to act, less is known about its modulations to uncertainty about how to act. To investigate this issue, we recorded oscillatory brain activity with EEG while human participants (n = 17) performed a hand choice reaching task. The reaching hand was either predetermined or of participants choice, and the target was close to one of the two hands or at about equal distance from both. To measure neural activity in a motion-artifact-free time window, the location of the upcoming target was cued 1000-1500 ms before the presentation of the target, whereby the cue was valid in 50% of trials. As evidence for motor planning during the cueing phase, behavioral observations showed that the cue affected later hand choice. Furthermore, reaction times were longer in the choice than in the predetermined trials, supporting the notion of a competitive process for hand selection. Modulations of beta-band power over central cortical regions, but not alpha-band or theta-band power, were in line with these observations. During the cueing period, reaches in predetermined trials were preceded by larger decreases in beta-band power than reaches in choice trials. Cue direction did not affect reaction times or beta-band power, which may be due to the cue being invalid in 50% of trials, retaining effector uncertainty during motor planning. Our findings suggest that effector uncertainty, similar to target uncertainty, selectively modulates beta-band power during motor planning.\n\nNew & NoteworthyWhile reach-related beta-band power in central cortical areas is known to modulate with the number of potential targets, here we show, using a cueing paradigm, that the power in this frequency band, but not in the alpha or theta-band, is also modulated by the uncertainty of which hand to use. This finding supports the notion that multiple possible effector-specific actions can be specified in parallel up to the level of motor preparation.",

Here, we test the hypothesis that ERK signaling is a mediator of Wnt-dependent cell fate decisions in the cranial mesenchyme. First, we show that loss of Erk1/2 in the cranial mesenchyme results in a diminished domain of osteoblast marker expression and increased expression of cartilage fate markers and ectopic cartilage formation in the frontal bone primordia. Second, we show that mesenchyme Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling and Wntless are required for ERK activation in calvarial osteoblasts. Third, we demonstrate that Wnt and ERK signaling pathways function together to repress Sox9 expression in mouse cranial mesenchyme. Our results demonstrate a link between the Wnt and ERK signaling pathways in regulating lineage selection in a subset of calvarial cells and provide new insights into Wnt-dependent cell fate decisions.",

    "abstract": "Risk factors for COVID-19 disease severity are still poorly understood. Considering the pivotal role of gut microbiota on host immune and inflammatory functions, we investigated the association between changes in gut microbiota composition and the clinical severity of COVID-19. We conducted a multicentre cross-sectional study prospectively enrolling 115 COVID-19 patients categorized according to: 1) WHO Clinical Progression Scale - mild 19 (16.5%), moderate 37 (32.2%) or severe 59 (51.3%); and 2) location of recovery from COVID-19 - ambulatory 14 (household isolation; 12.2%), hospitalized in ward 40 (34.8%) or intensive care unit 61 (53.0%). Gut microbiota analysis was performed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and data obtained was further related with clinical parameters of COVID-19 patients. Risk factors for COVID-19 severity were identified by univariate and multivariable logistic regression models.\n\nIn comparison with mild COVID-19 patients, the gut microbiota of moderate and severe patients has: a) lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, b) higher abundance of Proteobacteria; and c) lower abundance of beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria such as Roseburia and Lachnospira genera. Multivariable regression analysis showed that Shannon index diversity (odds ratio [OR] 2.85 [95% CI 1.09-7.41]; p=0.032) and C-Reactive Protein (OR 3.45 [95% CI 1.33-8.91]; p=0.011) were risk factors for COVID-19 severe disease (a score of 6 or higher in WHO clinical progression scale).\n\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrated that hospitalised moderate and severe COVID-19 patients have microbial signatures of gut dysbiosis and for the first time, the gut microbiota diversity is pointed out as a prognostic biomarker for COVID-19 disease severity.",

    "abstract": "Remarkable infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is due to the rapid emergence of various strains, thus enable the virus to rule the world. Over the course of SARS-CoV2 pandemic, the scientific communities worldwide are responding to newly emerging genetic variants. However, the mechanism behind the persistent infection of these variants is still not known due to the paucity of study of these variants at molecular level. In this scenario, computational methods have immense utility in understanding the molecular and functional properties of different variants. Therefore, in this study various mutants (MTs) of SpikeS1 receptor binding domain (RBD) of highly infectious SARS-CoV2 strains were carried and elucidated the protein structure and dynamics using molecular dynamics (MD) approach. MD simulation study showed that all MTs exhibited stable structures with altered functional properties. Furthermore, the binding strength of different MTs along with WT (wildtype) was revealed through protein-protein docking and observed that MTs showed high binding affinities than WT. Hence, this study shed light on the molecular basis of infection caused by different variants of SARS-CoV2, which might play an important role in to cease the transmission and pathogenesis of virus and also implicate in rational designing of a specific drug.",

Previous molecular phylogenetic investigations of the Tussilaginineae have included few, if any, representatives of this Gynoxoid group or reconstructed ambiguous patterns of relationships for it.\n\nMETHODSWe sequenced complete plastid genomes of 21 species of the Gynoxoid group and related Tussilaginineae and conducted detailed comparisons of the phylogenetic relationships supported by the gene, intron, and intergenic spacer partitions of these genomes. We also evaluated the impact of manual, motif-based adjustments of automatic DNA sequence alignments on phylogenetic tree inference.\n\nRESULTSOur results indicate that the inclusion of all plastid genome partitions is needed to infer fully resolved phylogenetic trees of the Gynoxoid group. Whole plastome-based tree inference suggests that the genera Gynoxys and Nordenstamia are polyphyletic and form the core clade of the Gynoxoid group. This clade is sister to a clade of Aequatorium and Paragynoxys and also includes some but not all representatives of Paracalia.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThe concatenation and combined analysis of all plastid genome partitions and the construction of manually curated, motif-based DNA sequence alignments are found to be instrumental in the recovery of strongly supported relationships of the Gynoxoid group. We demonstrate that the correct assessment of homology in genome-level plastid sequence datasets is crucial for subsequent phylogeny reconstruction and that the manual post-processing of multiple sequence alignments improves the reliability of such reconstructions amid low genetic distances between taxa.",

From patient transcriptomic data, we have discovered a circulating miRNA, miR-2392, that is directly involved with SARS-CoV-2 machinery during host infection. Specifically, we show that miR-2392 is key in driving downstream suppression of mitochondrial gene expression, increasing inflammation, glycolysis, and hypoxia as well as promoting many symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection. We demonstrate miR-2392 is present in the blood and urine of COVID-19 positive patients, but not detected in COVID-19 negative patients. These findings indicate the potential for developing a novel, minimally invasive, COVID-19 detection method. Lastly, using in vitro human and in vivo hamster models, we have developed a novel miRNA-based antiviral therapeutic that targets miR-2392, significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 viability in hamsters and may potentially inhibit a COVID-19 disease state in humans.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is marked by deficits in facial affect processing associated with abnormalities in GABAergic circuitry, deficits also found in first-degree relatives. Facial affect processing involves a distributed network of brain regions including limbic regions like amygdala and visual processing areas like fusiform cortex. Pharmacological modulation of GABAergic circuitry using benzodiazepines like alprazolam can be useful for studying this facial affect processing network and associated GABAergic abnormalities in schizophrenia. Here, we use pharmacological modulation and computational modeling to study the contribution of GABAergic abnormalities toward emotion processing deficits in schizophrenia. Specifically, we apply principles from network control theory to model persistence energy - the control energy required to maintain brain activation states - during emotion identification and recall tasks, with and without administration of alprazolam, in a sample of first-degree relatives and healthy controls. Here, persistence energy quantifies the magnitude of theoretical external inputs during the task. We find that alprazolam increases persistence energy in relatives but not in controls during threatening face processing, suggesting a compensatory mechanism given the relative absence of behavioral abnormalities in this sample of unaffected relatives. Further, we demonstrate that regions in the fusiform and occipital cortices are important for facilitating state transitions during facial affect processing. Finally, we uncover spatial relationships (i) between regional variation in differential control energy (alprazolam versus placebo) and (ii) both serotonin and dopamine neurotransmitter systems, indicating that alprazolam may exert its effects by altering neuromodulatory systems. Together, these findings reveal differences in emotion-processing circuitry associated with genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia.",

Of the many vaccines that are being developed against COVID-19, inactivated whole-virus vaccines are also considered effective. {beta}-propiolactone (BPL) is a widely used chemical inactivator of several viruses. Here, we analyze various concentrations of BPL to effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and their effects on the biochemical properties of the virion particles. BPL at 1:2000 (v/v) concentrations effectively inactivated SARS-CoV-2. However, higher BPL concentrations resulted in the loss of both protein content as well as the antigenic integrity of the structural proteins. Higher concentrations also caused substantial aggregation of the virion particles possibly causing undesirable outcomes including a potential immune escape by infectious virions, and a loss in antigenic potential. We also identify that the viral RNA content in the culture supernatants can be a direct indicator of their antigenic content. Our findings may have important implications in the vaccine and antisera industry during COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRetrotransposons are genetic elements inducing mutations in all domains of life. Despite their detrimental effect, retrotransposons become temporarily active during epigenetic reprogramming and cellular stress response, which may accelerate host genome evolution. In fungal pathogens, a positive role has been attributed to retrotransposons when shaping genome architecture and expression of genes encoding pathogenicity factors; thus, retrotransposons are known to influence pathogenicity.\n\nResultsWe here uncovered a hitherto unknown role of fungal retrotransposons as being pathogenicity factors, themselves. Studying the aggressive fungal plant pathogen Botrytis cinerea, that is known to deliver some long-terminal repeat (LTR) deriving regulatory trans-species small RNAs (BcsRNAs) into plant cells to suppress host gene expression for infection we found that naturally occurring, less aggressive B. cinerea strains possess considerably lower copy numbers of LTR retrotransposons and had lost retrotransposon BcsRNA production. By a transgenic proof-of-concept approach, we reconstituted retrotransposon expression in a BcsRNA-lacking B. cinerea strain, which resulted in enhanced aggressiveness in a retrotransposon and BcsRNA expression-dependent manner. Moreover, retrotransposon expression in B. cinerea led to suppression of plant defence-related genes during infection.\n\nConclusionsWe propose that retrotransposons are pathogenicity factors that manipulate host plant gene expression by encoding trans-species BcsRNAs. Taken together, the novelty that retrotransposons are pathogenicity factors will have general impact on studies of host-microbe interactions and pathology.",

    "abstract": "During continuous perception of movies or stories, awake humans display cortical activity patterns that reveal hierarchical segmentation of event structure. Sensory areas like auditory cortex display high frequency segmentation related to the stimulus, while semantic areas like posterior middle cortex display a lower frequency segmentation related to transitions between events (Baldassano et al. 2017). These hierarchical levels of segmentation are associated with different time constants for processing. Chien and Honey (2020) observed that when two groups of participants heard the same sentence in a narrative, preceded by different contexts, neural responses for the groups were initially different and then gradually aligned. The time constant for alignment followed the segmentation hierarchy: sensory cortices aligned most quickly, followed by mid-level regions, while some higher-order cortical regions took more than 10 seconds to align. These hierarchical segmentation phenomena can be considered in the context of processing related to comprehension. Uchida et al. (2021) recently described a model of discourse comprehension where word meanings are modeled by a language model pre-trained on a billion word corpus (Yamada et al 2020). During discourse comprehension, word meanings are continuously integrated in a recurrent cortical network. The model demonstrates novel discourse and inference processing, in part because of two fundamental characteristics: real-world event semantics are represented in the word embeddings, and these are integrated in a reservoir network which has an inherent gradient of functional time constants due to the recurrent connections. Here we demonstrate how this model displays hierarchical narrative event segmentation properties. The reservoir produces activation patterns that are segmented by the HMM of Baldassano et al (2017) in a manner that is comparable to that of humans. Context construction displays a continuum of time constants across reservoir neuron subset, while context forgetting has a fixed time constant across these subsets. Virtual areas formed by subgroups of reservoir neurons with faster time constants segmented with shorter events, while those with longer time constants preferred longer events. This neurocomputational recurrent neural network simulates narrative event processing as revealed by the fMRI event segmentation algorithm of Baldassano et al (2017), and provides a novel explanation of the asymmetry in narrative forgetting and construction observed by Chien and Honey (2020). The model extends the characterization of online integration processes in discourse to more extended narrative, and demonstrates how reservoir computing provides a useful model of cortical processing of narrative structure.",

    "abstract": "We propose here (the informed use) of a customised, data-driven machine-learning pipeline to analyse magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a theoretical source space, with respect to the processing of a regular beat. This hypothesis- and data-driven analysis pipeline allows us to extract the maximally relevant components in MEG source-space, with respect to the oscillatory power in the frequency band of interest and, most importantly, the beat-related modulation of that power. Our pipeline combines Spatio-Spectral Decomposition as a first step to seek activity in the frequency band of interest (SSD, [1]) with a Source Power Co-modulation analysis (SPoC; [2]), which extracts those components that maximally entrain their activity with the given target function, that is here with the periodicity of the beat in the frequency domain (hence, f-SPoC). MEG data (102 magnetometers) from 28 participants passively listening to a 5-min long regular tone sequence with a 400 ms beat period (the \"target function\" for SPoC) were segmented into epochs of two beat periods each to guarantee a sufficiently long time window. As a comparison pipeline to SSD and f-SpoC, we carried out a state-of-the-art cluster-based permutation analysis (CBPA, [3]). The time-frequency analysis (TFA) of the extracted activity showed clear regular patterns of periodically occurring peaks and troughs across the alpha and beta band (8-20 Hz) in the f-SPoC but not in the CBPA results, and both the depth and the specificity of modulation to the beat frequency yielded a significant advantage. Future applications of this pipeline will address target the relevance to behaviour and inform analogous analyses in the EEG, in order to finally work toward addressing dysfunctions in beat-based timing and their consequences.\n\nAuthor summaryWhen listening to a regular beat, oscillations in the brain have been shown to synchronise with the frequency of that given beat. This phenomenon is called entrainment and has in previous brain-imaging studies been shown in the form of one peak and trough per beat cycle in a range of frequency bands within 15-25 Hz (beta band). Using machine-learning techniques, we designed an analysis pipeline based on Source-Power Co-Modulation (SPoC) that enables us to extract spatial components in MEG recordings that show these synchronisation effects very clearly especially across 8-20 Hz. This approach requires no anatomical knowledge of the individual or even the average brain, it is purely data driven and can be applied in a hypothesis-driven fashion with respect to the \"function\" that we expect the brain to entrain with and the frequency band within which we expect to see this entrainment. We here apply our customised pipeline using \"f-SPoC\" to MEG recordings from 28 participants passively listening to a 5-min long tone sequence with a regular 2.5 Hz beat. In comparison to a cluster-based permutation analysis (CBPA) which finds sensors that show statistically significant power modulations across participants, our individually extracted f-SPoC components find a much stronger and clearer pattern of peaks and troughs within one beat cycle. In future work, this pipeline can be implemented to tackle more complex \"target functions\" like speech and music, and might pave the way toward rhythm-based rehabilitation strategies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCoagulation disorders are common in patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), associated with an increased risk of bleeding and death. We aim to investigate coagulation disorders and their outcome implications in critically ill patients with HLH.\n\nMethodsWe prospectively evaluated 47 critically ill patients with HLH (median age of 54 years [42-67]) between April 2015 and December 2018. Coagulation assessments were performed at day 1. Abnormal standard coagulation was defined as prothrombin time (PT) <50% and/or fibrinogen <2g/L. HLH aetiology was mostly ascribed to haematological malignancies (74% of patients).\n\nResultsCoagulation disorders and severe bleeding events were frequent, occurring in 30 (64%) and 11 (23%) patients respectively. At day 1, median fibrinogen level was 2{middle dot}65g/L [1.61-5.66]. Fibrinolytic activity was high as suggested by increased median levels of D-dimers, fibrin monomers, PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor) and tPA (tissue plasminogen activator). Forty-one (91%) patients had a decreased ADAMTS13 activity (A Disintegrin-like And Metalloproteinase with ThromboSpondin type 1 repeats, member 13). By multivariable analysis, the occurrence of a severe bleeding (OR 3.215 [1.194-8.653], p=0{middle dot}021) and SOFA score (Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment) at day 1 (OR 1.305 per point [1.146-1.485], p<0{middle dot}001) were independently associated with hospital mortality. No early biological marker was associated with severe bleeding.\n\nConclusionsHyperfibrinolysis may be the primary mechanism responsible for hypofibrinogenemia and may also participate in ADAMTS13 degradation. Targeting the plasmin system appears as a promising approach in severe HLH-related coagulation disorders.",

    "abstract": "Queen conch are among the most economically, socially, and culturally important fishery resources in the Caribbean. Despite a multitude of fisheries management measures enacted across the region, populations are depleted and failing to recover. It is believed that queen conch are highly susceptible to depensatory processes, impacting reproductive success and contributing to the lack of recovery. We developed a model of reproductive dynamics to evaluate how variations in biological factors such as population density, movement speeds, movement restrictions, rest periods between mating events, sexual facilitation, and perception of conspecifics affect reproductive success and overall reproductive output. We compared simulation results to empirical observations of mating and spawning frequencies from conch populations in the central Bahamas and Florida Keys. Our results confirm that low probability of mate finding associated with decreased population density is the primary driver behind observed breeding behavior in the field, although additional factors also play important roles. In particular, sexual facilitation and perception of conspecifics may explain observed lack of mating at low densities and differences between mating frequencies in the central Bahamas and Florida Keys, respectively. Our simulations suggest densities greater than 200 adults/ha are needed for high levels of spawning output, supporting the suggestion that effective management strategies for queen conch should aim to protect high-density reproductive aggregations and critical breeding habitats.",

However, the majority of individuals who present with CS-like clinical features are found to be PTEN-mutation negative. Reassessment of PTEN promoter regulation may help explain abnormal PTEN dosage, as only the minimal promoter and coding regions are currently included in diagnostic PTEN mutation analysis. We reanalyzed the architecture of the PTEN promoter using next-generation sequencing datasets. Specifically, run-on sequencing assays identified two additional TSRs at -2052 and -1907 basepairs from the start of PTEN, thus redefining the PTEN promoter and extending the PTEN 5UTR. The upstream TSRs described are active in cancer cell lines and human cancer and normal tissue. Further, these TSRs can produce novel PTEN transcripts due to the introduction of new splice sites. Evaluation of transcription factor binding specific to the upstream TSRs shows overrepresentation of TFs involved in inflammatory processes. Together, these data suggest that potentially clinically relevant promoter variants upstream of the known promoter may be overlooked in indivduals considered PTEN germline mutation-negative and may also explain lack of PTEN expression in sporadic neoplasias without PTEN somatic structural defects.",

    "abstract": "Dravet syndrome (DS) is a developmental epileptic encephalopathy mainly caused by functional NaV1.1 haploinsufficiency in interneurons (IN). Recently, a new conditional mouse model expressing the recurrent human p.A1783V missense variant has become available. Here we provide an electrophysiological characterization of this variant in tsA201 cells, revealing both altered voltage-dependence of activation and slow inactivation without reduced sodium peak current density. Simulating IN excitability in a Hodgkin-Huxley one-compartment model suggested surprisingly similar firing deficits for Scn1aA1783V and full haploinsufficiency as caused by heterozygous truncation variants. Impaired NaVA1783V channel activation was predicted to have a significantly larger impact on channel function than altered slow inactivation and is therefore proposed as the main mechanism underlying IN dysfunction. The computational model was validated in cortical organotypic slice cultures derived from conditional Scn1aA1783V mice. Pan-neuronal activation of the p.A1783V variant in vitro confirmed the predicted IN firing deficit while demonstrating normal excitability of pyramidal neurons. Taken together these data demonstrate that despite maintained physiological peak currents density LOF gating properties may match effects of full haploinsufficiency on neuronal level, thereby causing DS.\n\nHighlightsNaV1.1A1783V alters voltage-dependence of activation and slow inactivation while not affecting fast inactivation.\nDepolarizing and hyperpolarizing shifts of activation and slow inactivation curves result in combined channel loss of function (LOF).\nSimulations of NaV1.1A1783V interneuronal properties indicate reduced action potential firing rates comparable to full SCN1A haploinsufficiency, which is often found in Dravet syndrome.\nIn silico modelling identifies impaired channel activation as the predominant mechanism of channel LOF.\nPanneuronal induction of Scn1a+/A1783V in a cortical slice culture model confirms restriction of loss of function and its restriction to interneurons.",

When activated by chemokine CCL3, AS promote a robust DAergic neuroprotection both in cellular and pre-clinical models of PD, with mechanisms not fully elucidated. Here we used a combination of techniques to characterize AS-EVs derived from VMB and STR, and investigated their potential to exert neuroprotection. First, we show that: (i) AS of both regions secrete small EVs of ~100 nm; (ii) VMB-AS release more EVs per cell than STR-AS under basal conditions; and (iii) only VMB-AS respond to CCL3 by producing more EVs, suggesting differential AS-EV secretion rate according to PD brain region. Next, addressing AS-EV potential against oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicity, we found that AS-EVs, especially CCL3-AS-EVs, fully counteract H2O2-induced caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, using high resolution respirometry, we demonstrated that AS-EVs rescue the neuronal mitochondrial complex I function impaired by MPP+, with VMB-AS-EVs fully restoring ATP production in MPP+-injured neurons, highlighting a regional diversity of AS-EVs with neuroprotective implications for PD.",

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate a single-group summary for sero-prevalence of PPR disease in small ruminants of Ethiopia and assess the potential risk factor to contribute the sero-prevalence estimate.\n\nMethodologyArticle on PPR in sheep and goats were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, reference lists and African online source of articles that had been conducted between 1994 to 2020 and using inclusion and exclusion criteria with restricted to those studies published in English language.\n\nResultsA total of 13 published papers containing 46 district level studies were included for analyses. The single-group summary of PPR disease sero-prevalence in small ruminant was estimated to be 27.71% (95 % CI: 21.46 - 33.96). Overall, the estimated pooled sero-prevalence at country level in sheep was 33.56% (95% CI: 18.72-48.41) and in goats 25.14% (95% CI: 15.68-34.59). Significant heterogeneity (I2 > 80%) was noted in all pooled estimates. The visual inspection of the funnel plot demonstrated the presence of possible publication bias which could be associated with the small number of studies and longtime interval.\n\nConclusionsThis quantitative review showed that the pooled sero-prevalence to be high and regional prevalence estimates of PPR presented here will be useful in raising awareness and advocating the Governments to engage in initiatives PPR control and prevention.",

The obtained DNA was further used for 16S rRNA PCR optimization. Finally, an optimized protocol is proposed for the molecular analysis of cyanobacteria group in freshwater samples. The best DNA extraction method was the potassium xanthogenate extraction from dried cyanobacterial biomass. A dynamic in total genomic eDNA was observed, reflecting the seasonal difference in phytoplankton biomass from the studied lakes. The PCR protocol optimized by us can be successfully applied for the identification of a broad range of cyanobacterial genetic markers.",
