    "abstract": "Movement-related decreases in firing rate have been observed in basal ganglia output neurons. They may transmit motor signals to the thalamus, but the effect of these firing rate decreases on downstream neurons in the motor thalamus is not known. One possibility is that they lead to thalamic post-inhibitory rebound spikes. However, it has also been argued that the physiological conditions permitting rebound spiking are pathological, and primarily present in Parkinsons disease. As in Parkinsons disease neural activity becomes pathologically correlated, we investigated the impact of correlations in basal ganglia output on the transmission of motor signals using a Hodgkin-Huxley model of thalamocortical neurons. We found that such correlations disrupt the transmission of motor signals via rebound spikes by decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio and increasing the trial-to-trial variability. We further examined the role of sensory responses in basal ganglia output neurons and the effect of cortical excitation of motor thalamus in modulating rebound spiking. Interestingly, both could either promote or suppress the generation of rebound spikes depending on their timing relative to the motor signal. Finally, we determined parameter regimes, such as levels of excitation, under which rebound spiking is feasible in the model, and confirmed that the conditions for rebound spiking are primarily given in pathological regimes. However, we also identified specific conditions in the model that would allow rebound spiking to occur in healthy animals in a small subset of thalamic neurons. Overall, our model provides novel insights into differences between normal and pathological transmission of motor signals.",

    "abstract": "24-hour, circadian rhythms control many eukaryotic mRNA levels, whereas the levels of their more stable proteins are not expected to reflect the RNA rhythms, emphasizing the need to test the circadian regulation of protein abundance and modification. Here we present circadian proteomic and phosphoproteomic time-series from Arabidopsis thaliana plants under constant light conditions, estimating that just 0.4% of quantified proteins but a much larger proportion of quantified phospho-sites were rhythmic. Approximately half of the rhythmic phospho-sites were most phosphorylated at subjective dawn, a pattern we term the  phospho-dawn. Members of the SnRK/CDPK family of protein kinases are candidate regulators. A CCA1-over-expressing line that disables the clock gene circuit lacked most circadian protein phosphorylation. However, the few phospho-sites that fluctuated despite CCA1-over-expression still tended to peak in abundance close to subjective dawn, suggesting that the canonical clock mechanism is necessary for most but perhaps not all protein phosphorylation rhythms. To test the potential functional relevance of our datasets, we conducted phosphomimetic experiments using the bifunctional enzyme fructose-6-phosphate-2-kinase / phosphatase (F2KP), as an example. The rhythmic phosphorylation of diverse protein targets is controlled by the clock gene circuit, implicating post-translational mechanisms in the transmission of circadian timing information in plants.",

    "abstract": "Privacy concerns for rare disease data, institutional or IRB policies, access to local computational or storage resources or download capabilities are among the reasons that may preclude analyses that pool data to a single site. A growing number of multi-site projects and consortia were formed to function in the federated environment to conduct productive research under constraints of this kind. In this scenario, a quality control tool that visualizes decentralized data in its entirety via global aggregation of local computations is especially important, as it would allow the screening of samples that cannot be jointly evaluated otherwise. To solve this issue, we present two algorithms: decentralized data stochastic neighbor embedding, dSNE, and its differentially private counterpart, DP-dSNE. We leverage publicly available datasets to simultaneously map data samples located at different sites according to their similarities. Even though the data never leaves the individual sites, dSNE does not provide any formal privacy guarantees. To overcome that, we rely on differential privacy: a formal mathematical guarantee that protects individuals from being identified as contributors to a dataset. We implement DP-dSNE with AdaCliP, a method recently proposed to add less noise to the gradients per iteration. We introduce metrics for measuring the embedding quality and validate our algorithms on these metrics against their centralized counterpart on two toy datasets. Our validation on six multi-site neuroimaging datasets shows promising results for the quality control tasks of visualization and outlier detection, highlighting the potential of our private, decentralized visualization approach.",

    "abstract": "More ambitious conservation efforts are needed to stop the global biodiversity crisis. Here, we estimate the minimum land area to secure important sites for terrestrial fauna, ecologically intact areas, and the optimal locations for representation of species ranges and ecoregions. We discover that at least 64 million km2 (44% of terrestrial area) requires conservation attention. Over 1.8 billion people live on these lands so responses that promote agency, self-determination, equity, and sustainable management for safeguarding biodiversity are essential. Spatially explicit land-use scenarios suggest that 1.3 million km2 of land requiring conservation could be lost to intensive human land-uses by 2030, which requires immediate attention. However, there is a seven-fold difference between the amount of habitat converted under optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, highlighting an opportunity to avert this crisis. Appropriate targets in the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework to ensure conservation of the identified land would contribute substantially to safeguarding biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Organisms continuously modify their living conditions via extended genetic effects on their envi-ronment, microbiome, and in some species culture. These effects can impact the fitness of current but also future conspecifics due to non-genetic transmission via ecological or cultural inheritance. In this case, selection on a gene with extended effects depends on the degree to which current and future genetic relatives are exposed to modified conditions. Here, we detail the selection gradient on a quantitative trait with extended effects in a patch-structured population, when gene flow between patches is limited and ecological inheritance within patches can be biased towards offspring. Such a situation is relevant to understand evolutionary driven changes in individual condition that can be preferentially transmitted from parent to offspring, such as cellular state, micro-environments (e.g., nests), pathogens, microbiome, or culture. Our analysis quantifies how the interaction between limited gene flow and biased ecological inheritance influences the joint evolutionary dynamics of traits together with the conditions they modify, helping understand adaptation via non-genetic modifications. As an illustration, we apply our analysis to a gene-culture coevolution scenario in which genetically-determined learning strategies coevolve with adaptive knowledge. In particular, we show that when social learning is synergistic, selection can favour strategies that generate remarkable levels of knowledge under intermediate levels of both vertical cultural transmission and limited dispersal. More broadly, our theory yields insights into the interplay between genetic and non-genetic inheritance, with implications for how organisms evolve to transform their environments.",

    "abstract": "Trophic interactions may strongly depend on body size and environmental variation, but this prediction has been seldom tested in nature. Many spiders are generalist predators that use webs to intercept flying prey. The size and mesh of orb webs increases with spider size, allowing a more efficient predation on larger prey. We studied to this extent the orb-weaving spider Araneus diadematus inhabiting forest fragments differing in edge distance, tree diversity and tree species. These environmental variables are known to correlate to insect composition, richness and abundance. We anticipated these forest characteristics to be a principle driver of prey consumption. We additionally hypothesised them to impact spider size at maturity and expect shifts towards larger prey-size distributions in larger individuals independently from the environmental context.\n\nWe quantified spider diet by means of metabarcoding of nearly 1000 A. diadematus from a total of 53 forest plots. This approach allowed a massive screening of consumption dynamics in nature, though at the cost of identifying the exact prey identity, as well as their abundance and putative intraspecific variation. Our study confirmed A. diadematus as a generalist predator, with more than 300 prey ZOTUs detected in total. At the individual level, we found large spiders to consume fewer different species, but adding larger species to their diet. Tree species composition affected both prey species richness and size in the spiders diet, although tree diversity per se had no influence on the consumed prey. Edges had an indirect effect on the spider diet as spiders closer to the forest edge were larger and therefore consumed larger prey. We conclude that both intraspecific size variation and tree species composition shape the consumed prey of this generalist predator.",

We found support for this hypothesis by recording sleep-wake state alongside PER2 bioluminescence in freely behaving mice, demonstrating that PER2 increases during spontaneous waking and decreases during sleep. The temporary reinstatement of PER2 rhythmicity in behaviorally arrhythmic SCN-lesioned mice submitted to daily recurring sleep deprivations substantiates our hypothesis. Mathematical modelling revealed that PER2 dynamics can be described by a damped harmonic oscillator driven by two forces: a sleep-wake-dependent force and a SCN-independent circadian force. Our work underscores the notion that in peripheral tissues the clock gene circuitry integrates sleep-wake information and could thereby contribute to behavioral adaptability to respond to homeostatic requirements.",

    "abstract": "Liana dynamics may influence tree dynamics and vice versa. Only long-term studies can perhaps disentangle them. In two permanent plots of lowland dipterocarp forest at Danum a liana census in 1988 was repeated in 2018. The primary forest was still in a late stage of recovery from an inferred large and natural disturbance in the past. Mean number of lianas per tree decreased by 22 and 34% in plots 1 and 2, and in different ways. By 2018 there were relatively more trees with few lianas and relatively fewer trees with many lianas than in 1988. The redistribution was strongest for overstorey trees of the Dipterocarpaceae (more with no lianas by 2018) and understorey trees of the Euphorbiaceae (many losing high loads in especially plot 2). Proportion of trees with lianas increased overall by 3.5%. Number of lianas per tree showed a quadratic relationship with tree size: maximal for large trees, fewer for smaller and very large trees. Tree survival and stem growth rate were significantly negatively related to the number of lianas after accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Monte Carlo random subsampling of trees in 1988 and 2018, to achieve statistical independence, established significance of change. Dipterocarps and euphorbs clearly differed in their liana dynamics between plots. Regression models had different forms for the two plots, which reflected a complicated structural-spatial variability in host-liana dynamics. Analysis of the abundant tree species individually, highlighted a group of emergent dipterocarps with low liana counts decreasing with time. Building on an earlier hypothesis for this forest type and site, these very large trees appear to have been losing their lianas by branch shedding, as they moved into and out of the main canopy. They were evidently  escaping from the parasite. The process may in part explain the characteristically very uneven forest canopy at Danum. Change in liana density was therefore contingent on both forest history and site succession, and on plot-level structure and tree dynamics. Liana promotion in the intermittent ENSO dry periods was seemingly being offset by closing of the forest and dominance by dipterocarps in late seral stages.",

    "abstract": "The retinogeniculate visual pathway (RGVP) conveys visual information from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus. The RGVP has four subdivisions, including two decussating and two non-decussating pathways that cannot be identified on conventional structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Diffusion MRI tractography has the potential to trace these subdivisions and is increasingly used to study the RGVP. However, it is not yet known which fiber tracking strategy is most suitable for RGVP reconstruction. In this study, four tractography methods are compared, including constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) based probabilistic (iFOD1) and deterministic (SD-Stream) methods, and multi-fiber (UKF-2T) and single-fiber (UKF-1T) unscented Kalman filter (UKF) methods. Experiments use diffusion MRI data from 57 subjects in the Human Connectome Project. The RGVP is identified using regions of interest created by two clinical experts. Quantitative anatomical measurements and expert anatomical judgment are used to assess the advantages and limitations of the four tractography methods. Overall, we conclude that UKF-2T and iFOD1 produce the best RGVP reconstruction results. The iFOD1 method can better quantitatively estimate the percentage of decussating fibers, while the UKF-2T method produces reconstructed RGVPs that are judged to better correspond to the known anatomy and have the highest spatial overlap across subjects. Overall, we find that it is challenging for current tractography methods to both accurately track RGVP fibers that correspond to known anatomy and produce an approximately correct percentage of decussating fibers. We suggest that future algorithm development for RGVP tractography should take consideration of both of these two points.",

    "abstract": "We present EPISPOT, a fully joint framework which exploits large panels of epigenetic annotations as variant-level information to enhance molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. Thanks to a purpose-built Bayesian inferential algorithm, EPISPOT accommodates functional information for both cis and trans actions, including QTL hotspot effects. It effectively couples simultaneous QTL analysis of thousands of genetic variants and molecular traits, and hypothesis-free selection of biologically interpretable annotations which directly contribute to the QTL effects. This unified, epigenome-aided learning boosts statistical power and sheds light on the regulatory basis of the uncovered hits; EPISPOT therefore marks an essential step towards improving the challenging detection and functional interpretation of trans-acting genetic variants and hotspots. We illustrate the advantages of EPISPOT in simulations emulating real-data conditions and in a monocyte expression QTL study, which confirms known hotspots and finds other signals, as well as plausible mechanisms of action. In particular, by highlighting the role of monocyte DNase-I sensitivity sites from > 150 epigenetic annotations, we clarify the mediation effects and cell-type specificity of major hotspots close to the lysozyme gene. Our approach forgoes the daunting and underpowered task of one-annotation-at-a-time enrichment analyses for prioritising cis and trans QTL hits and is tailored to any transcriptomic, proteomic or metabolomic QTL problem. By enabling principled epigenome-driven QTL mapping transcriptome-wide, EPISPOT helps progress towards a better functional understanding of genetic regulation.",

    "abstract": "Visual scanning plays an important role in sampling visual information from the surrounding environments for a lot of everyday sensorimotor tasks, such as walking and car driving. In this paper, we consider the problem of visual scanning mechanism underpinning sensorimotor tasks in 3D dynamic environments. We exploit the use of eye tracking data as a behaviometric, for indicating the visuo-motor behavioral measures in the context of virtual driving. A new metric of visual scanning efficiency (VSE), which is defined as a mathematical divergence between a fixation distribution and a distribution of optical flows induced by fixations, is proposed by making use of a widely-known information theoretic tool, namely the square root of Jensen-Shannon divergence. Based on the proposed efficiency metric, a cognitive effort measure (CEM) is developed by using the concept of quantity of information. Psychophysical eye tracking studies, in virtual reality based driving, are conducted to reveal that the new metric of visual scanning efficiency can be employed very well as a proxy evaluation for driving performance. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed cognitive effort measure is demonstrated by a strong correlation between this measure and pupil size change. These results suggest that the exploitation of eye tracking data provides an effective behaviometric for sensorimotor activity.",

To probe this issue, we discretely perturbed (with optogenetics) activity in BLA[-&gt;]GC axons during taste deliveries. This perturbation strongly altered GC taste responses, but while the perturbation itself was tonic (2s), the alterations were not--changes preferentially aligned with the onset times of previously-described taste response epochs, and reduced evidence of palatability-related activity in the \"late-epoch\" of the responses without reducing the amount of taste identity information available in the \"middle epoch.\" Finally, BLA[-&gt;]GC perturbations changed behavior-linked taste response dynamics themselves, distinctively diminishing the abruptness of ensemble transitions into the late epoch.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe relative importance of ecological factors and species interactions for phytophagous insect species distributions has long been a controversial issue. Using field abundances of eight sympatric Tephritid fruit flies on 21 host plants, we inferred flies realized niches using joint species distribution modelling and network inference, on the community as a whole and separately on three groups of host plants. These inferences were then confronted to flies fundamental niches estimated through laboratory-measured fitnesses on host plants. Species abundances were mainly determined by host plants followed by climatic factors, with a minor role for competition between species sharing host plants. The relative importance of these factors mildly changed when we focused on particular host plant groups. Despite overlapping fundamental niches, specialists and generalists had almost distinct realized niches, with possible competitive exclusion of generalists by specialists on Cucurbitaceae, and different assembly rules: specialists were mainly influenced by their adaptation to host plants while generalist abundances varied regardless of their fundamental host use.",

    "abstract": "Homeothermy requires increased metabolic rates as temperatures decline below the thermoneutral zone, so homeotherms typically select microhabitats within or near their thermoneutral zones during periods of inactivity. However, many mammals and birds are heterotherms that relax internal controls on body temperature when maintaining a high, stable body temperature is energetically costly. Such heterotherms should be less tied to microhabitats near their thermoneutral zones, and because heterotherms spend more time in torpor and expend less energy at colder temperatures, heterotherms may even select microhabitats in which temperatures are well below their thermoneutral zones. We studied how temperature and daily torpor influence selection of diurnal roosts by a heterothermic bat (Myotis thysanodes). We (1) quantified the relationship between ambient temperature and daily duration of torpor, (2) simulated daily energy expenditure over a range of microhabitat (roost) temperatures, and (3) quantified the influence of roost temperature on roost selection. While warm roosts substantially reduced energy expenditure of simulated homeothermic bats, heterothermic bats modulated their use of torpor to maintain a constant level of energy expenditure over the course of a day. Daily torpor expanded the range of energetically economical microhabitats, such that roost selection was independent of roost temperature. Our work adds to a growing literature documenting functions of torpor beyond its historical conceptualization as a last-resort measure to save energy during extended or acute energetic stress.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxia is a condition in which cells, tissues, or organisms are deprived of sufficient oxygen supply. Aerobic organisms have a hypoxic response system, represented by hypoxia-inducible factor 1- (HIF1A), to adapt to this condition. Due to publication bias, there has been little focus on genes other than well-known signature hypoxia-inducible genes. Therefore, in this study, we performed a meta-analysis to identify novel hypoxia-inducible genes. We searched publicly available transcriptome databases to obtain hypoxia-related experimental data, retrieved the metadata, and manually curated it. We selected the genes that are differentially expressed by hypoxic stimulation, and evaluated their relevance in hypoxia by performing enrichment analyses. Next, we performed a bibliometric analysis using gene2pubmed data to examine genes that have not been well studied in relation to hypoxia. Gene2pubmed data that provides information about the relationship between gene and publication. We calculated and evaluated the number of reports and similarity coefficients of each gene to HIF1A, which is a representative gene in hypoxia studies. In this data-driven study, we report that several genes that were not known to be associated with hypoxia, including the G protein-coupled receptor 146 gene, are upregulated by hypoxic stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form mutualistic relationships with most land plant species and have long been considered as ancient asexuals. Long-term clonal evolution would be remarkable for a eukaryotic lineage and suggests the importance of alternative mechanisms to promote genetic variability facilitating adaptation. Here, we assessed the potential of transposable elements (TEs) for generating genomic diversity. The dynamic expression of TEs during Rhizophagus irregularis spore development suggests ongoing TE activity. We find Mutator-like elements located near genes belonging to highly expanded gene families. Characterising the epigenomic status of R. irregularis provides evidence of DNA methylation and small RNA production occurring at TE loci. Our results support a potential role for TEs in shaping the genome, and roles for DNA methylation and small RNA-mediated silencing in regulating TEs. A well-controlled balance between TE activity and repression may therefore contribute to genome evolution in AM fungi.",

    "abstract": "Statistical learning (SL) allows individuals to rapidly detect regularities in the sensory environment. We replicated previous findings showing that adult participants become sensitive to the implicit structure in a continuous speech stream of repeating tri-syllabic pseudowords within minutes, as measured by standard tests in the SL literature: a target detection task and a 2AFC word recognition task. Consistent with previous findings, we found only a weak correlation between these two measures of learning, leading us to question whether there is overlap between the information captured by these two tasks. Representational similarity analysis on reaction times measured during the target detection task revealed that reaction time data reflect sensitivity to transitional probability, triplet position, word grouping, and duplet pairings of syllables. However, individual performance on the word recognition task was not predicted by similarity measures derived for any of these four features. We conclude that online detection tasks provide richer and multi-faceted information about the SL process, as compared with 2AFC recognition tasks, and may be preferable for gaining insight into the dynamic aspects of SL.",

    "abstract": "Regulated recruitment and activity of motor proteins is essential for intracellular transport of cargoes, including messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs). Here we show that orchestration of oskar RNP transport in the Drosophila germline relies on the interplay of two double-stranded RNA binding proteins, Staufen and the dynein adaptor Egalitarian (Egl). We find that Staufen antagonizes Egl-mediated transport of oskar mRNA by dynein both in vitro and in vivo. Following delivery of nurse cell-synthesized oskar mRNA into the oocyte by dynein, recruitment of Staufen to the RNPs results in dissociation of Egl and a switch to kinesin-1-mediated translocation of the mRNA to its final destination at the posterior pole of the oocyte. We additionally show that Egl associates with staufen (stau) mRNA in the nurse cells, mediating its enrichment and translation in the ooplasm. Our observations identify a novel feed-forward mechanism, whereby dynein-dependent accumulation of stau mRNA, and thus protein, in the oocyte enables motor switching on oskar RNPs by downregulating dynein activity.",
