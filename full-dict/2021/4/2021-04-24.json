    "abstract": "Transfer RNAs (tRNA) are crucial adaptor molecules between messenger RNA (mRNA) and amino acids. Recent evidence in plants suggests that dicistronic tRNA-like structures also act as mobile signals for mRNA transcripts to move between distant tissues. Co-transcription is not a common feature in the plant nuclear genome and, in the few cases where polycistronic transcripts have been found, they include non-coding RNA species such as small nucleolar RNAs and microRNAs. It is not known, however, the extent to which dicistronic transcripts of tRNA and mRNAs are expressed in field-grown plants, or the factors contributing to their expression. We analysed tRNA-mRNA dicistronic transcripts in the major horticultural crop grapevine (Vitis vinifera) using a novel pipeline developed to identify dicistronic transcripts from high-throughput RNA sequencing data. We identified dicistronic tRNA-mRNA in leaf and berry samples from 22 commercial vineyards. Of the 124 tRNA genes that were expressed in both tissues, 18 tRNA were expressed forming part of 19 dicistronic tRNA-mRNAs. The presence and abundance of dicistronic molecules was tissue and geographic sub-region specific. In leaves, the expression patterns of dicistronic tRNA-mRNAs significantly correlated with tRNA expression, suggesting that their transcriptional regulation might be linked. We also found evidence of syntenic genomic arrangements of tRNAs and protein coding genes between grapevine and Arabidopsis thaliana, and widespread prevalence of dicistronic tRNA-mRNA transcripts among vascular land plants but no evidence of these transcripts in nonvascular lineages. This suggests that the appearance of plant vasculature and tRNA-mRNA occurred concurrently during the evolution of land plants.",

    "abstract": "Serotonin transporter gene variance has long been considered an essential factor contributing to depression. However, meta-analyses yielded inconsistent findings recently, asking for further understanding of the link between the gene and depression-related symptoms. One key feature of depression is anhedonia. While data exist on the effect of serotonin transporter gene knockout (5-HTT-/-) in rodents on consummatory and anticipatory anhedonia, with mixed outcomes, the effect on decisional anhedonia has not been investigated thus far. Here, we tested whether 5-HTT-/- contributes to decisional anhedonia. To this end, we established a novel touchscreen-based \"go/go\" task of visual decision-making. During the learning of stimulus discrimination, 5-HTT+/+ rats performed more optimal decision-making compared to 5-HTT-/- rats at the beginning, but this difference did not persist throughout the learning period. During stimulus generalization, the generalization curves were similar between both genotypes and did not alter as the learning progress. Interestingly, the response time in 5-HTT+/+ rats increased as the session increased in general, while 5-HTT-/- rats tended to decrease. The response time difference might indicate that 5-HTT-/- rats altered willingness to exert cognitive effort to the categorization of generalization stimuli. These results suggest that the effect of 5-HTT ablation on decisional anhedonia is mild and interacts with learning, explaining the discrepant findings on the link between 5-HTT gene and depression.",

    "abstract": "Circadian rhythms regulate cell proliferation and differentiation but circadian control of tissue regeneration remains elusive at the molecular level. Here, we show that proper myoblast differentiation and muscle regeneration are regulated by the circadian master regulators Per1 and Per2. Depletion of Per1 or Per2 suppressed myoblast differentiation in vitro and muscle regeneration in vivo, demonstrating their non-redundant functions. Both Per1 and Per2 were required for the activation of Igf2, an autocrine promoter of myoblast differentiation, accompanied by Per-dependent recruitment of RNA polymerase II, dynamic histone modifications at the Igf2 promoter and enhancer, and the promoter-enhancer interaction. This circadian epigenetic priming created a preferred time window for initiating myoblast differentiation. Consistently, muscle regeneration was faster if initiated at night when Per1, Per2, and Igf2 were highly expressed compared with morning. This study reveals the circadian timing as a significant factor for effective muscle cell differentiation and regeneration.\n\neTOC SummaryKatoku-Kikyo et al. show that the circadian master regulators Per1 and Per2 control the efficiency of myoblast differentiation via Igf2 activation.

    "abstract": "White matter hyperintensities (WMH) of presumed vascular origin are frequently found in MRIs of healthy older adults. WMH are also associated with aging and cognitive decline. Here, we compared and validated three freely available algorithms for WMH extraction: FreeSurfer, UBO Detector, and BIANCA (Brain Intensity AbNormality Classification Algorithm) using a longitudinal dataset comprising MRI data of cognitively healthy older adults (baseline N = 231, age range 64-87 years). As reference we manually segmented WMH in T1w, 3D FLAIR, 2D FLAIR images. These manual segmentations were then used to assess the segmentation accuracy of the different automated algorithms. Further, we assessed the relationships of WMH volume estimates provided by the algorithms with Fazekas scores and age. FreeSurfer underestimated the WMH volumes and scored worst in Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC = 0.434) but its WMH volumes strongly correlated with the Fazekas scores (rs = 0.73). BIANCA accomplished the highest DCS (0.602) with 3D FLAIR images. However, the relations with the Fazekas scores were only moderate, especially in the 2D FLAIR images (rs = 0.41), and many outlier WMH volumes were detected when exploring within-person trajectories (2D FLAIR: ~30%). UBO Detector performed similarly to BIANCA in DSC with both modalities and reached the best DSC in 2D FLAIR (0.531) without requiring a tailored training dataset. In addition, it achieved very high associations with the Fazekas scores (2D FLAIR: rs = 0.80).\n\nIn summary, our results emphasize the importance of carefully contemplating the choice of the WMH segmentation algorithm and MR-modality.",

    "abstract": "Biological neuronal networks (BNNs) are a source of inspiration and analogy making for researchers that focus on artificial neuronal networks (ANNs). Moreover, neuroscientists increasingly use ANNs as a model for the brain. Despite certain similarities between these two types of networks, important differences can be discerned. First, biological neural networks are sculpted by evolution and the constraints that it entails, whereas artificial neural networks are engineered to solve particular tasks. Second, the network topology of these systems, apart from some analogies that can be drawn, exhibits pronounced differences. Here, we examine strategies to construct recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that instantiate the network topology of brains of different species. We refer to such RNNs as bio-instantiated. We investigate the performance of bio-instantiated RNNs in terms of: i) the prediction performance itself, that is, the capacity of the network to minimize the desired function at hand in test data, and ii) speed of training, that is, how fast during training the network reaches its optimal performance. We examine bio-instantiated RNNs in working memory tasks where task-relevant information must be tracked as a sequence of events unfolds in time. We highlight the strategies that can be used to construct RNNs with the network topology found in BNNs, without sacrificing performance. Despite that we observe no enhancement of performance when compared to randomly wired RNNs, our approach demonstrates how empirical neural network data can be used for constructing RNNs, thus, facilitating further experimentation with biologically realistic network topologies, in contexts where such aspect is desired.",

    "abstract": "Up to seven members of the histone H1 family may contribute to chromatin compaction and its regulation in human somatic cells. In breast cancer cells, knock-down of multiple H1 variants deregulates many genes, promotes the appearance of genome-wide accessibility sites and triggers an interferon response via activation of heterochromatic repeats. However, how these changes in the expression profile relate to the re-distribution of H1 variants as well as to genome conformational changes have not been yet studied. Here, we combined ChIP-seq of five endogenous H1 variants with Chromosome Conformation Capture analysis in wild-type and H1 knock-down T47D cells. The results indicate that H1 variants coexist in the genome in two large groups depending on the local DNA GC content and that their distribution is robust with respect to multiple H1 depletion. Despite the small changes in H1 variants distribution, knock-down of H1 translated into more isolated but de-compacted chromatin structures at the scale of Topologically Associating Domains or TADs. Such changes in TAD structure correlated with a coordinated gene expression response of their resident genes. This is the first report describing simultaneous profiling of five endogenous H1 variants within a cell line and giving functional evidence of genome topology alterations upon H1 depletion in human cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Multiplexed and spatially resolved single-cell analyses that intend to study tissue heterogeneity and cell organization invariably face as a first step the challenge of cell classification. Accuracy and reproducibility are important for the down-stream process of counting cells, quantifying cell-cell interactions, and extracting information on disease-specific localized cell niches. Novel staining techniques make it possible to visualize and quantify large numbers of cell-specific molecular markers in parallel. However, due to variations in sample handling and artefacts from staining and scanning, cells of the same type may present different marker profiles both within and across samples. We address multiplexed immunofluorescence data from tissue microarrays of low grade gliomas and present a methodology using two different machine learning architectures and features insensitive to illumination to perform cell classification. The fully automated cell classification provides a measure of confidence for the decision and requires a comparably small annotated dataset for training, which can be created using freely available tools. Using the proposed method, we reached an accuracy of 83.1% on cell classification without the need for standardization of samples. Using our confidence measure, cells with low-confidence classifications could be excluded, pushing the classification accuracy to 94.5%. Next, we used the cell classification results to search for cell niches with an unsupervised learning approach based on graph neural networks. We show that the approach can re-detect specialized tissue niches in previously published data, and that our proposed cell classification leads to niche definitions that may be relevant for sub-groups of glioma, if applied to larger datasets.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDNA barcodes are a useful tool for discovering, understanding, and monitoring biodiversity which are critical tasks at a time of rapid biodiversity loss. However, widespread adoption of barcodes requires cost-effective and simple barcoding methods. We here present a workflow that satisfies these conditions. It was developed via \"innovation through subtraction\" and thus requires minimal lab equipment, can be learned within days, reduces the barcode sequencing cost to <10 cents, and allows fast turnaround from specimen to sequence by using the portable, real-time sequencer MinION.\n\nResultsWe describe cost-effective and rapid procedures for barcoding individual specimens with MinION sequencing. We illustrate how tagged amplicons can be obtained and sequenced with the portable, real-time MinION sequencer in many settings (field stations, biodiversity labs, citizen science labs, schools). We also provide amplicon coverage recommendations that are based on several runs of the latest generation of MinION flow cells (\"R10.3\") which suggest that each run can generate barcodes for >10,000 specimens. Next, we present a novel software, ONTbarcoder, which overcomes the bioinformatics challenges posed by MinION reads. The software is compatible with Windows 10, Macintosh, and Linux, has a graphical user interface (GUI), and can generate thousands of barcodes on a standard laptop within hours based on only two input files (FASTQ, demultiplexing file). We document that MinION barcodes are virtually identical to Sanger and Illumina barcodes for the same specimens (>99.99%) and provide evidence that MinION flow cells and reads have improved rapidly since 2018.\n\nConclusionsWe propose that barcoding with MinION is the way forward for government agencies, universities, museums, and schools because it combines low consumable and capital cost with scalability. Small projects can use the flow cell dongle (\"Flongle\") while large projects can rely on MinION flow cells that can be stopped and re-used after collecting sufficient data for a given project.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Pumilio1 (PUM1) can cause dramatically different phenotypes. We previously noted that phenotypic severity tracked with protein dosage: a mild mutation that reduces PUM1 levels by 25% causes late-onset ataxia, whereas PUM1 haploinsufficiency causes developmental delay and seizures. Why this difference in expression should cause such different phenotypes has been unclear: PUM1 targets are de-repressed to equal degrees in both cases, and the more severe mutation does not hinder PUM1s RNA-binding ability. We therefore developed a PUM1 interactome in the murine brain. We find that mild PUM1 loss de-represses PUM1-specific targets, but PUM1 haploinsufficiency disrupts several interactors and regulation of their targets. We validated these phenomena in patient-derived cell lines and show that normalizing PUM1 levels restores interactors and their targets to proper levels. We therefore propose that dosage sensitivity does not necessarily reflect a linear change in protein abundance but can involve distinct mechanisms. Studying the interactors of RBPs in vivo will be necessary to understand their functions in neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "During sleep, cortical network connectivity likely undergoes both synaptic potentiation and depression through system consolidation and homeostatic processes. However, how these modifications are coordinated across sleep stages remains largely unknown. Candidate mechanisms are Ponto-Geniculo-Occipital (PGO) waves, propagating across several structures during Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep and the transitional stage from non-REM sleep to REM sleep (pre-REM), and exhibiting sleep stage-specific dynamic patterns. To understand their impact on cortical plasticity, we built an acetylcholine-modulated neural mass model of PGO wave propagation through pons, thalamus and cortex, reproducing a broad range of electrophysiological characteristics across sleep stages. Using a population model of Spike-Time-Dependent Plasticity, we show that cortical circuits undergo different transient regimes depending on the sleep stage, with different impacts on plasticity. Specifically, PGO-induced recurrent cortical activities lead to the potentiation of cortico-cortical synapses during pre-REM, and to their depression during REM sleep. Overall, these results shed light on how the dynamical properties of sleep events propagating to cortical circuits can favor different types of local plastic changes. The variety of events occurring across sleep stages may thus be instrumental in controlling the reorganization of cortical networks from one day to the next.\n\nSignificance statementConsiderable evidence supports rescaling of cortical synaptic connec-tions during sleep, requiring both long term potentiation to consolidate newly acquired memories, and long-term depression to maintain homeostatic levels of brain activity. However, which aspects of sleep activity contribute to this bidirectional control of plasticity remains unclear. This computational modeling study suggests that widespread transient phenomena called Ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) waves, have a sleep-stage dependent effect on plasticity. The alternation between sleep stages can thus be exploited in combination with spontaneously occurring transients, to trigger both up- and down-regulating effects on cortical connectivity, and may explain why the basic structure of sleep-cycles is a well-preserved property across mammalian species.",

    "abstract": "A myriad of inflammatory cytokines regulate signaling pathways to maintain cellular homeostasis. The IKK complex is an integration hub for cytokines that govern NF-{kappa}B signaling. In response to inflammation, IKK is activated through recruitment to receptor-associated protein assemblies. How and what information IKK complexes transmit about the milieu are open questions. Here we track dynamics of IKK complexes and nuclear NF-{kappa}B to identify upstream signaling features that determine same-cell responses. Experiments and modeling of single complexes reveals their size, number, and timing relays cytokine-specific information with feedback control that is independent of transcription. Our results provide evidence for variable-gain stochastic pooling, a noise-reducing motif that enables parsimonious and cytokine-specific information transfer. We propose that emergent properties of stochastic pooling are general principles of receptor signaling.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA variable-gain stochastic pooling motif mediates robust and tunable information transmission from the extracellular milieu into the cell.",

In previous studies, the TYLCV isolates were partially characterized using molecular tests for small fragments not the entire length of the virus. Sample of TYLCV-infected tomato has applied in this study to diagnose complete sequence of TYLCV isolate. Three sets of primers that belong to three well-identified strains in Iraq were used in a PCR technique and interestingly the results were negative. A new Iraqi isolate has been characterized as a first novel Iraqi isolate detected ever using next generation (NGS) and bioinformatics techniques. The NGS platform has produced about 78,232,062 paired reads of the TYLCV-infected tomato var. Oula F1. The complete raw reads of the infected variety have been analyzed using RepeatExplorer pipeline and Map to reference. The full sequence of TYLCV was reconstructed and extracted to consist of 2770 nt and then deposited in Genbank under accession number MT583814. Copy numbers and genome proportion of this sequence have been calculated that were 3523 and 0,086% respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of full nucleotide sequences confirmed close relationship to Iranian isolate (TYLCV-Kahnooj) than other published viruses.

In this study, we have explored the genetic bases of the antagonism between resistance and tolerance during the response to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in budding yeast. We show that inactivation of protein kinase A (PKA) by H2O2 signaling induces an abrupt transition from normal homeostatic function to a stress-tolerant state by protecting the growth machinery, hence maximizing cellular fitness in a changing environment. This model system paves the way for developing antiproliferative strategies that target both resistance and tolerance mechanisms to prevent relapse.",

    "abstract": "Understanding genetic connectivity plays a crucial role in species conservation decisions, and genetic connectivity is an important component of modern fisheries management. In this study, we investigated the population genetics of four endemic Lates species of Lake Tanganyika (Lates stappersii, L. microlepis, L. mariae and L. angustifrons) using reduced-representation genomic sequencing methods. We find the four species to be strongly differentiated from one another (mean interspecific FST = 0.665), with no evidence for contemporary admixture. We also find evidence for strong genetic structure within L. mariae, with the majority of individuals from the most southern sampling site forming a genetic group that is distinct from the individuals at other sampling sites. We find evidence for much weaker structure within the other three species (L. stappersii, L. microlepis, and L. angustifrons). Our ability to detect this weak structure despite small and unbalanced sample sizes and imprecise geographic sampling locations suggests the possibility for further structure undetected in our study. We call for further research into the origins of the genetic differentiation in these four species--particularly that of L. mariae--which may be important for conservation and management of this culturally and economically important clade of fish.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionBiomedical research has grown increasingly cooperative, with several large consortia compiling and sharing epigenomic data. Since data are typically preprocessed by consortia prior to distribution, the implementation of new pipelines can lead to different versions of the same dataset. Analytic frameworks also constantly evolve to incorporate cutting-edge methods and shifting best practices. However, it remains unknown how differences in data and analytic versions alter the results of epigenome-wide analyses, which has broad implications for the replicability of epigenetic associations. Thus, we assessed the impact of these changes using a subsample of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed two versions of DNA methylation data, processed using separate preprocessing and analytic pipelines, to examine associations between childhood adversity and prenatal smoking exposure on DNA methylation at age 7. We performed two sets of analyses: (1) epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS); (2) Structured Life Course Modeling Approach (SLCMA), a two-stage method that models time-dependent effects. We also compared results from the SLCMA using more recent methodological recommendations.\n\nResultsDifferences between ALSPAC data versions impacted both EWAS and SLCMA analyses, yielding different sets of associations at conventional p-value thresholds. However, the magnitude and direction of associations was generally consistent between data versions, regardless of significance thresholds. Updating the SLCMA analytic version similarly altered top associations, but time-dependent effects remained concordant.\n\nConclusionsChanges to data and analytic versions influenced the results of epigenome-wide studies, particularly when using p-value thresholds as reference points for successful replication and stability.",

    "abstract": "Genome-Wide Association studies have typically been limited to single phenotypes, given that high dimensional phenotypes incur a large multiple comparisons burden: ~1 million tests across the genome times the number of phenotypes. Recent work demonstrates that a Multivariate Omnibus Statistic Test (MOSTest) is well powered to discover genomic effects distributed across multiple phenotypes. Applied to cortical brain MRI morphology measures, MOSTest has resulted in a drastic improvement in power to discover loci when compared to established approaches (min-P). One question that arises is how well these discovered loci replicate in independent data. Here we perform 10 times cross validation within 35,644 individuals from UK Biobank for imaging measures of cortical area, thickness and sulcal depth (>1,000 dimensionality for each). By deploying a replication method that aggregates discovered effects distributed across multiple phenotypes, termed PolyVertex Score (PVS), we demonstrate a higher replication yield and comparable replication rate of discovered loci for MOSTest (# replicated loci: 348-845, replication rate: 94-95%) in independent data when compared with the established min-P approach (# replicated loci: 31-68, replication rate: 65-80%). An out-of-sample replication of discovered loci was conducted with a sample of 8,336 individuals from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development(R) (ABCD) study, who are on average 50 years younger than UK Biobank individuals. We observe a higher replication yield and comparable replication rate of MOSTest compared to min-P. This finding underscores the importance of using well-powered multivariate techniques for both discovery and replication of high dimensional phenotypes in Genome-Wide Association studies.",

The stage-II network applied the perceptual loss to preserve image structural features by updating the parameters of the stage-I network via backpropagation. The stage-I network was trained using small image patches simulated with five types of motion, i.e., rotational, sinusoidal, random, elastic deformation and through-plane, to mimic actual liver motion patterns. The stage-II network training used full-size images with the same types of motion as the stage-I network. The motion reduction deep learning model was testing using simulated motion images and images with real motion artifacts. The resulted images after two-stage processing demonstrated substantially reduced motion artifacts while preserved anatomic details without image blurriness.

Adventitious root initiation (ARI) is controlled by interconnected transcriptional and hormonal networks, but there is little knowledge of the genetic and molecular programs orchestrating these networks. Thus, we have applied genome-wide transcriptome profiling to elucidate the profound transcriptional reprogramming events preceding ARI. These reprogramming events are associated with downregulation of cytokinin (CK) signaling and response genes, which could be triggers for ARI. Interestingly, we found that CK free-base content declined during ARI, due to downregulation of de novo CK biosynthesis and upregulation of CK inactivation pathways. We also found that MYC2-dependent jasmonate (JA) signaling inhibits ARI by downregulating expression of the CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE1 gene. We also demonstrated that JA and CK synergistically activate expression of RELATED to APETALA2.6 LIKE (RAP2.6L) transcription factor, and constitutive expression of this transcription factor strongly inhibits ARI. Collectively, our findings reveal that previously unknown genetic interactions between JA and CK play key roles in ARI",

    "abstract": "Activation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) produces analgesia in a variety of preclinical models of pain; however, engagement of central CB1 receptors is accompanied by unwanted side effects, such as tolerance and dependence. Efforts to develop novel analgesics have focused on targeting peripheral CB1 receptors to circumvent central CB1-related side effects. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of acute and repeated dosing with the peripherally selective CB1-preferring agonist CB-13 on nociception and central CB1-related phenotypes in an inflammatory model of pain in mice. We also evaluated cellular mechanisms underlying CB-13-induced antinociception in vitro using cultured mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. CB-13 reduced inflammation-induced mechanical allodynia in a peripheral CB1 receptor-dependent manner and relieved inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia. In cultured mouse DRG neurons, CB-13 reduced TRPV1 sensitization and neuronal hyperexcitability induced by the inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E2, providing potential mechanistic explanations for the analgesic actions of peripheral CB1 receptor activation. With acute dosing, phenotypes associated with central CB1 receptor activation occurred only at a dose of CB-13 approximately 10-fold the ED50 for reducing allodynia. Strikingly, repeated dosing resulted in both analgesic tolerance and CB1 receptor dependence, even at a dose that did not produce central CB1 receptor-mediated phenotypes on acute dosing. This suggests repeated CB-13 dosing leads to increased CNS exposure and unwanted engagement of central CB1 receptors. Thus, caution is warranted regarding therapeutic use of CB-13 with the goal of avoiding CNS side effects. Nonetheless, the clear analgesic effect of acute peripheral CB1 receptor activation suggests that peripherally restricted cannabinoids are a viable target for novel analgesic development.",

    "abstract": "Cultivar mixtures slow polycyclic epidemics but may also affect the evolution of pathogen populations by diversifying the selection pressures exerted by their plant hosts at field scale. We compared the dynamics of natural populations of the fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici in pure stands and in three binary mixtures of wheat cultivars (one susceptible cultivar and one cultivar carrying the recently broken-down Stb16q gene) over two annual field epidemics. We combined analyses of population  size based on disease severity, and of population  composition based on changes in the frequency of virulence against Stb16q in seedling assays with more than 3000 strains. Disease reductions were observed in mixtures late in the epidemic, at the whole canopy scale and on both cultivars, suggesting the existence of a reciprocal  protective effect. The three cultivar proportions in the mixtures (0.25, 0.5 and 0.75) modulated the decrease in (i) the size of the pathogen population relative to the two pure stands, (ii) the size of the virulent subpopulation, and (iii) the frequency of virulence relative to the pure stand of the cultivar carrying Stb16q. Our findings suggest that optimal proportions may differ slightly between the three indicators considered. We argued potential trade-offs that should be taken into account when deploying a resistance gene in cultivar mixtures: between the dual objectives  efficacy and  durability, and between the  size and  frequency of the virulent subpopulation. Based on current knowledge, it remains unclear whether virulent subpopulation size or frequency has the largest influence on interepidemic virulence transmission.",

    "abstract": "Penelope-like elements (PLEs) are an enigmatic clade of retroelements whose reverse transcriptases (RTs) share a most recent common ancestor with telomerase RTs. The single ORF of canonical EN+ PLEs encodes RT and a C-terminal GIY-YIG endonuclease (EN) that enables intrachromosomal integration, while EN-PLEs lack endonuclease and are generally restricted to chromosome termini. EN+ PLEs have only been found in animals, except for one case of horizontal transfer to conifers, while EN-PLEs occur in several kingdoms. Here we report a new, deep-branching PLE clade with a permuted domain order, whereby an N-terminal GIY-YIG endonuclease is linked to a C-terminal RT by a short domain with a characteristic Zn-finger-like motif. These N-terminal EN+ PLEs share a structural organization, including pseudo-LTRs and complex tandem/inverted insertions, with canonical EN+ PLEs from Penelope/Poseidon, Neptune and Nematis clades, and show insertion bias for microsatellites, but lack hammerhead ribozyme motifs. However, their phylogenetic distribution is much broader. The Naiad clade is found in numerous invertebrate phyla, where they can reach tens of thousands of copies per genome. Naiads in spiders and clams independently evolved to encode selenoproteins. Chlamys, which lack the CCHH motif universal to PLE endonucleases, occur in green algae, spike mosses (targeting ribosomal DNA) and the slime mold Physarum. Unlike canonical PLEs, RTs of N-terminal EN+ PLEs contain the insertion-in-fingers domain, strengthening the link between PLEs and telomerases. Additionally, we describe Hydra, a novel metazoan C-terminal EN+ clade. Overall, we conclude that PLE diversity, distribution and abundance is comparable to non-LTR and LTR-retrotransposons.",

    "abstract": "Most human cells require anchorage for survival. Cell-substrate adhesion activates diverse signaling pathways, without which cells undergo anoikis - a form of programmed cell death1. Acquisition of anoikis resistance is a pivotal step in cancer disease progression, as metastasizing cancer cells often lose firm attachment to surrounding tissue2-5. In these poorly attached states, cells adopt rounded morphologies and form small hemispherical plasma membrane protrusions called blebs6-13. Bleb function has been thoroughly investigated in the context of amoeboid migration but is far less examined in other scenarios14-19. Here we show by quantitative subcellular 3D imaging and manipulation of cell morphological states that blebbing triggers the formation of plasma membrane-proximal signaling hubs that confer anoikis resistance. Specifically, we discovered in melanoma cells that blebbing generates plasma membrane contours, which recruit curvature-sensing septin proteins as scaffolds for constitutively active mutant NRAS and effectors. These signaling hubs activate ERK and PI3K - canonical promoters of pro-survival pathways. Inhibition of blebs or septins has little effect on the survival of well-adhered cells, but in detached cells causes NRAS mislocalization, reduced MAPK and PI3K activity, and ultimately, death. This unveils an unanticipated morphological requirement for mutant NRAS to operate as an effective oncoprotein. Moreover, we find that though some BRAF mutant melanoma do not rely on this survival pathway in a basal state, BRAF/MEK inhibition strongly sensitizes them to both bleb and septin inhibition. Importantly, we demonstrate that fibroblasts engineered to sustain blebbing acquire the same anoikis resistance as cancer cells even without harboring oncogenic mutations. These data define a role for blebs as potent signaling organelles capable of integrating myriad cellular information flows into concerted cellular responses, in this case granting robust anoikis resistance.",

    "abstract": "Septins are a family of conserved filament-forming proteins that function in a variety of processes including cell cycle progression, cell morphogenesis and autophagy. Despite their conservation from yeast to humans, the number of septin genes within an organism varies and higher eukaryotes express many septin isoforms due to alternative splicing. It is unclear how variability in septin complex composition influences the biophysical properties of septin polymers. Here we report that a complex duplication event within the CDC11 locus in the fungus, Ashbya gossypii, gave rise to two similar, but distinct Cdc11 proteins, Cdc11a and Cdc1b. CDC11b transcription is developmentally regulated producing different ratios of Cdc11a and b complexes during Ashbyas lifecycle. Moreover, deletion of either CDC11a or CDC11b results in distinct cell polarity defects. Remarkably, despite substantial identity in amino acid sequence, Cdc11a and Cdc11b complexes have distinct biophysical properties with clear filament length and membrane-binding ability differences. Thus, septin subunit composition has functional consequences for filament properties and such functional plasticity can be exploited for distinct biophysical properties and cell functions.",

    "abstract": "Cell cycle gene expression programs fuel proliferation and are dysregulated in many cancers. The retinoblastoma-family proteins, RB, p130/RBL2 and p107/RBL1, coordinately repress cell cycle gene expression, inhibiting proliferation and suppressing tumorigenesis. Ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation is essential to cell cycle control, and numerous proliferative regulators, tumor suppressors, and oncoproteins are ubiquitinated. However, little is known about the role of ubiquitin signaling in controlling RB-family proteins. A systems genetics analysis of several hundred CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function screens suggested the potential regulation of the RB-network by cyclin F, a substrate recognition receptor for the SCF family of E3 ligases. We demonstrate that RBL2/p130 is a direct substrate of SCFcyclin F. We map a cyclin F regulatory site to a flexible linker in the p130 pocket domain, and show that this site mediates binding, stability, and ubiquitination. Expression of a non-degradable p130 represses cell cycle gene expression and strongly reduces proliferation. These data suggest that SCFcyclin F plays a key role in the CDK-RB network and raises the possibility that aberrant p130 degradation could dysregulate the cell cycle in human cancers.",

    "abstract": "The pairing of homologous chromosomes (homologs) in meiosis is essential for distributing the correct numbers of chromosomes into haploid gametes. In budding yeast, pairing depends on the formation of 150-200 Spo11-mediated double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are distributed among 16 homolog pairs, but it is not known if all, or only a subset of these DSBs, contribute to the close juxtaposition of homologs. Having established a system to measure the position of fluorescently tagged chromosomal loci in 3D space over time, we analyzed locus trajectories to determine how frequently, and how long, loci spend colocalized or apart. Continuous imaging revealed highly heterogeneous cell-to-cell behavior of foci, with the majority of cells exhibiting a \"mixed\" phenotype where foci move into and out of proximity, even at late stages of prophase, suggesting that the axial structures of the synaptonemal complex may be more dynamic than anticipated. The observed plateaus of the mean-squared change in distance (MSCD) between foci informed the development of a biophysical model of two diffusing polymers that captures the loss of centromere linkages as cells enter meiosis, nuclear confinement, and the formation of Spo11-dependent linkages. The predicted number of linkages per chromosome in our theoretical model closely approximates the small number (~2-4) of estimated synapsis-initiation sites, suggesting that excess DSBs have negligible effects on the overall juxtaposition of homologs. These insights into the dynamic in-terchromosomal behavior displayed during homolog pairing demonstrate the power of combining time-resolved in vivo analysis with modeling at the granular level.\n\nSignificance StatementEssential for sexual reproduction, meiosis is a specialized cell division required for the production of haploid gametes. Critical to this process is the pairing, recombination, and segregation of homologous chromosomes (homologs). While pairing and recombination are linked, it is not known how many linkages are sufficient to hold homologs in proximity. Here, we reveal that random diffusion and the placement of a small number of linkages are sufficient to establish the apparent \"pairing\" of homologs. We also show that colocalization between any two loci is more dynamic than anticipated. Our study is the first to provide observations of live interchromosomal dynamics during meiosis and illustrates the power of combining single-cell measurements with theoretical polymer modeling.",

    "abstract": "Short tandem repeat (STR) instability is causally linked to pathologic transcriptional silencing in a subset of repeat expansion disorders. In fragile X syndrome (FXS), instability of a single CGG STR tract is thought to repress FMR1 via local DNA methylation. Here, we report the acquisition of more than ten Megabase-sized H3K9me3 domains in FXS, including a 5-8 Megabase block around FMR1. Distal H3K9me3 domains encompass synaptic genes with STR instability, and spatially co-localize in trans concurrently with FMR1 CGG expansion and the dissolution of TADs. CRISPR engineering of mutation-length FMR1 CGG to normal-length preserves heterochromatin, whereas cut-out to pre-mutation-length attenuates a subset of H3K9me3 domains. Overexpression of a pre-mutation-length CGG de-represses both FMR1 and distal heterochromatinized genes, indicating that long-range H3K9me3-mediated silencing is exquisitely sensitive to STR length. Together, our data uncover a genome-wide surveillance mechanism by which STR tracts spatially communicate over vast distances to heterochromatinize the pathologically unstable genome in FXS.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryHeterochromatinization of distal synaptic genes with repeat instability in fragile X is reversible by overexpression of a pre-mutation length CGG tract.",

    "abstract": "-1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) is a translational recoding mechanism used by many viral and cellular mRNAs. -1 PRF occurs at a heptanucleotide slippery sequence and is stimulated by a downstream RNA structure, most often in the form of a pseudoknot. The utilization of -1 PRF to produce proteins encoded by the -1 reading frame is wide-spread in RNA viruses, but relatively rare in cellular mRNAs. In human, only three such cases of -1 PRF events have been reported, all involving retroviral-like genes and protein products. To evaluate the extent of -1 PRF utilization in the human transcriptome, we have developed a computational scheme for identifying putative pseudoknot-dependent -1 PRF events and applied the method to a collection of 43,191 human mRNAs in the NCBI RefSeq database. In addition to the three reported cases, our study identified more than two dozen putative -1 PRF cases. The genes involved in these cases are genuine cellular genes without a viral origin. Moreover, in more than half of these cases, the frameshift site locates far upstream (>250 nt) from the stop codon of the 0 reading frame, which is nonviral-like. Using dual luciferase assays in HEK293T cells, we confirmed that the -1 PRF signals in the mRNAs of CDK5R2 and SEMA6C are functional in inducing efficient frameshifting. Our findings have significant implications in expanding the repertoire of the -1 PRF phenomenon and the protein-coding capacity of the human transcriptome.",

    "abstract": "Various subunits of mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes display loss-of-function mutations characteristic of tumor suppressors in different cancers, but an additional role for SWI/SNF supporting cell survival in distinct cancer contexts is emerging. In particular, genetic dependence on the catalytic subunit BRG1/SMARCA4 has been observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), yet the feasibility of direct therapeutic targeting of SWI/SNF catalytic activity in leukemia remains unknown. Here, we evaluated the activity of dual BRG1/BRM ATPase inhibitors across a genetically diverse panel of cancer cell lines and observed that hematopoietic cancer cell lines were among the most sensitive compared to other lineages. This result was striking in comparison to data from pooled short hairpin RNA screens, which showed that only a subset of leukemia cell lines display sensitivity to BRG1 knockdown. We demonstrate that combined genetic knockdown of BRG1 and BRM is required to recapitulate the effects of dual inhibitors, suggesting that SWI/SNF dependency in human leukemia extends beyond a predominantly BRG1-driven mechanism. Through gene expression and chromatin accessibility studies, we show that the dual inhibitors act at genomic loci associated with oncogenic transcription factors, and observe a downregulation of leukemic pathway genes including MYC, a well-established target of BRG1 activity in AML. Overall, small molecule inhibition of BRG1/BRM induced common transcriptional responses across leukemia models resulting in a spectrum of cellular phenotypes. Our studies reveal the breadth of SWI/SNF dependency and support targeting SWI/SNF catalytic function as a potential therapeutic strategy in AML.",

Recent evidence suggests that R-loops can form in the proximity of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within transcriptionally active regions. Yet, how the vulnerability of R-loops is overcome during DSB repair remains unclear. Here, we identify RAP80 as a factor suppressing the vulnerability of ssDNA in R-loops and chromosome translocations and deletions during DSB repair. Mechanistically, RAP80 prevents unscheduled nucleolytic processing of ssDNA in R-loops by CtIP. This mechanism promotes efficient DSB repair via transcription-associated end-joining dependent on BRCA1, Pol{theta}, and LIG1/3. Thus, RAP80 suppresses the vulnerability of R-loops during DSB repair, thereby precluding genomic abnormalities in a critical component of the genome caused by deleterious R-loop processing.",

    "abstract": "Reflectin is a cationic, block copolymeric protein that mediates the dynamic fine-tuning of color and brightness of light reflected from nanostructured Bragg reflectors in iridocyte skin cells of squids. In vivo, neuronally activated phosphorylation of reflectin triggers its assembly, driving osmotic dehydration of the membrane-bounded Bragg lamellae containing the protein to simultaneously shrink the lamellar thickness and spacing while increasing its refractive index contrast, thus tuning the wavelength and increasing the brightness of reflectance. In vitro, we show that reduction in repulsive net charge of the purified, recombinant reflectin - either (for the first time) by generalized anionic screening with salt, or by pH titration - drives a finely tuned, precisely calibrated increase in size of the resulting multimeric assemblies. The calculated effects of phosphorylation in vivo are consistent with these effects observed in vitro. X-ray scattering analyses confirm the sphericity, size and low polydispersity of the assemblies. Precise proportionality between assembly size and charge-neutralization is enabled by the demonstrated rapid dynamic arrest of multimer growth. The resulting stability of reflectin assemblies with time ensures reciprocally precise control of the particle number concentration, thereby encoding a precise calibration between the extent of neuronal signaling, osmotic pressure, and the resulting optical changes. The results presented here strongly suggest that it is charge neutralization, rather than any change in aromatic content, that is the proximate driver of assembly, fine-tuning a colligative property-based nanostructured biological machine.

The role of chemical communication between the cyanobacterium and the microbial community harboured as epibionts within its phycosphere is at an initial stage of research and little is understood about its specificity. Herein, we present insight into the role of a bacterial epibiont in regulating production of cyanobacterial oligopeptides microviridins, well-known elastase inhibitors with presumed anti-grazing effects, in an ecologically important cyanobacterial genus Nostoc. Heterologous expression and identification of specific signal molecules from the epibiont suggest the role of a quorum sensing-based interaction. Further, physiological experiments show an increase in microviridin production without affecting cyanobacterial growth and photosynthetic activity. Simultaneously, oligopeptides presenting a selective inhibition pattern provide support for their specific function in response to the presence of cohabitant epibionts. Thus, the chemical interaction revealed in our study provides an example of an interspecies signalling pathway monitoring the bacterial flora around the cyanobacterial filaments and induction of intrinsic species-specific metabolic responses.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe regulation of cyanopeptide production beyond microcystin is essential to understand their ecological role in complex microbial communities, e.g. harmful cyanobacterial blooms.

    "abstract": "As the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic expands, genomic epidemiology and whole genome sequencing are being constantly used to investigate its transmissions and evolution. In the backdrop of the global emergence of \"variants of concern\" (VOCs) during December 2020 and an upsurge in a state in the western part of India since January 2021, whole genome sequencing and analysis of spike protein mutations using sequence and structural approaches was undertaken to identify possible new variants and gauge the fitness of current circulating strains.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis revealed that the predominant clade in circulation was a distinct newly identified lineage B.1.617 possessing common signature mutations D111D, G142D, L452R, E484Q, D614G and P681R, in the spike protein including within the receptor binding domain (RBD). Of these, the mutations at residue positions 452, 484 and 681 have been reported in other globally circulating lineages. The structural analysis of RBD mutations L452R and E484Q along with P681R in the furin cleavage site, revealed that these may possibly result in increased ACE2 binding and rate of S1-S2 cleavage resulting in better transmissibility. The same two RBD mutations indicated decreased binding to select monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and may affect their neutralization potential. Experimental validation against a wider panel of mAbs, sera from vaccinees and those that recovered from natural infection needs to be studied.\n\nThe emergence of such local variants through the accumulation of convergent mutations during the COVID-19 second wave needs to be further investigated for their public health impact in the rest of the country and its possibility of becoming a VOC.",

    "abstract": "The tryptophan (Trp)-derived plant secondary metabolites, including camalexin, 4-hydroxy-indole-3-carbonylnitrile (4OH-ICN), and indole glucosinolate (IGS), show broad-spectrum antifungal activity. However, the upstream regulators of these metabolic pathways among different plant species in response to fungus infection are rarely studied. In this study, our results revealed a positive role of WRKY33 in host resistance to Alternaria brassicicola by directly regulating the transcription of genes involved in the biosynthesis and atypical hydrolysis of IGS both in Arabidopsis and Chinese kale. Indole-3-yl-methylglucosinolate (I3G) and 4-methoxyindole-3-yl-methylglucosinolate (4MI3G) are the main components of IGS. WRKY33 induces the expression of MYB51 and CYP83B1 which promotes the biosynthesis of I3G, the precursor of 4MI3G. Moreover, it also directly activates the expression of CYP81F2, IGMT1, and IGMT2 to drive side chain modification of I3G to produce 4MI3G, which is in turn hydrolyzed by PEN2. However, Chinese kale showed a more severe symptom than Arabidopsis when infected by Alternaria brassicicola. Comparative analyses of the origin and evolution of Trp-metabolism indicate that the loss of camalexin biosynthesis in Brassica crops during evolution might attenuate the resistance of crops to Alternaria brassicicola. As a result, IGS metabolic pathway mediated by WRKY33 becomes essential for Chinese kale to deter Alternaria brassicicola. Our results highlight the differential regulation of Trp-derived camalexin and IGS biosynthetic pathways in plant immunity between Arabidopsis and Brassica crops.\n\nOne-sentence SummaryPathogen-responsive WRKY33 directly regulates indole glucosinolates biosynthesis and atypical hydrolysis, conferring to host resistance to Alternaria brassicicola in Arabidopsis and Brassica crops.",

    "abstract": "SAMBA has been identified as a plant-specific regulator of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) which controls unidirectional cell cycle progression in Arabidopsis, but so far its role was not studied in monocots. Here, the association of SAMBA with APC/C was shown to be conserved in maize. Two samba CRISPR alleles showed growth defects that aggravated with plant age such as dwarfed plants due to shortened upper leaf length, erect leaf architecture, and reduced leaf size due to an altered cell division rate and cell expansion. Despite the fact that in both alleles the frameshift occurred at the same position, the two alleles differed in the severity and developmental onset of the phenotypes, because samba-1 represented a knock-out allele, while translation re-initiation in samba-3 resulted in a truncated protein that was still able to interact with the APC/C and regulate its function, albeit with altered APC/C activity or efficiency. Our data are consistent with a dosage-dependent role for SAMBA to control developmental processes for which a change in growth rate is pivotal.",

    "abstract": "IgG specific for members of the Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1(PfEMP1) family, which mediates receptor- and tissue-specific sequestration of infected erythrocytes (IEs), is a central component of naturally acquired malaria immunity. PfEMP1-specific IgG is thought to protect via inhibition of IE sequestration, and through IgG-Fc Receptor (Fc{gamma}R) mediated phagocytosis and killing of antibody-opsonized IEs. The affinity of afucosylated IgG to Fc{gamma}RIIIa is elevated up to 40-fold compared to fucosylated IgG, resulting in enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Most IgG in plasma is fully fucosylated, but afucosylated IgG is elicited in response to enveloped viruses and to paternal alloantigens during pregnancy. Here we show that naturally acquired PfEMP1-specific IgG is likewise markedly afucosylated in a stable and exposure-dependent manner, and efficiently induces Fc{gamma}RIIIa-dependent natural killer (NK) cell degranulation. In contrast, immunization with a soluble subunit vaccine based on VAR2CSA-type PfEMP1 resulted in fully fucosylated specific IgG. These results have implications for understanding natural and vaccine-induced antibody-mediated protective immunity to malaria.\n\nSummaryAfucosylated IgG has enhanced Fc-receptor affinity and functionality, and is formed specifically against membrane proteins of enveloped viruses. We show that this also applies to Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane-specific IgG induced by natural infection, but not by soluble PfEMP1 vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Agrobacterium tumefaciens, is a member of the Alphaproteobacteria that pathogenizes plants, and associates with biotic and abiotic surfaces via a single cellular pole. A. tumefaciens produces the unipolar polysaccharide (UPP) at the site of surface contact. UPP production is normally surface-contact inducible, but elevated levels of the second messenger cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (cdGMP) bypass this requirement. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the UPP has a central polysaccharide component. Using an A. tumefaciens derivative with elevated cdGMP and mutationally disabled for other dispensable polysaccharides, a series of related genetic screens have identified a large number of genes involved in UPP biosynthesis, most of which are Wzx-Wzy-type polysaccharide biosynthetic components. Extensive analyses of UPP production in these mutants have revealed that the UPP is comprised of two genetically, chemically and spatially discrete forms of polysaccharide, and that each requires a specific Wzy-type polymerase. Other important biosynthetic, processing and regulatory functions for UPP production are also revealed, some of which are common to both polysaccharides, and a subset of which are specific to each species. Many of the UPP genes identified are conserved among diverse rhizobia, whereas others are more lineage specific.\n\nPlain language summaryBacteria attach to a wide variety of surfaces including host tissues, via externalized structures described as adhesins.

    "abstract": "Fitness landscapes reflect the adaptive potential of viruses. There is no information on how fitness peaks evolve when a virus replicates extensively in a controlled cell culture environment. Here we report the construction of Self-Organized Maps (SOMs), based on deep sequencing reads of three amplicons of the NS5A-NS5B-coding region of hepatitis C virus (HCV). A two-dimensional neural network was constructed and organized according to sequence relatedness. The third dimension of the fitness profile was given by the haplotype frequencies at each neuron. Fitness maps were derived for 44 HCV populations that share a common ancestor that was passaged up to 210 times in human hepatoma Huh-7.5 cells. As the virus increased its adaptation to the cells, the number of fitness peaks expanded, and their distribution shifted in sequence space. The landscape consisted of an extended basal platform, and a lower number of protruding higher fitness peaks. The function that relates fitness level and peak abundance corresponds a power law, a relationship observed with other complex natural phenomena. The dense basal platform may serve as spring-board to attain high fitness peaks. The study documents a highly dynamic, double-layer fitness landscape of HCV when evolving in a monotonous cell culture environment. This information may help interpreting HCV fitness landscapes in complex in vivo environments.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe study provides for the first time the fitness landscape of a virus in the course of its adaptation to a cell culture environment, in absence of external selective constraints. The deep sequencing-based self-organized maps document a two-layer fitness distribution with an ample basal platform, and a lower number of protruding, high fitness peaks. This landscape structure offers potential benefits for virus resilience to mutational inputs.",

    "abstract": "Many enteric viruses are found in pig farms around the world and can cause death of animals or important production losses for breeders. Among the wide spectrum of enteric viral species, porcine Sapelovirus (PSV), porcine Kobuvirus (PKoV) and porcine Astrovirus (PAstV) are frequently found in pig feces. In this study we investigated sixteen pig farms in Corsica, France, to evaluate the circulation of three enteric viruses (PKoV, PAstV-1 and PSV). In addition to the three viruses studied by RT-qPCR (908 pig feces samples), 26 stool samples were tested using the Next Generation Sequencing method (NGS). Our results showed viral RNA detection rates (i) of 62.0% [58.7-65.1] (n = 563/908) for PSV, (ii) of 44.8% [41.5-48.1] (n = 407/908) for PKoV and (iii) of 8.6% [6.8-10.6] (n = 78/908) for PAstV-1. Significant differences were observed for all three viruses according to age (P-value = 2.4e-13 for PAstV-1; 2.4e-12 for PKoV and 0.005 for PSV). The type of breeding was significantly associated with RNA detection only for PAstV-1 (P-value = 9.6e-6). Among the 26 samples tested with NGS method, consensus sequences corresponding to 10 different species of virus were obtained This study provides first insight on the presence of three common porcine enteric viruses in France. We also showed that they are frequently encountered in pigs born and bred in Corsica, which demonstrates endemic local circulation.\n\nImportanceThis study provides important information in the comprehension of the epidemiology of different viruses circulating in swine farms. We have shown the great diversity of viruses that could be present in extensive farms. Moreover, to our knowledge, this is the first detection of these different viruses in France. So far, this study has to be considered as a first step in the study of enteric viruses in Corsican pig farms.",

    "abstract": "The protein localization in cells had been analyzed by the fluorescent labeling by indirect immunofluorescence and fluorescent protein tagging. However, the relationships between the localizations between different proteins had not been analyzed by artificial intelligence. In this study, we applied the generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate the protein localizations each other, in which the generation was dependent on the types of cells and the relationships between the proteins. Lamellipodia are one of the actin-dependent subcellular structures involved in cell migration and are mainly generated by the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-family verprolin homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) and the membrane remodeling I-BAR domain protein IRSp53. Focal adhesions are another actin-based structure that contains vinculin protein and are essential for cell migration. In contrast, microtubules are not thought to be directly related to actin filaments. The GAN was trained using images of actin filaments paired with WAVE2, vinculin, IRSp53, and microtubules. Then, the generated images of WAVE2, vinculin, and IRSp53 by the GAN showed high similarity to the real images of WAVE2, vinculin, and IRSp53, respectively. However, the microtubule images generated from actin filament images were inferior, corroborating that the microscopic images of actin filaments provide more information about actin-related protein localization. Collectively, this study suggests that the image translation by the GAN can predict the localization of functionally related proteins.",

    "abstract": "Cilia on neurons play critical roles in both the development and function of the central nervous system (CNS). While it remains challenging to elucidate the precise roles for neuronal cilia, it is clear that a subset of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) preferentially localize to the cilia membrane. Further, ciliary GPCR signaling has been implicated in regulating a variety of behaviors. Melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1), is a GPCR expressed centrally in rodents known to be enriched in cilia. Here we have used MCHR1 as a model ciliary GPCR to develop a strategy to fluorescently tag receptors expressed from the endogenous locus in vivo. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we inserted the coding sequence of the fluorescent protein mCherry into the N-terminus of Mchr1. Analysis of the fusion protein (mCherryMCHR1) revealed its localization to neuronal cilia in the CNS, across multiple developmental time points and in various regions of the adult brain. Our approach simultaneously produced fortuitous in/dels altering the Mchr1 start codon resulting in a new MCHR1 knockout line. Functional studies using electrophysiology show a significant alteration of synaptic strength in MCHR1 knockout mice. A reduction in strength is also detected in mice homozygous for the mCherry insertion, suggesting that while the strategy is useful for monitoring the receptor, activity could be altered. However, both lines should aid in studies of MCHR1 function and contribute to our understanding of MCHR1 signaling in the brain. Additionally, this approach could be expanded to aid in the study of other ciliary GPCRs.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections. Successful treatment is hampered by its remarkable ability to rapidly develop resistance to antimicrobial agents, mostly through mutation. In response, the World Health Organization listed carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa as a Priority 1 (Critical) pathogen for research and development of new treatments. A key resource in developing effective countermeasures is access to diverse and clinically relevant strains for testing. Herein we describe a panel of 100 diverse P. aeruginosa strains to support this endeavor.\n\nWhole genome sequencing was performed on 3,785 P. aeruginosa housed in our repository. Isolates were cultured from clinical samples collected from healthcare facilities around the world between 2003 and 2017. Core-genome multi-locus sequence typing and high-resolution SNP-based phylogenetic analyses were used to select a panel of 100 strains that captured the genetic diversity of this collection. Comprehensive antibiotic susceptibility testing was also performed using 14 clinically relevant antibiotics.\n\nThis 100-strain diversity panel contained representative strains from 91 different sequence-types, including genetically distinct isolates from major epidemic clones ST-111, ST-235, ST-244, and ST-253. Seventy-one distinct antibiotic susceptibility profiles were identified ranging from pan-sensitive to pan-resistant. Known resistance alleles as well as the most prevalent mutations underlying the antibiotic susceptibilities were characterized for all isolates.\n\nThis panel provides a diverse and comprehensive set of P. aeruginosa strains for use in developing solutions to antibiotic resistance. The isolates, and all available meta-data including genome sequences, are available to industry, academic institutions, federal and other laboratories at no additional cost.\n\nImportancePseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most important human pathogens and a leading target in the development of new drugs and therapeutics. This species displays a remarkable level of diversity and any potential therapeutic must contend with this characteristic to ensure it retains efficacy across different strains. To date, only limited panels of P. aeruginosa are available for testing, and none have been designed to capture the genetic diversity of the species. The panel described herein has been designed to address this shortcoming by providing a set of 100 distinct strains that greatly captures the diversity of the species. This panel will be of significant value to research groups working on this important pathogen, both for research purposes and in the development of new diagnostics and countermeasures.",

An increasing body of evidence shows that CYP46A1 activation is able to reduce Alzheimers Disease (AD) pathological processes. In this study we report for the first time that CYP46A1 overexpression and increase of 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24OH) induces sex-specific changes in synaptic functions in aged mice, being beneficial in females while detrimental in males. The positive effects on cognition in aged CYP46A1 overexpressing female mice were accompanied by morphological changes in dendritic spines and enhancement of estrogen receptor signaling in hippocampus. In aged males, CYP46A1 overexpression leads to anxiety-like behavior and worsening of spatial memory, followed by decreased dendritic spine density and higher 5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels in hippocampus. Further, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD, mild cognitive impairment and healthy patients revealed that 24OH was negatively associated to markers of neurodegeneration in women but not in men. Based on our results, CYP46A1 activation may represent a pharmacological target that could specifically enhance brain estrogen receptor signaling in women at risk of developing AD. Finally, this study highlights the importance of taking into account the sex-dimension in both preclinical and clinical studies of neurodegenerative diseases like AD.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescent non-canonical amino acids (fNCAAs) could serve as starting points for the rational design of protein-based fluorescent sensors of biological activity. However, efforts toward this goal are likely hampered by a lack of atomic-level characterization of fNCAAs within proteins. Here, we describe the spectroscopic and structural characterization of five streptavidin mutants that contain the fNCAA L-(7-hydroxycoumarin-4-yl)ethylglycine (7-HCAA) at sites proximal to the binding site of its substrate, biotin. Many of the mutants exhibited altered fluorescence spectra in response to biotin binding, which included both increases and decreases in fluorescence intensity as well as red or blue shifted emission maxima. Structural data were also obtained for three of the five mutants. The crystal structures shed light on interactions between 7-HCAA and functional groups--contributed either by the protein or substrate--that may be responsible for the observed changes in the 7-HCAA spectra. These data could be used in future studies aimed at the rational design of fluorescent, protein-based sensors of small molecule binding or dissociation.",

    "abstract": "The sequence space accessible to evolving proteins can be enhanced by cellular chaperones that assist biophysically defective clients in navigating complex folding landscapes. It is also possible, however, for proteostasis mechanisms that promote strict quality control to greatly constrain accessible protein sequence space. Unfortunately, most efforts to understand how proteostasis mechanisms influence evolution rely on artificial inhibition or genetic knockdown of specific chaperones. The few experiments that perturb quality control pathways also generally modulate the levels of only individual quality control factors. Here, we use chemical genetic strategies to tune proteostasis networks via natural stress response pathways that regulate levels of entire suites of chaperones and quality control mechanisms. Specifically, we upregulate the unfolded protein response (UPR) to test the hypothesis that the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis network shapes the sequence space accessible to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) envelope (Env) protein. Elucidating factors that enhance or constrain Env sequence space is critical because Env evolves extremely rapidly, yielding HIV strains with antibody and drug escape mutations. We find that UPR-mediated upregulation of ER proteostasis factors, particularly those controlled by the IRE1-XBP1s UPR arm, globally reduces Env mutational tolerance. Conserved, functionally important Env regions exhibit the largest decreases in mutational tolerance upon XBP1s activation. This phenomenon likely reflects strict quality control endowed by XBP1s-mediated remodeling of the ER proteostasis environment. Intriguingly and in contrast, specific regions of Env, including regions targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies, display enhanced mutational tolerance when XBP1s is activated, hinting at a role for host proteostasis network hijacking in potentiating antibody escape. These observations reveal a key function for proteostasis networks in decreasing instead of expanding the sequence space accessible to client proteins, while also demonstrating that the host ER proteostasis network profoundly shapes the mutational tolerance of Env in ways that could have important consequences for HIV adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates organize biochemistry in time and space, yet little is known about how cells control either the position or scale of these assemblies. In cells, condensates often appear as dispersed, relatively small assemblies that do not grow (coarsen) into a single droplet despite their propensity to coalesce. Here we report that ribonucleoprotein condensates of the Q-rich protein Whi3 interact with the endoplasmic reticulum, prompting us to hypothesize that membrane association controls the position and size of condensates. Reconstitution of Whi3 condensates on supported lipid bilayers reveals that association with a diffusive lipid surface promotes condensation at both physiological ionic strength and protein concentration. Notably, these assemblies rapidly arrest, matching size distributions seen in cells. The timing of the arrest is influenced by the ordering of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and controlled by the slow diffusion of complexes induced by the membrane. This slowed diffusion limits both transfer of small protein-RNA complexes between condensates and their coalescence, thus driving coarsening to arrest. Our experiments reveal a tradeoff between locally-enhanced protein concentration at membranes, which favors condensation, and an accompanying reduction in diffusion, which restricts coarsening. Thus, membranes can maintain a population of small condensates in the absence of active mechanisms. Given that many condensates are bound to endomembranes, we predict that the biophysical properties of lipid bilayers are key for controlling condensate sizes throughout the cell.\n\nOne sentence summaryAssembly on a membrane surface positions and scales biomolecular condensates by controlling relative diffusion rates of proteins and nucleic acids.",

However, this cutaneous vessel has never been examined and evaluated as a potential candidate ex vivo model to study peripheral vascular diseases. This study aims to investigate vascular tone mediated through 2-adenergic receptor on rat tail vein under different temperatures.\n\nMethodsVasoconstriction stimulated by 2-adrenergic receptor selective agonists UK14304, guanabenz was thoroughly examined in isolated rat tail lateral vein. Susceptibility of cutaneous vessel to temperature changes was investigated under 37 {degrees}C and 28 {degrees}C. Differentiated vascular reactivity exhibited at different temperature was further explored with different 2-adrenergic receptor selective agonists and validated with antagonism by 1-adrenergic receptor and 2-adrenergic receptor selective antagonist prazosin and RX821002, respectively.\n\nResultsVascular tone of freshly isolated vein remained same compared with that of stored in pre-gassed physiologic buffer at 4 {degrees}C overnight. Presence of endothelium and repeated administration of UK14304 did not alter contractile property. Vessels away from torso (distal) showed significantly different contractile character compared with portion close to torso (proximal) at 28 {degrees}C but kept uniform at 37 {degrees}C. Enhanced vasoconstriction along with increased potency of 2-adrenergic receptor agonists UK14304 and guanabenz was consistently present at 28 {degrees}C, independent of temperature change orders. Potentiated vasoconstriction present at 28 {degrees}C was later proved via 2-adrenergic receptor alone.\n\nDiscussionHarvest and preparation of rat tail lateral vein was described in details. Contractile property of venous preparations stimulated by 2-adrenergic receptor selective agonists was first time examined. Differentiated vasoconstriction at moderate cooling temperature was described and confirmed to through 2-adrenergic receptor activation.

Here we present the first developmental and intergenerational landscape of the human circulatory lipidome, derived by profiling of 480 lipid species representing 25 lipid classes, in mothers and their offspring (n=2491). Levels of 66% of the profiled lipids increased in maternal circulation during gestation, while cord blood had higher concentrations of acylcarnitines and lysophospholipids. The offspring lipidome at age six years revealed striking similarities with postnatal maternal lipidome (adult) in its lipid composition and concentrations. Comparison of lipids associated with child and maternal adiposity identified a 92% overlap, implying intergenerational similarities in the lipid signatures of obesity risk.

    "abstract": "The brain must extract behaviorally relevant latent variables from the signals streamed by the sensory organs. Such latent variables are often encoded in the dynamics that generated the signal rather than in the specific realization of the waveform. Therefore, one problem faced by the brain is to segment time series based on underlying dynamics. We present two algorithms for performing this segmentation task that are biologically plausible, which we define as acting in a streaming setting and all learning rules being local. One algorithm is model-based and can be derived from an optimization problem involving a mixture of autoregressive processes. This algorithm relies on feedback in the form of a prediction error, and can also be used for forecasting future samples. In some brain regions, such as the retina, the feedback connections necessary to use the prediction error for learning are absent. For this case, we propose a second, model-free algorithm that uses a running estimate of the autocorrelation structure of the signal to perform the segmentation. We show that both algorithms do well when tasked with segmenting signals drawn from autoregressive models with piecewise-constant parameters. In particular, the segmentation accuracy is similar to that obtained from oracle-like methods in which the ground-truth parameters of the autoregressive models are known. We also test our methods on datasets generated by alternating snippets of voice recordings. We provide implementations of our algorithms at https://github.com/ttesileanu/bio-time-series.",

Detection of GPCR dimers in native tissues has however been challenging due to the lack of suitable tools. - and {delta}-Opioid receptors (MORs and DORs) co-expressed in transfected cells has been reported to form heterodimers. The co-localization of MORs and DORs in neurons has been studied in knock-in mice expressing genetically engineered receptors fused to fluorescent proteins. Here we report that single cholinergic neurons in the mouse striatum endogenously express both MORs and DORs. The receptors were fluorescently labeled in live brain slices with a ligand-directed labeling reagent, NAI-A594. The selective activation of MORs and DORs, with DAMGO (-agonist) and deltorphin ({delta}-agonist) inhibited spontaneous firing in all cells examined. In the continued presence of agonist, the firing rate returned to baseline with the application of deltorphin but was persistently inhibited with the application of DAMGO. In addition, agonist-induced internalization of DORs but not MORs was detected. When MORs and DORs were activated simultaneously with [Met5]enkephalin, desensitization of MORs was facilitated but internalization was not increased. Together, these results indicate that while MORs and DORs are expressed in single striatal cholinergic interneurons, the two receptors function independently.",

Social stress-induced neurovascular pathology is associated with depressive symptoms in male mice however it remains unknown if it contributes to this sexual dimorphism. Here, we report that chronic social and subchronic variable stress promoted sex-specific blood-brain barrier (BBB) molecular and morphological alterations in mood-related brain regions. Viral-mediated functional manipulation leading to a targeted disruption of the BBB induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors including social avoidance and anhedonia. Endothelium cell-specific transcriptomic profiling revealed key pathways and novel genes involved in maladaptive stress responses vs resilience. We also confirmed BBB leakiness in the brain of stressed females which led us to explore and identify circulating vascular biomarkers of chronic stress that could inform on diagnosis and treatment. Importantly, these pre-clinical findings were validated in human blood and postmortem brain samples from depressed women, thus highlighting their translational value. By revealing a sex-specific causal role of BBB dysfunction in stress responses and depression, our results implicate vascular impairment as a major factor underlying mood disorders.",

    "abstract": "Functional interactions between G protein-coupled receptors are poised to enhance neuronal sensitivity to neuromodulators and therapeutic drugs. Mu and Delta opioid receptors (MORs and DORs) can interact when overexpressed in the same cells, but whether co-expression of endogenous MORs and DORs in neurons leads to functional interactions is unclear. Here, we show that both MORs and DORs inhibit parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (PV-BCs) in hippocampal CA1 through partially occlusive signaling pathways that terminate on somato-dendritic potassium channels and presynaptic calcium channels. Using photoactivatable opioid neuropeptides, we find that DORs dominate the response to enkephalin in terms of both ligand-sensitivity and kinetics, which may be due to relatively low expression levels of MOR. Opioid-activated potassium channels do not show heterologous desensitization, indicating that MORs and DORs signal independently. In a direct test for heteromeric functional interactions, the DOR antagonist TIPP-Psi does not alter the kinetics or potency of either the potassium channel or synaptic responses to photorelease of the MOR agonist DAMGO. Thus, despite largely redundant and convergent signaling, MORs and DORs do not functionally interact in PV-BCs. These findings imply that crosstalk between MORs and DORs, either in the form of physical interactions or synergistic intracellular signaling, is not a preordained outcome of co-expression in neurons.",

    "abstract": "Senescent cells accumulate in aging tissues, and their elimination can favor healthy aging1-4. Therefore, therapeutic interventions targeting cellular senescence may be promising strategies for delaying or reversing a vast range of age-related diseases5. As cells of the immune system are responsible for senescent cell elimination6-11, a possible anti-aging and pro-healthspan treatment is the specific activation of the immune system to induce senescent cell clearance. However, whether this elimination is limited by an immune checkpoint leading to tolerance of senescence cells is currently unknown. Here, we show that cellular senescence, elicited by various stressors other than oncogenic activation, triggers immune escape toward natural killer (NK) cells, which may thus limit the use of anti-senescence immunotherapies. Moreover, using mass spectrometry, we reveal that senescent cells reshuffle their glycosphingosine composition, toward a marked increase in the ganglioside content, including the appearance of disialylated ganglioside GD3. This senescence associated GD3 overexpression results from transcriptional upregulation of the gene encoding the enzyme ST8SIA1, which is responsible for GD3 synthesis. The high level of GD3 leads to a strong immunosuppressive signal affecting NK cell-mediated immunosurveillance. In a mouse model of lung fibrosis, senescent cell-dependent NK cell immunosuppression is blunted by in vivo administration of anti-GD3 monoclonal antibodies leading to a clear anti-fibrotic effect. These results demonstrate that GD3 upregulation in senescent cells drives a switch from immune clearance toward immune tolerance of senescent cells. Therefore, we propose that GD3 level acts as a senescence-associated immune checkpoint (SIC) that regulates NK cell functions toward senescent cells. Thus, targeting GD3 with specific antibodies may be a promising strategy for the development of effective anti-senescence immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Managing and engineering activated sludge wastewater treatment microbiomes for low-energy nitrogen removal requires process control strategies to stop the oxidation of ammonium at nitrite. Our ability to out-select nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) from activated sludge is challenged by their metabolic and physiological diversity, warranting measurements of their in situ physiology and activity under selective growth pressures. Here, we examined the stability of nitrite oxidation in activated sludge during a press disturbance induced by treating a portion of return activated sludge with a sidestream flow containing free ammonia (FA) at 200 mg NH3-N/L. The nitrite accumulation ratio peaked at 42% by day 40 in the experimental bioreactor with the press disturbance, while it did not increase in the control bioreactor. A subsequent decrease in nitrite accumulation within the experimental bioreactor coincided with shifts in dominant Nitrospira 16S rRNA amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). We applied bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) coupled with fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to investigate changes in the translational activity of NOB populations throughout batch exposure to FA. BONCAT-FACS confirmed that the single Nitrospira ASV washed-out of the experimental bioreactor had reduced translational activity following exposure to FA, whereas the two Nitrospira ASVs that emerged after process acclimation were not impacted by FA. Thus, the coexistence of functionally degenerate and physiologically resistant Nitrospira populations provided resilience to the nitrite-oxidizing function during the press disturbance. These results highlight how BONCAT-FACS can resolve ecological niche differentiations within activated sludge and inform strategies to engineer and control microbiome function.\n\nImportanceNitrogen removal from activated sludge wastewater treatment systems is an energy-intensive process due to the large aeration requirement for nitrification. This energy footprint could be minimized with engineering control strategies that wash-out nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) to limit oxygen demands. However, NOB populations can have a high degree of physiological diversity, and it is currently difficult to decipher the behavior of individual taxa during applied selective pressures. Here, we utilized a new substrate analog probing approach to measure the activity of NOB at the cellular translational level in the face of an applied press disturbance to the activated sludge process. Substrate analog probing corroborated the time-series reactor sampling, showing that coexisting and functionally redundant Nitrospira provided resilience to the nitrite oxidation process. Taken together, these results highlight how substrate analog approaches can illuminate in situ ecophysiologies within shared niches, and can inform strategies to improve microbiome engineering and management.",

Risk factors were identified using a Bayesian regularisation approach.\n\nResultsOf 489 FQ-R human isolates, 255 were also 3rd generation cephalosporin-resistant (3GC-R), with strong genetic linkage between aac(6)Ib-cr and blaCTX-M-15. We identified possible farm-to-human sharing for pairs of ST744 and ST162 isolates, but core genome SNP distances (71 and 63, respectively) were smaller in pairs of ST744 and ST162 isolates from different farms (7 and 3 SNPs, respectively). Total farm fluoroquinolone use showed a positive association with the odds of isolating FQ-R E. coli while total dry cow therapy use showed a negative association.\n\nConclusionsThis work suggests that FQ-R E. coli found on dairy farms have a limited impact on community bacteriuria within the local human population, however, this appears greater than observed for 3GC-R E. coli when studied in parallel. Reducing fluoroquinolone use may reduce the on-farm prevalence of FQ-R E. coli, and this reduction may be greater when dry cow therapy is targeted to the ecology of resistant E. coli on the farm.",

    "abstract": "Certain infant eating behaviours are associated with adverse health outcomes such as obesity. While a diet consisting of infant formula has been linked to higher-risk eating behaviours and changes in the gut microbiome, little is known about what role the gut microbiome plays in mediating eating behaviours. Using 16S rRNA sequences extracted from 96 fecal samples collected from 58 infants, we identified a subset of bacterial taxa that were more abundant in formula-fed infants, primarily composed of the phylum Firmicutes. The presence of these taxa correlated with a lower drive to eat (i.e., lower food responsiveness). Furthermore, short-chain fatty acid production pathways were significantly more abundant in formula-fed infants, negatively correlated with food responsiveness, and positively associated with relative abundance of the Firmicutes subset. Our results suggest that higher abundances of Firmicutes in formula-fed infants may decrease their food responsiveness through short-chain fatty acid production in the first four months of life. Taken together, these findings suggest a potential role for the infants diet in impacting eating behaviour via changes to the gut microbiome, which may lead to the development of novel interventions for the prevention of childhood obesity.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-36(Il-36) is a member of the novel Il-1-like proin-flammatory cytokine family that is highly expressed in epithelial tissues and several myeloid-derived cell types. We have recently shown that CCAAT enhancer binding protein{beta} (C/EBP{beta}) binds specifically to an essential half cAMP response element (half-CRE)*C/EBP motif in the Il36A promoter to induce Il36A expression upon LPS stimulation. C/EBPs are transcription factors belonging to the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family of transcriptional regulators. C/EBP proteins can form homo- and heterodimers and regulate gene expression by binding to C/EBP specific recognition sequences and composite sites that can contain 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3'dinucleotides (CpG). CpG methylation of such elements has been shown to influence transcription factor binding and gene expression. Here we show that the half-CREoC/EBP element in the Il36A promoter is differentially methylated in the murine RAW264.7 macrophage cell line and in primary murine macrophages. By using electrophoretic mobility gel shift and fluorescence polarization assays we demonstrate that C/EBP{beta} binding to the half-CRE*C/EBP element in the Il36A promoter following LPS stimulation is insensitive to CpG methylation. Transfection assays also show that methylation of the CpG in the half-CRE*C/EBP element does not alter LPS-induced Il36A promoter activity. A direct comparison of Il36A mRNA copy numbers as well as the pro-Il-36 protein level in RAW264.7 and primary macrophages revealed similar amounts in both cell types. Taken together, our data suggest that C/EBP{beta} binding to the half-CRE*C/EBP element and C/EBP{beta} mediated gene activation occurs independently of the CpG methylation status of the target DNA sequence and underline the potential of C/EBP{beta} to recognize methylated as well as unmethylated binding sites.",

    "abstract": "The hookworm Ancylostoma caninum is the most prevalent nematode parasite of dogs. Recently, we confirmed multiple-drug resistance (MDR) in several A. caninum isolates to all anthelmintic drug classes approved for the treatment of hookworms in dogs in the United States (USA). Cases of MDR hookworms appear to be highly overrepresented in greyhounds, suggesting that the MDR worms evolved on racing greyhound farms/kennels. The aims of this study were to evaluate the range of drug-resistant phenotypes and genotypes of the A. caninum infecting greyhounds. Fecal samples from recently retired greyhounds originating from geographically diverse areas of the USA were acquired from two greyhound adoption kennels, one active greyhound racing kennel, and three veterinary practices that work with adoption kennels. Fecal egg counts (FECs) were performed on fecal samples from 219 greyhounds, and despite almost all the dogs having been treated with one or more anthelmintics in the previous two to four weeks, the mean FEC was 822.4 eggs per gram (EPG). Resistance to benzimidazoles and macrocyclic lactones were measured using the egg hatch assay (EHA) and the larval development assay (LDA) respectively. We performed 23 EHA and 22 LDA on either individual or pooled feces, representing 81 animals. Mean and median IC50 and IC95 values for the EHA were 5.3 uM, 3.6 uM, and 24.5 uM, 23.4 uM respectively. For the LDA, mean and median IC50 values were 749.8 nM, >1000 nM respectively. These values range from 62 to 68 times higher than those we measured in our susceptible laboratory isolates. Pre-treatment fecal samples could not be obtained, however, post-treatment samples representing 219 greyhounds were collected. For samples collected <10 days post-treatment with albendazole, moxidectin, or a combination of febantel-pyrantel-moxidectin, the mean FEC were 349, 333, and 835 EPG, respectively. Samples collected 10-21 days post-treatment with albendazole, moxidectin, or pyrantel, yielded mean FEC of 1874, 335, and 600 EPG, respectively. Samples collected >21 days post-treatment with albendazole or moxidectin yielded mean FEC of 1819 and 1117 EPG, respectively. We obtained DNA from hookworm eggs isolated from 70 fecal samples, comprised of 60 individual dogs and 10 pools from multiple dogs. Deep sequencing of the isotype 1 {beta}-tubulin gene revealed the presence of the F167Y (TTC>TAC) resistance polymorphism in 99% of these samples, with 69% having [&ge;]75% resistant allele frequency. No resistance-associated polymorphisms were seen at any of the other {beta}-tubulin codons previously reported as associated with benzimidazole resistance in Strongylid nematodes. These clinical, in vitro, and genetic data provide strong evidence that racing and recently retired greyhound dogs in the USA are infected with MDR A. caninum at very high levels in terms of both prevalence and infection intensity.",

    "abstract": "c-MYC (MYC) is a major driver of prostate cancer tumorigenesis and progression. Although MYC is overexpressed in both early and metastatic disease and associated with poor survival, its impact on prostate transcriptional reprogramming remains elusive. We demonstrate that MYC overexpression significantly diminishes the androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional program (the set of genes directly targeted by the AR protein) in luminal prostate cells without altering AR expression. Importantly, analyses of clinical specimens revealed that concurrent low AR and high MYC transcriptional programs accelerate prostate cancer progression toward a metastatic, castration-resistant disease. Data integration of single-cell transcriptomics together with ChIP-seq revealed an increased RNA polymerase II (Pol II) promoter-proximal pausing at AR-dependent genes following MYC overexpression without an accompanying deactivation of AR-bound enhancers. Altogether, our findings suggest that MYC overexpression antagonizes the canonical AR transcriptional program and contributes to prostate tumor initiation and progression by disrupting transcriptional pause release at AR-regulated genes.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEAR and MYC are key to prostate cancer etiology but our current understanding of their interplay is scarce. Here we show that the oncogenic transcription factor MYC can pause the transcriptional program of the master transcription factor in prostate cancer, AR, while turning on its own, even more lethal program.",

    "abstract": "Plant nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat domain proteins (NLRs) are immune sensors that specifically recognize pathogen effectors and induce immune responses. Designing artificial NLRs with new effector recognition specificities is a promising prospect for sustainable, knowledge-driven crop protection. However, such strategies are hampered by the complexity of NLR function. Here, we tested whether molecular engineering of the integrated decoy domain (ID) of an NLR could extend its recognition spectrum to a new effector. To this aim, we relied on the detailed molecular knowledge of the recognition of distinct Magnaporthe oryzae MAX (Magnaporthe AVRs and ToxB-like) effectors by the rice NLRs RGA5 and Pikp-1. For both NLRs, effector recognition involves physical binding to their HMA (Heavy Metal-Associated) IDs. However, AVR-PikD, the effector recognized by Pikp-1, binds to a completely different surface of the HMA domain compared to AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39, recognized by RGA5. By introducing into the HMA domain of RGA5 the residues of the Pikp-1 HMA domain involved in AVR-PikD binding, we created a high-affinity binding surface for this new effector. In the Nicotiana benthamiana heterologous system, RGA5 variants carrying this engineered binding surface still recognize AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39, but also perceive the new ligand, AVR-PikD, resulting in the activation of immune responses. Therefore, our study provides a proof of concept for the design of new effector recognition specificities in NLRs through molecular engineering of IDs. However, it pinpoints significant knowledge gaps that limit the full deployment of this NLR-ID engineering strategy and provides hypotheses for future research on this topic.",

    "abstract": "Rifampicin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase. Here we show that rifampicin treatment of Escherichia coli results in a 50% decrease in cell size due to a terminal cell division. This decrease is a consequence of inhibition of transcription as evidenced by an isogenic rifampicin-resistant strain. There is also a 50% decrease in total RNA due mostly to a 90% decrease in 23S and 16S rRNA levels. Control experiments showed this decrease is not an artifact of our RNA purification protocol and therefore due to degradation in vivo. Since chromosome replication continues after rifampicin treatment, ribonucleotides from rRNA degradation could be recycled for DNA synthesis. Rifampicin-induced rRNA degradation occurs under different growth conditions and in different strain backgrounds. However, rRNA degradation is never complete thus permitting the re-initiation of growth after removal of rifampicin. The orderly shutdown of growth under conditions where the induction of stress genes is blocked by rifampicin is noteworthy. Inhibition of protein synthesis by chloramphenicol resulted in a partial decrease in 23S and 16S rRNA levels whereas kasugamycin treatment had no effect. Analysis of temperature-sensitive mutant strains implicate RNase E, PNPase and RNase R in rifampicin-induced rRNA degradation. We cannot distinguish between a direct role for RNase E in rRNA degradation versus an indirect role involving a slowdown of mRNA degradation. Since mRNA and rRNA appear to be degraded by the same ribonucleases, competition by rRNA is likely to result in slower mRNA degradation rates in the presence of rifampicin than under normal growth conditions.",

Cell line misidentification can be mitigated by the use of genotyping protocols, which have been developed for human cell lines but are lacking for many important model species. Here we leverage the classical observation that transposable elements (TEs) proliferate in cultured Drosophila cells to demonstrate that genome-wide TE insertion profiles can reveal the identity and provenance of Drosophila cell lines. We identify multiple cases where TE profiles clarify the origin of Drosophila cell lines (Sg4, mbn2, and OSS_E) relative to published reports, and also provide evidence that insertions from only a subset of LTR retrotransposon families are necessary to mark Drosophila cell line identity. We also develop a new bioinformatics approach to detect TE insertions and estimate intra-sample allele frequencies in legacy whole-genome shotgun sequencing data (called ngs_te_mapper2), which revealed copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity as a mechanism shaping the unique TE profiles that identify Drosophila cell lines. Our work contributes to the general understanding of the forces impacting metazoan genomes as they evolve in cell culture and paves the way for high-throughput protocols that use TE insertions to authenticate cell lines in Drosophila and other organisms.",

However, extant research has focused on how humans segment and remember discrete events from continuous input, with far less attention given to how the structure of connections between events impacts memory. Here we conduct a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in which subjects watch and recall a series of realistic audiovisual narratives. By transforming narratives into networks of events, we demonstrate that more central events--those with stronger semantic or causal connections to other events--are better remembered. During encoding, central events evoke larger hippocampal event boundary responses associated with memory formation. During recall, high centrality is associated with stronger activation in cortical areas involved in episodic recollection, and more similar neural representations across individuals. Together, these results suggest that when humans encode and retrieve complex real-world experiences, the reliability and accessibility of memory representations is shaped by their location within a network of events.",

    "abstract": "Motor control requires precise temporal and spatial encoding across distinct motor centers that is refined through the repetition of learning. The coordination of circuit refinement across motor regions requires modulatory input to shape circuit activity. Here we identify a role for the basocortical cholinergic pathway in the acquisition of a coordinated motor skill in mice. Targeted depletion of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons results in significant impairments in training on the rotarod task of coordinated movement. Cholinergic neuromodulation is required during training sessions as chemogenetic inactivation of cholinergic neurons also impairs task acquisition. Rotarod learning drives coordinated refinement of corticostriatal neurons arising in both medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and motor cortex, and we have found that cholinergic input to both motor regions is required for task acquisition. Critically, the effects of cholinergic neuromodulation are restricted to the acquisition stage, as depletion of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons after learning does not affect task execution. Our results indicate a critical role for cholinergic neuromodulation of distant cortical motor centers during coordinated motor learning.",

    "abstract": "Neural oscillations are observed ubiquitously in the mammalian nervous system, and the benefits of oscillatory coding have been the topic of frequent analysis. Many prior studies focused on communication between populations which were already oscillating and sought to understand how these rhythms and overall communication interact. We take a contrary view here. In this paper, we focus on measuring the costs of translating from an aperiodic code to a rhythmic one. We study two models. The first is simulated independent populations of neurons subjected to a theta-band (6 Hz) pacemaker using Linear-Nonlinear Poisson (LNP) sampling. The second is a model of beta-gamma oscillations using biophysical neurons with self-organized dynamics. We measure benefits and costs in both models using information theory. In both models oscillations can only benefit communications by increasing spiking by specific amounts, in effect, correcting for \"undersampling\" of the stimulus. This is mechanistically similar to theories for how deep brain stimulation can enhance cognition and is consistent with older studies of gamma entrainment. Yet this trend was not universal. No one guiding principle of dynamics determines the cost of a translation in the models we studied. In our models to predict the benefits or costs of an oscillatory translation we need to understand the exacting physical details of the intrinsic connections, the population size, and the external drive.",

    "abstract": "The development of the cerebral cortex relies on the controlled division of neural stem and progenitor cells. The requirement for precise spatiotemporal control of proliferation and cell fate places a high demand on the cell division machinery, and defective cell division can cause microcephaly and other brain malformations. Cell-extrinsic and intrinsic factors govern the capacity of cortical progenitors to produce large numbers of neurons and glia within a short developmental time window. In particular, ion channels shape the intrinsic biophysical properties of precursor cells and neurons and control their membrane potential throughout the cell cycle. We found that hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation (HCN)-channel subunits are expressed in mouse, rat, and human neural progenitors. Loss of HCN-channel function in rat neural stem cells impaired their proliferation by affecting the cell-cycle progression, causing G1 accumulation and dysregulation of genes associated with human microcephaly. Transgene-mediated, dominant-negative loss of HCN-channel function in the embryonic mouse telencephalon resulted in pronounced microcephaly. Together, our findings suggest a novel role for HCN-channel subunits as a part of a general mechanism influencing cortical development in mammals.\n\nSignificance StatementImpaired cell cycle regulation of neural stem and progenitor cells can affect cortical development and cause microcephaly. During cell cycle progression, the cellular membrane potential changes through the activity of ion channels and tends to be more depolarized in proliferating cells. HCN channels, which mediate a depolarizing current in neurons and cardiac cells, are linked to neurodevelopmental diseases, also contribute to the control of cell-cycle progression and proliferation of neuronal precursor cells. In this study, HCN-channel deficiency during embryonic and fetal brain development resulted in marked microcephaly of mice designed to be deficient in HCN-channel function in dorsal forebrain progenitors. The findings suggest that HCN-channel subunits are part of a general mechanism influencing cortical development in mammals.",
