    "abstract": "Plankton seascape genomics show different trends from large-scale weak differentiation to micro-scale structures. Prior studies underlined the influence of environment and seascape on a few single species differentiation and adaptation. However, these works generally focused on few single species, sparse molecular markers, or local scales. Here, we investigate the genomic differentiation of plankton at macro-scale in a holistic approach using Tara Oceans metagenomic data together with a reference-free computational method to reconstruct the FST-based genomic differentiation of 113 marine planktonic species using metavariant species (MVS). These MVSs, modelling the species only by their polymorphism, include a wide range of taxonomic groups comprising notably 46 Maxillopoda/Copepoda, 24 Bacteria, 5 Dinoflagellates, 4 Haptophytes, 3 Cnidarians, 3 Mamiellales, 2 Ciliates, 1 Collodaria, 1 Echinoidea, 1 Pelagomonadaceae, 1 Cryptophyta and 1 Virus. The analyses showed that differentiation between populations was significantly lower within basins and higher in bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes compared to zooplantkon. By partitioning the variance of pairwise-FSTmatrices, we found that the main drivers of genomic differentiation were Lagrangian travel time, salinity and temperature. Furthermore, we classified MVSs into parameter-driven groups and showed that taxonomy poorly determines which environmental factor drives genomic differentiation. This holistic approach of plankton genomic differentiation for large geographic scales, a wide range of taxa and different oceanic basins, offers a systematic framework to analyse population genomics of non-model and undocumented marine organisms.",

    "abstract": "Microsatellite expansions of CCTG repeats in the CNBP gene leads to accumulation of toxic RNA and have been associated to DM2. However, it is still unclear whether the dystrophic phenotype is also linked to CNBP decrease, a conserved CCHC-type zinc finger RNA binding protein that regulates translation and is required for mammalian development.\n\nHere we show that depletion of Drosophila CNBP in muscles causes age-dependent locomotor defects that are correlated with impaired polyamine metabolism. We demonstrate that the levels of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and polyamines are significantly reduced upon dCNBP depletion. Of note, we show a reduction of the CNBP-polyamine axis in muscle from DM2 patients. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that dCNBP controls polyamine metabolism through binding dOdc mRNA and regulating its translation. Remarkably, the locomotor defect of dCNBP-deficient flies is rescued by either polyamine supplementation or dOdc1 overexpression. We suggest that this dCNBP function is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates with relevant implications for CNBP-related pathophysiological conditions.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=195 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/441910v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a8c31corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a18260org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@76a3d4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fdd041_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG CNBP controls muscle function by regulating the polyamine metabolism\n\nO_LILack of dCNBP impairs locomotor function through ODC-polyamine downregulation\nC_LIO_LIdCNBP binds dOdc mRNA and regulates its translation\nC_LIO_LIPolyamine supplementation or dOdc1 reconstitution rescues locomotor defects\nC_LIO_LICNBP-ODC-polyamine levels are reduced in muscle of DM2 patients\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cyclodextrins are a class of molecules which inclusion complexes with small hydrophobic drugs, and has historically been used to improve solubility and bioavailability of labile drugs in pharmaceutical applications. More recently, polymerized cyclodextrin has been applied in various applications as implantable drug delivery depots and as medical device coatings (e.g. polymeric hernia meshes) due to their ability to sustain and control drug delivery as well as prevent biofouling. Cyclodextrin polymers as coatings for metal medical devices, like screws or stents, is less explored; due to the high mechanical property mismatch between polymers and metals, a polymer coating is liable to delaminate easily, especially during device deformation. Novel methods for facilitating attachment to metal substrates have been explored, but coating longevity is still an issue, and these methods typically require the use of multiple reagents and complex methods. We report here the development and characterization of a cyclodextrin polymer with a chelator-based crosslinker with respect to appearance, chemistry, drug release profiles, erosion, pH-dependence. We found that increasing the crosslinking ratio (crosslinker:cyclodextrin) slowed down degradation and decreased drug loading as well. Drug release of the anti-restenotic drug sirolimus proceeded for over 4 weeks. The ability of the polymer to stably coat metal stents was verified, and the coating procedure is a simple, single step protocol.",

    "abstract": "Self-initiated movements are known to be preceded by the readiness potential or RP, a gradual increase in surface-negativity of cortical potentials that can begin up to 1 second or more before movement onset. The RP has been extensively studied for decades, and yet we still lack a clear understanding of its functional role. Attempts to model the RP as an accumulation-to-bound process suggest that this signal is a by-product of time-locking to crests in neural noise rather than the outcome of a pre-conscious decision to initiate a movement. One parameter of the model accounts for the imperative to move now, with cued movements having a strong imperative and purely spontaneous movements having no imperative. Two different variants of the model have been proposed, and both predict a decrease in the (negative) amplitude of the early RP as the imperative grows stronger. In order to test this empirically, we conducted an experiment where subjects produced self-initiated movements under varying levels of time pressure, and we investigated the amplitude, shape, and latency of the RP as a function of the imperative to move, operationalised as a time limit. We identified distinct changes in the amplitude of the early RP that grew non-linearly as the time limit grew shorter. Thus these data did not support the prediction made by the model. In addition, our results confirm that the shape of the RP is not stereotypically negative, being either positive or absent in about half of the subjects.",

    "abstract": "How do neuronal subtypes emerge during development? Recent molecular studies have expanded our knowledge of existing neuronal diversity. However, the genesis of neuronal subtypes remains elusive and previous studies have been limited by a lack of quantitative methods for simultaneous detection of subtype diversity in situ. The bipolar interneurons of the mammalian retina represent a diverse neuronal class, characterized by distinct functions, morphologies, and recently discovered transcriptional profiles. Here, we developed a comprehensive spatiotemporal map of bipolar subtype genesis in the retina. Combining multiplexed detection of 16 RNA markers with timed delivery of EdU and BrdU, we analyzed more than 30,000 single cells in full retinal sections to classify all bipolar subtypes and their birthdates. We found that bipolar subtype birthdates are ordered and follow a centrifugal developmental axis. Spatial analysis revealed a striking oscillatory wave pattern of bipolar subtype birthdates, and lineage analyses suggest clonal restriction on homotypic subtype production. These results inspired a hierarchical model of neuronal subtype genesis in the mammalian retina, with the wave pattern of subtype birthdates arising from early asymmetric cell divisions among founding retinal progenitor cells. Our results provide an outline of the developmental logic that generates diverse neuronal subtypes, and establishes a framework for studying subtype diversification.",

    "abstract": "Aedes aegypti is a major vector of arboviruses that cause dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika. Although recent success in reverse genetics has facilitated rapid progress in basic and applied research, integration of forward genetics with modern technologies remains challenging in this important species, as up-to-47% of its chromosome is refractory to genetic mapping due to extremely low rate of recombination. Here we report the development of a marker-assisted-mapping (MAM) strategy to readily screen for and genotype only the rare but informative recombinants, drastically increasing both the resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Using MAM, we mapped a transgene that was inserted in a >100 Mb recombination desert and a sex-linked spontaneous red-eye (re) mutation just outside the region. We subsequently determined, by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout, that cardinal is the causal gene of re, which is the first forward genetic identification of a causal gene in Ae. aegypti. This study provides the molecular foundation for using gene-editing to develop versatile and stable genetic sexing methods by improving upon the current re-based genetic sexing strains. MAM does not require densely populated markers and can be readily applied throughout the genome to facilitate the mapping of genes responsible for insecticide- and viral-resistance. By enabling effective forward genetic analysis, MAM bridges a significant gap in establishing Ae. aegypti as a model system for research in vector biology. As large regions of suppressed recombination are also common in other plant and animal species including those of economic significance, MAM will have broad applications beyond vector biology.",

    "abstract": "Evidence of whole-genome duplications (WGDs) and subsequent karyotype changes has been detected in most major lineages of life on Earth. To clarify the complex resulting multiple-layered patterns of gene collinearity in genome analyses there is a need for convenient and accurate toolkits. To meet this need, we introduce here WGDI (Whole-Genome Duplication Integrated analysis), a Python-based command-line tool that facilitates comprehensive analysis of recursive polyploidizations and cross-species genome alignments. WGDI supports three main workflows (polyploid inference, hierarchical inference of genomic homology, and ancestral chromosomal karyotyping) that can improve detection of WGD and characterization of related events. It incorporates a more sensitive and accurate collinearity detection algorithm than previous softwares, and can accelerate WGD-related karyotype research. As a freely available toolkit at GitHub (https://github.com/SunPengChuan/wgdi), WGDI outperforms similar tools in terms of efficiency, flexibility and scalability. In an illustrative example of its application, WGDI convincingly clarified karyotype evolution in Aquilegia coerulea and Vitis vinifera following WGDs and rejected the hypothesis that Aquilegia contributed as a parental lineage to the allopolyploid origin of core dicots.",

    "abstract": "In this work, the unsupervised volumetric semantic segmentation of the plasma membrane of HeLa cells as observed with Serial Block Face Scanning Electron Microscopy is described. The resin background of the images was segmented at different slices of a 3D stack of 518 slices with 8, 192 x 8, 192 pixels each. The background was used to create a distance map which helped identify and rank the cells by their size at each slice. The centroids of the cells detected at different slices were linked to identify them as a single cell that spanned a number of slices. A subset of these cells, i.e., largest ones and those not close to the edges were selected for further processing. The selected cells were then automatically cropped to smaller regions of interest of 2, 000 x 2, 000 x 300 voxels that were treated as cell instances. Then, for each of these volumes the nucleus was segmented and the cell was separated from any neighbouring cells through a series of traditional image processing steps that followed the plasma membrane. The segmentation process was repeated for all the regions selected. For one cell for which the ground truth was available, the algorithm provided excellent results in Accuracy (AC) and Jaccard Index (JI): Nucleus: JI = 0.9665, AC= 0.9975, Cell and Nucleus JI = 0.8711, AC = 0.9655, Cell only JI = 0.8094, AC = 0.9629. A limitation of the algorithm for the plasma membrane segmentation was the presence of background, as in cases of tightly packed cells. When tested for these conditions, the segmentation of the nuclear envelope was still possible. All the code and data are released openly through GitHub, Zenodo and EMPIAR.",

Thus, this process is essential for sexual reproduction and human fertility. Germ cells depend on signals from the somatic gonad to determine their sex, but in organisms such as flies, mice and humans, the sex chromosome genotype of the germ cells is also important for germline sexual development. How somatic signals and germ cell-intrinsic cues act together to regulate germline sex determination is a key question about which little is known. We have found that JAK/STAT signaling in the GSC niche promotes male identity in germ cells and GSCs, in part by activating expression of the epigenetic reader Phf7. We have also found that JAK/STAT signaling is blocked in XX (female) germ cells through the intrinsic action of the sex determination gene Sex lethal, which preserves female identity. Thus, an important function of germline sexual identity is to control how GSCs respond to signals in their niche environment.",

However, there is a growing need for metabolic rate measurements suitable for developmental studies, particularly in Danio rerio, where many important developmental stages occur at < 4 mm. While many metabolic studies rely on respirometry, the cost and complexity of the equipment limits its appeal in non-specialist labs, and background respiration becomes increasingly problematic as the size of the organism reduces. Here, glucose uptake was compared to stop-flow respirometry as an alternative measure of metabolic rate more suitable to the small scale required for developmental studies. A Passing-Bablok regression revealed the rate of glucose uptake can be considered equivalent to oxygen consumption as a measure of metabolic rate in Danio rerio larvae within a 95% limit of agreement. Therefore, glucose uptake is a valid alternative to the gold-standard in small organisms where conventional respirometry is problematic.\n\nSummary statementThe rate of glucose uptake is a valid alternative to respirometry for metabolic rate measurements in small larval fish.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that nanoorganization of proteins within synapses may control the strength of communication between neurons in the brain. The unique subsynaptic distribution of glutamate receptors, which cluster in nanoalignment with presynaptic sites of glutamate release, supports this idea. However, testing it has been difficult because mechanisms controlling subsynaptic organization remain unknown. Reasoning that transcellular interactions could position AMPA receptors, we targeted a key transsynaptic adhesion molecule implicated in controlling AMPAR number, LRRTM2, using engineered, rapid proteolysis. Severing the LRRTM2 extracellular domain led quickly to nanoscale de-clustering of AMPARs away from release sites, not prompting their escape from synapses until much later. This rapid remodeling of AMPAR position produced significant deficits in evoked, but not spontaneous, postsynaptic receptor activation. These results dissociate receptor numbers from their nanopositioning in determination of synaptic function, and support the novel concept that adhesion molecules acutely position AMPA receptors to dynamically control synaptic strength.",

While the transcriptional state of cells at the beginning or at the end of these trajectories are well described from bulk analysis, what happens in the intermediate states has remained elusive until the use of single cell approaches. Applying Shannon entropy to measure cell-to-cell variability among cells at the same stage of differentiation, we observed a transient peak of gene expression variability in all the hematopoietic differentiation pathways. Strikingly, genes with the highest entropy variation in a given differentiation pathway matched genes known as pathway-specific, whereas genes with the highest expression variation were common to all pathways. Finally, we showed that the level of cell-to-cell variation is increased in the most immature compartment of hematopoiesis in myelodysplastic syndromes. These data suggest that differentiation could be better conceptualized as a dynamical stochastic process with a transient stage of cellular indetermination.",

    "abstract": "Many canonical signaling pathways exhibit complex time-varying responses, yet how minutes-timescale pulses of signaling interact with the dynamics of transcription and gene expression remains poorly understood. Erk-induced immediate early gene (IEG) expression is a model of this interface, exemplifying both dynamic pathway activity and a rapid, potent transcriptional response. Here, we quantitatively characterize IEG expression downstream of dynamic Erk stimuli in individual cells. We find that IEG expression responds rapidly to acute changes in Erk activity, but only in a sub-population of stimulus-responsive cells. We find that while Erk activity partially predicts IEG expression, a majority of response heterogeneity is independent of Erk and can be rapidly tuned by different mitogenic stimuli and parallel signaling pathways. We extend our findings to an in vivo context, the mouse epidermis, where we observe heterogenous immediate-early gene accumulation in both fixed tissue and single-cell RNA-sequencing data. Our results demonstrate that signaling dynamics can be faithfully transmitted to gene expression and suggest that the signaling-responsive population is an important parameter for interpreting gene expression responses.",

    "abstract": "Telomerases elongate the ends of chromosomes required for cell immortality through their reverse transcriptase activity. By using the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae we defined the order in which the holoenzyme matures. First, a longer precursor of the telomerase RNA, TLC1 is transcribed and exported into the cytoplasm, where it associates with the protecting Sm-ring, the Est- and the Pop-proteins. This partly matured telomerase is re-import into the nucleus via Mtr10 and a novel TLC1-import factor, the karyopherin Cse1. Remarkably, while mutations in all known transport factors result in short telomere ends, mutation in CSE1 bypasses this defect and become Type I like survivors. Interestingly, both import receptors contact the Sm-ring for nuclear import, which therefore resembles a quality control step in the maturation process of the telomerase. The re-imported immature TLC1 is finally trimmed into the ~1150 nucleotide long mature form. TMG-capping of TLC1 finalizes maturation, leading to mature telomerase.",

    "abstract": "In the metazoan germline, Piwi proteins play an essential regulatory role in maintenance of stemness and self-renewal by piRNA-mediated repression of transposable elements. To date, the activity of Piwi proteins and the piRNA pathway in vertebrates was believed to be confined to the gonads. Our results reveal expression of Piwil1 in a vertebrate somatic cell type, the neural crest-a migratory embryonic stem cell population. We show that Piwil1 is expressed at low levels throughout chick neural crest development, peaking just before neural crest cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition to leave the neural tube and migrate into the periphery. Importantly, loss of Piwil1 impedes neural crest emigration. Small RNA sequencing reveals somatic piRNAs with sequence signatures of an active ping pong loop. Coupled with Piwil1 knockout RNA-seq, our data suggest that Piwil1 regulates expression of the transposon derived gene ERNI in the chick dorsal neural tube, which in turn suppresses Sox2 expression to precisely control the timing of neural crest specification and emigration. Our work provides mechanistic insight into a novel function of the piRNA pathway as a regulator of somatic development in vertebrates.",

We report here that, through [~]435 million years of evolution in jawed vertebrates, purifying selection has shaped motifs in the extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains of eutherian CD4 that both enhance pMHCII responses and are coevolving with residues in an intracellular motif that inhibits pMHCII responses. Importantly, while CD4 interactions with the Src kinase, Lck, are classically viewed as the key determinant of CD4s contribution to pMHCII responses, we found that without the inhibitory motif CD4-Lck interactions are not necessary for robust responses to pMHCII. In summary, motifs that mediate events on the outside and inside of CD4+ T cells coevolved to finetune the relay of pMHCII-specific information across the membrane. These results have implications for the evolution and function of complex transmembrane receptors and for biomimetic engineering.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the evolutionary relationship between immune cells and the blood-brain is important to devise therapeutic strategies that can regulate their critical function. In vertebrates, immune cells follow either a paracellular or transcellular pathway to infiltrate the BBB. In drosophila glial cells form the BBB that regulates the access of immune-like cells to the drosophila brain. However, it is still not known which route immune-like cells follow to infiltrate the drosophila brain. In vertebrates, paracellular migration is dependent on PECAM1, while transcellular migration is dependent on the expression of CAV1. Interestingly drosophila genome lacks both genes. Tre1 superfamily (Tre1, Moody, and Dmel_CG4313) play a diverse role in regulating transepithelial migration in drosophila. However, its evolutionary history and origin are not yet known. We performed phylogenetic analysis, together with HH search, positive selection, and ancestral reconstruction to investigate the Tre1 family Interestingly we found that Tre1 exists in mollusks, insects, ambulacria, and sclaidphora. Moody is shown to be a more ancient protein and it existed since cnidaria emergence and has a homolog (GPCR84) in mammals. The third family member (Dmel_CG4313) only exists in insects. The origin of the family seems to be related to the rhodopsin-like family and in particular family . We found that opsin is the nearest receptor to have a common ancestor with the Tre1 superfamily that seems to have diverged in sponges. We investigated the positive selection of the Tre1 family using PAML. Tre1 seems to have evolved under negative selection, whereas Moody has evolved during positive selection. The sites that we found under positive selection are Likely to play a role in the speciation of function in the case of Moody. We have identified an SH3, in Tre1 and, moody and Dmel_CG4313. Sh3 is known to play a fundamental role in regulating actin movement in a Rho-dependent manner. We suggest that Tre1 could be playing an important role in paracellular diapedesis in drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Candida auris is an emerging healthcare-associated pathogen of global concern. Although this organism does not display the same morphological plasticity as the related fungal pathogen Candida albicans, recent reports have identified numerous C. auris isolates that grow in cellular aggregates or filaments. However, the genetic circuitry governing C. auris morphology remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we developed an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system to generate mutants exhibiting aggregating or filamentous cell morphologies. Aggregating strains were associated with disruption of homologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chitinase and chitin synthase regulatory proteins, including components of the Regulation of ACE2 Morphogenesis (RAM) pathway, while disruption of a homolog of the S. cerevisiae ELM1 gene resulted in a novel filamentous strain of C. auris. To facilitate targeted genetic manipulation, we developed a transiently expressed Cas9 and sgRNA expression system for use in C. auris. Transformation using this system significantly increased the efficiency of homologous recombination and targeted integration of a reporter cassette in all four clades of C. auris. Using this system, we generated targeted deletion mutants to confirm the roles of RAM and Elm1 proteins in regulating C. auris morphogenesis. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of aggregating and filamentous morphogenesis in C. auris. Furthermore, the genetic manipulation tools described here will allow for inexpensive and efficient manipulation of the C. auris genome.\n\nImportanceCandida auris is an emerging and often multi-drug resistant fungal pathogen responsible for outbreaks globally. Current difficulties in performing genetic manipulation in this organism remain a barrier to understanding C. auris biology. Homologous recombination approaches can result in less than 1% targeted integration of a reporter cassette, emphasizing the need for new genetic tools specific for manipulating C. auris. Here, we adapted Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and a transient Cas9 and sgRNA expression system for use in forward and reverse genetic manipulation of C. auris. We demonstrated the efficacy of each system by uncovering genes underlying cellular morphogenesis in C. auris. We identified a novel filamentous mutant of C. auris, demonstrating that this organism has maintained the capacity for filamentous growth. Our findings provide additional options for improving the genetic tractability of C. auris, which will allow for further characterization of this emerging pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Empathy for pain engages both shared affective responses and self-other distinction. In this study, we addressed the highly debated question of whether neural responses previously linked to affect sharing could result from the perception of salient affective displays. Moreover, we investigated how affect sharing and self-other distinction interact to determine our response to a pain that is either perceived as genuine or pretended (while in fact both were acted for reasons of experimental control). We found stronger activations in regions associated with affect sharing (anterior insula, aIns, and anterior mid-cingulate cortex, aMCC) as well as with affective self-other distinction (right supramarginal gyrus, rSMG), in participants watching video clips of genuine vs. pretended facial expressions of pain. Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM), we then assessed the neural dynamics between the right aIns and rSMG in these two conditions. This revealed a reduced inhibitory effect on the aIns to rSMG connection for genuine compared to pretended pain. For genuine pain only, brain-to-behavior regression analyses highlighted a linkage between this inhibitory effect on the one hand, and pain ratings as well as empathic traits on the other. These findings imply that if the pain of others is genuine and thus calls for an appropriate empathic response, neural responses in the aIns indeed seem related to affect sharing and self-other distinction is engaged to avoid empathic over-arousal. In contrast, if others merely pretend to be in pain, the perceptual salience of their painful expression results in neural responses that are down-regulated to avoid inappropriate affect sharing and social support.",

    "abstract": "Mutations of the mitochondrial DNA are an important cause of inherited diseases that can severely affect the tissues homeostasis and integrity. The m.3243A>G mutation is the most commonly observed across mitochondrial disorders and is linked to multisystemic complications, including cognitive deficits. In line with in vitro experiments demonstrating the m.3243A>Gs negative impact on neuronal energy production and integrity, m.3243A>G patients show cerebral gray matter tissue changes. However, its impact on the most neuron-dense, and therefore energy-consuming brain structure - the cerebellum - remains elusive.\n\nIn this work, we used high resolution structural and functional data acquired using 7 Tesla MRI to characterize the neurodegenerative and functional signatures of the cerebellar cortex in m.3243A>G patients. Our results reveal altered tissue integrity within distinct clusters across the cerebellar cortex, apparent by their significantly reduced volume and longitudinal relaxation rate compared to healthy controls, indicating macroscopic atrophy and microstructural pathology. Spatial characterization reveals that these changes occur especially in regions related to the frontoparietal brain network that is involved in information processing and selective attention. In addition, based on resting-state fMRI data, these clusters exhibit reduced functional connectivity to frontal and parietal cortical regions, especially in patients characterized by (i) a severe disease phenotype and (ii) reduced information processing speed and attention control.\n\nCombined with our previous work, these results provide insight into the neuropathological changes and a solid base to guide longitudinal studies aimed to track disease progression.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNeoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is the usual treatment for locally-advanced breast cancer (BC). However, more than half of the patients lack an effective response to this treatment. Thus, its urgent to find predictive biomarkers. Recently, we proposed the HLA-DR expression level in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as a robust biomarker to select, in advance, patients that will actually benefit from NACT.\n\nPatients and MethodsA total of 202 BC patients, 102 of which submitted to NACT, were enrolled in this study. 61 biopsies and 41 blood samples collected pre-NACT and 100 non-NACT tumor samples were immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. Both NACT and non-NACT patients were followed up for 34 months. Blood-isolated immune cells were cultured with BC cell lines in a 3D system.\n\nResultsHere we confirmed that HLA-DR level in CTLs is a highly sensitive and specific biomarker to predict BC response to NACT, reflected in circulation and independent of the patients age, BC subtype and other tumor-immunological features. Therefore, we developed a predictive probability model, based on the determination of HLA-DR level in tumor-infiltrating CTLs, that could be used to guide therapeutic decisions. Interestingly, this biomarker was also associated with progression-free survival, regardless the treatment. Contrary to HLA-DRnegative CTLs, HLA-DR+ CTLs were able to reduce the viability of tumor cells, in culture, in agreement with their higher expression of activation, proliferation and cytotoxicity-related molecules. Tissue-residency and memory markers were also increased in HLA-DR+ CTLs. These anti-tumor features of HLA-DR+ CTLs may justify the clinical observations.\n\nConclusionHLA-DR level in CTLs is a validated and independent biomarker to predict response to NACT which allow the establishment of a clinical meaningful tool to select in advance patients that will truly benefit from this treatment. Intriguingly, it may be further used as a biomarker of BC patients general prognosis.\n\nHighlights- HLA-DR level in cytotoxic T cells is an independent predictive factor of breast cancer response to NACT\n- A predictive probability model based on this biomarker was developed as a new tool to improve treatment decisions\n- HLA-DR level in cytotoxic T cells is also reflected systemically\n- HLA-DR level in cytotoxic T cells is also a prognostic factor, associated with progression-free survival\n- HLA-DR+ cytotoxic T cells exhibit several phenotypic and functional anti-tumor characteristics",

    "abstract": "Despite increasing evidence indicating that invasive species are harming ecological systems and processes, impacts of multiple invasions, and the linkages between these events and changes in vegetation and soil are inadequately documented and remain poorly understood. Addressing multiple invasions would help to highlight high priority invaders and would aid in designing more effective control strategies, contributing to environmental restoration and sustainability. In this work, we tested the impact of three concurring invasive plant species, Amorpha fruticosa, Fraxinus pennsylvanica and Acer negundo, on soil conditions and native plant diversity. The research was conducted in riparian ecosystem and included the following treatments: (1) co-occurrence of the three invasive plant species, (2) occurrence of a single invasive species, and (3) control, i.e., absence of invasive species. Our findings revealed that the impact of invasive plants on soil properties and native plant diversity is magnified by their co-occurrence. Soil in mixed plots (those populated with all three invaders) contained much higher levels of nitrifying bacteria (NB), organic matter (Om), nitrogen (N), and carbon (C) as well as lower carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) levels, compared to single species invaded plots and control plots. Mixed plots were also characterized by reduced native plant diversity compared to single species invaded and control plots. Differences in soil conditions and native plant diversity revealed the interactive potential of invasive plants in depleting biodiversity, and thus in affecting ecological and biogeochemical processes. Our results highlight the need to study the impact of multispecies invasion and suggest that sites in riparian areas affected by co-occurring invaders, should be prioritized for ecosystem restoration.",

    "abstract": "We study local adaptation of a peripheral population by investigating the fate of new mutations using a haploid two-locus two-allele continent-island migration model. We explore how linkage, epistasis, and maladaptive gene flow affect the invasion probability of weakly beneficial de-novo mutations that arise on the island at an arbitrary physical distance to a locus that already maintains a stable migration-selection polymorphism. By assuming a slightly supercritical branching process, we deduce explicit conditions on the parameters that permit a positive invasion probability and we derive approximations for it. They show how the invasion probability depends on the additive and epistatic effects of the mutant, on its linkage to the polymorphism, and on the migration rate. We use these approximations together with empirically motivated distributions of epistatic effects to analyze the influence of epistasis on the expected invasion probability if mutants are drawn randomly from such a distribution and occur at a random physical distance to the existing polymorphism. We find that the invasion probability generally increases as the epistasis parameter increases or the migration rate decreases, but not necessarily as the recombination rate decreases. Finally, we shed light on the size of emerging genomic islands of divergence by exploring the size of the chromosomal neighborhood of the already established polymorphism in which 50% or 90% of the successfully invading mutations become established. These  window sizes always decrease in a reverse sigmoidal way with stronger migration and typically increase with increasing epistatic effect.",

We find that DNA methylation and Polycomb group repressors are both indispensable for autosomal imprinting, albeit at distinct gene sets. Moreover, the extraembryonic ectoderm relies on a broader spectrum of unique imprinting mechanisms, including non-canonical targeting of maternal endogenous retrovirus (ERV) driven promoters by G9a. We further utilize our data to identify Polycomb dependent and independent gene clusters on the imprinted X chromosome, which appears to reflect distinct domains of Xist-mediated suppression. Our data has allowed us to assemble a comprehensive inventory of the epigenetic mechanisms utilized in eutherian mammals to maintain parent-specific imprinting, including an expanded view of the placental lineage that comprises multiple unique pathways.",

We illustrate the power of this framework with four datasets varying in complexity, which we release to serve as a benchmark for future algorithm development.",

    "abstract": "To pursue a more mechanistic understanding of the neural control of behavior, many neuroethologists study animal behavior in controlled laboratory environments. One popular approach is to measure the movements of restrained animals while presenting controlled sensory stimulation. This approach is especially powerful when applied to genetic model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, where modern genetic tools enable unprecedented access to the nervous system for activity monitoring or targeted manipulation. While there is a long history of measuring the behavior of body- and head-fixed insects walking on an air-supported ball, the methods typically require complex setups with many custom components. Here we present a compact, simplified setup for these experiments that achieves high-performance at low cost.\n\nThe simplified setup combines existing hardware and software solutions with new component designs. We replaced expensive optomechanical and custom machined components with off-the-shelf and 3D-printed parts. We built the system around an inexpensive camera that achieves 180 Hz imaging and use an inexpensive tablet computer for presenting view-angle-corrected stimuli updated through a local network. We quantify the performance of the integrated system and characterize the visually guided behavior of flies in response to a range of visual stimuli. The improved system is thoroughly documented. This publication is accompanied by CAD files, parts lists, source code, and step-by-step instructions for setting up the system and analyzing behavioral data. We detail a complete ~$.300 system, including a cold-anesthesia tethering stage, that is ideal for hands-on teaching laboratories. This represents a nearly 50-fold cost reduction as compared to a typical system used in research laboratories, yet is fully featured and yields excellent performance.\n\nWe report the current state of this system, which started with a one-day teaching lab for which we built seven parallel setups and continues towards a setup in our lab for larger-scale analysis of visual-motor behavior in flies. Because of the simplicity, compactness, and low cost of this system, we believe that high-performance measurements of tethered insect behavior should now be widely accessible and suitable for integration into many systems. This access enables broad opportunities for comparative work across labs, species, and behavioral paradigms.",

    "abstract": "Split-belt treadmill training, common in stroke rehabilitation and motor learning experiments, reveals a mechanism through which energy can be extracted from the environment. People can extract net positive work from a split-belt treadmill by lengthening their step onto the fast belt. To understand how leg angles and belt speed differences affect energy transfer between the treadmill and the person during split-belt walking, we simulated a split-belt rimless wheel that alternates rotating on fast and slow treadmill belts. We found that the split-belt rimless wheel can passively walk steadily forward under a range of conditions, extracting enough energy from the treadmill to overcome losses during collisions. The simulated wheel can tolerate both speed disturbances and ground height variability, and it can even capture enough energy to walk uphill. We also built a physical split-belt rimless wheel robot, demonstrating the feasibility of energy extraction during split-belt treadmill walking. In comparing the wheel solutions to human split-belt gait, we found that humans do not maximize positive work performed by the treadmill; costs associated with balance and free vertical moments likely limit adaptation. This study characterizes the mechanics and energetics of split-belt walking, demonstrating that energy capture through intermittent contacts with the two belts is possible when the belt speed difference is paired with an asymmetry in leg angles at step-to-step transitions. This study demonstrates a novel way of harnessing energy through individual rotations rather than continuous contact and offers a simple model framework for understanding human choices during split-belt walking.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCopy-number variations (CNVs) have important clinical implications for several diseases and cancers. The clinically relevant CNVs are hard to detect because CNVs are common structural variations that define large parts of the normal human genome. CNV calling from short-read sequencing data has the potential to leverage available cohort studies and allow full genomic profiling in the clinic without the need for additional data modalities. Questions regarding performance of CNV calling tools for clinical use and suitable sequencing protocols remain poorly addressed, mainly because of the lack of good reference data sets.\n\nMethodsWe reviewed 50 popular CNV calling tools and included 11 tools for benchmarking in a unique reference cohort encompassing 39 whole genome sequencing (WGS) samples paired with analysis by the current clinical standard --SNP-array based CNV calling. Additionally, for nine of these samples we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) performed, in order to address the effect of sequencing protocol on CNV calling. Furthermore, we included Gold Standard reference sample NA12878, and tested 12 samples with CNVs confirmed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).\n\nResultsTool performance varied greatly in the number of called CNVs and bias for CNV lengths. Some tools had near-perfect recall of CNVs from arrays for some samples, but poor precision. Filtering output by CNV ranks from tools did not salvage precision. Several tools had better performance patterns for NA12878, and we hypothesize that this is the result of overfitting during the tool development.\n\nConclusionsWe suggest combining tools with the best recall: GATK gCNV, Lumpy, DELLY, and cn.MOPS. These tools also capture different CNVs. Further improvements in precision requires additional development of tools, reference data sets, and annotation of CNVs, potentially assisted by the use of background panels for filtering of frequently called variants.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional structure of chromosomes displays diverse patterns across the tree of life, with compartments, interaction domains and loops being quite universally observed. The archaeal kingdom remains understudied to this extent so far, despite representing an interesting area from evolutionary and other perspectives.\n\nHere we describe the spatial chromosomal organization of a hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Thermofilum adornatum strain 1910b based on high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (3C-seq) approach. The chromosome contact map showed a curved secondary diagonal almost orthogonal to the main one. No evidence of chromosome loops was present. We were able to identify boundaries of different strengths between chromosome interaction domains (CIDs) albeit moderate. The plaid-like patterns previously reported for Sulfolobus archaea were not observed. However, the calculation of A/B compartments divided the genome into 2 domains that were different by the density of predicted highly expressed genes and location of origins.\n\nFurther comparison of these domains with whole-genome gene expression profiles will allow to test whether these domains represent expression-associated compartments. If so, it is possible that they represent primitive compartments evolutionarily older than the plaid patterns of Sulfolobus and higher eukaryotes. Further exploration of 3D chromatin in all branches of archaeal diversity will elucidate the evolution of the links between structural and functional organization in live organisms.",

    "abstract": "MotivationIdentifying disease-related genes is important for the study of human complex diseases. Module structures or community structures are ubiquitous in biological networks. Although the modular nature of human diseases can provide useful insights, the mining of information hidden in multiscale module structures has received less attention in disease-gene prediction.\n\nResultsWe propose a hybrid method, HyMM, to predict disease-related genes more effectively by integrating the information from multiscale module structures. HyMM consists of three key steps: extraction of multiscale modules, gene rankings based on multiscale modules and integration of multiple gene rankings. The statistical analysis of multiscale modules extracted by three multiscale-module-decomposition algorithms (MO, AS and HC) shows that the functional consistency of the modules gradually improves as the resolution increases. This suggests the existence of different levels of functional relationships in the multiscale modules, which may help reveal disease-gene associations. We display the effectiveness of multiscale module information in the disease-gene prediction and confirm the excellent performance of HyMM by 5-fold cross-validation and independent test. Specifically, HyMM with MO can more effectively enhance the ability of disease-gene prediction; HyMM (MO, RWR) and HyMM (MO, RWRH) are especially preferred due to their excellent comprehensive performance, and HyMM (AS, RWRH) is also good choice due to its local performance. We anticipate that this work could provide useful insights for disease-module analysis and disease-gene prediction based on multi-scale module structures.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/xiangiu0208/HvMM\n\nContactlimin@mail.csu.edu.cn\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

In these assays, candidate sequences are cloned upstream or downstream of a reporter gene tagged by unique DNA sequences. However, tag sequences may themselves affect reporter gene expression and lead to major potential biases in the measured cis-regulatory activity. Here, we present a sequence-based method for correcting tag sequence-specific effects and demonstrate that our method can significantly reduce this source of variation, and improve the identification of functional regulatory variants by MPRAs. We also show that our model captures sequence features associated with post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA. Thus, this new method helps to not only improve detection of regulatory signals in MPRA experiments but also to design better MPRA protocols.",

    "abstract": "Long-term alcohol use results in behavioral deficits including impaired working memory, elevated anxiety, and blunted inhibitory control that are associated with prefrontal cortical (PFC) dysfunction. Preclinical observations demonstrate multiple impairments in GABAergic neurotransmission onto deep-layer principal cells (PCs) in prelimbic cortex that suggest dependence-related cortical dysfunction is the product of elevated excitability in these cells. Despite accumulating evidence showing alcohol-induced changes in interneuron signaling onto PCs differ between sexes, there is limited data explicitly evaluating sex-specific ethanol effects on excitatory signaling onto deep-layer PCs that may further contribute to deficits in PFC-dependent behaviors. To address this, we conducted electrophysiological and behavioral tests in both male and female Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate the effects of chronic ethanol exposure. Among our observations, we report a marked enhancement in glutamatergic signaling onto deep-layer PCs in male, but not female, rats after alcohol exposure. This phenomenon was furthermore specific to a sub-class of PC, sub-cortically projecting Type-A cells, and coincided with enhanced anxiety-like behavior, but no observable deficit in working memory. In contrast, female rats displayed an alcohol-induced facilitation in working memory performance with no change in expression of anxiety-like behavior. Together, these results suggest fundamental differences in alcohol effects on cell activity, cortical sub-circuits, and PFC-dependent behaviors across male and female rats.",

    "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3, also known as Machado Joseph disease) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of the trinucleotide repeat region within the ATXN3/MJD gene. Mutation of ATXN3 causes formation of ataxin-3 protein aggregates, neurodegeneration and motor deficits. Here we investigated the therapeutic potential and mechanistic activity of sodium butyrate (SB), the sodium salt of butyric acid, a metabolite naturally produced by gut microbiota, on cultured SH-SY5Y cells and transgenic zebrafish expressing human ataxin-3 containing 84 glutamine (Q) residues to model SCA3. SCA3 SH-SY5Y cells were found to contain ataxin-3 oligomeric species and protein aggregates. Treatment with SB increased activity of the autophagy protein quality control pathway in the SCA3 cells, decreased presence of ataxin-3 aggregates and presence of ataxin-3 oligomers in an autophagy-dependent manner. Treatment with SB was also beneficial in vivo, improving swimming performance, increasing activity of the autophagy pathway and decreasing presence of insoluble ataxin-3 protein species in the transgenic SCA3 zebrafish. Co-treating the SCA3 zebrafish with SB and chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, prevented the beneficial effects of SB on the zebrafish swimming, indicating that the improved swimming performance was autophagy-dependent. To understand the mechanism by which SB induces autophagy we performed proteomic analysis of protein lysates from the SB treated and untreated SCA3 SH-SY5Y cells. We found that SB treatment had increased activity of Protein Kinase A and AMPK signalling, with immunoblot analysis confirming that SB treatment had increased levels of AMPK protein and its substrates. Together our findings indicate that treatment with SB can increase activity of the autophagy pathway through a PKA/AMPK-dependent process and that this has beneficial effects in vitro and in vivo. We propose that treatment with sodium butyrate warrants further investigation as a potential treatment for neurodegenerative diseases underpinned by mechanisms relating to protein aggregation including SCA3.",

    "abstract": "The late gestational rise in glucocorticoids contributes to the structural and functional maturation of the perinatal heart. Here, we hypothesised that glucocorticoid action contributes to the metabolic switch in perinatal cardiomyocytes from carbohydrate to fatty acid oxidation. In primary mouse fetal cardiomyocytes, dexamethasone treatment induced expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and increased mitochondrial oxidation of palmitate, dependent upon glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Dexamethasone did not, however, induce mitophagy or alter the morphology of the mitochondrial network. In neonatal mice, dexamethasone treatment induced cardiac expression of fatty acid oxidation genes in vivo. However, dexamethasone treatment of pregnant C57Bl/6 mice at embryonic day (E)13.5 or E16.5 failed to induce fatty acid oxidation genes in fetal hearts assessed 24 hours later. Instead, at E17.5, fatty acid oxidation genes were down-regulated by dexamethasone, as was GR itself. PGC-1, required for glucocorticoid-induced maturation of primary mouse fetal cardiomyocytes in vitro, was down-regulated in vivo in fetal hearts at E17.5, 24 hours after dexamethasone administration. Similarly, following a course of antenatal corticosteroids in a sheep model of preterm birth, both GR and PGC-1 were down-regulated in fetal heart. These data suggest endogenous glucocorticoids support the perinatal switch to fatty acid oxidation in cardiomyocytes through changes in gene expression rather than gross changes in mitochondrial volume or mitochondrial turnover. Moreover, our data suggest that treatment with exogenous glucocorticoids may interfere with normal fetal heart maturation, possibly by down-regulating GR. This has implications for clinical use of antenatal corticosteroids when preterm birth is considered a possibility.",

    "abstract": "Targeted protein degradation is a powerful therapeutic modality that uses heterobifunctional small-molecules to induce proximity between E3 ubiquitin ligases and target proteins to ubiquitinate and degrade specific proteins of interest. However, many proteins are ubiquitinated and degraded to drive disease pathology; in these cases targeted protein stabilization (TPS), rather than degradation, of the actively degraded target using a small-molecule would be therapeutically beneficial. Here, we present the Deubiquitinase-Targeting Chimera (DUBTAC) platform for TPS of specific proteins. Using chemoproteomic approaches, we discovered the covalent ligand EN523 that targets a non-catalytic allosteric cysteine C23 in the K48 ubiquitin-specific deubiquitinase OTUB1. We then developed a heterobifunctional DUBTAC consisting of our EN523 OTUB1 recruiter linked to lumacaftor, a drug used to treat cystic fibrosis that binds {Delta}F508-CFTR. We demonstrated proof-of-concept of TPS by showing that this DUBTAC robustly stabilized {Delta}F508-CFTR in human cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells in an OTUB1-dependent manner.

    "abstract": "The fungal plasma membrane H+-ATPase Pma1 is a vital enzyme, generating a proton-motive force that drives the import of essential nutrients. Auto-inhibited Pma1 hexamers in starving fungi are activated by glucose signalling resulting in phosphorylation of the auto-inhibitory domain. As related P-type ATPases are not known to oligomerise, the physiological relevance of Pma1 hexamers remains unknown. We have determined the structure of hexameric Pma1 from Neurospora crassa by cryo-EM at 3.3 [A] resolution, elucidating the molecular basis for hexamer formation and auto-inhibition, and providing a basis for structure-based drug development. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations in a lipid bilayer suggest lipid-mediated contacts between monomers and a substantial protein-induced membrane deformation that could act as a proton-attracting funnel.",

    "abstract": "The lysyl oxidase family of enzymes (LOXs) catalyze oxidative deamination of lysine side chains on collagen and elastin to initialize cross-linking that is essential for the formation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Elevated expression of LOXs is highly associated with diverse disease processes. To date, the inability to detect total LOX catalytic function in situ has limited the ability to fully elucidate the role of LOXs in pathobiological mechanisms. Using LOXL2 as a representative member of the LOX family, we developed an in situ activity assay by utilizing the strong reaction between hydrazide and aldehyde to label the LOX-catalyzed allysine (-CHO) residues with biotin-hydrazide. The biotinylated ECM proteins are then labeled via biotin-streptavidin interaction and detected by fluorescence microscopy. This assay detects the total LOX activity in situ for both overexpressed and endogenous LOXs in cells and tissue samples and can be used for studies of LOXs as therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "MotivationMost genomes harbor a large number of transposons, and they play an important role in evolution and gene regulation. They are also of interest to clinicians as they are involved in several diseases, including cancer and neurodegeneration. Although several methods for transposon identification are available, they are often highly specialised towards specific tasks or classes of transposons, and they lack common standards such as a unified taxonomy scheme and output file format. Moreover, many methods are difficult to install, poorly documented, and difficult to reproduce.\n\nResultsWe present TransposonUltimate, a powerful bundle of three modules for transposon classification, annotation, and detection of transposition events. TransposonUltimate comes as a Conda package under the GPL-3.0 licence, is well documented and it is easy to install. We benchmark the classification module on the large TransposonDB covering over 891,051 sequences to demonstrate that it outperforms the currently best existing solutions. The annotation and detection modules combine sixteen existing softwares, and we illustrate its use by annotating Caenorhabditis elegans, Rhizophagus irregularis and Oryza sativa subs. japonica genomes. Finally, we use the detection module to discover 29,554 transposition events in the genomes of twenty wild type strains of Caenorhabditis elegans.\n\nAvailabilityRunning software and source code available on https://github.com/DerKevinRiehl/TransposonClassifierRFSB.

    "abstract": "Taxonomic classification of viruses is a multi-class hierarchical classification problem, as taxonomic ranks (e.g., order, family and genus) of viruses are hierarchically structured and have multiple classes in each rank. Classification of biological sequences which are hierarchically structured with multiple classes is challenging. Here we developed a machine learning architecture, VirusTaxo, using a multi-class hierarchical classification by k-mer enrichment. VirusTaxo classifies DNA and RNA viruses to their taxonomic ranks using genome sequence. To assign taxonomic ranks, VirusTaxo extracts k-mers from genome sequence and creates bag-of-k-mers for each class in a rank. VirusTaxo uses a top-down hierarchical classification approach and accurately assigns the order, family and genus of a virus from the genome sequence. The average accuracies of VirusTaxo for DNA viruses are 99% (order), 98% (family) and 95% (genus) and for RNA viruses 97% (order), 96% (family) and 82% (genus). VirusTaxo can be used to detect taxonomy of novel viruses using full length genome or contig sequences.\n\nAvailabilityOnline version of VirusTaxo is available at https://omics-lab.com/virustaxo/.",

    "abstract": "Biological systems show diversity in terms of the underlying network structure and the governing rules of such networks. Yet, different types of biological networks may develop similar adaptation strategies in face of environmental changes. Degeneracy refers to the ability to compensate for compromised function without the need for a redundant component in the system. Highly degenerate systems show resilience to perturbations and damage because the system can compensate for compromised function due to reconfiguration of the underlying network dynamics.\n\nAlthough formal definitions of degeneracy have been proposed, these definitions have only been tested in relatively simple networks involving weighted connections between network nodes. In this study, we test an information theoretic definition of degeneracy on random Boolean networks, frequently used to model gene regulatory networks. Random Boolean networks are discrete dynamical systems with binary connectivity and thus, these networks are well-suited for tracing information flow and the causal effects. By generating networks with random binary wiring diagrams, we test the effects of systematic lesioning of connections and perturbations of the network nodes on the degeneracy measure.\n\nOur analysis shows that degeneracy, on average, is the highest in networks in which ~20% of the connections are lesioned while 50% of the nodes are perturbed. Moreover, our results for the networks with no lesions and the fully-lesioned networks are comparable to the degeneracy measures from weighted networks, thus we show that the degeneracy measure is applicable to different networks. Such a generalized applicability implies that degeneracy can be used to make predictions about the variety of systems ability to recover function.\n\nAuthor SummaryDegeneracy - the ability of structurally different elements to perform similar functions - is a property of many biological systems. Systems exhibiting a high degree of degeneracy continue to exhibit the same macroscopic behavior following a lesion even though the underlying network dynamics are significantly different. Degeneracy thus suggests how biological systems can thrive despite changes to internal and external demands. Although degeneracy is a feature of network topologies and seems to be implicated in a wide variety of biological processes, research on degeneracy in biological networks is mostly limited to weighted networks (e.g., neural networks). To date, there has been no extensive investigation of information theoretic measures of degeneracy in other types of biological networks. In this paper, we apply existing approaches for quantifying degeneracy to random Boolean networks used for modeling biological gene regulatory networks. Using random Boolean networks with randomly generated rulesets to generate synthetic gene expression data sets, we systematically investigate the effect of network lesions on measures of degeneracy. Our results are comparable to measures of degeneracy using weighted networks, and this suggests that degeneracy measures may be a useful tool for investigating gene regulatory networks.",

We consider proteins representative of different topologies, from the simplest knot (trefoil 31), to the three-twist 52 knot, to the most complex stevedore, 61, knot. We harness the atomistic detail of the simulations to address aspects that have so far remained largely unexplored, such as sequence-dependent effects on the ruggedness of the landscape traversed during knot sliding. Our simulations reveal the combined effect on translocation of the knotted protein structure, i.e. backbone topology and geometry, and primary sequence, i.e. side chain size and interactions, and show that the latter can even dominate translocation hindrance. In addition, we observe that, due to the interplay between the knotted topology and intramolecular contacts, the transmission of tension along the peptide chain occurs very differently from homopolymers. Finally, by considering native and non-native interactions, we examine how the disruption or formation of such contacts can affect the translocation processivity and concomitantly create multiple unfolding pathways with very different activation barriers.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates are liquid-like membraneless compartments that contribute to the spatiotemporal organization of proteins, RNA, and other biomolecules inside cells. Some membraneless compartments, such as nucleoli, are dispersed as different condensates that do not grow beyond a certain size, or do not present coalescence over time. In this work, using a minimal protein model, we show that phase separation of binary mixtures of scaffolds and low-valency clients that can act as surfactants--i.e., that significantly reduce the droplet surface tension--can yield either a single drop or multiple droplets that conserve their sizes on long timescales (herein  multidroplet size-conserved), depending on the scaffold to client ratio. Our simulations demonstrate that protein connectivity and condensate surface tension regulate the balance between these two scenarios. Multidroplet size-conserved behavior spontaneously arises at increasing surfactant-to-scaffold concentrations, when the interfacial penalty for creating small liquid droplets is sufficiently reduced by the surfactant proteins that are preferentially located at the interface. In contrast, low surfactant-to-scaffold concentrations enable continuous growth and fusion of droplets without restrictions. Overall, our work proposes one potential thermodynamic mechanism to help rationalize how size-conserved coexisting condensates can persist inside cells--shedding light on the roles of general biomolecular features such as protein connectivity, binding affinity, and droplet composition in this process.",

Nonetheless, chemotherapy-associated adverse events can result in a patient terminating treatment. We show that transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC1) expression level predicts breast cancer sensitivity to doxorubicin (DOX) and pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapies.\n\nMethodsThe effects of PEMFs were examined with respect to: 1) the growth of MCF-7 cells in vitro; 2) MCF-7 tumors implanted into a chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model and; 3) patient-derived and MCF-7 breast cancer xenografts in mice.\n\nPotential synergisms between DOX and PEMF therapies were examined in these model systems and under conditions of TRPC1 overexpression or silencing in vitro.\n\nResultsPEMF exposure impaired the survival of MCF-7 cells, but not that of nonmalignant MCF10A breast cells. The effects of PEMF- and DOX-therapies synergized in vitro at compromising MCF-7 cell growth. Synergism could be corroborated in vivo with patient-derived xenograft mouse models, wherein PEMF exposure alone or in combination with DOX reduced tumor size. Stable overexpression of TRPC1 enhanced the vulnerability of MCF-7 cells to both DOX and PEMF exposure and promoted proliferation, whereas chronic DOX exposure reduced TRPC1 expression, induced chemoresistance, precluded response to PEMF exposure and mitigated proliferation. Markers of metastasis including SLUG, SNAIL, VIMENTIN, and E-CADHERIN as well as invasiveness were also positively correlated with TRPC1 channel expression.\n\nConclusionThe presented data supports a potential role of PEMF-therapy as an effective companion therapy to DOX-based chemotherapy for the treatment of breast cancers characterized by elevated TRPC1 expression levels.",

These copy number alterations contribute to cancer initiaition, progression and therapeutic resistance. Here, we present a conceptual framework for examining the patterns of copy number alterations in human cancer using whole-genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, and SNP6 microarray data making it widely applicable to diverse datasets. Deploying this framework to 9,873 cancers representing 33 human cancer types from the TCGA project revealed a set of 19 copy number signatures that explain the copy number patterns of 93% of TCGA samples. 15 copy number signatures were attributed to biological processes of whole-genome doubling, aneuploidy, loss of heterozygosity, homologous recombination deficiency, and chromothripsis. The aetiology of four copy number signatures are unexplained and some cancer types have unique patterns of amplicon signatures associated with extrachromosomal DNA, disease-specific survival, and gains of proto-oncogenes such as MDM2. In contrast to base-scale mutational signatures, no copy number signature associated with known cancer risk factors. The results provide a foundation for exploring patterns of copy number changes in cancer genomes and synthesise the global landscape of copy number alterations in human cancer by revealing a diversity of mutational processes giving rise to copy number changes.",

    "abstract": "Background/ObjectiveTight junctions (TJs) are essential for barrier integrity, inflammation, and cancer. The TJ protein Claudin-5 in the epithelia forms paracellular barriers and pores for permeability. Vitamin D and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) play important roles in various cancers. Although VDR and Claudin-5 are all involved in colorectal cancer (CRC), it remains unclear if they are closely related or function independently.\n\nDesignUsing the human CRC database, we explored the correlation between VDR and Claudin-5. We then investigated the VDR regulation of Claudin-5 using VDR knockout (VDR-/-) and intestinal epithelial VDR knockout mice (VDR{Delta}IEC) with chemical-induced colon cancer and an epithelial VDR overexpression model. Human samples, organoids, and intestinal epithelial cells were used to determine the underlying mechanisms.\n\nResultsIn human colon cancer, colonic VDR expression was low and was significantly correlated with a reduction of Claudin-5 mRNA and protein. In the colon of VDR-/- and VDR{Delta}IEC mice, deletion of VDR led to lower protein and mRNA levels of Claudin-5. Intestine permeability was increased in the AOM-DSS-induced VDR-/- colon cancer model. Lack of VDR and a reduction of Claudin-5 are associated with an increased number of tumors in the VDR-/- and VDR{Delta}IEC mice. Furthermore, gain and loss of function studies have identified CLDN-5 as a downstream target of the VDR signaling pathway. Epithelial VDR overexpression protected against the loss of Claudin 5 in response to intestinal inflammation\n\nConclusionThis study advances the understanding of how VDR regulates intestinal barrier functions in tumorigenesis as a biomarker and potential treatment.\n\nA short summaryO_LIWhat is already known about this subject?

VDR is important for the maintenance of the physiological level of the TJ protein Claudin-5 in the colon. The CLDN-5 gene is a downstream target of the VDR signaling pathway. Lack of VDR led to a reduction of Claudin-5 in tumors, whereas enhancing VDR increased Claudin-5 to protect the intestinal epithelial cells from tumorigenesis.\nC_LIO_LIWe report fecal VDR reduction in a colon cancer model.

    "abstract": "The mitotic checkpoint (also called spindle assembly checkpoint, SAC) is a signaling pathway that safeguards proper chromosome segregation. Proper functioning of the SAC depends on adequate protein concentrations and appropriate stoichiometries between SAC proteins. Yet very little is known about SAC gene expression. Here, we show in fission yeast (S. pombe) that a combination of short mRNA half-lives and long protein half-lives supports stable SAC protein levels. For the SAC genes mad2+ and mad3+, their short mRNA half-lives are supported by a high frequency of non-optimal codons. In contrast, mad1+ mRNA has a short half-life despite a low frequency of non-optimal codons and despite the lack of known destabilizing motifs. Hence, different SAC genes employ different strategies of expression. We further show that Mad1 homodimers form co-translationally, which may necessitate a certain codon usage pattern. Taken together, we propose that the codon usage of SAC genes is fine-tuned for proper SAC function. Our work shines light on gene expression features that promote spindle assembly checkpoint function and suggests that synonymous mutations may weaken the checkpoint.",

The major aggregating protein in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the RNA-binding protein TDP-43, is hyperphosphorylated in disease on several C-terminal serine residues, which is generally believed to promote TDP-43 aggregation. Here, we show that hyperphosphorylation by Casein kinase 1{delta} or C-terminal phosphomimetic mutations surprisingly reduce TDP-43 phase separation and aggregation and render TDP-43 condensates more liquid-like and dynamic. Multi-scale simulations reveal reduced homotypic interactions of TDP-43 low complexity domains through enhanced solvation of phosphomimetic residues. Cellular experiments show that phosphomimetic substitutions do not affect nuclear import or RNA regulatory functions of TDP-43, but suppress accumulation of TDP-43 in membrane-less organelles and promote its solubility in neurons. We propose that TDP-43 hyperphosphorylation may be a protective cellular response to counteract TDP-43 aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) and group II intron retroelements encode reverse transcriptases (RTs) that copy the retroelement transcript directly into host cell DNA, often at specific target sites. Biochemical characterization of these enzymes has been limited by recombinant expression and purification challenges, hampering understanding of their transposition mechanism and their exploitation for research and biotechnology. Properties of retroelement RTs substantiate their application for end-to-end RNA sequence capture. To investigate this utility, we first compared a non-LTR RT from Bombyx mori and a group II intron RT from Eubacterium rectale. Only the non-LTR RT showed processive template jumping, producing one cDNA from discontinuous templates each copied end-to-end. We also discovered an unexpected terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase activity of the RTs that adds nucleotide(s) of choice to 3 ends of single-stranded RNA or DNA. Combining these two types of activity with additional insights about non-templated nucleotide additions to duplexed cDNA product, we developed a streamlined protocol for linking Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) adaptors to both cDNA ends in a single RT reaction. When benchmarked using a reference pool of microRNAs (miRNAs), library production using modified non-LTR retroelment RT for Ordered Two-Template Relay (OTTR) outperformed all commercially available kits and rivaled the low bias of technically demanding home-brew protocols. We applied OTTR to inventory RNAs purified from extracellular vesicles (EVs), identifying miRNAs as well as myriad other non-coding (nc) RNAs and ncRNA fragments. Our results establish the utility of OTTR for automation-friendly, low-bias, end-to-end RNA sequence inventories of complex ncRNA samples.\n\nSignificanceRetrotransposons are non-infectious mobile genetic elements that proliferate in host genomes via an RNA intermediate that is copied into DNA by a reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme. RTs are important for biotechnological applications involving information capture from RNA, since RNA is first converted into complementary DNA for detection or sequencing. Here, we biochemically characterize RTs from two retroelements and uncover several activities that allowed us to design a streamlined, efficient workflow for determining the inventory of RNA sequences in processed RNA pools. The unique properties of non-retroviral RT activities obviate many technical issues associated with current methods of RNA sequence analysis, with wide applications in research, biotechnology, and diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "The baculovirus-insect cell expression system is readily utilized to produce viral glycoproteins for research as well as for subunit vaccines and vaccine candidates, for instance against SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, the glycoforms of recombinant proteins derived from this expression system are inherently different from mammalian cell-derived glycoforms with mainly complex-type N-glycans attached, and the impact of these differences in protein glycosylation on the immunogenicity is severely underinvestigated. This applies also to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which is the antigen target of all licensed vaccines and vaccine candidates including virus like particles and subunit vaccines that are variants of the spike protein. Here, we expressed the transmembrane-deleted human {beta}-1,2 N-acetlyglucosamintransferases I and II (MGAT1{triangleup}TM and MGAT2{triangleup}TM) and the {beta}-1,4-galactosyltransferase (GalT{triangleup}TM) in E. coli to in-vitro remodel the N-glycans of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein derived from insect cells. In a cell-free sequential one-pot reaction, fucosylated and afucosylated paucimannose-type N-glycans were converted to complex-type galactosylated N-glycans. In the future, this in-vitro glycoengineering approach can be used to efficiently generate a wide range of N-glycans on antigens considered as vaccine candidates for animal trials and preclinical testing to better characterize the impact of N-glycosylation on immunity and to improve the efficacy of protein subunit vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing of the gene MAPT produces several isoforms of tau protein. Overexpression of these isoforms is characteristic of tauopathies, which are currently untreatable neurodegenerative diseases. Though non-canonical functions of tau have drawn interest, the role of tau isoforms in these diseases has not been fully examined and may reveal new details of tau-driven pathology. In particular, tau has been shown to promote activation of transposable elements -- highly regulated nucleotide sequences that replicate throughout the genome and can promote immunologic responses and cellular stress. This study examined tau isoforms roles in promoting cell damage and dysregulation of genes and transposable elements at a family-specific and locus-specific level. We performed immunofluorescence, Western blot and cytotoxicity assays, along with paired-end RNA sequencing on differentiated SH-SY5Y cells infected with lentiviral constructs of tau isoforms and treated with amyloid-beta oligomers. Our transcriptomic findings were validated using publicly available RNA-sequencing data from Alzheimers disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and control human samples from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for AD (AMP-AD).\n\nSignificance for biochemical assays was determined using Wilcoxon ranked-sum tests and false discovery rate. Transcriptome analysis was conducted through DESeq2 and the TEToolkit suite available from the Hammell lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Our analyses show overexpression of different tau isoforms and their interactions with amyloid-beta in SH-SY5Y cells result in isoform-specific changes in the transcriptome, with locus-specific transposable element dysregulation patterns paralleling those seen in patients with Alzheimers disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. Locus-level transposable element expression showed increased dysregulation of L1 and Alu sites, which have been shown to drive pathology in other neurological diseases. We also demonstrated differences in rates of cell death in SH-SY5Y cells depending on tau isoform overexpression. These results demonstrate the importance of examining tau isoforms role in neurodegeneration and of further examining transposable element dysregulation in tauopathies.",

    "abstract": "Temperament is an innate, stable predisposition towards particular emotional and behavioral responses. In humans, certain temperaments are associated with a heightened risk of developing anxiety later in life. Non-human animals, including rodents, also exhibit innate, stable dispositions; these are referred to as behavioral phenotypes. The interaction between behavioral phenotype and early life adverse events is critical for the development of maladaptive anxiety. Rodent studies of typically developing animals have identified a number of mechanisms that protect against aversive experiences in early life. One such mechanism is an early life quiescence of threat learning, which protects against the effects of stress and facilitates safety and attachment learning. However, little is known about the factors that alleviate the effects of early life aversive events on phenotypes vulnerable to pathological anxiety. Here, we examined threat learning and the stress response in selectively-bred infant rats that show an anxiety-like phenotype relative to typically developing animals. We investigated the potential roles of maternal presence and the anxiolytic neurotrophic factor fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) in regulating threat learning and the stress response in infant anxiety-like phenotype animals. We observed that rats selectively-bred for anxiety-like behaviors could acquire conditioned freezing earlier in life than typically developing animals. FGF2 administration on postnatal day 1 (PND 1) and maternal presence during threat conditioning were both capable of suppressing this early emergence of conditioned freezing. However, neither FGF2 nor maternal presence during threat conditioning were associated with reduced corticosterone levels during threat conditioning. Our results suggest that although an anxiety-like phenotype may be associated with early threat learning, environmental factors (such as maternal presence) and pharmacological intervention (such as modulation of the FGF2 system) may be capable of counteracting that early aversive learning. Interventions in vulnerable infants may thus decrease the impact of aversive events.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to test whether post-stroke oral administration of a small molecule p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) modulator (LM11A-31) can augment neuronal survival and improve recovery in a mouse model of stroke. Mice were administered LM11A-31 for up to 12 weeks, beginning 1 week after stroke. Metabolomic analysis revealed that after 2 weeks of daily treatment, mice that received LM11A-31 were distinct from vehicle treated mice by principal component analysis and had higher levels of serotonin, acetylcholine, and dopamine in their ipsilateral hemisphere. LM11A-31 treatment also improved redox homeostasis by restoring reduced glutathione. It also offset a stroke induced reduction in glycolysis by increasing acetyl-CoA. There was no effect on cytokine levels in the infarct. At 13 weeks following stroke, adaptive immune cell infiltration in the infarct was unchanged in LM11A-31 treated mice, indicating that LM11A-31 does not alter the chronic inflammatory response to stroke at the site of the infarct. However, LM11A-31 treated mice had less brain atrophy, neurodegeneration, tau pathology, and microglial activation in other regions of the ipsilateral hemisphere. These findings correlated with improved recovery of motor function on a ladder test, improved sensorimotor and cognitive abilities on a nest construction test, and less impulsivity in an open field test. These data support small molecule modulation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor for preserving neuronal health and function during stroke recovery.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe findings from this study introduce the p75 neurotrophin receptor as a novel small molecule target for promotion of stroke recovery. Given that LM11A-31 is in clinical trials as a potential therapy for Alzheimers disease, it could be considered as a candidate for assessment in stroke or vascular dementia studies.",

    "abstract": "The wasps Leptopilina heterotoma parasitize and ingest their Drosophila hosts. They produce extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the venom that are packed with proteins, some of which perform immune suppressive functions. EV interactions with blood cells of host larvae are linked to hematopoietic depletion, immune suppression, and parasite success. But how EVs disperse within the host, enter and kill hematopoietic cells are not well understood. Using an antibody marker for L. heterotoma EVs, we show that these parasite-derived structures are readily distributed within the hosts hemolymphatic system. EVs converge around the tightly clustered cells of the posterior signaling center (PSC) of the larval lymph gland, a small hematopoietic organ in Drosophila. The PSC serves as a source of developmental signals in naive animals. In wasp-infected animals, the PSC directs the differentiation of lymph gland progenitors into lamellocytes. These lamellocytes are needed to encapsulate the wasp egg and block parasite development. We found that L. heterotoma infection disassembles the PSC and PSC cells disperse into the disintegrating lymph gland lobes. Genetically manipulated PSC-less lymph glands remain non-responsive and largely intact in the face of L. heterotoma infection. We also show that the larval lymph gland progenitors use the endocytic machinery to internalize EVs. Once inside, L. heterotoma EVs damage the Rab7- and LAMP1-positive late endocytic and phagolysosomal compartments. Rab5 maintains hematopoietic and immune quiescence as Rab5 knockdown results in hematopoietic over-proliferation and ectopic lamellocyte differentiation. Thus, both aspects of anti-parasite immunity, i.e., (a) phagocytosis of the wasps immune-suppressive EVs, and (b) progenitor differentiation for wasp egg encapsulation reside in the lymph gland. These results help explain why the lymph gland is specifically and precisely targeted for destruction. The parasites simultaneous and multipronged approach to block cellular immunity not only eliminates blood cells, but also tactically blocks the genetic programming needed for supplementary hematopoietic differentiation necessary for host success. In addition to its known functions in hematopoiesis, our results highlight a previously unrecognized phagocytic role of the lymph gland in cellular immunity. EV-mediated virulence strategies described for L. heterotoma are likely to be shared by other parasitoid wasps; their understanding can improve the design and development of novel therapeutics and biopesticides as well as help protect biodiversity.\n\nAuthor summaryParasitoid wasps serve as biological control agents of agricultural insect pests and are worthy of study. Many parasitic wasps develop inside their hosts to emerge as free-living adults. To overcome the resistance of their hosts, parasitic wasps use varied and ingenious strategies such as mimicry, evasion, bioactive venom, virus-like particles, viruses, and extracellular vesicles (EVs). We describe the effects of a unique class of EVs containing virulence proteins and produced in the venom of wasps that parasitize fruit flies of Drosophila species. EVs from Leptopilina heterotoma are widely distributed throughout the Drosophila hosts circulatory system after infection. They enter and kill macrophages by destroying the very same subcellular machinery that facilitates their uptake. An important protein in this process, Rab5, is needed to maintain the identity of the macrophage; when Rab5 function is reduced, macrophages turn into a different cell type called lamellocytes. Activities in the EVs can eliminate lamellocytes as well. EVs also interfere with the hosts genetic program that promotes lamellocyte differentiation needed to block parasite development. Thus, wasps combine specific preemptive and reactive strategies to deplete their hosts of the very cells that would otherwise sequester and kill them. These findings have applied value in agricultural pest control and medical therapeutics.",

Compared to naive follicular B-cells, GC B-cells have several notable changes in their cell surface glycans. While these changes are routinely used to identify the GC, functional roles for these changes have yet to be ascribed. Detection of GCs by the antibody GL7 reflects a reduction in the glycan ligands for CD22, which is an inhibitory co-receptor of the B-cell receptor (BCR). To test a functional role for downregulated CD22 ligands in the GC, we generated a mouse model that maintains CD22 ligands on GC B-cells. With this model, we demonstrate that glycan remodeling is crucial for proper GC B-cell response, including plasma cell output and affinity maturation of antibodies. The defect we observe in this model is dependent on CD22, highlighting that coordinated downregulation of CD22 ligands on B cells plays a critical function in the GC. Collectively, our study uncovers a crucial role for glycan remodeling and CD22 in B-cell fitness in the GC.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can reduce the risk of hospitalization when administered early during COVID-19 disease. However, the emergence of variants of concern has negatively impacted the therapeutic use of some authorized mAbs. Using a high throughput B-cell screening pipeline, we isolated a highly potent SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific antibody called LY-CoV1404 (also known as bebtelovimab). LY-CoV1404 potently neutralizes authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus, including the prototype, B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2). In pseudovirus neutralization studies, LY-CoV1404 retains potent neutralizing activity against numerous variants including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.617.2, B.1.427/B.1.429, P.1, B.1.526, B.1.1.529, and the BA.2 subvariant and retains binding to spike proteins with a variety of underlying RBD mutations including K417N, L452R, E484K, and N501Y. Structural analysis reveals that the contact residues of the LY-CoV1404 epitope are highly conserved with the exception of N439 and N501. Notably, the binding and neutralizing activity of LY-CoV1404 is unaffected by the most common mutations at these positions (N439K and N501Y). The breadth of reactivity to amino acid substitutions present among current VOC together with broad and potent neutralizing activity and the relatively conserved epitope suggest that LY-CoV1404 has the potential to be an effective therapeutic agent to treat all known variants causing COVID-19.\n\nIn BriefLY-CoV1404 is a potent SARS-CoV-2-binding antibody that neutralizes all known variants of concern and whose epitope is rarely mutated.\n\nHighlightsO_LILY-CoV1404 potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 authentic virus and known variants of concern including the B.1.1.529 (Omicron), the BA.2 Omicron subvariant, and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants\nC_LIO_LINo loss of potency against currently circulating variants\nC_LIO_LIBinding epitope on RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is rarely mutated in GISAID database\nC_LIO_LIBreadth of neutralizing activity and potency supports clinical development\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an avian coronavirus, can be isolated and cultured in tracheal organ cultures (TOCs), embryonated eggs and cell cultures. TOCs and embryonated eggs are commonly used for viral isolation but use of these is laborious and expensive. Cell cultures have been used only with IBV strains that have previously been adapted to grow under laboratory conditions, and not for primary isolation. Previous studies using the coronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) have suggested that foetal bovine serum (FBS), a common component of cell culture media, can inhibit the adsorption of coronaviruses onto the host cell membrane receptors. In the present study, the replication of IBV in primary chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cell cultures and the Leghorn hepatocellular carcinoma (LMH) cell line was examined using two different cell culture media, one containing FBS and the other containing yeast extract (YE). A reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay was used to quantify viral RNA copies in cell lysates. The highest concentrations of viral genomes were observed when the cell culture medium did not contain FBS. Examination of the infectivity of virus grown in CEK cell cultures was examined by titration in embryonated chicken eggs, demonstrating that the cell lysate from CEK cell cultures in medium without FBS contained a higher median embryo infectious dose (EID50) than that from CEK cell cultures in medium containing FBS. These results suggest that improved replication of IBV in cell cultures can be achieved by the omission of FBS from the cell culture medium. This may enhance the potential for production of vaccines in cell culture and facilitate the isolation of emergent IBV strains in cell cultures.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies suggest that short peptides from the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain of gp41 expressed on the cell surface are more potent inhibitors of HIV-1 entry than soluble analogs. However, their therapeutic potential has only been examined using lentiviral vectors. Here, we aimed to develop CRISPR/Cas9-based fusion inhibitory peptide knock-in (KI) technology for the generation and selection of HIV-1-resistant T cells. First, we cloned a series of HIV-1 fusion inhibitory peptides and embedded them in CD52, the shortest GPI-anchored protein, which efficiently delivers epitope tags to the cell surface and maintains a sufficient level of KI. Among the seven peptides tested, MT-C34, HP-23L, and 2P23 exhibited significant activity against both cell-free and cell-to-cell HIV-1 infection. Unlike membrane-bound peptides, the shed variant of MT-C34 provided insufficient protection against HIV-1 due to its low concentrations in the culture medium. Using Cas9 plasmids or ribonucleoprotein electroporation and cell sorting with antibodies raised against gp41 peptides, we generated CEM/R5 cells with biallelic KI of MT-C34 (embedded in CD52 for expression in lipid rafts) and 2P23 (N-terminally fused to CXCR4). In combination, these peptides provided a higher level of protection than individual KI. By extending homology arms and substituting PCR donor DNA with a plasmid containing signals for nuclear localization, we achieved KI of MT-C34 into CXCR4 loci and HIV-1 proviral DNA at levels of up to 35% in CEM/R5 cells and increased KI occurrence from undetectable to 4-5% in CD4 lymphocytes. Comparative analysis of lentiviral and HDR-based delivery strategies showed that KI led to the higher MT-C34 expression and stronger protection of primary CD4 lymphocytes from HIV-1 than lentiviral transduction, albeit the efficiency of KI needs further improvements in order to meet clinical requirements. Thus, the developed CRISPR/Cas9 platform offers a new opportunity for antiviral peptide delivery with a concomitant precise genetic modification of targeted locus that can be employed to strengthen cell protection against HIV.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYHIV is a human lentivirus that infects CD4-positive immune cells and, when left untreated, manifests in the fatal disease known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not leading to viral clearance, and HIV persists in the organism as a latent provirus. One way to control infection is to increase the population of HIV-resistant CD4 lymphocytes via entry molecule knockout or expression of different antiviral genes. Peptides from the heptad repeat (HR) domain of gp41 are potent inhibitors of HIV-1 fusion, especially when designed to express on the cell surface. Individual gp41 peptides encoded by therapeutic lentiviral vectors have been evaluated and some have entered clinical trials. However, a CRISPR/Cas9-based gp41 peptide delivery platform that operates through concomitant target gene modification has not yet been developed due to low knock-in (KI) rates in primary cells. Here, we systematically evaluated the antiviral activity of different HR2-peptides cloned into the shortest carrier molecule, CD52. The resulting small-size transgene constructs encoding selected peptides, in combination with improvements to enhance donor vector nuclear import, helped to overcome precise editing restrictions in CD4 lymphocytes. Using KI into CXCR4, we demonstrated different options for target gene modification, effectively protecting edited cells against HIV-1.",

    "abstract": "Developing media to sustain cell growth and production is an essential and ongoing activity in bioprocess development. Modifications to media can often address host or product-specific challenges, such as low productivity or poor product quality. For other applications, systematic design of new media can facilitate the adoption of new industrially relevant alternative hosts. Despite manifold existing methods, common approaches for optimization often remain time and labor intensive. We present here a novel approach to conventional media blending that leverages stable, simple, concentrated stock solutions to enable rapid improvement of measurable phenotypes of interest. We applied this modular methodology to generate high-performing media for two phenotypes of interest: biomass accumulation and heterologous protein production, using high-throughput, milliliter-scale batch fermentations of Pichia pastoris as a model system. In addition to these examples, we also created a flexible open-source package for modular blending automation on a low-cost liquid handling system to facilitate wide use of this method. Our modular blending method enables rapid, flexible media development, requiring minimal labor investment and prior knowledge of the host organism, and should enable developing improved media for other hosts and phenotypes of interest.",

    "abstract": "Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been emerging across the globe, continuing to threaten the efforts to end COVID-19 pandemic. Recent data indicate the prevalence of variants with N440K Spike substitution in several parts of India, which is under the second wave of the pandemic. Here, we first analyze the prevalence of N440K variants within the sequences submitted from India and identify a rising trend of its spread across various clusters. We then compare the replicative fitness and infectivity of a prototype of this variant with two other previously prevalent strains. The N440K variant produced ten times higher infectious viral titers than a prevalent A2a strain, and over 1000 folds higher titers than a much less prevalent A3i strain prototype in Caco2 cells. Similar results were detected in Calu-3 cells as well, confirming the increased potency of the N440K variant. Interestingly, A3i strain showed the highest viral RNA levels, but the lowest infectious titers in the culture supernatants, indicating the absence of correlation between the RNA content and the infectivity of the sample. N440K mutation has been reported in several viral sequences across India and based on our results, we predict that the higher infectious titers achieved by N440K variant could possibly lead to its higher rate of transmission. Availability of more sequencing data in the immediate future would help understand the potential spread of this variant in more detail.",

    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) possesses a discriminative polybasic cleavage motif in its spike protein that is recognized by host furin protease. Proteolytic cleavage activates the spike protein and influences both the cellular entry pathway and cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigated the impact of the furin cleavage site on viral growth and pathogensis using a hamster animal model infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants bearing mutations at the furin cleavage site (S gene mutants). In the airway tissues of hamsters, the S gene mutants exhibited a low growth property. In contrast to parental pathogenic SARS-CoV-2, hamsters infected with the S gene mutants showed no body weight loss and only a mild inflammatory response, indicating the attenuated variant nature of S gene mutants. We reproduced the attenuated growth of S gene mutants in primary differenciated human airway epithelial cells. This transient infection was enough to induce protective neutralizing antibodies crossreacting with different SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Consequently, hamsters inoculated with S gene mutants showed resistance to subsequent infection with both the parental strain and the currently emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants belonging to lineages B.1.1.7 and P.1. Together, our findings revealed that the loss of the furin cleavage site causes attenuation in the airway tissues of SARS-CoV-2 and highlights the potential benefits of S gene mutants as potential immunogens.",

    "abstract": "The genetic diversity of viral populations is a key driver of the spatial and temporal diffusion of viruses; yet, studying the diversity of whole genomes from natural populations still remains a challenge. Phylodynamic approaches are commonly used for RNA viruses harboring small genomes, but have only rarely been applied to DNA viruses with larger genomes. Here, we used the Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome (POMS, a disease that affects oyster farms around the world) as a model to study the genetic diversity of its causative agent, the Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) in the three main French oyster-farming areas. Using ultra-deep sequencing on individual moribund oysters and an innovative combination of bioinformatics tools, we de novo assembled 21 OsHV-1 new genomes. Combining quantification of major and minor genetic variations, phylogenetic analysis and ancestral state reconstruction of discrete traits approaches; we assessed the connectivity of OsHV-1 viral populations between the three oyster-farming areas. Our results suggest that the Marennes- Oleron Bay represents the main source of OsHV-1 diversity, from where the virus has dispersed to other farming areas, a scenario consistent with current practices of oyster transfers in France. We demonstrate that phylodynamic approaches can be applied to aquatic DNA viruses to determine how epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes act and potentially interact to shape their diversity patterns.\n\nImportancePhylogeography is a field of research that attempts to reconstruct the relationships between individual genotypes within a species and then correlate these genealogical relationships with their geographic and temporal origin. This field of research has become an essential step in the understanding of pandemics, in particular to determine the origin, spread and evolution of a pathogen as currently illustrated in studies on viral pandemics. However, because phylogeographic analyses are based on genome variation, stable genomes yield less information than labile genomes. Accordingly, viruses with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genomes generally have lower nucleotide diversity than RNA viruses. In this study, by combining the use of both major and minor genetic variations with phylogeographic analyses of the oyster herpesvirus OsHV-1, we highlight genealogical relationships that are not depicted in phylogenetic trees based on consensus viral genomes only. These data offer a plausible scenario reflecting the origin and spread of OsHV-1 populations between oyster- farming sites.",

To create a seasonal combination vaccine targeting influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 that is also amenable to frequent reformulation, we have developed a recombinant influenza A virus (IAV) genetic platform that \"reprograms\" the virus to package an immunogenic domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein onto IAV particles.

It was recently demonstrated that a homologue of adenylosuccinate synthase (PurZ) and a dATP triphosphohydrolase (DatZ) are two important pieces of the metabolism of 2-aminoadenine, participating in the synthesis of ZTGC-DNA. Here, we determine that S-2L PurZ can use either dATP or ATP as a source of energy, thereby also depleting the pool of nucleotides in dATP. Furthermore, we identify a conserved gene (mazZ) located between purZ and datZ genes in Siphoviridae phage genomes, and show that it encodes a (d)GTP-specific diphosphohydrolase, thereby providing the substrate of PurZ in the 2-aminoadenine synthesis pathway. High-resolution crystal structures of S-2L PurZ and MazZ with their respective substrates provide a rationale for their specificities. The Z-cluster made of these three genes - datZ, mazZ and purZ - was expressed in E. coli, resulting in a successful incorporation of 2-aminoadenine in the bacterial chromosomal and plasmidic DNA. This work opens the possibility to study synthetic organisms containing ZTGC-DNA.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, which regulate the expression of thousands of genes; miRNAs silence gene expression from complementary mRNAs through translational repression and mRNA decay. For decades, the function of miRNAs has been studied primarily by ensemble methods, where a bulk collection of molecules is measured outside cells. Thus, the behavior of individual molecules during miRNA-mediated gene silencing, as well as their spatiotemporal regulation inside cells, remains mostly unknown. Here we report single-molecule methods to visualize each step of miRNA-mediated gene silencing in situ inside cells. Simultaneous visualization of single mRNAs, translation, and miRNA-binding revealed that miRNAs preferentially bind to translated mRNAs rather than untranslated mRNAs. Spatiotemporal analysis based on our methods uncovered that miRNAs bind to mRNAs immediately after nuclear export. Subsequently, miRNAs induced translational repression and mRNA decay within 30 and 60 min, respectively, after the binding to mRNAs. This methodology provides a framework for studying mRNA regulation at the single-molecule level with spatiotemporal information inside cells.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a eukaryotic, translation-dependent degradation pathway that targets mRNAs with premature termination codons and also regulates the expression of some mRNAs that encode full-length proteins. Although many genes express NMD-sensitive transcripts, identifying them based on short-read sequencing data remains a challenge.\n\nResultsTo identify and analyze endogenous targets of NMD, we applied cDNA Nanopore sequencing and short-read sequencing to human cells with varying expression levels of NMD factors. Our approach detects full-length NMD substrates that are highly unstable and increase in levels or even only appear when NMD is inhibited. Among the many new NMD-targeted isoforms that our analysis identified, most derive from alternative exon usage. The isoform-aware analysis revealed many genes with significant changes in splicing but no significant changes in overall expression levels upon NMD knockdown. NMD-sensitive mRNAs have more exons in the 3'UTR and, for those mRNAs with a termination codon in the last exon, the length of the 3'UTR per se does not correlate with NMD sensitivity. Analysis of splicing signals reveals isoforms where NMD has been co-opted in the regulation of gene expression, though the main function of NMD seems to be ridding the transcriptome of isoforms resulting from spurious splicing events.\n\nConclusionsLong-read sequencing enabled the identification of many novel NMD-sensitive mRNAs and revealed both known and unexpected features concerning their biogenesis and their biological role. Our data provide a highly valuable resource of human NMD transcript targets for future genomic and transcriptomic applications.",

We repot that aging impairs the intrinsic FoxM1-dependent endothelial regeneration and vascular repair program and causes persistent lung injury and high mortality following sepsis. Therapeutic gene transduction of FOXM1 in vascular endothelium or treatment with FDA-approved drug Decitabine was sufficient to reactivate FoxM1-dependent lung endothelial regeneration in aged mice, reverse aging-impaired resolution of inflammatory injury, and promote survival. In COVID-19 lung autopsy samples, FOXM1 expression was not induced in vascular endothelial cells of elderly patients in contrast to mid-age patients.

    "abstract": "A major challenge to our understanding of translational control has been deconvolving the individual impact specific regulatory factors have on the complex dynamics of mRNA translation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), for example, guide Argonaute and associated proteins to target mRNAs, where they direct gene silencing in multiple ways that are not well understood. To better deconvolve these dynamics, we have developed technology to directly visualize and quantify the impact of human Argonaute2 (Ago2) on the translation and subcellular localization of individual reporter mRNAs in living cells. We show that our combined translation and Ago2 tethering system reflects endogenous miRNA-mediated gene silencing. Using the system, we find that Ago2 association leads to progressive silencing of translation at individual mRNA. The timescale of silencing was similar to that of translation, consistent with a role for Ago2 in blocking translation initiation, leading to ribosome runoff. At early time points, we observed occasional brief bursts of translational activity at Ago2-tethered mRNAs undergoing silencing, suggesting that translational repression may initially be reversible. At later time points, Ago2-tethered mRNAs cluster and coalesce with endogenous P-bodies, where a translationally silent state is maintained. These results provide a framework for exploring miRNA-mediated gene regulation in live cells at the single-molecule level. Furthermore, our tethering-based, single-molecule reporter system will likely have wide-ranging application in studying general RNA-protein interactions.",

    "abstract": "Genomic prediction typically relies on associations between single-site polymorphisms and traits of interest. This representation of genomic variability has been successful for prediction within populations. However, it usually cannot capture the complex effects due to combination of alleles in haplotypes. Therefore, accuracy across populations has usually been low. Here we present a novel and cost-effective method for imputing cis haplotype associated RNA expression (HARE, RNA expression of genes by haplotype), studied their transferability across tissues, and evaluated genomic prediction models within and across populations. HARE focuses on tightly linked cis acting causal variants in the immediate vicinity of the gene, while excluding trans effects from diffusion and metabolism, so it would be more transferrable across different tissues and populations. We showed that HARE estimates captured one-third of the variation in gene expression and were more transferable across diverse tissues than the measured transcript expression. HARE estimates were used in genomic prediction models evaluated within and across two diverse maize panels - a diverse association panel (Goodman Association panel) and a large half-sib panel (Nested Association Mapping panel) - for predicting 26 complex traits. HARE resulted in up to 15% higher prediction accuracy than control approaches that preserved haplotype structure, suggesting that HARE carried functional information in addition to information about haplotype structure. The largest increase was observed when the model was trained in the Nested Association Mapping panel and tested in the Goodman Association panel. Additionally, HARE yielded higher within-population prediction accuracy as compared to measured expression values. The accuracy achieved by measured expression was variable across tissues whereas accuracy using HARE was more stable across tissues. Therefore, imputing RNA expression of genes by haplotype is stable, cost-effective, and transferable across populations.\n\nAuthor summaryThe increasing availability of genomic data has been widely used in the prediction of many traits. However, genome wide prediction has been mostly carried out within populations and without explicit modeling of RNA or protein expression. In this study, we explored the prediction of field traits within and across populations using estimated RNA expression attributable to only the DNA sequence around a gene. We showed that the estimated RNA expression was more transferable than overall measured RNA expression. We improved prediction of field traits up to 15% using estimated gene expression as compared to observed expression or gene sequence alone. Overall, these findings indicate that structural and functional information in the gene sequence are highly transferable.",

    "abstract": "Apis mellifera L., the western honey bee is a major crop pollinator that plays a key role in beekeeping and serves as an important model organism in social behavior studies. Recent efforts have improved on the quality of the honey bee reference genome and developed a chromosome-level assembly of sixteen chromosomes, two of which are gapless. However, the rest suffer from 51 gaps, 160 unplaced/unlocalized scaffolds, and the lack of 2 distal telomeres. The gaps are located at the hard-to-assemble extended highly repetitive chromosomal regions that may contain functional genomic elements. Here, we use de-novo re-assemblies from the most recent reference genome Amel_HAv_3.1 raw reads and other long-read-based assemblies (INRA_AMelMel_1.0, ASM1384120v1, and ASM1384124v1) of the honey bee genome to resolve 13 gaps, five unplaced/unlocalized scaffolds and, the lacking telomeres of the Amel_HAv_3.1. The total length of the resolved gaps is 848,747 bp. The accuracy of the corrected assembly was validated by mapping PacBio reads and performing gene annotation assessment. Comparative analysis suggests that the PacBio-reads-based assemblies of the honey bee genomes failed in the same highly repetitive extended regions of the chromosomes, especially on chromosome 10. To fully resolve these extended repetitive regions, further work using ultra-long Nanopore sequencing would be needed. Our updated assembly facilitates more accurate reference-guided scaffolding and marker/sequence mapping in honey bee genomics studies.",

    "abstract": "Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that protect the ends of chromosomes and are essential for chromosome stability in Eukaryotes. In cells, individual telomeres form distinct globules of finite size that appear to be smaller than expected for bare DNA. Moreover, upon changes in their protein composition, telomeres can cluster to form telomere-induced-foci (TIFs) or co-localize with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies. The physical basis for collapse of individual telomeres and coalescence of multiple ones remains unclear, as does the relationship between these two phenomena. By combining single-molecule measurements, optical microscopy, turbidity assays, and simulations, we show that the telomere scaffolding protein TRF2 can condense individual DNA chains and drives coalescence of multiple DNA molecules, leading to phase separation and the formation of liquid-like droplets. Addition of the TRF2 binding protein hRap1 modulates phase boundaries and tunes the specificity of solution demixing while simultaneously altering the degree of DNA compaction. Our results suggest that the condensation of single telomeres and formation of biomolecular condensates containing multiple telomeres are two different outcomes driven by the same set of molecular interactions. Moreover, binding partners, such as other telomere components, can alter those interactions to promote single-chain DNA compaction over multiple-chain phase separation.",

    "abstract": "The neural circuits that support human cognition are a topic of enduring interest. Yet, the lack of tools available to map human brain circuits has precluded our ability to trace the human and non-human primate connectome. We harnessed high-resolution connectomic, anatomic, and transcriptomic data to investigate the evolution and development of frontal cortex circuitry. We applied machine learning to RNA sequencing data to find corresponding ages between humans and macaques and to compare the development of circuits across species. We transcriptionally defined neural circuits by testing for associations between gene expression and white matter maturation. We then considered transcriptional and structural growth to test whether frontal cortex circuit maturation is unusually extended in humans relative to other species. We also considered gene expression and high-resolution diffusion MR tractography of adult brains to test for cross-species variation in frontal cortex circuits. We found that frontal cortex circuitry development is extended in primates, and concomitant with an expansion in cortico-cortical pathways compared with mice in adulthood. Importantly, we found that these parameters varied relatively little across humans and studied primates. These data identify a surprising collection of conserved features in frontal cortex circuits across humans and Old World monkeys. Our work demonstrates that integrating transcriptional and connectomic data across temporal dimensions is a robust approach to trace the evolution of brain connectomics in primates.\n\nSignificance StatementWe lack appropriate tools to visualize the human brain connectome. We develop new approaches to study connections in the human and non-human primate brains. The integration of transcription with structure offers an unprecedented opportunity to study circuitry evolution. Our integrative approach finds corresponding ages across species and transcriptionally defines neural circuits. We used this information to test for variation in circuit maturation across species and found a surprising constellation of similar features in frontal cortex neural circuits across humans and primates. Integrating across scales of biological organization expands the repertoire of tools available to study connections in primates, which opens new avenues to study connections in health and diseases of the human brain.",

    "abstract": "Community-associated, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) lineages have emerged in many geographically distinct regions around the world during the past 30 years. Here, we apply consistent phylodynamic methods across multiple community-associated MRSA lineages to describe and contrast their patterns of emergence and dissemination. We generated whole genome sequencing data for the Australian sequence type (ST) 93-MRSA-IV from remote communities in Far North Queensland and Papua New Guinea, and the Bengal Bay ST772-MRSA-V clone from metropolitan communities in Pakistan. Increases in the effective reproduction number (Re) and sustained transmission (Re > 1) coincided with spread of progenitor methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) in remote northern Australia, dissemination of the ST93-MRSA-IV geno-type into population centers on the Australian East Coast, and sub-sequent importation into the highlands of Papua New Guinea and Far North Queensland. Analysis of a ST772-MRSA-V cluster in Pakistan suggests that sustained transmission in the community following importation of resistant genotypes may be more common than previously thought. Applying the same phylodynamic methods to existing lineage datasets, we identified common signatures of epidemic growth in the emergence and epidemiological trajectory of community-associated S. aureus lineages from America, Asia, Australasia and Europe. Surges in Re were observed at the divergence of antibiotic resistant strains, coinciding with their establishment in regional population centers. Epidemic growth was also observed amongst drug-resistant MSSA clades in Africa and northern Australia. Our data suggest that the emergence of community-associated MRSA and MSSA lineages in the late 20th century was driven by a combination of antibiotic resistant genotypes and host epidemiology, leading to abrupt changes in lineage-wide transmission dynamics and sustained transmission in regional population centers.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes acute and lasting impacts on the brain, driving pathology along anatomical, cellular, and behavioral dimensions. Rodent models offer the opportunity to study TBI in a controlled setting, and enable analysis of the temporal progression that occurs from injury to recovery. We applied transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis, characterize gene expression and in ipsilateral hippocampus at 1 and 14 days following moderate lateral fluid percussion (LFP) injury. This approach enabled us to identify differential gene expression (DEG) modules with distinct expression trajectories across the two time points. The major DEG modules represented genes that were up- or downregulated acutely, but largely recovered by 14 days. As expected, DEG modules with acute upregulation were associated with cell death and astrocytosis. Interestingly, acutely downregulated DEGs related to neurotransmission mostly recovered by two weeks. Upregulated DEG modules related to inflammation were not necessarily elevated acutely, but were strongly upregulated after two weeks. We identified a smaller DEG module with delayed downregulation at 14 days including genes related to cholesterol metabolism and amyloid beta clearance. Finally, differential expression was paralleled by changes in H3K4me3 at the promoters of differentially expressed genes at one day following TBI. Following TBI, changes in cell viability, function and ultimately behavior are dynamic processes. Our results show how transcriptomics in the preclinical setting has the potential to identify biomarkers for injury severity and/or recovery, to identify potential therapeutic targets, and, in the future, to evaluate efficacy of an intervention beyond measures of cell death or spatial learning.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosomatids are a diverse family of protozoan parasites, some of which cause devastating human and livestock diseases. There are two distinct infection life-cycles in trypanosomatids; some species complete their entire life-cycle in a single host (monoxenous) while others infect two hosts (dixenous). Dixenous trypanosomatids are mostly vectored by insects, and the human trypanosomatid diseases are caused mainly by vectored parasites. While infection prevalence has been described for subsets of hosts and trypanosomatids, little is known about whether monoxenous and dixenous trypanosomatids differ in infection prevalence. Here, we use meta-analyses to synthesise all published evidence of trypanosomatid infection prevalence for the last two decades, encompassing 931 unique host-trypansomatid systems. In examining 581 studies that describe infection prevalence, we find, strikingly, that monoxenous species are two-fold more prevalent than dixenous species across all hosts. We also find that dixenous trypanosomatids have significantly lower infection prevalence in insects than their non-insect hosts. Within monoxenous trypanosomatids, genera infecting bees are most prevalent and infection prevalence does not vary between wild and managed bees. To our knowledge, these results reveal for the first time, a fundamental difference in infection prevalence according to host specificity where vectored species suffer from lower infection prevalence as a result of a  jack of all trades, master of none style trade-off between the vector and subsequent hosts.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the number of sequenced ancient genomes, there has been increasing interest in using this new information to study past and present adaptation. Such an additional temporal component has the promise of providing improved power for the estimation of natural selection. Over the last decade, statistical approaches for detection and quantification of natural selection from ancient DNA (aDNA) data have been developed. However, most of the existing methods do not allow us to estimate the timing of natural selection along with its strength, which is key to understanding the evolution and persistence of organismal diversity. Additionally, most methods ignore the fact that natural populations are almost always structured, which can result in overestimation of the effect of natural selection. To address these issues, we introduce a novel Bayesian framework for the inference of natural selection and gene migration from aDNA data with Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, co-estimating both timing and strength of natural selection and gene migration. Such an advance enables us to infer drivers of natural selection and gene migration by correlating genetic evolution with potential causes such as the changes in the ecological context in which an organism has evolved. The performance of our procedure is evaluated through extensive simulations, with its utility shown with an application to ancient chicken samples.",

    "abstract": "Classical views suggest that experienced affect is related to a specific bodily response (Fingerprint hypothesis), whereas recent perspectives challenge this view postulating that similar affective experiences rather evoke different physiological responses. To further advance this debate in the field, we used representational similarity analysis (N= 64) to investigate the correspondence between subjective affect (arousal and valence ratings) and physiological reactions (skin conductance response [SCR], startle blink response, heart rate and corrugator activity) across various emotion induction contexts (picture viewing task, sound listening task and imagery task). Significant similarities were exclusively observed between SCR and arousal in the picture viewing task. However, none of the other physiological measures showed a significant relation with valence and arousal ratings in any of the tasks. These findings tend to support the populations hypothesis, suggesting that there is no clear match between the evoked physiological responses and the experienced subjective affect between individuals.\n\nStatement of relevanceThe subjective affective experience evoked by an event is accompanied by physiological responses. The correspondence between physiological response patterns and the experienced affect, however, is still under debate. Classical views (Fingerprint hypothesis) suggest that affect is related to a specific physiological response, whereas recent perspectives (Populations hypothesis) challenge this view, postulating rather different physiological responses. In the current study, we used representational similarity analysis (RSA) to examine the relation between affective experience, assessed using valence and arousal ratings, and the evoked physiological reactivity across three affect-inducing contexts. Results showed significant similarities exclusively between SCR and arousal in the passive picture viewing task. However, none of the other physiological measures showed a significant relation with valence and arousal ratings in any of the tasks, supporting the populations hypothesis. These findings invite to reframe the relation between physiology and affect from invariant and homogeneous to variant and context-dependent.",

    "abstract": "The study of perceptual decision making in monkeys has provided insights into the process by which sensory evidence is integrated towards a decision. When monkeys make decisions with the knowledge of the motor actions the decisions bear upon, the process of evidence integration is instantiated by neurons involved in the selection of said actions. It is less clear how monkeys make decisions when unaware of the actions required to communicate their choice--what we refer to as  abstract decisions. We investigated this by training monkeys to associate the direction of motion of a noisy random-dot display with the color of two targets. Crucially, the targets were displayed at unpredictable locations after the motion stimulus was extinguished. We found that monkeys postponed decision formation until the targets were revealed. Neurons in the parietal association area LIP represented the integration of evidence leading to a choice, but as the stimulus was no longer visible, the samples of evidence must have been retrieved from short-term memory. Our results imply that when decisions are temporally unyoked from the motor actions they bear upon, decision formation is protracted until they can be framed in terms of motor actions.",

    "abstract": "The processing of sensory information, even at early processing stages, is influenced by the internal state of the animal. Internal states, such as arousal, are often characterized by relating neural activity to a single \"level\" of arousal, defined by a behavioral indicator such as pupil size. In this study, we expand the understanding of arousal-related modulations in sensory systems by uncovering nested timescales of pupil dynamics and their relationship to neural activity. Specifically, we observed coupling between spiking activity in the mouse dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus and pupil dynamics across timescales spanning three orders of magnitude, from seconds to minutes. Throughout all of these timescales, two distinct spiking patterns - tonic spikes and bursts - preferred opposing phases of pupil dynamics. This phase-coupling could not be explained by pupil size per se, transitions between locomotion and quiescence, or saccadic eye movements. Furthermore, this phase coupling persisted even during viewing of a naturalistic movie, where it contributed to differences in how visual information was encoded. We conclude that dLGN spiking activity is simultaneously influenced by arousal processes associated with pupil dynamics across a broad range of timescales, with implications for the transfer of sensory information to the cortex.",

    "abstract": "In biological neuronal networks, information representation and processing are achieved through plasticity learning rules that have been empirically characterized as sensitive to second and higher-order statistics in spike trains. However, most models in both computational neuroscience and machine learning aim to convert diverse statistical properties in inputs into first-order statistics in outputs, like in modern deep learning networks. In the context of classification, such schemes have merit for inputs like static images, but they are not well suited to capture the temporal structure in time series. In contrast, the recently developed covariance perceptron uses second-order statistics by mapping input covariances to output covariances in a consistent fashion. Here, we explore the applicability of covariance-based perceptron readouts in reservoir computing networks to classify synthetic multivariate time series structured at different statistical orders (first and second). We show that the second-order framework outperforms or matches the classical mean paradigm in terms of accuracy. Our results highlight a nontrivial relationship between input and reservoir properties in generating the output reservoir activity, which suggests an important role for recurrent connectivity in transforming information representations in biologically inspired architectures. Finally, we solve a speech recognition task for the classification of spoken digits to further demonstrate the potential of covariance-based decoding for real data.",

    "abstract": "Compositional variation among local communities reflects the differences in abiotic environments, though the extent of the influence varies in natural systems. Generally, the environmental filtering is expected to be strong if the environmental gradient encompasses severe habitats where species sorting is highly likely to work. However, this hypothesis has rarely been tested in dynamic systems, where the higher dispersal ability of species allows them to easily respond to stressful environments. Here, with the dynamics of fish communities in a Japanese bay revealed by environmental DNA analyses as a model case, we examined how harmful seasonal hypoxia (low concentration of oxygen in bottom waters in summer) affected the strength of environmental filtering. We found that, in summer, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration was significantly low and fish species richness decreased in the bottom water compared to the surface, suggesting that the organisms were adversely affected by the hypoxia. At the same time, the between-depths heterogeneity in DO concentration was larger, but species composition was less divergent and the influence of DO on species composition appeared weaker during summer. These results imply that environmental filtering is weakened when the bottom water was characterized by extremely severe environments. Furthermore, there was a shift in the species occurrence from bottom to surface waters in summer that was consistent across species, suggesting that the extremely severe hypoxia adversely affected fish species irrespective of their identity. These results collectively suggest that environmental filtering is weaker during summer despite more severity and heterogeneity in environments, most likely because individual movements to avoid unpreferable environments in the bottom waters occurred quasi-neutrally. By providing evidence against the prevailing understanding that environmental filtering strongly works in severe environments, these findings invoke further investigation on how the filtering acts in various conditions.",

    "abstract": "Owing to technological advances in ancient DNA, it is now possible to sequence viruses from the past to track down their origin and evolution. However, ancient DNA data is considerably more degraded and contaminated than modern data making the identification of ancient viral genomes particularly challenging. Several methods to characterise the modern microbiome (and, within this, the virome) have been developed; in particular, tools that assign sequenced reads to specific taxa in order to characterise the organisms present in a sample of interest. While these existing tools are routinely used in modern data, their performance when applied to ancient microbiome data to screen for ancient viruses remains unknown.\n\nIn this work, we conducted an extensive simulation study using public viral sequences to establish which tool is the most suitable to screen ancient samples for human DNA viruses. We compared the performance of four widely used classifiers, namely Centrifuge, Kraken2, DIAMOND and MetaPhlAn2, in correctly assigning sequencing reads to the corresponding viruses. To do so, we simulated reads by adding noise typical of ancient DNA to a set of publicly available human DNA viral sequences and to the human genome. We fragmented the DNA into different lengths, added sequencing error and C to T and G to A deamination substitutions at the read termini. Then we measured the resulting sensitivity and precision for all classifiers.\n\nAcross most simulations, more than 228 out of the 233 simulated viruses are recovered by Centrifuge, Kraken2 and DIAMOND, in contrast to MetaPhlAn2 which recovers only around one third. Overall, Centrifuge and Kraken2 have the best performance with the highest values of sensitivity and precision. We found that deamination damage has little impact on the performance of the classifiers, less than the sequencing error and the length of the reads. Since Centrifuge can handle short reads (in contrast to DIAMOND and Kraken2 with default settings) and since it achieves the highest sensitivity and precision at the species level across all the simulations performed, it is our recommended tool. Regardless of the tool used, our simulations indicate that, for ancient human studies, users should use strict filters to remove all reads of potential human origin. Finally, we recommend to verify which species are present in the database used, as it might happen that default databases lack sequences for viruses of interest.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TE) are mobile genetic parasites whose unregulated activity in the germline causes DNA damage and sterility. While the regulation of TE mobilization by hosts is studied extensively, little is known about mechanisms that could allow germline cells to persist in the face of genotoxic stress imposed by active transposition. Such tolerance mechanisms are predicted to be beneficial when new TEs invade and host repression has not yet evolved. Here we use hybrid dysgenesis--a sterility syndrome of Drosophila caused by transposition of invading DNA transposons--to uncover genetic variants that confer tolerance to transposition. Using a panel of highly recombinant inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster, we identified two linked quantitative trait loci (QTL), that determine tolerance in young and old females, respectively. Through transcriptomic and phenotypic comparisons, we provide evidence that young tolerant females exhibit enhanced repair of double-stranded breaks, explaining their ability to withstand high germline transposition rates. We furthermore identify the germline differentiation factor brat as an independent tolerance factor, whose activity may promote germline maintenance in aging dysgenic females. Together, our work reveals the diversity of potential tolerance mechanisms across development, as well as tolerant variants that may be beneficial in the context of P-element transposition.",

TANGLED1 (TAN1) and AUXIN-INDUCED-IN-ROOT-CULTURES9 (AIR9) are division-site localized microtubule-binding proteins required for division plane positioning. tan1 and air9 Arabidopsis thaliana single mutants have minor or no noticeable phenotypes but the tan1 air9 double mutant has synthetic phenotypes including stunted growth, misoriented divisions, and aberrant cell-file rotation in the root differentiation zone. These data suggest that TAN1 plays a role in nondividing cells.

Unexpectedly, in addition to rescuing division plane defects, pKN:TAN1-YFP rescued root growth and the root differentiation zone cell file rotation defects in the tan1 air9 double mutant. This suggests that defects that occur in the meristematic zone later affect the organization of elongating and differentiating cells.\n\nSummary StatementExpression of TAN1 in the root meristematic zone rescues cell file rotation defects in tan1 air9 mutants, suggesting defects that occur in mitosis may influence organization of nondividing cells.",
