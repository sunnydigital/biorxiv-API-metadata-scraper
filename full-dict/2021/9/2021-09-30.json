    "abstract": "A putative novel methanotrophic genus, Candidatus Methylumidiphilus (Methylococcales), was recently shown to be ubiquitous and one of the most abundant methanotrophic genera in water columns of oxygen-stratified lakes and ponds of boreal and subarctic area. However, it has probably escaped detection in many previous studies using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing due to insufficient database coverage, which is because Ca. Methylumidiphilus lacks cultured representatives and previously analysed metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) affiliated with it do not contain 16S rRNA genes. Therefore, we screened MAGs affiliated with the genus for their 16S rRNA gene sequences in a recently published lake and pond MAG dataset. Among 66 MAGs classified as Ca. Methylumidiphilus (with completeness over 40% and contamination less than 5%) originating from lakes in Finland, Sweden and Switzerland as well as from ponds in Canada, we could find 5 MAGs each containing one 1532 bp long sequence spanning the V1-V9 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. After removal of sequence redundancy, this resulted in two unique 16S rRNA gene sequences. These sequences represented two different putative species, i.e. Ca. Methylumidiphilus alinenensis (Genbank accession: OK236221) as well as another so far unnamed species of Ca. Methylumidiphilus (Genbank accession: OK236220). We suggest that including these two sequences in reference databases will enhance 16S rRNA gene - based detection of members of this genus from environmental samples.",

    "abstract": "Levy flight is a type of random walk that models the behaviour of many phenomena across a multiplicity of academic disciplines; within biology specifically, the behaviour of fish, birds, insects, mollusks, bacteria, plants, slime molds, t-cells, and human populations. The Levy flight foraging hypothesis states that because Levy flights can maximize an organisms search efficiency, natural selection should result in Levy-like behaviour. Empirical and theoretical research has provided ample evidence of Levy walks in both extinct and extant species, and its efficiency across models with a diversity of resource distributions. However, no model has addressed the maintenance of Levy flight foraging through evolutionary processes, and existing models lack ecological breadth. We use numerical simulations, including lineage-based models of evolution with a distribution of move lengths as a variable and heritable trait, to test the Levy flight foraging hypothesis. We include biological and ecological contexts such as population size, searching costs, lifespan, resource distribution, speed, and consider both energy accumulated at the end of a lifespan and averaged over a lifespan. We demonstrate that selection often results in Levy-like behaviour, although conditional; smaller populations, longer searches, and low searching costs increase the fitness of Levy-like behaviour relative to Brownian behaviour. Interestingly, our results also evidence a bet-hedging strategy; Levy-like behaviour reduces fitness variance, thus maximizing geometric mean fitness over multiple generations.\n\nAuthor summaryIn heterotrophs, incuding animals, survival depends on the net energy gained through foraging. The expectation, then, is that natural selection results in adaptations for efficient foraging that optimize the balance of searching costs and rewards. Levy flight foraging has been proposed as an optimal foraging solution. The hypothesis states, if no information about resource locations are available, and the locations are re-visitable, then selection will result in adaptations for Levy flight foraging, a type of random walk. It has been argued that Levy-like foraging behaviour may simply reflect how resources are distributed, but empirical and theoretical research suggests that this behaviour is intrinsic or innate. However, this research does not address evolutionary mechanisms, and lacks ecological breadth. We extend the current theoretical framework by including evolutionary ecological contexts. We treat an organisms random walk as a heritable trait, and explore ecological contexts such as population size, lifespan, carrying capacity, searching costs, reproductive strategies, and different distributions of food. Our evolutionary simulations overwhelmingly resulted in selection for Levy-like foraging, regardless of the distribution of food, and evidences Levy flight foraging as a bet-hedging strategy. Thus, here we provide some of the first evidence for the evolutionary maintenance of Levy flight foraging.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the processes and mechanisms that promote lineage divergence is a central goal in evolutionary biology. For instance, studies investigating the spatial distribution of genomic variation often highlight biogeographic barriers underpinning geographic isolation, as well as patterns of isolation by environment and isolation by distance that can also lead to lineage divergence. However, the patterns and processes that shape genomic variation and drive lineage divergence may be taxa-specific, even across closely related taxa co-occurring within the same biogeographic region. Here, we use molecular data in the form of ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) to infer the evolutionary relationships and population genomic structure of the Eastern Pinesnake complex (Pituophis melanoleucus) - a polytypic wide-ranging species that occupies much of the Eastern Nearctic. In addition to inferring evolutionary relationships, population genomic structure, and gene flow, we also test relationships between genomic diversity and putative barriers to dispersal, environmental variation, and geographic distance. We present results that reveal shallow population genomic structure and ongoing gene flow, despite an extensive geographic range that transcends geographic features found to reduce gene flow among many taxa, including other squamate reptiles within the Eastern Nearctic. Further, our results indicate that the observed genomic diversity is spatially distributed as a pattern of isolation by distance and suggest that the current subspecific taxonomy do not adhere to independent lineages, but rather, show a significant amount of admixture across the entire P. melanoleucus range.",

    "abstract": "The distribution of fitness effects (DFE) for new mutations is fundamental for many aspects of population and quantitative genetics. In this study, we have inferred the DFE in the single-celled alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by estimating changes in the frequencies of 254 spontaneous mutations under experimental evolution and equating the frequency changes of linked mutations with their selection coefficients. We generated seven populations of recombinant haplotypes by crossing seven independently derived mutation accumulation lines carrying an average of 36 mutations in the homozygous state to a mutation-free strain of the same genotype. We then allowed the populations to evolve under natural selection in the laboratory by serial transfer in liquid culture. We observed substantial and repeatable changes in the frequencies of many groups of linked mutations, and, surprisingly, as many mutations were observed to increase as decrease in frequency. We developed a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain method to infer the DFE. This computes the likelihood of the observed distribution of changes of frequency, and obtains the posterior distribution of the selective effects of individual mutations, while assuming a two-sided gamma distribution of effects. We infer that the DFE is a highly leptokurtic distribution, and that approximately equal proportions of mutations have positive and negative effects on fitness. This result is consistent with what we have observed in previous work on a different C. reinhardtii strain, and suggests that a high fraction of new spontaneously arisen mutations are advantageous in a simple laboratory environment.",

    "abstract": "The main factors that determine eye colour are the amount of melanin concentrated in iris melanocytes, as well as the shape and distribution of melanosomes. Eye colour is highly variable in populations with European ancestry, in which eye colour categories cover a continuum of low to high quantities of melanin accumulated in the iris. A few polymorphisms in the HERC2/OCA2 locus in chromosome 15 have the largest effect on eye colour in these populations, although there is evidence of other variants in the locus and across the genome also influencing eye colour. To improve our understanding of the genetic loci determining eye colour, we performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in a Canadian cohort of European ancestry (N= 5,641) and investigated putative causal variants. Our fine-mapping results indicate that there are several candidate causal signals in the HERC2/OCA2 region, whereas other significant loci in the genome likely harbour a single causal signal (TYR, TYRP1, IRF4, SLC24A4). Furthermore, a short subset of the associated eye colour regions was colocalized with the gene expression or methylation profiles of cultured melanocytes (HERC2, OCA2), and transcriptome-wide association studies highlighted the expression of two genes associated with eye colour: SLC24A4 and OCA2. Finally, genetic correlations of eye and hair colour from the same cohort suggest high pleiotropy at the genome level, but locus-level evidence hints at several differences in the genetic architecture of both traits. Overall, we provide a better picture of how polymorphisms modulate eye colour variation, particularly in the HERC2/OCA2 locus, which may be a consequence of specific molecular processes in the iris melanocytes.\n\nAuthor SummaryEye colour differences among humans are the result of different amounts of melanin produced, as well as due to differences in the shape and distribution of the organelles in charge of producing melanin. Eye colour is a highly heritable trait, where several genes across the genome are involved in the process, but we currently do not fully understand which are the causal variants and how they modulate eye colour variation. By performing genome-wide association studies of eye colour across Canadian individuals of European ancestry, we identify several candidate causal signals in and near the gene OCA2, and one candidate signal in other genes, such as TYR, TYRP1, IRF4 and SLC24A4. Furthermore, we provide insights about how significant loci may modulate eye colour variation by testing for shared signals with polymorphisms associated with the expression of genes and DNA methylation. Overall, we provide a better picture of the genetic architecture of eye colour and the molecular mechanisms contributing to its variation.",

Encoding of the bloodmeals was achieved through recombinant DNA-tagged Asaia bacteria that successfully colonized Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes. An arrayed screen of a collection of pesticides showed that chemical classes of avermectins, phenylpyrazoles and neonicotinoids were enriched for compounds with systemic adulticide activity against Anopheles. Using a luminescent Plasmodium falciparum reporter strain, barcoded screens identified 48 drug-like transmission blocking compounds from a 400-compound antimicrobial library.

    "abstract": "Extracellular electron transfer (EET) is an anaerobic respiration process that couples carbon oxidation to the reduction of metal species. In the presence of a suitable metal catalyst, EET allows for cellular metabolism to control a variety of synthetic transformations. Here, we report the use of EET from the model electroactive bacterium Shewanella oneidensis for metabolic and genetic control over Cu(I)-catalyzed Alkyne-Azide Cycloaddition (CuAAC). CuAAC conversion under anaerobic and aerobic conditions was dependent on live, actively respiring S. oneidensis cells. In addition, reaction progress and kinetics could be further manipulated by tailoring the central carbon metabolism of S. oneidensis. Similarly, CuAAC activity was dependent on specific EET pathways and could be manipulated using inducible genetic circuits controlling the expression of EET-relevant proteins including MtrC, MtrA, and CymA. EET-driven CuAAC also exhibited modularity and robustness in ligand tolerance and substrate scope. Furthermore, the living nature of this system could be exploited to perform multiple reaction cycles without requiring regeneration, something inaccessible to traditional chemical reductants. Finally, S. oneidensis enabled bioorthogonal CuAAC membrane labelling on live mammalian cells without affecting cell viability, suggesting that S. oneidensis can act as a dynamically tunable biocatalyst in complex environments. In summary, our results demonstrate how EET can expand the reaction scope available to living systems by enabling cellular control of CuAAC.",

Here, we demonstrate that EVs from mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) can be incorporated into 3D-printed gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel bioink, and that the initial burst release of EVs can be reduced by increasing the concentration of crosslinker during gelation. Further, the data show that MSC EV bioactivity in an endothelial gap closure assay is retained after the 3D printing and photocrosslinking processes. Our group previously showed that MSC EV bioactivity in this assay correlates with pro-angiogenic bioactivity in vivo, thus these results indicate therapeutic potential of MSC EV-laden GelMA bioinks.",

    "abstract": "The development of antibiotic resistance among bacterial strains is a major global public health concern. To address this, drug-free antibacterial approaches are needed. High-touch surfaces in particular can serve as a means for the spread of bacteria and other pathogens from one infected person to another. Copper surfaces have long been known for their antibacterial properties. To further enhance the surfaces antibacterial properties, we used a one-step surface modification technique to assemble 2D copper chloride nanoplatelets directly onto copper surfaces such as copper tape, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grids, electrodes, and granules. The nanoplatelets were formed using copper ions from the copper surfaces, enabling their direct assembly onto these surfaces in a one-step process that does not require separate nanoparticle synthesis. The synthesis of the nanoplatelets was confirmed with TEM, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Antibacterial properties of the surfaces with copper chloride nanoplatelets were demonstrated in multi-drug-resistant (MDR) E. coli. The presence of copper chloride nanoplatelets on the surface led to a marked improvement in antibacterial properties compared to the untreated copper surfaces. Surfaces with copper chloride nanoplatelets affected bacterial cell morphology, prevented bacterial cell division, reduced their viability, damaged bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and altered protein expression. In particular, proteins corresponding to cell division, DNA division, and mediation of copper toxicity were down-regulated. This work presents a robust method to directly assemble copper chloride nanoplatelets onto any copper surface to imbue it with improved antibacterial properties. To demonstrate that our method of particle generation can be used with other metal surfaces, we also demonstrate the synthesis of other metal-derived nanoarchitectures on a variety of metal surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Engineering peptides to achieve a desired therapeutic effect through the inhibition of a specific target activity or protein interaction is a non-trivial task. Few of the existing in silico peptide design algorithms generate target-specific peptides. Instead, many methods produce peptides that achieve a desired effect through an unknown mechanism. In contrast with resource-intensive high-throughput experiments, in silico screening is a cost-effective alternative that can prune the space of candidates when engineering target-specific peptides. Using a set of FDA-approved peptides we curated specifically for this task, we assess the applicability of several sequence-based protein-protein interaction predictors as a screening tool within the context of peptide therapeutic engineering. We show that similarity-based protein-protein interaction predictors are more suitable for this purpose than the state-of-the-art deep learning methods publicly available at the time of writing. We also show that this approach is mostly useful when designing new peptides against targets for which naturally-occurring interactors are already known, and that deploying it for de novo peptide engineering tasks may require gathering additional target-specific training data. Taken together, this work offers evidence that supports the use of similarity-based protein-protein interaction predictors for peptide therapeutic engineering, especially peptide analogs.",

    "abstract": "Lipid rafts are known as highly ordered lipid domains that are enriched in saturated lipids such as the ganglioside GM1. While lipid rafts are believed to exist in cells and to serve as signaling platforms through their enrichment in signaling components, they have never been directly observed in the plasma membrane without treatments that artificially cluster GM1 into large lattices. Here we report that microscopic GM1-enriched domains can form, without lipid cross-linking, in the plasma membrane of live mammalian cells expressing the EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase in response to its ligand ephrinA1-Fc. The GM1-enriched microdomains form concomitantly with EphA2-enriched microdomains, but only partially co-localize with them. To gain insight into how plasma membrane heterogeneity controls signaling, we quantify the degree of EphA2 segregation and study initial EphA2 signaling steps in both EphA2-enriched and EphA2-depleted domains. By measuring dissociation constants, we demonstrate that EphA2 oligomerization is the same in EphA2-enriched and -depleted domains. However, EphA2 interacts preferentially with its downstream effector SRC in EphA2-depleted domains. The ability to induce microscopic GM1-enriched domains in live cells using a ligand for a transmembrane receptor will give us unprecedented opportunities to study the biology of lipid rafts.",

Such a scar also has a border zone around it, which has electrophysiological properties different from the rest of normal myocardial tissue. Spatial patterns of wave rotation in the presence of such tissue heterogeneity are poorly studied. In this paper we perform a comprehensive numerical study of various regimes of rotation of a wave in a plane layer of the ventricular tissue around an obstacle surrounded by a gray zone. We use a TP06 cellular ionic model which reproduces the electrophysiological properties of cardiomyocytes in the left ventricle of human heart. We vary the extent of obstacle and gray zone and study the pattern of wave rotation and its period. We observed different regimes of wave rotation that can be subdivided into several classes: (1) functional rotation and (2) scar rotation regimes, which were identified in the previous studies, and new (3) gray zone rotation regime: where the wave instead of rotation around the obstacle, rotates around the gray zone (an area of tissue heterogeneity) itself. For each class, the period of rotation is determined by different factors, which we discuss and quantify. We also found that due to regional pathological remodeling of myocardial tissue, we can obtain additional regimes associated with dynamical instabilities of two types which may affect or not affect the period of rotation.",

    "abstract": "AimsEnhanced nitrogen (N) and water uptake from deep soil layers may increase resource use efficiency whilst maintaining yield under stressed conditions. Winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) can develop deep roots and access deep-stored resources such as N and water, while this potential has large uncertainties in variable environments. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of reduced N and water supply on deep N and water uptake.\n\nMethodsOilseed rape plants grown in outdoor rhizotrons were supplied with 240 and 80 kg N ha-1 respectively in 2019 whereas a well-watered and a water-deficit treatment were established in 2020. To track deep water and N uptake, a mixture of 2H2O and Ca(15NO3)2 was injected into the soil column at 0.5 and 1.7 m depths. {delta}2H in transpiration water and {delta}15N in leaves were measured after injection. {delta}15N in biomass samples were also measured.\n\nResultsDifferences in N or water supply had little effect on root growth. The low N treatment reduced water uptake throughout the soil profile, but caused a non-significant increment in 15N uptake efficiency at both 0.5 and 1.7 m. Water deficit in the upper soil layers led to compensatory deep water, while N uptake was not altered by soil water status.\n\nConclusionOur findings demonstrate that for winter oilseed rape, high N application and water deficiency in shallow layers increases deep water uptake, and that the efficiency of deep N uptake is mainly sensitive to N supply rather than water supply.",

    "abstract": "Multisensory integration enables stimulus representation even when the sensory input in a single modality is weak. In the context of speech, when confronted with a degraded acoustic signal, congruent visual inputs promote comprehension. When this input is occluded speech comprehension consequently becomes more difficult. But it still remains inconclusive which levels of speech processing are affected under which circumstances by occlusion of the mouth area. To answer this question, we conducted an audiovisual (AV) multi-speaker experiment using naturalistic speech. In half of the trials, the target speaker wore a (surgical) face mask, while we measured the brain activity of normal hearing participants via magnetoencephalography (MEG). We additionally added a distractor speaker in half of the trials in order to create an ecologic difficult listening situation. A decoding model on the clear AV speech was trained and used to reconstruct crucial speech features in each condition. We found significant main effects of face masks on the reconstruction of acoustic features, such as the speech envelope and spectral speech features (i.e. pitch and formant frequencies), while reconstruction of higher level features of speech segmentation (phoneme and word onsets) were especially impaired through masks in difficult listening situations. As we used surgical face masks in our study, which only show mild effects on speech acoustics, we interpret our findings as the result of the occluded lip movements. This idea is in line with recent research showing that visual cortical regions track spectral modulations. Our findings extend previous behavioural results, by demonstrating the complex contextual effects of occluding relevant visual information on speech processing.\n\nHighlightsO_LISurgical face masks impair neural tracking of speech features\nC_LIO_LITracking of acoustic features is generally impaired, while higher level segmentational features show their effects especially in challenging listening situations\nC_LIO_LIAn explanation is the prevention of a visuo-phonological transformation contributing to audiovisual multisensory integration\nC_LI",

Other studies have examined sensorimotor rhythm changes (also known as  suppression) as a valuable indicator of successful execution of the MI task. This research aims to combine these insights by investigating whether cognitive factors and personality traits can make predictions of a users ability to modulate  rhythms during a MI-BCI task. Data containing 55 subjects who completed a MI task was employed, and a stepwise linear regression model was implemented to select the most relevant features for  suppression prediction. The most accurate model was based on these factors: Spatial Ability, Visuospatial Memory, Autonomy, and Vividness of Visual Imagery.

    "abstract": "Spastic cerebral palsy (CP) is a movement disorder marked by hypertonia and hyperreflexia, and the most prevalent comorbidity is pain. Since spinal nociceptive afferents contribute to both the sensation of painful stimuli as well as reflex circuits involved in movement, we investigated the relationship between prenatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) injury which can cause CP, and possible changes in spinal nociceptive circuitry. To do this, we examined nociceptive afferents and mechanical and thermal sensitivity of New Zealand White rabbit kits after prenatal HI or a sham surgical procedure. As described previously, a range of motor deficits similar to spastic CP was observed in kits born naturally after HI (40 minutes at [~]70-80% gestation). We found that HI caused an expansion of peptidergic afferents (marked by expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide; CGRP) in both the superficial and deep dorsal horn at postnatal day (P)5. Non-peptidergic nociceptive afferent arborization (labeled by isolectin B4; IB4) was unaltered in HI kits but overlap of the two populations (peptidergic and non-peptidergic nociceptors) was increased by HI. Density of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was unchanged within spinal white matter regions important in nociceptive transmission at P5. We found that mechanical and thermal nociception was enhanced in HI kits even in the absence of motor deficits. These findings suggest that prenatal HI injury impacts spinal sensory pathways in addition to the more well-established disruptions to descending motor circuits. In conclusion, changes to spinal nociceptive circuitry could disrupt spinalreflexes and contribute to pain experienced by individuals with CP.\n\nSignificance StatementPerinatal injuries that cause cerebral palsy (CP) typically involve global insults to the central nervous system and are capable of modulating development of both motor and sensory systems. Most individuals with CP experience pain, yet whether nociception is enhanced in this disorder is unexplored. Here, we demonstrate altered topographic distribution of nociceptive afferents in the spinal cord dorsal horn of neonatal rabbits that experienced hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury in utero; these anatomical changes were associated with nocifensive behavior indicative of pain-like behaviors. Our findings suggest that CP-causative injuries alter spinal sensory pathways (not only descending motor circuits), contributing to increased pain in CP.",

    "abstract": "The brain actively reshapes our understanding of past events in light of new incoming information. In the current study, we ask how the brain supports this updating process during the encoding and recall of naturalistic stimuli. One group of participants watched a movie (\"The Sixth Sense\") with a cinematic \"twist\" at the end that dramatically changed the interpretation of previous events. Next, participants were asked to verbally recall the movie events, taking into account the new \"twist\" information. Most participants updated their recall to incorporate the twist. Two additional groups recalled the movie without having to update their memories during recall: one group never saw the twist; another group was exposed to the twist prior to the beginning of the movie, and thus the twist information was incorporated both during encoding and recall. We found that providing participants with information about the twist beforehand altered neural response patterns during movie-viewing in the default mode network (DMN). Moreover, presenting participants with the twist at the end of the movie changed the neural representation of the previously-encoded information during recall in a subset of DMN regions. Further evidence for this transformation was obtained by comparing the neural activation patterns during encoding and recall and correlating them with behavioral signatures of memory updating. Our results demonstrate that neural representations of past events encoded in the DMN are dynamically integrated with new information that reshapes our understanding in natural contexts.",

Here we show that Neurofibromin-1 (Nf1) is not required in muscle fibers, but specifically in early postnatal myogenic progenitors (MPs), where Nf1 loss led to cell cycle exit and differentiation blockade, depleting the MP pool resulting in reduced myonuclear accrual as well as reduced muscle stem cell numbers. This was caused by precocious induction of stem cell quiescence coupled to metabolic reprogramming of MPs impinging on glycolytic shutdown, which was conserved in muscle fibers. We show that a Mek/Erk/NOS pathway hypersensitizes Nf1-deficient MPs to Notch signaling, consequently, early postnatal Notch pathway inhibition ameliorated premature quiescence, metabolic reprogramming and muscle growth. This reveals an unexpected role of Ras/Mek/Erk signaling supporting postnatal MP quiescence in concert with Notch signaling, which is controlled by Nf1 safeguarding coordinated muscle growth and muscle stem cell pool establishment. Furthermore, our data suggest transmission of metabolic reprogramming across cellular differentiation, affecting fiber metabolism and function in NF1.",

We analyzed AIV genomic sequences from North American wild birds, including 303 newly sequenced isolates, to estimate interspecies transmission and geographic diffusion patterns among multiple co-circulating subtypes. Our results show high transition rates within Anseriformes and Charadriiformes, but limited transitions between these orders. Patterns of interspecies transmission were positively associated with breeding habitat range overlap, and negatively associated with host genetic distance. Distance between regions (negative correlation) and summer temperature at origin (positive correlation) were strong predictors of diffusion. Taken together, this study demonstrates that host diversity and ecology can determine evolutionary processes that underlie AIV natural history and spread. Understanding these processes can provide important insights for effective control of AIV.",

Here, we investigate the iab-8 ncRNA from the Drosophila Bithorax Complex and show that this RNA is able to repress the transcription of genes located at its 3 end by a sequence-independent, transcriptional interference mechanism. Although this RNA is expressed in the early epidermis and CNS, we find that its repressive activity is limited to the CNS, where in wild-type embryos, it acts on the Hox gene, abd-A located immediately downstream of it. The CNS specificity is achieved through a 3 extension of the transcript, mediated by the neuronal-specific, RNA-binding protein, ELAV. Loss of ELAV activity eliminates the 3 extension and results in the ectopic activation of abd-A. Thus, a tissue-specific change in the length of a ncRNA is used to generate a precise pattern of gene expression in a higher eukaryote.",

    "abstract": "Despite increasing data from population-wide sequencing studies, the risk for recessive disorders in consanguineous partnerships is still heavily debated. An important aspect that has not sufficiently been investigated theoretically, is the influence of inbreeding on mutation load and incidence rates when the population sizes change. We therefore developed a model to study these dynamics for a wide range of growth and mating conditions. In the phase of population expansion and shortly afterwards, our simulations show that there is a drop of diseased individuals at the expense of an increasing mutation load for random mating, while both parameters remain almost constant in highly consanguineous partnerships. This explains the empirical observation in present times that a high degree of consanguinity is associated with an increased risk of autosomal recessive disorders. However, it also states that the higher frequency of severe recessive disorders with developmental delay in inbred populations is a transient phenomenon before a mutation-selection balance is reached again.\n\nAuthor summaryWhat determines the recessive disease burden? The empirical observation that the proportion of intellectual disability of autosomal recessive cause is usually higher in offspring of consanguineous partnerships may lead to a misunderstanding about the mechanisms at work. In any population, selection removes pathogenic alleles from the gene pool while the de novo mutation rate adds novel pathogenic alleles. For comparable mutation rates, the incidence of severe recessive disease should be comparable in mutation-selection balance, regardless of the mating scheme. Different incidences can therefore only be explained by population dynamics that are not in equilibrium. We studied in simulated populations the time scales in which mutation-selection balance is reached after a growth phase and found that the mating scheme has a big impact on this lag time. When cousins mate preferentially with cousins, a few generations after a ten-fold increase in size the new equilibrium is established. In contrast, for random-mating, the transient advantage of a lower incidence may last for hundreds of generations, while the mutation load increases. By this means, our findings also highlight the importance of better carrier screens in the future for genetic consultations.",

    "abstract": "Although estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer is generally associated with favorable prognosis, clinical outcome varies substantially among patients. Genomic assays have been developed and applied to predict patient prognosis for personalized treatment. We hypothesize that the recurrence risk of ER+ breast cancer patients is determined by both genomic mutations intrinsic to tumor cells and extrinsic immunological features in the tumor microenvironment. Based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer data, we identified the 72 most common genomic aberrations (including gene mutations and indels) in ER+ breast cancer and defined sample-specific scores that systematically characterized the deregulated pathways intrinsic to tumor cells. To further consider tumor cell extrinsic features, we calculated immune infiltration scores for six major immune cell types. Many individual intrinsic features are predictive of patient prognosis in ER+ breast cancer, and some of them achieved comparable accuracy with the Oncotype DX assay. In addition, statistical learning models that integrated these features predicts the recurrence risk of patients with significantly better performance than the Oncotype DX assay. As a proof-of-concept, our study indicates the great potential of genomic and immunological features in prognostic prediction for improving breast cancer precision medicine. The framework introduced in this work can be readily applied to other cancers.\n\nAuthor SummaryMany genomic biomarker tests such as Oncotype DX have been developed for breast cancer and have helped guide clinical decisions. We have developed gene signatures to integrate cancer genomic and transcriptomic data to characterize the downstream effect of driver genomic events. These signatures recapitulate the de-regulated pathways underlying the corresponding driver genomic events and are more correlated with clinical phenotypes such as recurrence free survival than mutation status alone. We apply this framework to ER+ breast cancer and define gene signatures for a total of 72 most commonly observed genomic events including gene mutations, amplifications and deletions. We find that many of these gene signatures are predictive of patient prognosis in ER+ breast cancer, and some of them achieved comparable accuracy with the Oncotype DX assay. We combine these tumor-intrinsic signatures with infiltration signatures for major immune cell types (tumor-extrinsic features) to construct integrative models for prognosis prediction. The models predicts the recurrence risk of patients with significantly better performance than the Oncotype DX assay.",

While precise assessment of microvascular ED could thus be used for the early detection and risk stratification of CVD, detailed interrogation of skin microvascular ED is limited by the technology available. Herein, we applied a novel approach for the non-invasive assessment of skin microvascular ED by developing fast plane raster-scan optoacoustic mesoscopy (FP-RSOM) to visualize and quantify skin microvasculature perfusion changes during post-occlusive hyperemia (PORH) tests. We combined static three-dimensional RSOM imaging with fast dynamic FP-RSOM measurements (1 frame / second) in human skin in vivo, which allowed for the first time to fully visualize the cutaneous microvascular response and further quantify changes of individual vessel diameter, total blood volume and vessel density during the PORH process. We further computed biomarkers from FP-RSOM images to quantify skin endothelial function within different skin layers as a function of skin depth, while conventional approaches mainly measure overall changes within sampled tissue volumes. FP-RSOM applied on smokers and patients with CVD showed clear ED in both groups compared to healthy volunteers. Moreover, FP-RSOM imaging showed higher sensitivity in quantifying the effects of smoking and CVD on skin microvascular endothelial function compared to clinically used laser Doppler flowmetry and tissue spectrometry (O2C). Our study introduces FP-RSOM as a novel tool to visualize and quantify skin microvascular ED as an early marker for the diagnostics and monitoring of cardiovascular risk and disease.",

    "abstract": "Statistical inference and machine learning methods are benchmarked on test data independent of the data used to train the method. Biological sequence families are highly non-independent because they are related by evolution, so the strategy for splitting data into separate training and test sets is a nontrivial choice in benchmarking sequence analysis methods. A random split is insufficient because it will yield test sequences that are closely related or even identical to training sequences. Adapting ideas from independent set graph algorithms, we describe two new methods for splitting sequence data into dissimilar training and test sets. These algorithms input a sequence family and produce a split in which each test sequence is less than p% identical to any individual training sequence. These algorithms successfully split more families than a previous approach, enabling construction of more diverse benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "Storing and manipulating Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) file formats is an essential but difficult task in biological data analysis. The easyfm (easy file manipulation) toolkit (https://github.com/TaekAndBrendan/easyfm) makes manipulating commonly used NGS files more accessible to biologists. It enables them to perform end-to-end reproducible data analyses using a free standalone desktop application (available on Windows, Mac and Linux). Unlike existing tools (e.g. Galaxy), the Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based easyfm is not dependent on any high-performance computing (HPC) system and can be operated without an internet connection. This specific benefit allow easyfm to seamlessly integrate visual and interactive representations of NGS files, supporting a wider scope of bioinformatics applications in the life sciences.\n\nAuthor summaryThe analysis and manipulation of NGS data for understanding biological phenomena is an increasingly important aspect in the life sciences. Yet, most methods for analysing, storing and manipulating NGS data require complex command-line tools in HPC or web-based servers and have not yet been implemented in comprehensive, easy-to-use software. This is a major hurdle preventing more general application in the field of NGS data analysis and file manipulation. Here we present easyfm, a free standalone Graphical User Interface (GUI) software with Python support that can be used to facilitate the rapid discovery of target sequences (or users interest) in NGS datasets for novice users. For user-friendliness and convenience, easyfm was developed with four work modules and a secondary GUI window (herein secondary window), covering different aspects of NGS data analysis (mainly focusing on FASTA files), including post-processing, filtering, format conversion, generating results, real-time log, and help. In combination with the executable tools (BLAST+ and BLAT) and Python, easyfm allows the user to set analysis parameters, select/extract regions of interest, examine the input and output results, and convert to a wide range of file formats. To help augment the functionality of existing web-based and command-line tools, easyfm, a self-contained program, comes with extensive documentation (hosted at https://github.com/TaekAndBrendan/easyfm) including a comprehensive step-by-step guide.",

Among antibiotics, doxycycline-hyclate kills a wide range of bacteria.

Then, one of the four formulations with the most appropriate particle size of 362.88 {+/-} 13.05 nm to target the follicles, percentage of drug entrapment efficiency of 56.3 {+/-} 2.1%, in vitro drug release of 54.93 {+/-} 1.99% after 32 hours, and the lowest permeation of the drug through the Wistar rat skin, was selected. Then, its toxicity on human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) by MTT method after 72 hours, its antibacterial activity against the main acne-causing bacteria via antibiogram test, and its effect on Wistar rat skin drug deposition were measured. Improved cell viability, increased antibacterial activity, and an approximately three-fold increase in drug deposition were the optimal niosomal formulation features relative to the free drug.

    "abstract": "Members of the NETWORKED (NET) family are involved in actin-membrane interactions. They tether the cells plasma membrane (PM) to the actin network. Moreover, in a similar manner, they are also involved in the tethering of membrane bound organelles to the actin cytoskeleton; the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ER to the PM. This raises the question as to whether NET proteins are involved in actin cytoskeletal remodelling. Here we show that two members of the NET family, NET4A and NET4B, are essential for normal guard cell actin reorganization, which is a process critical for stomatal closure in plant immunity. NET4 proteins interact with F-actin and with members of the Rab7 GTPase RABG3 family through two distinct domains, allowing for simultaneous localization to actin filaments and the tonoplast. NET4 proteins interact with GTP-bound, active RABG3 members, suggesting their function as downstream effectors. We also show that RABG3b is critical for stomatal closure induced by microbial patterns. Taken together, we conclude that the actin cytoskeletal remodelling during stomatal closure depends on a molecular link between actin filaments and the tonoplast, which is mediated by the NET4-RABG3b interaction. We propose that stomatal closure to microbial patterns involves the coordinated action of immune signalling events and proper actin cytoskeletal remodelling.",

    "abstract": "Woody biomass is an important feedstock for biofuel production. Manipulation of wood properties that enable efficient conversion of biomass to biofuel reduces cost of biofuel production. Wood cell wall composition is regulated at several levels that involve expression of transcription factors such as wood-/secondary cell wall-associated NAC domains (WND or SND). In Arabidopsis thaliana, SND1 regulates cell wall composition through activation of its down-stream targets such as MYBs. The functional aspects of SND1 homologs in the woody Populus have been studied through transgenic manipulation. In this study, we investigated the role of PdWND1B, Populus SND1 sequence ortholog, in wood formation using transgenic manipulation through over-expression or silencing under the control of a vascular-specific 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL) promoter. As compared to control plants, PdWND1B-RNAi plants were shorter in height, with significantly reduced stem diameter and dry biomass, whereas there were no significant differences in growth and productivity of PdWND1B over-expression plants. Conversely, PdWND1B over-expression lines showed a significant reduction in cellulose and increase in lignin content, whereas there was no significant impact on lignin content of down-regulated lines. Stem carbohydrate composition analysis revealed a decrease in glucose, mannose, arabinose, and galactose, but an increase in xylose in the over-expression lines. Transcriptome analysis revealed upregulation of several downstream transcription factors and secondary cell wall related structural genes in the PdWND1B over-expression lines that corresponded to significant phenotypic changes in cell wall chemistry observed in PdWND1B overexpression lines. Relative to the control, glucose release and ethanol production from stem biomass was significantly reduced in over-expression lines but appeared enhanced in the RNAi lines. Our results show that PdWND1B is an important factor determining biomass productivity, cell wall chemistry and its conversion to biofuels in Populus.",

    "abstract": "Vision provides the most important sensory information for spatial navigation. Recent technical advances allow new options to conduct more naturalistic experiments in virtual reality (VR) while additionally gather data of the viewing behavior with eye tracking investigations. Here, we propose a method that allows one to quantify characteristics of visual behavior by using graph-theoretical measures to abstract eye tracking data recorded in a 3D virtual urban environment.\n\nThe analysis is based on eye tracking data of 20 participants, who freely explored the virtual city Seahaven for 90 minutes with an immersive VR headset with an inbuild eye tracker. To extract what participants looked at, we defined \"gaze\" events, from which we created gaze graphs. On these, we applied graph-theoretical measures to reveal the underlying structure of visual attention.\n\nApplying graph partitioning, we found that our virtual environment could be treated as one coherent city. To investigate the importance of houses in the city, we applied the node degree centrality measure. Our results revealed that 10 houses had a node degree that exceeded consistently two-sigma distance from the mean node degree of all other houses. The importance of these houses was supported by the hierarchy index, which showed a clear hierarchical structure of the gaze graphs. As these high node degree houses fulfilled several characteristics of landmarks, we named them \"gaze-graph-defined landmarks\". Applying the rich club coefficient, we found that these gaze-graph-defined landmarks were preferentially connected to each other and that participants spend the majority of their experiment time in areas where at least two of those houses were visible.\n\nOur findings do not only provide new experimental evidence for the development of spatial knowledge, but also establish a new methodology to identify and assess the function of landmarks in spatial navigation based on eye tracking data.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe ability to navigate and orient ourselves in an unknown environment is important in everyday life. To better understand how we are able to learn about a new environment, it is important to study our behavior during the process of spatial navigation. New technical advances allow us to conduct studies in naturalistic virtual environments with participants wearing immersive VR-headsets. In addition, we can use eye trackers to observe the participants eye movements. This is interesting, because observing eye movements allows us to observe visual attention and, therefore, important cognitive processes. However, it can be difficult to analyze eye tracking data that was measured in a VR environment, as there is no established algorithm yet. Therefore, we propose a new method to analyze such eye tracking data. In addition, our method allows us to transform the eye tracking data into graphs which we can use to find new patterns in behavior that were not accessible before. Using this methodology, we found that participants who spend 90 min exploring a new virtual town, viewed some houses preferentially and we call them gaze-graph-defined landmarks. Our further analysis reveals also new characteristics of those houses that were not yet associated with landmarks.",

    "abstract": "Self-motion produces characteristic patterns of optic flow on the eye of the mobile observer. Movement along linear, straight paths without eye movements yields motion that radiates from the direction of travel (heading). The observer experiences more complex motion patterns while moving along more general curvilinear (e.g. circular) paths, the appearance of which depends on the radius of the curved path (path curvature) and the direction of gaze. Neurons in brain area MSTd of primate visual cortex exhibit tuning to radial motion patterns and have been linked with linear heading perception. MSTd also contains neurons that exhibit tuning to spirals, but their function is not well understood. We investigated in a computational model whether MSTd, through its diverse pattern tuning, could support estimation of a broader range of self-motion parameters from optic flow than has been previously demonstrated. We used deep learning to decode these parameters from signals produced by neurons tuned to radial expansion, spiral, ground flow, and other patterns in a mechanistic neural model of MSTd. Specifically, we found that we could accurately decode the clockwise/counterclockwise sign of curvilinear path and the gaze direction relative to the path tangent from spiral cells; heading from radial cells; and the curvature (radius) of the curvilinear path from activation produced by both radial and spiral populations. We demonstrate accurate decoding of these linear and curvilinear self-motion parameters in both synthetic and naturalistic videos of simulated self-motion. Estimates remained stable over time, while also rapidly adapting to dynamic changes in the observers curvilinear self-motion. Our findings suggest that specific populations of neurons in MSTd could effectively signal important aspects of the observers linear and curvilinear self-motion.\n\nAuthor SummaryHow do we perceive our self-motion as we move through the world? Substantial evidence indicates that brain area MSTd contains neurons that signal the direction of travel during movement along straight paths. We wondered whether MSTd neurons could also estimate more general self-motion along curved paths. We tested this idea by using deep learning to decode signals produced by a neural model of MSTd. The system accurately decoded parameters that specify the observers self-motion along straight and curved paths in videos of synthetic and naturalistic scenes rendered in the Unreal game engine. Our findings suggest that MSTd could jointly signal self-motion along straight and curved paths.",

Here we identify the trafficking adaptor protein Numb as an essential regulator of Tau homeostasis. Conditional inactivation of Numb in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) increases monomeric and oligomeric Tau levels, leading to axonal blebbing followed by neuronal cell loss in aged mice. Moreover, in a mouse model of tauopathy, inactivation of Numb in RGCs and spinal motoneurons accelerates neurodegeneration, and leads to precocious hindlimb paralysis. Conversely, overexpression of the long isoform of Numb (Numb-72), but not other isoforms, decreases intracellular Tau levels by promoting the extracellular release of monomeric Tau, and AAV-mediated delivery of Numb-72 in RGCs in vivo prevents neurodegeneration in two different mouse models of tauopathy. Taken together, these results uncover Numb as a modulator of intracellular Tau levels and identify Numb-72 as a novel therapeutic factor for tauopathies.",

    "abstract": "The exact mechanism behind general anesthesia remains an open question in neuroscience. It has been proposed that anesthetics selectively prevent consciousness and memory via acting on microtubules (MTs). It is known that the magnetic field modulates MT organization. A recent study shows that a radical pair model can explain the isotope effect in xenon-induced anesthesia and predicts magnetic field effects on anesthetic potency. Further, reactive oxygen species are also implicated in MT stability and anesthesia. Based on a simple radical pair mechanism model and a simple mathematical model of MT organization, we show that magnetic fields can modulate spin dynamics of naturally occurring radical pairs in MT. We show that the spin dynamics influence a rate in the reaction cycle, which translates into a change in the MT density. We can reproduce magnetic field effects on the MT concentration that have been observed. Our model also predicts additional effects at slightly higher fields. Our model further predicts that the effect of zinc on the MT density exhibits isotopic dependence. The findings of this work make a connection between microtubule-based and radical pair-based quantum theories of consciousness.",

Here, we ask whether decision-makers are also influenced by how advice from other knowledgeable agents are framed, a \"social framing effect\". For example, do students learn better from a teacher who often frames advice by emphasizing appetitive outcomes, or do they learn better from another teacher who usually emphasizes avoiding options that can be harmful to their progress? We study the computational and neural mechanisms by which framing of advice affect decision-making, social learning, and trust. We found that human participants are more likely to trust and follow an adviser who often uses an appetitive frame for advice compared with another one who often uses an aversive frame. This social framing effect is implemented through a modulation of the integrative abilities of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. At the time of choice, this region combines information learned via personal experiences of reward with social information, but the combination differs depending on the social framing of advice. Personally-acquired information is weighted more strongly when dealing with an adviser who uses an aversive frame. The findings suggest that social advice is systematically incorporated into our decisions, while being affected by biases similar to those influencing individual value-based learning.",

    "abstract": "Human actions led to the worldwide decline of marine mammal populations in the 18th-19th centuries. However, the global uptake in protective legislation during the 20th century has recently allowed many marine mammal populations to recover. This positive trend is particularly true of pinnipeds (e.g., seals and sea lions), whose recovering populations are increasingly in conflict with fisheries. Many fisheries organisations call for managed culls of sea lion populations to reduce competition for target fish species as well as damage to catch and fishing gear through operational interactions. However, despite widespread perceptions that sea lion populations are generally increasing, to-date culls have been considered or implemented without quantitative evidence of their impacts on seal lion population viability. This knowledge gap is particularly concerning given the expected increase in extreme climate conditions, such as extreme El Nino events, which together with culls could push sea lion populations in some parts of the world into the extinction vortex. In this analysis, I develop and parameterise stochastic matrix population models of the South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) to project the impact of (1) three cull scenarios with different intensity and temporal frequency targeting adult females, (2) extreme El Nino events whose frequency is modelled using a Markovian transition matrix, (3) and the interaction of culls and extreme climate events on population dynamics. I focus on the Chilean population of O. flavescens, where recent increases in sea lion numbers have triggered widespread conflict with small-scale fisheries, and where sea lion populations will increasingly be affected by extreme El Nino conditions. I find that sea lion populations decline below minimum viable population sizes under all scenarios involving culls and extreme climate events. By explicitly considering parameter uncertainty, this approach is a call to action for future research to focus on collecting stage-specific, annual population data to reduce uncertainty regarding marine mammal vital rates.",

    "abstract": "Identifying accessible chromatin regions is a fundamental problem in epigenomics with ATAC-seq being a commonly used assay. Exponential rise in single cell ATAC-seq experiments has made it critical to accelerate processing of ATAC-seq data. ATAC-seq data can have a low signal-to-noise ratio for various reasons including low coverage or low cell count. To denoise and identify accessible chromatin regions from noisy ATAC-seq data, use of deep learning on 1D data - using large filter sizes, long tensor widths, and/or dilation - has recently been proposed. Here, we present ways to accelerate the end-to-end training performance of these deep learning based methods using CPUs. We evaluate our approach on the recently released AtacWorks toolkit. Compared to an Nvidia DGX-1 box with 8 V100 GPUs, we get up to 2.27x speedup using just 16 CPU sockets. To achieve this, we build an efficient 1D dilated convolution layer and demonstrate reduced precision (BFloat16) training.",

    "abstract": "Following decades of insights from structure-function studies, there is now a need to progress from a static to dynamic view of enzymes. Comparison of prior cryo X-ray structures suggested that deleterious effects from ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) mutants arise from misalignment of the oxyanion hole catalytic residue, Y16. However, multi-conformer models from room temperature X-ray diffraction revealed an ensemble of Y16 conformers indistinguishable from WT for Y32F/Y57F KSI and a distinct, non-native ensemble for Y16 in Y57F KSI. Functional analyses suggested rate effects arise from weakened hydrogen bonding, due to disruption of the Y16/Y57/Y32 hydrogen bond network, and repositioning of the general base. In general, catalytic changes can be deconvoluted into effects on the probability of occupying a state (P-effects) and the reactivity of each state (k-effects). Our results underscore the need for ensemble-function analysis to decipher enzyme function and ultimately manipulate their extraordinary capabilities.",

    "abstract": "The external environment is a regulator of cell activity. Its stiffness and microstructure can either facilitate or prevent 3D cell migration in both physiology and disease. 3D cell migration results from force feedbacks between the cell and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Adhesions regulate these force feedbacks by working as molecular clutches that dynamically bind and unbind the ECM. Because of the interdependency between ECM properties, adhesion dynamics, and cell contractility, how exactly 3D cell migration occurs in different environments is not fully understood. In order to elucidate the effect of ECM on 3D cell migration through force-sensitive molecular clutches, we developed a computational model based on a lattice point approach. Results from the model show that increases in ECM pore size reduce cell migration speed. In contrast, matrix porosity increases it, given a sufficient number of ligands for cell adhesions and limited crowding of the matrix from cell replication. Importantly, these effects are maintained across a range of ECM stiffnesses, demonstrating that mechanical factors are not responsible for how matrix microstructure regulates cell motility.",

    "abstract": "Biological membrane is a complex self-assembly of lipids, sterols and proteins organized as a fluid bilayer of two closely stacked lipid leaflets. Differential molecular interactions among its diverse constituents give rise to heterogeneities in the membrane lateral organization. Under certain conditions, heterogeneities in the two leaflets can be spatially synchronised and exist as registered domains across the bilayer. Several contrasting theories behind mechanisms that induce registration of nanoscale domains have been suggested[1-3]. Following a recent study[4] showing the effect of position of lipid tail unsaturation on domain registration behavior, we decided to develop an analytical theory to elucidate the driving forces that create and maintain domain registry across leaflets. Towards this, we formulated a Hamiltonian for a stacked lattice system where site variables capture the lipid molecular properties such as the position of unsaturation and various other interactions that could drive phase separation and interleaflet coupling. We solve the Hamiltonian using Monte Carlo simulations and create a complete phase diagram that reports the presence or absence of registered domains as a function of various Hamiltonian parameters. We find that the interleaflet coupling should be described as a competing enthalpic contribution due to interaction of lipid tail termini, primarily due to saturated-saturated interactions, and an interleaflet entropic contribution from overlap of unsaturated tail termini. A higher position of unsaturation is seen to provide weaker interleaflet coupling. Thermodynamically stable nanodomains could also be observed for certain points in the parameter space in our bilayer model, which were further verified by carrying out extended Monte Carlo simulations. These persistent non-coalescing registered nanodomains close to the lower end of the accepted nanodomain size range also point towards a possible \"nanoscale\" emulsion description of lateral heterogeneities in biological membrane leaflets.",

    "abstract": "There are currently relatively few small-molecule antiviral drugs that are either approved or emergency approved for use against SARS-CoV-2. One of these is remdesivir, which was originally repurposed from its use against Ebola and functions by causing early RNA chain termination. We used this as justification to evaluate three molecules we had previously identified computationally with antiviral activity against Ebola and Marburg. Out of these we previously identified pyronaridine, which inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 replication in A549-ACE2 cells. Herein, the in vivo efficacy of pyronaridine has now been assessed in a K18-hACE transgenic mouse model of COVID-19. Pyronaridine treatment demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of viral load in the lungs of SARS CoV-2 infected mice. Furthermore, the pyronaridine treated group reduced lung pathology, which was also associated with significant reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokine and cell infiltration. Notably, pyronaridine inhibited the viral PLpro activity in vitro (IC50 of 1.8 {micro}M) without any effect on Mpro, indicating a possible molecular mechanism involved in its ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Interestingly, pyronaridine also selectively inhibits the host kinase CAMK1 (IC50 of 2.4 {micro}M). We have also generated several pyronaridine analogs to assist in understanding the structure activity relationship for PLpro inhibition. Our results indicate that pyronaridine is a potential therapeutic candidate for COVID-19.\n\nOne sentence summaryThere is currently intense interest in discovering small molecules with direct antiviral activity against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). Pyronaridine, an antiviral drug with in vitro activity against Ebola, Marburg and SARS-CoV-2 has now statistically significantly reduced the viral load in mice along with IL-6, TNF-, and IFN-{beta} ultimately demonstrating a protective effect against lung damage by infection to provide a new potential treatment for testing clinically.",

However, reports of waning vaccine efficacy, coupled with the emergence of variants of concern that are resistant to antibody neutralization, have raised concerns about the potential lack of durability of immunity to vaccination. We recently reported findings from a comprehensive analysis of innate and adaptive immune responses in 56 healthy volunteers who received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccination. Here, we analyzed antibody responses to the homologous Wu strain as well as several variants of concern, including the emerging Mu (B.1.621) variant, and T cell responses in a subset of these volunteers at six months (day 210 post-primary vaccination) after the second dose. Our data demonstrate a substantial waning of antibody responses and T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, at 6 months following the second immunization with the BNT162b2 vaccine. Notably, a significant proportion of vaccinees have neutralizing titers below the detection limit, and suggest a 3rd booster immunization might be warranted to enhance the antibody titers and T cell responses.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically demonstrated the need for improved vaccination strategies and therapeutic responses to combat infectious diseases. However, the efficacy of vaccines has not yet been demonstrated in combination with commonly used immunosuppressive drug regimens. We sought to determine how common pharmaceutical drugs used in autoimmune disorders can alter immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vaccination.\n\nWe treated mice with five immunosuppressant drugs (cyclophosphamide, leflunomide, methotrexate, methylprednisolone, and mycophenolate mofetil), each with various mechanisms of action prior to and following immunization with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We assessed the functionality of antibody responses to spike protein and compared immune cell populations in mice that received no treatment with those that received continuous or temporarily suspended immune suppressive therapy.\n\nAll tested immunosuppressants significantly reduced the antibody titers in serum and functional antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in immunized mice. Temporarily halting selected immunosuppressants (methylprednisolone and methotrexate, but not cyclophosphamide) improved antibody responses significantly. Through proof-of-principle experiments utilizing a mouse model, we demonstrated that immune suppression in autoimmune disorders through pharmaceutical treatments may impair vaccine response to SARS-CoV-2, and temporary suspension of immunosuppressant treatment may be necessary to mount an effective antibody vaccine response. This work provides feasibility for future clinical assessment of the impact of immunosuppressants on vaccine efficacy in humans.\n\nSignificance StatementImmunosuppressant regimens are widely used as therapies for a variety of diseases, including autoimmune, inflammatory, and cancer. However, immunosuppressants can impair critical immune responses to vaccination. The impact of standard immunosuppressant use on the critical, developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies has not been well-described. In this study, we use a mouse model to determine how different immunosuppressant drugs that act through different mechanisms can impair the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and how modulating these drug regimens may restore antibody levels and function.",

    "abstract": "Syrian golden hamsters exhibit features of severe disease after SARS-CoV-2 challenge and are therefore useful models of COVID-19 pathogenesis and prevention with vaccines. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulates type I interferon, myeloid, and inflammatory signatures similar to human disease, and that weight loss can be prevented with vaccines. However, the impact of vaccination on transcriptional programs associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis and protective adaptive immune responses is unknown. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 challenge in hamsters stimulates antiviral, myeloid, and inflammatory programs as well as signatures of complement and thrombosis associated with human COVID-19. Notably, single dose immunization with Ad26.COV2.S, an adenovirus serotype 26 vector (Ad26)-based vaccine expressing a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, prevents the upregulation of these pathways such that the gene expression profiles of vaccinated hamsters are comparable to uninfected animals. Finally, we show that Ad26.COV2.S vaccination induces T and B cell signatures that correlate with binding and neutralizing antibody responses. These data provide further insights into the mechanisms of Ad26.COV2.S based protection against severe COVID-19 in hamsters.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn this study, we show that vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S protected SARS-CoV-2 challenged hamsters from developing severe COVID-19 disease by attenuating excessive proinflammatory responses, such as IL-6 and IL-1, macrophages and neutrophils signaling. Ad26 vaccination also prevented the upregulation of pathways associated with thrombosis such coagulation and clotting cascades associated with infection, and the transcriptomic profiles of vaccinated animals were largely comparable to control uninfected hamsters. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 challenged unvaccinated hamsters showed significant increase of these proinflammatory and prothrombotic pathways and significant weight loss compared to vaccinated hamsters.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans (CA), a commensal and opportunistic eukaryotic organism, frequently inhabits the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and causes life-threatening infections. Antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis is a major risk factor for increased CA colonization and dissemination from the GI tract. We identified a significant increase of taurocholic acid (TCA), a major bile acid in antibiotic-treated mice susceptible to CA infection. In vivo findings indicate that administration of TCA through drinking water is sufficient to induce colonization and dissemination of CA in wild type and immunosuppressed mice. Treatment with TCA significantly reduced mRNA expression of immune genes ang4 and Cxcr3 in the colon. In addition, TCA significantly decreased the relative abundance of three culturable species of commensal bacteria, Turicibacter sanguinis, Lactobacillus johnsonii, and Clostridium celatum, in both cecal contents and mucosal scrapings from colon. Taken together, our results indicate that TCA promotes fungal colonization and dissemination of CA from the GI tract by controlling host defense system and intestinal microbiota that play a critical role in regulating CA in the intestine.\n\nImportanceBroad-spectrum antibiotics, FDA-approved bile acid drugs, and probiotics used to control metabolic and infectious diseases profoundly alter the level of TCA in the gut. Furthermore, TCA level is highly altered in a subset of cancer, colitis and surgery patients who are highly susceptible to CA infection. Inadvertently, these therapies and disease conditions could be either promoting CA colonization and dissemination. Our findings indicate that TCA alone can induce fungal colonization and dissemination from the intestine. Results from this study will have a significant impact in understanding how bile acids interact with the microbiota and host in regulating invasive fungal infections that originate from the intestine and to develop potential new antifungal therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile is an antibiotic-resistant bacterium that causes serious, toxin-mediated enteric disease in humans and animals. Gut dysbiosis and resultant alterations in the intestinal bile acid profile play an important role in the pathogenesis of C. difficile infection (CDI). Restoration of the gut microbiota and re-establishment of bacterial bile acid metabolism using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been established as a promising strategy against this disease, although this method has several limitations. Thus, a more defined and precise microbiota-based approach using bacteria that biotransform primary bile acids into secondary bile acids could effectively overcome these limitations and control CDI. Therefore, a screening pipeline was developed to isolate bile acid converting bacteria from fecal samples. Dogs were selected as a model CDI-resistant microbiota donor for this pipeline, which yielded a novel Peptacetobacter hiranonis strain that possesses unique anti-C. difficile properties, and both bile acid deconjugation and 7- dehydroxylating activities to perform bile acid conversion. The screening pipeline included a set of in vitro tests along with a precision in vivo gut colonization and bile acid conversion test using altered Schadler flora (ASF) colonized mice. In addition, this pipeline also provided essential information on the growth requirements for screening and cultivating the candidate bacterium, its survival in a CDI predisposing environment, and potential pathogenicity. The model pipeline documented here yielded multiple bile acid converting bacteria, including a P. hiranonis isolate with unique anti-C. difficile biotherapeutic potential, which can be further tested in subsequent preclinical and human clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an efficacious therapeutic intervention, but its clinical mode of action and underlying microbiome dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we analysed the metagenomes associated with 142 FMTs, in a time series-based meta-study across five disease indications. We quantified strain-level dynamics of 1,089 microbial species based on their pangenome, complemented with 47,548 newly constructed metagenome-assembled genomes. Using subsets of procedural-, host- and microbiome-based variables, LASSO-regularised regression models accurately predicted the colonisation and resilience of donor and recipient microbes, as well as turnover of individual species. Linking this to putative ecological mechanisms, we found these sets of variables to be informative of the underlying processes that shape the post-FMT gut microbiome. Recipient factors and complementarity of donor and recipient microbiomes, encompassing entire communities to individual strains, were the main determinants of individual strain population dynamics, and mostly independent of clinical outcomes. Recipient community state and the degree of residual strain depletion provided a neutral baseline for donor strain colonisation success, in addition to inhibitive priority effects between species and conspecific strains, as well as putatively adaptive processes. Our results suggest promising tunable parameters to enhance donor flora colonisation or recipient flora displacement in clinical practice, towards the development of more targeted and personalised therapies.",

We show that, depending on cell line and type of edit, ablation of mismatch repair (MMR) affords a 2-17 fold increase in PE efficiency, across several human cell lines, types of edits and genomic loci. The accumulation of the key MMR factors MLH1 and MSH2 at PE sites argues for direct involvement of MMR in PE control.

Alongside other organisms in kinetoplastida, they have evolved an unusual genome architecture that requires all RNA polymerase II transcribed genes to be expressed constitutively, with transcriptional start regions denoted by histone variants and histone lysine acetylation. However, the way these chromatin marks are interpreted by the cell is not understood. Seven predicted bromodomain factors (BDF1-7), the reader modules for acetyl-lysine, were identified across Leishmania genomes. Using L. mexicana as a model, Cas9-driven gene deletions indicate that BDF1-5 are essential for promastigote survival, whilst DiCre inducible gene deletion of the dual bromodomain factor BDF5 identified it to be essential for both promastigotes and amastigotes. ChIP-seq assessment of BDF5s genomic distribution revealed it as highly enriched at transcriptional start sites. Using an optimised proximity proteomic and phosphoproteomic technique, XL-BioID, we defined the BDF5-proximal environment to be enriched for other bromodomain factors, histone acetyltransferase 2, and proteins essential for transcriptional activity and RNA processing. Inducible deletion of BDF5, led to a disruption of pol II transcriptional activity and global defects in gene expression.

    "abstract": "1.Since the introduction of the White-Kauffmann-Le Minor (WKL) scheme for Salmonella serotyping, the nomenclature remains the most widely used for reporting the disease prevalence of Salmonella enterica across the globe. With the advent of whole genome sequencing (WGS), traditional serotyping has been increasingly replaced by in-silico methods that couple the detection of genetic variations in antigenic determinants with sequence-based typing. However, despite the integration of genomic-based typing by in-silico serotyping tools such as SeqSero2 and SISTR, in-silico serotyping in certain contexts remains ambiguous and insufficiently informative due to polyphyletic serovars. Furthermore, in spite of the widespread acknowledgement of polyphyly from genomic studies, the serotyping nomenclature remains unaltered. To prompt refinements to the Salmonella typing nomenclature for disease reporting, we herein performed a systematic characterization of putative polyphyletic serovars and the global Salmonella population structure by comparing 180,098 Salmonella genomes (representing 723 predicted serovars) from GenomeTrakr and PubMLST databases. We identified a range of core genome MLST typing thresholds that result in stable population structure, potentially suitable as the foundation of a genomic-based typing nomenclature for longitudinal surveillance. From the genomic comparisons of hundreds of predicted serovars, we demonstrated that in-silico serotyping classifications do not consistently reflect the population divergence observed at the genomic level. The organization of Salmonella subpopulations based on antigenic determinants can be confounded by homologous recombination and niche adaptation, resulting in shared classification of highly divergent genomes and misleading distinction between highly similar genomes. In consideration of the pivotal role of Salmonella serotyping, a compendium of putative polyphyletic serovars was compiled and made publicly available to provide additional context for future interpretations of in-silico serotyping results in disease surveillance settings. To refine the typing nomenclatures used in Salmonella surveillance reports, we foresee an improved typing scheme to be a hybrid that integrates both genomic and antigenic information such that the resolution from WGS is leveraged to improve the precision of subpopulation classifications while preserving the common names defined by the WKL scheme. Lastly, we stress the importance of controlled vocabulary integration for typing information in open data settings in order for the global Salmonella population dynamics to be fully trackable.\n\n2. Impact StatementSalmonella enterica (S. enterica) is a major foodborne pathogen responsible for an annual incidence rate of more than 90 million cases of foodborne illnesses worldwide. To surveil the high order Salmonella lineages, compare disease prevalence across jurisdictions worldwide, and inform risk assessments, in-silico serotyping has been established as the gold standard for typing the bacteria. However, despite previous Salmonella genomic studies reporting discordance between phylogenomic clades and serovars, refinements have yet been made to the serotyping scheme. Here, we analyzed over 180,000 Salmonella genomes representing 723 predicted serovars to subdivide the population into evolutionarily stable clusters in order to propose a stable organization of the Salmonella population structure that can form the basis of a genomic-based typing scheme for the pathogen. We described numerous instances in which genomes between serotypes are more similar than genomes within a serotype to reflect the inconsistencies of subpopulation classifications based on antigenic determinants. Moreover, we found inconsistencies between predicted serovars and reported serovars which highlighted potential errors in existing in-silico serotyping tools and the need to implement controlled vocabularies for reporting Salmonella subtypes in public databases. The findings of our study aim to motivate the future development of a standardized genomic-based typing nomenclature that more accurately captures the natural populations of S. enterica.\n\n3. Data SummaryThe assembly accession numbers of the genomes analyzed in this study (n = 204,952) and the associated metadata (e.g. sampling location, collection date, FTP address for retrieval) are documented in Table S1. The GenomeTrakr genomes were retrieved from the National Center for Biological Information GenBank database. The PubMLST genomes were retrieved using the BIGSdb API.",

    "abstract": "Flagellar motility is essential for the cell morphology, viability, and virulence of pathogenic kinetoplastids, including trypanosomes. Trypanosoma brucei flagella exhibit a bending wave that propagates from the flagellums tip to its base, rather than base-to-tip as in other eukaryotes. Thousands of dynein motor proteins coordinate their activity to drive ciliary bending wave propagation. Dynein- associated light and intermediate chains regulate the biophysical mechanisms of axonemal dynein. Tctex- type outer arm dynein light chain 2 (LC2) regulates flagellar bending wave propagation direction, amplitude, and frequency in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. However, the role of Tctex-type light chains in regulating T. brucei motility is unknown. Here, we used a combination of bioinformatics, in-situ molecular tagging, and immunofluorescence microscopy to identify a Tctex-type light chain in the procyclic form of T. brucei (TbLC2). We knocked down TbLC2 expression using RNAi, rescued the knockdown with eGFP- tagged TbLC2, and quantified TbLC2s effects on trypanosome cell biology and biophysics. We found that TbLC2 knockdown resulted in kinetoplast mislocalization and the formation of multiple cell clusters in cell culture. We also found that TbLC2 knockdown reduced the directional persistence of trypanosome cell swimming, induced an asymmetric ciliary bending waveform, modulated the bias between the base-to- tip and tip-to-base beating modes, and increased the beating frequency. Together, our findings are consistent with a model of TbLC2 as a down-regulator of axonemal dynein activity that stabilizes the forward tip-to-base beating ciliary waveform characteristic of trypanosome cells. Our work sheds light on axonemal dynein regulation mechanisms that contribute to pathogenic kinetoplastids unique tip-to-base ciliary beating nature and how those mechanisms underlie dynein-driven ciliary motility more generally.\n\nAuthor SummaryKinetoplastea is a class of ciliated protists that include parasitic trypanosomes, which cause severe disease in people and livestock in tropical regions across the globe. All trypanosomes, including Trypanosoma brucei, require a cilium to provide propulsive force for directional swimming motility, host immune evasion, and various aspects of their cell cycle. Thus, a functional cilium is essential for the virulence of the parasite.\n\nTrypanosome cilia exhibit a unique tip-to-base beating mechanism, different from the base-to-tip beating of most other eukaryotic cilia. Multiple ciliary proteins are involved in the complex biophysical and biochemical mechanisms that underly the trypanosome ciliary beating. These include dynein motor proteins that power the beat, dynein-related light chains that regulate the beat, and many other proteins in the nexin-dynein regulatory complex, in the radial spokes, and associated with the central pair of microtubules, for example.\n\nHere, we identify a Tctex-type dynein light chain in T. brucei that we named TbLC2 because it has sequence homology, structural similarity, and ciliary localization like LC2 homologs in other organisms. We demonstrate that TbLC2 has critical dynein regulatory functions, with implications on the unique aspects of trypanosome ciliary beating and cellular swimming motility. Our study represents an additional step toward understanding the functions of the trypanosome ciliary proteome, which could provide novel therapeutic targets against the unique aspects of trypanosome ciliary motility.",

The hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) transcription factor complex mediates hypoxia-specific gene expression by binding to hypoxia responsive element (HRE) sequences within the promoter of target genes. HRE driven expression of therapeutic cargo has been widely explored as a strategy to achieve cancer-specific gene expression. By utilizing this system, we achieve hypoxia-specific expression of two therapeutically relevant cargo elements: the Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) suicide gene and the CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease. Using an expression vector containing five copies of the HRE derived from the vascular endothelial growth factor gene, we are able to show high transgene expression in cells in a hypoxic environment, similar to levels achieved using the CMV and CBh promoters. Furthermore, we are able to deliver our therapeutic cargo to tumor cells with high efficiency using plasmid packaged lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to achieve specific killing of tumor cells in hypoxic conditions, while maintaining tight regulation with no significant changes to cell viability in normoxia.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide functional genetic screens have been successful in discovering genotype-phenotype relationships and in engineering new phenotypes. While broadly applied in mammalian cell lines and in E. coli, use in non-conventional microorganisms has been limited, in part, due to the inability to accurately design high activity CRISPR guides in such species. Here, we develop an experimental-computational approach to sgRNA design that is specific to an organism of choice, in this case the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. A negative selection screen in the absence of non-homologous end-joining, the dominant DNA repair mechanism, was used to generate single guide RNA (sgRNA) activity profiles for both SpCas9 and LbCas12a. This genome-wide data served as input to a deep learning algorithm, DeepGuide, that is able to accurately predict guide activity. DeepGuide uses unsupervised learning to obtain a compressed representation of the genome, followed by supervised learning to map sgRNA sequence, genomic context, and epigenetic features with guide activity. Experimental validation, both genome-wide and with a subset of selected genes, confirms DeepGuides ability to accurately predict high activity sgRNAs. DeepGuide provides an organism specific predictor of CRISPR guide activity that could be broadly applied to fungal species, prokaryotes, and other non-conventional organisms.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic-related strains of Vibrio cholerae are known to cause diarrheal disease in animal hosts. These bacteria must overcome rapid changes in their environment, such as the transition from fresh water to the gastrointestinal system of their host. To study the morphological adjustments during environmental transitions, we used zebrafish as a natural host. Using a combination of fluorescent light microscopy, cryogenic electron tomography and serial block face scanning electron microscopy, we studied the structural changes that occur during the infection cycle. We show that the transition from an artificial nutrient-rich environment to a nutrient-poor environment has a dramatic impact on the cell shape, most notably membrane dehiscence. In contrast, excreted bacteria from the host retain a uniform distance between the membranes as well as their vibrioid shape. Inside the intestine, V. cholerae cells predominantly colonized the anterior to mid-gut, forming micro-colonies associated with the microvilli as well as within the lumen. The cells retained their vibrioid shape but changed their cell-length depending on their localization. Our results demonstrate dynamic changes in morphological characteristics of V. cholerae during the transition between the different environments, and we propose that these structural changes are critical for the pathogens ability to colonize host tissues.",

    "abstract": "The enteric nervous system (ENS) controls many aspects of intestinal homeostasis, including parameters that shape the habitat of microbial residents. Previously we showed that zebrafish lacking an ENS, due to deficiency of the sox10 gene, develop intestinal inflammation and bacterial dysbiosis, with an expansion of proinflammatory Vibrio strains. To understand the primary defects resulting in dysbiosis in sox10 mutants, we investigated how the ENS shapes the intestinal environment in the absence of microbiota and associated inflammatory responses. We found that intestinal transit, intestinal permeability, and luminal pH regulation are all aberrant in sox10 mutants, independent of microbially induced inflammation. Treatment with the proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole, corrected the more acidic luminal pH of sox10 mutants to wild type levels. Omeprazole treatment also prevented overabundance of Vibrio and ameliorated inflammation in sox10 mutant intestines. Treatment with the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide, caused wild type luminal pH to become more acidic, and increased both Vibrio abundance and intestinal inflammation. We conclude that a primary function of the ENS is to regulate luminal pH, which plays a critical role in shaping the resident microbial community and regulating intestinal inflammation.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe intestinal microbiota is an important determinant of health and disease and is shaped by the environment of the gut lumen. The nervous system of the intestine, the enteric nervous system (ENS), helps maintain many aspects of intestinal health including a healthy microbiota. We used zebrafish with a genetic mutation that impedes ENS formation to investigate how the ENS prevents pathogenic shifts in the microbiota. We found that mutants lacking an ENS have a lower luminal pH, higher load of pathogenic bacteria, and intestinal inflammation. We showed that correcting the low pH, using the commonly prescribed pharmacological agent omeprazole, restored the microbiota and prevented intestinal inflammation. Conversely, we found that lowering the luminal pH of wild type animals, using the drug acetazolamide, caused expansion of pathogenic bacteria and increased intestinal inflammation. From these experiments, we conclude that a primary function of the ENS is to maintain normal luminal pH, thereby constraining intestinal microbiota community composition and promoting intestinal health.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas approaches have largely replaced conventional gene targeting strategies. However, homology-directed repair (HDR) in the mouse genome is not very efficient, and precisely inserting longer sequences using HDR remains challenging, given that donor constructs preferentially integrate as concatemers. Here, we show that injecting 5biotinylated donor DNA in mouse embryos at the two-cell stage leads to efficient single-copy HDR (scHDR) alleles. Our dedicated genotyping strategy showed that these alleles occurred with a frequency of 19%, 20%, and 26%, respectively, in three independent gene loci, indicating that scHDR is dramatically boosted by 5biotinylation. Thus, we suggest that a combination of a 5biotinylated donor and diligent analysis of concatemer integration are prerequisites for efficiently and reliably generating conditional alleles or other large fragment knock-ins into the mouse genome.",

    "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that Pkc53E regulates adducin to orchestrate the remodeling of the membrane skeleton following the transmembrane GPCR-Gq signaling. Adducin is a known substrate of PKC and is critical for the assembly of the membrane skeleton by cross-linking actin filaments with the spectrin network. In Drosophila photoreceptors, loss of function in pkc53E leads to retinal degeneration while Pkc53E-RNAi negatively impacts the actin cytoskeleton of the visual organelle rhabdomeres. Unexpectedly, Pkc53E-RNAi enhances the degeneration caused by the loss of PLC{beta}4 (norpAP24). We show that when PLC{beta}4 is absent Plc21C may be activated instead for activating Pkc53E. We investigate whether Pkc53E phosphorylates adducin in vivo and observed that levels of phosphorylated adducin at the conserved PKC site were greatly reduced in a null allele of pkc53E. We show Pkc53E-RNAi did not modify adducin-RNAi, which exerts a more severe effect on the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, overexpression of the mCherry-tagged adducin that appears to act in a dominant-negative manner interferes with the spectrin interaction leading to the apical expansion of rhabdomeres similar to that of {beta}-spectrin-RNAi. We performed epistasis analysis and show that double mutants of the tagged adducin and Pkc53E-RNAi display the expansion phenotype at the eclosion, but progress to severe degeneration in adult photoreceptors. Together, most of our findings support that adducin is likely regulated by Pkc53E in Drosophila photoreceptors.",

Telangiectasias occur in most patients, and pulmonary, visceral, or cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in 20-50% of these. How HHT mutations cause these clinical manifestations and why some patients suffer more serious sequelae than others is unknown. PTPN14 is a genetic modifier of pulmonary AVM incidence, and here we show by gene expression network analysis of a large panel of genetically diverse mouse lung RNA samples, that Ptpn14 is ontologically associated with markers of angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, and BMP/TGF{beta} and Rho kinase signaling. We demonstrate physical interaction between protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor, type 14 (PTPN14) and SMAD4 in nucleus and cytoplasm of primary human endothelial cells. PTPN14 suppresses ubiquitination and turnover of SMAD4 to augment tonic SMAD-mediated transcriptional readouts. This is the first report that PTPN14 binds and stabilizes SMAD4, a key component of the HHT signaling pathway. Through this mechanism, and its inhibition of YAP/TAZ signaling, PTPN14 levels may protect against development of AVMs in HHT. We discuss potential druggable targets for HHT within the ENG-ALK1-SMAD4-PTPN14 network.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryPTPN14 binds and stabilizes SMAD4 to potentiate BMP9 signaling in endothelial cells and components of the PTPN14 network may be drug targets for HHT.",

    "abstract": "Primary open-angle glaucoma progression is associated with increased human trabecular meshwork (HTM) stiffness and elevated transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF{beta}2) levels in aqueous humor. Increased transcriptional activity of Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), central players in mechanotransduction, are implicated in glaucomatous HTM (GTM) cell dysfunction. Yet, the detailed mechanisms underlying YAP/TAZ modulation in HTM cells in response to alterations in extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and TGF{beta}2 levels are not well understood. Using biomimetic ECM hydrogels with tunable stiffness, here we show that increased ECM stiffness elevates YAP/TAZ transcriptional activity potentially through modulating focal adhesions and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Furthermore, TGF{beta}2 increased YAP/TAZ nuclear localization in both normal and glaucomatous HTM cells, which was prevented by inhibiting extracellular-signal-regulated kinase and Rho-associated kinase signaling pathways. Filamentous (F)-actin depolymerization reversed TGF{beta}2-induced YAP/TAZ nuclear localization. YAP/TAZ depletion using siRNA or verteporfin decreased focal adhesions, ECM remodeling and cell contractile properties. Similarly, YAP/TAZ inactivation with verteporfin partially blocked TGF{beta}2-induced HTM/GTM hydrogel contraction and stiffening. Collectively, our data provide evidence for a pathologic role of aberrant YAP/TAZ signaling in glaucomatous HTM cell dysfunction, and may help inform strategies for the development of novel multifactorial approaches to prevent progressive ocular hypertension in glaucoma.",

    "abstract": "RAF kinases are essential effectors of RAS, but how RAS binding initiates the conformational changes needed for autoinhibited RAF monomers to form active dimers has remained unclear. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of full-length BRAF complexes derived from mammalian cells: autoinhibited, monomeric BRAF:14-3-32:MEK and BRAF:14-3-32 complexes, and an inhibitor-bound, dimeric BRAF2:14-3-32 complex, at 3.7, 4.1, and 3.9 [A] resolution, respectively. In both autoinhibited, monomeric structures, the RAS binding domain (RBD) of BRAF is resolved, revealing that the RBD forms an extensive contact interface with the 14-3-3 protomer bound to the BRAF C-terminalsite and that key basic residues required for RBD-RAS binding are exposed. Moreover, through structure-guided mutational studies, our findings indicate that RAS-RAF binding is a dynamic process and that RBD residues at the center of the RBD:14-3-3 interface have a dual function, first contributing to RAF autoinhibition and then to the full spectrum of RAS-RBD interactions.",

The first step in GlcNAc metabolism is phosphorylation to GlcNAc-6-phosphate. In bacteria, the ROK family kinase NagK performs this activity. Although ROK kinases have been studied extensively, no ternary complex showing the two substrates has yet been observed. Here, we solved the structure of NagK from the human pathogen Plesiomonas shigelloides in complex with GlcNAc and the ATP analogue AMP-PNP. Surprisingly, PsNagK showed two conformational changes associated with the binding of each substrate. Consistent with this, the enzyme showed a sequential random enzyme mechanism. This indicates that the enzyme acts as a coordinated unit responding to each interaction. Molecular dynamics modelling of catalytic ion binding confirmed the location of the essential catalytic metal. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the catalytic base, and that the metal coordinating residue is essential.

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9 system is widely used in a broad range of gene-editing applications. While this gene-editing technique is quite accurate in the target region, there may be many unplanned off-target edited sites. Consequently, a plethora of computational methods have been developed to predict off-target cleavage sites given a guide RNA and a reference genome. However, these methods are based on small-scale datasets (only tens to hundreds of off-target sites) produced by experimental techniques to detect off-target sites with a low signal-to-noise ratio. Recently, CHANGE-seq, a new in vitro experimental technique to detect off-target sites, was used to produce a dataset of unprecedented scale and quality (more than 200,000 off-target sites over 110 guide RNAs). In addition, the same study included GUIDE-seq experiments for 58 of the guide RNAs to produce in vivo measurements of off-target sites. Here, we fill the gap in previous computational methods by utilizing these data to perform a systematic evaluation of data processing and formulation of the CRISPR off-target site prediction problem. Our evaluations show that data transformation as a pre-processing phase is critical prior to model training. Moreover, we demonstrate the improvement gained by adding potential inactive off-target sites to the training datasets. Furthermore, our results point to the importance of adding the number of mismatches between the guide RNA and the off-target site as a feature. Finally, we present predictive off-target in vivo models based on transfer learning from in vitro. Our conclusions will be instrumental to any future development of an off-target predictor based on high-throughput datasets.",

Inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) is an ER membrane-resident kinase/RNase that mediates signal transmission in the most evolutionarily conserved branch of the UPR. Dimerization and/or higher-order oligomerization of IRE1 are thought to be important for its activation mechanism, yet the actual oligomeric states of inactive, active, and attenuated mammalian IRE1 complexes remained unknown. We developed an automated two-color single-molecule tracking approach to dissect the oligomerization of tagged endogenous human IRE1 in live cells. In contrast to previous models, our data indicate that IRE1 exists as a constitutive homodimer at baseline and assembles into small oligomers upon ER stress. We demonstrate that the formation of inactive dimers and stress-dependent oligomers is fully governed by IRE1s lumenal domain. Phosphorylation of IRE1s kinase domain occurs more slowly than oligomerization and is retained after oligomers disassemble back into dimers. Our findings suggest that assembly of IRE1 dimers into larger oligomers specifically enables trans- autophosphorylation, which in turn drives IRE1s RNase activity.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo investigate if accounting for a cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) genetic risk score (GRS) modified the association between large CDR and cognitive function among women.\n\nDesignThis was a retrospective study using data from the Womens Health Initiative.\n\nMethodsPatients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension were excluded. Large CDR was defined as [&ge;] 0.6 in either eye. Cognitive function was measured by the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE). We used the combined effects from 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to formulate the GRS for CDR. We used logistic regression to investigate associations between weighted GRS and large CDR, then a linear regression to assess the association between weighted GRS and 3MSE scores, and between weighted GRS, CDR, and 3MSE scores, adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics.\n\nResultsFinal analyses included 1,196 White women with mean age of 69.60 {+/-} 3.62 years and 7.27% with large CDR. Mean GRS in women with and without large CDR was 1.51 {+/-} 0.31 vs. 1.41 {+/-} 0.36, respectively (p = 0.004). The odds of large CDR for a one unit increase in GRS was 2.30 (95% CI: (1.22, 4.36), p = 0.011). Adding the CDR GRS in the model with CDR and 3MSE, women with large CDR still had statistically significantly lower 3MSE scores than those without large CDR, yielding a predicted mean difference in 3MSE scores of 0.84 (p = 0.007).\n\nConclusionsIndependent of the CDR GRS, women with large CDR had a lower cognitive function.",

Ferritin is essential for iron homeostasis and is involved in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. Several structures of ferritin in complex with small molecules and metal ions have been reported. Here we report the crystal structures of Horse Spleen Ferritin, in which the crystals were grown by employing a novel approach adopting the microbatch experiments performed in the presence and absence of electric field using a 2% agarose pellet of CdSO4. We observed that 1) these structures contain increased number of Cd ions as compared to the crystallization of same protein by others using different methods. 2) The externally applied electric field reduced the number of nucleation and with fewer nucleation the size of the crystals increased. 3) There is no significant conformational change observed among these structures. 4) Irrespective of the externally applied electric field, this agarose microbatch crystallization method facilitates the retaining of increased number of bound metal ions with ferritin to mimic the possible in vivo environment.",

    "abstract": "Systematic literature reviews provide rigorous assessments of clinical, cost-effectiveness, and humanistic data. Accordingly, there is a growing trend worldwide among healthcare agencies and decision-makers to require them in order to make informed decisions. Because these reviews are labor-intensive and time consuming, we applied advanced analytic methods (AAM) to determine if machine learning methods could classify abstracts as well as humans. Literature searches were run for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treatments (mNSCLC) and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Records were reviewed by humans and two AAMs. AAM-1 involved a pre-trained data-mining model specialized in biomedical literature, and AAM-2 was based on support vector machine algorithms. The AAMs assigned an accept/reject status, with reasons for exclusion. Automatic results were compared to those of humans. For mNSCLC, 5820 records were processed by humans and 440 (8%) records were accepted and the remaining items rejected. AAM-1 correctly accepted 6% of records and correctly excluded 79%. AAM-2 correctly accepted 6% of records and correctly excluded 82%. The review was completed by AAM-1 or AAM-2 in 52 hours, compared to 196 hours for humans. Work saved was estimated to be 76% and 79% by AAM-1 and AAM-2, respectively. For mCRPC, 2434 records were processed by humans and 26% of these were accepted and 74% rejected. AAM-1 correctly accepted 23% of records and rejected 62%. AAM-2 correctly accepted 20% of records and rejected 66%. The review was completed by AAM-1, AAM-2, and humans in 25, 25 and 85 hours, respectively. Work saved was estimated to be 61% and 68% by AAM-1 and AAM-2, respectively. AAMs can markedly reduce the time required for searching and triaging records during a systematic review. Methods similar to AAMs should be assessed in future research for how consistent their performances are in SLRs of economic, epidemiological and humanistic evidence.",

This cross-sectional study determined the levels of CoPS and the presence of S. aureus in RTE foods sold in Buea municipality.\n\nMethodA total of 420 RTE food samples comprising 70 each of cake, bread, fruit salad, meat-hot-pot, suya and boiled rice were randomly purchased from February to August 2020. The CoPS counts were determined by culturing on Baird-Parker agar and S. aureus identified by amplification of the nuc gene using polymerase chain reaction. All S. aureus isolates were screened for the presence of classical staphylococcal enterotoxin genes and each isolate challenged with 11 antibiotics to determine their antibiotic susceptibility profiles. Oxacillin-resistant S. aureus were analyzed for the presence of mecA gene.\n\nResultOverall, 161 (38.3%) samples had detectable levels of coagulase-positive staphylococci ranging from 2.0-5.81 log10CFU/g. Based on CoPS levels, 37 (8.81%) of the 420 RTE food samples, only fruit salad and meat-hot-pot, had unsatisfactory microbiological quality. A total of 72 S. aureus isolates, comprising 52.78% from fruit salad, 16.67% from meat-hot-pot, 12.5% from boiled rice, 9.72% from suya, 5.56% from bread and 4.17% from cake were recovered. None of the S. aureus isolates possessed any of the classical enterotoxin genes. All the isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and ofloxacin while 68 (94.44%) and 66 (91.67%) were sensitive to oxacillin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. Resistance to penicillin (93.06%) was highest followed by amoxicillin (91.67%) and erythromycin (79.17%). Four isolates were identified as methicillin-resistant S. aureus all of which carried the mecA gene. A total of 24 antibiotypes were identified.\n\nConclusionOur findings showed that RTE foods sold in the Buea municipality are likely vehicles for transmission of CoPS and antibiotic-resistant S. aureus.",

Here, we presented a novel modeling framework based on changes in amino acid sequences and relevant epidemiological data to retrospectively investigate the competitive evolution and transmission of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses in the United States during October 2002 and April 2019. To do so, we estimated the time-varying disease transmission rate from the reported influenza cases and the time-varying antigenic change rate of the viruses from the changes in amino acid sequences. By incorporating the time-varying antigenic change rate into the transmission models, we found that the models could capture the evolutionary transmission dynamics of influenza viruses in the United States. Our modeling results also showed that the antigenic change of the virus plays an essential role in seasonal influenza dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Primary cardiomyocytes are invaluable for understanding postnatal heart development. However, a universal method to obtain freshly purified cardiomyocytes without using different agedependent isolation procedures and cell culture, is lacking. Here, we report the development of a standardised method that allows rapid isolation and purification of high-quality cardiomyocytes from individual neonatal through to adult C57BL/6J murine hearts. Langendorff retrograde perfusion, which is currently limited to adult hearts, was adapted for use in neonatal and infant hearts by developing an easier in situ aortic cannulation technique. Tissue digestion conditions were optimised to achieve efficient digestion of hearts of all ages in a comparable timeframe (<14 min). This resulted in a high yield (1.56-2.2x106 cells/heart) and viability (~70-100%) of cardiomyocytes post-isolation. An immunomagnetic cell separation step was then applied to yield highly purified cardiomyocytes (~95%) as confirmed by immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and qRT-PCR. For cell-type specific studies, cardiomyocyte DNA, RNA, and protein could be extracted in sufficient yields to conduct molecular experiments. We generated transcriptomic datasets for neonatal cardiomyocytes from individual hearts, for the first time, which revealed nine sex-specific genes (FDR<0.05) encoded on the sex chromosomes. Finally, we also developed an in situ fixation protocol that preserved the native cytoarchitecture of cardiomyocytes (~94% rodshaped post-isolation), and used it to evaluate cell morphology during cardiomyocyte maturation, as well as capture spindle-shaped neonatal cells undergoing cytokinesis. Together, these procedures allow molecular and morphological profiling of high-quality cardiomyocytes from individual hearts of any postnatal age.",

Here, we provide a protocol for NuMat preparation in intact Drosophila melanogaster embryos and its use in dissecting the components of nuclear architecture. The protocol does not require isolation of nuclei and therefore maintains the three-dimensional milieu of an intact embryo, which is biologically more relevant compared to cells in culture. One of the advantages of this protocol is that only a small number of embryos are required. The protocol can be extended to larval tissues like salivary glands and imaginal discs with little modification. Taken together, it becomes possible to carry out such studies in parallel to genetic experiments using mutant and transgenic flies. This protocol, therefore, opens the powerful field of fly genetics to cell biology in the study of nuclear architecture.\n\nSummaryNuclear Matrix is a biochemically defined entity and a basic component of the nuclear architecture.

    "abstract": "Homozygous mutations of granulin precursor (GRN) lead to neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis1, a severe neurodevelopmental disease, in humans and neuroinflammation in mice2. Haploinsufficiency of GRN almost invariably causes frontotemporal dementia (FTD)3,4. The GRN locus produces progranulin (PGRN), a lysosomal precursor protein that is cleaved to granulin peptides5,6. Despite intensive investigation, the function of granulins and the reason why their absence causes neurodegeneration remain unclear. Here, we investigated PGRN function in lipid degradation, a major function of lysosomes. We show that PGRN-knockout human cells, PGRN-deficient murine brain, and frontal lobes of human brains from patients with GRN mutation-related FTD have increased levels of gangliosides, highly abundant sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids (GSL) that are degraded in lysosomes. Probing how PGRN deficiency causes these changes, we found normal levels and activities of enzymes that catabolize gangliosides. However, levels of bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a lysosomal lipid required for ganglioside catabolism7, were markedly reduced in PGRN-deficient cells and patient brain tissues. These data indicate that granulins are required to maintain BMP levels, which regulate ganglioside catabolism, and that PGRN deficiency in lysosomes leads to gangliosidosis. This aberrant accumulation of gangliosides may contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Membrane trafficking is essential for sculpting neuronal morphology. The GARP and EARP complexes are conserved tethers that regulate vesicle trafficking in the secretory and endolysosomal pathways, respectively. Both complexes contain the Vps51, Vps52, and Vps53 proteins, and a complex-specific protein: Vps54 in GARP and Vps50 in EARP. In Drosophila, we find that both complexes are required for dendrite morphogenesis during developmental remodeling of multidendritic class IV da (c4da) neurons. Having found that sterol accumulates at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in Vps54KO/KO neurons, we investigated genes that regulate sterols and related lipids at the TGN. Overexpression of oxysterol binding protein (Osbp) or knockdown of the PI4K four wheel drive (fwd) exacerbates the Vps54KO/KO phenotype, whereas eliminating one allele of Osbp rescues it, suggesting that excess sterol accumulation at the TGN is, in part, responsible for inhibiting dendrite regrowth. These findings distinguish the GARP and EARP complexes in neurodevelopment and implicate vesicle trafficking and lipid transfer pathways in dendrite morphogenesis.",

Mother-daughter age asymmetry in yeast is achieved, in part, by inheritance of higher-functioning mitochondria by daughter cells and retention of some high-functioning mitochondria in mother cells. The mitochondrial F-box protein, Mfb1p, tethers mitochondria at both poles in a cell cycle-regulated manner: it localizes to and anchors mitochondria to the mother cell tip throughout the cell cycle, and to the bud tip prior to cytokinesis. Here, we report that cell polarity and polarized localization of Mfb1p decline with age in S. cerevisiae. Moreover, deletion of BUD1/RSR1, a Ras protein required for cytoskeletal polarization during asymmetric yeast cell division, results in depolarized Mfb1p localization, defects in mitochondrial distribution and quality control, and reduced replicative lifespan. Our results demonstrate a role for the polarity machinery in lifespan through modulating Mfb1 function in asymmetric inheritance of mitochondria during yeast cell division.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial isolates that enhance plant growth and suppress plant pathogens growth are essential tools for reducing pesticide applications in plant production systems. The objectives of this study were to develop a reliable fluorescence-based technique for labeling bacterial isolates selected as biological control agents (BCAs) to allow their direct tracking in the host-plant interactions, understand the BCA localization within their host plants, and the route of plant colonization. Objectives were achieved by developing competent BCAs transformed with two plasmids, pBSU101 and pANIC-10A, containing reporter genes eGFP and pporRFP, respectively. Our results revealed that the plasmid-mediated transformation efficiencies of antibiotic-resistant competent BCAs identified as PSL, IMC8, and PS were up 84%. Fluorescent BCA-tagged reporter genes were associated with roots and hypocotyls but not with leaves or stems and were confirmed by fluoresence microscopy and PCR analyses in colonized Arabidopsis and sorghum. This fluorescence-based techniques high resolution and reproducibility make it a platform-independent system that allows tracking of BCAs spatially within plant tissues, enabling assessment of the movement and niches of BCAs within colonized plants. Steps for producing and transforming competent fluorescent BCAs, as well as the inoculation of plants with transformed BCAs, localization, and confirmation of fluorescent BCAs through fluorescence imaging and PCR, are provided in this manuscript. This study features host-plant interactions and subsequently biological and physiological mechanisms implicated in these interactions. The maximum time to complete all the steps of this protocol is approximately three months.\n\nSENTENCE SUMMARYWe describe a novel fluorescence localization technique as a powerful tool to directly visualize and determine the route in-situ of BCAs in host-plants interaction. The study features the host-plant interactions, biological and physiological responses implicated.",

    "abstract": "In the budding yeast S. cerevisiae Cdc42 is required for polarized growth and the formation of mating projections (shmoos). Negatively charged lipids including phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate support a positive feedback loop that recruits Cdc42 effectors and MAP kinase scaffolds, many of which contain polybasic patches that directly interact with the membrane. Here, using genetically encoded sterol sensor ALOD4 we find that ergosterol is accumulated in the cytosolic leaflet of buds and shmoos. The accumulation of ergosterol in the plasma membrane requires both Osh and Lam proteins however cells lacking Ysp2/Lam2 and Lam4 displayed a reversal in the polarity of ergosterol. The redistribution of ergosterol impairs the polarization of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphophate which further impacts shmoo formation, MAPK signaling and mating efficiency. Our observations demonstrate that the ability of Lam proteins to deliver ergosterol from the plasma membrane to the ER helps maintain a gradient of ergosterol which in turn supports robust cell polarity.\n\nSummaryThe sterol sensor ALOD4 is enriched at sites of polarized growth. Elimination of the Osh proteins solubilized the ALOD4 whereas elimination of Ysp2 and Lam4 reversed ALOD4 polarization. Cells lacking Ysp2 and Lam4 have defects in mating and MAP kinase signaling.",
