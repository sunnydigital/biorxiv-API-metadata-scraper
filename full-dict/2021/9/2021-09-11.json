    "abstract": "iCn3D was initially developed as a web-based 3D molecular viewer. It then evolved from visualization into a full-featured interactive structural analysis software. It became a collaborative research instrument through the sharing of permanent, shortened URLs that encapsulate not only annotated visual molecular scenes, but also all underlying data and analysis scripts in a FAIR manner. More recently, with the growth of structural databases, the need to analyze large structural datasets systematically led us to use Python scripts and convert the code to be used in Node.js scripts. We showed a few examples of Python scripts at https://github.com/ncbi/icn3d/tree/master/icn3dpython to export secondary structures or PNG images from iCn3D. Users just need to replace the URL in the Python scripts to export other annotations from iCn3D. Furthermore, any interactive iCn3D feature can be converted into a Node.js script to be run in batch mode, enabling an interactive analysis performed on one or a handful of protein complexes to be scaled up to analysis features of large ensembles of structures. Currently available Node.js analysis scripts examples are available at https://github.com/ncbi/icn3d/tree/master/icn3dnode. This development will enable ensemble analyses on growing structural databases such as AlphaFold or RoseTTAFold on one hand and Electron Microscopy on the other. In this paper, we also review new features such as DelPhi electrostatic potential, 3D view of mutations, alignment of multiple chains, assembly of multiple structures by realignment, dynamic symmetry calculation, 2D cartoons at different levels, interactive contact maps, and use of iCn3D in Jupyter Notebook as described at https://pypi.org/project/icn3dpy.",

    "abstract": "MotivationVariant analysis is a core task in bioinformatics that requires integrating data from many sources. This process can be helped by using 3D structures of proteins, which can provide a spatial context that can provide insight into how variants affect function. Many available tools can help with mapping variants onto structures; but each has specific restrictions, with the result that many researchers fail to benefit from valuable insights that could be gained from structural data.\n\nResultsTo address this, we have created a streamlined system for incorporating 3D structures into variant analysis. Variants can be easily specified via URLs that are easily readable and writable, and use the notation recommended by the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS). For example,  https://aquaria.app/SARS-CoV-2/S/?N501Y specifies the N501Y variant of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. In addition to mapping variants onto structures, our system provides summary information from multiple external resources, including COSMIC, CATH-FunVar, and PredictProtein. Furthermore, our system identifies and summarizes structures containing the variant, as well as the variant-position. Our system supports essentially any mutation for any well-studied protein, and uses all available structural data -- including models inferred via very remote homology -- integrated into a system that is fast and simple to use. By giving researchers easy, streamlined access to a wealth of structural information during variant analysis, our system will help in revealing novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying protein function in health and disease.\n\nAvailabilityOur resource is freely available at the project home page (https://aquaria.app).

However, current strategies for quality control of this important step have rarely been investigated or even discussed. We exemplified how reliable benchmark peak lists could be generated for eleven publicly available datasets acquired across different instrumental platforms. Moreover, we demonstrated how these benchmarks can be utilized to derive performance metrics for DPP and tested whether these metrics can be generalized for entire datasets. Relying on this principle, we cross-validated different strategies for quality assurance of DPP, including manual parameter adjustment, variance of replicate injection-based metrics, unsupervised clustering performance, automated parameter optimization, and deep learning-based classification of chromatographic peaks. Overall, we want to highlight the importance of assessing DPP performance on a regular basis.",

There are several tools available to process metagenomic data from raw reads to the interpretation there is still lack of standard approach that can be used to process the metagenomic data step by step. In this study CuBi-MeAn (Customizable Binning and Metagenomic Analysis) create a customizable and flexible processing pipeline, to process the metagenomic data and generate results for further interpretation.\n\nThis study aims to perform metagenomic binning to enhance taxonomical classification, functional potentials, and interactions among microbial populations in environmental systems. This customized pipeline which is comprised of a series of genomic/metagenomic tools designed to recover better quality results and reliable interpretation of the system dynamics for the given systems. For this reason, a metagenomic data processing pipeline is developed to evaluate metagenomic data from three environmental engineering projects.\n\nThe use of our pipeline was demonstrated and compared on three different datasets that were of different sizes, from different sequencing platforms, and generated from three different environmental sources. By designing and developing a flexible and customized pipeline, this study has showed how to process large metagenomic data sets with limited resources. This result not only would help to uncover new information from environmental samples, but also, could be applicable to any other metagenomic studies across various disciplines.",

    "abstract": "Early diabetes research is hampered by limited availability, variable quality and instability of human pancreatic islets in culture. Little is known about the human {beta} cell secretome, and recent studies question translatability of rodent {beta} cell secretory profiles. Here, we verify representativeness of EndoC-{beta}H1, one of the most widely used human {beta} cell lines, as a translational human {beta} cell model based on omics and characterize the EndoC-{beta}H1 secretome. We profiled EndoC-{beta}H1 cells using RNA-seq, Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) and Tandem Mass Tag proteomics of cell lysate. Omics profiles of EndoC-{beta}H1 cells were compared to human {beta} cells and insulinomas. Secretome composition was assessed by DIA proteomics. Agreement between EndoC-{beta}H1 cells and primary adult human {beta} cells was ~90% for global omics profiles as well as for {beta} cell markers, transcription factors and enzymes. Discrepancies in expression were due to elevated proliferation rate of EndoC-{beta}H1 cells compared to adult {beta} cells. Consistently, similarity was slightly higher with benign non-metastatic insulinomas. EndoC-{beta}H1 secreted 671 proteins in untreated baseline state and 3,278 proteins when stressed with non-targeting control siRNA, including known {beta} cell hormones INS, IAPP, and IGF2. Further, EndoC-{beta}H1 secreted proteins known to generate bioactive peptides such as granins and enzymes required for production of bioactive peptides. Unexpectedly, exosomes appeared to be a major mode of secretion in EndoC-{beta}H1 cells. We believe that secretion of exosomes and bioactive peptides warrant further investigation with specialized proteomics workflows in future studies.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=106 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/459582v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1976bc0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@233c4eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14c3350org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bcf0d5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIWe validate EndoC-{beta}H1 as a translational human {beta} cell model using omics.\nC_LIO_LIWe present the first unbiased proteomics composition of human {beta} cell line secretome.\nC_LIO_LIThe secretome of human {beta} cells is more extensive than previously thought.\nC_LIO_LIUntreated cells secreted 671 proteins and stressed cells secreted 3,278 proteins.\nC_LIO_LISecretion of exosomes and bioactive peptides constitute directions of future research.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCurrently, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common chronic liver diseases in the world. Forecasting the short-term, up to 2025, NASH due to fibrosis is one of the leading causes of liver transplantation. Cohort studies revealed that non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has a higher risk of fibrosis progression among NAFLD patients. Identifying differentially expressed genes helps to determine NASH pathogenic pathways, make more accurate diagnoses, and prescribe appropriate treatment.\n\nMethods and ResultsIn this study, we found 11 NASH datasets by searching in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Subsequently, NASH datasets with low-quality control scores were excluded. Four datasets were analyzed with packages of R/Bioconductor. Then, all integrated genes were Imported into Cytoscape to illustrate the protein-protein interactions network. All hubs and nodes degree has been calculated to determine the hub genes with critical roles in networks.Possible correlations between expression profiles of mutual DEGs were identified employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Primary analyzed data were filtered based on gene expression (logFC > 1, logFC < -1) and adj-P-value (<0.05). Ultimately, among 379 DEGs, we selected the top 10 genes (MYC, JUN, EGR1, FOS, CCL2, IL1B, CXCL8, PTGS2, IL6, SERPINE1) as candidates among up and down regulated genes, and critical pathways such as IL-6, IL-17, TGF {beta}, and TNF were identified.\n\nConclusionThe present study suggests an important DEGs, biological processes, and critical pathways involved in the pathogenesis of NASH disease. Further investigations are needed to clarify the exact mechanisms underlying the development and progression of NASH disease.",

However, the phasing blocks of existing methods are broken by large Structural Variations (SVs), and the efficiency is unsatisfactory for population-scale phasing. This paper presents an ultra-fast algorithm, LongPhase, which can simultaneously phase single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and SVs of a human genome in [~]10-20 minutes, 10x faster than the state-of-the-art WhatsHap and Margin. In particular, LongPhase produces much larger phased blocks at almost chromosome level with only long reads (N50=26Mbp). We demonstrate that LongPhase combined with Nanopore is a cost-effective approach for providing chromosome-scale phasing without the need for additional trios, chromosome-conformation, and single-cell strand-seq data.",

For a given MSA, an MSA feature tensor and row attention maps are extracted and converted into 2D residue-residue distance and dihedral angle predictions. We demonstrated that A-Prot predicts long-range contacts better than the existing methods. Additionally, we modeled the 3D structures of the free modeling and hard template-based modeling targets of CASP14. The assessment shows that the A-Prot models are more accurate than most top server groups of CASP14. These results imply that A-Prot captures evolutionary and structural information of proteins accurately with relatively low computational cost. Thus, A-Prot can provide a clue for the development of other protein property prediction methods.",

    "abstract": "The Ediacaran organisms of the Mistaken Point E surface have provided crucial insight into early animal communities, including how they reproduced, the importance of Ediacaran height and what the most important factors were to their community dynamics. Here, we use this iconic community to investigate how morphological variation between eight taxa affected their ability to withstand different flow conditions. For each of Beothukis, Bradgatia, Charniodiscus procerus, Charniodiscus spinosus, Plumeropriscum, Primocandelabrum and Fractofusus we measured the orientation and length of their stems (if present) and their fronds. We statistically tested each taxons stem and frond orientation distributions to see whether they displayed a uniform or multimodal distribution. Where multimodal distributions were identified, the stem/frond length of each cohort was tested to identify if there were differences in size between different orientation groups. We find that Bradgatia and Thectardis show a bimodal felling direction, and infer that they were felled by the turbulent head of the felling flow. In contrast, the frondose rangeomorphs including Beothukis, Plumeropriscum, Primocandelabrum, and the arboreomorphs were felled in a single direction, indicating that they were upright in the water column, and were likely felled by the laminar tail of the felling flow. These differences in directionality suggests that an elongate habit, and particularly possession of a stem, lent greater resilience to frondose taxa against turbulent flows, suggesting that such taxa would have had improved survivability in conditions with higher background turbulence than taxa like Bradgatia and Thectardis, which lacked a stem and which had a higher centre of mass, which may have fared better in quieter water conditions.",

Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham, hypertensive rats (H), and hypertensive rats supplemented with quercetin (HQ). After three months of initial hypertension, quercetin was administered at 50 mg/kg/day for 30 days. Our results indicate that hypertension and serum lipid peroxidation levels were reduced by quercetin supplementation. We observed increased insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, corroborating the insulin tolerance test, HOMA index, and improvements in lipid profile. Despite normal insulin secretion at 2.8 and 20 mM of glucose, animals treated with quercetin exhibited increased number of islets per section; increased protein expression of muscarinic receptor type 3, VEGF, and catalase in islets; and hepatic mRNA levels of Ide were normalized.

    "abstract": "Chlorophyll (Chl) loss is one of the most visible symptoms of heat-induced leaf senescence, especially for cool-season grass species. Suppression of the Chl a Me-dechelatase gene, SGR (also named as nye1), blocked the degradation of Chl a and resulted in the  stay-green trait during leaf senescence. However, effect of Chl a catabolism on plant tolerance to long-term moderate heat stress (35-40{degrees}C) remains unclear. In this study, we suppressed the expression of Chl a catabolic gene, LpSGR, in both constitutive and inducible manners in perennial ryegrass. Constitutive suppression of LpSGR aggravated heat stress-induced chloroplast structure and photosystem damages, disrupted energy utilization/dissipation during photosynthesis, activated ROS generation with weakened ROS-scavenging enzyme activities. Transcriptome comparison among wildtype (WT) and transgenic RNAi plants under either the optimum or high temperature conditions also emphasized the effect of Chl a catabolism on expression of genes encoding photosynthesis system, ROS-generation and scavenging system, and heat shock transcription factors. Furthermore, making use of a modified ethanol-inducible system, we generated stable transgenic perennial ryegrass to suppress LpSGR in an inducible manner. Without ethanol induction, these transgenic lines exhibited the same growth and heat tolerance traits to WT, while under the induction of ethanol spray, the transgenic lines also showed compromised heat tolerance. Taken together, our data suggest that Chl a catabolism is critical for energy dissipation and electron transfer in photosynthesis, ROS-balancing and chloroplast membrane system stability upon long-term moderate heat stress.",

This study developed a dormancy curve and tested a combination of scarification and hormone treatments, across three timepoints, for their ability to break dormancy in NWR and produce viable seedlings and plants. A dormancy curve was established across 9 months post-harvest, which showed maximum germination (95%) by 17 weeks post-harvest and high germination ([&ge;]81 %) through the rest of the testing period. Next, dormancy breaking treatments were tested. At 1 week post-harvest, few seeds germinated ([&le;] 15 %) across all treatment combinations. However, sulfuric acid increased germination shortly after harvest (5.8 %), compared to water (0.5 %) and NaClO (0 %) but resulted in stunted seedlings, all but one of which died shortly thereafter. At 7 weeks, sulfuric acid treated seeds did not result in significantly higher germination than water and maximum germination was still below 15%. By 11 weeks post-harvest, the water treatments had the highest germination and resulted in the most viable plants, indicating that dormancy had begun to break naturally and exceeded the effect of the other scarification treatments. Hormonal treatments had no significant effect on germination or seed viability and no strong conclusions could be drawn about their effect on seedling or plant health. Due to the inability of early germinated seed to consistently produce viable plants and the increase in germination following sufficient cold storage, it is likely that NWR seed has intermediate or deep physiological dormancy.",

    "abstract": "Accurate characterization of splice junctions as well as transcription start and end sites in reference transcriptomes allows precise quantification of transcripts from RNA-seq data and enable detailed investigations of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Using novel computational methods and a combination of PacBio Iso-seq and Illumina short read sequences from 20 diverse tissues and conditions, we generated a comprehensive and highly resolved barley reference transcript dataset (RTD) from the European 2-row spring barley cultivar Barke (BaRTv2.18). Stringent and thorough filtering was carried out to maintain the quality and accuracy of the splice junctions and transcript start and end sites. BaRTv2.18 shows increased transcript diversity and completeness compared to an earlier version, BaRTv1.0. The accuracy of transcript level quantification, splice junctions and transcript start and end sites has been validated extensively using parallel technologies and analysis, including high resolution RT PCR and 5 RACE. BaRTv2.18 contains 39,434 genes and 148,260 transcripts, representing the most comprehensive and resolved reference transcriptome in barley to date. It provides an important and high-quality resource for advanced transcriptomic analyses, including both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, with exceptional resolution and precision.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is predicted to increase the prevalence of vector borne disease due to expansion of insect populations. Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum (CLso) is a phloem-limited pathogen associated with multiple economically important diseases in Solanaceous crops. Little is known about the strategies and pathogenicity factors CLso uses to colonize vector and host. We determined the CLso effector repertoire by predicting SEC secreted proteins across four different CLso haplotypes, investigated effector localization in planta, and profiled effector expression in vector and host. The localization of CLso effectors in Nicotiana revealed diverse eukaryotic subcellular targets. The majority of tested effectors were unable to suppress plant immune responses, indicating they possess unique activities. Expression profiling in tomato and the psyllid Bactericera cockerelli indicated CLso differentially interacts with its host and vector and can switch effector expression in response to the environment. This study reveals CLso effectors possess complex expression patterns, target diverse host organelles and the majority are unable to suppress host immune responses. A mechanistic understanding of Lso effector function will reveal novel targets and provide insight into phloem biology.",

    "abstract": "Graduate students in the United States are reporting increased anxiety, affecting their mental health and attrition in graduate programs. Yet we are only beginning to understand what contributes to graduate student anxiety. Biology Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) have simultaneous roles as teachers, researchers, students, and employees, and factors associated with these tasks may contribute to anxieties in graduate school, particularly in relation to teaching and research responsibilities. To explore factors related to GTA teaching and research anxieties, and guided by social cognitive career theory, we interviewed 23 Biology GTAs at a research-intensive southeastern university. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts revealed five major factors related to GTA anxieties: negative impact on self, negative impact on others, lack of self-efficacy, role tension, and personal anxieties. Lack of self-efficacy was most prevalent for research anxieties, compared to teaching anxieties, where the impact on others (e.g. students) was most prevalent. In research contexts, GTAs with academic career aspirations expressed less anxiety about role tensions compared to GTAs with non-academic career goals. By investigating GTA anxieties, this work can inform professional development or mental health interventions for GTAs and encourage greater awareness and dialogue about mental health issues in academia.",

    "abstract": "Predictive remapping -- the ability of cells in retinotopic brain areas to transiently exhibit spatio-temporal retinotopic shifts beyond the spatial extent of their classical receptive fields -- has been proposed as a primary mechanism that stabilizes our percept of the visual world around the time of saccadic eye movements. Despite the well documented effects of predictive remapping, no study to date has been able to provide a mechanistic account of the neural computations and architecture that actively mediate this ubiquitous phenomenon. We propose a novel neurobiologically inspired general model of predictive remapping in which the underlying pre-saccadic attentional and oculomotor signals manifest as three temporally overlapping forces that act on retinotopic brain areas. These three forces - a centripetal one toward the center of gaze, a convergent one toward the saccade target and a translational one parallel to the saccade trajectory - act in an inverse force field and govern the spatio-temporal dynamics of predictive remapping of population receptive fields. The predictions of our model are borne out by the spatio-temporal changes in sensitivity to probe stimuli in human subjects around the time of an eye movement and are consistent with findings of predictive shifts in the receptive fields of cells in the superior colliculus, frontal eye fields, lateral intraparietal area, and visual area V4.",

    "abstract": "Species are the main unit used to measure biodiversity, but different preferred diagnostic criteria can lead to very different delineations. For instance, named primate species have more than doubled in number since 1982. Such increases have been attributed to a shift away from the  biological species concept (BSC) in favour of less inclusive species criteria. Critics of recent changes in primate taxonomy have suggested taxonomic splitting may be biased toward certain clades and have unfavourable consequences for conservation. Here, we explore predictors of taxonomic splitting across primate taxa since the initial shift away from the BSC nearly 40 years ago. We do not find evidence that diversification rate, the rate of lineage formation over evolutionary time, is significantly linked to splitting, contrary to expectations if new species concepts and taxonomic methods identify incipient species. We also do not find evidence that research effort in fields where work has been suggested to motivate splitting is associated with increases in species numbers among genera. To test the suggestion that splitting groups is likely to increase their perceived risk of extinction, we test whether genera that have undergone more splitting have also observed a greater increase in their proportion of threatened species since the initial shift away from traditional taxonomic methods. We find no cohesive signal of taxonomic splitting leading to higher threat probabilities across primate genera. Overall, this analysis sends a positive message: threat statuses of primate species are not being overwhelmingly affected by splitting. Regardless, we echo warnings that it is unwise for conservation to be reliant on taxonomic stability. Species (however defined) are not independent from one another, thus, monitoring and managing them as such may not meet the overarching goal of conserving biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Glutamate is the amino acid with the highest cerebral concentration. It plays a central role in brain metabolism. It is also the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and is involved in multiple cognitive functions. Alterations of the glutamatergic system may contribute to the pathophysiology of many neurological disorders. For example, changes of glutamate availability are reported in rodents and humans during Alzheimers and Huntingtons diseases, epilepsy as well as during aging.\n\nMost studies evaluating cerebral glutamate have used invasive or spectroscopy approaches focusing on specific brain areas. Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer imaging of glutamate (gluCEST) is a recently developed imaging technique that can map glutamate distribution in the entire brain with higher sensitivity and at higher resolution than previous techniques. It thus has strong potential clinical applications to assess glutamate changes in the brain. High field is a key condition to perform gluCEST images with a meaningful signal to noise ratio. Thus, even if some studies started to evaluate gluCEST in humans, most studies focused on rodent models that can be imaged at high magnetic field.\n\nIn particular, systematic characterization of gluCEST contrast distribution throughout the whole brain has never been performed in humans or non-human primates. Here, we characterized for the first time the distribution of the glutamate index in the whole brain and in large-scale networks of mouse lemur primates at 11.7 Tesla. Because of its small size, this primate can be imaged in high magnetic field systems. It is widely studied as a model of cerebral aging or Alzheimers disease. We observed high gluCEST contrast in cerebral regions such as the nucleus accumbens, septum, basal forebrain, cortical areas 24 and 25. Age-related alterations of this biomarker were detected in the nucleus accumbens, septum, basal forebrain, globus pallidus, hypophysis, cortical areas 24, 21, 6 and in olfactory bulbs. An age-related gluCEST contrast decrease was also detected in specific neuronal networks, such as fronto-temporal and evaluative limbic networks. These results outline regional differences of gluCEST contrast and strengthen its potential to provide new biomarkers of cerebral function in primates.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=85 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/459778v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d672a5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@100e883org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a0f827org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3cad0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) controls food intake and energy expenditure. We have earlier described that the high-fat diet (HFD) feeding induces an obesity phenotype with high leptin production and alteration of proteins related to endosome sorting, and ubiquitination in the ARC of mice. In this study, real-time PCR data analysis revealed that HFD feeding decreases significantly Rab3a, Rab3gap1, and Rab3gap2 transcript levels in the ARC when compared to the group receiving a control diet. The decrease of Rab3gap1/2 transcript levels in the ARC was strongly associated with an increase in plasma leptin. Altogether, our studies demonstrate that HFD feeding could be altering the general network of endosome compartmentalization in the ARC of mice, contributing to a failure in exocytosis and receptor recycling.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Biophysical models that attempt to infer real-world quantities from data usually have many free parameters. This over-parameterisation can result in degeneracies in model inversion and render parameter estimation ill-posed. However, in many applications, we are not interested in quantifying the parameters per se, but rather in identifying changes in parameters between experimental conditions (e.g. patients vs controls). Here we present a Bayesian framework to make inference on changes in the parameters of biophysical models even when model inversion is degenerate, which we refer to as Bayesian EstimatioN of CHange (BENCH).\n\nWe infer the parameter changes in two steps; First, we train models that can estimate the pattern of change in the measurements given any hypothetical direction of change in the parameters using simulations. Next, for any pair of real data sets, we use these pre-trained models to estimate the probability that an observed difference in the data can be explained by each model of change.\n\nBENCH is applicable to any type of data and models and particularly useful for biophysical models with parameter degeneracies, where we can assume the change is sparse. In this paper, we apply the approach in the context of microstructural modelling of diffusion MRI data, where the models are usually over-parameterised and not invertible without injecting strong assumptions.\n\nUsing simulations, we show that in the context of the standard model of white matter our approach is able to identify changes in microstructural parameters from conventional multi-shell diffusion MRI data. We also apply our approach to a subset of subjects from the UK-Biobank Imaging to identify the dominant standard model parameter change in areas of white matter hyperintensities under the assumption that the standard model holds in white matter hyperintensities.",

Although hypothesized to signal via volume transmission through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), remarkably little is known about their extrasynaptic diffusion. Here, we developed an all-optical approach to probe neuropeptide volume transmission in mouse neocortex. To control neuropeptide release, we engineered photosensitive nanovesicles with somatostatin-14 (SST) that is released with near-infrared light stimulation. To detect SST, we created a new cell-based neurotransmitter fluorescent engineered reporter (CNiFER) using the SST2 GPCR. Under two-photon imaging, we determined the time to activate SST2R at defined distances as well as the maximal distance and loss rate for SST volume transmission in neocortex. Importantly, we determined that SST transmission is significantly faster in neocortex with a chemically degraded extracellular matrix, a diseased condition indicated in neuroinflammation and Parkinsons disease. These new neurotechnologies can reveal important biological signaling processes previously not possible, and provide new opportunities to investigate volume transmission in the brain.",

    "abstract": "This study demonstrates the functional importance of the Surround context relayed laterally in V1 by the horizontal connectivity, in controlling the latency and the gain of the cortical response to the feedforward visual drive. We report here four main findings : 1) a centripetal apparent motion sequence results in a shortening of the spiking latency of V1 cells, when the orientation of the local inducer and the global motion axis are both co-aligned with the RF orientation preference; 2) this contextual effects grows with visual flow speed, peaking at 150-250{degrees}/s when it matches the propagation speed of horizontal connectivity (0.15-0.25 mm/ms); 3) For this speed range, the axial sensitivity of V1 cells is tilted by 90{degrees} to become co-aligned with the orientation preference axis; 4) the strength of modulation by the surround context correlates with the spatiotemporal coherence of the apparent motion flow. Our results suggest an internally-generated binding process, linking local (orientation /position) and global (motion/direction) features as early as V1. This long-range diffusion process constitutes a plausible substrate in V1 of the human psychophysical bias in speed estimation for collinear motion. Since it is demonstrated in the anesthetized cat, this novel form of contextual control of the cortical gain and phase is a built-in property in V1, whose expression does not require behavioral attention and top-down control from higher cortical areas. We propose that horizontal connectivity participates in the propagation of an internal \"prediction\" wave, shaped by visual experience, which links contour co-alignment and global axial motion at an apparent speed in the range of saccade-like eye-movements.",

    "abstract": "Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a group of neurodegenerative disorders that lead to photoreceptor cell death and eventually blindness. IRDs are characterised by a high genetic heterogeneity, making it imperative to design mutation-independent therapies. Mutations in a number of IRD disease genes have been associated with a rise of cyclic 3,5-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels in photoreceptors. Accordingly, the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) has emerged as a new potential target for the mutation-independent treatment of IRDs. However, the substrates of PKG and the downstream degenerative pathways triggered by its activity have yet to be determined. Here, we performed kinome activity profiling of different murine organotypic retinal explant cultures (diseased rd1 and wild-type controls) using multiplex peptide microarrays to identify proteins whose phosphorylation was significantly altered by PKG activity. In addition, we tested the downstream effect of a known PKG inhibitor CN03 in these organotypic retina cultures. Among the PKG substrates were potassium channels belonging to the Kv1 family (KCNA3, KCNA6), Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 1 (CREB1), DNA topoisomerase 2- (TOP2A), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (F263), and the glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate 2 (GRIK2). The retinal expression of these PKG targets was further confirmed by immunofluorescence and could be assigned to various neuronal cell types, including photoreceptors, horizontal cells, and ganglion cells. Taken together, this study confirmed the key role of PKG in photoreceptor cell death and identified new downstream targets of cGMP/PKG signalling that will improve the understanding of the degenerative mechanisms underlying IRDs.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual decisions arise through the transformation of samples of evidence into a commitment to a proposition or plan of action. Such transformation is thought to involve cortical circuits capable of computation over time scales associated with working memory, attention, and planning. Neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) are thought to play a role in all of these functions, and much of what is known about the neurobiology of decision making has been influenced by studies of LIP and its network of cortical and subcortical connections. However a causal role of neurons in LIP remains controversial. We used pharmacological and chemogenetic methods to inactivate LIP in one hemisphere of four rhesus monkeys. Inactivation produced clear biases in decisions, but the effects dissipated despite the persistence of neural inactivation, implying compensation by other unaffected areas. Compensation occurs on a rapid times scale, within an experimental session, and more gradually, across sessions. The findings resolve disparate studies and inform interpretation of focal perturbations of brain function.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo introduce a Deep-Learning-Based Accelerated and Noise-Suppressed Estimation (DANSE) method for reconstructing quantitative maps of biological tissue cellular-specific, R2t* and hemodynamic-specific, R2' from Gradient-Recalled-Echo (GRE) MRI data with multiple gradient-recalled echoes.\n\nMethodsDANSE method adapts supervised learning paradigm to train a convolutional neural network for robust estimation of R2t* and R2' maps free from the adverse effects of macroscopic (B0) magnetic field inhomogeneities directly from the GRE magnitude images without utilizing phase images. The corresponding ground-truth maps were generated by means of a voxel-by-voxel fitting of a previously-developed biophysical quantitative GRE (qGRE) model accounting for tissue, hemodynamic and B0-inhomogeneities contributions to GRE signal with multiple gradient echoes using nonlinear least square (NLLS) algorithm.\n\nResultsWe show that the DANSE model efficiently estimates the aforementioned brain maps and preserves all features of NLLS approach with significant improvements including noise-suppression and computation speed (from many hours to seconds). The noise-suppression feature of DANSE is especially prominent for data with SNR characteristic for typical GRE data (SNR~50), where DANSE-generated R2t* and R2' maps had three times smaller errors than that of NLLS method.\n\nConclusionsDANSE method enables fast reconstruction of magnetic-field-inhomogeneity-free and noise-suppressed quantitative qGRE brain maps. DANSE method does not require any information about field inhomogeneities during application. It exploits spatial patterns in the qGRE MRI data and previously-gained knowledge from the biophysical model, thus producing clean brain maps even in the environments with high noise levels. These features along with fast computational speed can lead to broad qGRE clinical and research applications.",

    "abstract": "Two types of corticothalamic (CT) terminals reach the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, and their distribution varies according to the hierarchical level of the cortical area they originate from. While type 2 terminals are more abundant at lower hierarchical levels, terminals from higher cortical areas mostly exhibit type 1 axons. Such terminals also evoke different excitatory postsynaptic potential dynamic profiles, presenting facilitation for type 1 and depression for type 2. As the pulvinar is involved in the oscillatory regulation between intercortical areas, fundamental questions about the role of these different terminal types in the neuronal communication throughout the cortical hierarchy are yielded. Our theoretical results support that the co-action of the two types of terminals produces different oscillatory rhythms in pulvinar neurons. More precisely, terminal types 1 and 2 produce alpha-band oscillations at a specific range of connectivity weights. Such oscillatory activity is generated by an unstable transition of the balanced state networks properties that it is found between the quiescent state and the stable asynchronous spike response state. While CT projections from areas 17 and 21a are arranged in the model as the empirical proportion of terminals types 1 and 2, the actions of these two cortical connections are antagonistic. As area 17 generates low-band oscillatory activity, cortical area 21a shifts pulvinar responses to stable asynchronous spiking activity and vice-versa when area 17 produces an asynchronous state. To further investigate such oscillatory effects through corticothalamo-cortical projections, the transthalamic pathway, we created a cortical feedforward network of two cortical areas, 17 and 21a, with CT connections to a pulvinar-like network. With this model, the transthalamic pathway propagates alpha waves from the pulvinar to area 21a. This oscillatory transfer ceases when reciprocal connections from area 21a reach the pulvinar, closing the cortico-thalamic loop. Taken together, results of our model suggest that the pulvnar shows a bi-stable spiking activity, oscillatory or regular asynchronous spiking, whose responses are gated by the different activation of cortico-pulvinar projections from lower to higher-order areas such as areas 17 and 21a.",

To test hypotheses about neuropharmacological influences on self-control, we used positron emission tomography to measure dopamine D2-like receptors (D2R) and experience sampling surveys to naturalistically track daily desires outside the laboratory in everyday life in a sample of 103 adults. Higher D2R availability in the ventral striatum was associated with increased sensitivity to personal goal conflict but not desire strength in deciding whether to attempt to resist a desire. The influence of D2Rs on sensitivity to personal goal conflict depended on whether desires were experienced in a social context. D2R availability in the midbrain (but not the ventral striatum) influenced whether desires were enacted.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) encodes negative reward prediction error (RPE) and plays an important role in guiding behavioral responding to aversive stimuli. While initial studies describing the RMTg revealed the presence of cortical afferents, the density and distribution of this input has not been explored in detail. In addition, the functional consequences of cortical modulation of RMTg signaling are only just beginning to be investigated. The current study anatomically and functionally characterizes cortical input to the RMTg in rats. Findings from this work reveal dense input spanning the entire medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) as well as the orbitofrontal cortex and anterior insular cortex. Afferents were most dense in the dorsomedial subregion of the PFC (dmPFC), an area which has also been implicated in both RPE signaling and aversive responding. RMTg-projecting dmPFC neurons originate in layer V and collateralize extensively throughout the brain. In-situ mRNA hybridization further revealed that neurons in this circuit are predominantly D1 receptor-expressing with a high degree of D2 receptor colocalization. Optogenetic stimulation of dmPFC terminals in the RMTg drives avoidance, and cFos expression is enhanced in this neural circuit during exposure to aversive stimuli. Exposure to such aversive stimuli results in significant physiological and structural plasticity suggestive of a loss of top-down modulation of RMTg-mediated signaling. Altogether, these data reveal the presence of a prominent cortico-subcortical projection involved in adaptive behavioral responding and provide a foundation for future work aimed at exploring alterations in circuit function in diseases characterized by deficits in cognitive control over the balance between reward and aversion.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe amygdala (AMY) is a key brain region of the limbic system that plays a critical role in emotion processing and stress response. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies identified abnormal AMY activation in psychiatric illnesses including major depressive disorder (MDD). Stress exposure is a major precipitating factor of MDD episodes which are associated with AMY hyperactivity. Preclinical studies using of pharmacologic, opto- and chemogenetic approaches to activate AMY neurons have consistently demonstrated that acute AMY hyperactivation induces anxiety-like behaviors in mice. However, it remains unknown if chronic hyperactivation of the amygdala (cHOA) is sufficient to induce chronic stress-like deficits or is a susceptibility factor for chronic stress-induced behavioral, volumetric and synaptic deficits.\n\nMethodsUsing designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug (DREADD) approach, basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons of Camk2a-cre mice infected with a virus driving the expression of the Gq-coupled DREADD were activated with clozapine-N-oxide (in drink water for 5 weeks). Mice were then exposed to chronic restraint stress (CRS; 1X/day for 1hr) for 2 weeks. All mice were behaviorally assessed in the Phenotyper (PT), and sucrose consumption tests (SCT) each week and in the novelty supressed feeding (NSF, once at the end of the experiment). Animals were then perfused for ex vivo-MRI and puncta density analysis.\n\nResultsWe found that mice with cHOA displayed a progressive increase in baseline anxiety-like deficits in the PT test and slightly more marked deficits following CRS compared to controls, but not statistically different from animals subjected to CRS alone. Also, cHOA did not exacerbate CRS effect in the NSF. No significant cAH effect was found in the SCT before or after CRS. MRI analysis revealed no statistical charges between groups, while increased synaptic puncta density was found in cHOA mice subjected to CRS compared to cHOA or CRS alone.\n\nConclusionWe demonstrate that cAH is sufficient to induce anxiety and may exacerbate CRS effects on anxiety and synaptic measures. Results also suggest that cHOA was not sufficient to induce depressive-like behavior and was not a vulnerability factor for stress-induced depressive-like behavior in mice. Altogether, our findings imply that a strong causal link between AMY hyperactivity and elevated anxiety, but not depressive-like behaviors and provide critical information to clinical research focused on using AMY activity level as a biomarker in stress-related illnesses.",

Even though the localization of single focal sources should be relatively straightforward, different methods provide diverse solutions due to the different underlying assumptions. Furthermore, their input parameter(s) further affects the solution provided by each method, making localization even more challenging. In addition, validations and comparisons are typically performed either on synthetic data or through post-operative outcomes, in both cases with considerable limitations.\n\nWe use an in-vivo high-density EEG dataset recorded during intracranial single pulse electrical stimulation, in which the true sources are substantially dipolar and their locations are known. We compare ten different ESI methods under multiple choices of input parameters, to assess the accuracy of the best reconstruction, as well as the impact of the parameters on the localization performance.\n\nBest reconstructions often fall within 1 cm from the true source, with more accurate methods outperforming less accurate ones by 1 cm, on average. Expectedly, dipolar methods tend to outperform distributed methods. Sensitivity to input parameters varies widely between methods. Depth weighting played no role for three out of six methods implementing it. In terms of regularization parameters, for several distributed methods SNR=1 unexpectedly turned out to be the best choice among the tested ones.\n\nOur data show similar levels of accuracy of ESI techniques when applied to \"conventional\" (32 channels) and dense (64, 128, 256 channels) EEG recordings.\n\nOverall findings reinforce the importance that ESI may have in the clinical context, especially when applied to identify the surgical target in potential candidates for epilepsy surgery.",

Behavioral and computational studies have shown that visual information is associated with working memory performance. However, the underlying neural correlates remain unknown. To identify how visual information affects working memory performance, we conducted behavioral experiments and single unit recordings in the avian prefrontal analog, the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL). Complex pictures featuring luminance, spatial and color information, were associated with higher working memory performance compared to uniform gray pictures in conjunction with distinct neural coding patterns. For complex pictures, we found a multiplexed neuronal code displaying visual and value-related features that switched to a representation of the upcoming choice during a delay period. When processing gray stimuli, NCL neurons did not multiplex and exclusively represented the choice already during stimulus presentation and throughout the delay period. The prolonged representation possibly resulted in a decay of the memory trace ultimately leading to a decrease in performance. In conclusion, we found that high stimulus complexity is associated with neuronal multiplexing of the working memory representation possibly allowing a facilitated read-out of the neural code resulting in enhancement of working memory performance.",

Disrupted habituation is a signature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In rodents, habituation is observed in neural, neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to repeated exposure to the predictable and moderately intense stress or restraint. We previously demonstrated that lesions to the posterior division of the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (pPVT) impairs habituation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and specific neural connections among the pPVT and other brain regions that underlie habituation are unknown.\n\nMETHODSBehavioral and neuroendocrine habituation was assessed in adult male Sprague-Dawley restraints using the repeated restraint paradigm. Pan neuronal and Cre-dependent Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) were used to chemogenetically inhibit the pPVT and the subpopulation of pPVT neurons that project to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), respectively. Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) expression was knocked down in the pPVT using siRNA directed towards Arc. Golgi staining was used to assess structural plasticity of pPVT neurons. Local field potential recordings were used to assess coherent neural activity between the pPVT and mPFC. The attentional set-shifting task was used to assess mPFC-dependent behavior.\n\nRESULTSHere, we show that Arc promotes habituation by increasing stress-induced spinogenesis in the pPVT, increasing coherent neural activity with the mPFC, and improving mPFC-mediated cognitive flexibility.\n\nCONCLUSIONOur results demonstrate that Arc induction in the pPVT regulates habituation to repeated restraint and mPFC function.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe demonstrate that Arc in the posterior division of the paraventricular thalamic nucleus promotes habituation to repeated stress by increasing dendritic spines.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in neural decoding have accelerated the development of brain-computer interfaces aimed at assisting users with everyday tasks such as speaking, walking, and manipulating objects. However, current approaches for training neural decoders commonly require large quantities of labeled data, which can be laborious or infeasible to obtain in real-world settings. One intriguing alternative uses self-supervised models that share self-generated pseudo-labels between two data streams; such models have shown exceptional performance on unlabeled audio and video data, but it remains unclear how well they extend to neural decoding. Here, we learn neural decoders without labels by leveraging multiple simultaneously recorded data streams, including neural, kinematic, and physiological signals. Specifically, we apply cross-modal, self-supervised deep clustering to decode movements from brain recordings; these decoders are compared to supervised and unimodal, self-supervised models. We find that sharing pseudo-labels between two data streams during training substantially increases decoding performance compared to unimodal, self-supervised models, with accuracies approaching those of supervised decoders trained on labeled data. Next, we develop decoders trained on three modalities that match or slightly exceed the performance of supervised models, achieving state-of-the-art neural decoding accuracy. Cross-modal decoding is a flexible, promising approach for robust, adaptive neural decoding in real-world applications without any labels.",

In early sensory systems, neural populations have diverse receptive fields structured to detect important features in inputs, yet significant variability has been ignored in classical models of sensory neurons. We model neuronal receptive fields as random, variable samples from parameterized distributions and demonstrate this model in two sensory modalities using data from insect mechanosensors and mammalian primary visual cortex. Our approach leads to a significant theoretical connection between the foundational concepts of receptive fields and random features, a leading theory for understanding artificial neural networks. The modeled neurons perform a randomized wavelet transform on inputs, which removes high frequency noise and boosts the signal. Further, these random feature neurons enable learning from fewer training samples and with smaller networks in artificial tasks. This structured random model of receptive fields provides a unifying, mathematically tractable framework to understand sensory encodings across both spatial and temporal domains.",

The composition of the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) has decisive impacts on therapy response and disease outcome. High dimensional analyses of patient samples can reveal the composition and heterogeneity of the immune TME. In particular, macrophages are known for their cancer-supportive role, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood, and experimental in vivo systems are needed to test the functional properties of these cells. We characterized a humanized mouse model, reconstituted with a human immune system and a human melanoma, in which: (1) human macrophages support metastatic spread of the tumor; and (2) tumor-infiltrating macrophages have a specific transcriptional signature that faithfully represents the transcriptome of macrophages from patient melanoma samples and is associated with shorter survival. This model complements patient sample analyses, enabling the elucidation of fundamental principles in melanoma biology, and the development and evaluation of candidate therapies.",

    "abstract": "Exploring and clearly defining the level of taxonomic identification and quantification approaches for diversity and biomonitoring studies are essential, given its potential influence on the assessment and interpretation of ecological outcomes. In this study, we evaluated the response of benthic macroinvertebrate communities to the restoration or construction of gravel bars conducted in the dam-impacted Trinity River, with the non-dam influenced tributaries serving as the reference sites. We aim to evaluate the performance of different taxonomic and numerical (i.e., abundance vs. presence/absence data) resolutions of DNA metabarcoding with consequent comparison to morphology-based identification and how it affects assessment outcomes. DNA metabarcoding detected 93% of the morphologically identified individuals and provided finer taxonomic resolution. We also detected significant correlations between morphological sample abundance, biomass, and DNA metabarcoding read abundance. We observed a relatively high and significant congruence in macroinvertebrate community structure and composition between different taxonomic and numerical resolutions of both methods, indicating a satisfactory surrogacy between the two approaches and their varying identification levels and data transformation. Additionally, the community-environmental association were significant for all datasets but showed varying significant associations against the physicochemical parameters. Furthermore, both methods identified Simulium spp. as significant indicators of the dam-impacted gravel bars. Still, only DNA metabarcoding showed significant false discovery rate proving the methods robustness compared to morphology-based identification. Our observations imply that coarser taxonomic resolution could be highly advantageous to DNA metabarcoding-based applications in situations where the lack of taxonomic information, e.g., poor reference database, might severely affect the quality of biological assessments.",

    "abstract": "The milky sea is one of the unique natural phenomena caused by the presence of luminous Vibrio bacteria in marine ecosystems. Recently a milky sea has been reported frequently included in the Java Southern Sea. Simultaneously, numerous remote sensing based approaches have been developed to detect the presence of luminous bacteria and the milky sea. Despite this state of the art, the information of detrimental factors of the marine bioluminescence was still limited. Then this research aims to model the underlying environmental factors causing the milky sea and luminous bacteria presence in the Java Southern Sea in 2019. The remote sensing assessment for the period of July 29-August 6, 2019 shows that the magnitude of bioluminescence measured in radiance was having a maximum value of 255 nanoW/cm2/sr and an average of 107 nanoW/cm2/sr/day (95%CI: 71.9 to 142 nanoW/cm2/sr/day). The milky sea size increased and reached its peak with a size of 44,124 km2 and then declined. The average milky sea size was 37,942 km2 (95% CI: 33,400 to 42,500 km2) and increased with average rate of 16.01% (95%CI: 5.41% to 26.66%). While Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) indicates that the best model to infer the relationship of bacterial bioluminescence with its environmental factors contained Chlorophyll a followed by sea surface temperature factors with AICc values of 101.16 (AICweight: 0.50) and 101.95 (AICweight: 0.34). This indicates that low temperature and high plankton cells is the limiting factors of the bacterial bioluminescence.",

Edge effects have rarely been linked to altered soil biota, which shape ecosystem processes including carbon storage, biogeochemical cycling, and plant performance. Here, we investigated if agriculturally-mediated increased wildlife populations affect soil biotic communities at a distance well over that of estimated edge effects when they move between agriculture and natural habitats using a 22-year fenced exclusion experiment in a primary rainforest in Peninsular Malaysia. We found that the presence of wildlife (mainly native pigs (Sus scrofa) that crop-raid in nearby oil palm plantations) was associated with higher bacterial diversity, and an altered community composition (mediated by changes in soil pH), and reduced abundances of symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi compared to soil in exclosures. There were only minor effects of pigs on soil chemistry or microclimate, so we suggest that changes in soil communities are driven by pigs leaf litter removal and alterations to plant composition. Our study highlights that indirect effects from agriculture can be transferred by wildlife >1 km into protected areas and this could have important repercussions for ecosystem processes and plant-soil feedbacks.",

Barr) in the early 20th century resulted in the demise of American chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.; Fagaceae) as a major component of forest canopies and had negative impacts on eastern forest communities. Research efforts over the last century have documented the persistence of occasional trees and root crown/stump sprouts throughout much of the species historic range providing the basis for ongoing breeding of blight-resistant stock and restoration efforts. Unfortunately, it remains unclear how much of the historic range remains climatically suitable for remnant trees that may harbor unique genetic variation for successful reintroduction efforts. Here we investigate whether the southwestern portion of the historical range remains environmentally suitable for undiscovered remnant populations of C. dentata using environmental niche modeling. We also use stage-structured matrix projection models to investigate the potential demographic future of C. dentata in W Tennessee, N Mississippi, SW Kentucky, and NW Alabama based upon observations of American chestnut in these areas over the last several decades. We found that suitable habitat associated with higher elevations and areas of high forest canopy cover occurs throughout much of the southwestern portion of the historical range and that populations of American chestnut in these areas are predicted to drastically decline over the next ~100-200 years without conservation interventions to mitigate the negative consequences of chestnut blight.",

    "abstract": "It is well known in the literature that human behavior can change as a reaction to disease observed in others, and that such behavioral changes can be an important factor in the spread of an epidemic. It has been noted that human behavioral traits in disease avoidance are under selection in the presence of infectious diseases. Here we explore a complimentary trend: the pathogen itself might experience a force of selection to become less \"visible\", or less \"symptomatic\", in the presence of such human behavioral trends. Using a stochastic SIR agent-based model, we investigated the co-evolution of two viral strains with cross-immunity, where the resident strain is symptomatic while the mutant strain is asymptomatic. We assumed that individuals exercised self-regulated social distancing (SD) behavior if one of their neighbors was infected with a symptomatic strain. We observed that the proportion of asymptomatic carriers increased over time with a stronger effect corresponding to higher levels of self-regulated SD. Adding mandated SD made the effect more significant, while the existence of a time-delay between the onset of infection and the change of behavior reduced the advantage of the asymptomatic strain. These results were consistent under random geometric networks, scale-free networks, and a synthetic network that represented the social behavior of the residents of New Orleans.",

    "abstract": "Different reproductive modes are characterized by costs and benefits which often depend on ecological contexts. Benefits of sex are expected to increase under complex biotic interactions, whereas parthenogenesis can be beneficial for reproductive assurance when females are mate limited. Here, we study how different ecological contexts influence the frequency of sex or parthenogenesis in the facultatively parthenogenetic mayfly Alainites muticus. We first verified that high parthenogenetic frequencies translate into female-biased population sex ratios. We then measured the population sex ratio (a proxy for parthenogenetic capacities), density of individuals (mate limitation) and community diversity (biotic interaction complexity) for 159 A. muticus populations, and used structural equation modeling to investigate their direct and indirect influences on sex ratios. We found no effect of community diversity or altitude on sex ratios. Furthermore, even when females can reproduce parthenogenetically, they generally reproduce sexually, indicating that the benefits of sex exceed its costs in most situations. Sex ratios become female-biased in low population densities, as expected if mate limitation selects for parthenogenesis. Mate limitation might be widespread in mayflies because of their very short adult lifespan and limited dispersal, which can generate strong selection for reproductive assurance and may provide a steppingstone towards obligate parthenogenesis.",

The roundjaw bonefish, Albula glossodonta is the most widespread bonefish species in the Indo-Pacific and is listed as vulnerable to extinction by the IUCNs Red List due to anthropogenic activities. Whole-genome datasets allow for improved population and species delimitation, which - prior to this study - were lacking for Albula species.\n\nResultsWe generated a high-quality genome assembly of an A. glossodonta individual from Hawai i, USA. The assembled contigs had an NG50 of 4.75 Mbp and a maximum length of 28.2 Mbp. Scaffolding yielded an NG50 of 14.49 Mbp, with the longest scaffold reaching 42.29 Mbp. Half the genome was contained in 20 scaffolds. The genome was annotated with 28.3 K protein-coding genes. We then analyzed 66 A. glossodonta individuals and 38,355 SNP loci to evaluate population genetic connectivity between six atolls in Seychelles and Mauritius in the Western Indian Ocean. We observed genetic homogeneity between atolls in Seychelles and evidence of reduced gene flow between Seychelles and Mauritius. The South Equatorial Current could be one mechanism limiting gene flow of A. glossodonta populations between Seychelles and Mauritius.\n\nConclusionsQuantifying the spatial population structure of widespread fishery species such as bonefishes is necessary for effective transboundary management and conservation. This population genomic dataset mapped to a high-quality genome assembly allowed us to discern shallow population structure in a widespread species in the Western Indian Ocean. The genome assembly will be useful for addressing the taxonomic uncertainties of bonefishes globally.",

Because waterbird movements are difficult to quantify, determining the host-specific risk of Eurasian-origin AI movements into North America is challenging. We estimated relative rates of movements, based on long-term evolutionary averages of gene flow, between Eurasian and North American waterbird populations to obtain bidirectional baseline rates of the intercontinental movements of these AI hosts. We used population genomics and coalescent-based demographic models to obtain these gene-flow-based movement estimates. Inferred rates of movement between these populations varies greatly among species. Within dabbling ducks, gene flow, relative to effective population size, varies from [~]3-24 individuals/generation between Eurasian and American wigeons (Mareca penelope - M. americana) to [~]100-300 individuals/generation between continental populations of northern pintails (Anas acuta). These are evolutionary long-term averages and provide a solid foundation for understanding the relative risks of each of these host species in potential intercontinental AI movements. We scale these values to census size for evaluation in that context. In addition to being AI hosts, many of these species are also important in the subsistence diets of Alaskans, increasing the risk of direct bird-to-human exposure to Eurasian-origin AI virus. We contrast species-specific rates of intercontinental movements with the importance of each species in Alaskan diets to understand the relative risk of these taxa to humans. Greater scaup (Aythya marila), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and northern pintail (Anas acuta) were the top three species presenting the highest risks for intercontinental AI movement both within the natural system and through exposure to subsistence hunters. These directly comparable, species-based intercontinental movement rates and relative risk rankings should help in modeling, monitoring, and mitigating the impacts of intercontinental host and AI movements.",

    "abstract": "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuropeptide capable of downregulating innate immune responses in antigen presenting cells (APCs) by suppressing their pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and cell surface marker expression. Though VIPs bioactivity could possibly be leveraged as a treatment for autoimmune disorders and transplant tolerance, drug delivery innovation is required to overcome its intrinsically limited cellular delivery capacity due to its short in vivo lifetime. One option is to employ peptide amphiphiles (PAs) which are lipidated peptides capable of self-assembling into micelles in water that can enhance cellular association. With this approach in mind, a series of triblock VIP amphiphiles (VIPAs) has been synthesized to explore the influence of block arrangement and hydrophobicity on micelle biocompatibility and bioactivity. VIPA formulation has been found to influence the shape, size, and surface charge of VIPA micelles (VIPAMs) as well as their cytotoxicity and immunomodulatory effects. Specifically, the enclosed work provides strong evidence that cylindrical VIPAMs with aspect ratios of 1.5 - 150 and moderate positive surface charge are able to potentiate the bioactivity of VIP limiting TNF- secretion and MHC II and CD86 surface expression on APCs. With this criteria, we have identified PalmK-(EK)4-VIP as our lead formulation, which showed comparable or enhanced anti-inflammatory effects relative to the unmodified VIP at all dosages evaluated. Additionally, the relationships between peptide block location and lipid block size provide further information on the chemistry-structure-function relationships of peptide amphiphile micelles for the delivery of VIP as well as potentially for other peptides more broadly.",

In this work, we seek to understand how genes involved in pathogenesis which are often not associated with the immune system in an obvious way communicate with the immune system. We have embedded a network of human protein-protein interactions (PPI) from the STRING database with 14,707 human genes using feature learning that captures high confidence edges. We have found that our predicted Association Scores derived from the features extracted from STRINGs high confidence edges are useful for predicting novel connections between genes, thus enabling the construction of a full map of predicted associations for all possible pairs between 14,707 human genes. In particular, we analyzed the pattern of associations for 126 cytokines and found that the six patterns of cytokine interaction with human genes are consistent with their functional classifications. In order to define the disease-specific roles of cytokines we have collected gene sets for 11,944 diseases from DisGeNET. We used these gene sets to predict disease-specific gene associations with cytokines by calculating the normalized average Association Scores between disease-associated gene sets and the 126 cytokines; this creates a unique profile of inflammatory genes (both known and predicted) for each disease. We validated our predicted cytokine associations by comparing them to known associations for 171 diseases. The predicted cytokine profiles correlate (p-value<0.05) with the known ones in 147 diseases. We further characterized the profiles of each disease by calculating an \"Inflammation Score\" that summarizes different modes of immune responses. Finally, by analyzing subnetworks formed between disease-specific pathogenesis genes, hormones, receptors, and cytokines, we identified the key genes responsible for interactions between pathogenesis and inflammatory responses. These genes and the corresponding cytokines used by different immune disorders suggest unique targets for drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Continuous progression in genomics shows that repeats are important elements of genomes that perform many regulatory and other functions. Eventually, to date, many computational tools have been developed and frequently used for the identification and analysis of genomic repeats. A single tool cannot detect all different types of repeats in diverse species rather pipeline of tools is more effective. But, the choice of such rigorous and robust tools is highly challenging. A method has been implemented to select a set of optimal tools for finding all available classes of perfect and imperfect tandem repeats including microsatellites, minisatellites, and interspersed CRISPRs in genomes. A total of 11 tools have been shortlisted using rule-based selection and then ranked by analyzing rigorousness in searching in diverse species and execution time. Tool comparison shows consistency in perfect microsatellite detection performance but significantly differ for long and imperfect repeats. A web-server has been built which provides a generic platform for various classes of repeat identification from the diverse genome using multiple tools and comparison.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Medtronic \"Percept\" is the first FDA approved deep brain stimulation (DBS) device with sensing capabilities during active stimulation. Its real-world signal recording properties have yet to be fully described.\n\nObjectiveThis study details sources of artifact (and potential mitigations) in local field potential (LFP) signals collected by the Percept, and assesses the potential impact of artifact on the future development of adaptive DBS (aDBS) using this device.\n\nMethodsLFP signals were collected from seven subjects in both experimental and clinical settings. The presence of artifacts and their effect on the spectral content of neural signals were evaluated in both the stimulation ON and OFF states using three distinct offline artifact removal techniques.\n\nResultsTemplate subtraction successfully removed multiple sources of artifact, including 1) electrocardiogram (ECG), 2) non-physiologic polyphasic artifacts, and 3) ramping related artifacts seen when changing stimulation amplitudes. ECG removal from stimulation ON (at 0 mA) signals recovered the spectral shape seen when OFF stimulation (averaged difference in normalized power in theta, alpha, and beta bands [&le;] 3.5%). ECG removal using singular value decomposition was similarly successful, though required subjective researcher input. QRS interpolation produced similar recovery of beta-band signal, but resulted in residual low-frequency artifact.\n\nConclusionsArtifacts present when stimulation is enabled notably affected the spectral properties of sensed signals using the Percept. Multiple discrete artifacts could be successfully removed offline using an automated template subtraction method. The presence of unrejected artifact likely influences online power estimates, with the potential to affect aDBS algorithm performance.",

    "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) gates alcohol self-administration in rodents. The major source of BDNF in the striatum is the cortex, and we recently found that BDNF-expressing neurons in the ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex (vlOFC) extend axonal projections to the DLS. We therefore hypothesized that BDNF in the vlOFC to DLS circuit moderates alcohol intake. We show that overexpression of BDNF in the vlOFC, which activates BDNF signaling in the DLS, is sufficient to attenuate voluntary consumption and seeking of 20% alcohol in the home cage using a two-bottle choice paradigm. Overexpressing BDNF in the vlOFC had no effect on the consumption of a sweetened saccharin solution. In addition, BDNF overexpression in the neighboring motor cortex did not alter alcohol intake. Finally, pathway-specific overexpression of BDNF in DLS-projecting vlOFC neurons significantly reduced alcohol intake and preference. Overall, BDNF in the vlOFC, and specifically in a vlOFC-DLS pathway, keeps alcohol drinking in moderation.",

TETact induces transcription of heavily suppressed non-coding RNA and surface protein, and the reactivation of embryonic haemoglobin genes in non-erythroid cells.",
