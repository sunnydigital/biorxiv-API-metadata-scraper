    "abstract": "After an experiment has been completed, a trend may be observed that is \"not quite significant\". Sometimes in this situation, researchers collect more data in an effort to achieve statistical significance. Such \"N-hacking\" is condemned because it can lead to an excess of false positive results. I use simulations to demonstrate how N-hacking causes false positives. However, in a parameter regime relevant for many experiments, the increase in false positives is quite modest. Moreover, results obtained this way have higher Positive Predictive Value than non-incremented experiments of the same sample size and statistical power. In other words, adding a few more observations to shore up a nearly-significant result can increase the reproducibility of results, counter to some current rhetoric. Many experiments are non-confirmatory, and unplanned sample augmentation with reasonable decision rules would not cause rampant irreproducibility in that context.",

    "abstract": "Classical models of perceptual decision-making assume that subjects use a single, consistent strategy to form decisions, or that strategies evolve slowly over time. Here we present new analyses suggesting that this common view is incorrect. We analyzed data from mouse and human decision-making experiments and found that choice behavior relies on an interplay between multiple interleaved strategies. These strategies, characterized by states in a hidden Markov model, persist for tens to hundreds of trials before switching, and may alternate multiple times within a session. The identified mouse decision-making strategies were highly consistent across individuals and comprised a single \"engaged\" state, in which decisions relied heavily on the sensory stimulus, and several biased states in which errors frequently occurred. These results provide a powerful alternate explanation for \"lapses\" often observed in rodent psychophysical experiments, and suggest that standard measures of performance mask the presence of dramatic changes in strategy across trials.",

    "abstract": "Sensory neurons with cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) represent a useful model to study axon regeneration. Whereas regeneration and functional recovery occurs after peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury or dorsal root injury is not followed by regenerative outcomes. Regeneration of sensory axons in peripheral nerves is not entirely cell autonomous. Whether the DRG microenvironment influences the different regenerative capacities after injury to peripheral or central axons remains largely unknown. To answer this question, we performed a single cell transcriptional profiling of mouse DRG in response to peripheral (sciatic nerve crush) and central axon injuries (dorsal root crush and spinal cord injury). Each cell type responded differently to the three types of injuries. All injuries increased the proportion of a cell type that shares features of both immune cells and glial cells. A distinct subset of satellite glial cells (SGC) appeared specifically in response to peripheral nerve injury. Activation of the PPAR signaling pathway in SGC, which promotes axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injury, failed to occur after central axon injuries. Treatment with the FDA-approved PPAR agonist fenofibrate increased axon regeneration after dorsal root injury. This study provides a map of the distinct DRG microenvironment responses to peripheral and central injuries at the single cell level and highlights that manipulating non-neuronal cells could lead to avenues to promote functional recovery after CNS injuries or disease.",

    "abstract": "Biological architecture is intrinsically tensorial. The permittivity tensor (PT) of biological material reports the density, angular anisotropy, symmetry, and 3D orientation of biomolecules. High-resolution measurement of PT can enable quantitative and label-free analysis of organelle, cell, and tissue architecture, but remains challenging. We report uniaxial permittivity tensor imaging (uPTI), a label-free computational imaging method for volumetric measurement of PT with diffraction-limited resolution. uPTI encodes the components of PT into intensity modulations using oblique illumination and polarization-resolved imaging. The high-dimensional data is decoded with a vectorial image formation model and a multi-channel convex optimization, assuming that the molecular distribution in each voxel has uniaxial symmetry. We describe a modular implementation of uPTI that can be multiplexed with complementary imaging modalities. We report volumes of uPT in mouse brain tissue, SARS-CoV-2 infected cardiomyocytes, RSV infected A549 cells, H&E stained tissue sections, isotropic beads, and anisotropic glass targets. uPTI enabled volumetric imaging of the 3D orientation and symmetry of organelles, cells, and tissue components with higher spatio-angular resolution than current vectorial tomography, ptychography, and light-field microscopy methods.

    "abstract": "In the laboratory, animals motivation to work tends to be positively correlated with reward magnitude. But in nature, rewards earned by work are essential to survival (e.g., working to find water), and the payoff of that work can vary on long timescales (e.g., seasonally). Under these constraints, the strategy of working less when rewards are small could be fatal. We found that instead, rats in a closed economy did more work for water rewards when the rewards were stably smaller, a phenomenon also observed in human labor supply curves. Like human consumers, rats also showed elasticity of demand, consuming far more water per day when its price in effort was lower. The neural mechanisms underlying such \"rational\" market behaviors remain largely unexplored. We propose a dynamic utility maximization model that can account for the dependence of rat labor supply (trials/day) on the wage rate (ml/trial), and also predict the temporal dynamics of when rats work. Based on data from mice, we hypothesize that SFOGLUT neurons in lamina terminalis continuously compute the instantaneous marginal utility of voluntary work for water reward, and causally determine the amount and timing of work.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that timing of sensory stimulation during the cardiac cycle interacts with perception. Given the natural coupling of respiration and cardiac activity, we investigated here their joint effects on tactile perception. Forty-one healthy female and male human participants reported conscious perception of finger near-threshold electrical pulses (33% null trials) and decision confidence while electrocardiography, respiratory activity, and finger photoplethysmography were recorded. Participants adapted their respiratory cycle to expected stimulus onsets to preferentially occur during late inspiration / early expiration. This closely matched heart rate variation (sinus arrhythmia) across the respiratory cycle such that most frequent stimulation onsets occurred during the period of highest heart rate probably indicating highest alertness and cortical excitability. Tactile detection rate was highest during the first quadrant after expiration onset. Inter-individually, stronger respiratory phase-locking to the task was associated with higher detection rates. Regarding the cardiac cycle, we confirmed previous findings that tactile detection rate was higher during diastole than systole and newly specified its minimum at 250 - 300 ms after the R-peak corresponding to the pulse wave arrival in the finger. Expectation of stimulation induced a transient heart deceleration which was more pronounced for unconfident decision ratings. Inter-individually, stronger post-stimulus modulations of heart rate were linked to higher detection rates. In summary, we demonstrate how tuning to the respiratory cycle and integration of respiratory-cardiac signals are used to optimize performance of a tactile detection task.\n\nSignificance statementMechanistic studies on perception and cognition tend to focus on the brain neglecting contributions of the body. Here, we investigated how respiration and heartbeat influence tactile perception: Respiration phase-locking to expected stimulus onsets corresponds to highest heart rate (and presumably alertness/cortical excitability) and correlates with detection performance. Tactile detection varies across the heart cycle with a minimum when the pulse reaches the finger and a maximum in diastole. Taken together with our previous finding of unchanged early ERPs across the cardiac cycle we conclude that these effects are not a peripheral physiological artifact but a result of cognitive processes that model our bodys internal state, make predictions to guide behavior, and might also tune respiration to serve the task.",

    "abstract": "Thermokarst lakes are forming from permafrost thaw and severely affected by accelerating climate change. Sediment and water in these lakes are distinct habitats but closely connected. However, our understanding of the differences and linkages between sediment and water in thermokarst lakes remain largely unknow, especially from the perspective of community assembly mechanisms. Here, we examined bacterial communities in sediment and water in thermokarst lakes in the Yellow River Source area, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Bacterial taxa were divided to abundant and rare according to their relative abundance, and the Sorensen dissimilarity ({beta}sor) was partitioned into turnover ({beta}turn) and nestedness ({beta}nest). The whole bacterial communities as well as the abundant and rare subcommunities differed substantially between sediment and water, in terms of taxonomical composition, -diversity, and {beta}-diversity. Sediment had significantly lower -diversity indexes but higher {beta}-diversity than water. Abundant taxa had significantly higher relative abundances but lower -diversity and {beta}-diversity than rare taxa. Moreover, bacterial communities are predominantly governed by strong turnover processes ({beta}turn/{beta}sor ratio of 0.925). Abundant subcommunities were significantly lower in {beta}turn/{beta}sor ratio compared to rare subcommunities. Bacterial communities in sediment had a significantly higher {beta}turn/{beta}sor ratio than in water. The results suggest that the bacterial communities of thermokarst lakes, especially rare subcommunities or particularly in sediment, might be strongly structured by environmental filtering and geographical isolation, leading to compositional distinct. This integral study increased our current knowledge of thermokarst lakes, enhancing our understanding of the community assembly rules and ecosystem structures and processes of these rapid changing and vulnerable ecosystems.",

We validated the usability and clustering performance of ASURAT using scRNA-seq datasets for human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which required fewer manual curations than existing methods. Moreover, we applied ASURAT to scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptome datasets for small cell lung cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, identifying previously overlooked subpopulations and differentially expressed genes.

    "abstract": "Field-deployable diagnostics based on cell-free systems have advanced greatly, but on-site quantification of target analytes remains a challenge. Here we demonstrate that Escherichia coli lysate-based cell-free biosensors coupled to a personal glucose monitor (PGM) can enable on-site analyte quantification, with the potential for straightforward reconfigurability to diverse types of analytes. We show that analyte-responsive regulators of transcription and translation can modulate production of the reporter enzyme {beta}-galactosidase, which in turn converts lactose into glucose for PGM quantification. Because glycolysis is active in the lysate and would readily deplete converted glucose, we decoupled enzyme production and glucose conversion to increase endpoint signal output. This lysate metabolism did, however, allow for one-pot removal of glucose present in complex samples (like human serum) without confounding target quantification. Taken together, we show that integrating lysate-based cell-free biosensors with PGMs enables accessible target detection and quantification at the point of need.\n\nTable of Contents Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=95 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/449464v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (18K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@100532forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@554ac4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19fa9d4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@146c729_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "While significant progress has been achieved in studying resting state functional networks in a healthy human brain and in a wide range of clinical conditions, many questions related to their relationship to the brains cellular constituents remain open. Herein we use quantitative Gradient-Recalled-Echo (qGRE) MRI for mapping human brain cellular composition, and BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) MRI to explore how the brain cellular constituents relate to resting state functional networks. Results show that the BOLD-signal-defined synchrony of connections between cellular circuits in network-defined individual functional units is mainly associated with the regional neuronal density, while the between-functional-units connectivity strength is also influenced by the glia and synaptic components of brain tissue cellular constituents. These mechanisms lead to a rather broad distribution of resting state functional networks properties. Visual networks with the highest neuronal density (but lowest density of glial cells and synapses) exhibit the strongest coherence of BOLD signal, as well as the strongest intra-network connectivity. The Default Mode Network (DMN) is positioned near the opposite part of the spectrum with relatively low coherence of the BOLD signal but a remarkably balanced cellular content enabling DMN prominent role in the overall organization of the brain and the hierarchy of functional networks.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how point mutations can render a ligand or a drug ineffective against a given biological target is a problem of immense fundamental and practical relevance. Often the efficacy of such resistance mutations can be explained purely on a thermo-dynamic basis wherein the mutated system displays a reduced binding affinity for the ligand. However, the more perplexing and harder to explain situation is when two protein sequences have the same binding affinity for a drug. In this work, we demonstrate how all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, specifically using recent developments grounded in statistical mechanics and information theory, can provide a detailed mechanistic rationale for such variances. We establish the dissociation mechanism for the popular anti-cancer drug Imatinib (Gleevec) against wild-type and N387S mutant of Abl kinase. We show how this single point mutation triggers a non-local response in the proteins flexibility and eventually leads to pathway differentiation during dissociation. This pathway differentiation explains why Gleevec has a long residence time in the wild-type Abl, but for the mutant, by opening up a backdoor pathway for ligand exit, an order of magnitude shorter residence time is obtained. We thus believe that this work marks an efficient and scalable approach to pinpoint the molecular determinants of resistance mutations in biomolecular receptors of pharmacological relevance that are hard to explain using a simple structural perspective and require mechanistic and kinetic insights.\n\nSignificance statementRelapse in late-stage cancer patients is often correlated with the onset of drug resistance mutations. Some of these mutations are very far from the binding site and thus hard to explain from a purely structural perspective. Here we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations aided by ideas from information theory that can reach timescales of seconds with minimal human bias in how the sampling is enhanced. Through these we explain how a single point mutation triggers a non-local response in the protein kinases flexibility and eventually leads to pathway differentiation during dissociation, thereby significantly reducing the residence time of the drug.",

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) shows elevated actin assembly dependence under high membrane tension. Why actin assembly at CME sites occurs heterogeneously even within the same cell, and how assembly forces are harnessed, are not fully understood. Here, endocytic dynamics, actin presence, and geometry of CME proteins from three different functional modules, were analyzed using three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution microscopy, live-cell imaging, and machine-learning-based computation. When hundreds of CME events were compared, sites with actin assembly showed a distinct signature, a delay between completion of coat expansion and vesicle scission, indicating that actin assembly occurs preferentially at stalled CME sites. N-WASP is recruited to one side of CME sites where it is positioned to stimulate asymmetric actin assembly. We propose that asymmetric actin assembly rescues stalled CME sites by pulling vesicles into the cell much like a bottle opener pulls off a bottle cap.",

    "abstract": "The detrimental effects of human-induced environmental change on people and other species are acutely manifested in urban environments. While urban greenspaces are known to mitigate these effects and support functionally diverse ecological communities, evidence of the ecological outcomes of urban greening remains scarce. We use a longitudinal observational design to provide empirical evidence of the putative ecological benefits of greening actions. We show how a small greening action quickly led to large positive changes in the richness, demographic dynamics, and network structure of a depauperate insect community. An increase in the diversity and complexity of the plant community led to, after only three years, a large increase in insect species richness, a greater probability of occurrence of insects within the greenspace, and a higher number and diversity of interactions between insects and plant species. We demonstrate how large ecological benefits may be derived from investing in small greening actions and how these contribute to bring indigenous species back to greenspaces where they have become rare or locally extinct. Our findings provide crucial evidence that support best practice in greenspace design and contribute to re-invigorate policies aimed at mitigating the negative impacts of urbanisation on people and other species.",

    "abstract": "Recent research demonstrates that Australia lags in providing open access to research outputs. In Australia, while the two major research funding bodies require open access of outputs from projects they fund, these bodies only fund a small proportion of research conducted. The major source of research and experimental development funding in Australian higher education is general university, or institutional, funding, and such funds are not subject to national funder open access policies. Thus, institutional policies and other institutional supports for open access are important in understanding Australias OA position. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to understand the characteristics of Australian institutional open access policies and to explore the extent they represent a coherent and unified approach to delivering and promoting open access in Australia. Open access policies were located using a systematic web search approach and then their contents were analysed. Only half of Australian universities were found to have an open access policy. There was a wide variation in language used, expressed intent of the policy and expectations of researchers. Few policies mention monitoring or compliance and only three mention consequences for non-compliance. While it is understandable that institutions develop their own policies, when language is used which does not reflect national and international understandings, when requirements are not clear and with consequences, policies are unlikely to contribute to understanding of open access, to uptake of the policy, or to ease of transferring understanding and practices between institutions. A more unified approach to open access is recommended.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHalophila stipulacea seagrass meadows are an ecologically important and threatened component of the ecosystem in the Gulf of Aqaba. Recent studies have demonstrated correlated geographic patterns for leaf endophytic community composition and leaf morphology, also coinciding with different levels of water turbidity and nutrient concentrations. Based on these observations, workers have suggested an environmental microbial fingerprint, which may reflect various environmental stress factors seagrasses have experienced, and may add a holobiont level of plasticity to seagrasses, assisting their acclimation to changing environments and through range expansion. However, it is difficult to tease apart environmental effects from host-diversity dependent effects, which have covaried in field studies, although this is required in order to establish that differences in microbial community compositions among sites are driven by environmental conditions rather than by features governed by the host.\n\nResultsIn this study we carried out a mesocosm experiment, in which we studied the effects of warming and nutrient stress on the composition of epiphytic bacterial communities and on some phenological traits. We studied H. stipulacea collected from two different meadows in the Gulf of Aqaba, representing differences in the host and the environment alike. We found that the source site from which seagrasses were collected was the major factor governing seagrass phenology, although heat increased shoot mortality and nutrient loading delayed new shoot emergence. Bacterial diversity, however, mostly depended on the environmental conditions. The most prominent pattern was the increase in Rhodobacteraceae under nutrient stress without heat stress, along with an increase in Microtrichaceae. Together, the two taxa have the potential to maintain nitrate reduction followed by an anammox process, which can together buffer the increase in nutrient concentrations across the leaf surface.\n\nConclusionsOur results thus corroborate the existence of environmental microbial fingerprints, which are independent from the host diversity, and support the notion of a holobiont level plasticity, both important to understand and monitor H. stipulacea ecology under the changing climate.",

    "abstract": "Speciation, the continuous process by which new species form, is often investigated by looking at the variation of nucleotide diversity and differentiation across the genome (hereafter genomic landscapes). A key challenge lies in how to determine the main evolutionary forces at play shaping these patterns. One promising strategy, albeit little used to date, is to comparatively investigate these genomic landscapes as a progression through time by using a series of species pairs along a divergence gradient. Here, we resequenced 201 whole-genomes from eight closely related Populus species, with pairs of species at different stages along the divergence gradient to learn more about speciation processes. Using population structure and ancestry analyses, we document extensive introgression between some species pairs, especially those with parapatric distributions. We further investigate genomic landscapes, focusing on within-species (nucleotide diversity and recombination rate) and among-species (relative and absolute divergence) summary statistics of diversity and divergence. We observe highly conserved patterns of genomic divergence across species pairs. Independent of the stage across the divergence gradient, we find support for signatures of linked selection (i.e., the interaction between natural selection and genetic linkage) in shaping these genomic landscapes, along with gene flow and standing genetic variation. We highlight the importance of investigating genomic patterns on multiple species across a divergence gradient and discuss prospects to better understand the evolutionary forces shaping the genomic landscapes of diversity and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing goal of the study of amyloids has been to characterize the structural basis of the rate-determining nucleating event. However, the ephemeral nature of that event has made it inaccessible to classical biochemistry, structural biology, and computational approaches. Here, we addressed that limitation by measuring the dependence of amyloid formation on concentration and conformational templates in living cells, whose volumes are sufficiently small to resolve the outcomes of independent nucleation events. We characterized numerous rationally designed sequence variants of polyglutamine (polyQ), a polypeptide that precipitates Huntingtons and other amyloid-associated neurodegenerative diseases when its length exceeds a characteristic threshold. This effort uncovered a pattern of approximately twelve Qs, only for polypeptides exceeding the clinical length threshold, that allow for amyloid nucleation to occur spontaneously within single polypeptides. Nucleation was inhibited by intermolecular phase separation. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we found that the pattern encodes a minimal steric zipper of interdigitated side chains. Lateral growth of the steric zipper competed with axial growth to produce \"pre-amyloid\" oligomers. By illuminating the structural mechanism of polyQ amyloid formation in cells, our findings reveal a potential molecular etiology for polyQ diseases, and may provide a roadmap for the design of new therapies.",

    "abstract": "The question of whether repeated studies bring more variability or less to our brain is a critical problem before scientist continue their further study about memory. In the past ten years, a series of neural pattern representation studies have found that under the condition of spaced learning, the neural pattern similarity(NPS) between two encoding stages increases, and the researchers claimed that these results support the idea that repeated studies bring more similarity along with repetition in our brain, which is conflicted with the encoding variability theory(Feng et al., 2019; Y. Lu et al., 2015; Xue et al., 2010, 2011a). However, we doubt this viewpoint because we think the difference between encoding processing cannot be used to represent the difference between memory states. In current experiments, we used a new experimental paradigm with a longer lag and elaboration learning task to test the encoding variability theory. By comparing the difference between neural pattern dissimilarity(NPDS1)(spaced learning - one-time learning) and NPDS2(massed learning - one-time learning) in the final test (retrieval) stage, we get the result that the NPDS1 was significantly greater than NPDS2 in the parietal lobe of 400ms and the right frontal lobe of 600ms, which is more fitting to the encoding variability mechanism. However, we believe that there is no contradiction between these two experimental evidences. On the contrary, we think they reflect different aspects of the process of spaced learning. We propose that the deficient processing in encoding stage exactly lead to less encoding variability in our memory. More importantly, this result gives us reason to double the paper published ten years ago in Science, which claimed repetition brings greater neural pattern similarity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMesenchymal Stem Cells can be activated and respond to different bacterial toxins. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and Shiga Toxin (Stx) are the two main bacterial toxins present in Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) that cause endothelial damage. In this work we aimed to study the response of iPSC-MSC to LPS and/or Stx and its effect on the restoration of injured endothelial cells.\n\nMethodsiPSC-MSC were used as a source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and Human Microvascular Endothelial Cells-1 (HMEC-1) as a source of endothelial cells. iPSC-MSC were treated or not with LPS and/or Stx. For some experiments, Conditioned Media (CM) were collected from each plate and incubated with an anti-Stx antibody to block the direct effect of Stx, or Polymyxin to block the direct effect of LPS. In CM from both treatments, anti-Stx and Polymyxin were used. Results are expressed as mean {+/-} S.E.M. Significant differences (p<0.05) were identified using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferronis Multiple comparison test.\n\nResultsThe results obtained showed that LPS induced a pro-inflammatory profile on iPSC-MSC, but not Stx, even though they expressed Gb3 receptor. Moreover, LPS induced on iPSC-MSC an increment in migration and adhesion to gelatin substrate. Also, the addition of CM of iPSC-MSC treated with LPS+Stx, decreased the capacity of HMEC-1 to close a wound, and did not favor the formation of new tubes. Proteomic analysis of iPSC-MSC treated with LPS and/or Stx revealed specific protein secretion patterns that support many of the functional results described here.\n\nConclusionsIn conclusion, these results suggest that iPSC-MSC activated by LPS acquired a pro-inflammatory profile that induces migration and adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins (ECM), but the combination LPS+Stx decreased the repair of endothelial damage. The importance of this work is that it provides knowledge to understand the context in which iPSC-MSC could benefit or not the restoration of tissue injury, taking into account that the inflammatory context in response to a particular bacterial toxin is relevant for iPSC-MSC immunomodulation.",

For the Drosophila testis we recently showed that pro niche cells, specified at disparate positions during early gonadogenesis, must assemble into one collective at the anterior of the gonad. We now find that Slit and FGF signals emanating from adjacent visceral mesoderm regulate assembly. In response to signaling, niche cells express islet, which we find is also required for niche assembly. Without signaling, niche cells specified furthest from the anterior are unable to migrate, remaining dispersed. Function of such niches is severely disrupted, with niche cells evading cell cycle quiescence, compromised in their ability to signal the incipient stem cell pool, and failing to orient stem cell divisions properly. Our work identifies both extrinsic signaling and intrinsic responses required for proper assembly and placement of the testis niche.",

    "abstract": "Cortical representations supporting many cognitive abilities emerge from underlying circuits comprised of several different cell types. However, cell type-specific contributions to rate and timing-based cortical coding are not well-understood. Here, we investigated the role of parvalbumin (PV) neurons in cortical complex scene analysis. Many complex scenes contain sensory stimuli which are highly dynamic in time and compete with stimuli at other spatial locations. PV neurons play a fundamental role in balancing excitation and inhibition in cortex and sculpting cortical temporal dynamics; yet their specific role in encoding complex scenes via timing-based coding, and the robustness of temporal representations to spatial competition, has not been investigated. Here, we address these questions in auditory cortex using a cocktail party-like paradigm, integrating electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulations, and a family of spike-distance metrics, to dissect PV neurons contributions towards rate and timing-based coding. We find that suppressing PV neurons degrades cortical discrimination of dynamic sounds in a cocktail party-like setting via changes in rapid temporal modulations in rate and spike timing, over a wide range of time-scales. Our findings suggest that PV neurons play a critical role in enhancing cortical temporal coding and reducing cortical noise, thereby improving representations of dynamic stimuli in complex scenes.\n\nSignificance StatementOne impressive example of sensory perception by the brain is its ability to analyze complex scenes, e.g., following what a friend is saying at a party amongst other speakers. Although some humans can solve this problem with relative ease, it remains very difficult for humans with a variety of impairments, e.g., hearing impairments, ADHD, and autism. The brain mechanisms underlying complex scene analysis remain poorly understood. Here, we recorded neural activity in auditory cortex in a complex auditory scene. When we suppressed PV neuron activity in auditory cortex, cortical performance decreased, and the timing of cortical responses was degraded. Our findings suggest that PV neurons improve the brains ability to analyze complex scenes by enhancing the timing of cortical responses while reducing cortical noise.",

We immunodepleted DHX15 to assess its involvement and although splicing efficiency decreases with reduced DHX15, A-complex accumulation incongruently increases. DHX15 depletion also results in the persistence of the atypical ATP-independent interaction between U2 snRNP and a minimal substrate that is otherwise destabilized in the presence of either ATP or GTP. These results lead us to hypothesize that DHX15 plays a quality control function in U2 snRNPs engagement with an intron. In efforts to identify the RNA target of DHX15, we determined that an extended polypyrimidine tract is not necessary for disruption of the atypical interaction between U2 snRNP and the minimal substrate. We also examined U2 snRNA by RNase H digestion and identified nucleotides in the branch binding region that become accessible with both ATP and GTP hydrolysis, again implicating a DEAH-enzyme. Together, our results demonstrate that multiple ATP-dependent rearrangements are likely involved in U2 snRNP addition to the spliceosome and that DHX15 can have an expanded role in splicing.",

    "abstract": "Many pathogenic bacteria produce protein toxins that target and perturb host cell membranes. The secreted -pore-forming toxins (-PFTs) cause membrane damage via pore formation. This study demonstrates a remarkable, hitherto unknown mechanism by an -PFT protein from Vibrio cholerae. As part of the MakA/B/E tripartite toxin, MakA is involved in membrane pore formation similar to other -PFTs. In contrast, MakA protein alone induces tube-like structures in the acidic lysosomal host cell compartment. In vitro studies unravel the dynamics of tubular growth, which occur in a pH-, lipid- and concentration-dependent manner. A 3.7-[A] cryo-electron microscopy structure of MakA filaments reveals a unique protein-lipid superstructure. In its active -PFT conformation, MakA embeds its transmembrane helices into a thin annular lipid bilayer and spirals around a central cavity. Our study provides molecular insights into a novel tubulation mechanism of an -PFT protein, revealing a new mode of action by a secreted bacterial toxin.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIntimal hyperplasia (IH) remains a major limitation in the long-term success of any type of revascularization. IH is due to vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dedifferentiation, proliferation and migration. The gasotransmitter Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) inhibits IH in pre-clinical models. However, there is currently no clinically approved H2S donor. Here we used sodium thiosulfate (STS), a clinically-approved source of sulfur, to limit IH.\n\nMethodsHypercholesterolemic LDLR deleted (LDLR-/-), WT or CSE-/- male mice randomly treated with 4g/L STS in the water bottle were submitted to focal carotid artery stenosis to induce IH. Human vein segments were maintained in culture for 7 days to induce IH. Further in vitro studies were conducted in primary human vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC).\n\nFindingsSTS inhibited IH in mice and in human vein segments. STS inhibited cell proliferation in the carotid artery wall and in human vein segments. STS increased polysulfides in vivo and protein persulfidation in vitro, which correlated with microtubule depolymerization, cell cycle arrest and reduced VSMC migration and proliferation.\n\nInterpretationSTS, a drug used for the treatment of cyanide poisoning and calciphylaxis, protects against IH in a mouse model of arterial restenosis and in human vein segments. STS acts as an H2S donor to limit VSMC migration and proliferation via microtubule depolymerization.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant FN-310030_176158 to FA and SD and PZ00P3-185927 to AL); the Novartis Foundation to FA; and the Union des Societes Suisses des Maladies Vasculaires to SD.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=118 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/459573v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c98479org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1863f0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1492ad7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9bca8a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIntimal hyperplasia (IH) is a complex process leading to vessel restenosis, a major complication following cardiovascular surgeries and angioplasties. Therapies to limit IH are currently limited. Pre-clinical studies suggest that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an endogenous gasotransmitter, limits restenosis. However, despite these potent cardiovascular benefits in pre-clinical studies, H2S-based therapeutics are not available yet. Sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) is an FDA-approved drug used for the treatment of cyanide poisoning and calciphylaxis, a rare condition of vascular calcification affecting patients with end-stage renal disease. Evidence suggest that thiosulfate may generate H2S in vivo in pre-clinical studies.\n\nAdded value of this studyHere, we demonstrate that STS inhibit IH in a surgical mouse model of IH and in an ex vivo model of IH in human vein culture. We further found that STS increases circulating polysulfide levels in vivo and inhibits IH via decreased cell proliferation via disruption of the normal cells cytoskeleton. Finally, using CSE knockout mice, the main enzyme responsible for H2S production in the vasculature, we found that STS rescue these mice from accelerated IF formation.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThese findings suggest that STS holds strong translational potentials to limit IH following vascular surgeries and should be investigated further.",

    "abstract": "Two component systems (TCS) are signalling pathways that allow bacterial cells to sense, respond and adapt to fluctuating environments. Among the classical TCS of Escherichia coli, YedVW has been recently showed to be involved in the regulation of msrPQ, encoding for the periplasmic methionine sulfoxide reductase system. In this study, we demonstrate that hypochlorous acid (HOCl) induces the expression of msrPQ in a YedVW dependant manner, whereas H2O2, NO and paraquat (a superoxide generator) do not. Therefore, YedV appears to be an HOCl-sensing histidine kinase. Based on this finding, we proposed to rename this system HypVW. Moreover, using a directed mutagenesis approach, we show that Met residues located in the periplasmic loop of HypV (formerly YedV) are important for its activity. Given that HOCl oxidizes preferentially Met residues, we bring evidences that HypV could be activated via the reversible oxidation of its methionine residues, thus conferring to MsrPQ a role in switching HypVW off. Based on these results, we propose that the activation of HypV by HOCl could occur through a Met redox switch. HypVW appears to be the first characterized TCS able to detect HOCl in E. coli. This study represents an important step in understanding the mechanisms of reactive chlorine species resistance in prokaryotes.\n\nIMPORTANCEUnderstanding molecularly how bacteria respond to oxidative stress is crucial to fight pathogens. HOCl is one of the most potent industrial and physiological microbiocidal oxidant. Therefore, bacteria have developed counterstrategies to survive HOCl-induced stress. Over the last decade, important insights into these bacterial protection factors have been obtained. Our work establishes HypVW as an HOCl-sensing two component system in Escherichia coli MG1655 which regulates the expression of the periplasmic HOCl-oxidized proteins repair system MsrPQ. Moreover we bring evidences suggesting that HOCl could activate HypV through a methionine redox switch.",

Despite progress in vaccine development, the rise of novel, increasingly infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants makes it clear that our response to the virus must continue to evolve along with it. The use of immunoinformatics provides an opportunity to rapidly and efficiently expand the tools at our disposal to combat the current pandemic and prepare for future outbreaks through epitope-based vaccine design. In this study, we validated and compared the currently available epitope prediction tools, and then used the best tools to predict T cell epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins for use in an epitope-based vaccine. We combined the mouse MHC affinity predictor and clinical predictors such as HLA affinity, immunogenicity, antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity and stability to select the highest quality CD8 and CD4 T cell epitopes for the common SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern suitable for further preclinical studies. We also identified variant-specific epitopes to more precisely target the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Cluster 5 and US variants. We then modeled the 3D structures of our top 4 N and S epitopes to investigate the molecular interaction between peptide-MHC and peptide-MHC-TCR complexes. Following in vitro and in vivo validation, the epitopes identified by this study may be used in an epitope-based vaccine to protect across all current variants, as well as in variant-specific booster shots to target variants of concern. Immunoinformatics tools allowed us to efficiently predict epitopes in silico most likely to prove effective in vivo, providing a more streamlined process for vaccine development in the context of a rapidly evolving pandemic.",

By performing comparative genome analysis of nidovirales that contain the family of coronaviruses, we traced the origin of proofreading, surprisingly to the eukaryotic antiviral component ZNFX1. This common recent ancestor contributes two zinc finger (ZnF) motifs that are unique to viral exonuclease, segregating them from DNA proof-readers. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that following acquisition, genomes of coronaviruses retained and further fine-tuned proofreading exonuclease, whereas related families harbor substitution of key residues in ZnF1 motif concomitant to a reduction in their genome sizes. Structural modelling followed by simulation suggests the role of ZnF in RNA binding. Key ZnF residues strongly coevolve with replicase, and the helicase involved in duplex RNA unwinding. Hence, fidelity of replication in coronaviruses is a result of convergent evolution, that enables maintenance of genome stability akin to cellular proofreading systems.",

    "abstract": "O_LIHeritable genetic variation among free-living animals or plants is essential for populations to respond to selection and adapt. It is therefore important to be able to estimate additive genetic variance VA, which can be obtained using a generalized linear mixed model known as the animal model. An underlying assumption of the standard animal model is that the study population is genetically unstructured, which is often unrealistic. In fact, admixture might be the norm rather than the exception in the wild, like in geographically structured populations, in the presence of (im)migration, or in re-introduction and conservation contexts. Unfortunately, animal model estimators may be biased in such cases. So-called genetic group animal models that account for genetically differentiated subpopulations have recently become popular, but methodology is currently only available for cases where relatedness among individuals can be estimated from pedigrees.\nC_LIO_LITo ensure that genetic group animal models with heterogeneous VA remain applicable to populations with genomic data but no pedigrees, there is a clear need to generalize these models to the case when exclusively genomic data is available. We therefore introduce such methodology for wild admixed systems by extending methods that were recently suggested in the context of plant breeding. Our extension relaxes the limiting assumptions that currently restrict their use to artificial breeding setups.\nC_LIO_LIWe illustrate the usefulness of the extended genomic genetic groups animal model on a wild admixed population of house sparrows resident in an island system in Northern Norway, where genome-wide data on more than 180 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is available to derive genomic relatedness. We compare our estimates of quantitative genetic parameters to those derived from a corresponding pedigree-based genetic groups animal model. The satisfactory agreement indicates that the new method works as expected.\nC_LIO_LIOur extension of the very popular animal model ensures that the upcoming challenges with increasing availability of genomic data for quantitative genetic studies of wild admixed populations can be handled. To make the method widely available to the scientific community, we offer guidance in the form of a tutorial including step-by-step instructions to facilitate implementation.\nC_LI",

We find that spike S1 is the focus of adaptive evolution, but also identify positively-selected mutations in other genes that are sculpting the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2. Adaptive changes in S1 accumulated rapidly, resulting in a remarkably high ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence that is 2.5X greater than that observed in HA1 at the beginning of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Many viral proteins, including multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins, are secreted via the endoplasmic reticulum, and viral particles are assembled and exported in ER-associated replication compartments. Viral coat proteins such as the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein are N-glycosylated at NxS/T sites as they enter the ER. N-glycosylated sites in many eukaryotic proteins are deglycosylated by the NGLY1/PNG-1 deglycosylation enzyme which also deamidates the N-glycosylated asparagine to aspartic acid, thus editing the target protein sequence. Proteomic analysis of mammalian cell lines has revealed deamidation of many host N-glycosylated asparagines to aspartic acid by NGLY1/PNG-1 on peptides that are presented by mammalian HLA for immune surveillance. The key client protein for NGLY1/PNG-1 deglycosylation and N to D protein editing was revealed by genetic analysis of C. elegans proteasome regulation to be the intact endoplasmic reticulum-transiting SKN-1A transcription factor. Strikingly, an analysis of cancer cell genetic dependencies for growth revealed that the mammalian orthologue of SKN-1A, NRF1 (also called NFE2L1) is required by a highly correlated set of cell lines as NGLY1/PNG-1, supporting that NGLY1/PNG-1 and NRF1 act in the same pathway. NGLY1/PNG-1 edits N-glycosylated asparagines on the intact SKN-1 protein as it is retrieved by ERAD from the ER to in turn activate the transcription of target proteasomal genes. The normal requirement for NGLY1/PNG-1 editing of SKN-1A can be bypassed by a genomic substituion of N to D in four NxS/T N-glycosylation motifs of SKN-1A. Thus NGLY1/PNG-1-mediated N to D protein editing is more than a degradation step for the key client protein for proteasomal homeostasis in C. elegans or tumor growth in particular mammalian cell lines, SKN-1A/NRF1. In addition, such N to D substitutions in NxS/T N-glycosylation motifs occur in evolution: N to D substitutions are observed in phylogenetic comparisons of SKN-1A between nematode species that diverged hundreds of millions of years ago or of the vertebrate NRF1 between disparate vertebrates. Genomic N to D mutations bypass the many steps in N-glycosylation in the ER and deglycosylation-based editing of N to D, perhaps based on differences in the competency of divergent species for various N-glycosylation or deglycosylation steps.\n\nWe surveyed the N-glycosylation sites in coronavirus proteins for such phylogenetic evidence for N to D protein editing in viral life cycles, and found evidence for preferential N to D residue substitutions in NxS/T N-glycosylation sites in comparisons of the genome sequences of hundreds of coronaviruses. This suggests that viruses use NGLY1/PNG-1 in some hosts, for example humans, to edit particular N-glycosylated residues to aspartic acid, but that in other hosts, often in bats, an N to D substitution mutation in the virus genome is selected. Single nucleotide mutations in Asp or Asn codons can produce viruses with N to D or D to N substitutions that might be selected in different animal hosts from the population of viral variants produced in any previous host. NGLY1/PNG-1 has been implicated in viral immunity in mammalian cell culture, favoring this hypothesis.\n\nBecause of the phylogenetic evidence that the NGLY1/PNG-1 editing of protein sequences has functional importance for SKN-1A/NRF1 and viruses, and because most immunization protocols do not address the probable editing and functional importance of N-glycosylated aspargines to aspartic acid in normal viral infections, we suggest that immunization with viral proteins engineered to substitute D at genomically encoded NxS/T sites of N-glycosylated viral proteins that show a high frequency of N to D substitution in viral phylogeny may enhance immunological response to peptide antigens. Such genomically-edited peptides would not require ER-localization for N-glycosylation or other cell compartment localization for NGLY1/PNG-1 N to D protein editing. In addition, such N to D edited protein vaccines could be produced in bacteria since N-glycosylation and deglycosylation which do not occur in bacteria would no longer be required to immunize with a D-substituted peptide. Bacterially-expressed vaccines would be much lower cost and with fewer failure modes than attenuated viral vaccines or recombinant animal viruses produced in chicken eggs, mammalian tissue culture cells, or delivered by mRNA vectors to the patient directly. Because N to D edited peptides are clearly produced by NGLY1/PNG-1, and may be and presented by mammalian HLA, such peptides may more robustly activate T-cell killing or B-cell maturation to mediate more robust viral immunity.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) genomes are composed of eight single-stranded RNA segments. Genetic exchange through reassortment of the segmented genomes often endows IAVs with new genetic characteristics, which may affect transmissibility and pathogenicity of the viruses. However, a comprehensive understanding of the reassortment history of IAVs remains lacking. To this end, we assembled 40296 whole-genome sequences of IAVs for analysis. Using a new clustering method based on Mean Pairwise Distances in the phylogenetic trees, we classified each segment of IAVs into clades. Correspondingly, reassortment events among IAVs were detected by checking the segment clade compositions of related genomes under specific environment factors and time period. We systematically identified 1927 possible reassortment events of IAVs and constructed their reassortment network. Interestingly, minimum spanning tree of the reassortment network reproved that swine act as an intermediate host in the reassortment history of IAVs between avian species and human. Moreover, reassortment patterns among related subtypes constructed in this study are consistent with previous studies. Taken together, our genome-wide reassorment analysis of all the IAVs offers an overview of the leaping evolution of the virus and a comprehensive network representing the relationships of IAVs.\n\nAvailabilitySource code freely available for download at https://github.com/ElevenStr/IAVreassortment, implemented in python.\n\nLead Contactbioren@163.com",

    "abstract": "The viral life cycle usurps host cellular factors, redirecting them from physiological functions to viral needs thereby revealing their \"moonlighting\" functions, disturbing cellular proteostasis, and increasing risk of specific, virus-associated protein misfolding diseases (PMD). Identifying such virus-repurposed host proteins therefore allow study of fundamental cellular events leading to associated \"sporadic\" PMD. Here, we identified a small molecule with unprecedented activity against neurotropic herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) modulating an allosteric site of Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF). The compound efficiently reduced HSV-1-mediated tau phosphorylation or aggregation in vitro and in vivo, even without HSV-1 infection. The lead compound specifically interacted with an oxidized conformer of MIF (oxMIF) from either recombinant MIF or post-mortem brain homogenates of patients with Alzheimers disease (AD). OxMIF thus participates in a host-viral interface connecting HSV-1 infection, and possibly other external stressors, with tau cellular pathology characteristic for PMD, including Alzheimes disease.",

    "abstract": "Secreted molecules called morphogens govern tissue patterning in a concentration-dependent manner. However, it is still unclear how reproducible patterning can be achieved with diffusing molecules, especially when patterning differentiation of a thin region. Wnt is a morphogen that organizes cardiac development; especially Wnt6 patterns the cardiogenic mesoderm to induce differentiation of a thin pericardium in Xenopus. It is, however, unclear how Wnt6 can pattern such a thin tissue. In this study, we reveal that a Wnt receptor, frizzled7, is expressed in a Wnt-dependent manner in the prospective heart region, and that this receptor-feedback is essential for shaping a steep gradient of Wnt. In addition, the feedback imparts robustness against fluctuations of Wnt ligand production and allows the system to reach a steady state quickly. We also found a Wnt antagonist sFRP1, which is expressed at the opposite side of Wnt source, accumulates on a novel type of heparan sulfate (HS), N-acetyl-rich HS, which is highly presented in the outer of cardiogenic mesoderm, achieving local inhibition of Wnt signaling by restricting sFRP1 spreading. These two intricate regulatory systems restrict Wnt signaling and ensure reproducible patterning of a thin pericardium tissue.",

    "abstract": "Energy production and utilization is critically important for animal development and growth. How it is regulated in space and time during tissue growth remains largely unclear. Toward this end, we used a FRET-based adenosine triphosphate (ATP) sensor to dynamically monitor ATP levels across a growing tissue, using the Drosophila wing disc. We discovered that steady-state levels of ATP are spatially uniform across the wing pouch. Pharmacologically inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation, however, reveals spatial heterogeneities in metabolic behavior, whereby signaling centers at compartment boundaries produce more ATP from glycolysis than the rest of the tissue. Genetic perturbations indicate that the conserved Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway can enhance ATP production by glycolysis. Collectively, our work reveals a positive feedback loop between Hh signaling and energy metabolism, advancing our understanding of the connection between conserved developmental patterning genes and energy production during animal tissue development.",

    "abstract": "RAS is the most commonly mutated oncogene in human cancers and RAS-driven tumors are amongst the most difficult to treat. Historically, discovery of therapeutics targeting this protein has proven challenging due to a lack of deep hydrophobic pockets to which a small molecule might bind. The single such pocket available is normally occupied by GDP or GTP which have millimolar cellular concentrations and picomolar affinities for KRAS and hence is challenging to target. The recent FDA approval of sotorasib, a covalent modifier of the KRASG12C mutant protein, has clinically validated KRAS as an oncology target. However, traditional challenges remain for targeting the more common KRAS mutations such as G12D and G12V. As an alternative approach, we investigated the superior binding capacity of macrocyclic peptides to identify KRAS inhibitory molecules. We focused on the recently reported disulfide-cyclized arginine-rich peptide KRpep-2d, discovered through phage display and previously independently confirmed by us as a bona fide KRAS binder. To mitigate intracellular disulfide reduction and loss of binding, we identified an alternate cyclization motif by inverting the configuration of Cys5 and linking it to Cys15 through a thioacetal bridge. The corresponding peptide bound KRAS through cis isomerization of the peptide bond between D-Cys5 and Pro6 as observed through x-ray crystallography. Prototypic molecules displayed measurable cellular inhibition of RAS signaling without membrane lysis and counter-screen off-target activity. An analogue containing azido-lysine confirmed the cell penetrant nature of this molecule using our recently reported NanoClick assay. To improve cellular activity, we sought to improve proteolytic stability. Structure-activity relationship studies identified key scaffold residues critical for binding and revealed that replacement of N- and C-terminal arginine residues with D-arginines and introduction of an -methyl moiety at Ser10 resulted in a molecule with improved proteolytic stability as indicated by its persistence in whole cell homogenate. The resulting peptide MP-3995 had improved and sustained cell-based efficacy. On-target activity was validated through confirmation of target engagement, lack of signaling in irrelevant pathways, and use of non-binding control peptides. Mechanism of action studies suggested that peptide binding to both GDP- and GTP-states of KRAS may contribute to cellular activity. Although validated as bona fide and on-target inhibitors of cell based KRAS signaling, this series is unlikely to advance to the clinic in its current form due to its arginine-dependent cell entry mechanism. Indeed, we showed a strong correlation between net positive charge and histamine release in an ex vivo assay making this series challenging to study in vivo. Nonetheless, these molecules provide valuable templates for further medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at leveraging this unique inhibitory binding site on KRAS.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=118 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/459913v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17f4764org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12818daorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@177bdf0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@57046c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, pharmacological targeting of WAT inflammation lacks durable therapeutic effects. Through a computational screen, we identified the FDA-approved rheumatoid arthritis drug auranofin is a putative small molecule for obesity treatment. We discovered that allometrically scaled safe auranofin doses homed to WAT and improved insulin sensitivity in obese wild-type mice. Auranofin treatment also normalized other obesity-associated abnormalities, including hepatic steatosis and hyperinsulinemia. Surprisingly, the anti-diabetic effects of auranofin required leptin lowering and beta-adrenergic receptors in WAT. These metabolic benefits of leptin reduction were superior to any immune impacts of auranofin in WAT. Our studies reveal important metabolic properties of anti-inflammatory treatments and contribute to the notion that leptin reduction in the periphery can be accomplished to treat obesity and T2D.",

    "abstract": "A longstanding goal of biology is to identify the key genes and species that critically impact evolution, ecology, and health. Yet biological interactions between genes (1, 2), species (3-6), and different environmental contexts (7-9) change the individual effects due to non-additive interactions, known as epistasis. In the fitness landscape concept, each gene/organism/environment is modeled as a separate biological dimension (10), yielding a high dimensional landscape, with epistasis adding local peaks and valleys to the landscape. Massive efforts have defined dense epistasis networks on a genome-wide scale (2), but these have mostly been limited to pairwise, or two-dimensional, interactions (11). Here we develop a new mathematical formalism that allows us to quantify interactions at high dimensionality in genetics and the microbiome. We then generate and also reanalyze combinatorically complete datasets (two genetic, two microbiome). In higher dimensions, we find that key genes (e.g. pykF) and species (e.g. Lactobacillus plantarum) distort the fitness landscape, changing the interactions for many other genes/species. These distortions can fracture a \"smooth\" landscape with one optimal fitness peak into a landscape with many local optima, regulating evolutionary or ecological diversification (12), which may explain how a probiotic bacterium can stabilize the gut microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Habituated animals retain a latent capacity for robust engagement with familiar stimuli. In most instances, the ability to override habituation is best explained by postulating that habituation arises from the potentiation of inhibitory inputs onto stimulus-encoding assemblies and that habituation override occurs through disinhibition. Previous work has shown that inhibitory plasticity contributes to specific forms of olfactory and gustatory habituation in Drosophila. Here we analyze how exposure to a novel stimulus causes override of gustatory (proboscis-extension reflex or \"PER\") habituation. While brief sucrose contact with tarsal hairs causes naive Drosophila to extend their proboscis, persistent exposure reduces PER to subsequent sucrose stimuli. We show that in so habituated animals, either brief exposure of the proboscis to yeast or direct thermogenetic activation of sensory neurons restores PER response to tarsal sucrose stimulation. Similar override of PER habituation can also be induced by brief thermogenetic activation of a population of TH (Tyrosine-Hydroxylase) positive neurons, a subset of which send projections to the subesophagial zone (SEZ). Significantly, sensory-neuron induced habituation override requires transmitter release from these TH-positive cells. Treatments that cause override specifically influence the habituated state, with no effect on the naive sucrose response across a range of concentrations. Taken together with other findings, these observations in female flies are consistent with a model in which novel taste stimuli trigger activity in dopaminergic neurons which, directly or indirectly, inhibit GABAergic cells that drive PER habituation. The implications of these findings for general mechanisms of attentional and sensory override of habituation are discussed.",

    "abstract": "In bacteria, the mechanisms used to repair DNA lesions during genome replication include homologous recombination between sister chromosomes. This can lead to the formation of chromosome dimers if an odd number of crossover events occurs. The concatenated DNA must be resolved before cell separation to ensure genomic stability and cell viability. The broadly conserved dif/Xer system counteracts the formation of dimers by catalyzing one additional crossover event immediately prior to cell separation. While dif/Xer systems have been characterized or predicted in the vast majority of proteobacteria, no homologs to dif or xer have been identified in the order Legionellales. Here we report the discovery of a distinct single-recombinase dif/Xer system in the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila. The dif site was uncovered by our analysis of Legionella mobile element-1 (LME-1), which harbors a dif site-mimic and integrates into the L. pneumophila genome via site-specific recombination. We demonstrate that lpg1867 (herein named xerL) encodes a tyrosine recombinase that is necessary and sufficient for catalyzing recombination at the dif site, and that deletion of dif or xerL causes filamentation along with extracellular and intracellular growth defects. We show that the dif/XerL system is present throughout Legionellales and that Coxiella burnetii XerL and its cognate dif site can functionally substitute for the native system in L. pneumophila. Lastly, we describe an unexpected link between C. burnetii dif/Xer and the maintenance of its virulence plasmids.\n\nSignificance StatementThe maintenance of circular chromosomes depends on the ability to resolve aberrant chromosome dimers as they form. In most proteobacteria, broadly conserved Xer recombinases catalyze single crossovers at short, species-specific dif sites located near the replication terminus. Chromosomal dimerization leads to the formation of two copies of dif, leading to rapid site-specific recombination and elimination of the duplicated intervening sequence. The apparent absence of chromosome-dimer resolution mechanisms in Legionellales has been a mystery to date. By studying a phage-like mobile genetic element, LME-1, we have identified a previously unknown single-recombinase dif/Xer system that is not only widespread across Legionellales but whose activity is linked to virulence in two important human pathogens.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionKlebsiella pneumoniae is recognized as an urgent threat to human health because of the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and hypervirulent strains. Development of novel highly effective and safe treatment options is the need of the hour. One of the ways of achieving this goal is by conducting molecular characterization studies of antibiotic resistant bacteria.\n\nHypothesis/Gap StatementThe government of India is committed to generate validated AMR data from different parts of the country. Efforts are being made to perform molecular characterization of MDR and potentially virulent bacteria by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). However, the data that we have at present is skewed as many parts of the country remain underrepresented. Uttarakhand is one such state located in the Himalay an belt of India, with relatively poor access to healthcare and a paucity of research.\n\nAimThis study was performed to generate WGS based preliminary data about the population structure, multi-locus sequence types (MLST), and virulence factors of CRKp isolates recovered from patients in a tertiary care teaching hospital and institute of national importance, located in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India.\n\nMethodologyA cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care teaching hospital. It included twenty-nine randomly selected and archived carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-Kp) isolates obtained from various clinical samples submitted in the Bacteriology laboratory for culture and sensitivity testing, from July 2018 to August 2019. After preliminary identification (ID) and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST), as per standard guidelines, these isolates were sent to Central Research Laboratory (CRL), Bengaluru, India, for further characterization & WGS.\n\nResultsTwenty-seven out of twenty-nine test isolates were CRKp. Among the 27 CRKp isolates, ST14 was the most common sequence type (8, 29.6%), followed by ST231 (5, 18.5%) and ST147(3, 11.1%) respectively. KL2 (9/27, 33.3%) and KL51 (8/27, 29.6%) were dominant K loci types in this study. Out of 5 O antigens identified, O1 and O2 together accounted for 88.9% (n=27) CRKp isolates. Yersiniabactin and Aerobactin were identified in 88.9% (24/27) & 29.6% (8/27) of the CRKp isolates of the isolate. Regulatory genes rmpA2 and rmpADC were found in 14.8% (4/27) and 3.7% (1/27) isolates respectively. The predominant plasmid replicons present were ColKP3 (55.5%), IncFII(K) (51.8%), IncFIB(pQil) (44.4%), IncFIB(K) (37%), IncR (33.3%) and Col44 0I (18.5%) respectively. A perfect agreement (100%) was observed between phenotypic and genotypic resistance profiles in the case of fluoroquinolones, penicillins, Beta Lactam/Beta Lactam Inhibitor combinations (BL/BLI), and cephalosporins respectively. As compared to phenotypic resistance, higher genotypic resistance for aminoglycosides (96.3%) and folate pathway inhibitors (92.6%) respectively, was observed.\n\nConclusionThis study emphasizes the need for continued genomic surveillance of emerging CRKp and other MDR bacteria in Uttarakhand and neighbouring states of India. This in turn would help in generating critical information that can be used to assess the emergence, dissemination, and potential impact of important variants.",

This study aimed to screen the antimicrobial potential of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of thirteen (13) samples (Bark, leaf, seed) of eight (8) plants from Cameroon against 3 reference pathogens and to evaluate their synergy with conventional antibiotics against eleven (11) multiresistant uropathogenic (MRU) bacteria.\n\nMethodBioactive compounds were extracted from leaves of Leucanthemum vulgare, Cymbopogon citratus (DC.) Stapf, Moringa oleifera Lam and Vernonia amygdalina Delile; barks of Cinchona officinalis and Enantia chlorantha Oliv; barks and seeds of Garcinia lucida Vesque and leaves and seeds of Azadirachta indica (Neem) using distilled water and ethanol as solvents. The extracts were tested against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and Candida albicans 10231 using the well diffusion method and the microdilution method.

Only the EE of E. chloranta bark (ECB) had a strong activity against all the microorganisms tested (MIC <2 mg / ml); L. vulgare leaves (LVL) and G. lucida seed (GLS) had moderate (average MIC of 8 mg/ml) while all other extracts showed very weak antimicrobial activity. In addition, the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) ranged from 0.125 to 0.750. No antagonism (FIC> 4) or indifference (1[&le;] FIC[&le;]4) was noted between the extracts and the antibiotics, but the best synergies were found with ECB which well-modulated Kanamycin (FIC = 0.125 against S. aureus and 0.250 against E. coli), nitrofurantoin (FIC = 0.250 against S. aureus and 0.188 against E. coli) and ampicillin (FIC = 0.125 against E. coli). Similarly, compared to other extracts, ECB, LVL and GLS also well-modulated ampicillin, ceftazidime, tetracycline, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim against all the above-mentioned resistant uropathogenic bacteria with important increase in fold area (IFA).\n\nConclusionThis study show that E. chlorantha bark, L. vulgare leaves G. lucida seed, have good antimicrobial activity against both bacteria (Gram positive and Gram negative) and fungi (C. albicans); and should be more investigated for their possible use to the fight against MDR and MRU microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "The production of bioactive metabolites is increasingly recognized as an important function of host-associated bacteria. An example is defensive symbiosis that might account for much of the chemical richness of marine invertebrates including sponges (Porifera), one of the oldest metazoans. However, as most complex microbiomes remain largely uncultivated and lack reference genomes, unequivocally linking metabolic functions to a cellular source is a challenge. Here we report an analysis pipeline of microfluidic encapsulation, Raman microscopy, and integrated digital genomics (MERMAID) for an efficient identification of uncultivated producers. We applied this method to the chemically rich bacteriosponge Theonella swinhoei, previously shown to contain  Entotheonella symbionts providing most of its bioactive substances except for the antifungal aurantosides that lacked biosynthetic gene candidates in the metagenome. Raman-guided single-bacterial analysis and sequencing revealed a cryptic, distinct multiproducer,  Candidatus Poriflexus aureus from a new Chloroflexi lineage. Its exceptionally large genome contains numerous biosynthetic loci and suggested an even higher chemical richness of this sponge than previously appreciated. This study highlights the importance of complementary technologies to uncover microbiome functions, reveals remarkable parallels between distantly related symbionts of the same host, and adds functional support for diverse chemically prolific lineages being present in microbial dark matter.\n\nSignificance StatementThe production of bioactive metabolites is increasingly recognized as an important function of host-associated bacteria. However, the acquisition of integrated genomic and metabolic data from uncultivated environmental bacteria is still challenging. In this work, we explored the combination of Raman microscopy and single-cell sequencing to localize chemical features to a specific bacterium in an uncultivated microbiome, and we specified the bacteria in the uncultured lineage as a producer of aurantoside, an antifungal natural product, from a chemically and microbially complex sponge. This study offers a new methodology as well as insights into chemical functions of uncultivated life.",

    "abstract": "The maturation of neurons and the development of synapses - while emblematic of neurons - also rely on interactions with astrocytes and other glia. To study the role of glia-neuron interactions, we analyzed the transcriptomes of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neurons, from a total of 80 human donors, that were cultured with or without contact with glial cells. We found that the presence of astrocytes enhanced synaptic gene-expression programs in neurons. These changes in neuronal synaptic gene expression correlated with increased expression in the co-cultured glia of genes that encode synaptic cell adhesion molecules, and they were greatly enhanced in the glia in coculture. Both the neuronal and astrocyte gene-expression programs were enriched for genes that are linked to schizophrenia risk. Physical contact between the two cell types was required for the induction of synaptic programs in neurons. Our results suggest that astrocyte-expressed genes with synaptic functions are associated with stronger expression of synaptic genetic programs in neurons and suggest a potential role for astrocyte-neuron interactions in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDNA methylation plays an important role in regulating gene expression in mammals. The covalent DNMT1 inhibitors 5-azacytidine and decitabine are widely used in research to reduce DNA methylation levels, but they impart severe cytotoxicity which limits their demethylation capability and confounds interpretation of experiments. Recently, a non-covalent inhibitor of DNMT1 called GSK-3484862 was developed by GlaxoSmithKline. We sought to determine whether GSK-3484862 can induce demethylation more effectively than 5-azanucleosides. Murine embryonic stem cells (mESC) are an ideal cell type in which to conduct such experiments, as they have a high degree of DNA methylation but tolerate dramatic methylation loss.\n\nResultsWe determined the cytotoxicity and optimal concentration of GSK-3484862 by treating wild-type (WT) or Dnmt1/3a/3b triple knockout (TKO) mESC with different concentrations of the compound, which was obtained from two commercial sources. Concentrations of 10 {micro}M or below were readily tolerated for 14 days of culture. Known DNA methylation targets such as germline genes and GLN-family transposons were upregulated within two days of the start of GSK-3484862 treatment. By contrast, 5-azacytidine and decitabine induced weaker upregulation of methylated genes and extensive cell death. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) showed that treatment with GSK-3484862 induced dramatic DNA methylation loss, with global CpG methylation levels falling from near 70% in WT mESC to less than 18% after 6 days of treatment with GSK-3484862, similar to the methylation level observed in Dnmt1 deficient mESCs.\n\nConclusionsGSK-3484862 mediates striking demethylation in mESCs with minimal non-specific toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Kinetochores are macromolecular protein assemblies that attach sister chromatids to spindle microtubules and mediate accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis. The outer kinetochore consists of the KMN network, a protein super-complex comprising Knl1 (yeast Spc105), Mis12 (yeast Mtw1), and Ndc80 (yeast Ndc80), which harbors sites for microtubule binding. Within the KMN network, Spc105 acts as an interaction hub of components involved in spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) signaling. It is known that Spc105 forms a complex with kinetochore component Kre28. However, where Kre28 physically localizes in the budding yeast kinetochore is not clear. The exact function of Kre28 at the kinetochore is also unknown. Here, we investigate how Spc105 and Kre28 interact and how they are organized within bioriented yeast kinetochores using genetics and cell biological experiments. Our microscopy data show that Spc105 and Kre28 localize at the kinetochore with a 1:1 stoichiometry. We also show that the Kre28-Spc105 interaction is important for Spc105 protein turn-over and essential for their mutual recruitment at the kinetochores. We created several truncation mutants of kre28 that affect Spc105 loading at the kinetochores. When over-expressed, these mutants sustain the cell viability, but SAC signaling and kinetochore biorientation are impaired. Therefore, we conclude that Kre28 contributes to chromosome biorientation and high-fidelity segregation at least indirectly by regulating Spc105 localization at the kinetochores.",

However, our results with siRNAs targeting MKLP2 and small molecule inhibitors of MKLP2 (MKLP2i) suggested a function earlier in mitosis, prior to anaphase. In this study we provide direct evidence that MKLP2 facilitates chromosome congression in prometaphase. We employed live imaging to observe HeLa cells with fluorescently tagged histones treated with MKLP2i and discovered a pronounced chromosome congression defect. We show that MKLP2 is essential for pole-based error correction as inhibited cells had a significant increase in unstable kinetochore-microtubule attachments due to impaired error correction of syntelic attachments. We propose that MKLP2 mediates kinetochore microtubule attachment stability by regulating Aurora Kinase activity and a downstream target, pHEC1 (Ser 55). Lastly, we show that MKLP2 inhibition results in aneuploidy, confirming that MKLP2 safeguards cells against chromosomal instability.\n\nSummarySchrock et al. demonstrate that the mitotic kinesin, MKLP2, is required for congression of chromosomes located near the spindle poles. They show that MKLP2 inhibition causes elevated active Aurora Kinase A, unstable microtubule kinetochore attachments, and impaired syntelic error correction.",

    "abstract": "Increased intracellular iron spurs mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration to satisfy high-energy demand during osteoclast differentiation and bone-resorbing activities. Transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) mediates cellular iron uptake through endocytosis of iron-loaded transferrin and its expression increases during osteoclast differentiation. Nonetheless, the precise functions of TFR1 and TFR1-mediated iron uptake in osteoclast biology and skeletal homeostasis remain incompletely understood. To investigate the role of TFR1 in osteoclast lineage cells, we conditionally deleted Tfr1 gene in myeloid precursors or mature osteoclasts by crossing Tfr1- floxed mice with LysM-Cre and Ctsk-Cre mice, respectively. Skeletal phenotyping by {micro}CT and histology unveiled that loss of Tfr1 in osteoclast progenitor cells resulted in a three-fold increase in trabecular bone mass in the long bones of 10-week old female but not male mice. Although high trabecular bone volume in long bones was seen in both male and female mice with deletion of Tfr1 in mature osteoclasts, this phenotype was more pronounced in female knockout mice. Mechanistically, disruption of Tfr1 expression attenuated mitochondrial metabolism and cytoskeletal organization in mature osteoclasts, leading to decreased bone resorption with no impact on osteoclastogenesis. These results indicate that Tfr1-mediated iron uptake is specifically required for osteoclast function and is indispensable for bone remodeling.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWIn the simplest phylogenetic diversification model (the pure-birth Yule process), lineages split independently at a constant rate {lambda} for time t. The length of a randomly chosen edge (either interior or pendant) in the resulting tree has an expected value that rapidly converges to [Formula] as t grows, and thus is essentially independent of t. However, the behaviour of the length L of the longest pendant edge reveals remarkably different behaviour: L converges to t/2 as the expected number of leaves grows. Extending this model to allow an extinction rate  (where  < {lambda}), we also establish a similar result for birth-death trees, except that t/2 is replaced by t/2 {middle dot} (1 - /{lambda}). This  complete tree may contain subtrees that have died out before time t; for the  reduced tree that just involves the leaves present at time t and their direct ancestors, the longest pendant edge length L again converges to t/2. Thus, there is likely to be at least one extant species whose associated pendant branch attaches to the tree approximately half-way back in time to the origin of the entire clade. We also briefly consider the length of the shortest edges. Our results are relevant to phylogenetic diversity indices in biodiversity conservation, and to quantifying the length of aligned sequences required to correctly infer a tree. We compare our theoretical results with simulations, and with the branch lengths from a recent phylogenetic tree of all mammals.",

Using demographic modelling based on genomic data we show that whitefish morphs evolved during a phase of strict isolation, refuting a rapid symmetric speciation scenario. The lake is now an artificial hybrid zone between morphs originated in allopatry. Despite their current syntopy, clear genetic differentiation remains between two of the three morphs. Using admixture mapping three quantitative trait loci associated with gonad weight variation, a proxy for sexual maturity and spawning time, were identified. We suggest that ecological adaptations in spawning time evolved in allopatry are currently maintaining partial reproductive isolation in the absence of other barriers to gene flow.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian cells, there exist approximately 40 types of microtubule motor proteins that are assigned to specific cargo deliveries. For example, the kinesin-1 family motor KIF5 is the major motor responsible for anterograde mitochondrial transport, whereas the kinesin-3 family motor KIF1A is responsible for synaptic vesicle precursor transport. In contrast, cytoplasmic dynein is responsible for retrograde transport of nearly all cargos. The force and velocity of these microtubule motors have been investigated in in-vitro single-molecule experiments. In the present study, we compared the intracellular force and velocity of various types of motors in the mammalian neuronal axon obtained by non-invasive force measurement (fluctuation analysis) and extreme value analysis with those obtained by previous single-molecule experiments. As we found a high correlation between our results and the previous results, we next investigated synaptic vesicle precursor transport by hereditary spastic paraplegia-associated KIF1A variants (V8M, R350G, and A255V). KIF1A-V8M and KIF1A-A255V exhibited force and velocity impairment in mammalian neuronal axons, whereas the physical property of KIF1A-R350G was similar to that of the wild type. We believe that the development of new analytical techniques for investigating intracellular cargo transports is helpful to elucidate the molecular mechanism of KIF1A-associated neurological disorders.\n\nStatement of SignificanceRecent in-vitro single-molecule experiments have clearly revealed that microtubule motors only fully exert their functions when fully equipped with the proteins associated with cargo vesicle transport. This emphasizes the significance of intracellular physical measurements, in which the motors should fully function. In addition to motor force and velocity, the number of motors transporting a single cargo together is an important physical quantity to characterize cargo transport, but is difficult to estimate using in-vitro single-molecule experiments. In this study, we aimed to extract physical information on microtubule motors in the intracellular environment.",

FRET, with its high sensitivity to molecular distances, serves as a well-known \"nanoruler\" to monitor intramolecular changes. Taken together, conformational changes and key parameters such as local receptor concentrations, and mobility constants become accessible in cellular settings.\n\nQuantitative fluorescence approaches are challenging in cells due to high noise levels and the vulnerable sample itself. We will show how to perform the experiments including the calibration steps. We use dual-color labeled {beta}2-adrenergic receptor ({beta}2AR) labeled (eGFP and SNAPtag-TAMRA). We will guide you step-by-step through the data analysis procedure using open-source software and provide templates that are easy to customize.\n\nOur guideline enables researchers to unravel molecular interactions of biomolecules in live cells in situ with high reliability despite the limited signal-to-noise levels in live cell experiments.

    "abstract": "Grade IV neoplasm of the central nervous system, GBM, is associated with poor prognosis and relatively short overall survival. Due to the current limitations in treatment methods, GBM is characterized as an incurable disease, and research to advance therapeutic options is required. Conditioned medium is commonly used in in-vitro studies complementary to animal experiments to simulate tumor microenvironment and has the potential to challenge and expand our current understanding of secretome effect on tumor characteristics. This study aimed to investigate the effects of conditioned mediums of GBM cell lines on each other. Conditioned mediums cellular and molecular effects were evaluated using commonly employed techniques such as MTT assay, colony formation assay, wound healing assay, EdU labeling-based flow cytometry, and qRT-PCR. Our study demonstrated that conditioned medium harvested from U87 or LN229 cells at 48th h exhibited an anti-growth activity on each other by changing the gene expression pattern. Furthermore, the conditioned medium of LN229 decreased the migration capacity of U87 cells, and the conditioned medium of U87 cells significantly suppressed the LN229 proliferation. We believe that this initial work provides new insights for a better understanding of GBM cell lines secretome roles and highlights the necessity of further studies to unveil the secretome content.\n\nHighlightsO_LIConditioned medium harvested from GBM cells at different time points displayed various effects.\nC_LIO_LIConditioned medium of GBM cell lines harvested at 48th h decreased the viability of each other.\nC_LIO_LIThe expression level of anti-and pro-proliferative genes is altered upon condition medium treatment.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The theory that lesions formed by retention of circulating LDL can then progress to complicated atherosclerotic lesions has been a subject of debate, as has the mechanism of retention. In earlier work, we identified SAMD1, a protein expressed by intimal smooth muscle cells in human lesions that appears to irreversibly bind apoB-Lps in extracellular matrix near the lumen. We hypothesized this binding could contribute to the formation of lesions in mice, and that inhibiting binding could reduce lesion growth. In mouse models of atherosclerosis, we found that SAMD1 binds LDL; that SAMD1/apoB complex is ingested by intimal cells; and that recognizable epitopes of the SAMD1/apoB complex survive some degree of catabolism in foam cell. These data appear to support the SAMD1/LDL retention hypothesis of lesion growth. Despite apparently irreversible binding of human LDL to full-length human SAMD1, efficient anti-SAMD1-antibody inhibitors were created. In vivo lesion targeting of inhibitors was demonstrated by MRI, ultrasound, and ex vivo microscopy. However, only non-statistically significant reductions in spontaneous lesion size in apoE-/- mice were seen after 12 weeks of treatment with PEG-fab inhibitors of SAMD1/LDL binding. In contrast, these inhibitors substantially reduced LDL retention in carotid injury lesions in apoE-/- and LDLR-/- mice 7 days after injury. The most obvious difference between injury lesions and early spontaneous lesions is the presence of numerous smooth muscle cells and associated extracellular matrix in the injury lesions. Thus, SAMD1 may be involved in retention of apoB-Lps in mouse lesions, but not until smooth muscle cells have entered the intima. In addition, SAMD1 is seen throughout arteries in changing patterns that suggest broader and more complicated roles in atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "How and to what degree gene duplication events create regulatory innovation, redundancy, or neofunctionalization remain important questions in animal evolution and comparative genetics. Ankfn1 genes are single copy in most invertebrates, partially duplicated in jawed vertebrates, and only the derived copy retained in most mammals. Null mutations in the single mouse homolog have vestibular and neurological abnormalities. Null mutation of the single Drosophila homolog is typically lethal with severe sensorimotor deficits in rare survivors. The functions and potential redundancy of paralogs in species with two copies is not known. Here we define a vestibular role for Ankfn1 homologs in zebrafish based on simultaneous disruption of each locus. Zebrafish with both paralogs disrupted showed vestibular defects and early lethality from swim bladder inflation failure. One intact copy at either locus was sufficient to prevent major phenotypes. Our results show that vertebrate Ankfn1 genes are required for vestibular-related functions, with at least partial redundancy between ancestral and derived paralogs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAn optimal starting point for relating genome function to organismal biology is a high-quality nuclear genome assembly, and long-read sequencing is revolutionizing the production of this genomic resource in insects. Despite this, nuclear genome assemblies have been under-represented for agricultural insect pests, particularly from the order Coleoptera. Here we present a de novo genome assembly and structural annotation for the coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), based on Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read data generated from a wild-caught female, as well as the assembly process that also led to the recovery of the complete circular genome assemblies of the beetles mitochondrial genome and that of the biocontrol agent, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV). As an invasive pest of palm trees, O. rhinoceros is undergoing an expansion in its range across the Pacific Islands, requiring new approaches to management that may include strategies facilitated by genome assembly and annotation.\n\nResultsHigh-quality DNA isolated from an adult female was used to create four ONT libraries that were sequenced using four MinION flow cells, producing a total of 27.2 Gb of high-quality long-read sequences. We employed an iterative assembly process and polishing with one lane of high-accuracy Illumina reads, obtaining a final size of the assembly of 377.36 Mb that had high contiguity (fragment N50 length = 12 Mb) and accuracy, as evidenced by the exceptionally high completeness of the benchmarked set of conserved single-copy orthologous genes (BUSCO completeness = 99.11%). These quality metrics place our assembly as the most complete of the published Coleopteran genomes. The structural annotation of the nuclear genome assembly contained a highly-accurate set of 16,371 protein-coding genes showing BUSCO completeness of 92.09%, as well as the expected number of non-coding RNAs and the number and structure of paralogous genes in a gene family like Sigma GST.\n\nConclusionsThe genomic resources produced in this study form a foundation for further functional genetic research and management programs that may inform the control and surveillance of O. rhinoceros populations, and we demonstrate the efficacy of de novo genome assembly using long-read ONT data from a single field-caught insect.",

    "abstract": "Membrane lipids, and especially phosphoinositides, are differentially enriched within the eukaryotic endomembrane system. This generates a landmark code by modulating the properties of each membrane. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] specifically accumulates at the plasma membrane in yeast, animal and plant cells, where it regulates a wide range of cellular processes including endocytic trafficking. However, the functional consequences of mispatterning PI(4,5)P2 in plants are unknown. Here, we functionally characterized the putative phosphoinositide phosphatase SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIN9 (SAC9) in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). We found that SAC9 depletion led to the ectopic localization of PI(4,5)P2 on cortical intracellular compartments, which depends on PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 production at the plasma membrane. SAC9 localizes to a subpopulation of trans-Golgi Network/early endosomes that are enriched in a region close to the cell cortex and that are coated with clathrin. Furthermore, it interacts and colocalizes with Src Homology 3 Domain Protein 2 (SH3P2), a protein involved in endocytic trafficking. In the absence of SAC9, SH3P2 localization is altered and the clathrin-mediated endocytosis rate is reduced. Together, our results highlight the importance of restricting PI(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane and illustrate that one of the consequence of PI(4,5)P2 misspatterning in plants is to impact the endocytic trafficking.\n\nOne-sentence summarySAC9 prevents the accumulation of PI(4,5)P2 in intracellular compartments, thereby contributing to clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane and regulating the cortical localization of its protein partner SH3P2.",

    "abstract": "The nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) containing protein 3 with a pyrin domain (NLRP3) is emerging to be a critical intracellular inflammasome sensor of membrane integrity and a highly important clinical target against chronic inflammation. Here we report that the endogenous, stimulus-responsive form of full-length NLRP3 is a 12-16 mer double ring cage held together by LRR-LRR interactions with the pyrin domains shielded within the assembly to avoid premature activation. Surprisingly, this NLRP3 form is predominantly membrane localized, which is consistent with previously noted localization of NLRP3 at various membrane organelles. Structure-guided mutagenesis reveals that trans-Golgi network dispersion into vesicles, an early event observed for all NLRP3 activating stimuli, requires the double ring cages of NLRP3. Double ring-defective NLRP3 mutants further abolish inflammasome punctum formation, caspase-1 processing and cell death. Thus, unlike other inflammasome sensors that are monomeric when inactive, our data uncover a unique NLRP3 oligomer on membrane that is poised to sense diverse signals to induce inflammasome activation.",

    "abstract": "TMEM184B is a putative seven-pass membrane protein that promotes axon degeneration after injury. TMEM184B mutation causes aberrant neuromuscular architecture and sensory and motor behavioral defects in mice. The mechanism through which TMEM184B causes neuromuscular defects is unknown. We employed Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the function of the TMEM184B ortholog, Tmep (CG12004) at the neuromuscular junction. We show that Tmep is required for full adult viability and efficient larval locomotion. Tmep mutant larvae have a reduced body contraction rate compared to controls, with stronger deficits in females. Surviving adult Tmep mutant females show \"bang sensitivity,\" a phenotype associated with epileptic seizures. In recordings from body wall muscles, Tmep mutants show substantial hyperexcitability, with many post-synaptic potentials fired in response to a single stimulation, consistent with a role for Tmep in restraining synaptic excitability. Neuromuscular junctions in Tmep mutants show modest structural defects and satellite boutons, which could also contribute to poor locomotor performance. Tmep is expressed in endosomes and synaptic vesicles within motor neurons, suggesting a possible role in synaptic membrane trafficking. Using RNAi knockdown, we show that Tmep is required in motor neurons for proper larval locomotion and excitability. Locomotor defects can be rescued by presynaptic knock-down of endoplasmic reticulum calcium channels or by reducing evoked release probability, suggesting that excess synaptic activity drives behavioral deficiencies. Our work establishes a critical function for the TMEM184B ortholog Tmep in the regulation of synaptic transmission and locomotor behavior.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the role of the post-encoding period for consolidation of self-centered (egocentric) and world-centered (allocentric) spatial memory in neurologically normal human subjects. We used the GABAA-ergic anesthetic propofol to transiently modulate neural activity during the early stage of spatial memory consolidation. A total of 52 patients undergoing minor surgery learned to navigate to a target in a five-armed maze derived from animal experiments immediately prior to injection of propofol (early group) or more than 60 minutes before injection (late group). Two hundred and forty minutes after anesthesia, subjects were tested for memory-guided navigation. Our results show a selective impairment of memory-guided navigation in the early group and near-normal performance in the late group. Both egocentric and allocentric navigation were affected, albeit with distinct error patterns. In the egocentric condition, early group patients navigated significantly more often to a wrong alley of the maze but showed normal navigation times, thus suggesting a deficit mainly for memory of sequences of path segments. By contrast, in the allocentric condition, early group patients mostly navigated to the correct alley of the maze but showed a significant increase in detours and prolonged navigation times, thus suggesting a weakened representation of the relationship between landmarks. We conclude that presumably hippocampus-dependent networks contribute to early consolidation of representations underlying both egocentric and allocentric memory-guided navigation. Distinct aspects of these representations are susceptible to GABAA-ergic modulation within a post-encoding time-window of less than 60 minutes, indicating a redistribution and reconfiguration of spatial memory networks early during consolidation.\n\nSignificance statementO_LIPropofol modulates consolidation of spatial representations underlying human spatial navigation.\nC_LIO_LIFollowing administration of propofol, memory-guided navigation using self-centered (egocentric) and world-centered (allocentric) spatial information is impaired.\nC_LIO_LIError patterns after administration of propofol suggest modulation of a post-encoding integration process relevant for ego- and allocentric memory representations.\nC_LIO_LIThe transient susceptibility of this process to GABAA-ergic modulation is consistent with rapid reconfiguration of networks for spatial memory shortly after learning.\nC_LIO_LIPropofol provides a pharmacological tool to investigate spatial memory consolidation in humans.\nC_LI",

In C. elegans, PVQ axons that lack mitochondria degenerate spontaneously with age. Using an unbiased genetic screen, we found that cell-specific activation of CaMKII/UNC-43 suppresses axon degeneration due to loss of mitochondria. Unexpectedly, CaMKII/UNC-43 protects against degeneration through the conserved Sarm1/TIR-1-ASK1/NSY-1 MAPK pathway. In addition, we show that disrupting a trafficking complex composed of calsyntenin/CASY-1, Mint/LIN-10, and kinesin suppresses axon degeneration. Further analysis indicates that disruption of this trafficking complex activates the CaMKII-Sarm1-MAPK pathway through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Our findings identify CaMKII as a pivot point between mitochondrial defects and axon degeneration, describe how it is regulated in this context, and uncover a surprising neuroprotective role for the Sarm1-ASK1 pathway.",
