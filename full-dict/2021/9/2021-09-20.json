    "abstract": "Although it is well established that motivational factors such as earning more money for performing well improve motor performance, how the motor system implements this improvement remains unclear. For instance, feedback-based control, which uses sensory feedback from the body to correct for errors in movement, improves with greater reward. But feedback control encompasses many feedback loops with diverse characteristics such as the brain regions involved and their response time. Which specific loops drive these performance improvements with reward is unknown, even though their diversity makes it unlikely that they are contributing uniformly. We systematically tested the effect of reward on the latency (how long for a corrective response to arise?) and gain (how large is the corrective response?) of seven distinct sensorimotor feedback loops in humans. Only the fastest feedback loops were insensitive to reward, and the earliest reward-driven changes were consistently an increase in feedback gains, not a reduction in latency. Rather, a reduction of response latencies only tended to occur in slower feedback loops. These observations were similar across sensory modalities (vision and proprioception). Our results may have implications regarding feedback control performance in athletic coaching. For instance, coaching methodologies that rely on reinforcement or \"reward shaping\" may need to specifically target aspects of movement that rely on reward-sensitive feedback responses.",

    "abstract": "Neural, physiological and behavioral signals synchronize between human subjects in a variety of settings. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain this interpersonal synchrony, but there is no clarity under which conditions it arises, for which signals, or whether there is a common underlying mechanism. We hypothesized that similar cognitive processing of a shared stimulus is the source of synchrony between subjects, measured here as inter-subject correlation. To test this we presented informative videos to participants in an attentive and distracted condition and subsequently measured information recall. Inter-subject correlation was observed for electro-encephalography, gaze position, pupil size and heart rate, but not respiration and head movements. The strength of correlation was co-modulated in the different signals, changed with attentional state, and predicted subsequent recall of information presented in the videos. There was robust within-subject coupling between brain, heart and eyes, but not respiration or head movements. The results suggest that inter-subject correlation is the result of similar cognitive processing and thus emerges only for those signals that exhibit a robust brain-body connection. While physiological and behavioral fluctuations may be driven by multiple features of the stimulus, correlation with other individuals is co-modulated by the level of attentional engagement with the stimulus.",

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common single gene cause of intellectual disability and Autism Spectrum Disorder. Cognitive inflexibility is one of the hallmarks of FXS with affected individuals showing extreme difficulty adapting to novel or complex situations. To explore the neural correlates of this cognitive inflexibility, we used a rat model of FXS (Fmr1-/y), and recorded from the CA1 region of the hippocampus while animals habituated in a novel environment for two consecutive days. On the first day of exploration, the firing rate and spatial tuning of CA1 pyramidal neurons was similar between wild-type (WT) and Fmr1-/y rats. However, while CA1 pyramidal neurons from WT rats showed experience-dependent changes in firing and spatial tuning between the first and second day of exposure to the environment, these changes were decreased or absent in CA1 neurons of Fmr1-/y rats. These findings were consistent with increased excitability of Fmr1-/y CA1 neurons in ex-vivo hippocampal slices, which correlated with reduced synaptic inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex. Lastly, activity patterns of CA1 pyramidal neurons were discoordinated with respect to hippocampal oscillatory activity in Fmr1-/y rats. These findings suggest a network-level origin of cognitive deficits in FXS.",

    "abstract": "Tissue damage elicits a rapid innate immune response that is essential for efficient wound healing and survival of metazoans. It is well known that p38 MAPK kinase, TGF-{beta}, and hemidesmosome signaling pathways have been involved in wounding-induced innate immunity in C. elegans. Here, we find that loss of function of ATFS-1 increased innate immune response while an elevated level of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mitoUPR) inhibits the innate immune response upon epidermal wounding. Epidermal wounding triggers the nucleus export of ATFS-1 and inhibits themitoUPR in C. elegans epidermis. Moreover, genetic analysis suggests that ATFS-1 functions upstream of the p38 MAP kinase, TGF-{beta} and DAF-16 signaling pathways in regulating AMPs induction. Thus, our results suggest that the mitoUPR function as an intracellular signal required to fine-tune innate immune response after tissue damage.\n\nHighlights-- ATFS-1 inhibits the wounding-induced innate immune response in C. elegans\n-- mitoUPR inhibits wounding-induced innate immune response\n-- Epidermal wounding induces downregulation of ATFS-1 in the epidermis\n-- mitoUPR acts upstream of p38MAPK and TGF-{beta} pathways to regulate innate immunity",

    "abstract": "The Plasminogen-Apple-Nematode (PAN) domain, with a core of four to six cysteine residues, is found in > 28,000 proteins across 959 genera but its role in protein function is not fully understood. The PAN domain was initially characterized to be present in numerous proteins including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Dysregulation of HGF-mediated signaling results in numerous deadly cancers. All biological impacts of HGF in cell proliferation are triggered by binding of HGF to its cell surface receptor, cellular mesenchymal-epidermal transition (c-MET). Here, we show that four PAN domain cysteine residues are essential for HGF/c-MET signaling. Mutating these residues resulted in retardation of perinuclear localization, cellular internalization of HGF and its receptor, c-MET, and c-MET ubiquitination. Our observations indicate that the PAN domain of HGF is required for the c-MET binding and subsequent c-MET autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of its downstream targets, protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, transcriptional activation of HGF/c-MET signaling-related genes including matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), ETS translocation variant 1, 4, and 5 (ETV1, ETV4, ETV5), and early growth response 1 (EGR1) was impaired and cell proliferation was attenuated. These results suggest that core cysteine residues in the PAN domain are critical for HGF/c-MET interaction, c-MET mediated signal transduction, and cell survival. Thus, targeting the PAN domain of HGF may represent a mechanism for selectively regulating the binding and activation of the c-MET pathway.\n\nSignificanceHGF/c-MET signaling induces multifunctional cellular responses. Dysregulation of HGF/c-MET signaling cascade can lead to tumorigenesis by transforming normal cells to tumor cells. This work defines the importance of core cysteine residues in the PAN domain of HGF in downstream activation of HGF/c-MET signaling. To understand the role of cysteines in the PAN domain, PAN mutants of HGF were used to stimulate c-MET signaling in cells and the impact was delineated by determining phosphorylation and transcription of downstream targets. Mutations in core cysteines in the HGF-PAN domain completely blocked downstream phosphorylation and perinuclear accumulation of c-MET. These results suggest an indispensable role for the cysteine-rich PAN domain in HGF/c-MET interaction and could set the stage for future therapies that selectively disrupt the MET signaling cascade with limited off-target effects in tumors overexpressing HGF/c-MET.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) elasticity is perceived by cells via focal adhesion structures, which transduce mechanical cues into chemical signalling to conform cell behaviour. Although the contribution of ECM compliance to the control of cell migration or division has been extensively studied, little has been reported regarding infectious processes. We have studied how mechanical properties of the ECM impact invasion of cells by the extraintestinal Escherichia coli pathogen UTI89. We show that UTI89 takes advantage, via its CNF1 toxin, of integrin mechanoactivation to trigger its invasion into cells. We identified OPTN as a protein regulated by ECM stiffness whose function is required for bacterial invasion and integrin mechanical coupling and for stimulation of HACE1 E3 ligase activity towards the Rac1 GTPase. We showed that OPTN knockdown cells display enhanced Rac1 activation, strong mechanochemical adhesion signalling and increased cyclin D1 translation, together with enhanced cell proliferation independent of ECM stiffness. Despite such features, OPTN knockdown cells displayed defective traction force buildup associated with limited cellular invasion by UTI89. Together, our data indicate that OPTN, through a new role in mechanobiology, supports CNF1-producing uropathogenic E. coli invasion and links HACE1-mediated ubiquitylation of Rac1 to ECM mechanical properties and integrin mechanotransduction.",

    "abstract": "PERK is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane sensor that phosphorylates eIF2 to initiate the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). eIF2 phosphorylation promotes stress-responsive gene expression most notably through the transcription factor ATF4 that contains a regulatory 5 leader. Possible PERK effectors other than ATF4 remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the bZIP transcription factor Xrp1 is required for ATF4-independent PERK signaling. Cell type-specific gene expression profiling in Drosophila indicated that delta-family glutathione-S-transferases (gstD) are prominently induced by the UPR-activating transgene Rh1G69D. Perk was necessary and sufficient for such gstD induction, but ATF4 was not required. Instead, Perk and other regulators of eIF2 phosphorylation regulated Xrp1 protein levels to induce gstDs. The Xrp1 5 leader has a conserved upstream Open Reading Frame (uORF) analogous to those that regulate ATF4 translation. The gstD-GFP reporter induction required putative Xrp1 binding sites. These results indicate that antioxidant genes are highly induced by a previously unrecognized UPR signaling axis consisting of PERK and Xrp1.",

    "abstract": "While screening our in-house 1,072 marketed drugs for their ability to extend the lifespan using Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as an animal model, crotamiton (N-ethyl-o-crotonotoluidide) showed anti-aging activity and was selected for further structural optimization. After replacing the ortho-methyl of crotamiton with ortho-fluoro, crotamiton derivative JM03 was obtained and showed better activity in terms of lifespan-extension and stress resistance than crotamiton. It was further explored that JM03 extended the lifespan of C. elegans through osmotic avoidance abnormal-9 (OSM-9). Besides, JM03 improves the ability of nematode to resist oxidative stress and hypertonic stress through OSM-9, but not osm-9/capsaicin receptor related-2 (OCR-2). Then the inhibition of OSM-9 by JM03 reduces the aggregation of Q35 in C. elegans via upregulating the genes associated with proteostasis. SKN-1 signaling was also found to be activated after JM03 treatment, which might contribute to proteostasis, stress resistance and lifespan extension. In summary, this study explored a new small molecule derived from crotamiton, which has efficient anti-oxidative, anti-hypertonic and anti-aging effects, and could further lead to promising application prospects.",

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is more prone to metastasis and recurrence than other breast cancer subtypes. This study aimed to identify genes that can act as diagnostic biomarkers for predicting lymph node metastasis in TNBC patients. The transcriptomic data of TNBC with or without lymph node metastasis was acquired from TCGA, and the differentially expressed genes were identified. Further, logistic-regression method has been used to identify the top 15 genes (or 15 gene signatures) based on their ability to predict metastasis (AUC>0.65). These 15 gene signatures were used to develop machine learning techniques based prediction models; Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier outperformed other with AUC>0.80 on both training and validation datasets. The best model failed drastically on nine independent microarray datasets obtained from GEO. We investigated the reason for the failure of our best model, and it was observed that the certain genes in 15 gene signatures were showing opposite regulating trends, i.e., genes are upregulated in TCGA-TNBC patients while it is downregulated on other microarray datasets or vice-versa. In conclusion, the 15 gene signatures may act as diagnostic markers for the detection of lymph node metastatic status in TCGA dataset, but quite challenging across multiple platforms. We also identified the prognostic potential of the 15 selected genes and found that overexpression of ZNRF2, FRZB, and TCEAL4 was associated with poor survival with HR>2.3 and p-value[&le;]0.05.

    "abstract": "Immunological memory is key to productive adaptive immunity. An unbiased, high throughput gene expression profiling of tissue-resident memory T cells at their precise anatomical locations within the lung is fundamental to understanding lung immunity, but such spatial information has yet to be characterized. In this study, using a well-established Klebsiella pneumoniae infection model, we performed an integrative analysis of spatial transcriptome with single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq on lung cells from mice after immunization using the 10x Genomics Chromium and Visium platform. We employed several deconvolution algorithms and established an optimized deconvolution pipeline to accurately decipher specific cell-type composition by anatomic location. We identified and located 12 major cell types by scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic analysis. Integrating scATAC-seq data from the same cells processed in parallel with scRNA-seq, we found epigenomic profiles provide more robust cell type identification, especially for lineage-specific T helper cells. When combining all three data modalities, we observed a dynamic change in the location of T helper cells as well as their corresponding chemokines for chemotaxis. Furthermore, cell-cell communication analysis of spatial transcriptome provided evidence of lineage-specific T helper cells receiving designated cytokine signaling. In summary, our first-in-class study demonstrated the power of multi-omics analysis to uncover intrinsic spatial- and cell-type-dependent molecular mechanisms of lung immunity. Our data provides a rich research resource of single cell multi-omics data as a reference for understanding spatial dynamics of lung immunization.",

However, its role in oxidative stress tolerance is not well understood. Here, we characterized the role of FSD1 in response to methyl viologen (MV)-induced oxidative stress in Arabidopsis thaliana. The findings demonstrated that the antioxidative function of FSD1 depends on the availability of Cu2+ in growth media. Prolonged MV exposure led to a decreased accumulation rate of superoxide, higher levels of hydrogen peroxide production, and higher protein carbonylation in the fsd1 mutants and transgenic plants lacking a plastidial pool of FSD1, compared to the wild type. MV led to a rapid increase in FSD1 activity, followed by a decrease. Chloroplastic localization of FSD1 is necessary for these changes. Proteomic analysis showed that the sensitivity of the fsd1 mutants coincided with decreased abundance of ferredoxin and light PSII harvesting complex proteins, with altered levels of signaling proteins. Collectively, the study provides evidence for the conditional antioxidative function of FSD1 and its possible role in signaling.",

    "abstract": "In plants, small RNA (sRNA) can regulate gene expression via post transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) or through RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) leading to transcriptional gene silencing (TGS). sRNA is mobile throughout the plant, with movement occurring short distances from cell-to-cell as well as long distances through the vasculature via phloem trafficking. The range of long-distance sRNA mediated signaling from the vasculature to the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is not clear. To investigate this, two independent transgenic approaches were used to examine trafficking of phloem-expressed sRNA to the SAM in Arabidopsis thaliana. First, the phloem companion-cell specific promoter SUC2 was used to drive expression of an inverted repeat complementary to FLOWERING LOCUS D (FD), a flowering time regulator expressed exclusively in the SAM. In a separate experiment, the SUC2 promoter was used to express an artificial microRNA (aMiR) designed to target a synthetic CLAVATA3 (CLV3) target in the SAM stem cells. Both systems provide evidence of a phloem-to-SAM sRNA communication axis connecting distal regions of the plant to the stem cells of the SAM, which ultimately gives rise to all shoot tissues, including gametes. Thus, phloem-to-SAM sRNA movement defines an important link between sRNA expressed in distal regions of the plant and the growing shoot. Importantly, phloem-to-SAM sRNA trafficking may allow somatic sRNA to direct SAM RdDM, fixing transient sRNA expression events into stable epigenetic changes.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWFree gaze and moving images are typically avoided in EEG experiments due to the expected generation of artifacts and noise. Yet for a growing number of research questions, loosening these rigorous restrictions would be beneficial. Among these is research on visual aesthetic experiences, which often involve open-ended exploration of highly variable stimuli. Here we systematically compare the effect of conservative vs. more liberal experimental settings on various measures of behavior, brain activity and physiology in an aesthetic rating task. Our primary aim was to assess EEG signal quality. 43 participants either maintained fixation or were allowed to gaze freely, and viewed either static images or dynamic (video) stimuli consisting of dance performances or nature scenes. A passive auditory background task (auditory steady-state response; ASSR) was added as a proxy measure for overall EEG recording quality. We recorded EEG, ECG and eyetracking data, and participants rated their aesthetic preference and state of boredom on each trial. Whereas both behavioral ratings and gaze behavior were affected by task and stimulus manipulations, EEG SNR was barely affected and generally robust across all conditions, despite only minimal preprocessing and no trial rejection. In particular, we show that using video stimuli does not necessarily result in lower EEG quality and can, on the contrary, significantly reduce eye movements while increasing both the participants aesthetic response and general task engagement. We see these as encouraging results indicating that - at least in the lab - more liberal experimental conditions can be adopted without significant loss of signal quality.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe assess trade-offs between EEG quality and behavior for common task constraints\nC_LIO_LIInvestigated constraints: fixation task vs. free gaze, and video vs. static stimuli\nC_LIO_LIMeasures: EEG quality, aesthetic preference, task engagement, gaze and heart rate\nC_LIO_LIVideo stimuli reduce eye movements, increase engagement and do not affect EEG SNR\nC_LIO_LIFixation task only slightly increases SNR and does not influence ratings\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Confidence is typically defined as a subjective judgment about whether a decision is right. Decisions are based on sources of information that come from various cognitive domains and are processed in different brain systems. An unsettled question is whether the brain computes confidence in a similar manner whatever the domain or in a manner that would be idiosyncratic to each domain. To address this issue, human participants of both sexes performed two tasks probing confidence in decisions made about the same material (history and geography statements), but based on different cognitive processes: semantic memory for deciding whether the statement was true or false, and duration perception for deciding whether the statement display was long or short. At the behavioral level, we found that the same factors (difficulty, accuracy, response time and confidence in the preceding decision) predicted confidence judgments in both tasks. At the neural level, we observed using fMRI that confidence judgments in both tasks were associated to activity in the same brain regions: positively in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and negatively in a prefronto-parietal network. Together, these findings suggest the existence of a shared brain system that generates confidence judgments in a similar manner across cognitive domains.",

The direct imaging of the myelin bilayer, which has ultra-short transverse relaxation time (uT2), was acquired to test the performance of the proposed UTE sequence.\n\nTheory and MethodsThe rosette trajectory was developed based on rotations of a  petal-like pattern in the kx-ky plane, with oscillated extensions in kz-direction for 3D coverage. Five healthy volunteers were recruited and underwent ten dual-echo 3D rosette UTE scans with various echo times (TEs). Dual-exponential complex model fitting was performed on the magnitude data to separate uT2 signals, with the output of uT2 fraction, uT2 value, and long T2 value.\n\nResultsThe reconstructed images signal contrast between whiate matter (WM) and grey matter (GM) increased with longer TEs. The WM regions had higher uT2 fraction values than GM (10.9%{+/-}1.9% vs. 5.7%{+/-}2.4%). The uT2 value was approximately 0.15 milliseconds in WM.\n\nConclusionThe higher uT2 fraction value in WM compared to GM demonstrated the ability of the proposed sequence to capture rapidly decaying signals.",

    "abstract": "SummaryIn humans, cognitive and motor functions develop in association with maturation, followed by a decline in advancing age. In this study, we aimed to provide a method for extending healthy lifespan by preventing age-related phenomena. Therefore, we focused on RP58, a transcriptional repressor, whose expression is reduced during aging in the human cortex. In the Rp58 hetero-knockout (KO) mice, object location memory was impaired even at 4-5 months, while it was normal in the wild-type mice at 4-5 months but was impaired at 12-18 months. These results indicate an early onset of impaired spatial memory in the mutant mice. As the underlying mechanism, the Rp58 hetero-KO mice showed early onset of DNA damage accumulation and microglial activation in the dentate gyrus due to a DNA repair defect that is generally observed with aging. As another hallmark of aging, we focused on mitochondrial function and detected mitochondrial abnormalities in the Rp58 hetero-KO mice at 4-5 months. Notably, continuous treatments with minocycline, a neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory antibiotic, prevented the facilitation of age-related phenomena in the Rp58 hetero-KO mice. These results suggest the availability of the Rp58 hetero-KO mice as a novel mouse model of human-like early aging and provide a therapeutic strategy to prevent age-related phenomena using minocycline.\n\nHighlightO_LIRp58 hetero-KO mice exhibit early aging phenotypes including impairment of spatial cognition\nC_LIO_LIRp58 hetero-KO mice show early accumulation of DNA damage due to a defect in the DNA repair system\nC_LIO_LITreatment with minocycline prevented cognitive dysfunction observed in Rp58 hetero-KO mice\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Trial history biases in decision-making tasks are thought to reflect systematic updates of decision variables, therefore their precise nature informs conclusions about underlying heuristic strategies and learning processes. However, random drifts in decision variables can corrupt this inference by mimicking the signatures of systematic updates. Hence, identifying the trial-by-trial evolution of decision variables requires methods that can robustly account for such drifts. Recent studies (Lak20, Mendonca 20) have made important advances in this direction, by proposing a convenient method to correct for the influence of slow drifts in decision criterion, a key decision variable. Here we apply this correction to a variety of updating scenarios, and evaluate its performance. We show that the correction fails for a wide range of commonly assumed systematic updating strategies, distorting ones inference away from the veridical strategies towards a narrow subset. To address these limitations, we propose a model-based approach for disambiguating systematic updates from random drifts, and demonstrate its success on real and synthetic datasets. We show that this approach accurately recovers the latent trajectory of drifts in decision criterion as well as the generative systematic updates from simulated data. Our results offer recommendations for methods to account for the interactions between history biases and slow drifts, and highlight the advantages of incorporating assumptions about the generative process directly into models of decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Memories are stored in the brain as cellular ensembles activated during learning and reactivated during retrieval. Using the Tet-tag system in mice, we label dorsal dentate gyrus neurons activated by positive, neutral or negative experiences with channelrhodopsin-2. Following fear-conditioning, these cells are artificially reactivated during fear memory recall. Optical stimulation of a competing positive memory is sufficient to update the memory during reconsolidation, thereby reducing conditioned fear acutely and enduringly. Moreover, mice demonstrate operant responding for reactivation of a positive memory, confirming its rewarding properties. These results show that interference from a rewarding experience can counteract negative affective states. While memory-updating, induced by memory reactivation, involves a relatively small set of neurons, we also find that activating a large population of randomly labeled dorsal dentate gyrus neurons is effective in promoting reconsolidation. Importantly, memory-updating is specific to the fear memory. These findings implicate the dorsal dentate gyrus as a potential therapeutic node for modulating memories to suppress fear.",

    "abstract": "Mapping the entire frequency bandwidth of neuronal oscillations in the brain is of paramount importance for understanding physiological and pathological states. The ability to record simultaneously infraslow activity (<0.1 Hz) and higher frequencies (0.1-600 Hz) using the same recording electrode would particularly benefit epilepsy research. However, commonly used metal microelectrode technology is not well suited for recording infraslow activity. Here we use flexible graphene depth neural probes (gDNP), consisting of a linear array of graphene microtransistors, to concurrently record infraslow and high frequency neuronal activity in awake rodents. We show that gDNPs can reliably record and map with high spatial resolution seizures, post-ictal spreading depolarisation, and high frequency epileptic activity through cortical laminae to the CA1 layer of the hippocampus in a mouse model of chemically-induced seizures. We demonstrate functionality of chronically implanted devices over 10 weeks by recording with high fidelity spontaneous spike-wave discharges and associated infraslow activity in a rat model of absence epilepsy. Altogether, our work highlights the suitability of this technology for in vivo electrophysiology research, in particular, to examine the contributions of infraslow activity to seizure initiation and termination.",

However, the neuronal mechanisms of hippocampal regulation of locomotion and exploratory behavior remain unclear. Here we found that the inhibitory hippocampo-septal projection bi-directionally controls locomotion speed of mice. Pharmacogenetic activation of these septum-projecting interneurons decreased locomotion and exploratory behavior. Similarly, activation of the hippocampus-originated inhibitory terminal in the medial septum reduced locomotion. On the other hand, inhibition of the hippocampus-originated inhibitory terminal increased locomotion. The locomotion-regulative roles were specific to the septal projecting interneurons as activation of hippocampal interneurons projecting to the retrosplenial cortex did not change animal locomotion. Therefore, this study reveals a specific long-range inhibitory output from the hippocampus in the regulation of animal locomotion.",

    "abstract": "Pesticide resistance poses a critical threat to agriculture, human health and biodiversity. Mixtures of fungicides are recommended and widely used in resistance management strategies. However, the components of the efficiency of such mixtures remain unclear. We performed an experimental evolution study on the fungal pathogen Z. tritici, to determine how mixtures managed resistance. We compared the effect of the continuous use of single active ingredients to that of mixtures, at the minimal dose providing full control of the disease, which we refer to as the \"efficient\" dose. We found that the performance of efficient-dose mixtures against an initially susceptible population depended strongly on the components of the mixture. Such mixtures were either as durable as the best mixture component used alone, or worse than all components used alone. Moreover, efficient-dose mixture regimes probably select for generalist resistance profiles as a result of the combination of selection pressures exerted by the various components and their lower doses. Our results indicate that mixtures should not be considered a universal strategy. Experimental evaluations of specificities for the pathogens targeted, their interactions with fungicides and the interactions between fungicides are crucial for the design of sustainable resistance management strategies.",

The toolkit features many independent core workflows for both whole genomic and transcriptomic data analysis. Even though all the necessary, well-established tools are integrated into the pipeline to enable  out-of-the-box analysis, we provide the user with the means to replace modules or alter the pipeline as needed. Notably, we have integrated algorithms developed in-house for predicting driver and passenger mutations based on mutational context and tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes from somatic mutation data. We benchmarked our tool against Genome In A Bottle (GIAB) benchmark dataset (NA12878) and got the highest F1 score of 0.971 and 0.988 for indels and SNPs, respectively, using the BWA MEM - GATK HC DNA-Seq pipeline. Similarly, we achieved a correlation coefficient of r=0.85 using the HISAT2-StringTie-ballgown and STAR-StringTie-ballgown RNA-Seq pipelines on the human monocyte dataset (SRP082682). Overall, our tool enables easy analyses of omics datasets, with minimal steps, significantly ameliorating complex data analysis pipelines.\n\nAvailability: https://github.com/RamanLab/iCOMIC",

    "abstract": "GPR85 is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor and is a super-conserved receptor expressed in the brain sub-family (SREB) with GPR27 and GPR173. These three receptors are \"orphan receptors\"; however, their endogenous ligands have not been identified. SREB has garnered the interest of many scientists because it is expressed in the central nervous system and is evolutionarily conserved. In particular, brain mass is reported to be increased and learning and memory are improved in GPR85 knockout mice (Matsumoto et al., 2008). In this study, we characterized newly synthesized compounds using a GPR85-Gs fusion protein and the [35S]GTP{gamma}S binding assay and identified novel GPR85 inverse-agonists with IC50 values of approximately 1 {micro}M. To analyze the neurochemical character of the compounds and investigate the physiological significance of GPR85, we used cerebellar Purkinje cells expressing GPR85 and an electrophysiological technique. Based on the results, the inverse-agonist compound for GPR85 modulated potassium channel opening. Together with the results of previous gene analysis of GPR85, we expect that the development of the GPR85 ligand will provide new insights into a few types of neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate age-related differences in fatigability induced by an isometric quadriceps intermittent fatiguing test in young (<35 years old), old (>60 years old) and very old (>80 years old) men and women. Maximal force loss, contractile function and voluntary activation of the knee extensors were evaluated throughout an isometric fatiguing test using femoral nerve magnetic stimulations. Older adults performed more contractions (index of relative performance) than young (P = 0.046) and very old adults (P = 0.007), without differences between young and very old adults. Total work (absolute performance) was greater for young and old adults compared to very old adults (P < 0.001), without differences between young and old adults. At exhaustion, force loss was greater for young (-28 {+/-} 9%) compared to old adults (-19 {+/-} 8%), but not very old adults (-23 {+/-} 8%). The response to femoral nerve stimulation decreased similarly at exhaustion for the three age groups, indicating similar alteration in contractile function with age. No impairment in voluntary activation was observed. Impairments in neuromuscular parameters were similar for men and women. This study showed that older adults were less fatigable than young adults during an isometric intermittent fatiguing task of the knee extensors. This greater fatigue resistance was not maintained in very old adults independent of sex. Fatigability at exhaustion was likely due to impairments in contractile function for the three age groups.",

    "abstract": "Despite increased understanding about psoriasis pathophysiology, currently there is a lack of predictive computational models. We developed a personalisable ordinary differential equations model of human epidermis and psoriasis that incorporates immune cells and cytokine stimuli to regulate the transition between two stable steady states of clinically healthy (non-lesional) and disease (lesional psoriasis, plaque) skin. In line with experimental data, an immune stimulus initiated transition from healthy skin to psoriasis and apoptosis of immune and epidermal cells induced by UVB phototherapy returned the epidermis back to the healthy state. Notably, our model was able to distinguish disease flares. The flexibility of our model permitted the development of a patient-specific \"UVB sensitivity\" parameter that reflected subject-specific sensitivity to apoptosis and enabled simulation of individual patients clinical response trajectory. In a prospective clinical study of 94 patients, serial individual UVB doses and clinical response (Psoriasis Area Severity Index) values collected over the first three weeks of UVB therapy informed estimation of the \"UVB sensitivity\" parameter and the prediction of individual patient outcome at the end of phototherapy. An important advance of our model is its potential for direct clinical application through early assessment of response to UVB therapy, and for individualised optimisation of phototherapy regimes to improve clinical outcome. Additionally by incorporating the complex interaction of immune cells and epidermal keratinocytes, our model provides a basis to study and predict outcomes to biologic therapies in psoriasis.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe present a new computer model for psoriasis, an immune-mediated disabling skin disease which presents with red, raised scaly plaques that can appear over the whole body. Psoriasis affects millions of people in the UK alone and causes significant impairment to quality of life, and currently has no cure. Only a few treatments (including UVB phototherapy) can induce temporary remission. Despite our increased understanding about psoriasis, treatments are still given on a  trial and error basis and there are no reliable computer models that can a) elucidate the mechanisms behind psoriasis onset or flare and b) predict a patients response to a course of treatment (e.g., phototherapy) and the likelihood of inducing a period of remission. Our computer model addresses both these needs. First, it explicitly describes the interaction between the immune system and skin cells. Second, our model captures response to therapy at the individual patient level and enables personalised prediction of clinical outcomes. Notably, our model also supports prediction of amending individual UVB phototherapy regimes based on the patients initial response that include for example personalised delivery schedules (i.e., 3x weekly vs. 5x weekly phototherapy). Therefore, our work is a crucial step towards precision medicine for psoriasis treatment.",

    "abstract": "Susceptibility to the rubber hand illusion (RHI) varies. Thus far, however, there is no consensus as regards how to explain this variation. Previous studies, focused on the role of multisensory integration, have searched for neural correlates of the illusion. Those studies, however, have failed to identify a sufficient set of functionally specific neural correlates. An alternative explanation of the illusion is that it results from demand characteristics, chiefly variability in the disposition to respond to imaginative suggestion: the degree to which intrinsic neural activity allows for a blurring of boundaries between self and external objects. Some evidence suggests that frontal  power is one means of tracking neural instantiations of self; therefore, we hypothesized that the higher the frontal  power during eyes-closed resting state, the more stable the self. As a corollary, we infer that the more stable the self, the less susceptible are participants to a blurring of boundaries--to feeling that the rubber hand belongs to them. Indeed, we found that frontal  amplitude oscillations negatively correlate with susceptibility. Moreover, since  and {delta} oscillations seem to be associated in pathological states that allow for a blurring of boundaries between self and external objects, we conjectured that the high frontal  power observed in low-RHI participants is modulated by {delta} frequency oscillations. Indeed, we found this to be the case. Based on our findings we propose that the two explanatory frameworks might be complementary: that is, the neural correlates of multisensory integration might be necessary for the RHI, but a sufficient explanation requires investigation of variable intrinsic neural activity that acts to modulate how the brain responds to incompatible sensory stimuli.\n\nHighlights~Intrinsic frontal  power negatively correlates with susceptibility to the RHI.\n~Intrinsic  power modulated by {delta} oscillations varies with susceptibility to the RHI.\n~Sufficient explanation of RHI requires understanding of intrinsic neural dispositions that regulate the boundary between self and the external world.",

    "abstract": "Binocular vision requires proper developmental wiring of eye-specific inputs to the brain. Axons from the two eyes initially overlap in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and undergo activity-dependent competition to segregate into target domains. The synaptic basis of such refinement is unknown. Here we used volumetric super-resolution imaging to measure the nanoscale molecular reorganization of developing retinogeniculate eye-specific synapses in the mouse brain. The outcome of binocular synaptic competition was determined by the relative eye-specific maturation of presynaptic vesicle content. Genetic disruption of spontaneous retinal activity prevented subsynaptic vesicle pool maturation, recruitment of vesicles to the active zone, synaptic development and eye-specific competition. These results reveal an activity-dependent presynaptic basis for axonal refinement in the mammalian visual system.\n\nOne-Sentence SummarySpontaneous activity regulates the nanoscale remodeling of presynaptic terminals underlying eye-specific synaptogenesis and competition.",

    "abstract": "The microbiota of the respiratory tract remains a relatively poorly studied subject. At the same time, like the intestinal microbiota, it is involved in modulating the immune response to infectious agents in the host organism. A causal relationship between the composition of the respiratory microbiota and the likelihood of development and the severity of COVID-19 may be hypothesized. We analyze biomaterial from nasopharyngeal smears from 336 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, selected during the first and second waves of the epidemic in Russia. Sequences from a similar study conducted in Spain were also included in the analysis. We investigated associations between disease severity and microbiota at the level of microbial community (community types) and individual microbes (differentially represented species). To search for associations, we performed multivariate analysis, taking into account comorbidities, type of community and lineage of the virus. We found that two out of six community types are associated with a more severe course of the disease, and one of the community types is characterized by high stability (very similar microbiota profiles in different patients) and low level of lung damage. Differential abundance analysis with respect to comorbidities and community type suggested association of Rothia and Streptococcus genera representatives with more severe lung damage, and Leptotrichia, unclassified Lachnospiraceae and Prevotella with milder forms of the disease.",

A urease producer bacteria, Sporosarcina pasteurii, was used to induce the MICP process for the both simulant soils. An admixture of guar gum as an organic polymer and NiCl2, as bio-catalyst to enhance urease activity, was introduced to increase the compressive strength of the biologically grown bricks. A casting method was utilized for a slurry consisting of the appropriate simulant soil and microbe; the slurry over a few days consolidated in the form of a  brick of the desired shape. In case of MSS, maximum strength of 3.3 MPa was obtained with 10mM NiCl2 and 1% guar gum supplementation whereas in case of LSS maximum strength of 5.65 MPa was obtained with 1% guar gum supplementation and 10mM NiCl2. MICP mediated consolidation of the simulant soil was confirmed with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Our work demonstrates a biological approach with an explicit casting method towards manufacturing of consolidated structures using extra-terrestrial regolith simulant; this is a promising route for in situ development of structural elements on the extra-terrestrial habitats.",

    "abstract": "Leveraging prior viral genome sequencing data to make predictions on whether an unknown, emergent virus harbors a  phenotype-of-concern has been a long-sought goal of genomic epidemiology. A predictive phenotype model built from nucleotide-level information alone has previously been considered un-tenable with respect to RNA viruses due to the ultra-high intra-sequence variance of their genomes, even within closely related clades. Building from our prior work developing a degenerate k-mer method to accommodate this high intra-sequence variation of RNA virus genomes for modeling frameworks, and leveraging a taxonomic  group-shuffle-split paradigm on complete coronavirus assemblies from prior to October 2018, we trained multiple regularized logistic regression classifiers at the nucleotide k-mer level capable of accurately predicting withheld SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences as human pathogens and accurately predicting withheld Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) genome sequences as non-human pathogens. LASSO feature selection identified several degenerate nucleotide predictor motifs with high model coefficients for the human pathogen class that were present across widely disparate classes of coronaviruses. However, these motifs differed in which genes they were present in, what specific codons were used to encode them, and what the translated amino acid motif was. This emphasizes the importance of a phenetic view of emerging pathogenic RNA viruses, as opposed to the canonical phylogenetic interpretations most-commonly used to track and manage viral zoonoses. Applying our model to more recent Orthocoronavirinae genomes deposited since October 2018 yields a novel contextual view of pathogen-potential across bat-related, canine-related, porcine-related, and rodent-related coronaviruses and critical adaptations which may have contributed to the emergence of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Finally, we discuss the utility of these predictive models (and their associated predictor motifs) to novel biosurveillance protocols that substantially increase the  pound-for-pound information content of field-collected sequencing data and make a strong argument for the necessity of routine collection and sequencing of zoonotic viruses.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is causing a global health crisis and has already caused a devastating societal and economic burden. The pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has a high sequence and architecture identity with SARS-CoV, but far more people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. Here, combining structural data from cryo-EM and structure prediction, we constructed bottom-up Martini coarse-grained models of intact SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 envelopes. Microsecond molecular dynamics simulations were performed, allowing us to explore their dynamics and supramolecular organization. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 envelopes present a spherical morphology with structural proteins forming multiple string-like islands in the membrane and clusters between heads of spike proteins. Critical differences between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 envelopes are the interaction pattern between spike proteins and the flexibility of spike proteins. Our models provide structural and dynamic insights in the SARS virus envelopes, and could be used for further investigation, such as drug design, and fusion and fission processes.",

    "abstract": "Rising rates of resistance to antimicrobial drugs threatens the effective treatment of infections across the globe. Drug resistance has been established to emerge from non-genetic mechanisms, such as \"persistence\" in quiescent microbes and fluctuations in gene expression in actively replicating cells, as well as from genetic mutations. However, it is still unclear how non-genetic drug resistance affects the evolution of genetic drug resistance. We develop deterministic and stochastic population models that incorporate resource competition to quantitatively investigate the transition from non-genetic to genetic resistance during the exposure to static and cidal drugs. We find that non-genetic resistance facilitates the survival of cell populations during drug treatment, but that it hinders the development of genetic resistance due to the competition between the non-genetically and genetically resistant subpopulations. Non-genetic drug resistance in the presence of subpopulation competition is found to increase the first-appearance and fixation times of drug resistance mutations, while increasing the probability of mutation before population extinction during cidal drug treatment. Intense intraspecific competition during drug treatment leads to extinction of the susceptible and non-genetically resistant subpopulations. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of the evolution of drug resistance and may guide novel treatment strategies for patients with drug-resistant infections.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEDrug resistance is predicted to kill as many as 10 million people per year and cost over 100 trillion USD in cumulative lost production globally by 2050. To mitigate these socio-economic costs, we need to fundamentally understand the drug resistance process. We investigate the effect that different forms of resistance have on the evolution of drug resistance using mathematical modeling and computer simulations. We find that the presence of non-genetically drug-resistant cells (whose resistance is temporary and not encoded in a genetic mutation) allows the population to survive drug treatment, while competition between these subpopoulations simultaneously slows down the evolution of permanent genetic drug resistance and in some cases drives them extinct. These findings have important implications for advancing evolutionary theory and for developing effective \"resistance-proof\" treatments.",

As an example, and support for future conferences, the decision process to switch during the COVID-19 pandemic from onsite to online, the conception and tools, the experiences of the organisers and the feedback of the participants are described.\n\nMethodsThe CERN tool \"Indico\" served as the central conference management system including public homepage, submission and payment system, abstract review and decision platform, and conference material repository. Zoom, YouTube Live and Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) were utilised for keynotes and other presentation sessions, including livestreaming of pre-recorded presentations. Gather was implemented for poster sessions and individual meetings. An anonymous survey included Likert-type questions on acceptance and quality of the tools and instructions, open questions related to positive and negative issues, and ideas for the next online-conference.\n\nResultsThe event was evaluated well, with mostly fluently working technical solutions. A few participants indicated problems switching from YouTube to Zoom between presentations and discussions. Opinions on pre-recordings of talks were divided. Participants required more time for socialising. Guidelines and materials were mostly rated helpful.\n\nLessons LearnedSimplifying the livestreaming, presenters choice between pre-recording or presenting live, more time for socialising and breaks are discussed. Tools for conducting an online conference should be introduced to the participants in advance. Indico is rated as a very helpful tool for planning and conducting an online-conference.",

These NA viral pseudotypes (PV) possess stable NA activity and can be utilized as target antigens in in vitro assays to assess vaccine immunogenicity. Employing these NA PV, we have developed an enzyme-linked lectin assay (pELLA) for routine serology to measure neuraminidase inhibition (NI) titers of reference antisera, monoclonal antibodies, and post-vaccination sera with various influenza antigens. We have also shown that pELLA is more sensitive than the commercially available NA-Fluor in detecting NA inhibition in these samples. Our studies may lead to establishing the protective NA titer that contributes to NA-based immunity. This will aid in the design of superior, longer lasting, and more broadly protective vaccines that can be employed together with HA-targeted vaccines in a pre-pandemic approach.",

NLRP1 was the first protein discovered to form an inflammasome, but the danger signals and molecular mechanisms that control its activation have not yet been fully established. Here, we report that the NACHT-LRR region of NLRP1 directly binds to oxidized form of thioredoxin-1 (TRX1). We found that NLRP1 requires the ATPase activity of its NACHT domain to associate with TRX1, and that this interaction represses inflammasome activation. Moreover, we discovered that several patient-derived missense mutations in the NACHT-LRR region of NLRP1 weaken TRX1 binding, leading to inflammasome hyperactivation and autoinflammatory disease. Overall, our results establish that oxidized TRX1 binds to and restrains the NLRP1 inflammasome, thereby revealing a link between the cellular redox environment and innate immunity.",

    "abstract": "Temperate bacterial viruses (phages) can transition between lysis - replicating and killing the host, and lysogeny - existing as dormant prophages while keeping the host viable. It was recently shown that upon invading a naive cell, some phages communicate using a peptide signal, termed arbitrium, to control the decision of entering lysogeny. Whether communication can also serve to regulate exit from lysogeny (known as phage induction) remains unclear. Here we show that arbitrium-coding prophages continue to communicate from the lysogenic state by secreting and sensing the arbitrium signal. Signaling represses DNA-damage dependent phage induction, enabling prophages to reduce induction rate when surrounded by other lysogens. We show that the mechanism by which DNA damage and communication are integrated differs between distantly related arbitrium-coding phages. Additionally, signaling by prophages tilts the decision of nearby infecting phages towards lysogeny. Altogether, we find that phages use small molecule communication throughout their entire life-cycle to measure the abundance of lysogens in the population, thus avoiding wasteful attempts at secondary infections when they are unlikely to succeed.",

    "abstract": "The E34 phage is a member of the podoviridae family of phages, (short non-contractile tailed bacteriophages) that uses Salmonella newington as its host. This phage initiates the infection of its host via a specific interaction between its tailspike protein (TSP) and the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of the bacterial. The E34 TSP is structurally similar and functionally equivalent to the P22 phage whose TSP has been well characterized and electron micrographs of both phages appear indistinguishable. The crystal structure of P22 phage TSP in complex with the O-antigen of S. typhimurium has been determined; and the active site of the TSP demonstrated to be the residues Asp392, Asp395 and Glu359 of the receptor binding domain. In another phage called E15, a phylogenetic relative of E34 phage, a short polysaccharide consisting of  repeating units is responsible for the interaction between the E15 phage and Salmonella anatums LPS leading to the adsorption of the phage to the bacteria. Studies on E34 phage shows that it interacts with Salmonella newingtons O antigen polysaccharide component of the LPS, this polysaccharide consists of mannosyl-rhamnosyl-galactose repeating units joined together by {beta}-galactosyl linkages. However, no data exist regarding the specific residues of E34 TSP that are responsible for LPS binding and hydrolysis. In this study, the tailspike gene was cloned onto vector pET30a-LIC and expressed as a fusion protein termed the extended E34 TSP (EE34 TSP). We characterized the protein based on resistance to heat, SDS, and proteases; showing that the protein is heat resistant, shows aberrant electrophoretic mobility in the presence of SDS gradient, and actively binds to P22 phage heads to form hybrid phages that cannot infect P22 host. We also demonstrate via in silico study that the E34 TSP binds to and hydrolyses the O-antigen of its host via the ALA250, SER279 and ASP280 residues. Finally, testing E34 phage ability to protect Vero cells from Salmonella infection shows highly encouraging results, implying that E34 phage can be used in therapeutic/preventive medicine.",

    "abstract": "It is known that animal-associated microbiomes form indispensable relationships with hosts and are responsible for many functions important for host-survival. Next-gen driven approaches documenting the remarkable diversity of microbiomes have burgeoned, with amphibians too, benefiting from such treatments. The microbiome of Gymnophiona (caecilians), one of the three amphibian orders, constituting of 3% of amphibians, however, remains almost unknown. The present study aims to address this knowledge gap through analysis of the microbiome of Ichthyophis bannanicus. As these caecilian larvae are aquatic and hence exposed to a greater propensity for bacterial microbiomic interchange, we hypothesize that bacterial phyla would overlap between gut and skin. Further, from the host-specificity patterns observed in other vertebrate taxa, we hypothesize that Gymnophiona have different dominant gut bacterial microbiomes at a higher taxonomic level when compared to the larvae of the other two amphibian orders (Anura and Caudata). We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing based on Illumina Nova sequencing platform to characterize and compare the gut (represented by faecal samples) and skin microbiome of I. bannanicus larvae (N = 13), a species distributed across South-East-Asia and the only caecilian species occurring in China. We compared our gut microbiome results with published anuran and caudate larval microbiomes. For I. bannanicus, a total of 4,053 operational taxonomic units (OTU) across 13 samples were detected. Alpha-diversity indices were significant between gut and skin samples. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis suggest that gut and skin samples each contained a distinct microbiome at OTU level. We record significant differences between the bacterial phyla of gut and skin samples in larvae of I. bannanicus. The study provides an overview of gut and skin bacterial microbiomes of a caecilian, while highlighting the major differences between larval microbiomes of the three amphibian orders. We find a partial overlap of gut bacterial microbiomes at phylum level for the three orders; however, the relative abundance of the dominant phyla is distinct. The skin and gut microbiomes are distinct with little overlap of species, highlighting that gut-skin axis is weak. This in turn suggests that many of the microbial species on skin and gut are functionally specialized to those locations. We also show that the skin microbiome is more diverse than the gut microbiome at species level; however, a reason for this could be a portion of the gut microbiome not being represented in faecal samples. These first microbiome information from a caecilian lay the foundation for comparative studies of the three amphibian orders.",

In this context, ABA-induced antioxidant defence is considered to be a main mechanism to that enhances water stress tolerance in plants. The specific details of this activation remain, however, elusive. In this work, we show that DIP1, a protein from novel R3H family, played a central role in modulating water stress tolerance in rice. OsDIP1 transcripts were induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ABA, drought (polyethylene glycol treatment), and salt stress. Overexpression of OsDIP1 in rice enhanced drought and salinity tolerance while knocking out OsDIP1 by CRISPR-Cas9 editing resulted in drought and salt sensitive phenotype. The activity and gene expression of antioxidant defence enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), increased in OsDIP1-overexpressed transgenic rice plants, while the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) decreased. In contrast, the content and gene expression of SOD and CAT, decreased, and the content of MDA increased in knockout of OsDIP1 rice plants, suggesting that overexpression of OsDIP1 enhances the antioxidant capacity of rice plants. The yeast two hybrid screening test revealed that OsDIP1 interacted with ZFP36, a key zinc finger transcription factor involved in ABA-induced antioxidant defence. Moreover, OsDIP1 could modulate some key ABA-responsive genes via interacting with ZFP36. Overall, our findings indicate an important role of OsDIP1 in ABA-induced antioxidant defence signaling and adaptation to salinity and drought in rice.",

A key component to this is that global transcription rates increase in larger cells, but the underlying mechanism has remained unknown. Here, we identify RNAPII as the major limiting factor increasing transcription with cell size in budding yeast as transcription is highly sensitive to the dosage of RNAPII but not to other components of the general transcriptional machinery. Our experiments support a dynamic equilibrium model where global transcription at a given size is set by the mass-action recruitment kinetics of unengaged nucleoplasmic RNAPII, and DNA content. This drives a sub-linear increase in transcription with size, which is precisely compensated for by a decrease in mRNA decay rates as cells enlarge. Thus, limiting RNAPII and feedback on mRNA stability work in concert to ensure mRNA concentration homeostasis in growing cells.",

    "abstract": "Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are involved in antiviral defense and gene regulation. Although roles of RNA-dependent RNA Polymerases (RdRPs) in sRNA biology are extensively studied in nematodes, plants and fungi, understanding of RdRP homologs in other animals is still lacking. Here, we study sRNAs in the ISE6 cell line, which is derived from the black-legged tick, an important vector of human and animal pathogens. We find abundant classes of [~]22nt sRNAs that require specific combinations of RdRPs and sRNA effector proteins (Argonautes or AGOs). RdRP-dependent sRNAs possess 5- monophosphates and are mainly derived from RNA polymerase III-transcribed genes and repetitive elements. Knockdown of RdRPs misregulates genes including RNAi-related genes and the regulator of immune response Dsor1. Sensor assays demonstrate that Dsor1 is downregulated by RdRP through the 3UTR that contains a target site of RdRP-dependent repeat-derived sRNAs. Consistent with viral gene repression by the RNAi mechanism using virus-derived small interfering RNAs, viral transcripts are upregulated by AGO knockdown. On the other hand, RdRP knockdown unexpectedly results in downregulation of viral transcripts. This effect is dependent on Dsor1, suggesting that antiviral immunity is enhanced by RdRP knockdown through Dsor1 upregulation. We propose that tick sRNA pathways control multiple aspects of immune response via RNAi and regulation of signaling pathways.\n\nAuthor summaryRNA-dependent RNA Polymerases (RdRPs) are essential for biogenesis of small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) in many organisms such as plants and fungi, but its general importance in animals besides nematodes remains controversial because experimental evidence is lacking. By using a tick cell line, we demonstrate that RdRP-dependent sRNAs are abundantly expressed and tick RdRPs regulate gene expression. These results indicate that ticks have unexpectedly complex sRNA biogenesis pathways that are essential for proper gene regulation. Interestingly, we show that RdRP negatively regulates immune response by changing expression of a gene that is essential in an immunity-related signaling pathway. Because ticks are important vectors of human and animal pathogens, studying the novel tick sRNA pathways and their effects on immune signaling may lead to a better understanding of vector-virus interactions.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a metabolic disorder associated with abnormal glucose homeostasis and is characterized by intrinsic defects in {beta}-cell function and mass. Trimethylguanosine synthase 1 (TGS1) is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme that methylates small nuclear and nucleolar RNAs (snRNAs and snoRNAs) and is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, transcription, and ribosome production. However, the role of TGS1 in {beta}-cells and glucose homeostasis had not been explored. Here we show that TGS1 is upregulated by insulin and upregulated in islets from mice exposed to a high-fat diet and in human {beta}-cells from T2D donors. Using mice with conditional ({beta}TGS1KO and {beta}TGS1Het) and inducible (MIP-CreERT-TGS1KO) TGS1 deletion, we determine that TGS1 regulates {beta}-cell mass and function. Unbiased approaches allowed us to identify a link between TGS1 and ER stress and cell cycle arrest and how TGS1 regulates {beta}-cell apoptosis. Deletion of TGS1 results in an increase in the unfolded protein response by increasing XBP-1, ATF-4, and the phosphorylation of eIF2, and several changes in cell cycle inhibitors and activators such as p27 and Cyclin D2. This study establishes TGS1 as a key player regulating {beta}-cell mass and function as well as playing a role in the adaptive {beta}-cell function to a high-fat diet. These observations can be used as a stepping-stone for the design of novel strategies using TGS1 as a therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes.",

We examined hematopoiesis in mice conditionally deficient in long-chain fatty acid oxidation (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2, Cpt2), glutaminolysis (glutaminase, Gls), or mitochondrial pyruvate import (mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 2, Mpc2). While genetic ablation of Cpt2 or Gls minimally impacted most blood lineages, deletion of Mpc2 led to a sharp decline in mature myeloid cells. However, MPC2-deficient myeloid cells rapidly recovered due to a transient increase in myeloid progenitor proliferation. Competitive bone marrow chimera and stable isotope tracing experiments demonstrated that this proliferative burst was intrinsic to MPC2-deficient progenitors and accompanied by a metabolic switch to glutaminolysis. Thus, hematopoietic progenitors intrinsically adjust to metabolic perturbations independently of feedback from downstream mature cells to maintain homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Mapping of allelic imbalance (AI) at heterozygous loci has the potential to establish links between genetic risk for disease and biological function. Leveraging multi-omics data for AI analysis and functional annotation, we discovered a novel functional risk variant rs1047643 at 8p23 in association with SLE. This variant displays dynamic AI of chromatin accessibility and allelic expression on FDFT1 gene in B cells with SLE. We further found a B-cell restricted super-enhancer (SE) that physically contacts with this SNP-residing locus, an interaction that also appears specifically in B cells. Quantitative analysis of open chromatin and DNA methylation profiles further demonstrated that the SE exhibits aberrant activity in B cell development with SLE. Functional studies identified that STAT3, a master factor associated with autoimmune diseases, directly regulates both the AI of risk variant and the activity of SE in cultured B cells. Our study reveals that STAT3-mediated SE activity and cis-regulatory effects of SNP rs1047643 at 8p23 locus are associated with B cell deregulation in SLE.",

    "abstract": "Efficient, targeted integration of large DNA constructs represent a significant hurdle in genetic engineering for the development of mouse models of human disease and synthetic biology research. To address this, we developed a system for efficient and precise, targeted single-copy integration of large transgenes directly into the zygote using multiple mouse genetic backgrounds. Conventional approaches, such as random transgenesis, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR), lentivirus-based insertion, or DNA transposases all have significant limitations. Our strategy uses in vivo Bxb1 mediated recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) to efficiently generate precise single-copy integrations of transgenes. This is achieved using a transgene \"landing pad\" composed of dual heterologous Bxb1 attachment (att) sites in cis, pre-positioned in the Gt(ROSA)26Sor safe harbor locus. Successful RMCE is achieved in att carrier zygotes using donor DNA carrying cognate attachment sites flanking the desired donor transgene microinjected along with Bxb1-integrase mRNA. This approach routinely achieves perfect vector-free integration of donor constructs at efficiencies as high as 43% and has generated transgenic animals containing inserts up to [~]43kb. Furthermore, when coupled with a nanopore-based Cas9-targeted sequencing (nCATS) approach, complete verification of the precise insertion sequence can be achieved. As a proof-of-concept we describe the creation and characterization of C57BL/6J and NSG Krt18-ACE2 transgenic mouse models for SARS-CoV2 research with verified heterozygous N1 animals available for experimental use in [~]4 months. In addition, we created a diverse series of mouse backgrounds carrying a single att site version of the landing pad allele in C57BL/6J, NSG, B6(Cg)-Tyrc-2J/J, FVB/NJ, PWK/PhJ, 129S1/SvImJ, A/J, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HILtJ, CAST/EiJ, and DBA/2J for rapid transgene insertion. Combined, this system enables predictable, rapid creation of precisely targeted transgenic animals across multiple genetic backgrounds, simplifying characterization, speeding expansion and use.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin modifications are key epigenetic regulatory features with roles in various cellular events, yet histone mark identification, gene wide distribution and relationship to gene expression remains understudied in green algae. Histone lysine methylation is regarded as an active chromatin mark in many organisms, and is implicated in mediating active euchromatin. We interrogated the genome wide distribution pattern of mono- and trimethylated H3K4 using Chromatin-Immunoprecipitation followed by deep-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) during key phases of the Chlamydomonas cell cycle: early G1 phase (ZT1) when cells initiate biomass accumulation, S/M phase (ZT13) when cells are undergoing DNA replication and mitosis, and late G0 phase (ZT23) when they are quiescent. Tri-methylated H3K4 was predominantly enriched at TSSs of the majority of protein coding genes (85%). The likelihood of a gene being marked by H3K4me3 correlated with it being transcribed at one or more time points during the cell cycle but not necessarily by continuous active transcription. This finding even applied to early zygotic genes whose expression may be dormant for hundreds or thousands of generations between sexual cycles; but core meiotic genes were completely missing H3K4me3 peaks at their TSS. In addition, bi-directional promoters regulating expression of replication dependent histone genes, had transient H3K4me3 peaks that were present only during S/M phase when their expression peaked. In agreement with biochemical studies, mono-methylated H3K4 was the default state for the vast majority of histones that were outside of TSS and terminator regions of genes. A small fraction of the genome which was depleted of any H3 lysine methylation was enriched for DNA cytosine methylation and the genes within these DNA methylation islands were poorly expressed. Genome wide H3K4me3 ChIP-Seq data will be a valuable resource, facilitating gene structural annotation, as exemplified by our validation of hundreds of long non-coding RNA genes.",

    "abstract": "Background\n\nHuanglongbing (HLB) is the most serious disease of citrus. HLB is caused by the obligate, intracellular bacterium \"Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus\" (CLas). CLas is transmitted by Diaphorina citri, the Asian citrus psyllid. Development of transmission blocking strategies to manage HLB relies on knowledge of CLas-D. citri interactions at the molecular level. Prior transcriptome analyses of CLas-infected and un-infected D. citri point to changes in psyllid biology due to CLas-infection. These studies relied on incomplete versions of the D. citri genome, lacked proper host plant controls, and/or were analyzed using different statistical approaches. Therefore, we used standardized experimental and computational approaches to identify differentially expressed genes in both CLas (+) and CLas (-) D. citri. The comparative analysis utilized the newest chromosomal length D. citri genome assembly Diaci_v3. In this work, we present a quantitative transcriptome analysis of excised heads, salivary glands, midguts and bacteriomes from CLas (+) and CLas (-) insects.\n\nResults\n\nEach organ had unique transcriptome profiles and responses to CLas infection. Though most psyllids were infected with CLas, CLas-derived transcripts were not detected in all organs. By analyzing the midgut dataset using both the Diaci_v1.1 and v3.0 D. citri genomes, we showed that improved genome assembly led to significant and quantifiable differences in RNAseq data interpretation.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur results support the hypothesis that future transcriptome studies on circulative, vector-borne pathogens should be conducted at the tissue specific level using complete, chromosomal-length genome assemblies for the most accurate understanding of pathogen-induced changes in vector gene expression.",

    "abstract": "To rationally engineer more efficient cellulolytic enzymes for cellulosic biomass deconstruction into sugars for biofuels production, it is necessary to better understand the complex enzyme-substrate interfacial interactions. Carbohydrate binding modules (CBM) are often associated with microbial surface-tethered cellulosomal or freely secreted cellulase enzymes to increase substrate accessibility. However, it is not well known how CBM recognize, bind, and dissociate from polysaccharide surfaces to facilitate efficient cellulolytic activity due to the lack of mechanistic understanding of CBM-substrate interactions. Our work outlines a general approach to methodically study the unbinding behavior of CBMs from model polysaccharide surfaces using single-molecule force spectroscopy. Here, we apply acoustic force spectroscopy (AFS) to probe a Clostridium thermocellum cellulosomal scaffoldin protein (CBM3a) and measure its dissociation from nanocellulose surfaces at physiologically relevant, low force loading rates. An automated microfluidic setup and methodology for uniform deposition of insoluble polysaccharides on the AFS chip surfaces is demonstrated. The rupture forces of wild-type CBM3a, and its Y67A mutant, unbinding from nanocellulose surface suggests distinct CBM binding conformations that can also explain the improved cellulolytic activity of cellulase tethered to CBM. Applying established dynamic force spectroscopy theory, the single-molecule unbinding rate at zero force is extrapolated and found to agree well with bulk equilibrium unbinding rates estimated independently using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring. However, our results highlight the limitations of applying classical theory to explain the highly multivalent CBM-cellulose interactions seen at higher cellulose-CBM bond rupture forces (>15pN).\n\nSignificance StatementCellulases are multi-modular enzymes produced by numerous microbes that catalyze cellulose hydrolysis into glucose. These enzymes play an important role in global carbon cycling as well as cellulosic biofuels production. CBMs are essential components of cellulolytic enzymes involved in facilitating hydrolysis of polysaccharides by tethered catalytic domains (CD). The subtle interplay between CBM binding and CD activity is poorly understood particularly for heterogeneous reactions at solid-liquid interfaces. Here, we report a highly multiplexed single-molecule force spectroscopy method to study CBM dissociation from cellulose to infer the molecular mechanism governing substrate recognition and dissociation. This approach can be broadly applied to study multivalent protein-polysaccharide binding interactions relevant to other carbohydrates such as starch, chitin, or hyaluronan to engineer efficient biocatalysts.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs), released by most cell types, provide an excellent source of biomarkers in biological fluids. Here we describe a method that, using just a few microliters of patients plasma, identifies tumour markers exposed on EVs. Studying physico-chemical properties of EVs in solution, we demonstrate that they behave as stable colloidal suspensions and therefore, in immunocapture assays, many of them are unable to interact with a stationary functionalised surface. Using flocculation methods, like those used to destabilize colloids, we demonstrate that cationic polymers increase EV {zeta}-potential, diameter, and sedimentation coefficient and thus, allow a more efficient capture on antibody-coated surfaces by both ELISA and bead-assisted flow cytometry. These findings led to optimization of a protocol in microtiter plates allowing effective immunocapture of EVs, directly in plasma without previous ultracentrifugation or other EV enrichment. The method, easily adaptable to any laboratory, has been validated using plasma from lung cancer patients in which the epithelial cell marker EpCAM has been detected on EVs. This high throughput, easy to automate, technology allows screening of large numbers of patients to phenotype tumour markers in circulating EVs, breaking barriers for the validation of proposed EV biomarkers and the discovery of new ones.",

    "abstract": "Many cancer cells become dependent on glutamine metabolism to compensate for glycolysis being uncoupled from the TCA cycle. The mitochondrial enzyme Glutaminase C (GAC) satisfies this  glutamine addiction by catalyzing the first step in glutamine metabolism, making it an attractive drug target. Despite one of the allosteric inhibitors (CB-839) being in clinical trials, none of the drugs targeting GAC are approved for cancer treatment and their mechanism of action is not well understood. A major challenge has been the rational design of better drug candidates: standard cryo-cooled X-ray crystal structures of GAC bound to CB-839 and its analogs fail to explain their potency differences. Here, we address this problem by using an emerging technique, serial room temperature crystallography, which enabled us to observe clear differences between the binding conformations of inhibitors with significantly different potencies. A computational model was developed to further elucidate the molecular basis of inhibitor potency. We then corroborated the results from our modeling efforts by using recently established fluorescence assays that directly read-out inhibitor binding to GAC. Together, these findings provide new insights into the mechanisms used by a major class of allosteric GAC inhibitors and for the future rational design of more potent drug candidates.",

Here we report a streamlined method applicable for the ultrahigh-throughput screening of an artificial metalloenzyme (ArM), an artificial deallylase (ADAse), in double emulsions. The DE-protocol was validated by screening a four hundred member, double-mutant streptavidin library for the CpRu-catalyzed uncaging of aminocoumarin. The most active variants, identified by next generation sequencing of the sorted DE droplets with highest fluorescent intensity, are in good agreement with 96-well plate screening hits. These findings, thus, pave the way towards the systematic implementation of commercially available FACS for the directed evolution of metalloenzymes making ultrahigh-throughput screening more broadly accessible.

    "abstract": "The majority of cancer patients is treated with ionizing radiation (IR), a relatively safe and effective treatment considered to target tumors by inducing DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Despite clinical interest in increasing the efficacy of IR by preventing successful DSB repair, few effective radio-adjuvant therapies exist. Extensive literature suggests that chromatin modifiers play a role in the DSB repair and thus may represent a novel class of radiosensitizers. Indeed, chromatin has both local and global impacts on DSB formation, recognition of breaks, checkpoint signaling, recruitment of repair factors, and timely DSB resolution, suggesting that epigenetic deregulation in cancer may impact the efficacy of radiotherapy. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry proteomics to analyze global patterns of histone modification in MCF7 breast cancer cells following IR exposure, we find significant and long-lasting changes to the epigenome. Our results confirm that H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), best known for mediating gene repression and regulating cell fate, increases after IR. H3K27me3 changes rapidly, accumulating at sites of DNA damage. Inhibitors of the Polycomb related complex subunit and H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 confirm that H3K27me3 is necessary for DNA damage recognition and cell survival after IR. These studies provide an argument for evaluating EZH2 as a radiosensitization target and H3K27me3 as a marker for radiation response in cancer.

    "abstract": "Global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has increased considerably in the recent decades. Overactivity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), associated to renal inflammation and fibrosis contribute to its evolution. The treatments currently employed to control CKD progression are limited and mainly based on the pharmacological inhibition of RAAS, associated with diuretics and immunosuppressive drugs. However, this conservative management promotes only partial deceleration of CKD evolution, and does not completely avoid the progression of the disease and the loss of renal function, which motivates the medical and scientific community to investigate new therapeutic approaches to detain renal inflammation / fibrosis and CKD progression. Recent studies have shown the application of mesenchymal stem cells (mSC) to exert beneficial effects on the renal tissue of animals submitted to experimental models of CKD. In this context, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of subcapsular application of adipose tissue-derived mSC (ASC) in rats submitted to the 5/6 renal ablation model, 15 days after the establishment of CKD, when the nephropathy was already severe. We also verify whether ASC associated to Losartan, would promote greater renoprotection when compared to the respective monotherapies. Animals were followed until 30 days of CKD, when body weight, systolic blood pressure, biochemical, histological, immunohistochemical and gene expression analysis were performed. The combination of ASC and Losartan was more effective than Losartan monotherapy in reducing systolic blood pressure and glomerulosclerosis, and also promoted the complete normalization of proteinuria and albuminuria, a significant reduction in renal interstitial macrophage infiltration and downregulation of renal IL-6 gene expression. The beneficial effects of ACS are possibly due to the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory role of factors secreted by these cells, modulating the local immune response. Although studies are still required, our results demonstrated that a subcapsular inoculation of ASC, associated with the administration of Losartan, exerted additional renoprotective effect in rats submitted to a severe model of established CKD, when compared to Losartan monotherapy, thus suggesting ASC may be a potential adjuvant to RAAS-blockade therapy currently employed in the conservative management of CKD.",

Tendon and ligament attachments (i.e., entheses) are often found at bony protrusions (i.e., eminences), and the shape and size of these protrusions depends on both mechanical forces and cellular cues during growth and development. The formation of tendon eminences also contributes to mechanical leverage for skeletal muscle. Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling plays a critical role in bone development, and Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 are highly expressed in the perichondrium and periosteum of bone where tendon and ligament attachments can be found. However, the role of FGFR signaling in attachment development and maintenance in the limb remains unknown. In this study, we used transgenic mouse models for combinatorial knockout of Fgfr1 and/or Fgfr2 in tendon/ligament and attachment progenitors using ScxCre and measured eminence size and bone shape in the appendicular skeleton. Conditional deletion of both, but not individual, Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 in Scx progenitors led to enlarged eminences in the postnatal appendicular skeleton and smaller secondary ossification centers in long bones. In addition, Fgfr1 Fgfr2 double conditional knockout mice had more variation in the size of collagen fibrils in tendon, narrowed synovial joint spacing, and increased cell death at sites of ligament attachments, as well as decreased plasticity of mature bone compared to age-matched wildtype littermates. These findings identify a role for FGFR signaling in regulating growth and maintenance of tendon/ligament attachments and the size and shape of bony eminences.",

    "abstract": "CD4+ T cells are critical orchestrators of immune responses against a large variety of pathogens, including viruses. The multifaceted roles of CD4+ T cells, including their help to innate cells, CD8+ T and B cells and their support for long-lived immunity rely on a profound functional heterogeneity. While multiple CD4+ T cell subtypes and their key transcriptional regulators have been identified, there is a lack of consistent definition for CD4+ T cell transcriptional states. In addition, the progressive changes affecting CD4+ T cell subtypes during and after immune responses remain poorly defined. Taking advantage of single-cell transcriptomics, efficient computational methods, and robust animal models, we characterize the transcriptional landscape of CD4+ T cells responding to self-resolving and chronic viral infections. We build a comprehensive atlas of virus-specific CD4+ T cells and their evolution over time, and identify six major distinct cell states that are consistently observed in acute and chronic infections. During the course of acute infection, T cell composition progressively changes from effector to memory states, with subtype-specific gene modules and kinetics. Conversely, T cells in persistent infections fail to transition from effector to memory states, and acquire distinct, chronicity-associated transcriptional programs. By single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing analysis, we characterize the clonal structure of virus-specific CD4+ T cells across individuals and T cell subtypes. We find that virus-specific CD4+ T cell responses are mainly private across individuals and that most T cells differentiate into all subtypes independently of their TCR, in both acute and chronic infections. Finally, we show that our CD4+ T cell atlas can be used as a reference to accurately interpret cell states in external single-cell datasets. Overall, this study describes a previously unappreciated level of adaptation of the transcriptional states of CD4+ T cells responding to viruses and provides a new computational resource for CD4+ T cell analysis, available online at https://spica.unil.ch.",

    "abstract": "Prion infections cause conformational changes of PrPC and lead to progressive neurological impairment. Here we show that toxic, prion-mimetic ligands induce an intramolecular R208-H140 hydrogen bond (\"H-latch\") altering the flexibility of the 2-3 and {beta}2-2 loops of PrPC. Expression of a PrP2Cys mutant mimicking the H-latch was constitutively toxic, whereas a PrPR207A mutant unable to form the H-latch conferred resistance to prion infection. High-affinity ligands that prevented H-latch induction repressed prion-related neurodegeneration in organotypic cerebellar cultures. We then selected phage-displayed ligands binding wild-type PrPC, but not PrP2Cys. These binders depopulated H-latched conformers and conferred protection against prion toxicity. Finally, brain-specific expression of an antibody rationally designed to prevent H-latch formation, prolonged the life of prion-infected mice despite unhampered prion propagation, confirming that the H-latch is causally linked to prion neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveIn the past, the zokor, which lived in northern China, caused great harm to agriculture and forestry production due to its large and sophisticated diet. Since the rat lives underground for most of its life, researchers know little about its dietary habits. Further understanding of its diet in the field is of important meaning for developing green and sustainable control strategies for the rat.\n\nMethodsLongde County in Liupan Mountain area of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region was selected as the interest area to capture zokor and investigate the species of habitat plants.We selected chloroplast trnL gene and eukaryotic internal transcription spacer 1 (ITS 1) primers to amplify DNA from the gastric contents of zokor,and then sequenced on Illumina Miseq PE300 platform.\n\nResultsThe gastric contents of Eospalax smithii (n=16) and E.cansus(n=9) were analyzed by operational taxonomic units (OTU) clustering and amplicon sequence variants(ASVs).The OTU clustering method obtained 2,995 OTUs, and the ASV method obtained 4,657 ASVs. The ASV method was better than the OTU clustering method, and the ASV method was adopted in the subsequent analysis. The food list of 32 families, 80 genera and 154 species was obtained by ASV method after the error was removed. The food composition of zokor was evaluated by relative abundance(%RA) method and frequency of occurrence(%ROO) method. At the Family level, it was found that zokor mainly fed on Asteraceae, Poaceae, Rosaceae, Pinaceae, Brassicaceae, Apiaceae, etc. At the Genus level, they are mainlyEchinops, Littledalea,Artemisia,Picea, Cirsium, Elymus and so on. The diet alpha diversity of E.cansus was slightly higher than that of E.smithii (P > 0.05). The correlation coefficient between Sobs index of alpha diversity and body weight of zokor was -0.382 (P = 0.059). The diet beta diversity proved that most zokors (22/25) clustered together, with low heterogeneity. They fed positively on Calamagrostis, Cirsium, Echinops, Medicago, Sanguisorba and Taraxacum. We found that zokor mainly fed on the roots of perennial herbs(PH), which were rich in water, carbohydrate, fat and protein, which provided an important energy source for its survival.\n\nConclusionHigh-throughput sequencing(HTS) based DNA metabarcoding technology has well revealed the diet of zokor, which are generalist.",

    "abstract": "Protein structure prediction has long been considered a gateway problem for understanding protein folding. Recent advances in deep learning have achieved unprecedented success at predicting a proteins crystal structure, but whether this achievement relates to a better modelling of the folding process remains an open question. In this work, we compare the pathways generated by state-of-the-art protein structure prediction methods to experimental folding data. The methods considered were AlphaFold 2, RoseTTAFold, trRosetta, RaptorX, DMPfold, EVfold, SAINT2 and Rosetta. We find evidence that their simulated dynamics capture some information about the folding pathwhay, but their predictive ability is worse than a trivial classifier using sequence-agnostic features like chain length. The folding trajectories produced are also uncorrelated with parameters such as intermediate structures and the folding rate constant. These results suggest that recent advances in protein structure prediction do not yet provide an enhanced understanding of the principles underpinning protein folding.",

    "abstract": "Egyptian fruit bats are experimental animals of increasing interest because they have been identified as a natural reservoir for several emerging zoonotic viruses. For this reason, bats could undergo different experimental procedures that require sedation or anaesthesia. Our aim was to compare the effects of two balanced anaesthetic protocols on sedation, cardiopulmonary variables and recovery in bats undergoing gonadectomy. Twenty bats were randomized into two groups; patients in group DK received intramuscular injection of dexmedetomidine (40 g kg-1) and ketamine (7 mg kg-1), whereas those in group DBM were anaesthetized with intramuscular dexmedetomidine (40 g kg-1), butorphanol (0.3 mg kg-1) and midazolam (0.3 mg kg-1). Time of induction, cardiopulmonary parameters and anaesthetic depth were measured. If anaesthesia plan was considered inadequate, fraction of inspired isoflurane was titrate-to-effect to achieve immobility. At the end of the surgery venous blood gas analysis was performed and intramuscular atipamezole (200 g kg-1) or atipamezole (200 g kg-1) and flumazenil (0.03 mg kg-1) was administered for timed and scored recovery phase. A significantly higher heart rate and peripheral oxygen saturation were recorded in DBM group (p = 0.001; p = 0.003 respectively), while respiratory rate was significantly lower than DK group (p = 0.001). All bats required isoflurane supplementation during surgery with no significant difference. No differences were observed in rectal temperature, induction and recovery times. Sodium and chlorine where significantly higher in DBM group (p = 0.001; p = 0.002 respectively). Recovery scores in group DK were significantly better than in group DBM (p = 0.034). Both protocols induced anaesthesia in Egyptian fruit bats with comparable sedative and cardiorespiratory effect. These drug combinations may be useful for minor procedures in bats, and they could be associated with inhalation anaesthesia in determining and maintaining a surgical anaesthetic plan.",

NLRP3 activation induces ASC polymerization into a single, micron-scale perinuclear punctum. Higher resolution imaging of this signaling platform is needed to understand how it induces pyroptosis. Here, we apply correlative cryo-light microscopy and cryo-electron tomography to visualize ASC/caspase-1 in NLRP3-activated cells. The puncta are composed of branched ASC filaments, with a tubular core formed by the pyrin domain. Ribosomes and Golgi-like vesicles permeate the filament network, consistent with roles for these organelles in NLRP3 activation. Mitochondria are not associated with ASC but have outer-membrane discontinuities the same size as gasdermin D pores, consistent with our data showing gasdermin D associates with mitochondria and contributes to mitochondrial depolarization.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryElectron tomography of frozen cells reveals the ultrastructure of ASC specks and gasdermin D pores in adjacent mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "Can we cluster bacterial sediment communities based on lake size, depth, and trophic status? Or, are bacterial microbial communities an emergent property of their geography, integrating regional physical and climatic conditions? Lakes in Minnesota are uniquely situated to address these questions because of their wide geographic range and variability in size and basin land-use. In this study, we selected twenty lakes with varying morphological and chemical properties across four ecological regions of Minnesota. Our objectives were to (i)) evaluate the diversity and spatial variation of the bacterial community at the sediment-water interface and (ii) determine how lake location and watershed land-use impact aqueous chemistry and influence community structure. Our data indicate that sediment communities from similar depth intervals are more likely to cluster by ecological region rather than any individual lake properties (e.g., trophic status, TP concentration, lake depth). However, composition is tied to a given lake, wherein samples from the same core were more alike than samples at similar depths across lakes. Our results illustrate the diversity within lake sediment microbial communities and provide insight into relationships between taxonomy, physicochemical, and geographic properties of north temperate lakes.",
