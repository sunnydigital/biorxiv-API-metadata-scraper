    "abstract": "The advent of whole brain clearing and imaging methods extends the breadth and depth at which brain-wide neural populations and structures can be studied. However, these methods have yet to be applied to larger brains, such as the brains of the common laboratory rat, despite the importance of these models in behavioral neuroscience research. Here we introduce AdipoClear+, an optimized immunolabeling and clearing methodology for application to adult rat brain hemispheres, and validate its application through the testing of common antibodies and electrode tract visualization. In order to extend the accessibility of this methodology for general use, we have developed an open source platform for the registration of rat brain volumes to standard brain atlases for high throughput analysis.",

    "abstract": "Changes in trabecular micro-architecture are key to our understanding of osteoporosis. Previous work focusing on structure model index (SMI) measurements have concluded that disease progression entails a shift from plates to rods in trabecular bone, but SMI is heavily biased by bone volume fraction. As an alternative to SMI, we proposed the Ellipsoid Factor (EF) as a continuous measure of local trabecular shape between plate-like and rod-like extremes. We investigated the relationship between EF distributions, SMI and bone volume fraction of the trabecular geometry in a murine model of disuse osteoporosis as well as from human vertebrae of differing bone volume fraction. We observed a moderate shift in EF median (at later disease stages in mouse tibia) and EF mode (in the vertebral samples with low bone volume fraction) towards a more rod-like geometry, but not in EF maximum and minimum. These results support the notion that the plate to rod transition does not coincide with the onset of bone loss and is considerably more moderate, when it does occur, than SMI suggests. A variety of local shapes not straightforward to categorise as rod or plate exist in all our trabecular bone samples.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory control is the ability to suppress inappropriate movements and unwanted actions, allowing to regulate impulses and responses. This ability can be measured via the Stop Signal Task, which provides a temporal index of response inhibition, the stop signal reaction time (SSRT). At the neural level, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) allows to investigate of motor inhibition within the primary motor cortex (M1), such as the Cortical Silent period (CSP). CSPs length is an index of GABAB-mediated intracortical inhibition within M1. Although there is strong evidence that intracortical inhibition varies during action stopping, it is still not clear whether differences in the neurophysiological markers of intracortical inhibition contribute to behavioral differences in actual inhibitory capacities. Hence, we here explored the relationship between intracortical inhibition within M1 and behavioral response inhibition. GABABergic-mediated inhibition in M1 was determined by the length of CSP, while behavioral inhibition was assessed by the SSRT. We found a significant positive correlation between CSPs length and SSRT, namely that individuals with greater levels of GABABergic-mediated inhibition seem to perform overall worse in inhibiting behavioral responses. These results support the assumption that individual differences in intracortical inhibition are mirrored by individual differences in action stopping abilities.",

    "abstract": "Methods for electro- or magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) based brain source imaging (BSI) using sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) have been demonstrated to achieve excellent performance in situations with low numbers of distinct active sources, such as event-related designs. This paper extends the theory and practice of SBL in three important ways. First, we reformulate three existing SBL algorithms under the majorization-minimization (MM) framework. This unification perspective not only provides a useful theoretical framework for comparing different algorithms in terms of their convergence behavior, but also provides a principled recipe for constructing novel algorithms with specific properties by designing appropriate bounds of the Bayesian marginal likelihood function. Second, building on the MM principle, we propose a novel method called LowSNR-BSI that achieves favorable source reconstruction performance in low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) settings. Third, precise knowledge of the noise level is a crucial requirement for accurate source reconstruction. Here we present a novel principled technique to accurately learn the noise variance from the data either jointly within the source reconstruction procedure or using one of two proposed cross-validation strategies. Empirically, we could show that the monotonous convergence behavior predicted from MM theory is confirmed in numerical experiments. Using simulations, we further demonstrate the advantage of LowSNR-BSI over conventional SBL in low-SNR regimes, and the advantage of learned noise levels over estimates derived from baseline data. To demonstrate the usefulness of our novel approach, we show neurophysiologically plausible source reconstructions on averaged auditory evoked potential data.",

    "abstract": "The metabolic heterogeneity, and metabolic interplay between cells and their microenvironment have been known as significant contributors to disease treatment resistance. However, with the lack of a mature high-throughput single cell metabolomics technology, we are yet to establish systematic understanding of intra-tissue metabolic heterogeneity and cooperation phenomena among cell populations. To mitigate this knowledge gap, we developed a novel computational method, namely scFEA (single cell Flux Estimation Analysis), to infer single cell fluxome from single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. scFEA is empowered by a comprehensively reconstructed human metabolic map into a factor graph, a novel probabilistic model to leverage the flux balance constraints on scRNA-seq data, and a novel graph neural network based optimization solver. The intricate information cascade from transcriptome to metabolome was captured using multi-layer neural networks to fully capitulate the non-linear dependency between enzymatic gene expressions and reaction rates. We experimentally validated scFEA by generating an scRNA-seq dataset with matched metabolomics data on cells of perturbed oxygen and genetic conditions. Application of scFEA on this dataset demonstrated the consistency between predicted flux and metabolic imbalance with the observed variation of metabolite abundance in the matched metabolomics data. We also applied scFEA on five publicly available scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics datasets and identified context and cell group specific metabolic variations. The cell-wise fluxome predicted by scFEA empowers a series of downstream analysis including identification of metabolic modules or cell groups that share common metabolic variations, sensitivity evaluation of enzymes with regards to their impact on the whole metabolic flux, and inference of cell-tissue and cell-cell metabolic communications.",

    "abstract": "The use of diverse datasets in phylogenetic studies aiming for understanding evolutionary histories of species can yield conflicting inference. Phylogenetic conflicts observed in animal and plant systems have often been explained by hybridization, incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), or horizontal gene transfer. Here, we employed target enrichment data, species tree and species network approaches to infer the backbone phylogeny of the family Caprifoliaceae, while distinguishing among sources of incongruence. We used 713 nuclear loci and 46 complete plastome sequence data from 43 samples representing 38 species from all major clades to reconstruct the phylogeny of the family using concatenation and coalescence approaches. We found significant nuclear gene tree conflict as well as cytonuclear discordance. Additionally, coalescent simulations and phylogenetic species network analyses suggested putative ancient hybridization among subfamilies of Caprifoliaceae, which seems to be the main source of phylogenetic discordance. Ancestral state reconstruction of six morphological characters revealed some homoplasy for each character examined. By dating the branching events, we inferred the origin of Caprifoliaceae at approximately 66.65 Ma in the late Cretaceous. By integrating evidence from molecular phylogeny, divergence times, and morphology, we herein recognize Zabelioideae as a new subfamily in Caprifoliaceae. This work shows the necessity of using a combination of multiple approaches to identify the sources of gene tree discordance. Our study also highlights the importance of using data from both nuclear and chloroplast genomes to reconstruct deep and shallow phylogenies of plants.",

Although the discriminatory power of the TCR is widely believed to be near-perfect, technical difficulties have hampered efforts to precisely quantify it. Here, we describe a method for measuring very low TCR/pMHC affinities, and use it to measure the discriminatory power of the TCR, and the factors affecting it. We find that TCR discrimination, although enhanced compared with conventional cell-surface receptors, is imperfect: primary human T cells can respond to pMHC with affinities as low as KD ~1 mM. The kinetic proofreading mechanism fit our data, providing the first estimates of both the time delay (2.8 s) and number of biochemical steps (2.67) that are consistent with the extraordinary sensitivity of antigen recognition. Our findings explain why self pMHC frequently induce autoimmune diseases and anti-tumour responses, and suggest ways to modify TCR discrimination.",

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {gamma}TuRC is composed of seven identical {gamma}-tubulin small complex ({gamma}TuSC) sub-assemblies which associate helically to template microtubule growth. {gamma}TuRC assembly provides a key point of regulation for the MT cytoskeleton. Here we combine cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM structures of both monomeric and dimeric {gamma}TuSCs, and open and closed helical {gamma}TuRC assemblies in complex with Spc110p to elucidate the mechanisms of {gamma}TuRC assembly. {gamma}TuRC assembly is substantially aided by the evolutionarily conserved CM1 motif in Spc110p spanning a pair of adjacent {gamma}TuSCs. By providing the highest resolution and most complete views of any {gamma}TuSC assembly, our structures allow phosphorylation sites to be mapped, surprisingly suggesting that they are mostly inhibitory. A comparison of our structures with the CM1 binding site in the human {gamma}TuRC structure at the interface between GCP2 and GCP6 allows for the interpretation of significant structural changes arising from CM1 helix binding to metazoan {gamma}TuRC.",

Here, we investigate the effect of sample size and ancestry composition on PGS performance for fifteen traits in UK Biobank. For some traits, PGS estimated using a relatively small African-ancestry training set outperformed, on an African-ancestry test set, PGS estimated using a much larger European-ancestry only training set. We observe similar, but not identical, results when considering other minority-ancestry groups within UK Biobank.

However, we report here that activating GAD2+ neurons, directly with optogenetics or indirectly by cutaneous stimulation, facilitates sensory feedback to motoneurons in awake rodents and humans. GABAA receptors and GAD2+ innervation at or near nodes of Ranvier of sensory axons cause this facilitation, preventing spike propagation failure at the many axon branch points, which is otherwise common without GABA. In contrast, GABAA receptors are generally lacking from axon terminals (unlike GABAB) and do not presynaptically inhibit transmitter release onto motoneurons. GABAergic innervation near nodes and branch points allows individual branches to function autonomously, with GAD2+ neurons regulating which branches conduct, adding a computational layer to the neuronal networks generating movement and likely generalizing to other CNS axons.",

Angular head velocity (AHV) cells, which encode the speed and direction of head turns during navigation, are fundamental to this process, yet the mechanisms that determine their function remain unknown. By performing chronic single-unit recordings in the retrosplenial cortex (RSP) of the mouse and tracking the activity of individual AHV neurons between freely moving and head-restrained conditions, we find that vestibular inputs dominate AHV signalling. In addition, we discover that self-generated optic flow input onto these neurons increases the gain and signal-to-noise ratio of angular velocity coding during free exploration. Psychophysical experiments and neural decoding further reveal that vestibular-visual integration increases the perceptual accuracy of egocentric angular velocity and the fidelity of its representation by RSP ensembles. We propose that while AHV coding is dependent on vestibular input, it also uses vision to maximise navigation accuracy in nocturnal and diurnal environments.",

    "abstract": "The paranthropines, including Paranthropus boisei and Paranthropus robustus, have often been considered hard-food specialists. The large post-canine teeth, thick enamel, and robust craniofacial features are often suggested to have evolved to cope with habitual mastication of hard foods. Yet, direct evidence for Paranthropus feeding behaviour often challenges these morphological interpretations. The main exception being antemortem tooth chipping which is still regularly used as evidence of habitual mastication of hard foods in this genus. In this study, data were compiled from the literature for six hominin species (including P. boisei and P. robustus) and 17 extant primate species, to analyse Paranthropus chipping patterns in a broad comparative framework. Severity of fractures, position on the dentition, and overall prevalence were compared among species. The results indicate that both Paranthropus species had a lower prevalence of tooth fractures compared to other fossil hominin species (P. boisei: 4%; P. robustus: 11%; Homo naledi: 37%; Australopithecus africanus: 17%; Homo neanderthalensis: 45%; Epipalaeolithic Homo sapiens: 29%); instead, their frequencies are similar to apes that masticate hard items in a non-regular frequency, including chimpanzees, gibbons, and gorillas (4%, 7% and 9% respectively). The prevalence is several times lower than in extant primates known to habitually consume hard items, such as sakis, mandrills, and sooty mangabeys (ranging from 28% to 48%). Comparative chipping analysis suggests that both Paranthropus species were unlikely habitual hard object eaters, at least compared to living durophage analogues.",

    "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are a clinically validated therapeutic option against COVID-19. As rapidly emerging virus mutants are becoming the next major concern in the fight against the global pandemic, it is imperative that these therapeutic treatments provide coverage against circulating variants and do not contribute to development of treatment emergent resistance. To this end, we investigated the sequence diversity of the spike protein and monitored emergence of minor virus variants in SARS-COV-2 isolates found in COVID-19 patients or identified from preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies. This study demonstrates that a combination of non-competing antibodies, REGEN-COV, not only provides full coverage against current variants of concern/interest but also protects against emergence of new such variants and their potential seeding into the population in a clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "RATIONALEAppropriate fibrotic tissue formation after myocardial infarction (MI) is crucial to maintenance of the hearts structure. Reparative or M2-like macrophages play a vital role in post-MI fibrosis by activating cardiac fibroblasts. However, the mechanism by which post-MI cardiac fibrosis is regulated is not fully understood.\n\nOBJECTIVEWe investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms of post-MI fibrotic tissue formation, especially those related to regulation of cellular senescence and apoptosis.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTSIn vivo and in vitro experiments were used to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which post-MI fibrosis occurs, with a focus on the role of M2-like macrophages. Microarray analysis revealed that CD206+F4/80+CD11b+ M2-like macrophages collected from mouse hearts on post-MI day 7 showed increased expression of neuregulin 1 (Nrg1). Nrg1 receptor epidermal growth factor receptor ErbB was expressed on cardiac fibroblasts in the infarct area. In cardiac fibroblasts in which hydrogen peroxide-induced senescence, M2-like macrophage-derived Nrg1 suppressed both senescence and apoptosis of the fibroblasts, whereas blockade of ErbB function significantly accelerated. M2-like macrophage-derived Nrg1/ErbB/PI3K/Akt signaling, which was shown to be related to anti-senescence, was activated in damaged cardiac fibroblasts. Interestingly, systemic blockade of ErbB function in MI model mice enhanced senescence and apoptosis of cardiac fibroblasts and exacerbated inflammation. Further, increased accumulation of M2-like macrophages resulted in excessive progression of fibrosis in post-MI murine hearts. The molecular mechanism underlying regulation of fibrotic tissue formation in the infarcted myocardium was shown in part to be attenuation of apoptosis and senescence of cardiac fibroblasts by activation of Nrg1/ErbB/PI3K/Akt signaling.\n\nCONCLUSIONSM2-like macrophage-mediated regulation of Nrg1/ErbB signaling, have a substantial effect on fibrotic tissue formation in the infarcted adult mouse heart, is critical for suppressing the progression of senescence and apoptosis of cardiac fibroblasts.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for new antiviral targets, as many of the currently approved drugs have proven ineffective against mitigating SARS-CoV-2 infections. The host transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 is a highly promising antiviral target, as it plays a direct role in priming the spike protein before viral entry occurs. Further, unlike other targets such as ACE2, TMPRSS2 has no known biological role. Here we utilize virtual screening to curate large libraries into a focused collection of potential inhibitors. Optimization of a recombinant expression and purification protocol for the TMPRSS2 peptidase domain facilitates subsequent biochemical screening and characterization of selected compounds from the curated collection in a kinetic assay. In doing so, we demonstrate that serine protease inhibitors camostat, nafamostat, and gabexate inhibit through a covalent mechanism. We further identify new non-covalent compounds as TMPRSS2 protease inhibitors, demonstrating the utility of a combined virtual and experimental screening campaign in rapid drug discovery efforts.",

    "abstract": "Genetic deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha glucosidase or acid maltase (GAA) results in Pompe disease (PD), encompassing at least five clinical subtypes of varying severity. The current approved enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for PD is via IV infusion every 2 weeks of a recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) secreted by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (alglucosidase alfa/Myozyme, Sanofi/Genzyme). Although alglucosidase alfa has proven to be efficient in rescuing cardiac abnormalities and extending the life span of the infantile form, the response in skeletal muscle is variable. ERT usually begins when the patients are symptomatic and secondary problems are already present which are compounded by low alglucosidase alfa uptake, transient nature (every 2 weeks with a rapid return to defect levels), variable glycogen reduction, autophagic accumulation, immune response and high cost. A consensus at a recent US Acid Maltase Deficiency (AMD) conference suggested that a multi-pronged approach including gene therapy, diet, exercise, etc. must be evaluated for a successful treatment of PD. Compared to replication defective viruses, non-viral gene transfer offers fewer safety concerns and, if recent studies are validated, has a wider range of cells. In order for gene therapy (GT) to succeed, the gene of interest must be delivered into the affected cell and expressed to overcome the inherited deficiency. Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) enter eukaryotic cells through an energy-independent mechanism and efficiently carry biologically active and therapeutic molecules into cells and localize in the cytoplasm or nucleus. CPPs are usually covalently linked to the cargo, including peptides and DNA. Crotamine (Cro) from the South American rattlesnake-Crotalus durrissus terrificus venom, can bind electrostatically to plasmid DNA to deliver into cells, including muscle. We have assembled a bacterial expression vector for Cro and purified the recombinant Cro (rCro). Transient transfection in AMD fibroblasts and ex vivo in whole blood from an adult Pompe patient with rCro complexed with the pcDNA3 x hGAA cDNA demonstrated increased GAA activity. In GAA knockout (KO) mice receiving a single injection of rCro complexed to pcDNA3 x hGAA cDNA intraperitoneally (IP), we found increased GAA activity in tissues after 48 hr. After 8 treatments-IP over 55 days, we found increased vertical hang-time activity, reduced glycogen deposition, increased GAA activity/hGAA plasmid in tissues and minimal immune-reaction to rCro. A subsequent study of 5 administrations every 2 to 3 weeks showed reverse of the clinical phenotypes by running wheel activity, Rotarod, grip-strength meter, open field mobility and T-maze. Tissue culture experiments in PD fibroblast, lymphoid and skeletal muscle cell lines showed increased GAA activity after rCro transient gene delivery.",

We validated EXTRACT on simulated and experimental data and processed 94 public datasets from the Allen Institute Brain Observatory in one day.

Using whole-cell recordings of mouse Purkinje cells, we show 2{delta}-2 is required for functional coupling of postsynaptic voltage-dependent calcium entry with effector mechanisms controlling two different outputs, depolarization-induced suppression of excitation mediated by endocannabinoid signaling, and spike afterhyperpolarization generated by calcium-dependent potassium channels. Our findings indicate an important role for 2{delta}-2 proteins in regulating functional postsynaptic calcium channel-coupling in neurons.\n\nSignificance StatementCalcium influx via membrane voltage-dependent calcium channels drives numerous neuronal processes by signaling through calcium-dependent effector molecules. Signal precision is achieved in part by calcium channel-effector coupling. In mouse Purkinje cell neurons, we show that neuronal 2{delta}-2 protein functionally couples calcium entry to two different postsynaptic calcium-dependent signals, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling and the action potential afterhyperpolarization. Our findings provide new insights about the control of calcium channel-effector coupling as well as new roles for 2{delta}-2 proteins in neurons.",

    "abstract": "Volitional suppression of responses to distracting external stimuli enables us to achieve our goals. This volitional inhibition of a specific behavior is supposed to be mainly mediated by the cerebral cortex. However, recent evidence supports the involvement of the cerebellum in this process. It is currently not known whether different parts of the cerebellar cortex play differential or synergistic roles in planning and execution of this behavior. Here, we measured Purkinje cell (PC) responses in the medial and lateral cerebellum in two rhesus macaques during a pro- and antisaccade task. During an antisaccade trial, non-human primates were instructed to make a saccadic eye movement away from a target, rather than towards it, as in prosaccade trials. Our data shows that the cerebellum plays an important role not only during execution of the saccades, but also during the volitional inhibition of eye movements towards the target. Simple Spike (SS) modulation during the instruction and execution period of pro- and antisaccades was prominent in PCs of both medial and lateral cerebellum. However, only the SS activity in the lateral cerebellar cortex contained information about trial identity and showed a stronger reciprocal interaction with complex spikes. Moreover, SS activity of different PC groups modulated bidirectionally in both regions, but the PCs that showed facilitating and suppressive activity were predominantly associated with instruction and execution, respectively. These findings show that different cerebellar regions and PC groups contribute to goal-directed behavior and volitional inhibition, but with different propensities, highlighting the rich repertoire of cerebellar control in executive functions.\n\nSignificance StatementThe antisaccade task is commonly used in research and clinical evaluation as a test of volitional and flexible control of behavior. It requires volitional suppression of prosaccades, a function that has been attributed to the neocortex. However, recent findings indicate that cerebellum also contributes to this behavior. We recorded from neurons in the medial and lateral cerebellum to evaluate their responses in this task. We found that both regions significantly modulated their activity during this task, but only cells in the lateral cerebellum encoded the stimulus identity in each trial. These results indicate that the cerebellum actively contributes to the control of flexible behavior and that lateral and medial cerebellum play different roles during volitional eye movements.",

Therefore, we aimed to study epithelial regeneration ability in CD using an intestinal organoid model. Further, since tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) is a major proinflammatory effector during CD pathogenesis, we also investigated TNF-induced alteration of regeneration ability in CD patient-derived intestinal organoids.\n\nMethodsHuman intestinal organoids were constructed in a three-dimensional intestinal crypt culture of enteroscopic biopsy samples from control subjects and patients with CD. The epithelial regeneration ability of intestinal organoids was assessed using organoid reconstitution, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), and wound healing assays.\n\nResultsEx vivo cultures of ileal crypt cells revealed that organoid formation rate of CD patients were reduced compared with that of control subjects (p <.001). CD patient-derived organoids sub-cultured for more than 6 passages showed stable organoid reconstitution and identical morphological features. The organoid constitution and MTT assay revealed that the viability of TNF-treated CD patient-derived organoids were significantly lower than that of TNF-treated control organoids (p <.05 for each). The number of EdU+ proliferative cells was significantly lower in TNF-treated CD patient-derived organoids than in TNF-treated control organoids (p <.05). The wound-healing ability of TNF-treated CD patient-derived organoids was significantly lower than that of TNF-treated control organoids (p <.001).\n\nConclusionsThe clinical trials are disabled to settle this issue, our results indicated that the epithelial regenerative ability is impaired in patients with CD, especially in TNF-enriched condition.",

    "abstract": "Photoswitchable reagents to modulate microtubule stability and dynamics are an exciting tool approach towards micron- and millisecond-scale control over endogenous cytoskeleton-dependent processes. When these reagents are globally administered yet locally photoactivated in 2D cell culture, they can exert precise biological control that would have great potential for in vivo translation across a variety of research fields and for all eukaryotes. However, photopharmacologys reliance on the azobenzene photoswitch scaffold has been accompanied by a failure to translate this temporally- and cellularly-resolved control to 3D models or to in vivo applications in multi-organ animals, which we attribute substantially to the metabolic liabilities of azobenzenes.\n\nHere, we optimised the potency and solubility of metabolically stable, druglike colchicinoid microtubule inhibitors based instead on the styrylbenzothiazole (SBT) photoswitch scaffold, that are non-responsive to the major fluorescent protein imaging channels and so enable multiplexed imaging studies. We applied these reagents to 3D systems (organoids, tissue explants) and classic model organisms (zebrafish, clawed frog) with one- and two-protein imaging experiments. We successfully used systemic treatment plus spatiotemporally-localised illuminations in vivo to photocontrol microtubule dynamics, network architecture, and microtubule-dependent processes in these systems with cellular precision and second-level resolution. These nanomolar, in vivo-capable photoswitchable reagents can prove a game-changer for high-precision cytoskeleton research in cargo transport, cell motility, cell division and development. More broadly, their straightforward design can also inspire the development of similarly capable optical reagents for a range of protein targets, so bringing general in vivo photopharmacology one step closer to productive realisation.",

    "abstract": "Plasma membrane damage (PMD) occurs in all cell types due to environmental perturbation and cell-autonomous activities. However, cellular outcomes of PMD remain largely unknown except for recovery or death. Here, using budding yeast and normal human fibroblasts, we show that cellular senescence, irreversible cell cycle arrest contributing to organismal aging, is the long-term outcome of PMD. To identify the genes essential for PMD response, we developed a simple PMD-damaging assay using a detergent and performed a systematic yeast genome-wide screen. The screen identified 48 genes. The top hits in the screen are the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) genes, encoding the well-described plasma membrane repair proteins in eukaryotes. Unexpectedly, the replicative lifespan regulator genes are enriched in our 48 hits. This finding suggests a close genetic association between the PMD response and the replicative lifespan regulations. Indeed, we show that PMD limits the replicative lifespan in budding yeast; the ESCRT activator AAA-ATPase VPS4-overexpression extends it. These results suggest that PMD limits replicative lifespan in budding yeast. Moreover, in normal human fibroblasts, we find that PMD induces premature senescence via the Ca2+-p53 axis but not the major senescence pathway, ATM/ATR pathway. Consistent with the results in yeast, transient overexpression of ESCRT-III, CHMP4B, suppressed the PMD-dependent senescence in normal human fibroblasts. Our study proposes that PMD limits cellular lifespan in two different eukaryotic cell types and highlights an underappreciated but ubiquitous senescent cell subtype, namely PMD-dependent senescent cells.",

Given the diversity of microbes within hosts, higher-order interactions among more than two microbial species may also impact disease. To test this hypothesis, we performed inoculation experiments that investigated interactions among two fungal parasites, Rhizoctonia solani and Colletotrichum cereale, and a systemic fungal endophyte, Epichloe coenophiala, within a grass host. Both pairwise and higher-order interactions impacted disease progression. While the endophyte did not directly influence R. solani growth or C. cereale symptom development, the endophyte modified the interaction between the two parasites. The magnitude of the facilitative effect of C. cereale on the growth of R. solani tended to be greater when the endophyte was present. Moreover, this interaction modification strongly affected leaf mortality. For plants lacking the endophyte, parasite co-inoculation did not increase leaf mortality compared to single-parasite inoculations. In contrast, for endophyte-infected plants, parasite co-inoculation increased leaf mortality compared to inoculation with R. solani or C. cereale alone by 1.9 or 4.9 times, respectively. Together, these results show that disease progression can be strongly impacted by higher-order interactions among microbial symbionts.",

    "abstract": "Mutation of the gene PARK7 (DJ1) causes monogenic autosomal recessive Parkinsons disease (PD) in humans. Subsequent alterations of PARK7 protein function lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, a major element in PD pathology. Homozygous mutants for the PARK7-orthologous genes in zebrafish, park7, show changes to gene expression in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, supporting that disruption of energy production is a key feature of neurodegeneration in PD. Iron is critical for normal mitochondrial function, and we have previously used bioinformatic analysis of IRE-bearing transcripts in brain transcriptomes to find evidence supporting the existence of iron dyshomeostasis in Alzheimers disease. Here, we analysed IRE-bearing transcripts in the transcriptome data from homozygous park7-/- mutant zebrafish brains. We found that the set of genes with \"high quality\" IREs in their 5 untranslated regions (UTRs, the HQ5IRE gene set) was significantly altered in these 4-month-old park7-/- brains.

    "abstract": "Rational decision makers aim to maximize their gains, but humans and other animals often fail to do so, exhibiting biases and distortions in their choice behavior. In a recent study of economic decisions, humans, mice, and rats have been reported to succumb to the sunk cost fallacy, making decisions based on irrecoverable past investments in detriment of expected future returns. We challenge this interpretation because it is subject to a statistical fallacy, a form of attrition bias, and the observed behavior can be explained without invoking a sunk cost-dependent mechanism. Using a computational model, we illustrate how a rational decision maker with a reward-maximizing decision strategy reproduces the reported behavioral pattern and propose an improved task design to dissociate sunk costs from fluctuations in decision valuation. Similar statistical confounds may be common in analyses of cognitive behaviors, highlighting the need to use causal statistical inference and generative models for interpretation.",

Identifying this multiscale organisation can yield insight into the underlying biological mechanisms at play. To date, however, this identification requires a priori biological knowledge of the system under study. Here, we recover the temporal organisation of the cell cycle of budding yeast into phases and subphases, in an automated way. To do so, we model the cell cycle as a partially temporal network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) by combining a traditional static PPI network with protein concentration or RNA expression time series data. Then, we cluster the snapshots of this temporal network to infer phases, which show good agreement with our biological knowledge of the cell cycle. We systematically test the robustness of the approach and investigate the effect of having only partial temporal information. Our results show for the first time that a temporal network with only partial temporal information, i.e. for some of the PPIs, is sufficient to infer the temporal organization of a system. The generality of the method makes it suitable for application to other, less well-known biological systems for which the temporal organisation of processes plays an important role.",

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the observed sex differences in influenza virus infection remains poorly understood. In this study, we used a network-based approach to characterize the blood transcriptome collected over the course of infection with influenza A virus from female and male ferrets to dissect sex-biased gene expression. We identified significant differences in the temporal dynamics and regulation of immune responses between females and males. Our results elucidate sex-differentiated pathways involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), lipid metabolism, and inflammatory responses, including a female-biased IRE1/XBP1 activation and male-biased crosstalk between metabolic reprogramming and IL-1 and AP-1 pathways. Overall, our study provides molecular insights into sex differences in transcriptional regulation of immune responses and contributes to a better understanding of sex bias in influenza pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The translocon SecYEG forms the primary protein-conducting channel in the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria, and the associated ATPase SecA provides the energy for the transport of secretory and cell envelope protein precursors. The translocation requires negative charge at the lipid membrane surface, but its dependence on the properties of the membrane hydrophobic core is not known. Here, we demonstrate that SecA:SecYEG-mediated protein transport is immensely stimulated by unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). Furthermore, UFA-rich tetraoleoyl-cardiolipin, but not bis(palmitoyloleoyl)-cardiolipin, facilitate the translocation via the monomeric translocon. Biophysical analysis and molecular dynamics simulations show that UFAs determine the loosely packed membrane interface, where the N-terminal amphipathic helix of SecA docks. While UFAs do not affect the translocon folding, they promote SecA binding to the membrane, and the effect is enhanced manifold at elevated ionic strength. Tight SecA:lipid interactions convert into the augmented translocation. As bacterial cells actively change their membrane composition in response to their habitat, the modulation of SecA:SecYEG activity via the fatty acids may be crucial for protein secretion over a broad range of environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Whole-cell screening for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) inhibitors is complicated by the pathogens slow growth and biocontainment requirements. Here we present a synthetic biology framework for assaying Mtb drug targets in engineered E. coli. We construct Target Essential Surrogate E. coli (TESEC) in which an essential metabolic enzyme is deleted and replaced with an Mtb-derived functional analog, linking bacterial growth to the activity of the target enzyme. High throughput screening of a TESEC model for Mtb alanine racemase (ALR) revealed benazepril as a targeted inhibitor. In vitro biochemical assays indicated a noncompetitive mechanism unlike that of clinical ALR inhibitors. This is the first report of an antimicrobial activity in an approved Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and may explain clinical data associating use of ACE inhibitors with reduced Mtb infection risk. We establish the scalability of TESEC for drug discovery by characterizing TESEC strains for four additional targets.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe challenge of discovering new antibiotics is both scientific and economic. No simple test can determine if a given molecule will be safe and effective in real human patients. Many drug candidates must therefore be advanced for each new antibiotic that reaches the market - a risky and expensive process.\n\nIn this work we use synthetic biology to engineer the common laboratory model bacterium E. coli as a tool for early stage antibiotic discovery. As a proof of concept we expressed a known tuberculosis drug target and found a novel inhibitor: benazepril.\n\nMany other drug targets could be screened similarly using the system that we describe. Because E. coli can be grown safely and cheaply, this approach may help to reduce costs and make drug discovery more accessible.",

    "abstract": "Multiple receptors have been implicated in lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) uptake, yet each receptor only partially accounts for the uptake, and no endocytic pathway has been described for Lp(a) internalisation to date. In this study, we define macropinocytosis as the endocytic pathway responsible for internalising Lp(a). In liver and macrophage cells, Lp(a) uptake was dependent on extracellular calcium and inhibited by amiloride or its derivative EIPA (5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-Amiloride). Uptake of the unique protein component of Lp(a), apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) alone was also dependent on macropinocytosis, indicating that it is the likely mediator of Lp(a) uptake. In macrophages, the tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) citalopram, fluoxetine and sertraline all inhibited Lp(a) uptake, likely due to macrophage de-differentiation effects and dynamin inhibition (in the case of sertraline). In liver cells, imipramine and citalopram strongly stimulated Lp(a) uptake, while sertraline inhibited uptake. Imipramine and citalopram enhanced cell surface binding of Lp(a) rather than upregulating macropinocytosis per se, indicating that immobilisation on the plasma membrane is an important step in Lp(a) macropinocytosis. Serotonin treatment also increased Lp(a) cell surface binding, promoting subsequent macropinocytotic uptake, consistent with imipramine and citalopram boosting extracellular serotonin levels through serotonin transporter inhibition. Imipramine and citalopram increased Lp(a) delivery to Rab11-positive recycling endosomes which promoted recycling of the apo(a) component of Lp(a) into the culture media. These findings support the utility of imipramine and citalopram as promising Lp(a)-lowering therapeutics in people suffering from depression who often have elevated Lp(a) levels and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nSummaryElevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) levels have been found in individuals suffering from depression posing an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Efforts to effectively reduce circulating Lp(a) levels have been limited due to an inability to ascribe a clear cellular uptake pathway, despite multiple receptors being implicated in Lp(a) uptake. We report here that Lp(a) uptake is mediated by the fluid-phase endocytic process, macropinocytosis. Furthermore, serotonin and commonly prescribed antidepressants promote Lp(a) uptake by macropinocytosis in liver cells by increasing cell surface association. These findings represent a major paradigm shift in Lp(a) biology since previous studies have attributed Lp(a) uptake to receptor-mediated endocytosis. They also imply that treatment with antidepressants may improve cardiovascular as well as mental health.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial dysfunction is associated with multiple vascular diseases and lacks effective treatments. Activated Protein C (aPC) is a promising biotherapeutic that signals via protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) to promote diverse cytoprotective responses, including endothelial barrier stabilization, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities, which is facilitated by co-receptors. We showed that aPC-activated PAR1 signals preferentially via {beta}-arrestin-2 ({beta}-arr2) and dishevelled-2 (Dvl2) scaffolds rather than G proteins to enhance barrier protection. However, the mechanisms by which aPC/PAR1 promotes other cytoprotective responses are poorly understood. Here we define a novel {beta}-arr2-mediated sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1)-sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1)-Akt signaling axis that confers aPC/PAR1-mediated protection against cell death. We show that PAR1 and S1PR1 co-exist in caveolin-1-rich microdomains basally and aPC markedly increases S1PR1-caveolin-1 co-association. Moreover, aPC stimulates {beta}-arr2-dependent SphK1 activation independent of Dvl2, which is critical for S1PR1 transactivation. These studies reveal that different aPC/PAR1 cytoprotective responses are mediated by discrete {beta}-arr2-driven signaling pathways in caveolae.",

Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are vectors that can be used for transfecting nucleic acids as well as many other compounds. CPPs associate nucleic acids non-covalently, forming stable nanoparticles and providing efficient transfection of cells in vitro. However, in vivo, expected efficiency is achieved only in rare cases. One of the reasons for this discrepancy is formation of protein corona around nanoparticles, once they are exposed to a biological environment, e.g. blood stream. In this study, we compared CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles formed in the presence of bovine, murine and human serum. We used Western blot and mass-spectrometry to identify the major constituents of protein corona forming around nanoparticles, showing that proteins involved in transport, haemostasis and complement system are its major components. We investigated physical features of nanoparticles, and measured their biological efficiency in splice-correction assay. We showed that protein corona constituents might alter the fate of nanoparticles in vivo, e.g. by subjecting them to phagocytosis. We demonstrated that composition of protein corona of nanoparticles is species-specific that leads to dissimilar transfection efficiency and should be taken into account while developing delivery systems for nucleic acids.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) equips breast cancer cells for metastasis and treatment resistance. Inhibition and elimination of EMT-undergoing cells are therefore promising therapy approaches. However, detecting EMT-undergoing cells is challenging due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of cancer cells and the phenotypic diversity of EMT programs. Here, we profiled EMT transition phenotypes in four non-cancerous human mammary epithelial cell lines using a FACS surface marker screen, RNA sequencing, and mass cytometry. EMT was induced in the HMLE and MCF10A cell lines and in the HMLE-Twist-ER and HMLE-Snail-ER cell lines by chronic exposure to TGF{beta}1 or 4-hydroxytamoxifen, respectively. We observed a spectrum of EMT transition phenotypes in each cell line and the spectrum varied across the time course. Our data provide multiparametric insights at single-cell level into the phenotypic diversity of EMT at different time points and in four human cellular models. These insights are valuable to better understand the complexity of EMT, to compare EMT transitions between the cellular models used herein, and for the design of EMT time course experiments.\n\n\n\nO_TBL View this table:\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10d2b87org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a4cc67org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@67bc95org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8df40dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1919e7c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL C_TBL Mendeley Data: DOI: 10.17632/pt3gmyk5r2.1\n\nArrayExpress Data: Accession number E-MTAB-9365",

Previous in vitro cell culture studies suggest that RHOA can regulate many critical aspects of vascular endothelial cell (EC) biology, including focal adhesion, stress fiber formation, and angiogenesis. However, the specific in vivo roles of RHOA during vascular development and homeostasis are still not well understood.\n\nObjectiveIn this study we examine the in vivo functions of RHOA in regulating vascular development and integrity in zebrafish.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe use zebrafish RHOA-ortholog (rhoaa) mutants, transgenic embryos expressing wild type, dominant-negative, or constitutively active forms of rhoaa in ECs, and a pharmacologic inhibitor of ROCK1/2 to study the in vivo consequences of RHOA gain- and loss-of-function in the vascular endothelium. Our findings document roles for RHOA in vascular integrity, developmental angiogenesis, and vascular morphogenesis.\n\nConclusionsOur results indicate that either too much or too little RHOA activity leads to vascular dysfunction in vivo.",

    "abstract": "White adipose tissue hyperplasia has been shown to be crucial for handling excess energy in healthy ways. Though adipogenesis mechanisms have been underscored in vitro, we lack information on how tissue and systemic factors influence the differentiation of new adipocytes. While this could be studied in zebrafish, adipocyte identification currently relies on neutral lipid labeling, thus precluding access to cells in early stages of differentiation. Here we report the generation and analysis of a zebrafish line with the transgene fabp4(-2.7):EGFPcaax. In vivo confocal microscopy of the pancreatic and abdominal visceral depots of transgenic larvae, revealed the presence of labeled mature adipocytes as well as immature cells in earlier stages of differentiation. Through co-labeling for blood vessels, we observed a close interaction of differentiating adipocytes with endothelial cells through cell protrusions. Finally, we implemented hyperspectral imaging and spectral phasor analysis in Nile Red labeled transgenic larvae and revealed the lipid metabolic transition towards neutral lipid accumulation of differentiating adipocytes. Altogether our work presents the characterization of a novel adipocyte-specific label in zebrafish and uncovers previously unknown aspects of in vivo adipogenesis.\n\nSummary statementAnalysis of the differentiation of adipocytes in vivo through cell-specific labeling in zebrafish, revealed their early interaction with blood vessels as well as early lipid metabolic changes.",

    "abstract": "Reversible protein phosphorylation by kinases in extensively used to control a plethora of processes essential for proper development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. One main obstacle in studying the role of a defined kinase-substrate interaction is that kinases form complex signaling networks and most often phosphorylate multiple substrates involved in various cellular processes. In recent years, several new approaches have been developed to control the activity of a given kinase. However, most of them fail to regulate a single protein target, likely hiding the effect of a unique kinase-substrate by pleiotropic effects. To overcome this limitation, we have created protein binder-based engineered kinases for direct, robust and tissue-specific phosphorylation of target fluorescent protein fusions in vivo. We show that synthetic Rok kinases, based on the Drosophila ortholog of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), are functional enzymes and can activate myosin II through phosphorylation of Sqh::GFP or Sqh::mCherry in different morphogenetic processes in a developing fly embryo. We next use the system to study the impact of actomyosin activation specifically in the developing tracheal branches and showed that ectopic activation of actomyosin with engineered Rok kinase did not prevent cell intercalation nor the formation of autocellular junctions. We assume that this approach can be adapted to other kinases and targets in various eukaryotic genetic systems.",

Materials based on co-electrospun oriented hollow cylinders have been introduced to provide validation for such methods. This study extends this work, exploring accuracy and repeatability using an extended acquisition on a 300 mT/m gradient human MRI scanner, in substrates closely mimicking tissue, i.e., non-circular cross-sections, intra-voxel fibre crossing, intra-voxel distributions of pore-sizes and smaller pore-sizes overall.\n\nMethodsIn a single-blind experiment, diffusion-weighted data were collected from a biomimetic phantom on a 3T Connectom system using multiple gradient directions/diffusion times. Repeated scans established short-term and long-term repeatability. The total scan time (54 minutes) matched similar protocols used in human studies. The number of distinct fibre populations was estimated using spherical deconvolution, and median pore size estimated through the combination of CHARMED and AxCaliber3D framework. Diffusion-based estimates were compared with measurements derived from scanning electron microscopy.\n\nResultsThe phantom contained substrates with different orientations, fibre configurations and pore size distributions. Irrespective of one or two populations within the voxel, the pore-size estimates (~5m) and orientation-estimates showed excellent agreement with the median values of pore-size derived from scanning electron microscope and phantom configuration. Measurement repeatability depended on substrate complexity, with lower values seen in samples containing crossing-fibres. Sample-level repeatability was found to be good.\n\nConclusionWhile no phantom mimics tissue completely, this study takes a step closer to validating diffusion microstructure measurements for use in vivo by demonstrating the ability to quantify microgeometry in relatively complex configurations.",

The core polymerase exists in at least three catalytically distinct conformations, one being kinetically consistent with incorporation of incorrect nucleotides. We provide the first evidence that an RdRp uses a thermal ratchet instead of a power stroke to transition from the pre- to post-translocated state.

The simple aqueous conditions typically studied in the lab differ strongly from those found in these environments and often exclude the effects of small volume confinement or the influence that external fields have on their motion. In this work, we investigate magnetically steerable microswimmers, specifically magnetotactic bacteria, in strong spatial confinement and under the influence of an external magnetic field. We trap single cells in micrometer-sized microfluidic chambers and track and analyze their motion, which shows a variety of different trajectories, depending on the chamber size and the strength of the magnetic field. Combining these experimental observations with simulations using a variant of an active Brownian particle model, we explain the variety of trajectories by the interplay between the wall interactions and the magnetic torque. We also analyze the pronounced cell-to-cell heterogeneity, which makes single-cell tracking essential for an understanding of the motility patterns. In this way, our work establishes a basis for the analysis and prediction of microswimmer motility in more complex environments.",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent availability of vaccines against the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the search for inhibitory therapeutic agents has assumed importance especially in the context of emerging new viral variants. In this paper, we describe the discovery of a novel non-covalent small-molecule inhibitor, MCULE-5948770040, that binds to and inhibits the SARS-Cov-2 main protease (Mpro) by employing a scalable high throughput virtual screening (HTVS) framework and a targeted compound library of over 6.5 million molecules that could be readily ordered and purchased. Our HTVS framework leverages the U.S. supercomputing infrastructure achieving nearly 91% resource utilization and nearly 126 million docking calculations per hour. Downstream biochemical assays validate this Mpro inhibitor with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 2.9 {micro}M [95% CI 2.2, 4.0]. Further, using room-temperature X-ray crystallography, we show that MCULE-5948770040 binds to a cleft in the primary binding site of Mpro forming stable hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions. We then used multiple {micro}s-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and machine learning (ML) techniques to elucidate how the bound ligand alters the conformational states accessed by Mpro, involving motions both proximal and distal to the binding site. Together, our results demonstrate how MCULE-5948770040 inhibits Mpro and offers a springboard for further therapeutic design.\n\nO_TEXTBOXSignificance StatementThe ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has prompted a global race towards finding effective therapeutics that can target the various viral proteins. Despite many virtual screening campaigns in development, the discovery of validated inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 protein targets has been limited. We discover a novel inhibitor against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Our integrated platform applies downstream biochemical assays, X-ray crystallography, and atomistic simulations to obtain a comprehensive characterization of its inhibitory mechanism. Inhibiting Mpro can lead to significant biomedical advances in targeting SARS-CoV-2 treatment, as it plays a crucial role in viral replication.\n\nC_TEXTBOX",

    "abstract": "Shaping functional structures during embryonic development requires both genetic and physical control. During somitogenesis, cell-cell coordination sets up genetic traveling waves in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) that orchestrate somite formation. While key molecular and genetic aspects of this process are known, the mechanical events required to physically segment somites from the PSM remain unclear. Combining direct mechanical measurements during somite formation, live imaging of cell and tissue structure, and computer simulations, here we show that somites are mechanically sectioned off from the PSM by a large, actomyosin-driven increase in anisotropic stress at the nascent somite-somite boundary. Our results show that this localized increase in stress drives the regional fluidization of the tissue adjacent to the forming somite border, enabling local tissue remodeling and the shaping of the somite. Moreover, we find that active tension fluctuations in the tissue are optimized to mechanically define sharp somite boundaries while minimizing somite morphological defects. Altogether, these results indicate that mechanical changes at the somite-somite border and optimal tension fluctuations in the tissue are essential physical aspects of somite formation.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of cell cycle components results in the development and progression of several cancer types. Unusually, loss of the tumour suppressor gene, Retinoblastoma (Rb), and consequent activation of transcription factor E2F1 have been linked to late-stage tumour progression in prostate cancer, rather than early-stage events. This change is associated with an androgen-independent form of cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which frequently still requires androgen receptor (AR) signalling. We have previously shown that binucleate secondary cells (SCs) of the Drosophila melanogaster male accessory gland (AG) share several functional and signalling similarities with human prostate epithelial cells. Upon mating, SC growth regulation switches from a steroid-dependent to a steroid-independent form of Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) control that induces genome endoreplication. Here, we demonstrate that the Drosophila Rb homologue, Rbf, and E2F1, as well as cell cycle regulators, Cyclin D (CycD) and Cyclin E (CycE), are key mediators of SC growth and endoreplication both in virgin and mated males. Importantly, we show that the CycD/Rbf/E2F1 axis requires the EcR, but not ecdysone, to trigger CycE-dependent endoreplication and associated growth in SCs after mating, mirroring changes in CRPC. We also demonstrate that excess Rbf activity reversibly suppresses binucleation in adult SCs. Overall, our work reveals mechanistic parallels between the physiological switch to hormone-independent EcR signalling in SCs, and the pathological switch seen in CRPC, and suggests that the latter may represent the dysregulation of a currently unidentified physiological process, which permits AR signalling when androgen levels are low.",

Initial expansion of the progenitor cell pool is followed by the generation of neurons of all the cortical layers and later, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. However, the regulatory pathways that control the expansion and maintenance of the neuroepithelial progenitor cell pool are currently unknown. Here we define six basic pathway components that regulate proliferation of cortically specified human neuroepithelial stem cells (cNESCs) in vitro without the loss of developmental potential. We show that activation of FGF and inhibition of BMP and ACTIVIN A signalling are required for long-term cNESC proliferation. We also demonstrate that cNESCs preserve dorsal telencephalon-specific potential when GSK3, AKT and nuclear CATENIN-{beta}1 activity are low. Remarkably, regulation of these six pathway components supports the clonal expansion of cNESCs. Moreover, cNESCs differentiate to lower and upper layer cortical neurons both in vitro and in vivo. Identifying the mechanisms that drive the self-renewal and fate of cNESCs decision of neuroepithelial stem cells is key to developing new stem cell-based therapeutic approaches to treat neurological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Sub-nuclear compartmentalization has been proposed to play an important role in gene regulation by segregating active and inactive parts of the genome in distinct physical and biochemical environments, where transcription and epigenetic factors are either concentrated or depleted. The inactive X chromosome offers a paradigm for studying sub-nuclear compartmentalization. When the non-coding Xist RNA coats the X chromosome, it recruits repressors and chromatin factors that trigger gene silencing, and forms a dense body of heterochromatin from which the transcription machinery appears to be excluded. Phase separation has been proposed to be involved in X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) and might explain exclusion of the transcription machinery by preventing its diffusion into the Xist-coated territory. Here, using quantitative fluorescence microscopy and single particle tracking, we show that RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) freely accesses the Xist territory during initiation of XCI, and that its diffusion is not prevented by biophysical constraints. Instead, the apparent depletion of RNAPII is due to the loss of its chromatin bound fraction. These findings demonstrate that initial exclusion of RNA Pol2 from the inactive X is a consequence of its reduced binding rate at the chromatin and gene level, rather than the biophysical compartmentalization of the inactive X heterochromatin domain. The Xist silent compartment is thus a biochemical rather than a biophysical compartment, at least during initiation of XCI.",

    "abstract": "Structural variants (SVs) can be important drivers of human adaptation with strong effects, but previous studies have focused primarily on common variants with weak effects. Here, we used large-scale single-molecule long-read sequencing of 320 Tibetan and Han samples, to show that SVs are key drivers of selection under high-altitude adaptation. We expand the landscape of global SVs, apply robust models of selection and population differentiation combining SVs, SNPs and InDels, and use epigenomic analyses to predict driver enhancers, target genes, upstream regulators, and biological functions, which we validate using enhancer reporter and DNA pull-down assays. We reveal diverse Tibetan-specific SVs affecting the cis- and trans-regulatory circuitry of diverse biological functions, including hypoxia response, energy metabolism, lung function, etc. Our study greatly expands the global SV landscape, reveals the central role of gene-regulatory circuitry rewiring in human adaptation, and illustrates the diverse functional roles that SVs can play in human biology.",

    "abstract": "Insights from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), as well as recordings of large numbers of neurons, reveal that many cognitive, emotional, and motor functions depend on the multivariate interactions of brain signals. To decode brain dynamics, we propose an architecture based on recurrent neural networks to uncover distributed spatiotemporal signatures. We demonstrate the potential of the approach using human fMRI data during movie-watching data and a continuous experimental paradigm. The model was able to learn spatiotemporal patterns that supported 15-way movie-clip classification (~90%) at the level of brain regions, and binary classification of experimental conditions (~60%) at the level of voxels. The model was also able to learn individual differences in measures of fluid intelligence and verbal IQ at levels comparable or better than existing techniques. We propose a dimensionality reduction approach that uncovers low-dimensional trajectories and captures essential informational (i.e., classification related) properties of brain dynamics. Finally, saliency maps were employed to characterize brain-region/voxel importance, and uncovered how dynamic but consistent changes in fMRI activation influenced decoding performance. When applied at the level of voxels, our framework implements a dynamic version of multivariate pattern analysis. We believe our approach provides a powerful framework for visualizing, analyzing, and discovering dynamic spatially distributed brain representations during naturalistic conditions.1\n\nAuthor summaryBrain signals are inherently dynamic and evolve in both space and time as a function of cognitive or emotional task condition or mental state. To characterize brain dynamics, we employed an architecture based on recurrent neural networks, and applied it to functional magnetic resonance imaging data from humans watching movies or during continuous experimental conditions. The model learned spatiotemporal patterns that allowed it to correctly classify which clip a participant was watching based entirely on data from other participants; the model also learned a binary classification of experimental conditions at the level of voxels. We developed a dimensionality reduction approach that uncovered low-dimensional \"trajectories\" and captured essential information properties of brain dynamics. When applied at the level of voxels, our framework implements a dynamic version of multivariate pattern analysis. We believe our approach provides a powerful framework for visualizing, analyzing, and discovering dynamic spatially distributed brain representations during naturalistic conditions.",

    "abstract": "While multiple monoamines modulate cerebellar output, the mechanistic details of dopaminergic signaling in the cerebellum remain poorly understood. Here we show that Drd1 dopamine receptors are expressed in unipolar brush cells (UBCs) of the cerebellar vermis. Drd1 activation increases UBC firing rate and postsynaptic NMDA receptor-mediated currents. Using anatomical tracing and in situ hybridization, we tested three hypotheses about the source of cerebellar dopamine. We exclude midbrain dopaminergic nuclei and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive Purkinje cells as potential sources, supporting the possibility of dopaminergic co-release from locus coeruleus (LC) axons. Using an optical dopamine sensor GRABDA, electrical stimulation, and optogenetic activation of LC fibers in the acute slice, we find evidence for monoamine release onto Drd1-expressing UBCs. Altogether, we propose that the LC regulates cerebellar cortex activity by co-releasing dopamine onto UBCs to modulate their response to cerebellar inputs. Purkinje neurons directly inhibit these Drd1-positive UBCs, forming a dopamine-sensitive recurrent vestibulo-cerebellar circuit.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in the neuroscience of everyday communication is how scene acoustics shape the neural processing of attended speech sounds and in turn impact speech intelligibility. While it is well known that the temporal envelopes in target speech are important for intelligibility, how the neural encoding of target-speech envelopes is influenced by background sounds or other acoustic features of the scene is unknown. Here, we combine human electroencephalography with simultaneous intelligibility measurements to address this key gap. We find that the neural envelope-domain signal-to-noise ratio in target-speech encoding, which is shaped by masker modulations, predicts intelligibility over a range of strategically chosen realistic listening conditions unseen by the predictive model. This provides neurophysiological evidence for modulation masking. Moreover, using high-resolution vocoding to carefully control peripheral envelopes, we show that target-envelope coding fidelity in the brain depends not only on envelopes conveyed by the cochlea, but also on the temporal fine structure (TFS), which supports scene segregation. Our results are consistent with the notion that temporal coherence of sound elements across envelopes and/or TFS influences scene analysis and attentive selection of a target sound. Our findings also inform speech-intelligibility models and technologies attempting to improve real-world speech communication.",
