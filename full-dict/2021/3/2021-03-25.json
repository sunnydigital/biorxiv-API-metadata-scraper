    "abstract": "Speckle based methods are popular non-invasive, label-free full-field optical techniques for imaging blood flow maps at single vessel resolution with a high temporal resolution. However, conventional speckle approach cannot provide an absolute velocity map with magnitude and direction. Here, we report a novel optical speckle image velocimetry (OSIV) technique for measuring the quantitative blood flow vector map by utilizing particle image velocimetry with speckle cross-correlations. We demonstrate that our OSIV instrument has a linearity range up to 7 mm/s, higher than conventional optical methods. Our method can measure the absolute flow vector map at up to 190 Hz without sacrificing the image size, and it eliminates the need for a high-speed camera/detector. We applied OSIV to image the blood flow in a mouse brain, and as a proof of concept, imaged the real-time dynamic changes in the cortical blood flow field during the stroke process in vivo. Our wide-field quantitative flow measurement OSIV method without the need of tracers provides a valuable tool for studying the healthy and diseased brain.",

    "abstract": "Signaling pathways that control vital features of leukemic stem cells including multipotency, self-renewal, clonal expansion and quiescence remain unclear. Emerging studies illustrate critical roles for lysosomes in hematopoietic and leukemic stem cell fate. By investigating consequences of INPP4B alterations in AML, we have discovered its role in driving leukemic  stemness. We observed that INPP4B is highly expressed leukemic stem cell populations and Inpp4b-deficeint leukemias demonstrate increased disease latency, reduced leukemia initiating potential which is associated with a differentiated leukemic phenotype. Molecular analyses show that Inpp4b-deficient leukemias have compromised lysosomal gene expression, lysosomal content, and lysosomal activity. Our discovery of a novel pathway linking INPP4B, lysosomal biogenesis and leukemic stemness, provides a mechanism to explain the association of high INPP4B expression with poor AML prognosis, and highlights novel patient stratification strategies and LSC-specific leukemic therapies.\n\nKey PointsOur findings highlight a novel pathway linking INPP4B, lysosomal function and leukemic stemness that explains the prognostic role of INPP4B in AML.\nOur data reveal the utility of INPP4B as a biomarker of aggressive AML and provide a rationale to explore INPP4B and its associated function in lysosome biology as novel strategies to target LSC and AML",

    "abstract": "Rapid advances in synthetic biology are driving the development of genetically engineered microbes as therapeutic agents for a multitude of human diseases, including cancer. In particular, the immunosuppressive microenvironment of solid tumors creates a favorable niche for systemically administered bacteria to engraft in the tumor and release therapeutic payloads. However, such payloads can be harmful if released in healthy tissues where the bacteria also engraft in smaller numbers. To address this limitation, we engineer therapeutic bacteria to be controlled by focused ultrasound, a form of energy that can be applied noninvasively to specific anatomical sites such as solid tumors. This control is provided by a temperature-actuated genetic state switch that produces lasting therapeutic output in response to briefly applied focused ultrasound hyperthermia. Using a combination of rational design and high-throughput screening we optimized the switching circuits of engineered cells and connected their activity to the release of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In a clinically relevant cancer model, ultrasound-activated therapeutic microbes successfully turned on in situ and induced a marked suppression of tumor growth. This technology provides a critical tool for the spatiotemporal targeting of potent bacterial therapeutics in a variety of biological and clinical scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Tissue growth in three-dimensional (3D) printed scaffolds enables exploration and control of cell behaviour in biologically realistic geometries. Cell proliferation and migration in these experiments have yet to be explicitly characterised, limiting the ability of experimentalists to determine the effects of various experimental conditions, such as scaffold geometry, on cell behaviour. We consider tissue growth by osteoblastic cells in melt electro-written scaffolds that comprise thin square pores with sizes that we deliberately vary. We collect highly detailed temporal measurements of the average cell density, tissue coverage, and tissue geometry. To quantify tissue growth in terms of the underlying cell proliferation and migration processes, we introduce and calibrate a mechanistic mathematical model based on the Porous-Fisher reaction-diffusion equation. Parameter estimates and uncertainty quantification through profile likelihood analysis reveal consistency in the rate of cell proliferation and steady-state cell density between pore sizes. This analysis also serves as an important model verification tool: while the use of reaction-diffusion models in biology is widespread, the appropriateness of these models to describe tissue growth in 3D scaffolds has yet to be explored. We find that the Porous-Fisher model is able to capture features relating to the cell density and tissue coverage, but is not able to capture geometric features relating to the circularity of the tissue interface. Our analysis identifies two distinct stages of tissue growth, suggests several areas for model refinement, and provides guidance for future experimental work that explores tissue growth in 3D printed scaffolds.\n\nAuthor SummaryAdvances in 3D printing technology have led to cell culture experiments that realistically capture natural biological environments. Despite the necessity of quantifying cell behaviour with parameters that can be compared between experiments, many existing mathematical models of tissue growth in these experiments neglect information relating to population size. We consider tissue growth by cells on 3D printed scaffolds that comprise square pores of various sizes in this work. We apply a relatively simple mathematical model based on the Porous-Fisher reaction-diffusion equation to interpret highly detailed measurements relating to both the cell density and the quantity of tissue deposited. We analyse the efficacy of such a model in capturing cell behaviour seen in the experiments and quantify cell behaviour in terms of parameters that carry a biologically meaningful interpretation. Our analysis identifies important areas for model refinement and provides guidance for future data-collection and experimentation that explores tissue growth in 3D printed scaffolds.",

    "abstract": "Levels of parental care critically influence the developmental environment with the capacity to impact the growth, survival, physiology, and behaviour of offspring. Plastic changes in DNA methylation have been hypothesised to modulate gene expression responses to parental environments. Moreover, these effects can be inherited and so may affect the process of adaptive evolution. In this study, using experimental evolution, we investigated how plastic changes in DNA methylation induced by the loss of parental care have evolved in a biparental insect (Nicrophorus vespilloides) using experimental evolution. We show that removal of care in a single generation is associated with changes in gene expression in stress-related pathways in 1st instar larvae. However, in larvae that have adapted to the loss of parental care after being deprived of care for 30 generations, gene expression is shifted from stress-related gene expression towards growth and brain development pathways. We found that changes in gene body methylation arose both as a direct response to the loss of parental care and stochastically as populations diverged. Overall, our results suggest that a complex interplay between transcription and DNA methylation shapes the molecular adaptation to environmental change.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have identified a melanoma-associated locus on chromosome band 7p21.1 with rs117132860 as the lead SNP, and a secondary independent signal marked by rs73069846. rs117132860 is also associated with tanning ability and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). As ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is a key environmental exposure for all three traits, we investigated the mechanisms by which this locus contributes to melanoma risk, focusing on cellular response to UVR. Fine-mapping of melanoma GWAS identified four independent sets of candidate causal variants. A GWAS region-focused Capture-C study of primary melanocytes identified physical interactions between two causal sets and the promoter of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor gene (AHR). Subsequent chromatin state annotation, eQTL, and luciferase assays identified rs117132860 as a functional variant and reinforced AHR as a likely causal gene. As AHR plays critical roles in cellular response to dioxin and UVR, we explored links between this SNP and AHR expression after both 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure. Allele-specific AHR binding to rs117132860-G was enhanced following both, consistent with predicted weakened AHR binding to the risk/poor-tanning rs117132860-A allele, and allele-preferential AHR expression driven from the protective rs117132860-G allele was observed following UVB exposure. Small deletions surrounding rs117132860 via CRISPR abrogates AHR binding, reduces melanocyte cell growth, and prolongs growth arrest following UVB exposure. These data suggest AHR is a melanoma susceptibility gene at the 7p21.1 risk locus, and rs117132860 is a functional variant within a UVB-responsive element, leading to allelic AHR expression, and altering melanocyte growth phenotypes upon exposure.",

    "abstract": "Bam35 and related betatectiviruses are tail-less bacteriophages that prey on members of the Bacillus cereus group. These temperate viruses replicate their linear genome by a protein-primed mechanism. In this work, we have identified and characterized the product of the viral ORF2 as a single-stranded DNA binding protein (hereafter B35SSB). B35SSB binds ssDNA with great preference over dsDNA or RNA in a sequence-independent, highly cooperative manner that results in a non-specific stimulation of DNA replication. We have also identified several aromatic and basic residues, involved in base-stacking and electrostatic interactions, respectively, that are required for effective protein-ssDNA interaction.\n\nAlthough SSBs are essential for DNA replication in all domains of life as well as many viruses, they are very diverse proteins. However, most SSBs share a common structural domain, named OB-fold. Protein-primed viruses could constitute an exception, as no OB-fold DNA binding protein has been reported. Based on databases searches as well as phylogenetic and structural analyses, we showed that B35SSB belongs to a novel and independent group of SSBs. This group contains proteins encoded by protein-primed viral genomes from unrelated viruses, spanning betatectiviruses and {Phi}29 and close podoviruses, and they share a conserved pattern of secondary structure. Sensitive searches and structural predictions indicate that B35SSB contains a conserved domain resembling a divergent OB-fold, which would constitute the first occurrence of an OB-fold-like domain in a protein-primed genome.\n\nHighlightsO_LIBam35 ORF 2 product encodes a viral single-stranded DNA binding protein (B35SSB).\nC_LIO_LIB35SSB binds ssDNA in a highly cooperative manner but with no sequence specificity.\nC_LIO_LIB35SSB-ssDNA binding is mediated by base-stacking and ionic interactions.\nC_LIO_LIBam35 and {Phi}29-related SSBs form a novel group of SSBs from protein-primed viruses.\nC_LIO_LIThe B35-{Phi}29 SSBs group shares a highly divergent OB-fold-like domain.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "During animal evolution, de novo emergence and modifications of pre-existing transcriptional enhancers have contributed to biological innovations, by implementing gene regulatory networks. The Drosophila melanogaster bric-a-brac (bab) complex, comprising the tandem paralogous genes bab1-2, provides a paradigm to address how enhancers contribute and co-evolve to regulate jointly or differentially duplicated genes. We previously characterized an intergenic enhancer (named LAE) governing bab2 expression in leg and antennal tissues. We show here that LAE activity also regulates bab1. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated LAE excision reveals its critical role for bab2-specific expression along the proximo-distal leg axis, likely through paralog-specific interaction with the bab2 gene promoter. Furthermore, LAE appears involved but not strictly required for bab1-2 co-expression in leg tissues. Phenotypic rescue experiments, chromatin features and a gene reporter assay reveal a large \"pleiotropic\" bab1 enhancer (termed BER) including a series of cis-regulatory elements active in the leg, antennal, wing, haltere and gonadal tissues. Phylogenomics analyses indicate that (i) bab2 originates from bab1 duplication within the Muscomorpha sublineage, (ii) LAE and bab1 promoter sequences have been evolutionarily-fixed early on within the Brachycera lineage, while (iii) BER elements have been conserved more recently among muscomorphans. Lastly, we identified conserved binding sites for transcription factors known or prone to regulate directly the paralogous bab genes in diverse developmental contexts. This work provides new insights on enhancers, particularly about their emergence, maintenance and functional diversification during evolution.\n\nAuthor summaryGene duplications and transcriptional enhancer emergence/modifications are thought having greatly contributed to phenotypic innovations during animal evolution. However, how enhancers regulate distinctly gene duplicates and are evolutionary-fixed remain largely unknown. The Drosophila bric-a-brac locus, comprising the tandemly-duplicated genes bab1-2, provides a good paradigm to address these issues. The twin bab genes are co-expressed in many tissues. In this study, genetic analyses show a partial co-regulation of both genes in the developing legs depending on tissue-specific transcription factors known to bind a single enhancer. Genome editing and gene reporter assays further show that this shared enhancer is also required for bab2-specific expression. Our results also reveal the existence of partly-redundant regulatory functions of a large pleiotropic enhancer which contributes to co-regulate the bab genes in distal leg tissues. Phylogenomics analyses indicate that the Drosophila bab locus originates from duplication of a dipteran bab1-related gene, which occurred within the Brachycera (true flies) lineage. bab enhancer and promoter sequences have been differentially-conserved among Diptera suborders. This work illuminates how transcriptional enhancers from tandem gene duplicates (i) differentially interact with distinct cognate promoters and (ii) undergo distinct evolutionary changes to diversifying their respective tissue-specific gene expression pattern.",

    "abstract": "The spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression is essential to ensure robust phenotypic outcomes. Pigmentation patterns in Drosophila are formed by the deposition of different pigments synthesized in the developing epidermis and the role of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) of melanin biosynthesis pathway-related genes is well-characterized. These CREs typically exhibit modular arrangement in the regulatory region of the gene with each enhancer regulating a specific spatiotemporal expression of the gene. However, recent studies have suggested that multiple enhancers of a number of developmental genes as well as those of yellow (involved in dark pigment synthesis) exhibit redundant activities. Here we report the redundant enhancer activities in the cis-regulatory region of another gene in the melanin biosynthesis pathway, ebony, in the developing epidermis of Drosophila melanogaster. The evidence was obtained by introducing an approximately 1 kbp deletion at the endogenous primary epidermis enhancer (priEE) by genome editing. The effect of the priEE deletion on pigmentation and on the endogenous expression pattern of a mCherry-tagged ebony allele was examined in the thoracic and abdominal segments. The expression level of ebony in the priEE-deleted strains was similar to that of the control strain, indicating the presence of redundant enhancer activities that drive the broad expression of ebony in the developing epidermis. Additionally, the priEE fragment contained a silencer that suppresses ebony expression in the dorsal midline of the abdominal tergites, which is necessary for the development of the subgenus Sophophora-specific dark pigmentation patterns along the midline. The endogenous expression pattern of ebony in the priEE-deleted strains and the reporter assay examining the autonomous activity of the priEE fragment indicated that the silencer is involved in repressing the activities of both proximal and distant enhancers. These results suggest that multiple silencers are dispensable in the regulatory system of a relatively stable taxonomic character. The prevalence of other redundant enhancers and silencers in the genome can be investigated using a similar approach.\n\nAuthor summaryGenes are expressed at the right timing and place to give rise to diverse phenotypes. The spatiotemporal regulation is usually achieved through the coordinated activities of transcription-activating and transcription-repressing proteins that bind to the DNA sequences called enhancers and silencers, respectively, located near the target gene. Most studies identified the locations of enhancers by examining the ability of the sequence fragments to regulate the expression of fused reporters. Various short enhancers have been identified using this approach. This study employed an alternative approach in which the previously identified enhancer that regulates expression of ebony (a gene involved in body color formation) was deleted in a fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, using the genome-editing technique. The knockout of this enhancer did not affect the transcription level of the gene to a large extent. This indicated the presence of transcription-activating elements with redundant functions outside the deleted enhancer. Additionally, the transcription of ebony at the midline of the abdomen, which is repressed in the normal flies, were derepressed in the enhancer-deleted flies, which indicated that the deleted enhancer fragment contained a silencer that negatively regulates multiple enhancer activities in a spatially restricted manner.",

    "abstract": "Wound healing consists of a sequence of biological processes often grouped into different stages. Interventions applied to accelerate normal wound healing must take into consideration timing with respect to wound healing stages in order to maximize treatment effectiveness. Macrophage polarization from M1 to M2 represents a transition from the inflammatory to proliferation stage of wound healing. Accelerating this transition may be an effective way to accelerate wound healing; however, it must be induced at the appropriate time. We search for an optimal spatio-temporal regime to apply wound healing treatment in a mathematical model of wound healing. In this work we show that to maximize effectiveness, treatment must not be applied too early or too late. We also show that effective spatial distribution of treatment depends on the heterogenity of the wound surface. In conclusion, this research provides a possible optimal regime of therapy that focuses on macrophage activity and a hypothesis of treatment outcome to be tested experimentally in future. Finding best regimes for treatment application is a first step towards development of intelligent algorithms of wound treatment that minimize healing time.",

    "abstract": "Neosadocus harvestmen are endemic to the Southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Although they are conspicuous and display great morphological variation, their evolutionary history and the biogeographical events underlying their diversification and distribution are still unknown. This contribution about Neosadocus includes the following: a taxonomic revision; a molecular phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear markers; an investigation of the genetic structure and species diversity in a phylogeographical framework. Our results show that Neosadocus is a monophyletic group and comprises four species: N. bufo, N. maximus, N. robustus and N. misandrus (which we did not find on fieldwork and only studied the female holotype). There is astonishing male polymorphism in N. robustus, mostly related to reproductive strategies. The following synonymies have resulted from this work: Bunoweyhia variabilis Mello-Leitao, 1935 = Neosadocus bufo (Mello-Leitao, 1926); and Bunoweyhia minor Mello-Leitao, 1935 = Neosadocus maximus (Giltay, 1928). Most divergences occurred during the Miocene, a geological epoch marked by intense orogenic and climatic events in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Intraspecific analyses indicate strong population structure, a pattern congruent with the general behavior and physiological constraints of Neotropical harvestmen.",

    "abstract": "Cementum, the tissue attaching mammal tooth roots to the periodontal ligament, grows appositionally throughout life, displaying a series of circum-annual incremental features. These have been studied for decades as a direct record of chronological lifespan. The majority of previous studies on cementum have used traditional thin-section histological methods to image and analyse increments. However, several caveats have been raised in terms of studying cementum increments in thin-sections. Firstly, the limited number of thin-sections and the two-dimensional perspective they impart provide an incomplete interpretation of cementum structure, and studies often struggle or fail to overcome complications in increment patterns that complicate or inhibit increment counting. Increments have been repeatedly shown to both split and coalesce, creating accessory increments that can bias increment counts. Secondly, identification and counting of cementum increments using human vision is subjective, and it has led to inaccurate readings in several experiments studying individuals of known age. Here, we have attempted to optimise a recently introduced imaging modality for cementum imaging; X-ray propagation-based phase-contrast imaging (PPCI). X-ray PPCI was performed for a sample of rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) lower first molars (n=10) from a laboratory population of known age. A new method for semi-automatic incrementcounting was then integrated into a purpose-built software package for studying cementum increments. Comparison with data from conventional cementochronology, based on histological examination of tissue sections, confirmed that X-ray PPCI reliably records cementum increments. Validation of the increment counting algorithm suggests that it is robust and provides accurate estimates of increment counts. In summary, we show that our new increment counting method has the potential to overcome caveats of conventional cementochronology approaches, when used to analyse 3D images provided by X-ray PPCI.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of unfolded or misfolded proteins into amyloid fibrils can cause various diseases in humans. However, the fibrils synthesized in vitro can be developed toward useful biomaterials under some physicochemical conditions. In this study, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were performed to address the mechanism of beta-sheet formation of the unfolded hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) under a high temperature and low pH. Simulations of the protonated HEWL at pH 2 and the non-protonated HEWL at pH 7 were performed at the highly elevated temperature of 450 K to accelerate the unfolding, followed by the 333 K temperature in some previous in vitro studies. The simulations showed that HEWL unfolded faster and refolded into structures with higher beta-strand contents at pH 2. The mechanism of beta-strand formation at the earlier stage of amyloidosis was addressed in terms of the radial distribution of amino acids, affected by the high protonation level at a low pH.",

    "abstract": "GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase (GNPT) catalyzes the initial step in the formation of the mannose-6-phosphate tag that labels [~]60 lysosomal proteins for transport. Mutations in GNPT cause lysosomal storage disorders such as mucolipidoses. However, the molecular mechanism of GNPT remains unclear. Mammalian GNPTs are 2{beta}2{gamma}2 hexamers in which the core catalytic - and {beta}-subunits are derived from GNPTAB. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the Drosophila melanogaster GNPTAB homolog (DmGNPTAB). Four conserved regions located far apart in the sequence fold into the catalytic domain, which exhibits structural similarity to that of the UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT). Comparison with UGGT revealed a putative donor substrate-binding site, and the functional requirements of critical residues in human GNPTAB were validated using GNPTAB-knockout cells. DmGNPTAB forms an evolutionarily conserved homodimer, and perturbing the dimer interface undermines the maturation and activity of human GNPTAB. These results provide important insights into GNPT function and related diseases.",

    "abstract": "There are, besides remdesivir, no approved antivirals for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. To aid in the search for antivirals against this virus, we explored the use of human tracheal airway epithelial cells (HtAEC) and human small airway epithelial cells (HsAEC) grown at the air/liquid interface (ALI). These cultures were infected at the apical side with one of two different SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Each virus was shown to replicate to high titers for extended periods of time (at least 8 days) and, in particular an isolate with the D614G in the spike (S) protein did so more efficiently at 35{degrees}C than 37{degrees}C. The effect of a selected panel of reference drugs that were added to the culture medium at the basolateral side of the system was explored. Remdesivir, GS-441524 (the parent nucleoside of remdesivir), EIDD-1931 (the parent nucleoside of molnupiravir) and IFN ({beta}1 and {lambda}1) all resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of viral RNA and infectious virus titers collected at the apical side. However, AT-511 (the free base form of AT-527 currently in clinical testing) failed to inhibit viral replication in these in vitro primary cell models. Together, these results provide a reference for further studies aimed at selecting SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors for further preclinical and clinical development.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing the histories of complex adaptations and identifying the evolutionary mechanisms underlying their origins are two of the primary goals of evolutionary biology. Taricha newts, which contain high concentrations of the deadly toxin tetrodotoxin (TTX) as an antipredator defense, have evolved resistance to self-intoxication, which is a complex adaptation requiring changes in six paralogs of the voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav) gene family, the physiological target of TTX. Here, we reconstruct the origins of TTX self-resistance by sequencing the entire Nav gene family in newts and related salamanders. We show that moderate TTX resistance evolved early in the salamander lineage in three of the six Nav paralogs, preceding the proposed appearance of tetrodotoxic newts by [~]100 million years. TTX-bearing newts possess additional unique substitutions across the entire Nav gene family that provide physiological TTX resistance. These substitutions coincide with signatures of positive selection and relaxed purifying selection, as well as gene conversion events, that together likely facilitated their evolution. We also identify a novel exon duplication within Nav1.4 encoding an expressed TTX-binding site. Two resistance-conferring changes within newts appear to have spread via nonallelic gene conversion: in one case, one codon was copied between paralogs, and in the second, multiple substitutions were homogenized between the duplicate exons of Nav1.4. Our results demonstrate that gene conversion can accelerate the coordinated evolution of gene families in response to a common selection pressure.",
