    "abstract": "Therapeutic success of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based therapies critically depends on immunological compatibility of the hiPSC-derived transplant. As grafted hiPSC-derived cells are often immature, we hypothesized that their immunologic properties may change due to post-grafting maturation. Subsequently, this will affect their interaction with the host immune system and may compromise graft tolerance. In the present study allogeneic and autologous cellular immunity of primary cells, therof reprogrammed hiPSC, hiPSC-derived progenitor and terminally differentiated cells was investigated in vitro by using renal cells as a model system. In contrast to allogeneic primary cells, hiPSC-derived early renal progenitors and mature renal epithelial cells were both tolerated not only by autologous but also by allogeneic T cells. These immune-privileged properties resulted from active immune-modulation and low immune visibility, which declined during the process of cell maturation. However, autologous and allogeneic natural killer (NK) cell responses were not suppressed by hiPSC-derived renal cells and efficiently changed NK cell activation status. These findings clearly show a dynamic stage-specific dependency of autologous and allogeneic T- and NK cell responses to the hiPSC-derived renal cell lineage with consequences for effective cell therapies. The study suggests that hiPSC-derived early progenitors may provide advantageous immune suppressive properties when applied in cell therapy. The data furthermore indicate a need to suppress NK cell activation in allogeneic as well as autologous settings.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules are dynamic polymers consisting of {beta}-tubulin heterodimers. The initial polymerization process, called microtubule nucleation, occurs spontaneously via {beta}-tubulin. Since a large energy barrier prevents microtubule nucleation in cells, the {gamma}-tubulin ring complex is recruited to the centrosome to overcome the nucleation barrier. However, detachment of a considerable number of microtubules from the centrosome is known to contribute to fundamental processes in cells. Here, we present evidence that minus-end-binding calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 2 (CAMSAP2) serves as a strong nucleator for microtubule formation from soluble {beta}-tubulin independent of {gamma}-tubulin. CAMSAP2 significantly reduces the nucleation barrier close to the critical concentration for microtubule polymerization by stabilizing the longitudinal contacts among {beta}-tubulins. CAMSAP2 clusters together with {beta}-tubulin to generate nucleation intermediates, from which numerous microtubules radiate, forming aster-like structures. Our findings suggest that CAMSAP2 supports microtubule growth by organizing a nucleation centre as well as by stabilizing microtubule nucleation intermediates.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules establish the directionality of intracellular transport by kinesins and dynein through their polarized assembly, but it remains unclear how directed transport occurs along microtubules organized with mixed polarity. We investigated the ability of the plus-end directed kinesin-4 motor KIF21B to navigate mixed polarity microtubules in mammalian dendrites. Reconstitution assays with recombinant KIF21B and engineered microtubule bundles or extracted neuronal cytoskeletons indicate that nucleotide- independent microtubule binding regions of KIF21B modulate microtubule dynamics and promote directional switching on antiparallel microtubules. Optogenetic recruitment of KIF21B to organelles in live neurons resulted in unidirectional transport in axons but bi-directional transport with a net retrograde bias in dendrites; microtubule dynamics and the secondary microtubule binding regions are required for this net directional bias. We propose a model in which cargo-bound KIF21B motors coordinate nucleotide- sensitive and insensitive microtubule binding sites to achieve net retrograde movement along the dynamic mixed polarity microtubule arrays of dendrites.",

To investigate whether activation of BMP signaling is sufficient and necessary to induce osteoarthritis, we have used conditional GOF and LOF mouse lines in which BMP signaling can be activated or depleted, respectively, upon intra-peritoneal injection of tamoxifen. Finally, we locally inhibited BMP signaling through intra-articular injection of LDN-193189 pre- and post-onset surgically induced OA. Most of the analysis has been done through immunohistochemistry, histopathological staining, and micro-CT to evaluate the status of the pathogenesis of the disease.\n\nResultsWe observed concomitant activation of BMP signaling, as judged by pSMAD1/5/9 immunoreactivity in the articular cartilage, upon induction of osteoarthritis with simultaneous depletion of SMURF1, an intra-cellular BMP signaling inhibitor in articular cartilage. Even without surgical induction of osteoarthritis, only BMP gain-of-function mutation induces OA in mouse articular cartilage. Also, genetic, or pharmacological inhibition of BMP signaling offered significant protection against OA pathogenesis. Interestingly, post-onset of the disease, inhibition of BMP signaling by intra-articular injection of LDN-193189 retarded OA progression with a significant reduction in inflammatory markers.\n\nConclusionOur study demonstrated that BMP signaling plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of OA and that local BMP inhibition can be an effective therapeutic strategy to mitigate osteoarthritis.",

    "abstract": "Molecular gut content analysis is a popular tool to study food web interactions and was recently also suggested as an alternative source for DNA based biomonitoring. However, the overabundant consumers DNA often outcompetes that of its diet during PCR. Blocking approaches are an efficient means to reduce consumer amplification while retaining broad specificity for dietary taxa. We here designed an assay to monitor the eukaryotic diet of mussels and test their utility as biological eDNA filters to monitor planktonic communities. We designed several rDNA primer sets with a broad taxonomic suitability for eukaryotes, which suppress the amplification of mussels. The primers were tested using mussel DNA extracts and the results were compared to eDNA water samples collected next to the mussel colonies. Taxonomic recovery, as well as patterns of alpha and beta diversity, were compared between mussels and water samples. In addition, we analyzed time series samples of mussel samples from different German rivers. Our primer sets efficiently block the amplification of various mussel genera. The recovered DNA reflects a broad dietary preference across the eukaryotic tree of life and considerable taxonomic overlap with filtered water samples. We also recover various taxa of possible commensals and parasites, associated with the mussels. Our protocol will enable large scale dietary analysis in mussels, facilitate aquatic food web analysis, elucidate the ecological impact of invasive bivalves and the rapid survey of mussel aquacultures for pathogens. Moreover, we show that mussels could serve as an interesting complementary DNA source for biomonitoring.",

    "abstract": "Charophytes are a refuge for zooplankton and stabilize sediments, but they are also a food source for various animal species (water birds, fishes, invertebrates). Especially the introduction of new species, like Gammarus tigrinus, into the Baltic Sea led to yet not understood changes in the food web. Furthermore, future projections point to increased water temperatures at lowered salinity levels affecting species capacity to acclimatize to changing abiotic factors. In this study we investigated the influence of temperature and salinity on the grazing pressure of Gammarus tigrinus on two charophyte species: Chara aspera and Chara tomentosa. The grazing experiments were conducted in a full factorial design with the factors salinity (3 - 13 g kg-1), temperature (5 - 30 {degrees}C), and charophyte species. Grazing rates were determined as mass deviation within 48 hours considering biomass changes in the presence and absence of gammarids. Grazing rate were further used to calculate charophyte losses in two coastal lagoons with different salinity concentrations for recent and future time periods. The potential grazing peak of about 24 {degrees}C is not yet reached in these coastal waters but may be reached in the near future as shown by our future projection results. However, the temperature increase, and desalination will cause a shift in seasonal individual grazing patterns from summer to spring and autumn. Desalination and temperature increase can lead to a shift in optimal habitats for G. tigrinus in the future.",

    "abstract": "The 1972 World Heritage Convention (WHC), along with the 1994 Global Strategy, aim to preserve the outstanding universal value of internationally important cultural and natural sites within a \"representative, balanced and credible\" network of highly-protected areas. Increasing human pressures and shortfalls in representation have been documented across the World Heritage network, particularly in terrestrial and cultural sites, threatening the integrity and primary goals of the WHC. However, the conservation status of current and tentative (i.e., proposed) marine natural World Heritage areas remains relatively unknown. We assessed the extent of recent (2013) and historical (2008-2013) cumulative human impacts and several metrics of representation (country, continent, ecoregion, wilderness, and threatened species) within existing and tentative marine natural World Heritage areas. We found moderate yet increasing cumulative human impacts across most existing sites, and high or very high impacts across the majority of tentative sites. Climate change impacts comprised nearly 75% of impact scores, on average, and differences in land and marine impacts across sites could help prioritise management decisions. Over 75% of marine ecoregions and 85% of threatened species considered in this study have no representation within the existing marine natural World Heritage network. We outline examples of how prioritizing representation across tentative sites for future World Heritage listing could greatly increase these measures. We urge the WHC to adopt quantitative, systematic and transparent evaluations of how current and tentative sites contribute to the overarching goals of maintaining a representative World Heritage network and preserving their outstanding universal values for future generations.",

    "abstract": "Additive and dominance genetic variances underlying the expression of quantitative traits are important quantities for predicting short-term responses to selection, but they are notoriously challenging to estimate in most non-model wild populations. Specifically, large-sized or panmictic populations may be characterized by low variance in genetic relatedness among individuals which in turn, can prevent accurate estimation of quantitative genetic parameters. We used estimates of genome-wide identity-by-descent (IBD) sharing from autosomal SNP loci to estimate quantitative genetic parameters for ecologically important traits in nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) from a large, outbred population. Using empirical and simulated datasets, with varying sample sizes and pedigree complexity, we assessed the performance of different crossing schemes in estimating additive genetic variance and heritability for all traits. We found that low variance in relatedness characteristic of wild outbred populations with high migration rate can impair the estimation of quantitative genetic parameters and bias heritability estimates downwards. On the other hand, the use of a half-sib/full-sib design allowed precise estimation of genetic variance components, and revealed significant additive variance and heritability for all measured traits, with negligible dominance contributions. Genome-partitioning and QTL mapping analyses revealed that most traits had a polygenic basis and were controlled by genes at multiple chromosomes. Furthermore, different QTL contributed to variation in the same traits in different populations suggesting heterogenous underpinnings of parallel evolution at the phenotypic level. Our results provide important guidelines for future studies aimed at estimating adaptive potential in the wild, particularly for those conducted in outbred large-sized populations.",

    "abstract": "In many biological populations, individuals face a complex strategic setting, where they need to make strategic decisions over a diverse set of issues. To study evolution in such a complex strategic context, here we introduce evolutionary models where individuals play two games with different structures. Individuals decide upon their strategy in a second game based on their knowledge of their opponents strategy in the first game. By considering a case where the first game is a social dilemma, we show that, as long as the second game has an asymmetric Nash equilibrium, the system possesses a spontaneous symmetry-breaking phase transition above which the symmetry between cooperation and defection breaks. A set of cooperation supporting moral norms emerges according to which cooperation stands out as a valuable trait. Notably, the moral system also brings a more efficient allocation of resources in the second game. This observation suggests a moral system has two different roles: Promotion of cooperation, which is against individuals self-interest but beneficial for the population, and promotion of organization and order, which is at both the populations and the individuals self-interest. Interestingly, the latter acts like a Trojan horse: Once established out of individuals self-interest, it brings the former with itself. Furthermore, we show that in structured populations, recognition noise can have a surprisingly positive effect on the evolution of moral norms and facilitates cooperation in the Snow Drift game.",

    "abstract": "PurposeUpshaw-Schulman syndrome (USS) is an autosomal recessive disease of thrombotic microangiopathy, caused by pathogenic variants in ADAMTS13. We aimed to (1) perform data mining pathogenicity of ADAMTS13 variants, (2) estimate carrier frequency and genetic prevalence of USS from gnomAD data, and (3) curated ADAMTS13 gene pathogenic variants dataset.\n\nMethodsPubMed and Scopus were comprehensive retrieved. All previously reported pathogenic ADAMTS13 variants were compiled and annotated with gnomAD allele frequencies. Pooled global and population-specific carrier frequency and genetic prevalence for USS were calculated using Hardy-Weinberg equation.\n\nResultswe mined reported disease-causing variants, of these were present in gnomAD exomes v2.1.1, filtering by allele frequency, pathogenicity of variants were classified by American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria. The genetic prevalence and carrier frequency of USS was 0.43 per 1 million (95% CI: [0.36, 0.55]) and 1.31 per thousand, respectively. Combining known with novel pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants, the genetic prevalence and carrier frequency are 1.1 per 1 million (95% CI: [0.89, 1.37]) and 2.1 per thousand, respectively.\n\nConclusionthe genetic prevalence and carrier frequency of Upshaw-Schulman syndrome are within range of previously rough estimated.",

    "abstract": "Pregnancy 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are associated with maternal and fetal health outcomes. Using physiological human placental perfusion and villous explants, we investigate the role of the placenta in regulating the relationships between maternal 25(OH)D and fetal physiology. We demonstrate active placental uptake of 25(OH)D3 by endocytosis, placental metabolism of 25(OH)D3 into 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D3], with subsequent release of these metabolites into both the maternal and fetal circulations. Active placental transport of 25(OH)D3 and synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D3 demonstrate that fetal supply is dependent on placental function rather than simply the availability of maternal 25(OH)D3. We demonstrate that 25(OH)D3 exposure induces rapid effects on the placental transcriptome and proteome. These map to multiple pathways central to placental function and thereby fetal development, independent of vitamin D transfer. Our data suggest that the underlying epigenetic landscape helps dictate the transcriptional response to vitamin D treatment. This is the first quantitative study demonstrating vitamin D transfer and metabolism by the human placenta, with widespread effects on the placenta itself. These data demonstrate a complex interplay between vitamin D and the placenta and will inform future interventions using vitamin D to support fetal development and maternal adaptations to pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "The architecture of the efferent auditory system enables prioritization of strongly overlapping spatiotemporal cochlear activation patterns elicited by relevant and irrelevant inputs. So far, attempts at finding such attentional modulations of cochlear activity delivered indirect insights in humans or required direct recordings in animals. The extent to which spiral ganglion cells forming the human auditory nerve are sensitive to selective attention remains largely unknown. We investigated this question by testing the effects of attending to either the auditory or visual modality in human cochlear implant (CI) users (3 female, 13 male). Auditory nerve activity was directly recorded with standard CIs during a silent (anticipatory) cue-target interval. When attending the upcoming auditory input, ongoing auditory nerve activity within the theta range (5-8 Hz) was enhanced. Crucially, using the broadband signal (4-25 Hz), a classifier was even able to decode the attended modality from single-trial data. Follow-up analysis showed that the effect was not driven by a narrow frequency in particular. Using direct cochlear recordings from deaf individuals, our findings suggest that cochlear spiral ganglion cells are sensitive to top-down attentional modulations. Given the putatively broad hair-cell degeneration of these individuals, the effects are likely mediated by alternative efferent pathways as compared to previous studies using otoacoustic emissions. Successful classification of single-trial data could additionally have a significant impact on future closed-loop CI developments that incorporate real-time optimization of CI parameters based on the current mental state of the user.\n\nSignificance StatementThe efferent auditory system in principle allows top-down modulation of auditory nerve activity, however evidence for this is lacking in humans. Using cochlear recordings in participants performing an audiovisual attention task, we show that ongoing auditory nerve activity in the silent cue-target period is directly modulated by selective attention. Specifically, ongoing auditory nerve activity is enhanced within the theta range when attending upcoming auditory input. Furthermore, over a broader frequency range, the attended modality can be decoded from single-trial data. Demonstrating this direct top-down influence on auditory nerve activity substantially extends previous works that focus on outer hair cell activity. Generally, our work could promote the use of standard cochlear implant electrodes to study cognitive neuroscientific questions.",

    "abstract": "The Eureka effect refers to the common experience of suddenly solving a problem. Here we study this effect in a pattern recognition paradigm that requires the segmentation of complex scenes and recognition of objects on the basis of Gestalt rules and prior knowledge. In the experiments both sensory evidence and prior knowledge were manipulated in order to obtain trials that do or do not converge towards a perceptual solution. Subjects had to detect objects in blurred scenes and signal recognition with manual responses. Neural dynamics were analyzed with high-density Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. The results show significant changes of neural dynamics with respect to spectral distribution, coherence, phase locking, and fractal dimensionality. The Eureka effect was associated with increased coherence of oscillations in the alpha and theta band over widely distributed regions of the cortical mantle predominantly in the right hemisphere. This increase in coherence was associated with a decrease of beta band activity over parietal and central regions, and with a decrease of alpha power over frontal and occipital areas. In addition, there was a lateralized reduction of fractal dimensionality for activity recorded from the right hemisphere. These results suggest that the transition towards the solution of a perceptual task is mainly associated with a change of network dynamics in the right hemisphere that is characterized by enhanced coherence and reduced complexity. We propose that the Eureka effect requires cooperation of cortical regions involved in working memory, creative thinking, and the control of attention.",

    "abstract": "As one of the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, transcription and translations uncoupling plays an essential role in development and adulthood physiology. However, it remains elusive how thousands of mRNAs get translationally silenced while stability is maintained for up to hours or even days before translation. In addition to oocytes and neurons, developing spermatids have significant uncoupling of transcription and translation for delayed translation. Therefore, spermiogenesis represents an excellent in vivo model for investigating the mechanism underlying uncoupled transcription and translation. Through full-length poly(A) deep sequencing, we discovered dynamic changes in poly(A) length through deadenylation and re-polyadenylation. Deadenylation appeared to be mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs), and transcripts with shorter poly(A) tails tend to be sequestered into ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) for translational repression and stabilization. In contrast, re-polyadenylation allows for translocation of the translationally repressed transcripts from RNPs to polysomes for translation. Overall, our data suggest that miRNA-dependent poly(A) length control represents a novel mechanism underlying uncoupled translation and transcription in haploid male germ cells.",

    "abstract": "Aging arises from complex interactions among multiple biochemical and metabolic products. Systems-level analyses of biological networks may provide insights into the causes and consequences of aging that evade single-gene or single-pathway studies. We have shown that dietary choice per se is sufficient to modulate aging and metabolic health in the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster. In other words, how each meal is presented, or the way in which it is eaten, is influential, independent of the amount or type of nutrients that are consumed. For example, when major macronutrients were presented separately, male flies exhibited a rapid and significant increase in mortality rate and a reduced overall lifespan relative to those fed a single medium containing both sugar and yeast. These effects are mediated by specific components of serotonin signaling, as a mutation in serotonin receptor 2A (5-HT2A) eliminated the effects of dietary choice. Here we show that dietary choice influenced several measures of metabolic network integrity, including connectivity, average shortest distance, community structure, and robustness, with the effects of the latter two restricted to tissues in the head. These changes in network structure were associated with organism resilience and increased susceptibility to genetic perturbation, as measured by starvation survival. Our data suggest that the behavioral or perceptual consequences of exposure to individual macronutrients, involving serotonin signaling through 5-HT2A, qualitatively change the state of metabolic networks throughout the organism from one that is highly connected and robust to one that is fragmented, fragile, and vulnerable to perturbations.",

We show that there are several classes of systems that exhibit this behavior: a)systems with monomial-type interaction terms and b)systems with linear or nonlinear conservation laws. While models derived from mass-action principles often present with linear conservation laws stemming from the underlying biologic rationale, nonlinear conservation laws are more subtle and harder to detect. Nevertheless, in both situations the corresponding ODE system will contain non-hyperbolic equilibria. While having a potentially more complex dynamics and falling outside of the scope of existing theoretical frameworks, this class of systems can still exhibit adapting behavior associated with certain nodes and inputs. We derive a generalized adaptation condition that extends to singular systems and is compatible with both single-input/single-output and multiple-input/multiple-output settings. The approach explored herein, based on the notion of Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, is tested on several synthetic systems that are shown to exhibit homeostatic behavior but are not covered by existing methods. These results highlight the role of the network structure and modeling assumptions when understanding system response to input and can be helpful in discovering intrinsic relationships between the nodes.",

    "abstract": "Updated and revised versions of COVID-19 vaccines are vital due to genetic variations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen. Furthermore, vaccines that are safe, cost-effective, and logistically friendly are critically needed for global equity, especially for middle to low income countries. Recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been reported with the use of the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the prefusion spike trimers (S-2P). Recently, a new version of prefusion spike trimers, so called \"HexaPro\", has been shown for its physical property to possess two RBD in the \"up\" conformation, as opposed to just one exposed RBD found in S-2P. Importantly, this HexaPro spike antigen is more stable than S-2P, raising its feasibility for global logistics and supply chain. Here, we report that the spike protein HexaPro offers a promising candidate for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Mice immunized by the recombinant HexaPro adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide using a prime-boost regimen produced high-titer neutralizing antibodies for up to 56 days after initial immunization against live SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the level of neutralization activity is comparable to that of convalescence sera. Our results indicate that the HexaPro subunit vaccine confers neutralization activity in sera collected from mice receiving the prime-boost regimen.",

It affects several vital organs, seemingly through a pathological effect on endothelial cells. The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes 29 proteins, whose contribution to the disease manifestations, and especially endothelial complications, is unknown. We cloned and expressed 26 of these proteins in human cells and characterized the endothelial response to overexpression of each, individually. Whereas most proteins induced significant changes in endothelial permeability, nsp2, nsp5_c145a (catalytic dead mutant of nsp5) and nsp7 also reduced CD31, and increased von Willebrand factor expression and IL-6, suggesting endothelial dysfunction. Using propagation-based analysis of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, we predicted the endothelial proteins affected by the viral proteins that potentially mediate these effects.

    "abstract": "We describe, for the first time, a new splice variant of the human TGF-{beta} type II receptor (T{beta}RII). The new transcript lacks 149 nucleotides, causing a frameshift with the appearance of an early stop codon, rendering a truncated mature protein of 57 amino acids. The predicted protein, lacking the transmembrane domain and with a distinctive 13 amino acid stretch in the C-terminus, was named T{beta}RII-Soluble Endogenous (T{beta}RII-SE). Binding predictions indicated that the novel 13 amino acid stretch interacts with all three TGF-{beta} cognate ligands and generate a more extensive protein-protein interface than T{beta}RII. T{beta}RII-SE and human IgG1 Fc-domain, were fused in frame in a lentiviral vector (Lv) for further characterization. With this vector, we transduced 293T cells and purified T{beta}RII-SE/Fc by A/G protein chromatography from conditioned medium. Immunoblotting revealed homogeneous bands of approximately 37 kDa (reduced) and 75 kD (non-reduced), indicating that T{beta}RII-SE/Fc is secreted as a disulphide-linked homodimer. Moreover, high affinity binding of T{beta}RII-SE to the three TGF-{beta} isoforms was confirmed by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) analysis. Also, intrahepatic delivery of Lv.T{beta}RII-SE/Fc in a carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis model revealed amelioration of liver injury and fibrosis. Our results indicate that T{beta}RII-SE is a novel member of the TGF-{beta} signaling pathway with distinctive characteristics. This novel protein offers an alternative for the prevention and treatment of pathologies caused by the overproduction of TGF-{beta} ligands.",

    "abstract": "Cells inherit two centrioles, the older of which is uniquely capable of generating a cilium. Using proteomics and super-resolved imaging, we identified a module which we term DISCO (DIStal centriole COmplex). DISCO components CEP90, MNR and OFD1 underlie human ciliopathies. This complex localized to both distal centrioles and centriolar satellites, proteinaceous granules surrounding centrioles. Cells and mice lacking CEP90 or MNR did not generate cilia, failed to assemble distal appendages, and did not transduce Hedgehog signals. Disrupting the satellite pools did not affect distal appendage assembly, indicating that it is the centriolar populations of MNR and CEP90 that are critical for ciliogenesis. CEP90 recruited the most proximal known distal appendage component, CEP83, to root distal appendages formation, an early step in ciliogenesis. In addition, MNR, but not CEP90, restricted centriolar length by recruiting OFD1. We conclude that DISCO acts at the distal centriole to support ciliogenesis by restraining centriole length and assembling distal appendages, defects in which cause human ciliopathies.\n\neTOC summaryKumar et al. identifies a multi-protein complex called DISCO (DIStal centriole COmplex) required to nucleate distal appendages and restrain centriole elongation, essential for the initiation of cilium assembly. Without DISCO, cells fail to ciliate and transduce Hedgehog signals, critical for mammalian development.",

In this study, we demonstrated that mTOR dependent classical autophagy is ubiquitously triggered in differentiating monocytes. Moreover, autophagy plays a decisive role in sustaining the process of monocyte to macrophage differentiation. We have delved deeper into understanding the underlying mechanistic complexities that trigger autophagy during differentiation. We have also shown that autophagy directs monocyte differentiation via protein degradation. Further, we delineated the complex cross-talk between autophagy and cell-cycle arrest in differentiating monocytes. This study also inspects the contribution of adhesion on various steps of autophagy and its ultimate impact on monocyte differentiation. Our study reveals new mechanistic insights into the process of autophagy associated with monocyte differentiation and would undoubtedly help to understand the intricacies of the process better for the effective design of therapeutics as autophagy and autophagy-related processes have enormous importance in human patho-physiology.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Adhesive interactions are essential for tissue patterning and morphogenesis yet difficult to study owing to functional redundancies across genes and gene families. A useful system in which to dissect roles for cell adhesion and adhesion-dependent signaling is the pattern formed by pigment cells in skin of adult zebrafish, in which stripes represent the arrangement of neural crest derived melanophores, cells homologous to melanocytes. In a forward genetic screen for adult pattern defects, we isolated the pissarro (psr) mutant, having a variegated phenotype of spots, as well as defects in adult fin and lens. We show that psr corresponds to junctional adhesion protein 3b (jam3b) encoding a zebrafish orthologue of the two immunoglobulin-like domain receptor JAM3 (JAM-C), known for roles in adhesion and signaling in other developing tissues, and for promoting metastatic behavior of human and murine melanoma cells. We found that zebrafish jam3b is expressed post-embryonically in a variety of cells including melanophores, and that jam3b mutants have defects in melanophore survival. Jam3b supported aggregation of cells in vitro and was required autonomously by melanophores for an adherent phenotype in vivo. Genetic analyses further indicated both overlapping and non-overlapping functions with the related receptor, Immunoglobulin superfamily 11 (Igsf11) and Kit receptor tyrosine kinase. These findings suggest a model for Jam3b function in zebrafish melanophores and hint at the complexity of adhesive interactions underlying pattern formation.",

    "abstract": "The force-induced unfolding and refolding of proteins is speculated to be a key mechanism in the sensing and transduction of mechanical signals in the living cell. Yet, little evidence has been gathered for its existence in vivo. Prominently, stretch-induced unfolding is postulated to be the activation mechanism of the twitchin/titin family of autoinhibited sarcomeric kinases linked to the mechanical stress response of muscle. To test the occurrence of mechanical kinase activation in living working muscle, we generated transgenic C. elegans expressing twitchin containing FRET moieties flanking the kinase domain and developed a quantitative technique for extracting FRET signals in freely moving C. elegans, using tracking and simultaneous imaging of animals in three channels (donor fluorescence, acceptor fluorescence, and transmitted light). Computer vision algorithms were used to extract fluorescence signals and muscle contraction states in each frame, in order to obtain fluorescence and body curvature measurements with spatial and temporal precision in vivo. The data revealed statistically significant periodic changes in FRET signals during muscle activity, consistent with a periodic change in the conformation of twitchin kinase. We conclude that stretch-unfolding of twitchin kinase occurs in the active muscle, whereby mechanical activity titrates the signalling pathway of this cytoskeletal kinase. We anticipate that the methods we have developed here could be applied to obtaining in vivo evidence for force-induced conformational changes or elastic behavior of other proteins not only in C. elegans but in other animals in which there is optical transparency (e.g zebrafish).",

    "abstract": "Most cancer deaths result from progression of therapy resistant disease, yet our understanding of this phenotype is limited. Cancer therapies generate stress signals that act upon mitochondria to initiate apoptotic programs. We isolated mitochondria from neuroblastoma cell lines obtained from children at diagnosis and after relapse following failed therapy, and profiled responses to tBid and Bim, death effectors activated by therapeutic stress. Mitochondria from post-relapse models had markedly attenuated cytochrome c release (surrogate for apoptotic commitment) in comparison with patient-matched diagnostic models. Mitochondrial DNA content, size, and shape did not differ consistently. However, we used electron microscopy to identify reduced endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contacts (ERMCs) as correlated with therapy resistance. ERMCs form microdomains for the transfer of Ca2+ to mitochondria. We confirmed reduced Ca2+ transfer in resistant cells, with restoration by re-opposing ERMCs via genetically-encoded linkers. However, reduced Ca2+ transfer was not present in all ERMC-reduced cancers with therapy resistance, supporting Ca2+-independent mechanisms. Genetically or biochemically reducing ERMCs in therapy sensitive tumors phenocopied resistance, validating these inter-organelle contacts as physiologic regulators of apoptosis. Our work confirms the importance of ERMCs in stress signaling and provides a previously unrecognized mechanism for cancer cell resistance that is not exclusive to other contributors.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHerbal medicinal products have a long-standing history of use in the therapy of common respiratory infections. In the COVID-19 pandemic, they may have the potential for symptom relief in non-severe or moderate disease cases. Here we describe the results derived by in vitro screening of five herbal medicinal products with regard to their potential to i) interfere with the binding of the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein, ii) modulate the release of the human defensin HBD1 and cathelicidin LL-37 from human A549 lung cells upon Spike S1 protein stimulation and iii) modulate the release of IFN-{gamma} from activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The investigated extracts were: Sinupret extract (SINx), Bronchipret thyme-ivy (BRO TE), Bronchipret thyme-primrose (BRO TP), Imupret (IMU), and Tonsipret (TOP).\n\nMethodsThe inhibitory effect of the herbal medicinal products on the binding interaction of Spike S1 protein and the human ACE2 receptor was measured by ELISA. The effects on intracellular IFN-{gamma} expression in stimulated human PBMCs were measured by flow cytometry. Regulation on HBD1 and LL-37 expression and secretion was assessed in 25d long-term cultured human lung A549 epithelial cells by RT-PCR and ELISA.\n\nResultsIMU and BRO TE concentration-dependently inhibited the interaction between spike protein and the ACE2 Receptor. However, this effect was only observed in the cell-free assay at a concentration range which was later on determined as cytotoxic to human PBMC. SINx, TOP and BRO TP significantly upregulated the intracellular expression of antiviral IFN{gamma} from stimulated PBMC. Co-treatment of A549 cells with IMU or BRO TP together with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein significantly upregulated mRNA expression (IMU) and release (IMU and BRO TP) of HBD1 and LL-37 (BRO TP).\n\nConclusionsThe in vitro screening results provide first evidence for an immune activating potential of some of the tested herbal medicinal extracts in the context of SARS-CoV-2. Whether these could be helpful in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 invasion or supportive in recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection needs deeper understanding of the observations.",

This concept extends in vitro, where the extracellular milieu can also influence BBB properties in cultured cells. However, the extent to which baseline culture conditions can affect BBB properties in vitro remains unclear, which has implications for model variability and reproducibility, as well as downstream assessments of molecular transport and disease phenotypes. Here, we explore this concept by examining BBB properties within human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived BMEC-like cells cultured under serum-free conditions in different basal media with fully defined compositions. We demonstrate notable differences in both passive and active BBB properties as a function of basal media composition. Further, RNA sequencing and phosphoproteome analyses revealed alterations to various signaling pathways in response to basal media differences. Overall, our results demonstrate that baseline culture conditions can have a profound influence on the performance of in vitro BBB models, and these effects should be considered when designing experiments that utilize such models for basic research and preclinical assays.",

Infection of H522 cells required the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, though in contrast to ACE2-dependent models, spike alone was not sufficient for H522 infection. Temporally resolved transcriptomic and proteomic profiling revealed alterations in cell cycle and the antiviral host cell response, including MDA5-dependent activation of type-I interferon signaling. Focused chemical screens point to important roles for clathrin-mediated endocytosis and endosomal cathepsins in SARS-CoV-2 infection of H522 cells.

    "abstract": "As enveloped virus, SARS-CoV-2 membrane protein (M) mediates viral release from cellular membranes, but the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 virions release remain poorly understood. Here, we performed RNAi screening and identified the E3 ligase RNF5 which mediates ubiquitination of SARS-CoV-2 M at residue K15 to enhance the interaction of viral envelope (E) with M. M-E complex ensures the uniform size of viral particles for viral maturation and mediates viral release. Moreover, overexpression of M induces complete autophagy which is dependent on RNF5-mediated ubiquitin modification. M inhibits the activity of lysosome protease, and uses autolysosomes for virion release. Consequently, all these results demonstrate that RNF5 mediates ubiquitin modification of SARS-CoV-2 M to stabilize the M-E complex and induce autophagy for virion release.",

    "abstract": "Reproduction is under multifactorial control of neurohormones, pituitary gonadotropins, as well as a number of gonadal hormones including sex steroids and growth factors. Gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (Gnih), a novel RFamide neuropeptide, was shown to be involved in the control of pituitary gonadotropin production, as well as being involved as a paracrine factor in the regulation of gonadal function. In this context, recent studies have demonstrated that Gnih inhibited gonadotropin-induced spermatogenesis in the zebrafish testicular explants. Thyroid hormones are known to interact with the reproductive axis, and are, in particular, involved in the regulation of testicular function. Based on this background, we investigated the interaction between Gnih and thyroid hormones in the control of zebrafish spermatogenesis. To this end, zebrafish adult males were treated with the goitrogen methimazole (1mM for 21 days) in order to generate a hypothyroid model organism. Subsequently, a factorial design using an ex vivo testis culture system in combination with histomorphometrical and FACScan cell cycle analyses were adopted. Our results showed that methimazole treatment affected both basal and gonadotropin-induced spermatogenesis, in particular, meiosis and spermiogenesis. Moreover, the goitrogen treatment nullified the inhibitory actions of Gnih on the gonadotropin-induced spermatogenesis, specifically in the haploid cell population. We have demonstrated that thyroid hormones interaction with gonadotropin and Gnih are important components for the regulation of zebrafish spermatogenesis. The results provide a support for the hypothesis that thyroid hormones are important contributors in multifactorial control of spermatogenesis in zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "Aspergillosis is an important opportunistic human disease caused by filamentous fungi in the genus Aspergillus. Roughly 70% of infections are caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, with the rest stemming from approximately a dozen other Aspergillus species. Several of these pathogens are closely related to A. fumigatus and belong in the same taxonomic section, section Fumigati. Pathogenic species are frequently most closely related to non-pathogenic ones, suggesting Aspergillus pathogenicity evolved multiple times independently. To understand the repeated evolution of Aspergillus pathogenicity, we performed comparative genomic analyses on 18 strains from 13 species, including 8 species in section Fumigati, which aimed to identify genes, both ones previously connected to virulence as well as ones never before implicated, whose evolution differs between pathogens and non-pathogens. We found that most genes were present in all species, including approximately half of those previously connected to virulence, but a few genes were section- or species-specific. Evolutionary rate analyses identified hundreds of genes in pathogens that were faster-evolving than their orthologs in non-pathogens. For example, over 25% of all single-copy genes examined in A. fumigatus were faster-evolving. Functional testing of deletion mutants of 17 transcription factor-encoding genes whose evolution differed between pathogens and non-pathogens identified eight genes that affect either fungal survival in a model of phagocytic killing, host survival in an animal model of fungal disease, or both. These results suggest that the evolution of pathogenicity in Aspergillus involved both conserved and species-specific genetic elements, illustrating how an evolutionary genomic approach informs the study of fungal disease.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCircular RNAs (circRNAs) are found across eukaryotes and can function in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Their biogenesis through a circle-forming backsplicing reaction is facilitated by reverse-complementary repetitive sequences promoting pre-mRNA folding. Orthologous genes from which circRNAs arise, overall contain more strongly conserved splice sites and exons than other genes, yet it remains unclear to what extent this conservation reflects purifying selection acting on the circRNAs themselves. Our analyses of circRNA repertoires from five species representing three mammalian lineages (marsupials, eutherians: rodents, primates) reveal that surprisingly few circRNAs arise from orthologous exonic loci across all species. Even the circRNAs from orthologous loci are associated with young, recently active and species-specific transposable elements, rather than with common, ancient transposon integration events. These observations suggest that many circRNAs emerged convergently during evolution - as a byproduct of splicing in orthologs prone to transposon insertion. Overall, our findings argue against widespread functional circRNA conservation.",

    "abstract": "Pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP), the enzymatic cofactor form of Vitamin B6 (vitB6), is a versatile compound that has essential roles in metabolism. Cellular PLP homeostasic regulation is currently not well understood. Here we report that in Arabidopsis, biosynthesized PLP is sequestered by specific aminotransferases (ATs), and that the proteins ROOT UV-B SENSITIVE 1 (RUS1) and RUS2 function with ATs to regulate PLP homeostasis. The stunted growth phenotypes of rus1 and rus2 mutants were previously shown to be rescuable by exogenously supplied vitB6. Specific residue changes near the PLP-binding pocket in ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE2 (ASP2) also rescued rus1 and rus2 phenotypes. In this study, saturated suppressor screens identified 14 additional suppressor of rus (sor) alleles in four aminotransferase genes (ASP1, ASP2, ASP3, or ALANIN AMINOTRANSFERASE1 (AAT1)), which suppressed the rus phenotypes to varying degrees. Each of the sor mutations altered an amino acid in the PLP-binding pocket of the protein, and sor proteins were found to have reduced levels of PLP conjugation. Genetic data revealed that the availability of PLP normally requires both RUS1 and RUS2, and that increasing the number of sor mutants additively enhanced the suppression of rus phenotypes. Biochemical results showed that RUS1 and RUS2 physically interacted with ATs. Our studies suggest a mechanism in which RUS1, RUS2 and specific ATs work together to regulate PLP homeostasis in Arabidopsis.",

    "abstract": "PRDM9 drives recombination hotspots in some mammals, including mice and apes. Non-functional orthologs of PRDM9 are present in a wide variety of vertebrates, but why it is functionally maintained in some lineages is not clear. One possible explanation is that PRDM9 plays a role in ensuring that meiosis is successful. During meiosis, available DNA may be a limiting resource given the tight packaging of chromosomes and could lead to competition between two key processes: meiotic transcription and recombination. Here we explore this potential competition and the role that PRDM9 might play in their interaction. Leveraging existing mouse genomic data, we use resampling schemes that simulate shuffled features along the genome and models that account for the rarity of features in the genome, to test if PRDM9 influences interactions between recombination hotspots and meiotic transcription in a whole genome framework. We also explored possible DNA sequence motifs associated to clusters of hotspots not tied to transcription or PRDM9. We find evidence of competition between meiotic transcription and recombination, with PRDM9 appearing to relocate recombination to avoid said conflict. We also find that retrotransposons may be playing a role in directing hotspots in the absence of other factors.",

    "abstract": "The rate at which individuals age underlies variation in life history and attendant health and disease trajectories. Age specific patterning of the DNA methylome (\"epigenetic aging\") is strongly correlated with chronological age in humans and can be modeled to produce epigenetic age predictors. However, epigenetic age estimates vary among individuals of the same age, and this mismatch is correlated to the onset of age-related disease and all-cause mortality. Yet, the origins of epigenetic-to-chronological age discordance are not resolved. In an effort to develop a tractable model in which environmental drivers of epigenetic aging can be assessed, we investigate the relationship between aging and DNA methylation in a small teleost, medaka (Oryzias latipes). We find that age-associated DNA methylation patterning occurs broadly across the genome, with the majority of age-related changes occurring during early life. By modeling the stereotypical nature of age-associated DNA methylation dynamics, we built an epigenetic clock, which predicts chronological age with a mean error of 29.1 days (~4% of average lifespan). Characterization of clock loci suggests that aspects of epigenetic aging are functionally similar across vertebrates. To understand how environmental factors interact with epigenetic aging, we exposed medaka to four doses of ionizing radiation for seven weeks, hypothesizing that exposure to such an environmental stressor would accelerate epigenetic aging. While the epigenetic clock was not significantly affected, radiation exposure accelerated and decelerated patterns of normal epigenetic aging, with radiation-induced epigenetic alterations enriched at loci that become hypermethylated with age. Together, our findings advance ongoing research attempting to elucidate the functional role of DNA methylation in integrating environmental factors into the rate of biological aging.",

Overall, most variation across tissues during day-night and among seasons was unique to each cycle. Although all tissues remodeled their transcriptomes, brain and gonadal tissues exhibited the highest seasonality, whereas those in the thoracic cavity showed stronger day-night regulation. Core clock genes displayed marked day-night differences across multiple tissues, which were largely conserved in baboon and mouse, but adapted to their nocturnal or diurnal habits. Seasonal variation of expression affected multiple pathways and it was enriched among genes associated with the immune response, consistent with the seasonality of viral infections. Furthermore, they unveiled cytoarchitectural changes in brain regions. Altogether, our results provide the first combined atlas of how transcriptomes from human tissues adapt to major cycling environmental conditions.",

Here, we report the complete structural characterization of intact O-glycan proteoforms using native top-down mass spectrometry (MS). By combining trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS), which can separate the protein conformers of S-RBD and analyze their gas phase structural variants, with ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) MS analysis, the O-glycoforms of the S-RBD are comprehensively characterized, so that seven O-glycoforms and their relative molecular abundance are structurally elucidated for the first time. These findings demonstrate that native top-down MS can provide a high-resolution proteoform-resolved mapping of diverse O-glycoforms of the S glycoprotein, which lays a strong molecular foundation to uncover the functional roles of their O-glycans. This proteoform-resolved approach can be applied to reveal the structural O-glycoform heterogeneity of emergent SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD variants, as well as other O-glycoproteins in general.",

We identified and characterized two lncNATs (NAT1UGT73C6 and NAT2UGT73C6, collectively NATsUGT73C6) in Arabidopsis thaliana that are transcribed from a gene overlapping UGT73C6, a member of the UGT73C subfamily of genes encoding UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs). Expression of both NATsUGT73C6 is developmentally controlled and occurs independently of the transcription of UGT73C6 in cis. Downregulation of NATsUGT73C6 levels through artificial microRNAs results in a reduction of the rosette area, while constitutive overexpression of NAT1UGT73C6 or NAT2UGT73C6 leads to the opposite phenotype, an increase in rosette size. This activity of NATsUGT73C6 relies on its RNA sequence, and, although modulation of UGT73C6 in cis cannot be excluded, the observed phenotypes are not a consequence of the regulation of UGT73C6 in trans. The NATsUGT73C6 levels were shown to affect cell proliferation and thus individual leaf size. Consistent with this concept, our data suggest that the NATsUGT73C6 modulate the expression levels of key transcription factors involved in regulating leaf growth by modulating cell proliferation.

Here, 16 CCR genes are identified from Brassica napus and its parental species B. rapa and B. oleracea. Brassicaceae CCR genes are divided into CCR1 subfamily and CCR2 subfamily with divergent organ-specificity, yellow-seed trait participation and stresses responsiveness. CCR1 is preferential in G- and H-lignins biosynthesis and vascular development, while CCR2 has a deviation to S-lignin biosynthesis and interfascicular fiber development. CCR1 has stronger effects on lignification-related development, lodging resistance, phenylpropanoid flux control and seed coat pigmentation, whereas CCR2 controls sinapates levels. CCR1 upregulation could delay bolting and flowering time, while CCR2 upregulation weakens vascular system in leaf due to suppressed G lignin accumulation. Besides, CCR1 and CCR2 are deeply but almost oppositely linked with glucosinolates metabolism through inter-pathway crosstalk. Strangely, upregulation of both CCR1 and CCR2 could not enhance resistance to UV-B and S. sclerotiorum though CCR2 is sharply induced by them. These results provide systemic dissection on Brassica CCRs and CCR1-CCR2 divergence in Brassicaceae.\n\nHighlightBrassicaceae contains two types of Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase.

Amid growing concerns regarding an \"infodemic\", ensuring the quality of information is a crucial vector of public health. Investigating if and how Wikipedia remained up to date and in line with science is key to formulating strategies to counter misinformation. Using citation analyses, we asked: which sources informed Wikipedias COVID-19-related articles before and during the pandemics first wave (January-May 2020).\n\nResultsWe found that coronavirus-related articles referenced trusted media sources and high-quality academic research. Moreover, despite a surge in COVID-19 preprints, Wikipedia had a clear preference for open-access studies published in respected journals and made little use of preprints. Building a timeline of English COVID-19 articles from 2001-2020 revealed a nuanced trade-off between quality and timeliness. It further showed how preexisting articles on key topics related to the virus created a framework for integrating new knowledge. Supported by a rigid sourcing policy, this \"scientific infrastructure\" facilitated contextualization and regulated the influx of new information. Lastly, we constructed a network of DOI-Wikipedia articles, which showed the shifting landscape of pandemic-related knowledge on Wikipedia and how academic citations create a web of shared knowledge supporting topics like COVID-19 vaccine development.\n\nConclusionsUnderstanding how scientific research interacts with the digital knowledge-sphere during the pandemic provides insight into how Wikipedia can facilitate access to science. It also reveals how, aided by what we term its \"citizen encyclopedists\", it successfully fended off COVID-19 disinformation and how this unique model may be deployed in other contexts.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear mixed effects models provide a way to mathematically describe experimental data involving a lot of inter-individual heterogeneity. In order to assess their practical identifiability and estimate confidence intervals for their parameters, most mixed effects modelling programs use the Fisher Information Matrix. However, in complex nonlinear models, this approach can mask practical unidentifiabilities. Herein we rather propose a multistart approach, and use it to simplify our model by reducing the number of its parameters, in order to make it identifiable. Our model describes several cell populations involved in the in vitro differentiation of chicken erythroid progenitors grown in the same environment. Inter-individual variability observed in cell population counts is explained by variations of the differentiation and proliferation rates between replicates of the experiment. Alternatively, we test a model with varying initial condition. We conclude by relating experimental variability to precise and identifiable variations between the replicates of the experiment of some model parameters.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. Around one third of patients do not respond to current medications. This lack of treatment indicates a need for better understanding of the underlying mechanisms and, importantly, the identification of novel targets for drug manipulation. The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster has a fast reproduction time, powerful genetics, and facilitates large sample sizes, making it a strong model of seizure mechanisms. However, there has not yet been a systematic analysis of the wide range of behavioral and physiological phenotypes observed across major fly seizure genotypes. To understand this, we systematically measured seizure severity and secondary behavioral phenotypes at both the larval and adult stage. Comparison of several seizure-induction methods; specifically electrical, mechanical and heat-induction, show that larval electroshock is the most effective at inducing seizures across a wide range of seizure-prone mutants. Locomotion in adults and larvae was found to be non-predictive of seizure susceptibility. Recording activity in identified larval motor neurons revealed variations in action potential patterns, across different genotypes, but these patterns did not correlate with seizure susceptibility. To conclude, while there is wide variation in mechanical induction, heat induction, and secondary phenotypes, electroshock is the most consistent method of seizure induction across known major seizure genotypes in Drosophila.\n\nSignificance StatementEpilepsy is a neurological disorder affecting 1 in 130 people globally, with a significant impact on patients, families, and society. Approximately one third of epileptics do not respond to currently available medication. Thus, better insights into underlying disease mechanisms and identification of new drugs are needed. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) are a powerful genetic model: a number of single gene mutant flies exhibit seizures, phenotypes that have been shown to respond to established antiepileptic drugs. We compare methods of seizure induction and their utility, to establish which induction method is the most consistent across a range of different seizure-inducing genetic backgrounds. Adopting a common method for seizure analysis in this model will, we predict, speed identification of novel anti-convulsive treatments.",

Site of acquisition only affected NFL, with NFL being higher in CSF acquired from lumbar compared with cisterna magna puncture.\n\nDISCUSSIONNormative values for key neurodegeneration biomarkers were established for laboratory housed cynomolgus and rhesus macaque monkeys. Differences were observed as a function of species, sex and site of CSF acquisition that should be considered when employing primate models.\n\nResearch In ContextO_LISystematic review: We reviewed reports characterizing CSF biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases in non-human primates - an increasingly important model of disease - revealing that studies with laboratory housed macaque monkeys were of small sample size, with a paucity of data about how biomarkers varied as a function of species, sex, age, and site of acquisition.\nC_LIO_LIInterpretation: To address this gap, we collected CSF from 82 naive laboratory housed male and female macaques of two species and measured A{beta}40, A{beta}42, tTau, pTau, and NFL. In addition to providing normative statistics for concentrations of these biomarkers, we revealed various species and sex differences.\nC_LIO_LIFuture directions: Establishing normative values of biomarkers is an important step to the efficient development of cynomolgus and rhesus macaques as models of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers disease. Reference values reduce the need for large control groups by which to compare with disease model animals.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) are critical to the immune response against intracellular pathogens and cancer and act by eliminating infected and malignant cells through targeted secretion of cytotoxic granules. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling has been shown to be critical for CTL killing. Interestingly, Hh signaling in CD8+ T cells is not induced by extracellular Hh ligands but is initiated upon T cell receptor (TCR) engagement. How the TCR induces the Hh pathway independently of extracellular Hh ligands is unknown. Here we show that the Hh transcription factor Gli1 is essential for efficient CTL function and is induced downstream of the TCR by an extracellular Ca2+ influx selectively controlled by L-type voltage gated Ca2+ channels localized at the plasma membrane. We demonstrate that this novel mode of Hh signaling induction is independent of the canonical Hh pathway and represents the primary mechanism of Gli1 induction in naive CD8+ T cells, while CTLs can also activate Gli1 via MAP Kinase signaling. Importantly, we show that this L-type voltage gated Ca2+ channel-controlled Gli1 induction is functionally required for CTL killing in mice and humans. Gli inhibitors are currently in clinical trials against various cancers and our observations indicate that they likely inhibit the anti-tumor response.\n\nSignificance statementCytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CTLs) kill infected and malignant cells by targeted secretion of cytotoxic granules. Hedgehog signaling is critical for effective CTL killing and is activated by the T cell receptor (TCR) independently of exogenous Hedgehog ligands. This study shows that Hedgehog transcription factor Gli1 is required for CTL killing and identifies L-type voltage gated Ca2+ channels (Cav1) as essential regulators of CTL killing in mouse and human, by virtue of their ability to activate Gli1 downstream of the TCR. This Cav1-Gli1 axis operates independently of canonical Hedgehog signaling. Our work suggests that caution is required when using Gli inhibitors, currently in trials as anti-cancer therapeutics, since they may dampen the anti-tumor response.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Most SARS-CoV-2 infections are mild or even asymptomatic. However, a small fraction of infected individuals develops severe, life-threatening disease, which is caused by an uncontrolled immune response resulting in hyperinflammation. Antiviral interventions are only effective prior to the onset of hyperinflammation. Hence, biomarkers are needed for the early identification and treatment of high-risk patients. Here, we show in a range of model systems and data from post mortem samples that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in increased levels of CD47, which is known to mediate immune escape in cancer and virus-infected cells. Systematic literature searches also indicated that known risk factors such as older age and diabetes are associated with increased CD47 levels. High CD47 levels contribute to vascular disease, vasoconstriction, and hypertension, conditions which may predispose SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to COVID-19-related complications such as pulmonary hypertension, lung fibrosis, myocardial injury, stroke, and acute kidney injury. Hence, CD47 is a candidate biomarker for severe COVID-19. Further research will have to show whether CD47 is a reliable diagnostic marker for the early identification of COVID-19 patients requiring antiviral therapy.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian genome has a complex 3D organization, serving vital functional purposes, yet it remains largely unknown how the multitude of specific DNA contacts, e.g., between transcribed and regulatory regions, is orchestrated by chromatin organizers, such as Transcription Factors. Here, we implement a method combining machine learning and polymer physics to infer from only Hi-C data the genomic 1D arrangement of the minimal set of binding sites sufficient to recapitulate, through only physics, 3D contact patterns genome-wide in human and mouse cells. The inferred binding sites are validated by their predictions on how chromatin refolds in a set of duplications at the Sox9 locus against available independent cHi-C data, showing that their different phenotypes originate from distinct enhancer hijackings in their 3D structure. Albeit derived from only Hi-C, our binding sites fall in epigenetic classes that well match chromatin states from epigenetic segmentation studies, such as active, poised and repressed states. However, the inferred binding domains have an overlapping, combinatorial organization along chromosomes, missing in epigenetic segmentations, which is required to explain Hi-C contact specificity with high accuracy. In a reverse approach, the epigenetic profile of binding domains provides a code to derive from only epigenetic marks the DNA binding sites and, hence, the 3D architecture, as validated by successful predictions of Hi-C matrices in an independent set of chromosomes. Overall, our results shed light on how complex 3D architectural information is encrypted in 1D epigenetics via the related, combinatorial arrangement of specific binding sites along the genome.",

Their functional interpretation is challenging because genome-wide enhancer-target gene (ETG) pairing is an open problem in genomics. The solutions proposed so far do not account for the most updated knowledge on chromatin three-dimensional (3D) architecture, which is organized in a hierarchy of structural domains.\n\nHere we introduce a paradigm shift based on the definition of multi-scale structural chromatin domains, integrated in a statistical framework to define ETG pairs. In this work i) we develop a computational and statistical framework to reconstruct a comprehensive ETG regulatory network leveraging functional genomics data; ii) we demonstrate that the incorporation of chromatin 3D architecture information improves ETG pairing accuracy; and iii) we use multiple experimental datasets to extensively benchmark our method against previous solutions for the genome-wide reconstruction of ETG pairs. This solution will facilitate the annotation and interpretation of sequence variants in distal non-coding regulatory elements. We expect this to be especially helpful in clinically oriented applications of whole genome sequencing in cancer and undiagnosed genetic diseases research.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorus is known as a key element associated with growth, energy, and cell signaling. In plants, phosphate transporters (PHTs) are responsible for moving and distributing phosphorus in cells and organs. PHT genes have been genome-wide identified and characterized in various plant species, however, these genes have not been widely identified based on available genomic data in Camellia sativa, which is an important oil seed plant. In the present study, we found 66 PHT genes involved in phosphate transporter/translocate in C. sativa. The recognized genes belonged to PHTs1, PHTs2, PHTs4, PHOs1, PHO1 homologs, glycerol-3-PHTs, sodium dependent PHTs, inorganic PHTs, xylulose 5-PHTs, glucose-6-phosphate translocators, and phosphoenolpyruvate translocators. Our finding revealed that PHT proteins are divers based on their physicochemical properties such as Isoelectric point (pI), molecular weight, GRAVY value, and exon-intron number(s). Besides, the expression profile of PHT genes in C. sativa based on RNA-seq data indicate that PHTs are involved in response to abiotic stresses such as cold, drought, salt, and cadmium. The tissue specific expression high expression of PHO1 genes in root tissues of C. sativa. In additions, four PHTs, including a PHT4;5 gene, a sodium dependent PHT gene, and two PHO1 homolog 3 genes were found with an upregulation in response to aforementioned studied stresses. In the current study, we found that PHO1 proteins and their homologs have high potential to post-translation modifications such as N-glycosylation and phosphorylation. Besides, different cis-acting elements associated with response to stress and phytohormone were found in the promoter region of PHT genes. Overall, our results show that PHT genes play various functions in C. Sativa and regulate Camellia responses to external and intracellular stimuli. The results can be used in future studies related to the functional genomics of C. sativa.",

Our analyses showed an unexpected relationship between leaf vein density and fruit sugar levels, where leaf vein density was negatively correlated with fruit BRIX. RNA-Seq analysis suggested variation in Glucose-6-phosphate translocator2 (GPT2) gene expression caused correlated changes in leaf vein density and BRIX when bip mutant and wildtype were compared, suggesting that the correlation between leaf vein density and fruit sugar may result from the genes regulating leaf vein development that are also involved in regulating leaf sugar biosynthesis.

    "abstract": "The pioneer event in eukaryotic DNA replication is binding of chromosomal DNA by the origin recognition complex (ORC), which directs the formation of origins, the specific chromosomal regions where DNA will be unwound for the initiation of DNA synthesis. In all eukaryotes, incompletely understood features of chromatin promote ORC-DNA binding. Here, we uncover a role for the Fkh1 (forkhead homolog) protein, and, in particular, its forkhead associated (FHA) domain in promoting ORC-origin binding and origin activity at a subset of origins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The majority of the FHA-dependent origins within the experimental subset examined contain a distinct Fkh1 binding site located 5 of and proximal to their ORC sites (5-FKH-T site). Epistasis experiments using selected FHA-dependent origins provided evidence that the FHA domain promoted origin activity through Fkh1 binding directly to this 5 FKH-T site. Nucleotide substitutions within two of these origins that enhanced the affinity of their ORC sites for ORC bypassed these origins requirement for their 5 FKH-T sites and for the FHA domain. Significantly, direct assessment of ORC-origin binding by ChIPSeq provided evidence that this mechanism affected ~25% of yeast origins. Thus, this study reveals a new mechanism to enhance ORC-origin binding in budding yeast that requires the FHA domain of the conserved cell-cycle transcription factor Fkh1.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCardiac fibroblasts are responsible for extracellular matrix turnover and repair in the cardiac environment and serve to help facilitate immune responses. However, it is well established that they have significant phenotypic heterogeneity with respect to location, physiological conditions, and developmental age. The goal of this study was to provide an in-depth transcriptomic profile of cardiac fibroblasts derived from rat hearts at fetal, neonatal, and adult developmental ages to ascertain variations in gene expression that may drive functional differences in these cells at these specific stages of development.\n\nResultsWe performed RNA-seq of cardiac fibroblasts isolated from fetal, neonatal, and adult rats was performed and compared to the rat genome. Principal component analysis of RNA-seq data suggested data variance was predominantly due to developmental age. Differential expression and Gene set enrichment analysis against Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes datasets indicated an array of differences across developmental ages, including significant decreases in cardiac development and cardiac function-associated genes with age, and a significant increase in immune and inflammatory-associated functions - particularly immune cell signaling, and cytokine and chemokine production - with respect to increasing developmental age.\n\nConclusionThese results reinforce established evidence of diverse phenotypic heterogeneity of fibroblasts with respect to developmental age. Further, based on our analysis of gene expression, age-specific alterations in cardiac fibroblasts may play a crucial role in observed differences in cardiac inflammation and immune response observed across developmental ages.",

    "abstract": "Mammalia spermatozoa are a notable example of energetic compartmentalization. While mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is restricted to the midpiece, sperm-specific glycolysis operates in the flagellum. Consequently, these highly specialized cells exhibit a clear adaptability to fuel substrates. This plasticity is essential to ensure sperm motility, and is known to vary among species. Here we describe an extreme example of spermatozoa-energetics adaptation. We show that toothed whales exhibit impaired sperm glycolysis, due to gene and exon erosion, and demonstrate that dolphin spermatozoa motility depends uniquely on endogenous fatty acid {beta}-oxidation, but not carbohydrates. Our findings substantiate the observation of large mitochondria in spermatozoa, possibly boosting ATP production from endogenous fatty acids. This unique energetic rewiring emphasizes the physiological body reorganisation imposed by the carbohydrate-depleted marine environment.",

    "abstract": "The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay has emerged as one of the most popular methods for analysing protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in plant biology. This includes its increasing use as a tool for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of chloroplast function. However, the construction of chloroplast fusion proteins for BiFC can be difficult, and the availability and selection of appropriate controls is not trivial. Furthermore, the challenges of performing BiFC in restricted cellular compartments has not been specifically addressed. Here we describe the development of a flexible modular cloning-based toolkit (MoBiFC) for chloroplast BiFC and proximity labelling using synthetic biology principles. The approach facilitates the cloning process for chloroplast-targeted proteins, allows robust ratiometric quantification, and the toolkit comes with model positive and negative controls. Our study also highlights many potential pitfalls including the choice of fluorescent protein (FP) split, negative controls, cell type, and reference FP. Finally, we provide an example of how users can enrich the toolset by providing functional proximity labelling modules, and we discuss how MoBiFC could be further improved and extended to other compartments of the plant cell.",

    "abstract": "The spatial distribution of dengue and its vectors (spp. Aedes) may be the widest it has ever been, and projections suggest that climate change may allow the expansion to continue. However, the largest impacts of climate change on dengue might be in regions where the pathogen is already endemic. In these areas, the waxing and waning of immunity has a large impact on temporal dynamics of cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever. Here, we use 51 years of data across 72 provinces and characterise spatio-temporal patterns of dengue in Thailand, where dengue has caused almost 1.5 million cases over the last thirty years, and examine the roles played by temperature and dynamics of immunity in giving rise to those patterns. We find that timescales of multiannual oscillations in dengue vary in space and time and uncover an interesting spatial phenomenon: Thailand has experienced multiple, periodic synchronization events. We show that patterns in synchrony of dengue are consistent with those observed in temperature. Applying a temperature-driven dengue model, we explore how dynamics of immunity interact with temperature to produce the observed multiannual dynamics and patterns in synchrony. While multiannual oscillations are readily produced by immunity in absence of multiannual timescales in temperature, synchrony in temperature can synchronise dengue dynamics in different locations. However, at higher mean temperatures and lower seasonal variation, immune dynamics become more predominant, and dengue dynamics become more insensitive to multiannual fluctuations in temperature. These findings can help underpin predictions of disease patterns as global temperatures rise.\n\nAuthor summary",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TE) are an important source of genetic variation with a dynamic and content that greatly differ in a wide range of species. The origin of the intraspecific content variation is not always clear and little is known about the precise nature of it. Here, we surveyed the species-wide content of the Ty LTR-retrotransposons in a broad collection of 1,011 Saccharomyces cerevisiae natural isolates to understand what can stand behind the variation of the repertoire, i.e. the type and number of Ty elements. We have compiled an exhaustive catalog of all TE variants present in the S. cerevisiae species by identifying a large set of new variants. The characterization of the TE content in each isolate clearly highlighted that each subpopulation exhibits a unique and specific repertoire, retracing the evolutionary history of the species. Most interestingly, we have shown that ancient interspecific hybridization events had a major impact in the birth of new variants and therefore in the shaping of the TE repertoires. We also investigated the transpositional activity of these elements in a large set of natural isolates, and we found a broad variability related to the level of ploidy as well as the genetic background. Overall, our results pointed out that the evolution of the Ty content is deeply impacted by clade-specific events such as introgressions and therefore follows the population structure. In addition, our study lays the foundation for future investigations to better understand the transpositional regulation and more broadly the TE-host interactions.\n\nAuthors summaryMobile DNA elements are widely distributed in the genomes of many eukaryotes, but their contents greatly vary between species, populations and even individuals. In fact, little is known about the origin of this variation of transposable element (TE) content across individuals of the same species. Here, we surveyed the Ty LTR-retrotransposon content in a broad collection of 1,011 Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast natural isolates. We have defined an exhaustive and precise catalog of the TE variants present in the S. cerevisiae species. We found that the TE content follows the evolutionary history of the species because each subpopulation has a unique and specific content. Interestingly, our results highlighted that ancient interspecific hybridization events led to the appearance of new TE variants and therefore had a strong impact on the variation of the TE repertoires in this species. We also investigated the transpositional activity of these elements and found a wide variability related to the genetic background diversity. Altogether, our results have led to a better understanding of the variability of TE content at a species level.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in advancing preclinical studies is the lack of robust in vitro culture systems that fully recapitulate the in vivo scenario together with limited clinical translational to humans. Organoids, as 3-dimensional (3D) self-replicating structures are increasingly being shown as powerful models for ex vivo experimentation in the field of regenerative medicine and drug discovery. Organoid formation requires the use of extracellular matrix (ECM) components to provide a 3D platform. However, the most commonly used ECM, essential for maintaining organoid growth is Matrigel and is derived from a tumorigenic source which limits its translational ability. PeptiGels(R) which are self-assembling peptide hydrogels present as alternatives to traditional ECM for use in 3D culture systems. Synthetic PeptiGels(R) are non-toxic, biocompatible, biodegradable and can be tuneable to simulate different tissue microenvironments. In this study, we validated the use of different types of PeptiGels(R) for porcine hepatic organoid growth. Hepatic organoids were assessed morphologically and using molecular techniques to determine the optimum PeptiGel(R) formulation. The outcome clearly demonstrated the ability of PeptiGel(R) to support organoid growth and offer themselves as a technological platform for 3D cultured physiologically and clinically relevant data.",

Our previous study showed NDRG1, which could suppress cell invasion and migration, was frequently down-regulated by DNA methylation of its promoter in GC.\n\nPurpose and MethodsTo analyze the relationship between the expression and DNA methylation of NDRG1 and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) family. We performed a comprehensive comparison analysis using 407 patients including sequencing analysis data of GC from TCGA.\n\nResultsNDRG1 was negatively correlative to DNMT1 (p =0.03), DNMT3A(p =0.01), DNMT3B(p =0.88), respectively. Whereas, the DNA methylation of NDRG1 was positively correlative to DNMT family(DNMT1 p<0.01, DNMT3A p<0.001, DNMT3B p=0.57, respectively). NDRG1 expression was significantly inverse correlated with invasion depth (p =0.023), and DNMT1 was significantly positive correlated with the degree of tumor cell differentiation (p =0.049). DNMT3B was significantly correlated with tumor cell differentiation (p =0.030). However, there was no association between the expression of DNMT3A and clinicopathological features. The univariate analysis showed that NDRG1and DNMTs had no association with prognosis of GC patients. But, multivariate analysis showed DNMT1 was significantly correlated with prognosis of GC patients.\n\nConclusionThese data suggest that down-regulation of NDRG1 in gastric cancer is due to DNA methylation of NDRG1 gene promoter via DNMT family. The demethylating agent maybe a potential target drug for GC patients.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundContemporary research suggests that the optimal timing of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) should be based upon an individual time in which bicarbonate (HCO3-) or pH peaks within the blood. However, the mechanisms surrounding acidosis on exercise performance are contested, therefore it is plausible that the ergogenic effects of NaHCO3 are instead a result of an increased strong ion difference (SID) following ingestion. Since the post-ingestion time course of the SID is currently unknown, the purpose of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of the SID in direct comparison to HCO3- and pH.\n\nMethodsTwelve highly trained, adolescent swimmers (age: 15.9 {+/-} 1.0 yrs, body mass: 65.3 {+/-} 9.6 kg) consumed their typical pre-competition nutrition before ingesting 0.3 g{middle dot}kg BM-1 NaHCO3 in gelatine capsules. Capillary blood samples were then taken during quiet, seated rest on nine occasions (0, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, and 165 min post-ingestion) for the assessment of time course changes in HCO3-, pH, and the SID.\n\nResultsOn a group mean level, no differences were found in the time in which each variable peaked within the blood (HCO3- = 130 {+/-} 35 min, pH = 120 {+/-} 38 min, SID = 96 {+/-} 35 min; p = 0.06). A large effect size was calculated between the timing of peak HCO3- and the SID (g = 0.91), however, suggesting that a difference may occur between these two measures in practice.\n\nConclusionsA time difference between peak HCO3- and the SID presents an interesting avenue for further research since an approach based upon individual increases in extracellular SID has yet to be investigated. Future studies should therefore compare these dosing strategies directly to elucidate whether either one is more ergogenic for exercise performance.",

Recombinant ISRAA protein was used to stimulate astrocyte cultures. Immunohistochemistry and ELISA were utilized to measure ISRAA and IFN-{gamma} levels, IFN-{gamma}R expression and STAT1 nuclear translocation. MTT-assay was used to evaluate cellular survival and proliferation. To assess astrocyte cell lysates and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, SDS-PAGE and western blot were used. ISRAA was highly expressed in mouse embryonic astrocytes, depending on cell age. Astrocytes aged seven days (E7) showed increased proliferation and diminished differentiation, while 21-day-old (E21) astrocytes depicted reversed effects. ISRAA stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous cellular proteins and the nuclear translocation of STAT1. IFN-{gamma} was involved in the ISRAA action as ISRAA induced IFN-{gamma} in both age groups, but only E21 astrocytes expressed IFN-{gamma}R.

Cell shape is largely determined by the control of cell wall growth at these hyphal tips. The Ser/Thr protein kinase AfsK is involved in controlling polar growth and directly phosphorylates DivIVA. Here, we identify a protein phosphatase in Streptomyces coelicolor, SppA, that dephosphorylates DivIVA in vivo and in vitro and affects growth and cell shape. An sppA mutant shows reduced rate of hyphal tip extension, altered hyphal branching patterns, and exhibits frequent spontaneous hyphal growth arrests, all contributing to the unusually dense mycelial structure and slow growth rate that characterize sppA mutants. These phenotypes are largely suppressed in an afsK sppA double mutant, showing that AfsK and SppA partially affect the same regulatory pathway and share target proteins that are involved control of polar growth in S. coelicolor. Strains with a non-phosphorylatable mutant DivIVA were constructed and confirm that the effect of afsK on hyphal branching during normal growth is mediated by DivIVA phosphorylation. However, the phenotypic effects of sppA deletion are independent of DivIVA phosphorylation and must be mediated via other substrates. Altogether, this study identifies a PPP-family protein phosphatase directly involved in the control of polar growth and cell shape determination in S. coelicolor and underscore the importance of eukaryotic-type Ser/Thr phosphorylation in regulation of growth and cell envelope biogenesis in Actinobacteria.\n\nAuthor summaryGram-positive bacteria often use eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr protein phosphorylation in the regulation of central processes related to growth and cell cycle progression. Members of the Actinobacteria, including pathogenic mycobacteria and antibiotic-producing streptomycetes, exhibit a distinctive mode of polar growth, with cell wall synthesis being restricted to zones at cell poles and directed by the essential cell polarity determinant DivIVA. Previously, we have shown that Streptomyces coelicolor modulates its machinery for polar growth and cell shape determination via the Ser/Thr kinase AfsK, which phosphorylates DivIVA. Here, we identify a phosphoprotein phosphatase that targets DivIVA and reverses the AfsK-mediated phosphorylation. We show that this phosphatase has strong effects on polar growth and cell shape, including hyphal branching and the rate of tip extension. The effects are to a large extent dependent on the kinase AfsK but do not require DivIVA phosphorylation as such. The results identify a new regulator of polar growth in streptomycetes, and highlight the importance of Ser/Thr phosphorylation in regulation of actinobacterial growth and cell shape determination.",

    "abstract": "A critical step in the HIV-1 replication cycle is the assembly of Gag proteins to form virions at the plasma membrane. Virion assembly and maturation is facilitated by the cellular polyanion inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), which is proposed to stabilize both the immature Gag lattice and the mature capsid lattice by binding to rings of primary amines at the center of Gag or capsid protein (CA) hexamers. The amino acids comprising these rings are critical for proper virion formation and their substitution results in assembly deficits or impaired infectiousness. To better understand the nature of the deficits that accompany IP6-deficiency, we passaged HIV-1 mutants that had substitutions in IP6-coordinating residues to select for compensatory mutations. We found a mutation, a threonine to isoleucine substitution at position 371 (T371I) in Gag, that restored replication competence to an IP6-binding-deficient HIV-1 mutant. Notably, unlike wild-type HIV-1, the assembly and infectiousness of resulting virus was not impaired when IP6 biosynthetic enzymes were genetically ablated. Surprisingly, we also found that the maturation inhibitor Bevirimat (BVM) could restore the assembly and replication of an IP6-binding deficient mutant. Moreover, using BVM-dependent mutants we were able to image the BVM-inducible assembly of individual HIV-1 particles assembly in living cells. Overall these results suggest that IP6-Gag and Gag-Gag contacts are finely tuned to generate a Gag lattice of optimal stability, and that under certain conditions BVM can functionally replace IP6.\n\nAuthor SummaryA key step in HIV-1 replication is the assembly of virions that are released from the infected cell. Previous work has suggested that a small molecule called IP6 is critical role in this process, promoting both HIV-1 assembly and the stability of mature fully infectious virions. Since IP6 is required for multiple steps in HIV-1 assembly and maturation, it is a candidate for the development of anti-retroviral therapies. Here, we identify an HIV-1 mutant that replicates independently of IP6, and show that a different small molecule can functionally substitute for IP6 under certain conditions. These findings suggest that IP6 regulates the stability of protein interactions during virion assembly and that the precise degree stability of these interactions is finely tuned and important for generating infectious virions. Finally, our work identifies an inducible virion assembly system that can be utilized to visualize HIV-1 assembly events using live cell microscopy.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is a major constituent of the extracellular matrix of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms and its release is regulated via the pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) dependent quorum sensing (QS). By screening a P. aeruginosa transposon library to identify factors required for DNA release, mutants with insertions in the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway were identified as exhibiting reduced eDNA release, and defective biofilm architecture with enhanced susceptibility to tobramycin. P. aeruginosa tat mutants showed substantial reductions in pyocyanin, rhamnolipid and membrane vesicle (MV) production consistent with perturbation of 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone (PQS) dependent QS as demonstrated by changes in pqsA expression and 2-alkyl-4-quinolone (AQ) production. Provision of exogenous PQS to the tat mutants did not return pqsA, rhlA or phzA1 expression or pyocyanin production to wild type levels. However, transformation of the tat mutants with the AQ-independent pqs effector pqsE restored phzA1 expression and pyocyanin production. Since mutation or inhibition of Tat prevented PQS-driven auto-induction, we sought to identify the Tat secretion substrate responsible. A pqsA::lux fusion was introduced into each of 34 validated P. aeruginosa Tat substrate deletion mutants. Analysis of each mutant for reduced bioluminescence revealed that the signalling defect was associated with the Rieske iron-sulfur subunit of the cytochrome bc1 complex. In common with the parent strain, a Rieske mutant exhibited defective PQS signalling, AQ production, rhlA expression and eDNA release that could be restored by genetic complementation. Thus, lack of the Rieske sub-unit export is clearly responsible for the Tat-mediated perturbation of PQS-dependent QS, the loss of virulence factor production, biofilm eDNA and the tobramycin tolerance of P. aeruginosa biofilms.\n\nAuthor SummaryPseudomonas aeruginosa is a highly adaptable human pathogen responsible for causing chronic biofilm-associated infections. Biofilms are highly refractory to host defences and antibiotics and thus difficult to eradicate. The biofilm extracellular matrix incorporates extracellular DNA (eDNA). This stabilizes biofilm architecture and helps confer tolerance to antibiotics. Since mechanisms that control eDNA release are not well understood, we screened a P. aeruginosa mutant bank for strains with defects in eDNA release and discovered a role for the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway that exports folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. Perturbation of the Tat pathway resulted in defective biofilms susceptible to antibiotic treatment as a consequence of perturbed pseudomonas quinolone (PQS) signalling. This resulted in the failure to produce or release biofilm components including eDNA, phenazines and rhamnolipids as well as microvesicles. Furthermore, we discovered that perturbation of PQS signalling was a consequence of the inability of tat mutants to translocate the Rieske subunit of the cytochrome bc1 complex involved in electron transfer and energy transduction. Given the importance of PQS signalling and the Tat system to virulence and biofilm maturation in P. aeruginosa, our findings underline the potential of the Tat system as a drug target for novel antimicrobial agents.",

    "abstract": "People around the world are currently affected by Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Despite its many aspects, symptoms, manifestations and impacts, efforts have been made to identify the root causes of the disorder. In particular, genetic studies have concentrated on identifying candidate genes for MDD and exploring associations between these genes and some specific group of individuals. The aim of this research was to find out the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in 6 candidate genes linked to the neurobiology of major depressive disorder in the North-Western population of Pakistan. We performed a case-control analysis, with 400 MDD and 232 controls. A trained psychiatrist or clinical psychologists evaluated the patients. Six polymorphisms were genotyped and tested for allele and genotype association with MDD. There were no statistical variations between MDD patients and healthy controls for genotypic and allelic distribution of all the polymorphisms observed. Thus, our analysis does not support the major role of these polymorphisms in contributing to MDD susceptibility, although it does not preclude minor impact. The statistically significant correlation between six polymorphisms and major depressive disorder in the studied population was not observed. There are inconsistencies in investigations around the world. Future research, including GWAS and association analysis on larger scale should be addressed for further validation and replication of the present findings.",

The impact of those mutations was also investigated using various in silico approaches. Among these 32 mutations in S, 15 in RdRp, and 3 in 3CLpro proteins are found to be deleterious in nature and could alter the structural and functional behavior of the encoded proteins. D614G mutation in spike and P323L in RdRp are the globally dominant variants with a high frequency. Most of them have also been found in the binding moiety of the viral proteins which determine their critical involvement in the host-pathogen interactions and drug targets.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the association between concentrations of progesterone (P4) during previous the estrous cycle with the intensity of spontaneous or estrogen-induced estrous expression and pregnancy per artificial insemination (P/AI). A total of 1,953 AI events from lactating Holstein cows were used, consisting of 1,289 timed AI events from experiment 1 (Exp. 1) and 664 AI events from experiment 2 (Exp. 2). In Exp. 1, cows were bred after a timed AI protocol based on estradiol and P4. In Exp. 2 animals were bred upon spontaneous estrus detection. In both experiments cows were continuously monitored by an automated activity monitor (AAM). The intensity of estrous expression was determined for each event and classified as either high or low intensity using the median of each experiment. Blood samples were collected for P4 analysis in Exp. 1 at -4 d, 0 d, and 7 d relative to timed AI, and in Exp. 2 immediately following estrus (0 d), 7 d, 14 d, and 21 d post-AI. Concentration of P4 was classified as greater or lower according to the median value in each experiment. Cows with lower concentrations of P4 at AI had greater estrous expression in Exp. 1 (363.6 {+/-} 5.2 vs. 275.9 {+/-} 8.0 % relative increase) and Exp. 2 (76.7 {+/-} 1.9 vs. 67.4 {+/-} 4.7 index; and 12.5 {+/-} 0.5 vs. 9.3 {+/-} 1.8 h). Cows with a greater intensity of estrous expression at timed AI had greater concentrations of P4 at -4 d than cows with lower intensity estrus or no estrous expression (4.6 {+/-} 0.2 vs. 3.6 {+/-} 0.2 vs. 3.7 {+/-} 0.2 ng/mL). Cows with greater concentrations of P4 at -4 d had greater P/AI (32.8 {+/-} 4.4 vs. 22.4 {+/-} 4.5 %), whereas cows with lesser concentrations of P4 at d0 for either timed AI (35.2 {+/-} 3.4 vs. 19.6 {+/-} 4.6 %) or spontaneous estrus (31.8 {+/-} 2.8 vs. 23.4 {+/-} 3.2 %) had greater P/AI. Cows with greater concentrations of P4 7 d post-timed AI had greater P/AI compared with cows that had lower concentration of P4 (39.1 {+/-} 2.9 vs. 24.7 {+/-} 2.6 %). Similarly, cows that had lower concentrations of P4 at 7 d, 14 d and 21 d post-spontaneous estrus tended to have lower P/AI when compared with cows with greater concentrations of P4. Overall, concentrations of P4 prior to and at AI were associated with greater estrous intensity and P/AI at both spontaneous and timed AI events.",

We found that the cognitive control and attentional networks were the most recruited structures in information transfers during both encoding and retrieval processes; these networks were correlated with task-evoked activation. Differences in information transfer intensity between encoding and retrieval mainly existed in the visual, somatomotor and hippocampal systems. Furthermore, information transfer showed high predictive power for episodic memory ability and mediated relationships between task-evoked activation and memory performance. Additional analysis indicated that structural connectivity had a transportive role in information transfer.

    "abstract": "In the host lung, the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans undergoes a morphological switch from small haploid yeast to large polyploid titan cell, contributing to C. neoformans virulence. Titan cells are less readily phagocytosed and can survive host nitrosative and oxidative stresses. We and others previously showed that titanization is triggered by host-relevant signals including CO2 and lung-resident bacteria, and addition of these factor is sufficient to induce titan cells in vitro. Here we investigate the molecular mechanisms that drive this transition and demonstrate that host-derived immune signals can increase the degree and frequency of titanization. Specifically, host-relevant reactive nitrogen species increase the accumulation of endogenous superoxide within cryptococcal cells, particularly within nuclei, where it can cause genotoxic stress. Consistent with this, we observe the accumulation of Rad51 protein, a marker of the double strand break repair pathway, in titanizing cultures. Blocking superoxide accumulation inhibits titanization, yet titanization also requires superoxide detoxification through Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity. Loss of mitochondrial Sod2 activity locks cells in the yeast phase, while Sod1 is required for the production of viable titan daughter cells. We hypothesize that the redox responsive transcription factor Yap1 in part mediates this response by regulating SOD2/SOD1. In addition, we show that Sod1 translocates to the nucleus, where it is likely involved in the detoxification of genotoxic superoxide. Together, these findings reveal a major new regulatory mechanism for the yeast-to-titan transition.\n\nAuthor SummaryDuring fungal infection, host phagocytes produce reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), major determinants of infection outcome. Fungal pathogens have developed numerous strategies to neutralize and detoxify ROS, but RNS remain important effectors for infection control. In the lung, the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans can undergo a morphological switch from small haploid yeast to large highly polyploid titan cells with increased ROS/RNS stress resistance, and the capacity to produce haploid or aneuploid daughters. Here, we report that RNS are a major signal driving the frequency and degree of titanization and act by increasing endogenous ROS within the fungus. We show that the accumulation of endogenous ROS is required for the yeast-to-titan transition, and is associated with increased genotoxic stress leading to polyploidy. Yet, failure to detoxify this ROS, either in mutants defective in Superoxide Dismutase activity or the oxidative stress response protein Yap1, impairs titan cell budding and reduces progeny viability. Therefore, the interface of exogenous RNS and endogenous ROS regulation during host-pathogen interaction represents an Achilles heel for this major human fungal pathogen.",

Interestingly, one pair of RCM in zip-2 is highly conserved across five nematode ortholog genes, which show conserved exon-skipping patterns.

    "abstract": "Nelfinavir is one of the FDA approved HIV-1 protease inhibitors and is a part of HAART therapy for the treatment of HIV-AIDS. Nelfinavir was the first HIV-1 protease inhibitor to be approved as a Paediatric formulation. The application of HAART had resulted into significant improvement in the life of AIDS patients. However, emergence of drug resistance in HIV-1 protease limited the use of many of these drugs including nelfinavir. A unique mutation observed frequently in patients treated with nelfinavir is D30N as it is selected exclusively by nelfinavir. It imparts very high resistance to nelfinavir but unlike other primary mutations does not give cross resistance to the majority of other drugs. D30N mutation also significantly reduces cleavage activity of HIV-1 protease and affects the viral fitness. Here, we have determined structures of D30N HIV-1 protease in unliganded form and in complex with the drug nelfinavir. These structures provide rationale for reduced cleavage activity and molecular basis of resistance induced by D30N mutation. The loss of coulombic interaction part of a crucial hydrogen bond between the drug and the enzyme, is a likely explanation for reduced affinity and drug resistance towards nelfinavir. The decreased catalytic activity of D30N HIV protease, due to altered interaction with substrates and reduced stability of folding core may be the reasons for reduced replicative capacity of the HIV harboring D30N HIV-1 protease.",

    "abstract": "MotivationTumour heterogeneity is being increasingly recognised as an important characteristic of cancer and as a determinant of prognosis and treatment outcome. Emerging spatial transcriptomics data hold the potential to further our understanding of tumour heterogeneity and its implications. However, existing statistical tools are not sufficiently powerful to capture heterogeneity in the complex setting of spatial molecular biology.\n\nResultsWe provide a statistical solution, the HeTerogeneity Average index (HTA), specifically designed to handle the multivariate nature of spatial transcriptomics. We prove that HTA has an approximately normal distribution, therefore lending itself to efficient statistical assessment and inference. We first demonstrate that HTA accurately reflects the level of heterogeneity in simulated data. We then use HTA to analyse heterogeneity in two cancer spatial transcriptomics datasets: spatial RNA sequencing by 10x Genomics and spatial transcriptomics inferred from H&E. Finally, we demonstrate that HTA also applies to 3D spatial data using brain MRI. In spatial RNA sequencing we use a known combination of molecular traits to assert that HTA aligns with the expected outcome for this combination. We also show that HTA captures immune-cell infiltration at multiple resolutions. In digital pathology we show how HTA can be used in survival analysis and demonstrate that high levels of heterogeneity may be linked to poor survival. In brain MRI we show that HTA differentiates between normal ageing, Alzheimers disease and two tumours. HTA also extends beyond molecular biology and medical imaging, and can be applied to many domains, including GIS.\n\nAvailability<attached; publicly available upon acceptance>.\n\nContactlevyalona@gmail.com zohar.yakhini@gmail.com\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "In the physicists perspective, epithelial tissues constitute an exotic type of active matter with non-linear properties reminiscent of amorphous materials. In the context of a circular proliferating epithelium, modeled by the quasistatic vertex model, we identify novel discrete tissue scale rearrangements, i.e. cellular flow avalanches, which are a form of collective cell movement. During the avalanches, the cellular trajectories are radial in the periphery and form a vortex in the core. After the onset of these avalanches, the epithelial area grows discontinuously. The avalanches are found to be stochastic, and their strength is determined by the density of cells in the tissue. Overall, avalanches regularize the spatial tension distribution along tissue. Furthermore, the avalanche distribution is found to obey a power law, with an exponent consistent with sheer induced avalanches in amorphous materials. To decipher the role of avalanches in organ development, we simulate epithelial growth of the Drosophila eye disc during the third instar using a computational model, which includes both signaling and mechanistic signalling. During the third instar, the morphogenetic furrow (MF), a [~]10 cell wide wave of apical area constriction propagates through the epithelium, making it a system with interesting mechanical properties. These simulations are used to understand the details of the growth process, the effect of the MF on the growth dynamics on the tissue scale, and to make predictions. The avalanches are found to depend on the strength of the apical constriction of cells in the MF, with stronger apical constriction leading to less frequent and more pronounced avalanches. The results herein highlight the dependence of simulated tissue growth dynamics on relaxation timescales, and serve as a guide for in vitro experiments.",

    "abstract": "Despite the introduction of public health measures and spike protein-based vaccines to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infections and deaths continue to rise. Previously, we used a structural design approach to develop picomolar range miniproteins targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain. Here, we investigated the capacity of modified versions of one lead binder, LCB1, to protect against SARS-CoV-2-mediated lung disease in human ACE2-expressing transgenic mice. Systemic administration of LCB1-Fc reduced viral burden, diminished immune cell infiltration and inflammation, and completely prevented lung disease and pathology. A single intranasal dose of LCB1v1.3 reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung even when given as many as five days before or two days after virus inoculation. Importantly, LCB1v1.3 protected in vivo against a historical strain (WA1/2020), an emerging B.1.1.7 strain, and a strain encoding key E484K and N501Y spike protein substitutions. These data support development of LCB1v1.3 for prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Differences in gene expression, which can arise from divergence in cis-regulatory elements or alterations in transcription factors binding specificity, are one of the most important causes of phenotypic diversity during evolution. By protein sequence analysis, we observed high sequence conservation in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the transcription factor Cdx2 across many vertebrates, whereas three amino acid changes were exclusively found in mouse Cdx2 (mCdx2), suggesting potential positive selection in the mouse lineage. Multi-omics analyses were then carried out to investigate the effects of these changes. Surprisingly, there were no significant functional differences between mCdx2 and its rat homologue (rCdx2), and none of the three amino acid changes had any impact on its function. Finally, we used rat-mouse allodiploid embryonic stem cells (RMES) to study the cis effects of Cdx2-mediated gene regulation between the two rodents. Interestingly, whereas Cdx2 binding is largely divergent between mouse and rat, the transcriptional effect induced by Cdx2 is conserved to a much larger extent.\n\nAuthor summaryOur study 1) represented a first systematic analysis of species-specific adaptation in DNA binding pattern of transcription factor. Although the mouse-specific amino acid changes did not manifest functional impact in our system, several explanations may account for it (See Discussion part for the detail); 2) represented a first study of cis-regulation between two reproductively isolated species by using a novel allodiploid system; 3) demonstrated a higher conservation of transcriptional output than that of DNA binding, suggesting the evolvability/plasticity of the latter; 4) finally provided a rich data resource for Cdx2 mediated regulation, including gene expression, chromatin accessibility and DNA binding etc.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat to health and healthcare. In response to the growing AMR burden, research funding also increased. However, a comprehensive overview of the research output, including conceptual, temporal, and geographical trends, is missing. Therefore, this study uses topic modelling, a machine learning approach, to reveal the scientific evolution of AMR research and its trends, and provides an interactive user interface for further analyses.\n\nMethodsStructural topic modelling (STM) was applied on a text corpus resulting from a PubMed query comprising AMR articles (1999-2018). A topic network was established and topic trends were analysed by frequency, proportion, and importance over time and space.\n\nFindingsIn total, 88 topics were identified in 158616 articles from 166 countries. AMR publications increased by 450% between 1999 and 2018, emphasizing the vibrancy of the field. Prominent topics in 2018 were Strategies for emerging resistances and diseases, Nanoparticles, and Stewardship. Emerging topics included Water and environment, and Sequencing. Geographical trends showed prominence of Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the WHO African Region, corresponding with the MDR-TB burden. China and India were growing contributors in recent years, following the United States of America as overall lead contributor.\n\nInterpretationThis study provides a comprehensive overview of the AMR research output thereby revealing the AMR research response to the increased AMR burden. Both the results and the publicly available interactive database serve as a base to inform and optimise future research.\n\nFundingINTERREG-VA EurHealth-1Health (202085); European Commission Horizon 2020 Framework\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPrior to this study, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore were queried to find studies providing a conceptual overview of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) research over time and space. The search string included keywords (\"antimicrobial\" OR antibiotic*) AND (resistan*) AND (\"science mapping\" OR bibliometric OR scientometric) in the title and abstract and focused on articles published before 2019 without language restrictions. Few studies were found relying on scientometric and bibliometric methods to assess either subfields of AMR research (e.g., AMR among uropathogens) or AMR-related fields (e.g., microbiology). No studies were found that focus on the entire AMR field. Therefore, this science mapping study using topic modelling was performed to provide an overview of the AMR field by identifying and assessing topics, trends, and geographical differences over time.\n\nAdded value of this studyTo the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use a science mapping approach to provide a comprehensive overview of the entire AMR research field, covering over 150 thousand articles published between 1999 and 2018. Our findings revealed important (e.g., Strategies for emerging resistances and diseases, Nanoparticles, and Stewardship) and emerging (e.g., Water and environment, and Sequencing) topics in AMR research. Lastly, this study resulted in an interactive user interface where all data are presented for further analyses.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceOur comprehensive overview of the AMR field, including its conceptual structure, and temporal and geographical trends revealed the response of the research community to the AMR burden. The results and the openly available supporting data provide the base to guide future funding and research directions to tackle AMR.",

    "abstract": "Bats are highly gregarious animals, displaying a large spectrum of social systems with different organizational structures. One important factor shaping sociality is group stability. To maintain group cohesion and stability, bats often rely on social vocal communication. The Honduran white bat, Ectophylla alba exhibits an unusual social structure compared to other tent-roosting species. This small white-furred bat lives in perennial stable mixed-sex groups. Tent construction requires several individuals and, as the only tent roosting species so far, involves both sexes. The bats social system and ecology render this species an interesting candidate to study social behaviour and social vocal communication. In our study, we investigated the social behaviour and vocalizations of E. alba in the tent by observing two stable groups, including pups, in the wild. We documented 16 different behaviours, among others, play and fur chewing, a behaviour presumably used for scent-marking. Moreover, we found 10 distinct social call types in addition to echolocation calls, and, for seven call types, we were able to identify the corresponding behavioural context. Most of the social call types were affiliative, including two types of contact calls, maternal directives, pup isolation calls and a call type related to the fur-chewing behaviour. In sum, this study entails an ethogram and describes the first vocal repertoire of a tent-roosting phyllostomid bat, providing the basis for further in-depth studies about the sociality and vocal communication in E. alba.",
