    "abstract": "Knowledge curation from the biomedical literature is very valuable but can be a repetitive and laborious process. The paucity of user-friendly tools is one of the reasons for the lack of widespread adoption of good biomedical knowledge curation practices.

    "abstract": "Univariate and multivariate methods for association of the genomic variations with the end-or-endo phenotype have been widely used for genome wide association studies. In addition to encoding the SNPs, we advocate usage of clustering as a novel method to encode the structural variations, SVs, in genomes, such as the deletions and insertions polymorphism (DIPs), Copy Number Variations (CNVs), translocation, inversion, etc., that can be used as an independent feature variable value for downstream computation by artificial intelligence methods to predict the endo-or-end phenotype. We introduce a clustering based encoding scheme for structural variations and omics based analysis. We conducted a complete all genomic variants association with the phenotype using deep learning and other machine learning techniques, though other methods such as genetic algorithm can also be applied. Applying this encoding of SVs and one-hot encoding of SNPs on GTEx V7 pilot DNA variation dataset, we were able to get high accuracy using various methods of DMWAS, and particularly found logistic regression to work the best for death due to heart-attack (MHHRTATT) phenotype. The genomic variants acting as feature sets were then arranged in descending order of power of impact on the disease or trait phenotype, which we call optimization and that also uses top univariate association into account. Variant Id P1_M_061510_3_402_P at chromosome 3 & position 192063195 was found to be most highly associated to MHHRTATT. We present here the top ten optimized genomic variant feature set for the MHHRTATT phenotypic cause of death.",

Here we combine an ingestible, minimally invasive capsule with surface electrogastrography to probe if gut physiology correlates with bodily self-consciousness during a virtual bodily illusion. We discover that specific patterns of stomach and bowel activity (temperature, pressure, pH, and gastric peak frequency) covary with specific facets of bodily self-consciousness (feelings of body agency, location, and disembodiment). These results uncover the hitherto untapped potential of minimally invasive probes to study the link between mental and gut states, and reveal a deep visceral pathway to the self-conscious perception of ourselves as embodied beings.",

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are among the most extensively characterised mycobionts to date. Current approaches to quantifying the extent of root colonisation and the abundance of hyphal structures in mutant roots rely on staining and human scoring involving simple, yet repetitive tasks prone to variations between experimenters.\n\nWe developed AMFinder which allows for automatic computer vision-based identification and quantification of AM fungal colonisation and intraradical hyphal structures on ink-stained root images using convolutional neural networks.\n\nAMFinder delivered high-confidence predictions on image datasets of roots of multiple plant hosts (Nicotiana benthamiana, Medicago truncatula, Lotus japonicus, Oryza sativa) and captured the altered colonisation in ram1-1, str and smax1 mutants. A streamlined protocol for sample preparation and imaging allowed us to quantify mycobionts from the genera Rhizophagus, Claroideoglomus, Rhizoglomus and Funneliformis via flatbed scanning or digital microscopy including dynamic increases in colonisation in whole root systems over time.\n\nAMFinder adapts to a wide array of experimental conditions. It enables accurate, reproducible analyses of plant root systems and will support better documentation of AM fungal colonisation analyses.

    "abstract": "AimsIntermittent fasting (IF) reduces cardiovascular risk factors in animals and humans, and can protect the heart against ischemic injury in models of myocardial infarction, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. To delineate molecular and cellular adaptations of the heart to IF, we carried out system-wide comprehensive analyses of proteome and phosphoproteome, complemented with transcriptome profiling, followed by functional analysis.\n\nMethods and resultsIn order to understand molecular and cellular remodeling of the heart during IF, we employed advanced mass spectrometry for system-wide profiling of the proteome and phosphoproteome of heart tissues obtained from mice maintained for 6 months on either daily 12- or 16-hour fasting, every-other-day fasting or ad libitum control feeding regimens. We also performed transcriptome analyses using RNA sequencing to evaluate whether the observed molecular responses to IF occur at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels. IF regimens significantly affected pathways that regulate cyclic GMP signaling, lipid and amino acid metabolism, cell adhesion, cell death, and inflammation. Comparison of differentially expressed proteome and transcriptome upon IF showed the higher correlation of pathway alternation in short IF regimen but the inverse correlation of metabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation and immune processes in longer IF regimens. In addition, functional echocardiographic analyses demonstrated that IF enhances stress-induced cardiac performance.\n\nConclusionOur systematic multi-omics study elucidates a molecular framework for understanding how IF impacts the hearts function and its vulnerability to injury and disease.\n\nTranslational perspectiveIntermittent fasting is emerging as a desirable lifestyle adaptation to impact cardiovascular health through the modulation of molecular and cellular mechanisms, and by acting on disease risk factors. Evidence from numerous studies indicates that the fasting cycles are highly and consistently effective in protecting against cardiovascular diseases and improving cardiac health in animals and human. Using multi-omics, here we dissect distinct molecular adaptations of the heart to different intermittent fasting regimens. Our results unveil novel cardioprotective mechanisms and open up new avenues for innovative pharmacological approaches to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) measurements and models provide information about brain connectivity and are sensitive to the physical properties of tissue microstructure. Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) quantifies the degree of non-Gaussian diffusion in biological tissue from dMRI. These estimates are of interest because they were shown to be more sensitive to microstructural alterations in health and diseases than measures based on the total anisotropy of diffusion which are highly confounded by tissue dispersion and fiber crossings. In this work, we implemented DKI in the Diffusion in Python (DIPY) project - a large collaborative open-source project which aims to provide well-tested, well-documented and comprehensive implementation of different dMRI techniques. We demonstrate the functionality of our methods in numerical simulations with known ground truth parameters and in openly available datasets. A particular strength of our DKI implementations is that it pursues several extensions of the model that connect it explicitly with microstructural models and the reconstruction of 3D white matter fiber bundles (tractography). For instance, our implementations include DKI-based microstructural models that allow the estimation of biophysical parameters, such as axonal water fraction. Moreover, we illustrate how DKI provides more general characterization of non-Gaussian diffusion compatible with complex white matter fiber architectures and grey matter, and we include a novel mean kurtosis index that is invariant to the confounding effects due to tissue dispersion. In summary, DKI in DIPY provides a well-tested, well-documented and comprehensive reference mplementation for DKI. It provides a platform for wider use of DKI in research on brain disorders and cognitive neuroscience research. It will ease the translation of DKI advantages into clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "The adult mammalian brain entails a reservoir of neural stem cells (NSCs) generating glial cells and neurons. However, NSCs become increasingly quiescent with age, which hampers their regenerative capacity. New means are therefore required to genetically modify adult NSCs for re-enabling endogenous brain repair. Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are ideal gene therapy vectors due to an excellent safety profile and high transduction efficiency. We thus conducted a high-throughput screening of 177 intraventricularly injected barcoded AAV variants profiled by RNA sequencing. Quantification of barcoded AAV mRNAs identified two synthetic capsids, AAV9_A2 and AAV1_P5, both of which transduce active and quiescent NSCs. Further optimization of AAV1_P5 by judicious selection of promoter and dose of injected viral genomes enabled labeling of 30-60% of the NSC compartment, which was validated by FACS analyses and single cell RNA sequencing. Importantly, transduced NSC readily produced neurons. The present study identifies AAV variants with a high regional tropism towards the v-SVZ with high efficiency in targeting adult NSCs, thereby paving the way for preclinical testing of regenerative gene therapy.",

Although the protocol for seeding neural soma in these devices is well known and has been widely used in myriad studies, the accurate control of the number of neurites passing through the microchannels remains challenging. However, the regulation of axonal density among different groups of neurons is still a requirement to assess the inherent structural connectivity between neuronal populations. In this work, we report the effect of microchannel patterning strategies on the modulation of neuronal connectivity by applying dimensional modifications on microchannel-connected microfluidic chambers. Our results show that those strategies can modulate the direction and the number of neuronal projections of passage, therefore regulating the strength of the structural connections between two populations of neurons. With this approach, we provide innovative microfluidic design rules for the engineering of in vitro physiologically relevant neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) results from infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to at least rifampin or isoniazid. To improve the treatment outcome in DR-TB, therapeutic vaccines are considered an ideal choice as they can enhance pathogen clearance and minimize disease sequelae. To date, there is no therapeutic vaccine reported to be effective when combined with a chemotherapy regimen against DR-TB. The only available TB vaccine, the M. bovis BCG (BCG) is susceptible to several anti-TB drugs hence not a perfect option for therapeutic vaccination. Herein, we developed a recombinant BCG (RdrBCG) overexpressing Ag85B and Rv2628 with resistance to selected anti-TB drugs. When administered three times adjunct to a second-line anti-TB regimen in a classical murine model of DR-TB, the RdrBCG lowered lung M. tuberculosis colony-forming units by 1 log10. Furthermore, vaccination with the RdrBCG adjunct to TB chemotherapy minimized lung tissue pathology in mice. Most importantly, the RdrBCG maintained the exogenously inserted genes and showed almost the same virulence as its parent BCG Tice strain in severe combined immune-deficient mice. All these suggested that the RdrBCG was stable, safe and effective. Hence, the \"recombinant\" plus \"drug-resistant\" BCG strategy could be a useful concept for developing therapeutic vaccines against DR-TB.",

In this study, we provide evidence that the first step of BXs synthesis does indeed occur in the roots of rye seedlings. We detected ScBx1 transcripts, BX1 enzyme, and six BXs (2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one, 2,4-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one, (2R)-2-O-{beta}-d-glucopyranosyl-4-hydroxy-(2H)-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one glucoside, 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one, 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one glucoside, and 6-methoxy-2-benzoxazolinone) in the roots developed from seeds deprived of the coleoptile at 2 days after sowing (i.e., roots without contact with aerial parts). In roots regenerated in vitro, both ScBx1 transcripts and BX1 enzyme were detected at a low but still measurable levels. Thus, BXs are able to be synthesised in both the roots and above-ground parts of rye plants.\n\nHighlightThe first step benzoxazinoids synthesis occurs in both the above-ground parts and roots of rye plants.

Early insights into plant sRNAs established a role in antiviral defense and they are now extensively studied across plant-microbe interactions. Here, sRNA sequencing discovered a class of sRNA in rice (Oryza sativa) specifically associated with foliar diseases caused by Xanthomonas oryzae bacteria. Xanthomonas-induced small RNAs (xisRNAs) loci were distinctively upregulated in response to diverse virulent strains at an early stage of infection producing a single duplex of 20-22nt sRNAs. xisRNAs production was dependent on the Type III secretion system, a major bacterial virulence factor for host colonization. xisRNA loci overlap with annotated transcripts sequences often encoding protein kinase domain proteins. A number of the corresponding rice cis-genes have documented functions in immune signaling and some xisRNA loci coincide with the coding sequence of a conserved kinase motif. xisRNAs exhibit features of small interfering RNAs and their biosynthesis depend on canonical components OsDCL1 and OsHEN1. xisRNA induction possibly mediates post-transcriptional gene silencing but they do not broadly suppress cis-genes expression on the basis of mRNA-seq data. Overall, our results identify a group of unusual sRNAs with a potential role in plant-microbe interactions.",

The limb complexity resembles that of humans in structure and tissue components; however, axolotl limbs develop post-embryonically. In this work, we evaluated the post-embryonic development of the appendicular skeleton and its changes with aging.\n\nResultsThe juvenile limb skeleton is formed mostly by Sox9/Col1a2 cartilage cells. Ossification of the appendicular skeleton starts when animals reach a length of 10 cm, and cartilage cells are replaced by a primary ossification center, consisting of cortical bone and an adipocyte-filled marrow cavity. Vascularization is associated with the ossification center and the marrow cavity formation. We identified the contribution of Col1a2-descendants to bone and adipocytes. Moreover, ossification progresses with age towards the epiphyses of long bones. Axolotls are neotenic salamanders, and still ossification remains responsive to L-thyroxine, increasing the rate of bone formation.\n\nConclusionsIn axolotls, bone maturation is a continuous process that extends throughout their life. Ossification of the appendicular bones is slow and continues until the complete element is ossified. The cellular components of the appendicular skeleton change accordingly during ossification, creating a heterogenous landscape in each element. The continuous maturation of the bone is accompanied by a continuous body growth.",

    "abstract": "Droughts increasingly threaten the worlds forests and their potential to mitigate climate change. In 2018-2019, Central European forests were hit by two consecutive hotter drought years, an unprecedented phenomenon that is likely to occur more frequently with climate change. Here, we examine tree growth and physiological stress responses (increase in carbon isotope composition; {Delta}{delta}13C) to this consecutive drought based on tree-rings of dominant tree species in a Central European floodplain forest. Tree growth was not reduced for most species in 2018, indicating that water supply in floodplain forests can partly buffer meteorological water deficits. Drought stress responses in 2018 were comparable to former single drought years but the hotter drought in 2018 induced drought legacies in tree growth while former droughts did not. We observed strong decreases in tree growth and increases in {Delta}{delta}13C across all tree species in 2019, which are likely driven by the cumulative stress both consecutive hotter droughts exerted. Our results show that consecutive hotter droughts pose a novel threat to forests under climate change, even in forest ecosystems with comparably high levels of water supply.",

    "abstract": "Protein kinases are among the largest druggable family of signaling proteins, involved in various human diseases, including cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Despite their clinical relevance, nearly 30% of the 545 human protein kinases remain highly understudied. Comparative genomics is a powerful approach for predicting and investigating the functions of understudied kinases. However, an incomplete knowledge of kinase orthologs across fully sequenced kinomes severely limits the application of comparative approaches for illuminating understudied kinases. Here, we propose KinOrtho, a query- and graph-based orthology inference method that combines full-length and domain-based approaches to map one-to-one kinase orthologs across 17 thousand species. Using multiple metrics, we show that KinOrtho performed better than existing methods in identifying kinase orthologs across evolutionarily divergent species and eliminated potential false positives by flagging sequences without a proper kinase domain for further evaluation. We demonstrate the advantage of using domain-based approaches for identifying domain fusion events, highlighting a case between an understudied serine/threonine kinase TAOK1 and a metabolic kinase PIK3C2A with high co-expression in human cells. We also identify evolutionary fission events involving the understudied OBSCN kinase domains, further highlighting the value of domain-based orthology inference approaches. Using KinOrtho-defined orthologs, Gene Ontology annotations, and machine learning, we propose putative biological functions of several understudied kinases, including the role of TP53RK in cell cycle checkpoint(s), the involvement of TSSK3 and TSSK6 in acrosomal vesicle localization, and potential functions for the ULK4 pseudokinase in neuronal development.\n\nThe well-curated kinome ortholog set can serve as a valuable resource for illuminating understudied kinases, and the KinOrtho framework can be extended to any gene-family of interest.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomic binning enables the in-depth characterization of microorganisms. To improve the resolution and efficiency of metagenomic binning, BASALT (Binning Across a Series of AssembLies Toolkit), a novel binning toolkit was present in this study, which recovers, compares and optimizes metagenomic assembled genomes (MAGs) across a series of assemblies from short-read, long-read or hybrid strategies. BASALT incorporates self-designed algorithms which automates the separation of redundant bins, elongate and refine best bins and improve contiguity. Evaluation using mock communities revealed that BASALT auto-binning obtained up to 51% more number of MAGs with up to 10 times better MAG quality from microbial community at low (132 genomes) and medium (596 genomes) complexity, compared to other binners such as DASTool, VAMB and metaWRAP. Using BASALT, a case-study analysis of a Salt Lake sediment microbial community from northwest arid region of China was performed, resulting in 426 non-redundant MAGs, including 352 and 69 bacterial and archaeal MAGs which could not be assigned to any known species from GTDB (ANI < 95%), respectively. In addition, two Lokiarchaeotal MAGs that belong to superphylum Asgardarchaeota were observed from Salt Lake sediment samples. This is the first time that candidate species from phylum Lokiarchaeota was found in the arid and deep-inland environment, filling the current knowledge gap of earth microbiome. Overall, BASALT is proven to be a robust toolkit for metagenomic binning, and more importantly, expand the Tree of Life.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMalaria blood-stage infection length and intensity are important drivers of disease and transmission; however, the underlying mechanisms of parasite growth and the hosts immune response during infection remain largely unknown. Over the last 30 years, several mechanistic mathematical models of malaria parasite within-host dynamics have been published and used in malaria transmission models.\n\nMethodsWe identified mechanistic within-host models of parasite dynamics through a review of published literature. For a subset of these, we reproduced model code and compared descriptive statistics between the models using fitted data. Through simulation and model analysis, we compare and discuss key features of the models, including assumptions on growth, immune response components, variant switching mechanisms, and inter-individual variability.\n\nResultsThe assessed within-host malaria models generally replicate infection dynamics in malaria-naive individuals. However, there are substantial differences between the model dynamics after disease onset, and models do not always reproduce late infection parasitemia data used for calibration of the within host infections. Models have attempted to capture the considerable variability in parasite dynamics between individuals by including stochastic parasite multiplication rates; variant switching dynamics leading to immune escape; variable effects of the host immune responses; or via probabilistic events. For models that capture realistic length of infections, model representations of innate immunity explain early peaks in infection density that cause clinical symptoms, and model representations of antibody immune responses control the length of infection. Models differed in their assumptions concerning variant switching dynamics, reflecting uncertainty in the underlying mechanisms of variant switching revealed by recent clinical data during early infection. Overall, given the scarce availability of the biological evidence there is limited support for complex models.\n\nConclusionsOur study suggests that much of the inter-individual variability observed in clinical malaria infections has traditionally been attributed in models to random variability, rather than mechanistic disease dynamics. Thus, we propose that newly developed models should assume simple immune dynamics that minimally capture mechanistic understandings and avoid over-parameterisation and large stochasticity which inaccurately represent unknown disease mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Comprehensive, predictive computational models have significant potential for science, bioengineering, and medicine. One promising way to achieve more predictive models is to combine submodels of multiple subsystems. To capture the multiple scales of biology, these submodels will likely require multiple modeling frameworks and simulation algorithms. Several community resources are already available for working with many of these frameworks and algorithms. However, the variety and sheer number of these resources make it challenging to find and use appropriate tools for each model, especially for novice modelers and experimentalists. To make these resources easier to use, we developed runBioSimulations (https://run.biosimulations.org), a single web application for executing a broad range of models. runBioSimulations leverages community resources, including BioSimulators, a new open registry of simulation tools. These resources currently enable runBioSimulations to execute nine frameworks and 44 algorithms, and they make runBioSimulations extensible to additional frameworks and algorithms. runBioSimulations also provides features for sharing simulations and interactively visualizing their results. We anticipate that runBioSimulations will foster reproducibility, stimulate collaboration, and ultimately facilitate the creation of more predictive models.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-weighted neuroimaging approaches provide rich evidence with which to estimate the structural integrity of white matter in vivo. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), for instance, allows us to assess the spatial distribution of statistical tests performed on diffusion properties such as fractional anisotropy, which are proposed to reflect the integrity of white matter tracts. However, such methods do not provide a direct assessment of white matter integrity for connections between two specific regions of the brain. Here, we present a novel method for deriving tract-specific diffusion statistics, based upon arbitrarily-defined regions of interest. Our approach makes use of an empirically-derived population distribution based on probabilistic tractography, using the Nathan Kline Institute (NKI) Enhanced Rockland sample. We use a heuristic method to determine the most likely geometry of a path between two regions, if one exists, and express this as a spatial distribution. We then estimate the average orientation of streamlines traversing this path, at discrete distances along its trajectory, and compute the fraction of diffusion directed along this orientation for each participant. This allows us to obtain participant-wise metrics along the specific tract (tract-specific anisotropy; TSA), which can then be used to perform statistical analysis on any comparable population. Based on this method, we report both negative and positive associations between age and TSA for two networks derived from published meta-analytic studies (the \"default mode\" and \"what-where\" networks), along with more moderate sex differences and age-by-sex interactions in both networks.",

While there has been substantial progress in our understanding of confidence in oneself, little is known about how we form confidence about others. Here, we address this question by asking subjects undergoing fMRI to place bets on perceptual decisions made by themselves or one of three other players of varying ability. We show that subjects compute confidence in another players decisions by combining distinct estimates of player ability and decision difficulty - allowing them to predict that a good player may get a difficult decision wrong and that a bad player may get an easy decision right. We find that this computation is supported by an interaction between brain systems traditionally implicated in decision-making (LIP) and theory of mind (TPJ, dmPFC).

We also evaluated gene-expression and phenotypic differences among antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and characterized phenotype signatures of influenza- and EBV-specific CD8+ T cells that are unique to their pathogen targets. Moreover, with the high-throughput capacity of profiling hundreds of antigens simultaneously, we applied TetTCR-SeqHD to identify antigens that preferentially enrich cognate CD8+ T cells in type 1 diabetes patients compared to healthy controls, and discovered a TCR that cross reacts between diabetic and microbiome antigens.

We intend to investigate how the combined cascade works throughout the radiation process and its significance over radiotoxicity. Thirty adult mice were irradiated with electron beam radiation, and five were served as a control (Non treated). Mice were sacrificed after post 24 hours and 30 days of irradiation. We assessed the oxidative stress parameter and mRNA profile (Liver, Kidney, spleen, and germ cells), sperm viability, and motility. The mRNA profile study established the network of combined cascade work during radiation to combat oxidative response and cell survival. The quantitative examination of mRNA uncovers unique critical changes in all mRNA levels in all the cases, particularly in germ cells. Recuperation was likewise seen in post 30 days radiation in the liver, spleen, and kidney followed by oxidative stress parameters, however not in germ cells. It proposes reproductive physiology is exceptionally sensitive towards radiation, even at the molecular level. It also suggests the suppression of Lef1/axin2 could be the main reason for permanent failure in the sperm function process. Post irradiation likewise influences the morphology of sperms. The decrease in mRNA level of Lef1, Axin2, survivin, Ku70 suggests radiation inhibits the Wnt canonical pathway and failure in DNA repair mechanism in a coupled manner. Likewise, the increase in BAX and BCL2 suggests apoptosis activation followed by the decreased expression of enzymatic antioxidants. In summary, controlled several interlinked cascades execute when body exposure to radiation may further be used in a study to counterpart and better comprehend medication focus on radiation treatment.",

Gene knockout of the master regulator of mitochondrial fission, Drp1, prevents neoplastic transformation.

Here, we demonstrate that only fine-tuned repression of Drp1 establishes a  stem/progenitor-like state towards supporting carcinogen driven neoplastic transformation of keratinocytes, while more complete Drp1 repression prevents it. Only fine-tuned Drp1 repression maintains small networks of fused mitochondria to sustain a unique gene-expression profile with elevated stem/progenitor cell functional markers (Krt15, Sox2 etc) and their regulators (Cyclin E). Cells with such a mitochondria-primed state are slow cycling, susceptible to transformation, and when enriched by mild carcinogen exposure sustains elevated self-renewal/proliferation to form less differentiated tumors. Therefore, our data for the first time highlights a  goldilocks level of Drp1 repression that supports stem/progenitor state dependent neoplastic transformation.",

    "abstract": "Epstein Barr virus sequence variability has been deeply studied throughout the past years in isolates from various geographic regions and consequent geographic variation at both genetic and genomic levels has been described. However, isolates from South America have been underrepresented in these studies. Here, we sequenced 15 complete EBV genomes that we analyzed, by means of a custom-built bioinformatic pipeline, together with publicly available raw NGS data for 199 EBV isolates from other parts of the globe. Phylogenetic relations of the genomes, geographic structure and variability of the data set, and evolution rates for the whole genome and each gene were assessed. The present study contributes to overcome the scarcity of EBV complete genomes from South America, and hence, achieves the most comprehensive geography-related variability study by determining the actual contribution of each EBV gene to the geographic segregation of the entire genomes. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, we established for the first time the evolution rate for the entire EBV genome, on a host-virus codivergence-independent assumption, and statistically demonstrate that evolution rates, on a gene-by-gene basis, are related to the encoded protein function. Considering evolution of dsDNA viruses with a codivergence-independent approach, may lay the basis for future research on EBV evolution. Additionally, this work also expands the sampling-time lapse of available complete genomes derived from different EBV-related conditions, a matter that until today, prevents for detailed phylogeographic analysis.",

The subsequent cognitive transfer performance for the recognition of non-inactivated samples were tested on saliva, urine, and sweat in a randomised, double-blind controlled study.\n\nResultsDogs were tested on a total of 5242 randomised sample presentations. Dogs detected non-inactivated saliva samples with a diagnostic sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 95%. In a subsequent experiment to compare the scent recognition between the three non-inactivated body fluids, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 95% and 98% for urine, 91% and 94% for sweat, 82%, and 96% for saliva respectively.\n\nConclusionsThe scent cognitive transfer performance between inactivated and non-inactivated samples as well as between different sample materials indicates that global, specific SARS-CoV-2-associated volatile compounds are released across different body secretions, independently from the patients symptoms.\n\nFundingThe project was funded as a special research project of the German Armed Forces.

    "abstract": "Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it has become increasingly important to monitor the mutations that arise in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, to prepare public health strategies and guide the further development of vaccines and therapeutics. The spike (S) protein and the proteins comprising the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP) are key vaccine and drug targets, respectively, making mutation surveillance of these proteins of great importance.\n\nFull protein sequences for the spike proteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase proteins were downloaded from the GISAID database, aligned, and the variants identified. Polymorphisms in the protein sequence were investigated at the protein structural level and examined longitudinally in order to identify sequence and strain variants that are emerging over time. Our analysis revealed a group of variants in the spike protein and the polymerase complex that appeared in August, and account for around five percent of the genomes analyzed up to the last week of October. A structural analysis also facilitated investigation of several unique variants in the receptor binding domain and the N-terminal domain of the spike protein, with high-frequency mutations occurring more commonly in these regions. The identification of new variants emphasizes the need for further study on the effects of these mutations and the implications of their increased prevalence, particularly as these mutations may impact vaccine or therapeutic efficacy.",

Here, we have developed a novel cancer vaccine platform based on BCG that can direct BCG-induced immune responses against tumour antigens. By physically attaching tumour-specific peptides onto the mycobacterial outer membrane, we were able to induce strong systemic and intratumoural T cell-specific immune responses towards the attached tumour antigens. These therapeutic peptides can be attached to the mycobacterial outer membrane using a cell-penetrating peptide sequence derived from human immunodeficiency virus Tat, N-terminally fused to the tumour-specific peptides. Alternatively, therapeutic peptides can be conjugated with a poly-lysine sequence N-terminally fused to the tumour-specific peptides. Using two mouse models of melanoma and a mouse model of colorectal cancer, we observed that the anti-tumour responses of BCG can be significantly improved by coating the BCG with tumour-specific peptides. In addition, by combining this novel cancer vaccine platform with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, the number of responders to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy can be significantly increased.",

    "abstract": "Despite its omnipresence in everyday interactions and its importance for mental health, mood and its neuronal underpinnings are poorly understood. Computational models can help identify parameters affecting self-reported mood during mood induction tasks. Here we test if computationally modelled dynamics of self-reported mood during monetary gambling can be used to identify trial-by-trial variations in neuronal activity. To this end, we shifted mood in healthy (N=24) and depressed (N=30) adolescents by delivering individually tailored reward prediction errors whilst recording magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Following a pre-registered analysis, we hypothesize that expectation (defined by previous reward outcomes) would be predictive of beta-gamma oscillatory power (25-40Hz), a frequency shown to modulate to reward feedback. We also hypothesize that trial variations in the evoked response to the presentation of gambling options and in source localized responses to reward feedback. Through our multilevel statistical analysis, we found confirmatory evidence that beta-gamma power is positively related to reward expectation during mood shifts, with possible localized sources in the posterior cingulate cortex. We also confirmed reward prediction error to be predictive of trial-level variations in the response of the paracentral lobule and expectation to have an effect on the cerebellum after presentation of gambling options. To our knowledge, this is the first study to relate fluctuations in mood on a minute timescale to variations in neural oscillations with noninvasive electrophysiology.\n\nSignificance StatementBrain mechanisms underlying mood and its relationship with changes in reward contingencies in the environment are still elusive but could have a strong impact on our understanding and treatment of debilitating mood disorders. Building on a previously proposed computational mood model we use multilevel statistical models to find relationship between trial-by-trial variations in model components of mood and neural responses to rewards measured with non-invasive electrophysiology (MEG). Through confirmatory analysis we show that it is possible to observe relationships between trial variations in neural responses and computational parameters describing mood dynamics. Identifying the dynamics of mood and the neural processes it affects could pave the way for more effective neuromodulation treatments.",

    "abstract": "As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic was expanding, it was clear that effective testing for the presence of neutralizing antibodies in the blood of convalescent patients would be critical for development of plasma-based therapeutic approaches. To address the need for a high-quality neutralization assay against SARS-CoV-2, a previously established fluorescence reduction neutralization assay (FRNA) against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was modified and optimized. The SARS-CoV-2 FRNA provides a quantitative assessment of a large number of infected cells through use of a high-content imaging system. Because of this approach, and the fact that it does not involve subjective interpretation, this assay is more efficient and more accurate than other neutralization assays. In addition, the ability to set robust acceptance criteria for individual plates and specific test wells provided further rigor to this assay. Such agile adaptability avails use with multiple virus variants. By February 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 FRNA had been used to screen over 5,000 samples, including acute and convalescent plasma or serum samples and therapeutic antibody treatments, for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers.",

High frequency of somatic integration of the RNA virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into the DNA of infected cells was recently suggested, partly based on the detection of chimeric RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) reads between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RNA transcribed from human host DNA. Here, we examined the possible origin of human-SARS-CoV-2 chimeric reads in RNA-seq libraries and provide alternative explanations for their origin. Chimeric reads were frequently detected also between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RNA transcribed from mitochondrial DNA or episomal adenoviral DNA present in transfected cell lines, which was unlikely the result of SARS-CoV-2 integration. Furthermore, chimeric reads between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RNA transcribed from nuclear DNA was highly enriched for host exonic, than intronic or intergenic sequences and often involved the same, highly expressed host genes. These findings suggest that human-SARS-CoV-2 chimeric reads found in RNA-seq data may arise during library preparation and do not necessarily signify SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription, integration in to host DNA and further transcription.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression in many processes related to adaptive responses. A multitude of sRNAs have been identified in many bacterial species; however, their function has yet to be elucidated. A key step to understand sRNAs function is to identify the mRNAs these sRNAs bind to. There are several computational methods for sRNA target prediction, and the most accurate one is CopraRNA which is based on comparative-genomics. However, species-specific sRNAs are quite common and CopraRNA cannot be used for these sRNAs. The most commonly used transcriptome-wide sRNA target prediction method and second-most-accurate method is IntaRNA. However, IntaRNA can take hours to run on a bacterial transcriptome. Here we present sRNARFTarget, a machine-learning-based method for transcriptome-wide sRNA target prediction applicable to any sRNA. We comparatively assessed the performance of sRNARFTarget, CopraRNA and IntaRNA in three bacterial species. Our results show that sRNARFTarget outperforms IntaRNA in terms of accuracy, ranking of true interacting pairs, and running time. However, CopraRNA substantially outperforms the other two programs in terms of accuracy. Thus, we suggest using CopraRNA when homolog sequences of the sRNA are available, and sRNARFTarget for transcriptome-wide prediction or for species-specific sRNAs. sRNARFTarget is available at https://github.com/BioinformaticsLabAtMUN/sRNARFTarget.",

First, we developed an agent-based model (available as a new R package called TransmissionBias) that simulates the cultural transmission of house finch song given different parameters related to transmission biases, or biases in social learning that modify the probability of adoption of particular cultural variants. Next, we used approximate Bayesian computation and machine learning to estimate what parameter values likely generated the temporal changes in diversity in our observed data. We found evidence that strong content bias, likely targeted towards syllable complexity, plays a central role in the cultural evolution of house finch song in western Long Island. Frequency and demonstrator biases appear to be neutral or absent. Additionally, we estimated that house finch song is transmitted with extremely high fidelity. Future studies should use our simulation framework to better understand how cultural transmission and population declines influence song diversity in wild populations.",

However, B. abortus 2308 evaded the host immune function and established chronic infection by maintaining a balance between intracellular replication and inducing apoptosis, thus reducing DC maturation and antigen presentation to T cells. Toll-like receptor (TLR) -mediated signaling pathways were involved in the DC maturation and antigen presentation induced by Brucella OMPs. These results enhance understanding of Brucella pathogenesis and the host protective immune response mechanism and lay the foundation for the rational design of Brucella vaccines.",

We developed a bispecific, IgG1-like molecule (CoV-X2) based on two antibodies derived from COVID-19 convalescent donors, C121 and C1353. CoV-X2 simultaneously binds two independent sites on the RBD and, unlike its parental antibodies, prevents detectable S binding to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the virus cellular receptor. Furthermore, CoV-X2 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern, as well as the escape mutants generated by the parental monoclonals. In a novel animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection with lung inflammation, CoV-X2 protects mice from disease and suppresses viral escape. Thus, simultaneous targeting of non-overlapping RBD epitopes by IgG-like bispecific antibodies is feasible and effective, combining into a single molecule the advantages of antibody cocktails.",

    "abstract": "Occupancy models have been extended to account for either multiple spatial scales or species interactions in a dynamic setting. However, as interacting species (e.g., predators and prey) often operate at different spatial scales, including nested spatial structure might be especially relevant to models of interacting species. Here we bridge these two model frameworks by developing a multi-scale, two-species occupancy model. The model is dynamic, i.e. it estimates initial occupancy, colonization and extinction probabilities--including probabilities conditional to the other species presence. With a simulation study, we demonstrate that the model is able to estimate most parameters without marked bias under low, medium and high average occupancy probabilities, as well as low, medium and high detection probabilities, with only a small bias for some parameters in low-detection scenarios. We further evaluate the models ability to deal with sparse field data by applying it to a multi-scale camera trapping dataset on a mustelid-rodent predator-prey system. Most parameters are estimated with low uncertainty (i.e. narrow posterior distributions). More broadly, our model framework creates opportunities to explicitly account for the spatial structure found in many spatially nested study designs, and to study interacting species that have contrasting movement ranges with camera traps.",

    "abstract": "Defense against genome invaders universally relies on RNA-guided immunity. Prokaryotic CRISPR/Cas and eukaryotic RNA interference pathways recognize targets by complementary base-pairing, which places the sequences of their guide RNAs at the center of self/nonself discrimination. Here, we explore the sequence space of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), the genome defense of animals, and establish functional priority among individual sequences for the first time. Our results reveal that only the topmost abundant piRNAs are commonly present in every cell, while rare sequences generate cell-to-cell diversity in flies and mice. We identify a skewed distribution of sequence abundance as a hallmark of piRNA populations and show that quantitative differences of more than a thousand-fold are established by conserved mechanisms of biogenesis. Finally, our genomics analyses and direct reporter assays reveal that abundance determines function in piRNA-guided genome defense. Taken together, we identify an effective sequence space and untangle two classes of piRNAs that differ in complexity and function. The first class represents the topmost abundant sequences and drives silencing of genomic parasites. The second class sparsely covers an enormous sequence space. These rare piRNAs cannot function in every cell, every individual or every generation but create diversity with potential for adaptation in the ongoing arms race with genome invaders.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila Class IV neurons are polymodal nociceptors that detect noxious mechanical, thermal, optical and chemical stimuli. Escape behaviors in response to attacks by parasitoid wasps are dependent on Class IV cells, whose highly branched dendritic arbors form a fine meshwork that is thought to enable detection of the wasps needle-like ovipositor barb. To understand how mechanical stimuli trigger cellular responses, we used a focused 405-nm laser to create highly local lesions to probe the precise position needed in evoke responses. By imaging calcium signals in dendrites, axons, and soma in response to stimuli of varying positions, intensities and spatial profiles, we discovered that there are two distinct nociceptive pathways. Direct stimulation to dendrites (the contact pathway) produces calcium responses in axons, dendrites and the cell body whereas stimulation adjacent to the dendrite (the non-contact pathway) produces calcium responses in the axons only. We interpret the non-contact pathway as damage to adjacent cells releasing diffusible molecules that act on the dendrites. Axonal responses have higher sensitivities and shorter latencies. In contrast, dendritic responses have lower sensitivities and longer latencies. Stimulation of finer, distal dendrites leads to smaller responses than stimulation of coarser, proximal dendrites, as expected if the contact response depends on the geometric overlap of the laser profile and the dendrite diameter. Because the axon signals to the CNS to trigger escape behaviors, we propose that the density of the dendritic meshwork is high not only to enable direct contact with the ovipositor, but also to enable neuronal activation via diffusing signals from damaged surrounding cells. Dendritic contact evokes responses throughout the dendritic arbor, even to regions distant and distal from the stimulus. These dendrite-wide calcium signals may facilitate hyperalgesia or cellular morphological changes following dendritic damage.\n\nStatement of SignificanceAnimals encounter a wide range of noxious stimuli in the natural world. Nociceptive neurons are specialized cells that sense harmful stimuli and trigger avoidance responses. Class IV cells, located under the cuticle in Drosophila larvae, are polymodal nociceptors that respond to noxious mechanical, thermal, optical, and chemical stimuli. To investigate the spatial requirements of mechanoreception in Class IV neurons, we measured calcium signals evoked by a focused laser beam that creates highly localized tissue damage. We discovered that different cellular compartments - axons and dendrites - responded differentially depending on whether the stimulus makes direct contact with the neuron or not. This provides evidence that mechanical nociception in Class IV cells occurs via two distinct pathways.",

However, the roles of lipid mobilization and utilization in stem cell-driven regeneration are unclear. Planarian flatworms readily restore missing tissue due to injury-induced activation of pluripotent somatic stem cells called neoblasts. Here, we identify two intestine-enriched orthologs of apolipoprotein b, apob-1 and apob-2, which mediate transport of neutral lipid stores from the intestine to target tissues including neoblasts, and are required for tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Inhibition of apob function by RNAi causes head regression and lysis in uninjured animals, and delays body axis re-establishment and regeneration of multiple organs in amputated fragments. Furthermore, apob RNAi causes expansion of the population of differentiating neoblast progeny and dysregulates expression of genes enriched in differentiating and mature cells in eight major cell type lineages. We conclude that intestine-derived lipids serve as a source of metabolites required for neoblast differentiation.",

    "abstract": "In high-throughput omics disciplines like transcriptomics, researchers face a need to assess the quality of an experiment prior to an in-depth statistical analysis. To efficiently analyze such voluminous collections of data, researchers need triage methods that are both quick and easy to use. Such a normalization method for relative quantitation, CONSTANd, was recently introduced for isobarically-labeled mass spectra in proteomics. It transforms the data matrix of abundances through an iterative, convergent process enforcing three constraints: (I) identical column sums; (II) each row sum is fixed (across matrices) and (III) identical to all other row sums. In this study, we investigate whether CONSTANd is suitable for count data from massively parallel sequencing, by qualitatively comparing its results to those of DESeq2. Further, we propose an adjustment of the method so that it may be applied to identically balanced but differently sized experiments for joint analysis. We find that CONSTANd can process large data sets with about 2 million count records in less than a second whilst removing unwanted systematic bias and thus quickly uncovering the underlying biological structure when combined with a PCA plot or hierarchical clustering. Moreover, it allows joint analysis of data sets obtained from different batches, with different protocols and from different labs but without exploiting information from the experimental setup other than the delineation of samples into identically processed sets (IPSs). CONSTANds simplicity and applicability to proteomics as well as transcriptomics data make it an interesting candidate for integration in multi-omics workflows.",

This unreliable relationship to external stimuli renders any pattern of activity open to a multitude of plausible interpretations. We have previously shown that this uncertainty in cortical stimulus representations can be characterized using a probabilistic decoding algorithm, which inverts a generative model of stimulus-evoked cortical responses. Here, we improve upon this method in two important ways, which both target the precision with which the generative model can be estimated from limited, noisy training data. We show that these improvements lead to considerably better estimation of the presented stimulus and its associated uncertainty. Estimates of the presented stimulus are recovered with an accuracy that exceeds that of standard decoding methods (SVMs), and in some cases even approaches the behavioral accuracy of human observers. Moreover, the uncertainty in the decoded probability distributions better characterizes the precision of cortical stimulus information from trial to trial.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported that GABAergic neurons within the ventral anterior lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (alBST) express glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R) in rats, and that virally-mediated \"knock-down\" of GLP1R expression in the alBST prolongs the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to acute stress. Given other evidence that a GABAergic projection pathway from ventral alBST serves to limit stress-induced activation of the HPA axis, we hypothesized that GLP1 signaling promotes activation of GABAergic ventral alBST neurons that project directly to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). After PVN microinjection of fluorescent retrograde tracer followed by preparation of ex vivo rat brain slices, whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made in identified PVN-projecting neurons within the ventral alBST. Bath application of Exendin-4 (a specific GLP1R agonist) indirectly depolarized PVN-projecting neurons in the ventral alBST and adjacent hypothalamic parastrial nucleus (PS) via circuit-mediated effects that increased excitatory synaptic inputs and decreased inhibitory synaptic inputs to the PVN-projecting neurons; these effects were occluded by prior bath application of a GLP1R antagonist. Additional retrograde tracing experiments combined with in situ hybridization confirmed that PVN-projecting neurons within the ventral alBST/PS are GABAergic, and do not express GLP1R mRNA. Conversely, GLP1 mRNA is expressed by a subset of GABAergic neurons within the oval subnucleus of the dorsal alBST that project into the ventral alBST. Our novel findings reveal a potential GLP1R-mediated mechanism through which the alBST exerts inhibitory control over the endocrine HPA axis.",

Yet how somatosensory feedback from the hands is regulated as it first enters the brain, and whether this modulation exerts any influence on movement, remain unclear. Leveraging molecular-genetic access in mice, we find that tactile afferents from the hand recruit neurons in the brainstem cuneate nucleus whose activity is modulated by distinct classes of local inhibitory neurons. Selective manipulation of these inhibitory circuits can suppress or enhance the transmission of tactile information, affecting behaviors that rely on movement of the hands. Investigating whether these local circuits are subject to top-down control, we identify distinct descending cortical pathways that innervate cuneate in a complementary pattern. Somatosensory cortical neurons target the core tactile region of cuneate, while a large rostral cortical population drives feed-forward inhibition of tactile transmission through an inhibitory shell. These findings identify a circuit basis for tactile feedback modulation, enabling the effective execution of dexterous movement.",

To address the impact of (thermal or mechanical) fluctuations over time in the optical autofocus system itself, we utilise a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained over multiple days to account for such fluctuations. To address the trade-off between axial precision and range of the autofocus, we implement orthogonal optical readouts with separate CNN training data, thereby achieving an accuracy well within the 600 nm depth of field of our 1.3 numerical aperture objective lens over a defocus range of up to approximately +/- 100 m.

Current mouse models of metastasis are too expensive and time consuming to use for rapid and high-throughput screening. Therefore, we created a unique screening concept utilizing conserved mechanisms between zebrafish gastrulation and cancer metastasis for identification of potential anti-metastatic drugs. We hypothesized that small chemicals that interrupt zebrafish gastrulation might also suppress metastatic progression of cancer cells and developed a phenotype-based chemical screen to test the hypothesis. The screen used epiboly, the first morphogenetic movement in gastrulation, as a marker and enabled 100 chemicals to be tested in five hours. The screen tested 1280 FDA-approved drugs and identified Pizotifen, an antagonist for serotonin receptor 2C (HTR2C) as an epiboly-interrupting drug. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of HTR2C suppressed metastatic progression in a mouse model. Blocking HTR2C with Pizotifen restored epithelial properties to metastatic cells through inhibition of Wnt-signaling. In contrast, HTR2C induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through activation of Wnt-signaling and promoted metastatic dissemination of human cancer cells in a zebrafish xenotransplantation model. Taken together, our concept offers a novel platform for discovery of anti-metastasis drugs.",

Oxaliplatin-resistant cells exhibited transcriptional downregulation of caspase-10, but this had minimal effects on TRAIL sensitivity following CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of caspase-10 in parental cells. Sensitization effects in oxaliplatin-resistant cells were found to be a result of increased DR4, as well as significantly enhanced DR4 palmitoylation and translocation into lipid rafts.

Despite the limitation in scope and taxonomic precision, our data revealed the same patterns as academic studies of the same topic. Specifically, we conclude that the main cause of invertebrate community decline is fish overstocking, while diverse invertebrate communities require aquatic macrophytes. Pollution detectable by children has an effect on invertebrate community structure, but a different effect than fish has, and not as statistically robust. Importantly, almost all large ponds were found overstocked with fish; therefore, they support not more diversity than small ponds, but less, and serve as ecological traps.

It has been shown that Lrrk2 knockout (KO) rodents have enlarged lamellar bodies (LBs) in their alveolar epithelial type II cells, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we performed proteomic analyses on LBs isolated from Lrrk2 KO mice and found that the LB proteome is substantially different in Lrrk2 KO mice compared with wild-type mice. In Lrrk2 KO LBs, several Rab proteins were increased, and subunit proteins of BLOC-1-related complex (BORC) were decreased. The amount of surfactant protein C was significantly decreased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from Lrrk2 KO mice, suggesting that LB exocytosis is impaired in Lrrk2 KO mice. We also found that the enlargement of LBs is recapitulated in A549 cells upon KO of LRRK2 or by treating cells with LRRK2 inhibitors. Using this model, we show that KO of BORCS6, a BORC subunit gene, but not other BORC genes, causes LB enlargement.

    "abstract": "Dendritic spines of cortical pyramidal neurons are initially overproduced then remodeled substantially in the adolescent brain to achieve appropriate excitatory balance in mature circuits. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism of developmental spine pruning by Semaphorin 3F (Sema3F) and its holoreceptor complex, which consists of immunoglobulin-class adhesion molecule NrCAM, Neuropilin-2 (Npn2), and PlexinA3 (PlexA3) signaling subunits. Structure-function studies of the NrCAM-Npn2 interface showed that NrCAM stabilizes binding between Npn2 and PlexA3 necessary for Sema3F-induced spine pruning. Using a mouse neuronal culture system, we identified a dual signaling pathway for Sema3F-induced pruning, which involves activation of Tiam1-Rac1-PAK1-3 -LIMK1/2-Cofilin1 and RhoA-ROCK1/2-Myosin II in dendritic spines. Inhibitors of actin remodeling impaired spine collapse in the cortical neurons. Elucidation of these pathways expands our understanding of critical events that sculpt neuronal networks and may provide insight into how interruptions to these pathways could lead to spine dysgenesis in diseases such as autism, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.",
