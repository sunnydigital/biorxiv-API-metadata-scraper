    "abstract": "Hyperinsulinemia is commonly viewed as a compensatory response to insulin resistance, yet studies have suggested that chronically elevated insulin may also drive insulin resistance. The molecular mechanisms underpinning this potentially cyclic process remain poorly defined, especially on a transcriptome-wide level. To study the direct effects of prolonged exposure to excess insulin in muscle cells, we incubated C2C12 myotubes with elevated insulin for 16 hours, followed by 6 hours of serum starvation, and established that acute AKT and ERK signaling were attenuated in this model of in vitro hyperinsulinemia. Global RNA-sequencing of cells both before and after nutrient withdrawal highlighted genes in the insulin signaling, FOXO signaling, and glucose metabolism pathways indicative of  hyperinsulinemia and  starvation programs. We observed that hyperinsulinemia led to a substantial reduction in insulin receptor (Insr) gene expression, and subsequently a reduced surface INSR and total INSR protein, both in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptomic meta-analysis in >450 human samples demonstrated that fasting insulin reliably and negatively correlated with insulin receptor (INSR) mRNA in skeletal muscle. Bioinformatic modeling combined with RNAi, identified SIN3A as a negative regulator of Insr mRNA (and JUND, MAX, and MXI as positive regulators of Irs2 mRNA). Together, our analysis identifies novel mechanisms which may explain the cyclic processes underlying hyperinsulinemia-induced insulin resistance in muscle, a process directly relevant to the etiology and disease progression of type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCharacterising gene function for the ever-increasing number and diversity of species with annotated genomes relies almost entirely on computational prediction methods. These software are also numerous and diverse, each with different strengths and weaknesses as revealed through community benchmarking efforts. Meta-predictors that assess consensus and conflict from individual algorithms should deliver enhanced functional annotations.\n\nResultsTo exploit the benefits of meta-approaches, we developed CrowdGO, an open-source consensus-based Gene Ontology (GO) term meta-predictor that employs machine learning models with GO term semantic similarities and information contents. By re-evaluating each gene-term annotation, a consensus dataset is produced with high-scoring confident annotations and low-scoring rejected annotations. Applying CrowdGO to results from a deep learning-based, a sequence similarity-based, and two protein domain-based methods, delivers consensus annotations with improved precision and recall. Furthermore, using standard evaluation measures CrowdGO performance matches that of the communitys best performing individual methods.\n\nConclusionCrowdGO offers a model-informed approach to leverage strengths of individual predictors and produce comprehensive and accurate gene functional annotations.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationCrowdGO is implemented in Python3, and is freely available from https://gitlab.com/mreijnders/CrowdGO, with a Snakemake workflow and pre-trained models.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection is a significant driver of speciation. Yet it remains largely unknown whether local adaptation can drive speciation through the evolution of hybrid sterility between populations. Here, we show that adaptive divergence in shoot gravitropism, the ability of a plants shoot to bend upwards in response to the downward pull of gravity, contributes to the evolution of hybrid sterility in an Australian wildflower, Senecio lautus. We find that shoot gravitropism has evolved multiple times in association with plant height between adjacent populations inhabiting contrasting environments, suggesting that these traits have evolved by natural selection. We directly tested this prediction using a hybrid population subjected to eight rounds of recombination and three rounds of selection in the field. It revealed that shoot gravitropism responds to natural selection in the expected direction of the locally adapted population. This provided an ideal platform to test whether genetic differences in gravitropism contribute to hybrid sterility in S. lautus. Using this advanced hybrid population, we discovered that crossing individuals with extreme differences in gravitropism reduce their ability to produce seed by 21%, providing strong evidence that this adaptive trait is genetically correlated with hybrid sterility. Our results suggest that natural selection can drive the evolution of locally adaptive traits that also create hybrid sterility, thus indicating an evolutionary connection between local adaptation and the origin of new species.\n\nSignificance statementNew species originate as populations become reproductively isolated from one another. Despite recent progress in uncovering the genetic basis of reproductive isolation, it remains unclear whether intrinsic reproductive barriers, such as hybrid sterility, evolve as a by-product of local adaptation to contrasting environments or evolve through non-ecological processes, such as meiotic drive. Here, we show that differences in a plants response to the pull of gravity have repeatedly evolved amongst coastal populations of an Australian wildflower, thus implicating a role of natural selection in their evolution. We found a strong genetic correlation between variation in this adaptive trait and hybrid sterility, suggesting that intrinsic reproductive barriers contribute to the origin of new species as populations adapt to heterogeneous environments.",

    "abstract": "Molecular switches are central to signal transduction in protein interaction networks. One switch protein can independently regulate distinct cellular processes, but the molecular mechanisms enabling this functional multi-specificity remain unclear. Here we integrate system-scale cellular and biophysical measurements to study how a paradigm switch, the small GTPase Ran/Gsp1, achieves its functional multi-specificity. We make 55 targeted point mutations to individual interactions of Ran/Gsp1 and show through quantitative, systematic genetic and physical interaction mapping that Ran/Gsp1 interface perturbations have widespread cellular consequences that cluster by biological processes but, unexpectedly, not by the targeted interactions. Instead, the cellular consequences of the interface mutations group by their biophysical effects on kinetic parameters of the GTPase switch cycle, and cycle kinetics are allosterically tuned by distal interface mutations. We propose that the functional multi-specificity of Ran/Gsp1 is encoded by a differential sensitivity of biological processes to different kinetic parameters of the Gsp1 switch cycle, and that Gsp1 partners binding to the sites of distal mutations act as allosteric regulators of the switch. Similar mechanisms may underlie biological regulation by other GTPases and biological switches. Finally, our integrative platform to determine the quantitative consequences of cellular perturbations may help explain the effects of disease mutations targeting central switches.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication is a complex process that is tightly regulated to ensure faithful genome duplication, and its perturbation leads to DNA damage and genomic instability. Replication stress is commonly associated with slow and stalled replication forks. Recently, accelerated replication has emerged as a non-canonical form of replication stress. However, the molecular basis underlying fork acceleration is largely unknown. Here we show that increased topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) expression induces aberrant replication fork acceleration and DNA damage by decreasing RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops). Degradation of R-loops by overexpression of RNaseH1 also accelerates replication and generates DNA damage. Furthermore, upregulation of TOP1 by activation of the mutated HRAS oncogene leads to fork acceleration and DNA damage in pre-senescent cells. In these cells, restoration of TOP1 expression level or mild replication inhibition rescues the perturbed replication and reduces DNA damage. These findings highlight the importance of TOP1 equilibrium in the regulation of R-loop homeostasis to ensure faithful DNA replication and genome integrity.",

However, the analysis of these screens presents significant statistical challenges. For example, technical factors like sequencing depth impact not only expression measurement but also perturbation detection, creating a confounding effect. We demonstrate on two recent high multiplicity of infection single-cell CRISPR screens how these challenges cause calibration issues among existing analysis methods. To address these challenges, we propose SCEPTRE: analysis of single-cell perturbation screens via conditional re-sampling. This methodology, designed to avoid calibration issues due to technical confounders and expression model misspecification, infers associations between perturbations and expression by resampling the former according to a working model for perturbation detection probability in each cell. SCEPTRE demonstrates excellent calibration and sensitivity on the CRISPR screen data and yields hundreds of new regulatory relationships, supported by orthogonal functional evidence.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have demonstrated improved performance at predicting the sequence specificities of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins compared to previous methods that rely on k-mers and position weight matrices. To gain insights into why a DNN makes a given prediction, model interpretability methods, such as attribution methods, can be employed to identify motif-like representations along a given sequence. Because explanations are given on an individual sequence basis and can vary substantially across sequences, deducing generalizable trends across the dataset and quantifying their effect size remains a challenge. Here we introduce global importance analysis (GIA), a model interpretability method that quantifies the population-level effect size that putative patterns have on model predictions. GIA provides an avenue to quantitatively test hypotheses of putative patterns and their interactions with other patterns, as well as map out specific functions the network has learned. As a case study, we demonstrate the utility of GIA on the computational task of predicting RNA-protein interactions from sequence. We first introduce a convolutional network, we call ResidualBind, and benchmark its performance against previous methods on RNAcompete data. Using GIA, we then demonstrate that in addition to sequence motifs, ResidualBind learns a model that considers the number of motifs, their spacing, and sequence context, such as RNA secondary structure and GC-bias.",

    "abstract": "Genetic swamping resulting from interspecific hybridisation can increase extinction risk for threatened species. The development of high-throughput and reduced-representation genomic sequencing and analyses to generate large numbers of high resolution genomic markers has the potential to reveal introgression previously undetected using small numbers of genetic markers. However, few studies to date have implemented genomic tools to assess the extent of interspecific hybridisation in threatened species. Here we investigate the utility of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to detect introgression resulting from past interspecific hybridisation in one of the worlds rarest birds. Anthropogenic impacts have resulted in hybridisation and subsequent backcrossing of the critically endangered Aotearoa New Zealand endemic kak[i] (black stilts; Himantopus novaezelandiae) with the non-threatened self-introduced congeneric poaka (Aotearoa New Zealand population of pied stilts, Himantopus himantopus leucocephalus), yet genetic analyses with a limited set of microsatellite markers revealed no evidence of introgression of poaka genetic material in kak[i], excluding one individual. We use genomic data for [~]63% of the wild adult kak[i] population to reassess the extent of introgression resulting from hybridisation between kak[i] and poaka. Consistent with previous genetic analyses, we detected no introgression from poaka into kak[i]. These collective results indicate that, for kak[i], existing microsatellite markers provide a robust, cost-effective approach to detect cryptic hybrids. Further, for well-differentiated species, the use of genomic markers may not be required to detect admixed individuals.",

    "abstract": "The flexible adjustment of ongoing behavior challenges the nervous systems dynamic control mechanisms and has shown to be specifically susceptible to age-related decline. Previous work links endogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) with behavioral efficiency across perceptual and cognitive domains, with potentially the strongest impact on those behaviors that require a high level of dynamic control. Based on the integrated analyses of behavior and modulation of interhemispheric phase-based connectivity during dynamic motor state transitions and endogenous GABA concentration, we provide converging evidence for age-related differences in the behaviorally more beneficial state of endogenous GABA concentration. We suggest that the increased interhemispheric connectivity seen in the older adults represents a compensatory mechanism caused by rhythmic entrainment of neural populations in homotopic motor cortices. This mechanism appears to be most relevant in the presence of a less optimal tuning of the inhibitory tone to uphold the required flexibility of behavioral action.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing techniques generate large volumes of DNA sequencing data at ultra-fast speed and extremely low cost. As a consequence, sequencing techniques have become ubiquitous in biomedical research and are used in hundreds of genomic applications. Efficient data structures and algorithms have been developed to handle the large datasets produced by these techniques. The prevailing method to index DNA sequences in those data structures and algorithms is by using k-mers (k-long substrings) known as minimizers. Minimizers are the smallest k-mers selected in every consecutive window of a fixed length in a sequence, where the smallest is determined according to a predefined order, e.g., lexicographic. Recently, a new k-mer order based on a universal hitting set (UHS) was suggested. While several studies have shown that orders based on a small UHS have improved properties, the utility of using them in high-throughput sequencing analysis tasks has not been demonstrated to date.\n\nHere, we demonstrate the practical benefit of UHSs for the first time, in the genome assembly task. Reconstructing a genome from billions of short reads is a fundamental task in high-throughput sequencing analyses. De Bruijn graph construction is a key step in genome assembly, which often requires very large amounts of memory and long computation time. A critical bottleneck lies in the partitioning of DNA sequences into bins. The sequences in each bin are assembled separately, and the final de Bruijn graph is constructed by merging the bin-specific subgraphs. We incorporated a UHS-based order in the bin partition step of the Minimum Substring Partitioning algorithm of Li et al. (2013). Using a UHS-based order instead of lexicographic- or random-ordered minimizers produced lower density minimizers with more balanced bin partitioning, which led to a reduction in both runtime and memory usage.",

    "abstract": "Understanding drivers of antibiotic resistance evolution is fundamental for designing optimal treatment strategies and interventions to reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance. Various cytotoxic drugs used in cancer chemotherapy have antibacterial properties, but how bacterial populations are affected by these selective pressures is unknown. Here we test the hypothesis that the widely used cytotoxic drug methotrexate affects the evolution and selection of antibiotic resistance through the same mechanisms as the antibiotic trimethoprim. We show that methotrexate can select for trimethoprim resistance determinants located on the chromosome or a plasmid in clinical strains of Escherichia coli. Additionally, methotrexate can co-select for virtually any antibiotic resistance determinant when present together with trimethoprim resistance on a multidrug-resistance clinical plasmid. These selective effects occur at concentrations 40- to >320-fold below the methotrexate minimal inhibitory concentration for E. coli, suggesting a selective role of methotrexate chemotherapy for antibiotic resistance in patients that strongly depend on effective antibiotic treatment.\n\nSignificance statementThe presented data show that methotrexate has the potential to select for virtually any given antibiotic resistance gene when genetically linked to trimethoprim resistance. This study highlights the need for increased awareness of the presence of acquired antibiotic resistance determinants in the gut of patients with impaired immunity undergoing methotrexate treatment to preserve the effects of downstream antibiotic treatments.",

    "abstract": "Biofertilization via the inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), combined with rhizobia and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), are beginning to become established as an effective and sustainable measure to improve yields. Biofertilization might have a particular potential to boost the yield of intercropping systems in rainfed areas because AMF can form a common mycorrhizal network (CMN) that can transfer nutrients and water between two plants and balance as such belowground competition. In this study, we tested if biofertilizers can enhance the yield of intercropping systems using a pigeon pea (PP) - finger millet (FM) intercropping system grown for two consecutive growing seasons (2016/17 and 2017/18) at two contrasting sites in Bengaluru and Kolli Hills, India. To validate the process of bioirrigation (transfer of water between rhizosphere of two plants), we tested, for the first time, if the spatial arrangement of intercropped plants using either a row-wise or a mosaic design affected yield and water relations with and without biofertilizers. Our results demonstrate that intercropping can improve the straw and grain yield in PP-FM intercropping compared to the respective monocultures but that intercropping effects vary depending on the site characteristic such as climate and soil type. Spatial arrangement of component plants affected the total, straw and grain biomass in intercropping treatments, but this effect also varied across sites. Most importantly, the results from the 2017-18 growing season clearly demonstrated a positive effect of biofertilizer on biomass yield, and this effect was irrespective of site, spatial arrangement, mixed or monoculture. Despite a yield increase in intercropping, we did not see a positive effect of biofertilization on water relations of FM possibly due to interspecific competition for soil moisture where PP dominated. In summary, our study shows the potential of biofertilizers to increase the yield of intercropping systems in rainfed dryland agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Sample sizes vary substantially across tissues in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, where considerably fewer samples are available from certain inaccessible tissues, such as the substantia nigra (SSN), than from accessible tissues, such as blood. This severely limits power for identifying tissue-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in undersampled tissues. Here we propose Surrogate Phenotype Regression Analysis (SO_SCPLOWPRAYC_SCPLOW) for leveraging information from a correlated surrogate outcome (e.g. expression in blood) to improve inference on a partially missing target outcome (e.g. expression in SSN). Rather than regarding the surrogate outcome as a proxy for the target outcome, SO_SCPLOWPRAYC_SCPLOW jointly models the target and surrogate outcomes within a bivariate regression framework. Unobserved values of either outcome are treated as missing data. We describe and implement an expectation conditional maximization algorithm for performing estimation in the presence of bilateral outcome missingness. SO_SCPLOWPRAYC_SCPLOW estimates the same association parameter estimated by standard eQTL mapping and controls the type I error even when the target and surrogate outcomes are truly uncorrelated. We demonstrate analytically and empirically, using simulations and GTEx data, that in comparison with marginally modeling the target outcome, jointly modeling the target and surrogate outcomes increases estimation precision and improves power.",

    "abstract": "The transition between pluripotent and tissue-specific states is a key aspect of development. Understanding the pathways driving these transitions will facilitate the engineering of properly differentiated cells for experimental and therapeutic uses. Here, we showed that during mesoderm differentiation, the transcription factor Oct1 activated developmental lineage-appropriate genes that were silent in pluripotent cells. Using mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with an inducible knockout of Oct1, we showed that Oct1 deficiency resulted in poor induction of mesoderm-specific genes, leading to impaired mesodermal and terminal muscle differentiation. Oct1-deficient cells exhibited poor temporal coordination of the induction of lineage-specific genes and showed inappropriate developmental lineage branching, resulting in poorly differentiated cell states retaining epithelial characteristics. In ESCs, Oct1 localized with the pluripotency factor Oct4 at mesoderm-associated genes and remained bound to those loci during differentiation after the dissociation of Oct4. Binding events for Oct1 overlapped with those for the histone lysine demethylase Utx, and an interaction between Oct1 and Utx suggested that these two proteins cooperate to activate gene expression. The specificity of the ubiquitous Oct1 for the induction of mesodermal genes could be partially explained by the frequent coexistence of Smad and Oct binding sites at mesoderm-specific genes and the cooperative stimulation of mesodermal gene transcription by Oct1 and Smad3. Together, these results identify Oct1 as a key mediator of mesoderm lineage-specific gene induction.",

Using full length single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), gene fusions can now be detected at single cell level. However, scRNA-seq data has a high noise level and contains various technical artefacts that can lead to spurous fusion discoveries. Here we present a computational tool, scFusion, for gene fusion detection based on scRNA-seq. scFusion can efficiently and sensitively detect fusions with a low false discovery rate. In a T cell data, scFusion detected the invariant TCR gene recombinations in Mucosal-associated invariant T cells that many methods developed for bulk-data failed to detect.

    "abstract": "Minimally-evolved codes are constructed with randomly chosen Standard Genetic Code (SGC) triplets, and completed with completely random triplet assignments. Such \"genetic codes\" have not evolved, but retain SGC qualities. Retained qualities are inescapable, part of the logic of code evolution. For example, sensitivity of coding to arbitrary assignments, which must be <{approx} 10%, is intrinsic. Such sensitivity comes from elementary combinatorial properties of coding, and constrains any SGC evolution hypothesis. Similarly, evolution of last-evolved functions is difficult, due to late kinetic phenomena, likely common across codes. Census of minimally-evolved code assignments shows that shape and size of wobble domains controls packing into a coding table, strongly shifting accuracy of codon assignments. Access to the SGC therefore requires a plausible pathway to limited randomness, avoiding difficult completion while packing a highly ordered, degenerate code into a fixed three-dimensional space. Late Crick wobble in a 3-dimensional genetic code assembled by lateral transfer satisfies these varied, simultaneous requirements. By allowing parallel evolution of SGC domains, it can yield shortened evolution to SGC-level order, and allow the code to arise in smaller populations. It effectively yields full codes. Less obviously, it unifies well-studied sources for order in amino acid coding, including a stereochemical minority of triplet-amino acid associations. Finally, fusion of its intermediates into the definitive SGC is credible, mirroring broadly-accepted later cellular evolution.",

    "abstract": "Most age-related human diseases are accompanied by a decline in cellular organelle integrity, including impaired lysosomal proteostasis and defective mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. An open question, however, is the degree to which inherited variation in or near genes encoding each organelle contributes to age-related disease pathogenesis. Here, we evaluate if genetic loci encoding organelle proteomes confer greater-than-expected age-related disease risk. As mitochondrial dysfunction is a \"hallmark\" of aging, we begin by assessing nuclear and mitochondrial DNA loci near genes encoding the mitochondrial proteome and surprisingly observe a lack of enrichment across 24 age-related traits. Within nine other organelles, we find no enrichment with one exception: the nucleus, where enrichment emanates from nuclear transcription factors. In agreement, we find that genes encoding several organelles tend to be \"haplosufficient,\" while we observe strong purifying selection against heterozygous protein-truncating variants impacting the nucleus. Our work identifies common variation near transcription factors as having outsize influence on age-related trait risk, motivating future efforts to determine if and how this inherited variation then contributes to observed age-related organelle deterioration.",

With REAP, patient samples are applied to a genetically-barcoded library containing 2,688 human extracellular proteins displayed on the surface of yeast. Antibody-coated cells are isolated by magnetic selection and deep sequencing of their barcodes is used to identify the displayed antigens. To benchmark the performance of REAP, we screened 77 patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy (APECED). REAP sensitively and specifically detected known autoantibody reactivities in APECED in addition to numerous previously unidentified reactivities. We further screened 106 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and identified novel autoantibody reactivities against a diverse set of antigens including growth factors, extracellular matrix components, cytokines, and immunomodulatory proteins. Several of these responses were associated with disease severity and specific clinical manifestations of SLE and exerted potent functional effects on cell signaling ex vivo. These findings demonstrate the utility of REAP to atlas the expansive landscape of exoproteome-targeting autoantibodies and their impacts on patient health outcomes.",

Specifically, we developed VAMPIRE: Variant Annotation Method Pointing to Interesting Regulatory Effects, an interactive web application implemented in R Shiny (http://shiny.bios.unc.edu/vampire/). This tool efficiently integrates and displays information from multiple complementary sources, including epigenomic signatures from blood cell relevant tissues or cells, functional and conservation summary scores, variant impact on protein and gene expression, chromatin conformation information, as well as publicly available GWAS and phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) results. Leveraging data generated from independently performed functional validation experiments, we demonstrate that our prioritized variants, genes, or variant-gene links are significantly more likely to be experimentally validated. This study not only has important implications for systematic and efficient revelation of functional mechanisms underlying GWAS variants for hematological traits, but also provides a prototype that can be adapted to many other complex traits, paving the path for efficient variant to function (V2F) analyses.",

    "abstract": "Despite redundant cellular pathways to minimize translational errors, errors in protein synthesis are common. Pathways and mechanisms to minimize errors are classified as pre-ribosomal or ribosomal. Pre-ribosomal pathways are primarily concerned with appropriate pairing of tRNAs with their cognate amino acid, whereas to date, ribosomal proof-reading has been thought to only be concerned with minimizing decoding errors, since it has been assumed that the ribosomal decoding centre is blind to mischarged tRNAs. Here, we identified that in mycobacteria, deletion of the 16S ribosomal RNA methyltransferase gidB led to increased discrimination of mischarged tRNAs. GidB deletion was necessary but not sufficient for reducing mistranslation due to misacylation. Discrimination only occurred in mycobacteria enriched from environments or genetic backgrounds with high rates of mistranslation. Our data suggest that mycobacterial ribosomes are capable of discriminating mischarged tRNAs and that 16S rRNA methylation by GidB may act as a capacitor for moderating translational error.",

    "abstract": "In natural settings, many stimuli impinge on our sensory organs simultaneously. Parsing these sensory stimuli into perceptual objects is a fundamental task faced by all sensory systems. Similar to other sensory modalities, increased odor backgrounds decrease the detectability of target odors by the olfactory system. The mechanisms by which background odors interfere with the detection and identification of target odors are unknown. Here we utilized the framework of the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) to consider possible interference mechanisms in an odor detection task. We consider effects of background odors on both signal and noise in the decision-making dynamics, and show that these produce different predictions about decision accuracy and speed. To test these predictions, we trained mice to detect target odors that are embedded in random background mixtures in a two-alternative choice task. Trial duration was independent of behavioral reaction times to avoid motivating rapid responses. We found that the behavioral data is most consistent with background odors acting by adding noise to the decision-making dynamics. The added noise decreases the correct rate, but also decreases decision times, thereby creating a paradoxical relationship between speed and accuracy of target detection, where mice make faster and less accurate decisions in the presence of background odors.",

    "abstract": "Over the last six decades, populations of the bumblebees Bombus sylvicola and Bombus balteatus in Colorado have experienced decreases in tongue length, a trait important for plant-pollinator mutualisms. It has been hypothesized that this observation reflects selection resulting from shifts in floral composition under climate change. Here we used morphometrics and population genomics to determine whether morphological change is ongoing, investigate the genetic basis of morphological variation, and analyze population structure in these populations. We generated a genome assembly of B. balteatus. We then analyzed whole-genome sequencing data and morphometric measurements of 580 samples of both species from seven high-altitude localities. Out of 281 samples originally identified as B. sylvicola, 67 formed a separate genetic cluster comprising a newly-discovered cryptic species (\"incognitus\"). However, an absence of genetic structure within species suggests that gene flow is common between mountains. We found a significant decrease in tongue length between bees collected between 2012-2014 and in 2017, indicating that morphological shifts are ongoing. We did not discover any genetic associations with tongue length, but a SNP related to production of a proteolytic digestive enzyme was implicated in body size variation. We identified evidence of covariance between kinship and both tongue length and body size, which is suggestive of a genetic component of these traits, although it is possible that shared environmental effects between colonies are responsible. Our results provide evidence for ongoing modification of a morphological trait important for pollination and indicate that this trait likely has a complex genetic and environmental basis.",

    "abstract": "Granulocytes mediate broad immunoprotection through phagocytosis, extracellular traps, release of cytotoxic granules, antibody effector functions and recruitment of other immune cells against pathogens. However, descriptions of granulocytes in HIV infection and mucosal tissues are limited. Our goal was to characterize granulocyte subsets in systemic, mucosal and lymphoid tissues during lentivirus infection using the rhesus macaque (RM) model. Mononuclear cells from jejunum, colon, cervix, vagina, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and whole blood from naive, and chronically SHIVsf162p3-infected RM were analyzed by microscopy and polychromatic flow cytometry. Granulocytes were identified using phenotypes designed specifically for RM: eosinophils - CD45+CD66+CD49d+; neutrophils - CD45+CD66+CD14+; and basophils - CD45+CD123+FcR{varepsilon}+. Nuclear visualization with DAPI staining and surface marker images by ImageStream (cytometry/microscopy) further confirmed granulocytic phenotypes. Flow cytometric data showed that all RM granulocytes expressed CD32 (FcR{gamma}II) but did not express CD16 (FcR{gamma}III). Additionally, constitutive expression of CD64 (FcR{gamma}I) on neutrophils and FcR{varepsilon} on basophils, indicates the differential expression of Fc receptors on granulocyte subsets. Granulocytic subsets in naive whole blood ranged 25.4-81.5% neutrophils, 0.59-13.3% eosinophils and 0.059-1.8% basophils. Interestingly, elevated frequencies of circulating neutrophils, colorectal neutrophils, and colorectal eosinophils were all observed in chronic lentivirus disease. Conversely, circulating basophils, jejunal eosinophils, vaginal neutrophils, and vaginal eosinophils of SHIVsf162p3-infected RM declined in frequency. Overall, our data suggest modulation of granulocytes in chronic lentivirus infection, most notably in the gastrointestinal mucosae where significant inflammation and disruption occurs in lentivirus-induced disease. Furthermore, granulocytes may migrate to inflamed tissues during infection and could serve as targets of immunotherapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "The non-vascular plant Marchantia polymorpha has emerged as a valuable model for studying evolutionarily conserved microbial infection strategies and plant immune responses. However, only a handful of fungal pathogens of Marchantia have been described so far. Here we establish a new pathosystem using the root-infecting vascular wilt fungus Fusarium oxysporum. On angiosperms, this fungus exhibits exquisite adaptation to the plant vascular niche and host-specific pathogenicity, both of which are conferred by lineage-specific effectors secreted during growth in the xylem. We show that F. oxysporum isolates with different lifestyles - pathogenic or endophytic - are able to infect this non-vascular liverwort causing tissue maceration and plant cell killing. Similar to bacterial pathogens, F. oxysporum induces a PAMP-triggered immune response in M. polymorpha. Analysis of isogenic fungal mutants established that infection of Marchantia requires conserved fungal pathogenicity mechanisms such as mitogen activated protein kinases, transcriptional regulators and cell wall remodeling enzymes. Remarkably, lineage-specific virulence effectors are dispensable for infection, most likely due to the absence of xylem tissue in this non-vascular plant. The F. oxysporum - M. polymorpha system provides new insights into the mechanism and evolution of pathogenic and endophytic fungus-plant interactions.\n\nSignificance statementRoot-infecting vascular fungi cause wilt diseases and provoke devastating losses in hundreds of crops. It is currently unknown how these pathogens evolved and whether they infect non-vascular plants, which diverged from vascular plants over 450 million years ago. Here we show that two strains of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum with opposed lifestyles, causing either wilting and death or beneficial protection on tomato, produce similar disease symptoms on the non-vascular plant Marchantia polymorpha. We define a set of core fungal pathogenicity factors required on both vascular and non-vascular plants and show that host-specific effectors contributing to disease on tomato are dispensable on Marchantia. These findings suggest that systemic wilt disease evolved in fungal pathogens after the emergence of vascular land plants.",

However, current methods are limited to providing simple DTIs without mode of action (MoA), or they show unsatisfactory performance for a limited range of compounds and targets. Here, we propose AI-DTI, a novel method that predicts activatory and inhibitory DTIs by combining the mol2vec and genetically perturbed transcriptomes. We trained the model on large-scale DTIs with MoA and found that our model outperformed a previous model that predicted activatory and inhibitory DTIs. To extend the applicability, we applied the inferential method for the target vector so that our method can learn and predict a wider range of targets. Our method achieved satisfactory performance in an independent dataset where the target was unseen in the training set and a high-throughput screening dataset where positive and negative samples were explicitly defined. Finally, our method successfully rediscovered approximately half of the DTIs for drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19. These results indicate that AI-DTI is a practically useful tool for guiding drug discovery processes and generating plausible hypotheses that can reveal unknown mechanisms of drug action.",

Seqpac provides a framework of functions for analyzing a PAC object, which contains 3 standardized tables: sample phenotypic information (P), sequence annotations (A), and a counts table with unique sequences across the experiment (C). By applying a sequence-based counting strategy that maintains the integrity of the fastq sequence, seqpac increases flexibility and transparency compared to other workflows. It also contains an innovative targeting system allowing sequence counts to be summarized and visualized across sample groups and sequence classifications. Reanalyzing published data, we show that seqpacs fastq trimming performs equal to standard software outside R and demonstrate how sequence-based counting detects previously unreported bias. Applying seqpac to new experimental data, we discovered a novel rRF that was down-regulated by RNA pol I inhibition (anticancer treatment), and up-regulated in previously published data from tumor positive patients. Seqpac is available on github (https://github.com/Danis102/seqpac), runs on multiple platforms (Windows/Linux/Mac), and is provided with a step-by-step vignette on how to analyze sRNA-seq data.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies binding to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike have therapeutic promise, but emerging variants show the potential for virus escape. This emphasizes the need for therapeutic molecules with distinct and novel neutralization mechanisms. Here we isolated a nanobody that interacts simultaneously with two RBDs from different spike trimers of SARS-CoV-2, rapidly inducing the formation of spike trimer-dimers leading to the loss of their ability to attach to the host cell receptor, ACE2. We show that this nanobody potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2, including the B.1.351 variant, and cross-neutralizes SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of the nanobody against SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.351 variant in a human ACE2 transgenic mouse model. This naturally elicited bispecific monomeric nanobody establishes a novel strategy for potent inactivation of viral antigens and represents a promising antiviral against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility, pathogenesis and resistance to vaccines presents urgent challenges for curbing the COVID-19 pandemic. While Spike mutations that enhance virus infectivity or neutralizing antibody evasion may drive the emergence of these novel variants, studies documenting a critical role for interferon responses in the early control of SARS-CoV-2 infection, combined with the presence of viral genes that limit these responses, suggest that interferons may also influence SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Here, we compared the potency of 17 different human interferons against multiple viral lineages sampled during the course of the global outbreak, including ancestral and four major variants of concern. Our data reveal increased interferon resistance in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, suggesting that evasion of innate immunity may be a significant, ongoing driving force for SARS-CoV-2 evolution. These findings have implications for the increased lethality of emerging variants and highlight the interferon subtypes that may be most successful in the treatment of early infections.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn less than 2 years since its spillover into humans, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 220 million people, causing over 4.5 million COVID-19 deaths. High infection rates provided substantial opportunities for the virus to evolve, as variants with enhanced transmissibility, pathogenesis, and resistance to vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies have emerged. While much focus has centered on the Spike protein which the virus uses to infect target cells, mutations were also found in other viral proteins that might inhibit innate immune responses. Specifically, viruses encounter a potent innate immune response mediated by the interferons, two of which, IFN2 and IFN{beta}, are being repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. Here, we compared the potency of human interferons against ancestral and emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. Our data revealed increased interferon resistance in emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains that included the alpha, beta, gamma and delta variants of concern, suggesting a significant, but underappreciated role for innate immunity in driving the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, is a global health issue with unprecedented challenges for public health. SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects cells of the respiratory tract, via Spike glycoprotein binding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2). Circadian rhythms coordinate an organisms response to its environment and can regulate host susceptibility to virus infection. We demonstrate a circadian regulation of ACE2 in lung epithelial cells and show that silencing BMAL1 or treatment with a synthetic REV-ERB agonist SR9009 reduces ACE2 expression and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry. Treating infected cells with SR9009 limits viral replication and secretion of infectious particles, showing that post-entry steps in the viral life cycle are influenced by the circadian system. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Bmal1 silencing induced a wide spectrum of interferon stimulated genes in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells, providing a mechanism for the circadian pathway to dampen SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study suggests new approaches to understand and improve therapeutic targeting of SARS-CoV-2.",

Based on high-resolution structures, the two viruses bind in practically identical conformations, although several residues of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) differ between them. Here we have used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, machine learning (ML), and free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations to elucidate the differences in RBD binding by the two viruses. Although only subtle differences were observed from the initial MD simulations of the two RBD-ACE2 complexes, ML identified the individual residues with the most distinctive ACE2 interactions, many of which have been highlighted in previous experimental studies. FEP calculations quantified the corresponding differences in binding free energies to ACE2, and examination of MD trajectories provided structural explanations for these differences. Lastly, the energetics of emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations were studied, showing that the affinity of the RBD for ACE2 is increased by N501Y and E484K mutations but is slightly decreased by K417N.",

    "abstract": "Attention deficit/Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most diagnosed psychiatric disorders nowadays. The core symptoms of the condition include hyperactivity, impulsiveness and inattention. The main pharmacological treatment consists of psychostimulant drugs affecting Dopamine Transporter (DAT) function. We have previously shown that genetically modified mice lacking p35 protein (p35KO), which have reduced Cdk5 activity, present key hallmarks resembling those described in animal models useful for studying ADHD. The p35KO mouse displays spontaneous hyperactivity and shows a calming effect of methylphenidate or amphetamine treatment. Interestingly, dopaminergic neurotransmission is altered in these mice as they have an increased Dopamine (DA) content together with a low DA turnover. This led us to hypothesize that the lack of Cdk5 activity affects DAT expression and/or function in this animal model. In this study, we performed biochemical assays, cell-based approaches, quantitative fluorescence analysis and functional studies that allowed us to demonstrate that p35KO mice exhibit decreased DA uptake and reduced cell surface DAT expression levels in the striatum (STR). These findings are supported by in vitro observations in which the inhibition of Cdk5 activity in N2a cells induced a significant increase in constitutive DAT endocytosis with a concomitant increase in DAT localization to recycling endosomes. Taken together, these data provide evidences regarding the role of Cdk5/p35 in DAT expression and function, thus contributing to the knowledge of DA neurotransmission physiology and also providing therapeutic options for the treatment of DA pathologies such as ADHD.",

    "abstract": "Disturbed sleep is a key symptom in major depressive disorder (MDD). REM sleep alterations are well described in the current fliterature, but little is known about non-REM sleep alterations. Additionally, sleep disturbances relate to a variety of cognitive symptoms in MDD, but which features of non-REM sleep EEG contribute to this, remains unknown. We comprehensively analyzed non-REM sleep EEG features in three independently collected datasets (N=284). These included MDD patients with a broad age range, varying duration and severity of depression, unmedicated or medicated, age- and gender-matched to healthy controls. We explored changes in sleep architecture including sleep stages and cycles, spectral power, sleep spindles, slow waves (SW), and SW-spindle coupling. Next, we analyzed the association of these sleep features with acute measures of depression severity and overnight consolidation of procedural memory. Overall, no major systematic alterations in non-REM sleep architecture were found in patients compared to controls. For the microstructure of non-REM sleep, we observed a higher spindle amplitude in unmedicated patients compared to controls, and after the start of antidepressant medication longer SWs with lower amplitude and a more dispersed SW-spindle coupling. In addition, long-term, but not short-term medication seemed to lower spindle density. Overnight procedural memory consolidation was impaired in medicated patients and associated with lower sleep spindle density. Our results suggest that alterations in non-REM sleep EEG might be more subtle than previously reported. We discuss these findings in the context of antidepressant medication intake and age.\n\nStatement of SignificanceDepression affects large and diverse populations worldwide, including their sleep. Most sleep is non-REM sleep, which is vital to cognitive function, including memory. How non-REM is affected during a depression or medical treatment remains poorly investigated. We classified non-REM sleep of depressive patients against healthy controls in unprecedented analysis detail and confidence using the largest dataset published so far while also test sleep alterations associations with impaired memory. Surprisingly, severe depression alone did not alter sleep. We observed severe non-REM sleep alterations only worsening under patient medication, which ultimately coincided with 24-hour memory impairments. Though causal influences of medication on sleep in depressive patients remains to be investigated, this cautions common clinical practice in long-term treatment with antidepressants.",

Mapping of UNC-45A in the mouse upper genital tract and central nervous system reveals its enrichment in highly proliferating and prone to remodeling cells and in microtubule-rich areas of in the ovaries and in neurons respectively. In both apparatuses UNC-45A is also abundantly expressed in the ciliated epithelium. Because regulators of acto-myosin contractility and MT stability are essential for the physiopathology of the female reproductive tract and of neuronal development our findings suggest that UNC-45A may have a role in ovarian cancer initiation and development and in neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Dram1 is a stress and infection inducible autophagy modulator that functions downstream of transcription factors p53 and NF{kappa}B. Using a zebrafish embryo infection model, we have previously shown that Dram1 provides protection against the intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium marinum by promoting the p62-dependent xenophagy of bacteria that have escaped into the cytosol. However, the possible interplay between Dram1 and other anti-bacterial autophagic mechanisms remains unknown. Recently, LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) has emerged as an important host defense mechanism that requires components of the autophagy machinery and targets bacteria directly in phagosomes. Our previous work established LAP as the main autophagic mechanism by which macrophages restrict growth of Salmonella Typhimurium in a systemically infected zebrafish host. We therefore employed this infection model to investigate the possible role of Dram1 in LAP. Morpholino knockdown or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutation of Dram1 led to reduced host survival and increased bacterial burden during S. Typhimurium infections. In contrast, overexpression of dram1 by mRNA injection curtailed Salmonella replication and reduced mortality of the infected host. During the early response to infection, GFP-Lc3 levels in transgenic zebrafish larvae correlated with the dram1 expression level, showing over two-fold reduction of GFP-Lc3-Salmonella association in dram1 knockdown or mutant embryos and an approximately 30% increase by dram1 overexpression. Since LAP is known to require the activity of the phagosomal NADPH oxidase, we used a Salmonella biosensor strain to detect bacterial exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and found that the ROS response was largely abolished in the absence of dram1. Together, these results demonstrate the host protective role of Dram1 during S. Typhimurium infection and suggest a functional link between Dram1 and the induction of LAP.",

Ambroxol HCl, diazoxide, digoxin, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, pantoprazole, phenytoin, verapamil and drug Y had an inhibitory effect on nitric oxide production, while all the test drugs had an inhibitory effect on superoxide production. Amiloride HCl, diazoxide, digoxin, furosemide, phenytoin, verapamil, drug X and drug Y enhanced the expression of IL-1{beta} and TNF-. Unlike most immunomodulatory compounds currently in clinical use, most of the test drugs inhibited some inflammatory processes while promoting others. Ion pumps and ion channels could therefore serve as targets for more selective immunomodulatory agents which do not cause overt immunosupression.",

    "abstract": "The disialoganglioside GD2 is consistently overexpressed in neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma, and is variably expressed in other sarcomas, gliomas, neuroendocrine tumors, and epithelial cancers. Anti-GD2 antibodies have improved the survival rates of patients with neuroblastoma only when administered as part of intense chemotherapy-based cytotoxic regimens, which are associated with debilitating late effects including hearing loss, growth retardation, and secondary leukemias. Despite broad expression of GD2 on osteosarcoma, anti-GD2 antibody has not mediated significant antitumor activity in that disease or any other GD2+ cancers. CD47 is a checkpoint molecule overexpressed on tumor cells that inhibits macrophage activity, and CD47 blockade has demonstrated promising clinical activity in early human trials. We investigated whether anti-CD47 antibody could enhance the efficacy of anti-GD2 antibody in neuroblastoma and other GD2+ malignancies. We demonstrate substantial synergy of these two agents, resulting in the recruitment of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) to mediate robust and durable anti-tumor responses. The responses are driven by GD2-specific factors that reorient the balance of macrophage activity towards phagocytosis of tumor cells, including disruption of a newly described GD2:Siglec-7 axis. These results demonstrate the unique synergy of combining anti-GD2 with anti-CD47, which has the potential to significantly enhance outcomes for children with neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma and will soon be investigated in a first-in-human clinical trial.",

However, it is known that permissive mutations in the neuraminidase (NA) of former seasonal A(H1N1) viruses from 2007-2009 buffered the detrimental effect of the NA H275Y mutation, resulting in fit oseltamivir-resistant viruses that circulated widely. This study explored two approaches to predict permissive mutations that may enable a fit H275Y A(H1N1)pdm09 variant to arise.\n\nA computational approach used phylogenetic and in silico protein stability analyses to predict potentially permissive mutations, which were then evaluated by in vitro NA enzyme activity and expression analysis, followed by in vitro replication. The second approach involved the generation of a virus library which encompassed all possible individual 2.9 x 104 codon mutations in the NA whilst keeping H275Y fixed. To select for variant viruses with the greatest fitness, the virus library was serially passaged in ferrets (via contact and aerosol transmission) and resultant viruses were deep sequenced.\n\nThe computational approach predicted three NA permissive mutations, and even though they only offset the in vitro impact of H275Y on NA enzyme expression by 10%, they could restore replication fitness of the H275Y variant in A549 cells. In our experimental approach, a diverse virus library (97% of 8911 possible single amino-acid substitutions were sampled) was successfully transmitted through ferrets, and sequence analysis of resulting virus pools in nasal washes identified three mutations that improved virus transmissibility. Of these, one NA mutation, I188T, has been increasing in frequency since 2017 and is now present in 90% of all circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.\n\nOverall, this study provides valuable insights into the evolution of the influenza NA protein and identified several mutations that may potentially facilitate the emergence of a fit H275Y A(H1N1)pdm09 variant.",

Despite an unprecedented research effort, effective therapeutics are still missing to limit severe disease and mortality. Using high-throughput screening, we identified acriflavine as a potent papain-like protease (PLpro) inhibitor. NMR titrations and a co-crystal structure confirm that acriflavine blocks the PLpro catalytic pocket in an unexpected binding mode. We show that the drug inhibits viral replication at nanomolar concentration in cellular models, in vivo in mice and ex vivo in human airway epithelia, with broad range activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other betacoronaviruses. Considering that acriflavine is an inexpensive drug approved in some countries, it may be immediately tested in clinical trials and play an important role during the current pandemic and future outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Reassortment of the Rotavirus A (RVA) 11-segment dsRNA genome may generate new genome constellations that allow RVA to expand its host range or evade immune responses. Reassortment may also produce phylogenetic incongruities and weakly linked evolutionary histories across the 11 segments, obscuring reassortant-specific epistasis and changes in substitution rates. To determine the co-segregation patterns of RVA segments, we generated time-scaled phylogenetic trees for each of the 11 segments of 789 complete RVA genomes isolated from mammalian hosts and compared the segments geodesic distances. We found that segments 4 (VP4) and 9 (VP7) occupied significantly different treespaces from each other and from the rest of the genome. By contrast, segments 10 and 11 (NSP4 and NSP5/6) occupied nearly indistinguishable treespaces, suggesting strong co-segregation. Host-species barriers appeared to vary by segment, with segment 9 (VP7) presenting the least conservation by host species. Bayesian skyride plots were generated for each segment to compare relative genetic diversity among segments over time. All segments showed a dramatic decrease in diversity around 2007 coinciding with the introduction of RVA vaccines. To assess selection pressures, codon adaptation indices and relative codon deoptimization indices were calculated with respect to common host genomes. Codon usage varied by segment with segment 11 (NSP5) exhibiting significantly higher adaptation to host genomes. Furthermore, RVA codon usage patterns appeared optimized for expression in humans and birds relative to the other hosts examined, suggesting that translational efficiency is not a barrier in RVA zoonosis.",

    "abstract": "A repeating sequence and structure pattern that is highly similar to the canonical cofactor binding motif has been identified in the thiamin-diphosphate dependent (ThDP) enzyme family. We have identified more than a thousand of these repeats in a non-redundant set (N = 58) of ThDP enzyme structures. The repeating element has a helix-turn-strand secondary structure which typically begins with an [G/A]{X(1,2)}[G/A] sequence motif with a typical length of 29 residues. The catalytically important diphosphate and aminopyrimidine interacting domains are comprised of a set of six of these repeats in a conserved architecture with a flavodoxin-like 213465 strand order. The canonical ThDP binding motif is the fourth repeat in the ThDP binding domain, while the conserved aminopyrimidine interacting glutamate is part of the second repeat in its domain. The third and fourth repeats form a contact between the functional domains, while the fifth repeat in the N-terminal domain forms an inter-chain contact. The conservation of these functional properties highlights the role of these repeats in the function and structure of this well-studied enzyme family and agrees with the principle of modular assembly in protein ancestry.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trials of SHP2 inhibitors (SHP2i) alone and in various combinations are ongoing for multiple tumors with over-activation of the RAS/ERK pathway. SHP2 plays critical roles in normal cell signaling; hence, SHP2is could influence the tumor microenvironment. We found that SHP2i treatment depleted alveolar and M2-like macrophages and promoted B and T lymphocyte infiltration in Kras- and Egfr-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, treatment also increased intratumor gMDSCs via tumor-intrinsic, NF-kB-dependent production of CXCR2 ligands. Other RAS/ERK pathway inhibitors also induced CXCR2 ligands and gMDSC influx in mice, and CXCR2 ligands were induced in tumors from patients on KRASG12C-inhibitor trials. Combined SHP2(SHP099)/CXCR1/2(SX682) inhibition depleted a specific cluster of S100a8/9high gMDSCs, generated Klrg1+ CD8+ effector T cells with a strong cytotoxic phenotype but expressing the checkpoint receptor NKG2A, and enhanced survival in Kras-and Egfr-mutant models. Our results argue for testing RAS/ERK pathway/CXCR1/2/NKG2A inhibitor combinations in NSCLC patients.\n\nStatement of SignificanceOur study shows that inhibiting the SHP2/RAS/ERK pathway triggers NF-kB-dependent up-regulation of CXCR2 ligands and recruitment of S100A8high gMDSCs, which suppress T cells in NSCLC. Combining SHP2 and CXCR2 inhibitors blocks this gMDSC immigration, resulting in enhanced Th1 polarization, induction of CD8+ KLRG1+ effector T cells with high cytotoxic activity and improved survival in multiple NSCLC models.",

    "abstract": "Fluctuating bioavailability of inorganic phosphate (Pi), often caused by complex Pi-metal interactions, guide root tip growth and root system architecture for maximizing the foraged soil volume. Two interacting genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, PDR2 (P5-type ATPase) and LPR1 (multicopper oxidase), are central to external Pi monitoring by root tips, which is modified by iron (Fe) co-occurrence. Upon Pi deficiency, the PDR2-LPR1 module facilitates cell type-specific Fe accumulation and cell wall modifications in root meristems, inhibiting intercellular communication and thus root growth. LPR1 executes local Pi sensing, whereas PDR2 restricts LPR1 function. We show that native LPR1 displays specific ferroxidase activity and requires a conserved acidic triad motif for high-affinity Fe2+ binding and root growth inhibition under limiting Pi. Our data indicate that substrate availability tunes LPR1 function and implicate PDR2 in maintaining Fe homeostasis. LPR1 represents the prototype of an ancient ferroxidase family, which evolved very early upon bacterial colonization of land. During plant terrestrialization, horizontal gene transfer transmitted LPR1-type ferroxidase from soil bacteria to the common ancestor of Zygnematophyceae algae and embryophytes, a hypothesis supported by homology modeling, phylogenomics, and activity assays of bacterial LPR1-type multicopper oxidases.",

Using an encoding task in which participants learned to predict which stimuli are followed by aversive shocks, combined with univariate, multivoxel, and large-scale network analyses of fMRI data, we show that enhanced memory for events associated with negative PEs was linked to reduced hippocampal responses to PEs and increased crosstalk between the  salience network and a frontoparietal network commonly implicated in memory formation for events that are in line with prior expectation. These PE-related effects could not be explained by mere changes in physiological arousal or the prediction itself. Our results suggest that superior memory for events associated with high PEs is driven by a distinct neural mechanism that might serve to set memories of high PE events apart from those with expected outcomes.",

Humans dynamically direct their gaze such that the retinal images of objects of interest fall onto the foveola, the central one-degree diameter of the fovea 6-8, but it is yet unclear if a relationship between the individual photoreceptor topography at this location and visual fixation behavior exists 9,10. By employing adaptive optics in vivo imaging and micro-stimulation 11-13, we created topographical maps of the complete foveolar cone mosaics in both eyes of 20 healthy participants while simultaneously recording the retinal location of a fixated visual object in a psychophysical experiment with cellular resolution. We found that the locus of fixation was systematically shifted away from the topographical centers towards a naso-superior quadrant on the retina, about 5 minutes of arc of visual angle on average, with a mirror symmetrical trend between fellow eyes. In cyclopean view, the topographical centers were superior to the fixated target, corresponding to areas in the visual field usually more distant 14,15 and thus containing higher spatial frequencies. Given the large variability in foveal topography between individuals, and the surprising precision with which fixation is repeatedly directed to just a small bouquet of cones in the foveola, these findings demonstrate a finely tuned, functionally relevant link between the development of the cellular mosaic of photoreceptors and visual behavior.",

    "abstract": "The guanosine nucleotide derivatives ppGpp and pppGpp, are central to the remarkable capacity of bacteria to adapt to fluctuating environment and metabolic perturbations. These alarmones are synthesized by two proteins, RelA and SpoT in E. coli and the activities of each of the two enzymes are highly regulated for homeostatic control of (p)ppGpp levels in the cell. Although the domain structure and function of RelA are well defined, the findings of this study unfold the regulatory aspect of RelA that is possibly relevant in vivo. We uncover here the importance of the N-terminal 1-119 amino acids of the enzymatically compromised (p)ppGpp hydrolytic domain (HD) of monofunctional RelA for the (p)ppGpp mediated regulation of RelA-CTD function. We find that even moderate level expression of RelA appreciably reduces growth when the basal levels of (p)ppGpp in the cells are higher than in the wild type, an effect independent of its ability to synthesize (p)ppGpp. This is evidenced by the growth inhibitory effects of oversynthesis of the RelA-CTD in the relA+ strain but not in relA null mutant, suggesting the requirement of the functional RelA protein for basal level synthesis of (p)ppGpp, accordingly corroborated by the restoration of the growth inhibitory effects of the RelA-CTD expression in the relA1 spoT202 mutant. The N-terminal 119 amino acids of RelA fused in-frame with the RelA-CTD, both from 406-744 amino acids (including TGS) and from 454-744 amino acids (sans TGS) caused growth inhibition only in spoT1 and spoT202 relA1 mutants, uncovering the hitherto unrealized (p)ppGpp-dependent regulation of RelA-CTD function. An incremental rise in the (p)ppGpp levels is proposed to progressively modulate the interaction of RelA-CTD with the ribosomes, with possible implications in the feedback regulation of the N-terminal (p)ppGpp synthesis function, a proposal that best explains the nonlinear relationship between (p)ppGpp synthesis and increased ratio of RelA:ribosomes, both in vitro as well as in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Exploring the composition and evolution regularity of genome sequences and constructing phylogenetic relationship by alignment-free method in genome level are high-profile topics. Our previous researches discovered the CG and TA independent selection law s existed in genome sequences by analysis on the spectral features of 8-mer subsets of 920 eukaryote and prokaryote genomes. We found that the evolution state of genomes is determined by the intensity of the two independent selections and the degree of the mutual inhibition between them. In this study, the two independent selection patterns of 22 primate and 28 insect genome sequences were analyzed further. The two complete 8-mer motif sets containing CG or TA dinucleotide and their feature of relative frequency are proposed. We found that the two 8-mer sets and their feature are related directly to sequence evolution of genomes. According to the relative frequency of two 8-mer sets, phylogenetic trees were constructed respectively for the given primate and insect genomes. Through analysis and comparison, we found that our phylogenetic trees are more consistent with the known conclusions. The two kinds of phylogenetic relationships constructed by CG 8-mer set and TA 8-mer set are similar in insect genomes, but the phylogenetic relationship constructed by CG 8-mer set reflect the evolution state of genomes in current age and phylogenetic relationship constructed by TA 8-mer set reflect the evolution state of genomes in a slight earlier period. We thought it is the result that the TA independent selection is repressed by the CG independent selection in the process of genome evolution. Our study provides a theoretical approach to construct more objective evolution relationships in genome level.",

    "abstract": "The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is inhabited by a complex microbial community, which contributes to its homeostasis. Disrupted microbiome can cause GI-related diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, therefore identifying host-microbe interactions is crucial for better understanding gut health. Bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs), released into the gut lumen, can cross the mucus layer and access underlying immune cells. To study cross-kingdom communication between BEVs and host, we focused on the influence of BEVs, generated by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (VPI-5482), on host immune cells. Using single-cell RNA sequencing data and host-microbe protein-protein interaction networks, we examined the potential effect of BEVs on dendritic cells, macrophages and monocytes with particular focus on the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway. We identified biological processes affected in each immune cell type, and also cell-type specific processes (e.g myeloid cell differentiation). The TLR pathway analysis highlighted that BEV targets differ among cells and even between the same cells in healthy versus disease (ulcerative colitis) conditions. Our in silico findings were validated in BEV-monocyte co-cultures demonstrating the requirement for TLR4 in BEV-elicited NF-{kappa} B activation. This study demonstrates that both cell-type and health condition influence BEV-host communication. The results and the pipeline can facilitate BEV-based therapy development for the treatment of IBD.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the neural basis of the remarkable human cognitive capacity to learn novel concepts from just one or a few sensory experiences constitutes a fundamental problem. We propose a simple, biologically plausible, mathematically tractable, and computationally powerful neural mechanism for few-shot learning of naturalistic concepts. We posit that the concepts that can be learnt from few examples are defined by tightly circumscribed manifolds in the neural firing rate space of higher order sensory areas. We further posit that a single plastic downstream readout neuron learns to discriminate new concepts based on few examples using a simple plasticity rule. We demonstrate the computational power of our proposal by showing it can achieve high few-shot learning accuracy on natural visual concepts using both macaque inferotemporal cortex representations and deep neural network models of these representations, and can even learn novel visual concepts specified only through linguistic descriptors. Moreover, we develop a mathematical theory of few-shot learning that links neurophysiology to behavior by delineating several fundamental and measurable geometric properties of high-dimensional neural representations that can accurately predict the few-shot learning performance of naturalistic concepts across all our numerical simulations. We discuss testable predictions of our theory for psychophysics and neurophysiological experiments.",
