    "abstract": "Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) theory in MRI was proposed to account for the effect of vessel/capillary perfusion on the aggregate diffusion weighted MR signal. The prevalent IVIM modeling is based on equation-1: SI(b)/SI(0) = (1 -PF) x exp(-b x Dslow) + PF x exp(-b x Dfast) [1] where SI(b) and SI(0) denote the signal intensity of images acquired with the b-factor value of b and b=0 s/mm2, respectively. We recently reported that, for the liver and likely for other organs as well, IVIM modeling of the perfusion component is constrained by the diffusion component, with a reduced Dslow measure leading to artificially higher PF and Dfast measures. With higher b-value associated lower image signal of the targeted tissue, Euqation-1 is focused on describing the signal decay pattern along increasingly higher b-values by three IVIM parameters. Signal intensity at each b-value (i.e., SI(b)) is normalised by the signal intensity of b=0 image (i.e., SI(0)). We noted an apparent problem for Euqation-1. For example, if we want to compare the IVIM parameters of the normal liver parenchyma and a liver tumor, following Euqation-1 we will take the assumption that the SI(0) of the normal parenchyma and the tumor are the same and considered equally as 1 (or 100) for the biexponential decay modelling. However, this assumption is invalid for many scenarios. From our liver IVIM database of 27 healthy female subjects, we chose six of the youngest subjects (20-27 yrs) and six of the oldest subjects (58-71 yrs) and measured the signals of the liver and left erector spinae muscle on b=0 and 2 s/mm2 images. The results show, while there was no apparent difference of left erector spinae muscle signal among the young and elderly groups, the elderly groups liver SI(0) is approximately 20 % lower than that of young group. This difference skewed the ratios of various SI(b)/SI(0) and the followed IVIM parameter determination. The general trend is that lower liver SI(0) is associated with lower Dslow and higher PF and Dfast. If IVIM bi-exponential decay fitting starts from a very low non-zero b images (such as b=2 s/mm2 images), this problem persists. We performed an additional analysis of our IVIM database of five cirrhotic livers and the results show SI(b=2) of cirrhotic right liver is positively associated Dslow (Pearson r=0.687), and negatively associated with PF (Pearson r=-0.733). Though the examples we used in this letter are on liver aging and liver fibrosis, the points discussed are expected to be generalisable to other pathologies and to other organs.",

    "abstract": "Accessible chromatin and unmethylated DNA are associated with many genes and cis-regulatory elements. Attempts to understand natural variation for accessible chromatin regions (ACRs) and unmethylated regions (UMRs) often rely upon alignments to a single reference genome. This limits the ability to assess regions that are absent in the reference genome assembly and monitor how nearby structural variants influence variation in chromatin state. In this study, de novo genome assemblies for four maize inbreds (B73, Mo17, Oh43 and W22) are utilized to assess chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation patterns in a pan-genome context. The number of UMRs and ACRs that can be identified is more accurate when chromatin data is aligned to the matched genome rather than a single reference genome. While there are UMRs and ACRs present within genomic regions that are not shared between genotypes, these features are substantially enriched within shared regions, as determined by chromosomal alignments. Characterization of UMRs present within shared genomic regions reveals that most UMRs maintain the unmethylated state in other genotypes with only a small number being polymorphic between genotypes. However, the majority of UMRs between genotypes only exhibit partial overlaps suggesting that the boundaries between methylated and unmethylated DNA are dynamic. This instability is not solely due to sequence variation as these partially overlapping UMRs are frequently found within genomic regions that lack sequence variation. The ability to compare chromatin properties among individuals with structural variation enables pan-epigenome analyses to study the sources of variation for accessible chromatin and unmethylated DNA.\n\nArticle summaryRegions of the genome that have accessible chromatin or unmethylated DNA are often associated with cis-regulatory elements. We assessed chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation in four structurally diverse maize genomes. There are accessible or unmethylated regions within the non-shared portions of the genomes but these features are depleted within these regions. Evaluating the dynamics of methylation and accessibility between genotypes reveals conservation of features, albeit with variable boundaries suggesting some instability of the precise edges of unmethylated regions.",

Predicting the amount of ligand binding for a cell remains an important question in computational biology as it can provide great insight into cell-to-cell communication and rational drug design toward specific targets. In this study, we extend a mechanistic, two-step multivalent binding model. This model predicts the behavior of a mixture of different multivalent ligand complexes binding to cells expressing various types of receptors. It accounts for the combinatorially large number of interactions between multiple ligands and receptors, optionally allowing a mixture of complexes with different valencies and complexes that contain heterogeneous ligand units. We derive the macroscopic predictions and demonstrate how this model enables large-scale predictions on mixture binding and the binding space of a ligand. This model thus provides an elegant and computationally efficient framework for analyzing multivalent binding.",

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorders are accompanied by atypical brain activity and impairments in brain connectivity. In particular, dynamic functional connectivity approaches highlighted aberrant brain fluctuations at rest in individuals with autism compared to a group composed of typically developed individuals, matched in age and gender. However, the characterization of these variations remains unclear. Here, we quantified the spatio-temporal network dynamics using two novel dynamic group-based measures, namely system diversity and spatio-temporal diversity. Using the public database ABIDE 1, we explored the differences between individuals with autism and typically developed individuals. Our results show evidence that individuals with autism have atypical connectivity patterns over time characterized by a lower integration of heterogeneous cognitive processes and unstable functional activity, except for the default mode network presenting its own specific dynamic pattern. Within the autism group, we find this pattern of results to be stronger in more severely affected patients with a predominance of symptoms in the social affect domain. However, patients with prominently restricted and repetitive behaviours demonstrate a more conservative profile of brain dynamics characterized by a lower spatio-temporal diversity of the default mode network.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by a cognitive impairment associated to amyloid beta (A{beta}) aggregation and deposition in the brain. A{beta} is generated by sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by {beta}-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and {gamma}-secretase complex. The mechanisms that underlie exacerbated production of A{beta}, favoring its deposition in the brain, is largely unknown. In vitro studies have shown that A{beta} aggregates trigger enhanced production of A{beta} by a yet non described mechanism. Here, we show that in different cell types, including human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), oligomers and fibrils of A{beta} enhance the convergence and interaction of APP and BACE1 in endosomal compartments. We demonstrated a key role of A{beta}-APP/Go/G{beta}{gamma} signaling on the amyloidogenic processing of APP. We show that APP mutants with impaired capacity to bind A{beta} or to activate Go protein, are unable to exacerbate APP and BACE1 colocalization in the presence of A{beta}. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of G{beta}{gamma} subunits signaling with gallein, abrogate A{beta}-dependent interaction of APP and BACE1 in endosomes preventing {beta}-processing of APP. Collectively, these findings uncover a feed-forward mechanism of amyloidogenesis that might contribute to A{beta} pathology in early stages of AD and suggest that gallein might have clinical relevance.",

    "abstract": "Vaccines are critical for curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic (1, 2). In the USA, two highly protective mRNA vaccines are available: BNT162b2 from Pfizer/BioNTech and mRNA-1273 from Moderna (3, 4). These vaccines induce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, including neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) predominantly directed against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) (1-4). Serum NAbs are induced at modest levels within [~]1 week of the first dose, but their titers are strongly boosted by a second dose at 3 (BNT162b2) or 4 weeks (mRNA-1273) (3, 4). SARS-CoV-2 is most commonly transmitted nasally or orally and infects cells in the mucosae of the respiratory and to some extent also the gastrointestinal tract (5). Although serum NAbs may be a correlate of protection against COVID-19, mucosal antibodies might directly prevent or limit virus acquisition by the nasal, oral and conjunctival routes (5). Whether the mRNA vaccines induce mucosal immunity has not been studied. Here, we report that antibodies to the S-protein and its RBD are present in saliva samples from mRNA-vaccinated healthcare workers (HCW). Within 1-2 weeks after their second dose, 37/37 and 8/8 recipients of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, respectively, had S-protein IgG antibodies in their saliva, while IgA was detected in a substantial proportion. These observations may be relevant to vaccine-mediated protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease.",

We used a library screening approach to detect binding interactions across one of the largest known panels of membrane-bound and soluble receptors, comprising 5845 targets, expressed recombinantly in human cells. We were able confirm and replicate SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 and other putative coreceptors such as CD209 and CLEC4M. More significantly, we identified interactions with a number of novel SARS-CoV-2 S binding proteins. Three of these novel receptors, NID1, CNTN1 and APOA4 were specific to SARS-CoV-2, and not SARS-COV, with APOA4 binding the S-protein with equal affinity as ACE2. With this knowledge we may further understand the disease pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients and how infection by SARS-CoV-2 may lead to differences in pathology in specific organs or indeed the virulence observed in different ethnicities. Importantly we illustrate a methodology which can be used for rapid, unbiassed identification of cell surface receptors, to support drug screening and drug repurposing approaches for this and future pandemics.",

    "abstract": "The global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has triggered numerous efforts to develop therapeutic options for COVID-19 pandemic. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro), which is a critical enzyme for transcription and replication of SARS-CoV-2, is a key target for therapeutic development against COVID-19. An organoselenium drug called ebselen has recently been demonstrated to have strong inhibition against Mpro and antiviral activity but its molecular mode of action is unknown preventing further development. We have examined the binding modes of ebselen and its derivative in Mpro via high resolution co-crystallography and investigated their chemical reactivity via mass spectrometry. Stronger Mpro inhibition than ebselen and potent ability to rescue infected cells were observed for a number of ebselen derivatives. A free selenium atom bound with cysteine 145 of Mpro catalytic dyad has been revealed by crystallographic studies of Mpro with ebselen and MR6-31-2 suggesting hydrolysis of the enzyme bound organoselenium covalent adduct, formation of a phenolic by-product is confirmed by mass spectrometry. The target engagement of these compounds with an unprecedented mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibition suggests wider therapeutic applications of organo-selenium compounds in SARS-CoV-2 and other zoonotic beta-corona viruses.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput genomics of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to characterize virus evolution and to identify adaptations that affect pathogenicity or transmission. While single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) are commonly considered as driving virus adaption, RNA recombination events that delete or insert nucleic acid sequences are also critical. Whole genome targeting sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 is typically achieved using pairs of primers to generate cDNA amplicons suitable for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). However, paired-primer approaches impose constraints on where primers can be designed, how many amplicons are synthesized and requires multiple PCR reactions with non-overlapping primer pools. This imparts sensitivity to underlying SNVs and fails to resolve RNA recombination junctions that are not flanked by primer pairs. To address these limitations, we have designed an approach called  Tiled-ClickSeq, which uses hundreds of tiled-primers spaced evenly along the virus genome in a single reverse-transcription reaction. The other end of the cDNA amplicon is generated by azido-nucleotides that stochastically terminate cDNA synthesis, removing the need for a paired-primer. A sequencing adaptor containing a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) is appended to the cDNA fragment using click-chemistry and a PCR reaction generates a final NGS library. Tiled-ClickSeq provides complete genome coverage, including the 5UTR, at high depth and specificity to the virus on both Illumina and Nanopore NGS platforms. Here, we analyze multiple SARS-CoV-2 isolates and clinical samples to simultaneously characterize minority variants, sub-genomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs), structural variants (SVs) and D-RNAs. Tiled-ClickSeq therefore provides a convenient and robust platform for SARS-CoV-2 genomics that captures the full range of RNA species in a single, simple assay.",

Combining cell-type specific anatomical tracing, high-throughput RNA-sequencing based projection mapping and optogenetics aided circuit mapping, we show that these projections have a unique topography and target hippocampal pyramidal cells and interneurons.

    "abstract": "Seasonality is a ubiquitous feature of wildlife disease ecology, but is determined by a complex interplay of environmental, parasitological and host factors. Gastrointestinal parasites often exhibit strong seasonal dynamics in wild vertebrate populations due to, for example, environmental influences on free-living or vectored life stages, and variation in the physiological and immune status of hosts across their annual cycle. At the same time, wild populations are typically infected with multiple parasites. The seasonal dynamics of co-infecting parasites may differ depending on age and reproductive status, and associations among parasites may be driven by short-term within-individual changes or longer-term interactions that are consistent among hosts. Here, we used faecal samples and egg counts collected repeatedly from individually marked and monitored wild Soay sheep that were part of a long-term study to investigate seasonal dynamics of six gastrointestinal parasite groups (strongyle nematodes, coccidian protozoa, Capillaria, Strongyloides, Nematodirus, and Moniezia). Prevalence and abundance generally tended to be higher spring and summer, and burdens were higher in lambs than adults. Within the highly prevalent strongyle nematode group, we found differences in seasonality of egg counts depending on adult reproductive status. Reproductive ewes had increased counts in spring around the time of birth followed by a drop in abundance in summer, while barren ewes showed little evidence of seasonality. Males showed a sustained rise in egg counts through spring and summer, and sex differences were only strongly apparent in summer. In contrast, in similarly prevalent coccidia we found a peak in faecal oocyst counts in spring but no differences in seasonality among males, barren and pregnant ewes. Using multivariate mixed-effects models, we went on to show that both strongyle and coccidia counts are moderately repeatable across seasons among individuals. We further show that apparent positive correlation between strongyle and coccidia counts was driven by short-term within-individual changes in both parasite burdens rather than long-term among-individual covariation. Overall, our results demonstrate that seasonality varies across demographic and parasite groups and highlight the value of investigating fluctuating susceptibility and exposure over time for understanding epidemiology of a population.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous whole-genome duplication, or autodiploidization, is a common route to adaptation in experimental evolution of haploid budding yeast populations. The rate at which autodiploids fix in these populations appears to vary across strain backgrounds, but the genetic basis of these differences remains poorly characterized. Here we show that the frequency of autodiploidization differs dramatically between two closely related laboratory strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, BY4741 and W303. To investigate the genetic basis of this difference, we crossed these strains to generate hundreds of unique F1 segregants and tested the tendency of each segregant to autodiplodize across hundreds of generations of laboratory evolution. We find that variants in the SSD1 gene are the primary genetic determinant of differences in autodiploidization. We then used multiple laboratory and wild strains of S. cerevisiae to show that clonal populations of strains with a functional copy of SSD1 autodiploidize more frequently in evolution experiments, while knocking out this gene or replacing it with the W303 allele reduces autodiploidization propensity across all genetic backgrounds tested. These results suggest a potential strategy for modifying rates of spontaneous whole-genome duplications in laboratory evolution experiments in haploid budding yeast. They may also have relevance to other settings in which eukaryotic genome stability plays an important role, such as biomanufacturing and the treatment of pathogenic fungal diseases and cancers.",

    "abstract": "With the vast improvements in sequencing technologies and increased number of protocols, sequencing is finding more applications to answer complex biological problems. Thus, the amount of publicly available sequencing data has tremendously increased in repositories such as SRA, EGA, and ENCODE. With any large online database, there is a critical need to accurately document study metadata, such as the source protocol and organism. In some cases, this metadata may not be systematically verified by the hosting sites and may result in a negative influence on future studies. Here we present SeqWho, a program designed to heuristically assess the quality of sequencing files and reliably classify the organism and protocol type. This is done in an alignment-free algorithm that leverages a Random Forest classifier to learn from native biases in k-mer frequencies and repeat sequence identities between different sequencing technologies and species. Here, we show that our method can accurately and rapidly distinguish between human and mouse, nine different sequencing technologies, and both together, 98.32%, 97.86%, and 96.38% of the time in high confidence calls respectively. This demonstrates that SeqWho is a powerful method for reliably checking the identity of the sequencing files used in any pipeline and illustrates the programs ability to leverage k-mer biases.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that the spatial organization of cells within the tumor-immune microenvironment (TiME) of solid tumors influences survival and response to therapy in numerous cancer types. Here, we report results and demonstrate the applicability of quantitative single-cell spatial proteomics analyses in the TiME of primary and recurrent human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors. Single-cell compositions of a nine patient, primary and recurrent (n=18), HNSCC cohort is presented, followed by deeper investigation into the spatial architecture of the TiME and its relationship with clinical variables and progression free survival (PFS). Multiple spatial algorithms were used to quantify the spatial landscapes of immune cells within TiMEs and demonstrate that neoplastic tumor-immune cell spatial compartmentalization, rather than mixing, is associated with longer PFS. Mesenchymal (SMA+) cellular neighborhoods describe distinct immune landscapes associated with neoplastic tumor-immune compartmentalization and improved patient outcomes. Results from this investigation are concordant with studies in other tumor types, suggesting that trends in TiME cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization may be shared across cancers and may provide prognostic value in multiple cancer types.",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposeMembers of the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family are targeted by a significant fraction of the available FDA-approved drugs. However, the physiological role and pharmacological properties of many GPCRs remain unknown, representing untapped potential in drug design. Of particular interest are ~100 less-studied GPCRs known as orphans because their endogenous ligands are unknown. Intriguingly, disease-causing mutations identified in patients, together with animal studies, have demonstrated that many orphan receptors play crucial physiological roles, and thus, represent attractive drug targets.\n\nExperimental ApproachThe majority of deorphanized GPCRs demonstrate coupling to Gi/o, however a limited number of techniques allow the detection of intrinsically small constitutive activity associated with Gi/o protein activation which represents a significant barrier in our ability to study orphan GPCR signaling. Using luciferase reporter assays, we effectively detected constitutive Gs, Gq, and G12/13 protein signaling by unliganded receptors, and introducing various G protein chimeras, we provide a novel, highly-sensitive tool capable of identifying Gi/o coupling in unliganded orphan GPCRs.\n\nKey ResultsUsing this approach, we measured the constitutive activity of the entire class C GPCR family that includes 8 orphan receptors, and a subset of 20 prototypical class A GPCR members, including 11 orphans. Excitingly, this approach illuminated the G protein coupling profile of 8 orphan GPCRs (GPR22, GPR137b, GPR88, GPR156, GPR158, GPR179, GPRC5D, and GPRC6A) previously linked to pathophysiological processes.\n\nConclusion and ImplicationsWe provide a new platform that could be utilized in ongoing studies in orphan receptor signaling and deorphanization efforts.\n\nWhat is already knownO_LIA large group of understudied orphan GPCRs controls a variety of physiological process.\nC_LI\n\nWhat this study addsO_LIA new strategy to identify G protein signaling associated with orphan GPCRs.\nC_LIO_LIIdentification of Gi/o coupling for 8 orphan GPCRs.\nC_LI\n\nWhat is the clinical significanceO_LIMany orphan GPCRs are associated with pathological conditions and represent promising druggable targets.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In pregnancy, adiponectin serves as an endocrine link between maternal adipose tissue, placental function and fetal growth, with low adiponectin promoting placental function and fetal growth. Circulating adiponectin levels are decreased in obese pregnant women and in gestational diabetes, which is believed to contribute to the insulin resistance and increased risk of fetal overgrowth associated with these conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms governing adiponectin secretion from maternal adipose tissues in pregnancy are poorly understood. Using visceral adipose tissue from lean and obese pregnant mice, we show that obesity in pregnancy is associated with adipose tissue inflammation, ER stress, insulin resistance, increased adiponectin ubiquitination and decreased total abundance of adiponectin. Moreover, adiponectin ubiquitination was increased in visceral fat of obese pregnant women as compared to lean pregnant women. We further observed that insulin prevents, whereas ER stress and inflammation promote, adiponectin ubiquitination and degradation in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We have identified key molecular pathways regulating adiponectin secretion in pregnancy. This information will help us better understand the mechanisms controlling maternal insulin resistance and fetal growth in pregnancy and may provide a foundation for the development of strategies aimed at improving adiponectin production in pregnant women with obesity or gestational diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Many sensory systems utilize parallel ON and OFF pathways that signal stimulus increments and decrements, respectively. These pathways consist of ensembles or grids of ON and OFF detectors spanning sensory space. Yet encoding by opponent pathways raises a question: How should grids of ON and OFF detectors be arranged to optimally encode natural stimuli? We investigated this question using a model of the retina guided by efficient coding theory. Specifically, we optimized spatial receptive fields and contrast response functions to encode natural images given noise and constrained firing rates. We find that the optimal arrangement of ON and OFF receptive fields exhibits a transition between aligned and anti-aligned grids. The preferred phase depends on detector noise and the statistical structure of the natural stimuli. These results reveal that noise and stimulus statistics produce qualitative shifts in neural coding strategies and provide novel theoretical predictions for the configuration of opponent pathways in the nervous system.\n\nSignificance StatementAcross a wide variety of species, cells in the retina specialized for signaling either increases (ON) or decreases (OFF) in light represent one of the most basic building blocks of visual computation. These cells coordinate to form mosaics, with each cell responsible for a small, minimally-overlapping portion of visual space, but the ways in which these mosaics could be spatially coordinated with each other are relatively unknown. Here, we show how efficient coding theory, which hypothesizes that the nervous system minimizes the amount of redundant information it encodes, can predict the relative spatial arrangement of ON and OFF mosaics. The most information-efficient arrangements are determined both by levels of noise in the system and the statistics of natural images.",

    "abstract": "Identifying neural substrates of behavior requires defining actions in terms that map onto brain activity. Brain and muscle activity naturally correlate via the output of motor neurons, but apart from simple movements it has been difficult to define behavior in terms of muscle contractions. By mapping the musculature of the pupal fruit fly and comprehensively imaging muscle activation at single cell resolution, we here describe a multiphasic behavioral sequence in Drosophila. Our characterization identifies a previously undescribed behavioral phase and permits extraction of major movements by a convolutional neural network. We deconstruct movements into a syllabary of co-active muscles and identify specific syllables that are sensitive to neuromodulatory manipulations. We find that muscle activity shows considerable variability, which reduces upon neuromodulation. Our work provides a platform for studying whole-animal behavior, quantifying its variability across multiple spatiotemporal scales, and analyzing its neuromodulatory regulation at cellular resolution.",

    "abstract": "Animals can exhibit remarkable reproductive plasticity in response to their social surroundings, with profound fitness consequences. The study of such plasticity in females, particularly in same-sex interactions, has been severely neglected. Here we measured the impact of variation in the pre-mating social environment on reproductive success in females and tested the underlying mechanisms involved. We used the Drosophila melanogaster model system to test the effect of varying female group size prior to mating and deployed physical and genetic methods to manipulate the perception of different social cues and sensory pathways. We found that socially isolated females were significantly more likely to retain unfertilised eggs before mating, but to show the opposite pattern and lay significantly more fertilised eggs in the 24h after mating, in comparison to grouped females. More than 48h of exposure to other females was necessary for this socially-induced plasticity to be expressed. Neither olfactory nor visual cues were involved in mediating these responses. Instead, we found that females detected other females through direct contact with the deposits they leave behind, even in the absence of eggs. The results demonstrate that females show striking reproductive plasticity in response to their social surroundings and that the nature of their plastic reproductive responses, and the cues they use, differ markedly from those of males. The results emphasise the stark contrasts in how each sex realises reproductive success.",

Papers in this area frequently make a call for more integrative research to explore the relationships between the fast-slow continuum (population-level variation in traits) and pace-of-life continuum (ditto at the individual level). Here, using high-resolution demographic models from natural populations of 41 modern human populations, and hundreds of non-human animal populations and plant populations, I show that the fast-slow continuum, while of interest to explore variation in human strategies, should not be the sole focus of attention. Using a phylogenetically corrected principal component analysis, I show that other axes of life history variation show great promise. Specifically, understanding of the mechanisms of inter-specific and intra-specific differences in senescence rates in reproduction and survival, and how species respond to stochastic variation, I argue, should become the focus of my interdisciplinary research. The proposed new axis of demographic buffering-lability emerges as an important one to explain over 20% of variation in human and non-human populations. I show that these axes help predict demographic resilience, and also correlates with human nation per capita GDP and population growth rates.",

Manipulation of epigenetic machinery to influence viral infectivity of host cells is a relatively unexplored area. The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of epigenetic readers have been reported to modulate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we demonstrate apabetalone, the most clinical advanced BET inhibitor, downregulates expression of cell surface receptors involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) in SARS-CoV-2 permissive cells. Moreover, we show that apabetalone inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro to levels comparable to antiviral agents. Taken together, our study supports further evaluation of apabetalone to treat COVID-19, either alone or in combination with emerging therapeutics.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=192 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/432949v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (54K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@127e6c4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9f6d3aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bbfe3borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2ffad8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

First, we employ the abstract framework of evolution equations to enable the study of far-from-equilibrium patterns. Second, we introduce a mechano-chemical model, with the surface on which the pattern forms being dynamic and playing an active role in the pattern formation, effectively replacing the inhibitor.

These hotspots fuel primary productivity and harbor a diverse consortium of heterotrophs. Interactions with associated microbiota can affect the physiology of Trichodesmium, often in ways that have been predicted to support its growth. Recently, it was found that trimethylamine (TMA), a globally-abundant organic N compound, inhibits N2 fixation in cultures of Trichodesmium without impairing growth rate, suggesting that Trichodesmium receives nitrogen from TMA. In this study, 15N-TMA DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) of a Trichodesmium enrichment was employed to further investigate TMA metabolism and determine if TMA-N is incorporated directly or secondarily via cross-feeding facilitated by microbial associates. Herein we identify two members of the marine Roseobacter clade (MRC) of Alphaproteobacteria as the likely metabolizers of TMA and provide genomic evidence that they converted TMA into a more readily available form of N, e.g., NH4+, which was subsequently used by Trichodesmium and the rest of the community. The results implicate microbiome-mediated carbon (C) and N transformations in modulating N2 fixation, and thus highlight the involvement of host-associated heterotrophs in global biogeochemical cycling.",

ICON3 by O3ZONO/M2L, a new disinfection device generating both ozone and negative ions, was selected to assess the potential of this strategy to inactivate different viral isolates of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nTests under controlled laboratory conditions were performed in a system consisting of an ozone-proof airtight plastic box inside a biological safety cabinet, where suspensions of two strains of SARS-CoV-2 were exposed to ozone and negative ions and virucidal activity was measured by means of two complementary methodologies: viral replication capacity and viral titer determination.\n\nThese studies revealed that low concentration ozone (average 3.18 ppm after the peak) inactivated up to >99% of SARS-CoV-2 within 20 minutes of exposure. Under controlled conditions, similar ozone exposure was recreated with ICON3 in different volume rooms (15, 30, 60 m3) where a linear relationship was observed between the room volume and the time of continuous ozone/ions flow required to reach and maintain the desired ozone levels used in the laboratory studies.\n\nThese studies suggest that ICON3 may have the potential for use in the disinfection of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments in the absence of individuals and animals, under properly controlled and monitored safety conditions.",

    "abstract": "Chirality is ubiquitous in nature, with consequences at the cellular and tissue scales. As Escherichia coli colonies expand radially, an orthogonal component of growth creates a pinwheel-like pattern that can be revealed by fluorescent markers. To elucidate the mechanistic basis of this colony chirality, we investigated its link to left-handed, single-cell twisting during E. coli elongation. While chemical and genetic manipulation of cell width altered single-cell twisting handedness, colonies ceased to be chiral rather than switching handedness, and anaerobic growth altered colony chirality without affecting single-cell twisting. Chiral angle increased with increasing temperature even when growth rate decreased. Unifying these findings, we discovered that colony chirality was associated with the propensity for cell filamentation. Inhibition of cell division accentuated chirality under aerobic growth and generated chirality under anaerobic growth. Thus, regulation of cell division is intrinsically coupled to colony chirality, providing a mechanism for tuning macroscale spatial patterning.",

Tethered mucin 1 (MUC1) is highly expressed in airway epithelium, the primary site of IAV replication, and also by other cell types that influence IAV infection, including macrophages. MUC1 has the potential to influence infection dynamics through physical interactions and/or signaling activity, and recent work suggests MUC1 acts as a releasable decoy receptor and anti-inflammatory molecule during IAV infection. Still, the modulation of MUC1 and its impact during viral pathogenesis remains unclear. Thus, we sought to further investigate the interplay between MUC1 and IAV in an in vitro model of primary human airway epithelium (HAE). Our data indicate that a recombinant IAV hemagglutinin (H3) and H3N2 virus can bind endogenous HAE MUC1. We find that infection of HAE cultures with H1N1 or H3N2 IAV strains does not trigger enhanced MUC1 shedding, but instead stimulates an increase in cell-associated MUC1 protein. We observed a similar increase after stimulation with either type I or type III interferon (IFN); however, inhibition of IFN signaling during H1N1 infection only partially abrogated this increase, indicating multiple soluble factors contribute to MUC1 upregulation during the antiviral response. We expanded these findings and demonstrate that in addition to HAE, primary human monocyte-derived macrophages also upregulate MUC1 protein in response to both IFN treatment and conditioned media from IAV-infected HAE cultures. We then developed HAE genetically depleted for MUC1 to determine its impact on IAV pathogenesis, finding that MUC1 knock-out cultures exhibited enhanced viral growth compared to control cultures for several IAV strains. Together, our data support a model whereby MUC1 antagonizes productive uptake of IAV in HAE. Infection then stimulates MUC1 expression on multiple cell types through IFN-dependent and -independent mechanisms that may further impact infection dynamics.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe mucosal surface of the respiratory epithelium is an important site of first contact for viral respiratory pathogens. Large and heavily glycosylated molecules known as tethered mucins extend from the cell surface and may physically restrict access to underlying cells. Recently, one of these tethered mucins, MUC1, has also been shown to influence cell signaling and inflammation. Still, despite its abundance in the airway and multifunctional capability, the role of MUC1 during influenza virus infection in the human respiratory tract remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that influenza virus directly interacts with MUC1 in a physiologically-relevant model of human airway epithelium and find that MUC1 protein expression is elevated throughout the epithelium and in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages in response to important antiviral signals produced during infection. Using genetically-modified human airway cultures lacking MUC1, we then provide evidence of more efficient influenza virus infection in the absence of this mucin. Our data suggest that MUC1 not only physically restricts influenza virus uptake, but also represents a dynamic component of the host response that acts to further stem viral spread.",

    "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are a clinically validated therapeutic option against COVID-19. As rapidly emerging virus mutants are becoming the next major concern in the fight against the global pandemic, it is imperative that these therapeutic treatments provide coverage against circulating variants and do not contribute to development of treatment emergent resistance. To this end, we investigated the sequence diversity of the spike protein and monitored emergence of minor virus variants in SARS-COV-2 isolates found in COVID-19 patients or identified from preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies. This study demonstrates that a combination of non-competing antibodies, REGEN-COV, not only provides full coverage against current variants of concern/interest but also protects against emergence of new such variants and their potential seeding into the population in a clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a worldwide threat with its unusually high transmission rates and rapid evolution into diverse strains. Unlike typical respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 frequently causes systemic infection by breaking the boundaries of the respiratory systems. The development of animal models recapitulating the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is of utmost importance not only for the development of vaccines and antivirals but also for understanding the pathogenesis. However, there has not been developed an animal model for systemic infection of SARS-CoV-2 representing most aspects of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 with systemic symptoms. Here we report that a hamster strain of Phodopus roborovskii SH101, a laboratory inbred hamster strain of P. roborovskii, displayed most symptoms of systemic infection upon SARS-CoV-2 infection as in the case of the human counterpart, unlike current COVID-19 animal models. P. roborovskii SH101 post-infection of SARS-CoV-2 represented most clinical symptoms of COVID-19 such as snuffling, dyspnea, cough, labored breathing, hunched posture, progressive weight loss, and ruffled fur, in addition to high fever following shaking chills. Histological examinations also revealed a serious right-predominated pneumonia as well as slight organ damages in the brain and liver, manifesting systemic COVID-19 cases. Considering the merit of a small animal as well as its clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human, this hamster model seems to provide an ideal tool to investigate COVID-19.\n\nAuthor summaryAlthough the current animal models supported SARS-CoV-2 replication and displayed varying degrees of illness after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the infections of SARS-CoV-2 were mainly limited to the respiratory systems of these animals, including hACE2 transgenic mice, hamsters, ferrets, fruit bats, guinea pigs, African green monkey, Rhesus macaques, and Cynomolgus macaques. While these animal models can be a modest model for the respiratory infection, there is a clear limit for use them in the study of COVID-19 that also displays multiple systemic symptoms. Therefore, the development of an animal model recapitulating COVID-19-specific symptoms such as the right-predominated pneumonia would be the utmost need to overcome the imminent threat posed by COVID-19. We identified a very interesting hamster strain, Phodopus roborovskii SH101, which mimics almost all aspects of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unlike the current animal models, SARS-CoV-2-infected P. roborovskii SH101 not only displayed the symptoms of respiratory infection but also clinical manifestations specific to human COVID-19 such as high fever following shaking chills, serious right-predominated pneumonia, and minor organ damages in the brain and liver.",

Therefore, we have adapted a targeted enrichment protocol in combination with long-read sequencing to efficiently annotate complex genomic regions. Using Cas9 endonuclease activity, segments of the complex KIR gene cluster were enriched and sequenced on an Oxford Nanopore Technologies platform. This provided sufficient coverage to accurately resolve and phase highly complex KIR haplotypes.

    "abstract": "The pathology associated with malaria infection is largely due to the ability of infected human erythrocytes to adhere to a number of receptors on endothelial cells within tissues and organs. This phenomenon is driven by the export of parasite-encoded proteins to the host cell, the exact function of many of which is still unknown. Here we inactivate the function of one of these exported proteins, PFA66, a member of the J-domain protein family. Although parasites lacking this protein were still able to grow in cell culture, we observed severe defects in normal host cell modification, including aberrant morphology of surface knobs, disrupted presentation of the cytoadherence molecule PfEMP1, and a total lack of cytoadherence, despite the presence of the knob associated protein KAHRP. Complementation assays demonstrate that an intact J-domain is required for recovery to a wild-type phenotype and suggest that PFA66 functions in concert with a HSP70 to carry out host cell modification. Strikingly, this HSP70 is likely to be of host origin.\n\nTaken together, our data reveal a role for PFA66 in host cell modification, implicate human HSP70 as also being essential in this process, and uncover a KAHRP-independent mechanism for correct knob biogenesis. Our observations open up exciting new avenues for the development of new anti-malarials.",

    "abstract": "Fate decisions in developing tissues involve cells transitioning between a set of discrete cell states, each defined by a distinct gene expression profile. Geometric models, often referred to as Waddington landscapes, in which developmental paths are given by the gradient and cell states by the minima of the model, are an appealing way to describe differentiation dynamics and developmental decisions. To construct and validate accurate dynamical landscapes, quantitative methods based on experimental data are necessary. To this end we took advantage of the differentiation of neural and mesodermal cells from pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells exposed to different combinations and durations of signalling factors. We developed a principled statistical approach using flow cytometry data to quantify differentiating cell states. Then, using a framework based on Catastrophe Theory and approximate Bayesian computation, we constructed the corresponding dynamical landscape. The result was a quantitative model that accurately predicted the proportions of neural and mesodermal cells differentiating in response to specific signalling regimes. Analysis of the geometry of the landscape revealed two distinct ways in which cells make a binary choice between one of two fates. We discuss the biological relevance of these mechanisms and suggest that they represent general archetypal designs for developmental decisions. Taken together, the approach we describe is broadly applicable for the quantitative analysis of differentiation dynamics and for determining the logic of developmental cell fate decisions.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate rhythmic motor behaviour is generated by the central pattern generator (CPG) located in the spinal cord. However, the development of the CPG has not been elucidated at the single-neuron level. We found that a single pair of motor neurons (A10.64/MN2) constitutes the CPG and regulates rhythmic early motor behaviour in the proto-chordate, Ciona. This pair of cells exhibited Ca2+ oscillation with an 80-sec interval at the mid-tailbud stage and 25 sec at the late tailbud stage. The Ca2+ oscillation occurred independently in a dissociated single cell. In the late tailbud stage, the Ca2+ oscillation began to coincide in phase with the ipsilateral tail muscle contraction, which corresponds to rhythmic early motor behaviour. Interestingly, the number and frequency of tail muscle contractions gradually coincided with spikes in the burst of membrane potential as the embryos developed toward late tailbud stage. Photoablation of A10.64/MN2 abolished the rhythmic early motor behaviour. These findings indicate that the early spontaneous rhythmic motor behaviour of Ciona is directly regulated by A10.64/MN2 as an essential component of the CPG. Our findings shed light on the development and evolution of chordate rhythmic behaviours.",

    "abstract": "Proteostatic stress initiates a transcriptional response that is unique to the stress condition, yet the regulatory mechanisms underlying the distinct gene expression patterns observed in stressed cells remains unknown. Using a functional genomic approach, we investigated how activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), a key transcription factor in the unfolded protein response (UPR), regulates target genes. We first designed a computational strategy to define Atf6 target genes based on the evolutionary conservation of predicted ATF6 binding in gene promoters, identifying 652 conserved putative Atf6 target (CPAT) genes. CPATs were overrepresented for genes functioning in the UPR, however, the majority functioned in cellular processes unrelated to proteostasis, including small molecule metabolism and development. Functional studies of stress-independent and toxicant based Atf6 activation in zebrafish livers showed that the pattern of CPAT expression in response to Atf6 overexpression, alcohol and arsenic was unique. Only 34 CPATs were differentially expressed in all conditions, indicating that Atf6 is sufficient to regulate a small subset of CPATs. Blocking Atf6 using Ceapins in zebrafish demonstrated that Atf6 is necessary for activation of these genes in response to arsenic. We investigated CPAT during physiologically mediated hepatocyte stress using liver regeneration in mice as a model. Over half of all CPATs were differentially expressed during this process. This was attributed to the permissive chromatin environment in quiescent livers on the promoters of these genes, characterized by the absence of H3K27me3 and enrichment of H3K4me3. Taken together, these data uncover a complex transcriptional response to Atf6 activation and implicate a permissive epigenome as a mechanism by which distinct transcriptional responses are regulated by Atf6.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Membrane (M) gene are relatively uncommon. The M gene encodes the most abundant viral structural protein, and is implicated in multiple viral functions, including initial attachment to the host cell via heparin sulfate proteoglycan, viral protein assembly in conjunction with the N and E genes, and enhanced glucose transport. We have identified a recent spike in the frequency of reported SARS-CoV-2 genomes carrying M gene mutations. This is associated with emergence of a new sub-B.1 clade defined by the previously unreported M:I82T mutation within TM3, the third of three membrane spanning helices implicated in glucose transport. The frequency of this mutation increased in the USA from 0.014% in October 2020 to 1.62% in February 2021, a 116-fold change. While constituting 0.7% of the isolates overall, M:I82T sub-B.1 lineage accounted for 14.4% of B.1 lineage isolates in February 2021, similar to the rapid initial increase previously seen with the B.1.1.7 and B.1.429 lineages, which quickly became the dominant lineages in Europe and California over a period of several months. A similar increase in incidence was also noted in another related mutation, V70L, also within the TM2 transmembrane helix. The rapid emergence of this sub-B.1 clade with recurrent I82T mutation suggests that this M gene mutation is more biologically fit, perhaps related to glucose uptake during viral replication, and should be included in ongoing genomic surveillance efforts and warrants further evaluation for potentially increased pathogenic and therapeutic implications.",

    "abstract": "Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) is important for gene silencing and imprinting, (epi)genome organization and organismal development. In a prevalent model, the functional readout of H3K27me3 in mammalian cells is achieved through the H3K27me3-recognizing chromodomain harbored within the chromobox (CBX) component of canonical Polycomb repressive complex 1 (cPRC1), which induces chromatin compaction and gene repression. Here, we report that binding of H3K27me3 by a Bromo Adjacent Homology (BAH) domain harbored within BAH domain-containing protein 1 (BAHD1) is required for overall BAHD1 targeting to chromatin and for optimal repression of the H3K27me3-demarcated genes in mammalian cells. Disruption of direct interaction between BAHD1BAH and H3K27me3 by point mutagenesis leads to chromatin remodeling, notably, increased histone acetylation, at its Polycomb gene targets. Mice carrying an H3K27me3-interaction-defective mutation of Bahd1BAH causes marked embryonic lethality, showing a requirement of this pathway for normal development.

    "abstract": "Mycobacteriophages are viruses of Mycobacterium spp. with promising diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Phage genome exploration and characterization of their proteomes are essential to gain a better understanding of their role in phage biology. So far, about 2014 mycobacteriophages have been genomically defined and 1563 phage protein families (phamilies) are identified. However, the function of only a fraction (about 15%) is known and a majority of ORFs in phage genomes are hypothetical proteins. In this study, from the annotated genome of a F1 cluster mycobacteriophage SimranZ1, a putative AAA ATPase (Gp65, Pham 9410) is characterized as a DNA-dependent ATPase. Sequence-based functional annotation predicted Gp65 to belong to the P-loop NTPase superfamily, having AAA_24 and RecA/RadA domains which are known to be involved in ATP-dependent DNA repair/maintenance mechanism. On molecular docking, Gly21 and Ser23 of Gp65 showed specific binding with ATP. Using a microtiter plate assay, ATPase activity of Gp65 was experimentally verified which was found to increase in the presence of dsDNA. Gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing condition showed the oligomeric states of Gp65 and Transmission Electron Microscopy revealed it to exist as a hexamer having a prominent central pore with a diameter of 1.9 nm. In summary, functional characterization of Gp65 as a DNA dependent AAA ATPase indicates its role in DNA repair/maintenance mechanism in mycobacteriophages.",

    "abstract": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a translational recoding mechanism that enables the synthesis of multiple polypeptides from a single transcript. In the alphavirus structural polyprotein, -1PRF is coordinated by a \"slippery\" sequence in the transcript, an RNA stem-loop, and a conformational transition in the nascent polypeptide chain. To characterize each of these effectors, we measured the effects of 4,530 mutations on -1PRF by deep mutational scanning. While most mutations within the slip-site and stem-loop disrupt -1PRF, mutagenic effects upstream of the slip-site are far more variable. Molecular dynamics simulations of polyprotein biogenesis suggest many of these mutations alter stimulatory forces on the nascent chain through their effects on translocon-mediated cotranslational folding. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting the coupling between cotranslational folding and -1PRF depends on the translation kinetics upstream of the slip-site. These findings demonstrate how -1PRF is coordinated by features within both the transcript and nascent chain.",

It is vital to identify the cell types that respond to the induction stimulus to understand the pre-adipocyte potential and the mature adipocyte behavior. To test this hypothesis, we deconvoluted the gene expression profiles of the cell culture of MDI-induced 3T3-L1 cells. Then we estimated the fractions of the sub-populations and their changes in time. We characterized the sub-populations based on their specific expression profiles. Initial cell cultures comprised three distinct phenotypes. A small fraction of the starting cells responded to the induction and developed into mature adipocytes. Unresponsive cells were probably under structural constraints or were committed to differentiating into alternative phenotypes. Using the same population gene markers, similar proportions were found in induced human primary adipocyte cell cultures. The three sub-populations had diverse responses to treatment with various drugs and compounds. Only the response of the maturating sub-population resembled that estimated from the profiles of the mixture. We then showed that even at a low division rate, a small fraction of cells could increase its share in a dynamic two-populations model. Finally, we used a cell cycle expression index to validate that model. To sum, pre-adipocytes are a mixture of different cells of which a limited fraction become mature adipocytes.",

    "abstract": "Transcription machinery depends on the temporal formation of protein-DNA complexes. Recent experiments demonstrated that lifetime of the complex can also affect transcription. In parallel, in vitro single-molecule studies showed that nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) leave the DNA rapidly as the bulk concentration of the protein increases via facilitated dissociation (FD). Never-theless, whether such concentration-dependent mechanism is functional in a bacterial cell, in which NAP levels and the 3D chromosomal structure are often coupled, is not clear a priori. Here, by using extensive coarse-grained molecular simulations, we model the unbinding of specific and nonspecific dimeric NAPs from a high-molecular-weight circular DNA molecule in a cylindrical structure mimicking the cellular confinement of a bacterial chromosome. Our simulations show that physiologically relevant peak protein levels (tens of micromolar) lead to highly compact chromosomal structures. This compaction results in rapid off rates (shorter DNA-residence times) but only for specifically DNA-binding NAPs such as the factor for inversion stimulation (Fis). Contrarily, for nonspecific NAPs, the off rates decrease as the protein levels increase, suggesting an inverse FD pattern. The simulations with restrained chromosome models reveal that this inverse response is due to DNA-segmental fluctuations, and that chromosomal compaction is in favor of faster protein dissociation. Overall, our results indicate that cellular-concentration level of a structural DNA-binding protein can be highly intermingled with its DNA-residence time.",

    "abstract": "Systematic analysis of calorie restriction (CR) mechanisms and pathways in cancer biology has not been carried out, leaving therapeutic benefits unclear. Using a systems biology approach and metadata analysis, we studied gene expression changes in the response of normal mouse duodenum mucosa (DM) to short-term (2-weeks) 25% CR as a biological model. We found a high similarity of gene expression profiles in human and mouse DM tissues. Surprisingly, 26% of the 467 CR responding differential expressed genes (DEGs) in mice consist of cancer-associated genes--most never studied in CR contexts. The DEGs were enriched with over-expressed cell cycle, oncogenes, and metabolic reprogramming pathways (MRP) that determine tissue-specific tumorigenesis, cancer, and stem cell activation; tumor suppressors and apoptosis genes were under-expressed. DEG enrichments suggest a misbalance in telomere maintenance and activation of metabolic pathways playing dual (anti-cancer and pro-oncogenic) roles. Immune system genes (ISGs) consist of 37% of the total DEGs; the majority of ISGs are suppressed, including cell-autonomous immunity and tumor immune evasion controls. Thus, CR induces MRP suppressing multiple immune mechanics and activating oncogenic pathways, potentially driving pre-malignant and cancer states. These findings change the paradigm regarding the anti-cancer role of CR and may initiate specific treatment target development.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds is an example of parallel evolution, through which genes encoding herbicide target proteins are repeatedly represented as evolutionary targets. The number of herbicide target-site genes differs among species, and little is known regarding the effects of duplicate gene copies on the evolution of herbicide resistance. We investigated the evolution of herbicide resistance in Monochoria vaginalis, which carries five copies of sulfonylurea target-site acetolactate synthase (ALS) genes. Suspected resistant populations collected across Japan were investigated for herbicide sensitivity and ALS gene sequences, followed by functional characterisation and ALS gene expression analysis. We identified over 60 resistant populations, all of which carried resistance-conferring amino acid substitutions exclusively in MvALS1 or MvALS3. All MvALS4 alleles carried a loss-of-function mutation. Although the enzymatic properties of ALS encoded by these genes were not markedly different, the expression of MvALS1 and MvALS3 was prominently higher among all ALS genes. The higher expression of MvALS1 and MvALS3 is the driving force of the biased representation of genes during the evolution of herbicide resistance in M. vaginalis. Our findings highlight that gene expression is a key factor in creating evolutionary hotspots.",

However, the signal that triggers the formation of the pyrenoid has remained elusive. Here, we show that, in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the pyrenoid is strongly induced by hyperoxia, even at high CO2 or bicarbonate levels. These results suggest that the pyrenoid can be induced by a common product of photosynthesis specific to low CO2 or hyperoxia. Consistent with this view, the photorespiratory by-product, H2O2, induced the pyrenoid, suggesting that it acts as a signal. Finally, we show evidence for linkages between genetic variations in hyperoxia tolerance, H2O2 signaling, and pyrenoid morphologies.",

    "abstract": "Many goals in synthetic biology, including the elucidation and refactoring of biosynthetic pathways and the engineering of regulatory circuits and networks, require knowledge of protein function. In plants, the prevalence of large gene families means it can be particularly challenging to link specific functions to individual proteins. However, protein characterisation has remained a technical bottleneck, often requiring significant effort to optimise expression and purification protocols. To leverage the ability of biofoundries to accelerate design-built-test-learn cycles, we present a workflow for automated DNA assembly and cell-free expression of plant proteins that accelerates optimisation and enables rapid progression to characterisation. First, we developed a phytobrick-compatible Golden Gate DNA assembly toolbox containing plasmid acceptors for cell-free expression using E. coli or wheat germ lysates as well as a set of N- and C-terminal tag parts for detection, purification, and improved expression/folding. We next optimised automated assembly of miniaturised cell-free reactions using an acoustic liquid handling platform and then compared tag configurations to identify those that increase expression. We additionally developed a luciferase-based system for rapid quantification that requires a minimal 11 aa tag and demonstrate facile removal of tags following synthesis. Finally, we show that several functional characterisation experiments can be performed with cell-free protein synthesis reactions without the need for protein purification. Together, the combination of automated assembly of DNA parts and cell-free expression reactions should significantly increase the throughput of experiments to test and understand plant protein function and enable the direct reuse of DNA parts in downstream plant engineering workflows.",

However, the role of Bregs in case of postmenopausal osteoporosis remains unknown. Also, no study till date have ever investigated the significance of Bregs in modulating osteoclastogenesis. In the present study, we for the first time examined the anti-osteoclastogenic potential of Bregs under in vitro conditions and we observed that Bregs suppressed RANKL mediated osteoclastogenesis in bone marrow cells in a dose dependent manner. We further elucidated the mechanism behind the suppression of osteoclasts differentiation by Bregs and found that Bregs inhibit osteoclastogenesis via IL-10 production. To further confirm the bone health modulating potential of Bregs we employed post-menopausal osteoporotic mice model. Remarkably, our in vivo data clearly suggest a significant reduction (p < 0.01) in both CD19+IL-10+ and CD19+CD1dhiCD5+IL-10+ B10 Bregs in case of osteoporotic mice model. Moreover, our serum cytokine data further confirms the significant reduction of IL-10 levels in osteoporotic mice. Taken together, the present study for the first time unravels and establish the unexplored role of regulatory B cells in case of osteoporosis and provide new insight into Bregs biology in the context of post-menopausal osteoporosis.",

In yeast, retromer and Snx4 coat complexes are recruited to the endosomal surface where they recognize cargos. They sort cargo and deform the membrane into recycling tubules that bud from the endosome and target to the Golgi. Here, we reveal that the SNX-BAR protein, Mvp1, mediates an endosomal recycling pathway which is mechanistically distinct from the retromer and Snx4 pathways. Mvp1 deforms the endosomal membrane and sorts cargos containing a specific sorting motif into a membrane tubule. Subsequently, Mvp1 recruits the dynamin-like GTPase Vps1 to catalyze membrane scission and release of the recycling tubule. Similarly, SNX8, the human homolog of Mvp1, which has been also implicated in Alzheimers disease, mediates formation of an endosomal recycling tubule.

And the levels of ITG 6 expression were increased in the NP tissue from IVDD patients and IVDD rat model with mild degeneration, which were reduced as degeneration degree increases. Further studies found that ITG 6 could protect NP cells against HOT-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress, and protect NP cells from HOT-inhibited ECM proteins synthesis. ITG 6 upregulation by HOT contributed to maintain a NP tissue homeostasis through the interaction with hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). Furthermore, silencing of ITG 6 in vivo could obviously accelerate puncture-induced IVDD.

To date, no studies have directly quantified the effect of rye cover crops on P. syringae populations, nor on the bacterial community of squash leaves. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that the protective effects of cover cropping on squash may be mediated by cover cropping effects on the plants microbiota that in turn protects against P. syringae. Using combined 16S sequencing and culture-based approaches, we showed that rye cover cropping protects squash against P. syringae, by decreasing pathogen population size on squash leaves and increasing fruit health and marketability at harvest. We also found evidence of a strong effect of rye cover crops on bacterial communities of the squash phyllosphere. Those findings were more striking early in the growing season. Finally, we identified numerous phyllosphere bacteria belonging to the genera Sphingomonas, Methylobacterium and Pseudomonas that were promoted by rye cover crops. Overall, our findings suggest cover cropping is effective for the sustainable management of P. syringae on squash and may provide a reservoir of potential microbial biocontrol agents colonizing the phyllosphere.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial genome encodes core subunits involved in the process of oxidative phosphorylation. The sequence and structure of these mitochondria-encoded polypeptides are expected to be shaped by bioenergetic requirements linked to diet and environment. Here, we have developed a robust and effective method for highlighting phylogenetic tree edges with unexpectedly rapid, and likely consequential, substitutions within mitochondrial proteins. Further, our approach allows detection of discrete protein substitutions likely to alter enzyme performance. A survey of mammalian taxonomic groups performed using our method indicates that widely conserved residues in mitochondria-encoded proteins are more likely to rapidly mutate toward variants providing lower OXPHOS activity within specific clades. Intriguingly, our data suggest reduced cellular metabolism of ancestral anthropoids, and our findings have potential implications regarding primate encephalization.\n\nSignificance StatementMitochondria harbor DNA (mtDNA) that encodes proteins important for converting food into energy. The environment and lifestyle of an organism shapes, and is shaped by, the sequences of these mitochondrial genomes. We developed a new approach for the detection of rapid functional change to proteins, and we applied our method to the mitochondria-encoded polypeptides of mammals. We found that primates displayed a general signature of relative hypometabolism that is shared with other mammals characterized by a low metabolic rate. Indications of reduced cellular metabolism extend even to the earliest anthropoids. Our findings have potential implications regarding the evolution of an enlarged primate brain.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell high-throughput chromatin conformation capture methodologies (scHi-C) enable profiling long-range genomic interactions at the single-cell resolution; however, data from these technologies are prone to technical noise and bias that, when unaccounted for, hinder downstream analysis. Here we developed a fast band normalization approach, BandNorm, and a deep generative modeling framework, 3DVI, to explicitly account for scHi-C specific technical biases. We present robust performances of BandNorm and 3DVI compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. BandNorm is effective in separating cell types, identification of interaction features, and recovery of cell-cell relationship, whereas de-noising by 3DVI successfully enables 3D compartments and domains recovery, especially for rare cell types.",

    "abstract": "Transcription elongation factor A (TCEA) is a eukaryotic transcriptional molecule, required for a formation of initiation and elongation of gene transcription-mediated RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complex, to promote transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) after RNAPII backtracking recovery. TCEA shares three isoforms in which TCEA1 is ubiquitously expressed among all eukaryotic cells. We found a spermatogenesis TCEA1 and TCEA2 expression profile has a unique transcriptional programme, compared with embryogenesis. Moreover, the testis-specific TCEA2 profile correlates with gene transcription, whereas TCEA1 specifically correlates with genes transcribed for Nuclear excision repair (NER) during human spermatogenesis. We also found that the expression activation of RNF20, a TCEA1 inhibitor, leads to expressional TCEA1 reduction, but having no direct impact on TCEA2 expression, implying the potential RNF20-dependent transcriptional switching of TCEA2 in transcriptional regulation during spermatogenesis. Our analysis defined a transcriptional bursting event where transcription-coupled repair (both Base excision repair and Nuclear excision repair) is a major pathway highly expressed in early spermatogenesis, supporting the transcriptional scanning hypothesis of which mutation of transcribed genes is effectively repaired as proposed by Xia B., et al.

We found that the populations of neurons in dorsal CA1 had a higher dimensionality and showed more complex patterns of activity, translating to more information being encoded, as compared ensembles in vCA1. Furthermore, a pairwise maximum entropy model was better at predicting the structure of global patterns of activity in ventral CA1 as compared to dorsal CA1.

    "abstract": "Maternally transmitted endosymbionts can negatively influence the reproduction of their arthropod hosts (e.g. male-killing, cytoplasmic incompatibility). However, such infections are rarely assessed in insect models such as Sepsidae or Drosophilidae that are routinely used in sexual selection studies. To detect infection and bacterial localisation in the host, we developed and optimised a tissue-specific multiplex screening protocol for Wolbachia, Cardinium and Rickettsia that can be completed in a day. The robustness of the protocol was tested with the screening of multiple species and populations of flies commonly used in reproductive studies (N=147 flies; n=426 tissues). With triplex PCRs and more effective duplex PCRs, we detected both single and co-infections in most individuals from both families (Drosophilidae | Sepsidae; Single infection: 51.4% | 62.7%; Dual infection: 29.2% | 9.3%; Triple infection: 4.2% | 0%). Surprisingly, we documented the presence of all three reproductive bacteria in 32 wild-caught drosophilids from Singapore. Also, we note that most sepsid populations (19 out of 22) tested positive for Cardinium. We found that the Rickettsia infection was overall low, but it was predominantly detected in the gastrointestinal tract instead of the reproductive tract, suggesting a potential horizontal transmission. Finally, we found that amplicon sequences of equivalent sizes between the three tissues from the same individuals share at least 98.8% identity, which suggests that the same endosymbiont strain inhabits within the whole arthropod. Overall, we believe this protocol is effective in detecting co-infections and understanding the transmission of various reproductive endosymbionts. It can also be used to assess endosymbiont infections in other insects.",

    "abstract": "The iris of the eye shows striking color variation across vertebrate species, and may play important roles in crypsis and communication. The domestic pigeon (Columba livia) has three common iris colors, orange, pearl (white), and bull (dark brown), segregating in a single species, thereby providing a unique opportunity to identify the genetic basis of iris coloration. We used comparative genomics and genetic mapping in laboratory crosses to identify two candidate genes that control variation in iris color in domestic pigeons. We identified a nonsense mutation in the solute carrier SLC2A11B that is shared among all pigeons with pearl eye color, and a locus associated with bull eye color that includes EDNRB2, a gene involved in neural crest migration and pigment development. However, bull eye is likely controlled by a heterogeneous collection of alleles across pigeon breeds. We also found that the EDNRB2 region is associated with regionalized plumage depigmentation (piebalding). Our results establish a genetic link between iris and plumage color, two traits that were long known by pigeon breeders to co-occur, and demonstrate the importance of gene duplicates in establishing possibilities and constraints in the evolution of color and color pattern among vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "There has been considerable interest in the use of red seaweed, and in particular Asparagopsis taxiformis, to increase production of cattle and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We hypothesized that feeding seaweed or seaweed derived products would increase beef or dairy cattle performance as indicated by average daily gain (ADG), feed efficiency measures, milk production, and milk constituents, and reduce methane emissions. We used meta-analytical methods to evaluate these hypotheses. A comprehensive search of Google Scholar, Pubmed and ISI Web of Science produced 14 experiments from which 23 comparisons of treatment effects could be evaluated. Red seaweed (A. taxiformis) and brown seaweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) were the dominant seaweeds used. There were no effects of treatment on ADG or dry matter intake (DMI). There was an increase in efficiency for feed to gain by 0.41 {+/-} 0.22 kg per kg [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.70 {+/-} 0.35; P = 0.001], but not for gain to feed (P = 0.215), although the direction of the change was for improved efficiency. The type of seaweed used was not a significant covariable for ADG and DMI. Milk production was increased with treatment on weighted mean difference (WMD; 1.35 {+/-} 0.44 kg/d; P <0.001); however, the SMD of 0.45 was not significant (P = 0.111). Extremely limited data suggest the possibility of increased percentages of milk fat (P = 0.040) and milk protein (P = 0.001) on DerSimonian and Laird (D&L) WMD evaluation. The limited data available indicate dietary supplementation with seaweed produced a significant and substantial reduction in methane yield by 5.28 {+/-} 3.5 g/kg DMI (P = 0.003) on D&L WMD evaluation and a D&L SMD of -1.70 (P = 0.001); however, there was marked heterogeneity in the results (I2 > 80%). In one comparison, methane yield was reduced by 97%. We conclude that while there was evidence of potential for benefit from seaweed use to improve production and reduce methane yield more in vivo experiments are required to strengthen the evidence of effect and identify sources of heterogeneity in methane response, while practical applications and potential risks are evaluated for seaweed use.",

    "abstract": "Altering cortical activity using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to improve working memory (WM) performance. Due to large inter-experimental variability in the tDCS montage configuration and strength of induced electric fields, results have been mixed. Here, we present a novel meta-analytic method relating behavioral effect sizes to electric field strength to identify brain regions underlying largest tDCS-induced WM improvement. Simulations on 69 studies targeting left prefrontal cortex showed that tDCS electric field strength in lower dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 45/47) relates most strongly to improved WM performance. This region explained 7.8% of variance, equaling a medium effect. A similar region was identified when correlating WM performance and electric field strength of right prefrontal tDCS studies (n = 18). Maximum electric field strength of five previously used tDCS configurations were outside of this location. We thus propose a new tDCS montage which maximizes the tDCS electric field strength in that brain region. Our findings can benefit future tDCS studies that aim to affect WM function.\n\nHighlights- We summarize the effect of 87 tDCS studies on working memory performance\n- We introduce a new meta-analytic method correlating tDCS electric fields and performance\n- tDCS-induced electric fields in lower DLPFC correlate significantly with improved working memory\n- The lower DLPFC was not maximally targeted by most tDCS montages and we provide an optimized montage",

    "abstract": "Body hair is a defining mammalian characteristic, but several mammals, such as whales, naked mole-rats, and humans, have notably less hair than others. To find the genetic basis of reduced hair quantity, we used our evolutionary-rates-based method, RERconverge, to identify coding and noncoding sequences that evolve at significantly different rates in so-called hairless mammals compared to hairy mammals. Using RERconverge, we performed an unbiased, genome-wide scan over 62 mammal species using 19,149 genes and 343,598 conserved noncoding regions to find genetic elements that evolve at significantly different rates in hairless mammals compared to hairy mammals. We show that these rate shifts resulted from relaxation of evolutionary constraint on hair-related sequences in hairless species. In addition to detecting known and potential novel hair-related genes, we also discovered hundreds of putative hair-related regulatory elements. Computational investigation revealed that genes and their associated noncoding regions show different evolutionary patterns and influence different aspects of hair growth and development. Many genes under accelerated evolution are associated with the structure of the hair shaft itself, while evolutionary rate shifts in noncoding regions also included the dermal papilla and matrix regions of the hair follicle that contribute to hair growth and cycling. Genes that were top-ranked for coding sequence acceleration included known hair and skin genes KRT2, KRT35, PKP1, and PTPRM that surprisingly showed no signals of evolutionary rate shifts in nearby noncoding regions. Conversely, accelerated noncoding regions are most strongly enriched near regulatory hair-related genes and microRNAs, such as mir205, ELF3, and FOXC1, that themselves do not show rate shifts in their protein-coding sequences. Such dichotomy highlights the interplay between the evolution of protein sequence and regulatory sequence to contribute to the emergence of a convergent phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled the unbiased, high-throughput quantification of gene expression specific to cell types and states. With the cost of scRNA-seq decreasing and techniques for sample multiplexing improving, population-scale scRNA-seq, and thus single-cell expression quantitative trait locus (sc-eQTL) mapping, is increasingly feasible. Mapping of sc-eQTL provides additional resolution to study the regulatory role of common genetic variants on gene expression across a plethora of cell types and states, and promises to improve our understanding of genetic regulation across tissues in both health and disease. While previously established methods for bulk eQTL mapping can, in principle, be applied to sc-eQTL mapping, there are a number of open questions about how best to process scRNA-seq data and adapt bulk methods to optimise sc-eQTL mapping. Here, we evaluate the role of different normalisation and aggregation strategies, covariate adjustment techniques, and multiple testing correction methods to establish best practice guidelines. We use both real and simulated datasets across single-cell technologies to systematically assess the impact of these different statistical approaches and provide recommendations for future single-cell eQTL studies that can yield up to twice as many eQTL discoveries as default approaches ported from bulk studies.",

Directed functional connectivity measures, such as the Generalized Partial Directed Coherence (GPDC), provide estimates of the causal influence between areas. However, the relation between causality estimates and structural connectivity is still not clear. We analyzed this problem by evaluating the effectiveness of GPDC to estimate the connectivity of a ground-truth, data-constrained computational model of a large-scale network model of the mouse cortex. The model contains 19 cortical areas comprised of spiking neurons, with areas connected by long-range projections with weights obtained from a tract-tracing cortical connectome. We show that GPDC values provide a reasonable estimate of structural connectivity, with an average Pearson correlation over simulations of 0.74. Moreover, even in a typical electrophysiological recording scenario containing five areas, the mean correlation was above 0.6. These results suggest that it may be possible to empirically estimate structural connectivity from functional connectivity even when detailed whole-brain recordings are not achievable.",

    "abstract": "Computing global motion direction of extended visual objects is a hallmark of primate high-level vision. Although neurons selective for global motion have also been found in mouse visual cortex, it remains unknown whether rodents can combine multiple motion signals into global, integrated percepts. To address this question, we trained two groups of rats to discriminate either gratings (G group) or plaids (i.e., superpositions of gratings with different orientations; P group) drifting horizontally along opposite directions. After the animals learned the task, we applied a visual priming paradigm, where presentation of the target stimulus was preceded by the brief presentation of either a grating or a plaid. The extent to which rat responses to the targets were biased by such prime stimuli provided a measure of the spontaneous, perceived similarity between primes and targets. We found that gratings and plaids, when uses as primes, were equally effective at biasing the perception of plaid direction for the rats of the P group. Conversely, for G group, only the gratings acted as effective prime stimuli, while the plaids failed to alter the perception of grating direction. To interpret these observations, we simulated a decision neuron reading out the representations of gratings and plaids, as conveyed by populations of either component or pattern cells (i.e., local or global motion detectors). We concluded that the findings for the P group are highly consistent with the existence of a population of pattern cells, playing a functional role similar to that demonstrated in primates. We also explored different scenarios that could explain the failure of the plaid stimuli to elicit a sizable priming magnitude for the G group. These simulations yielded testable predictions about the properties of motion representations in rodent visual cortex at the single-cell and circuitry level, thus paving the way to future neurophysiology experiments.",

    "abstract": "Model systems that recapitulate the complexity of human tumors and the reality of variable treatment responses are urgently needed to better understand cancer biology and to develop more effective cancer therapies. Here we report development and characterization of a large bank of patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and matched organoid cultures from tumors that represent some of the greatest unmet needs in breast cancer research and treatment. These include endocrine-resistant, treatment-refractory, and metastatic breast cancers and, in some cases, multiple tumor collections from the same patients. The models can be grown long-term with high fidelity to the original tumors. We show that development of matched PDX and PDX-derived organoid (PDxO) models facilitates high-throughput drug screening that is feasible and cost-effective, while also allowing in vivo validation of results. Our data reveal consistency between drug screening results in organoids and drug responses in breast cancer PDX. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of using these patient-derived models for precision oncology in real time with patient care, using a case of a triple negative breast cancer with early metastatic recurrence as an example. Our results uncovered an FDA-approved drug with high efficacy against the models. Treatment with the PDxO-directed therapy resulted in a complete response for the patient and a progression-free survival period more than three times longer than her previous therapies. This work provides valuable new methods and resources for functional precision medicine and drug development for human breast cancer.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=189 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/433268v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@134d5cdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c0a419org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@556a4forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b68c9c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Differentiation and proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) are both important biological processes in cerebral neural network. However, these two capacities of NSCs are limited. Thus, the induction of differentiation and/or proliferation via administration of small molecules derived from natural plants can be considered as a potential approach to repair damaged neural networks. This paper reports that gallic acid, a catechol compound selected from derivatives of methyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (MDHB), selectively induces NSCs to differentiate into immature neurons and promotes proliferation by activating phosphorylation of key proteins in the MAPK-ERK pathway. In addition, we found that 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid was the main active structure which could show neurotrophic activity. The substitution of carboxyl group on the benzene ring into ester group may promote differentiation on the basis of the structure of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. Meanwhile, the introduction of 5-hydroxyl group may promote proliferation. Generally, this study identified a natural catechol compound that promotes differentiation and proliferation of NSCs in vitro.",

    "abstract": "The origin and evolution of insect wings remain enigmatic after a century-long discussion. Molecular dissection of wing development in hemimetabolous insects, in which the first functional wings evolved, is key to understand genetic changes required for wing evolution. We investigated Drosophila wing marker genes in the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus, and found apterous and vestigial show critical functions in nymphal tergal identity and margin formation, respectively. We further demonstrate that margin cells in the lateral-anterior tergal region constitute a growth organizer of wing blades. Transcriptome and RNAi analyses unveiled that Wnt, Fat-Dachsous, and Hippo pathways are involved in disproportional growth of Gryllus wings. Our data collectively support the idea that tergal margin cells of a wingless ancestor gave rise to the body wall extension required for evolution of the first powered flight.",

    "abstract": "Eye movement behavior, which provides the visual information acquisition and processing, plays an important role in performing sensorimotor tasks, such as driving, by human beings in everyday life. In the procedure of performing sensorimotor tasks, eye movement is contributed through a specific coordination of head and eye in gaze changes, with head motions preceding eye movements. Notably we believe that this coordination in essence indicates a kind of causality. In this paper, we investigate transfer entropy to set up a quantity for measuring an unidirectional causality from head motion to eye movement. A normalized version of the proposed measure, demonstrated by virtual reality based psychophysical studies, behaves very well as a proxy of driving performance, suggesting that quantitative exploitation of coordination of head and eye may be an effective behaviometric of sensorimotor activity.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthrithis (OA) is an endemic disease due to the increase of the worlds elderly population. Previously thought to be a consequence of an imbalance between cartilage degradation and biosynthesis, it is now recognized as a disease also involving inflammation, hence influencing the level of inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and chemokines. Lubricin is a mucin type molecule where its OA induced glycosylation truncation propels a deteriorating lubrication of the articular cartilage. The objective of this study was to explore the OA driven truncation of O-linked glycosylation of synovial lubricin and its cross talk with systemic and local (synovial fluid, SF) inflammation. We compared the systemic level of cytokines/chemokine in OA patients and controls plasma with their local level in SF using a 44 plex screen. The level of 27 cytokines and chemokines was consistently measured in both plasma and SF. The data showed that the levels of cytokines and chemokines in OA plasma display limited correlation to their counterpart in SF. The level of synovial IL-8 and MIP-1 and VEGFA in OA patients, but not their plasma level, where the only cytokines that displayed a significant correlation to the observed lubricin O-linked glycosylation truncation. These cytokines were also shown to be upregulated exposing fibroblast like synoviocytes from healthy and OA patients to recombinant lubricin with truncated glycans mainly consisting of Tn-antigens, while lubricin with sialylated and non-sialylated T anigens did not have any effect. The data suggest that truncated glycans of lubricin, as found in OA, promotes the synovial cytokine production and exerebate the local synovial inflammation.",

We report here the preclinical development of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, ZF2001, which contains tandem-repeat dimeric receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein with alum-based adjuvant. We assessed vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy in both mice and non-human primates (NHPs). ZF2001 induced high levels of RBD-binding and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in both mice and NHPs, and also elicited balanced TH1/TH2 cellular responses in NHPs. Two doses of ZF2001 protected Ad-hACE2-transduced mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as detected by reduced viral RNA and relieved lung injuries. In NHPs, vaccination of either 25 g or 50 g ZF2001 prevented infection with SARS-CoV-2 in lung, trachea and bronchi, with milder lung lesions. No evidence of disease enhancement is observed in both models. ZF2001 is being evaluated in the ongoing international multi-center Phase 3 trials (NCT04646590) and has been approved for emergency use in Uzbekistan.",

Despite recent advances in GLP-1R structure elucidation, detailed mechanistic understanding of how different peptides generate profound differences in G protein-mediated signalling is still lacking. Here we have combined cryo-electron microscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, receptor mutagenesis and pharmacological assays, to interrogate the mechanism and consequences of GLP-1R binding by four peptide agonists; glucagon-like peptide-1, oxyntomodulin, exendin-4 and exendin-P5. These data revealed that distinctions in peptide N-terminal interactions and dynamics with the GLP-1R transmembrane domain are reciprocally associated with differences in the allosteric coupling to G proteins. In particular, transient interactions with residues at the base of the binding cavity correlate with enhanced kinetics for G protein activation, providing a rationale for differences in G protein-mediated signalling efficacy from distinct agonists.",

    "abstract": "Temporal control of inflammation is critical to avoid pathological developments, and is largely defined through the differential stabilities of mRNAs. While TTP-directed mRNA deadenylation is known to destabilize ARE-containing mRNAs, this mechanism alone cannot explain the variety of mRNA expression kinetics observed during inflammation resolution. Here we show that inflammation resolution requires CPEB4 expression, in vitro and in vivo. Our results identify that CPEB4-directed polyadenylation and TTP-mediated deadenylation compete during the resolutive phase of the LPS response to uncouple the degradation of pro-inflammatory mRNAs from the sustained expression of anti-inflammatory mRNAs. The outcome of this equilibrium is quantitatively defined by the relative number of CPEs and AREs in each mRNA, and further shaped by the coordinated regulation by the MAPK signalling pathway of the levels and activities of their trans-acting factors, CPEB4 and TTP. Altogether, we describe a temporal- and transcript-specific regulatory network controlling the extent of the inflammatory response.",
