    "abstract": "The auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) has been proposed as a biomarker of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction in schizophrenia. Pathophysiological theories suggest that such dysfunction might be partially caused by aberrant interactions of different modulatory neurotransmitters with NMDARs, which could explain heterogeneity among patients with schizophrenia and their treatment response. Understanding the differential impact of different neuromodulators on readouts of NMDAR function is therefore of high clinical relevance.\n\nHere, we report results from two studies (N=81 each) which systematically tested whether the MMN is sensitive to diminishing and enhancing cholinergic vs. dopaminergic function. Both studies used a double-blind, placebo-controlled between-subject design and monitored individual drug plasma levels. Using a novel variant of the auditory oddball paradigm, we contrasted phases with stable versus volatile probabilities of tone switches. In the first study, we found that the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist biperiden reduced and/or delayed mismatch responses, particularly during stable phases of the experiment, whereas this effect was absent for amisulpride, a dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist. The direct comparison between biperiden and amisulpride indicated a significant drug x mismatch interaction. In the second study, neither elevating acetylcholine nor dopamine levels via administration of galantamine and levodopa, respectively, exerted significant effects on MMN.\n\nOverall, our results indicate differential sensitivity of the MMN to changes in cholinergic (muscarinic) versus dopaminergic receptor function. This finding may prove useful for developments of future tools for predicting individual treatment responses in disorders that show abnormal MMN, such as schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Understanding hierarchy and modularity in natural as well as technological networks is of utmost importance. A major aspect of such analysis involves identifying the nodes that are crucial to the overall processing structure of the network. More recently, the approach of hourglass analysis has been developed for the purpose of quantitatively analyzing whether only a few intermediate nodes mediate the information processing between a large number of inputs and outputs of a network. We develop a new framework for hourglass analysis that takes network weights into account while identifying the core nodes and the extent of hourglass effect in a given weighted network. We use this framework to study the structural connectome of the C. elegans and identify intermediate neurons that form the core of sensori-motor pathways in the organism. Our results show that the neurons forming the core of the connectome show significant differences across the male and hermaphrodite sexes, with most core nodes in the male concentrated in sex-organs while they are located in the head for the hermaphrodite. Our work demonstrates that taking weights into account for network analysis framework leads to emergence of different network patterns in terms of identification of core nodes and hourglass structure in the network, which otherwise would be missed by unweighted approaches.",

    "abstract": "A few studies have compared the static functional connectivity between awake and anaesthetized states in rodents by resting-state fMRI. However, impact of anaesthesia on static and dynamic fluctuations in functional connectivity has not been fully understood. Here, we developed a resting-state fMRI protocol to perform awake and anaesthetized functional MRI in the same mice. Static functional connectivity showed a widespread decrease under anaesthesia, such as when under isoflurane or a mixture of isoflurane and medetomidine. Several interhemispheric connections were key connections for anaesthetized condition from awake. Dynamic functional connectivity demonstrates the shift from frequent broad connections across the cortex, the hypothalamus, and the auditory-visual cortex to frequent local connections within the cortex only. Fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation in the thalamic nuclei decreased under both anaesthesia. These results indicate that typical anaesthetics for functional MRI alters the spatiotemporal profile of the dynamic brain network in subcortical regions, including the thalamic nuclei and limbic system.\n\nHighlightsO_LIResting-state fMRI was compared between awake and anaesthetized in the same mice.\nC_LIO_LIAnaesthesia induced a widespread decrease of static functional connectivity.\nC_LIO_LIAnaesthesia strengthened local connections within the cortex.\nC_LIO_LIfALFF in the thalamus was decreased by anaesthesia.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Tissue microenvironment properties like blood flow, extracellular matrix or proximity to immune infiltrate are important regulators of cell biology. However, methods to study regional protein expression in context of the native tissue environment are limited. To address this need we have developed a novel approach to visualize, purify and measure proteins in situ using Automated Spatially Targeted Optical Micro Proteomics (AutoSTOMP) 2.0. We previously implemented AutoSTOMP to identify proteins localized to the vacuoles of obligate intracellular microbes at the 1-2 m scale within infected host cells1. Here we report custom codes in SikuliX to specify regions of heterogeneity in a tissue section and then biotin tag and identify proteins belonging to specific cell types or structures within those regions. To enrich biotinylated targets from fixed tissue samples we developed a biochemical protocol compatible with LC-MS. These tools were applied to a) identify inflammatory proteins expressed by CD68+ macrophages in rat cardiac infarcts and b) characterize inflammatory proteins enriched in IgG4+ lesions in esophageal tissue. These data indicate that AutoSTOMP is a flexible approach to determine regional protein expression in situ on a range of primary tissues and clinical biopsies where current tools are limited.",

    "abstract": "The thymus is the site of both {beta} and {gamma}{delta}-T cell development. After several unique waves of {gamma}{delta}-T cells are generated in, and exported from, the fetal/neonatal thymus, the adult thymus continues to produce a stream of {gamma}{delta}-T cells throughout life. One intriguing feature of {gamma}{delta} T cell development is the coordination of differentiation and acquisition of effector function within the fetal thymus, however, it is less clear whether this paradigm holds true in adult animals. To investigate the relationship between maturation and time since V(D)J recombination in adult-derived {gamma}{delta}-thymocytes, we used the Rag2pGFP model. Immature (CD24+) {gamma}{delta}-thymocytes expressed high levels of GFP while only a small minority of mature (CD24-) {gamma}{delta}-thymocytes were GFP+. Similarly, most GFP+ {gamma}{delta}-splenocytes were immature, while some were mature. Analysis of {gamma}{delta}-recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) indicated that most {gamma}{delta}-T cell RTEs were CD24+ and GFP+ and adoptive transfer experiments showed that immature {gamma}{delta}-thymocytes could be maintained in the periphery for at least 3 days over which time they matured. With respect to the mature {gamma}{delta}-thymocytes that were GFP-, parabiosis experiments demonstrated that mature {gamma}{delta}-T cells did not recirculate from the periphery. Instead, a population of mature {gamma}{delta}-thymocytes remained resident in the thymus for at least 60 days while mature {gamma}{delta}-thymocytes derived solely from adult hematopoiesis were mostly lost from the thymus within 60 days. Collectively, these data demonstrate two streams of actively developing {gamma}{delta}-T cells in adult mice: an immature subset that quickly leaves the thymus and matures in the periphery, and one that completes maturation within the thymus over a longer period of time. Furthermore, there is a fetal-derived and heterogeneous population of resident {gamma}{delta}-thymocytes of unknown functional importance.",

    "abstract": "Marimo (lake ball) is an uncommon ball-like aggregation of the green alga, Aegagropila linnaei. Although A. linnaei is broadly distributed in fresh and brackish waters in the northern hemisphere, marimo colonies are found only in particular habitats. The colonies have been gradually shrinking in recent years. Nevertheless, it is not clear how and why A. linnaei forms such massive spherical aggregations. Here, we report the bacterial microbiomes inside various sizes and aggregating structures of natural marimo collected from Lake Akan, Japan. We observed multi-layers composed of sediment particles only in the sizeable radial-type marimo with a >20 cm diameter, not in the tangled-type marimo. The deeper layers were enriched by Nitrospira, potential novel sulphur-oxidizing bacteria, and sulphate-reducing Desulfobacteraceae bacteria. The sulphur cycle-related bacteria are unique to Lake Akan due to sulphur deposits from the nearby volcanic mountains. Some of them were also recovered from lake sediments. Microorganisms of the multi-layers would form biofilms incorporating nearby sediment, which would function as microbial \"seals\" within large radial-type marimo. We propose that the layer structure provides habitats for diverse bacterial communities, promotes airtightness of the marimo, and finally contributes to the massive growth of the aggregation. These findings provide a clue to deciphering the massive growth of endangered marimo aggregates.",

    "abstract": "In agricultural landscapes, the amount and organization of crops and semi-natural habitats (SNH) have the potential to promote a bundle of ecosystem services due to their influence on ecological community at multiple spatio-temporal scales. SNH are relatively undisturbed and are often source of complementary resources and refuges, supporting more diverse and abundant natural pest enemies. However, the nexus of SNH proportion and organization with pest suppression is not trivial. It is thus crucial to understand how the behavior of pest and auxiliary species, the underlying landscape structure, and their interaction may influence conservation biological control (CBC). Here, we develop a generative stochastic landscape model to simulate realistic agricultural landscape compositions and configurations of fields and linear elements. Generated landscapes are used as spatial support over which we simulate a spatially explicit predator-prey dynamic model. We find that SNH boost predator population, but predator movement from hedges to fields is fundamental for an efficient pest regulation by auxiliaries and to decrease pesticide treatments. Moreover landscape elements may lead to different effects on pest reduction depending on the considered scale. Integration of species behaviors and traits with landscape structure at multiple scales are needed to provide useful insights for CBC.",

    "abstract": "Predators largely affect ecosystems through trophic interactions, but they also can have indirect effects by altering nutrient dynamics and acting as ecosystem engineers. Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) are ecosystem engineers that concentrate nutrients on their dens, creating biogeochemical hotspots with lush vegetation on the nutrient-limited tundra. Red foxes (V. vulpes) similarly engineer subarctic environments through their denning behavior, and have recently expanded onto the tundra where they now often occupy historical Arctic fox dens. We evaluated the impact of fox denning activity on the spatial behavior of other tundra wildlife by comparing predator and herbivore visits to 12 natal dens and adjacent control sites over two years using camera traps in northeastern Manitoba, where both fox species are sympatric. Both the capture rates and species richness of wildlife were significantly greater at fox dens relative to control sites. Predators were detected almost exclusively on dens occupied by foxes, where they were observed investigating and scavenging prey remains (carrion, feathers), suggesting carcass presence or fox presence attracts predators to den sites. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) also visited dens more often than control sites, likely attracted by the enhanced vegetation typically found on dens. Our results suggest fox ecosystem engineering affects the spatial distribution of herbivores by enriching vegetation at dens, and other predators by providing carrion. Understanding how predators affect other organisms via non-trophic interactions provides an enriched view of their functional roles within ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The nucleoskeleton forms a filamentous meshwork under the nuclear envelope and contributes to the regulation of nuclear morphology and gene expression. To understand how the Arabidopsis nucleoskeleton physically connects to the nuclear periphery, we investigated the nucleoskeleton protein KAKU4 and sought for functional regions responsible for its localization at the nuclear periphery. Computational predictions identified three evolutionary conserved peptide motifs within the N-terminal region of KAKU4. Functional analysis revealed that these motifs are required for homomerization of KAKU4, interaction with the nucleoskeleton proteins CROWDED NUCLEI (CRWN) and localization at the nuclear periphery. We find that similar protein motifs are present in NUP82 and NUP136, two plant specific nucleoporins from the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) basket. These conserved motifs allow the two nucleoporins to bind CRWN proteins, thus revealing a physical link between the nucleoskeleton and nuclear pores in plants. Finally, whilst NUP82, NUP136 and KAKU4 have a common evolutionary history predating non-vascular land plants, KAKU4 mainly localizes outside the NPC suggesting neofunctionalization of an ancient nucleoporin into a new nucleoskeleton component.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by recognising and binding specific DNA sequences. At times, these regulatory elements may be occluded by nucleosomes, making them inaccessible for TF-binding. The competition for DNA occupancy between TFs and nucleosomes, and associated gene regulatory outputs, are important consequences of the cis-regulatory information encoded in the genome. However, these sequence patterns are subtle and remain difficult to interpret. Here, we introduce ChromWave, a deep-learning model that, for the first time, predicts the competing profiles for TF and nucleosomes occupancies with remarkable accuracy. Models trained using short- and long-fragment MNase-Seq data successfully learn the sequence preferences underlying TF and nucleosome occupancies across the entire yeast genome. They recapitulate nucleosome evictions from regions containing \"strong\" TF binding sites and knock-out simulations show nucleosomes gaining occupancy in the absence of these TFs, accompanied by lateral rearrangement of adjacent nucleosomes. At a local level, models anticipate with high accuracy the outcomes of detailed experimental analysis of partially unwrapped nucleosomes at the GAL4 UAS locus. Finally, we trained a ChromWave model that successfully predicts nucleosome positions at promoters in the human genome. We find that human promoters generally contain few sites at which simple sequence changes can alter nucleosome occupancies and that these positions align well with causal variants linked to DNase hypersensitivity.",
