    "abstract": "High blood pressure is one of the major public health problems which causes severe disorders in several tissues including the human kidney. One of the most important signaling pathways associated with the regulation of blood pressure is the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), with its main mediator angiotensin II (ANGII). Elevated levels of circulating and intracellular ANGII and aldosterone lead to pro-fibrotic, -inflammatory and -hypertrophic milieu that causes remodelling and dysfunction in cardiovascular and renal tissues. Furthermore, ANGII has been recognized as major risk factor for the induction of apoptosis in podocytes, ultimately leading to chronic kidney disease (CDK).\n\nIn the past, disease modeling of kidney-associated malignancies was extremely difficult, as the derivation of kidney originated cells is very challenging. Here we describe a differentiation protocol for reproducible differentiation of SIX2-positive urine derived renal progenitor cells (UdRPCs) into mature podocytes bearing typical foot processes. The UdRPCs-derived podocytes show the ability to execute Albumin endocytosis and the activation of the renin-angiotensin system by being responsive to ANGII stimulation. Our data reveals the ANGII dependent downregulation of NPHS1 and SYNPO, resulting in the disruption of the complex podocyte cytoskeletal architecture, as shown by immunofluorescence-based detection of -ACTININ. In the present manuscript we confirm and propose UdRPCs as a unique cell type useful for studying nephrogenesis and associated diseases. Furthermore, the responsiveness of UdRPCs-derived podocytes to ANGII implies potential applications in nephrotoxicity studies and drug screening.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMalaria parasites are very vulnerable to oxidative stress during the part of their life cycle when they inhabit the erythrocytes. Studies have shown that dietary intake of antioxidant plays a role in stabilizing oxidative stress.\n\nMethodsThe objective of this research work was to examine the antioxidative effect of red palm oil on Plasmodium berghei malaria induced oxidative stress. Sixty (60) mice were distributed into five groups. Group A served as the negative control (healthy mice with normal feed); group B as positive control (healthy mice fed with red palm oil without malaria parasite.while the other groups (C to E) served as the test groups. Group C served as group of healthy mice fed with red palm oil (pelletized), infected with malaria parasite without antimalaria drug. Group D served as group of healthy mice fed with red palm oil (pelletized), infected with malaria parasite and treated with amodiaquine. Group E served as group of healthy mice fed with normal feed, infected with malaria parasite and treated with amodiaquine. The parasitemia levels were estimated on days 1,4 and 5. The activity of oxidative stress enzymes biomarkers were determined spectrophotometrically.\n\nResultGroup A showed a statistically significant increase in the activity of SOD (1.90 {+/-} 0.16 units/mg protein), GST (1.68 {+/-} 0.086 units/L) compared to group C, SOD (3.54 {+/-} 0.83 units/mg protein), GST (2.12 {+/-} 0.20 units/L). Group B showed a statistical significant decrease in the activities of SOD (3.22 {+/-} 0.33 units/mg protein), Catalase (49.11 {+/-} 2.35 {micro}mol/min), GSH-R (31.50 {+/-} 2.48 units/L) compared to group E, SOD (2.18 {+/-} 0.39 units/mg protein), Catalase (44.07 {+/-} 3.88 {micro}mol/min), GSH-R (27.75 {+/-} 1.64 units/L).\n\nConclusionThe dietary intake of red palm oil helps to reduce free radical mediated injury to the tissue thus preventing oxidative stress induced by malaria or any other factors.",

    "abstract": "Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor (VIP1R) is a class B G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system, T-lymphocytes, and peripheral tissues of organs like lungs and liver. Critical functions of these receptors render them potential pharmacological targets for the treatment of a broad spectrum of inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we use atomistic studies to show that phospholipids can act as potent regulators of peptide binding on to the receptor. We simulated the binding of neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP27) into the transmembrane bundle of the receptor. The simulations reveal two lipid binding sites on the peptidic ligand for the negatively charged phosphodiester of phospholipids in the extracellular leaflet which lower the peptide-receptor binding free energy by ~8kBT. We further simulated the effect of anionic lipids phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). These lipids show much stronger interaction, lowering the peptide-receptor binding energy by an additional ~7kBT compared to POPC lipids. These findings suggest that lipids can play an active role in catalyzing peptide-receptor binding and activating vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptors.",

    "abstract": "Outer membrane TonB-dependent transporters facilitate the uptake of trace nutrients and carbohydrates in Gram negative bacteria and are essential for pathogenic bacteria and the health of the microbiome. Despite this, their mechanism of transport is still unknown. Here, pulse EPR measurements were made in intact cells on the Escherichia coli vitamin B12 transporter, BtuB. Substrate binding was found to alter the C-terminal region of the core and shift an extracellular substrate binding loop 2 nm towards the periplasm; moreover, this structural transition is regulated by an ionic lock that is broken upon binding of the inner membrane protein TonB. Significantly, this structural transition is not observed when BtuB is reconstituted into phospholipid bilayers. These measurements suggest an alternative to existing models of transport, where TonB binding alone is sufficient to produce allosteric rearrangements in the transporter. They also demonstrate the importance of studying outer membrane proteins in their native environment.",

    "abstract": "Kinase activating mutation in FLT3 is the most frequent genetic lesion associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Therapeutic response to FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is dismal, and many patients relapse even after allogenic stem cell transplantation. Despite the introduction of more selective FLT3 inhibitors, remissions are short-lived, and patients show progressive disease after an initial response. Acquisition of resistance-conferring genetic mutations and growth factor signaling are two principal mechanisms that drive relapse. FLT3 inhibitors targeting both escape mechanisms could lead to a more profound and lasting clinical responses. Here we show that the JAK2 inhibitor, momelotinib, is an equipotent type-1 FLT3 inhibitor. Momelotinib showed potent inhibitory activity on both mouse and human cells expressing FLT3-ITD, including clinically relevant resistant mutations within the activation loop at residues, D835, D839, and Y842. Additionally, momelotinib efficiently suppressed the resistance mediated by FLT3 ligand (FL) and hematopoietic cytokine activated JAK2 signaling. Interestingly, unlike gilteritinib, momelotinib inhibits the expression of MYC in leukemic cells. Consequently, concomitant inhibition of FLT3 and downregulation of MYC by momelotinib treatment showed better efficacy in suppressing the leukemia in a preclinical murine model of AML. Altogether, these data provide evidence that momelotinib is an effective type-1 dual JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor and may offer an alternative to gilteritinib. Its ability to impede the resistance conferred by growth factor signaling and activation loop mutants suggests that momelotinib treatment could provide a deeper and durable response; thus, warrants its clinical evaluation.\n\nKey pointsO_LIMomelotinib shows high efficacy against FLT3 mutated AML cells including quizartinib-resistant activation loop variants.\nC_LIO_LIMomelotinib effectively suppresses intrinsic resistance conferred by FLT3 ligand and hematopoietic cytokines (GM-CSF and IL3).\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with ALK-rearranged tumors, treatment with ALK inhibitors can improve outcomes. However, clinical resistance typically develops over time, and in the majority of cases resistance mechanisms are ALK-independent. We generated tumor cell cultures from multiple regions of an ALK-rearranged clinical tumor specimen, and deployed functional drug screens to identify modulators of resistance to ALK inhibitors. This identified a role for PI3K{beta} and EGFR in regulating resistance to ALK inhibition. Furthermore, inhibition of ALK elicited activation of EGFR, and inhibition of PI3K{beta} rescued EGFR-mediated ALK inhibitor resistance. In ALK-rearranged primary cultures, cell lines and in vivo xenograft models, combined inhibition of ALK and PI3K{beta} prevented compensatory MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathway reactivation and selectively targeted the cancer cells. The combinatorial effect was seen even in the background of TP53 mutations and in epithelial-mesenchymal transformed cells. In conclusion, combinatorial ALK and PI3K{beta} inhibitor treatment carries promise as a treatment for ALK-rearranged NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing need to develop novel therapeutics for targeted treatment of cancer. The prerequisite to success is the knowledge about which types of molecular alterations are predominantly driving tumorigenesis. To shed light onto this subject, we have utilized the largest database of human cancer mutations - TCGA PanCanAtlas, multiple established algorithms for cancer driver prediction (2020plus, CHASMplus, CompositeDriver, dNdScv, DriverNet, HotMAPS, OncodriveCLUSTL, OncodriveFML) and developed four novel computational pipelines: SNADRIF (Single Nucleotide Alteration DRIver Finder), GECNAV (Gene Expression-based Copy Number Alteration Validator), ANDRIF (ANeuploidy DRIver Finder) and PALDRIC (PAtient-Level DRIver Classifier). A unified workflow integrating all these pipelines, algorithms and datasets at cohort and patient levels was created.\n\nWe have found that there are on average 12 driver events per tumour, of which 0.6 are single nucleotide alterations (SNAs) in oncogenes, 1.5 are amplifications of oncogenes, 1.2 are SNAs in tumour suppressors, 2.1 are deletions of tumour suppressors, 1.5 are driver chromosome losses, 1 is a driver chromosome gain, 2 are driver chromosome arm losses, and 1.5 are driver chromosome arm gains. The average number of driver events per tumour increases with age (from 7 to 15) and cancer stage (from 10 to 15) and varies strongly between cancer types (from 1 to 24). Patients with 1 and 7 driver events per tumour are the most frequent, and there are very few patients with more than 40 events. In tumours having only one driver event, this event is most often an SNA in an oncogene. However, with increasing number of driver events per tumour, the contribution of SNAs decreases, whereas the contribution of copy-number alterations and aneuploidy events increases.\n\nAuthor SummaryBy analysing genomic and transcriptomic data from 10000 cancer patients through our custom-built computational pipelines and previously established third-party algorithms, we have found that half of all driver events in a patients tumour appear to be gains and losses of chromosomal arms and whole chromosomes. We therefore suggest that future therapeutics development efforts should be focused on targeting aneuploidy. We have also found that approximately a third of driver events in a patient are whole gene amplifications and deletions. Thus, therapies aimed at copy-number alterations also appear very promising. On the other hand, drugs aiming at point mutations are predicted to be less successful, as these alterations are responsible for just a couple of drivers per tumour. One notable exception are patients having only one driver event in their tumours, as this event is almost always a single nucleotide alteration in an oncogene.",

    "abstract": "The E3 ligase RNF168 has been suggested to have roles at DNA replication forks in addition to its canonical functions in DNA double-strand break (DSB) signaling. However, the precise role of RNF168 in DNA replication remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that RNF168 is recruited to DNA replication factories independent of the canonical DSB response pathway regulators and identify a degenerate PCNA-Interacting Peptide (DPIP) motif in the C-terminus of RNF168 which mediates its binding to PCNA. An RNF168 mutant harboring substitutions in the DPIP box fails to interact with PCNA and is not recruited to sites of DNA synthesis, yet fully retains its ability to promote DSB-induced 53BP1 foci. Surprisingly, the RNF168 DPIP mutant also retains the ability to support ongoing DNA replication fork movement, demonstrating that PCNA-binding is dispensable for normal S-phase functions. However, replisome-associated RNF168 functions to suppress the DSB-induced 53BP1 DNA damage response during S-phase. Moreover, we show that WT RNF168 can perform PCNA ubiquitylation independently of RAD18 and also synergizes with RAD18 to amplify PCNA ubiquitylation. Taken together, our results identify non-canonical functions of RNF168 at the replication fork and demonstrate new mechanisms of cross talk between the DNA damage and replication stress response pathways.",

    "abstract": "Ongoing healthcare-associated outbreaks of multidrug-resistant yeast Candida auris have prompted development of several rapid DNA-based molecular diagnostic tests. These tests do not distinguish between live and dead C. auris cells, limiting their use for environmental surveillance and containment efforts. We addressed this critical gap by developing a reverse transcriptase (RT) real-time PCR assay for rapid detection of live C. auris in healthcare environments. The assay targets the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) cDNA of C. auris, amplified by obtaining pure RNA followed by reverse transcription and real-time PCR assay. The assay was highly sensitive, with the detection limit of ten colony-forming units (CFU) per RT real-time PCR reaction. In C. auris viability studies, ITS2 cDNA was detectable in heat- and ethanol-killed C. auris cells, but not bleach-killed cells. Validation studies showed no cycle threshold (Ct) values were obtained from samples on a sponge matrix spiked with either dead C. auris (105/ml) or other Candida species (105/ml), while most environmental samples spiked with 102 to 105 CFU of live C. auris yielded positive Ct values. Finally, 33 environmental samples positive for C. auris DNA but negative by culture were all negative by RT real-time PCR assay, confirming concordance between culture and the assay. The RT real-time PCR assay appears highly reproducible, robust, and specific for detecting live C. auris from environmental samples, and could be an invaluable tool in surveillance efforts to control the spread of live C. auris in healthcare environments.",

    "abstract": "Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive disease that is notoriously difficult to treat. Here, we used a BRAFV600E-driven mouse model to study melanoma progression and metastasis in the absence of extrinsic mutagenic factors such as UV radiation. The tumors were grown for different time periods in seven different mice such that disease progression was tracked over time. We sequenced the whole exome and whole transcriptome of 16 melanoma samples from these mice. The timed samples revealed that many genes are increasingly upregulated during progression, such as genes involved in extracellular matrix organization, and Vegfc, a factor that induces lymphatic vessel growth and metastases to lymph nodes, which was identified as an important signaling hub in our analysis. The Vegfc gene interaction network highlighted multiple genes from the MAPK pathway that are increasingly deregulated during tumor evolution. The genomic diversity of primary and metastatic tumors showed an increase over time. Additionally, our integrative multi-omics analysis adds further evidence that Rock1 is a crucial player driving metastasis formation, and may be upregulated due to mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway. In summary, our study contributes towards an improved understanding of melanoma which may eventually lead to improved treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most common and aggressive type of ovarian cancer. Platinum resistance is a common occurrence in HGSOC and a main cause of tumor relapse resulting in high patient mortality rates. Recurrent OC is enriched in aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)+ ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs), which are resistant to platinum agents. We demonstrated that acute platinum treatment induced a DNA damage-dependent decrease in BRCA1 levels. In a parallel response associated with G2/M arrest, platinum treatment also induced an increase in expression of NAMPT, the rate limiting regulator of NAD+ production from the salvage pathway, and levels of NAD+, the cofactor required for ALDH activity. Concurrent inhibition of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and NAMPT synergistically abrogated the platinum-induced increase in OCSCs. Combining pharmacological inhibitors of DNMT and NAMPT with carboplatin reduced tumorigenesis and OCSC percentage in vivo.

    "abstract": "Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an aggressive form of primary breast cancer characterized by rapid onset and high risk of metastasis and poor clinical outcomes. The biological basis for the aggressiveness of IBC is still not well understood and no IBC-specific targeted therapies exist. In this study we report that lipocalin 2 (LCN2), a small secreted glycoprotein belonging to the lipocalin superfamily, is expressed at significantly higher levels in IBC versus non-IBC tumors, independently of molecular subtype. LCN2 levels were also significantly higher in IBC cell lines and in their culture media than in non-IBC cell lines. High expression was associated with poor-prognosis features and shorter overall survival in IBC patients. Depletion of LCN2 in IBC cell lines reduced proliferation, colony formation, migration, and cancer stem cell populations in vitro, and inhibited tumor growth, skin invasion, and brain metastasis in mouse models of IBC. Analysis of our proteomics data showed reduced expression of proteins involved in cell cycle and DNA repair in LCN2-silenced IBC cells. Our findings support that LCN2 promotes IBC tumor aggressiveness and offer a new potential therapeutic target for IBC.",

    "abstract": "The expanding knowledge of the variety of synthetic genetic elements has enabled the construction of new and more efficient genetic circuits and yielded novel insights into molecular mechanisms. However, context dependence, in which interactions between proximal (cis) or distal (trans) elements affect the behaviour of these elements, can reduce their general applicability or predictability. Genetic insulators, which mitigate unintended context-dependent cis-interactions, have been used to address this issue. One of the most commonly used genetic insulators is a self-splicing ribozyme called RiboJ, which can be used to decouple upstream 5 UTR in mRNA from downstream sequences (e.g., open reading frames). Despite its general use as an insulator, there has been no systematic study quantifying the efficiency of RiboJ splicing or whether this autocatalytic activity is robust to trans- and cis-genetic context. Here, we determine the robustness of RiboJ splicing in the genetic context of six widely divergent E. coli strains. We also check for possible cis-effects by assessing two SNP versions close to the catalytic site of RiboJ. We show that mRNA molecules containing RiboJ are rapidly spliced even during rapid exponential growth and high levels of gene expression, with a mean efficiency of 98%. We also show that neither the cis- nor trans-genetic context has a significant impact on RiboJ activity, suggesting this element is robust to both cis- and trans-genetic changes.",

Within each experimental group, some individuals experienced more severe disease than others but line 15I birds experienced milder disease based on average clinical scores, percentage of birds with gross pathology, average bursal lesion scores and average peak bursal virus titre. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that more severe disease in line W was associated with significant up-regulation of pathways involved in inflammation, cytoskeletal regulation by Rho GTPases, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling, and Wnt signaling in the bursa compared to line 15I. Primary bursal cell populations isolated from uninfected line W birds contained a significantly greater percentage of KUL01+ macrophages than cells isolated from line 15I birds (p<0.01) and, when stimulated ex vivo with LPS, showed more rapid up-regulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression than those from line 15I birds. We hypothesize that a more rapid induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in bursal cells following IBDV infection leads to more severe disease in line W birds than in line 15I.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans is the most common cause of death from fungal infections. Emergence of resistant strains reducing the efficacy of first line therapy with echinocandins such as caspofungin calls for the identification of alternative therapeutic strategies. Tra1 is an essential component of the SAGA and NuA4 transcriptional co-activator complexes. As a PIKK family member, Tra1 is characterized by a C-terminal phosphoinositide 3-kinase domain. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the assembly and function of SAGA and NuA4 is compromised by a version of Tra1 (Tra1Q3) with three arginine residues in the putative ATP-binding cleft changed to glutamine, Whole transcriptome analysis of the S. cerevisiae tra1Q3 strain highlights Tra1s role in global transcription, stress response and cell wall integrity. As a result, tra1Q3 increases susceptibility to multiple stressors, including caspofungin. Moreover, the same tra1Q3 allele in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans causes similar phenotypes, suggesting that Tra1 broadly mediates the antifungal response across yeast species. Transcriptional profiling in C. albicans identified 68 genes that were differentially expressed when the tra1Q3 strain was treated with caspofungin, as compared to gene expression changes induced by either tra1Q3 or caspofungin alone. Included in this set were genes involved in cell wall maintenance, adhesion and filamentous growth. Indeed, the tra1Q3 allele reduces filamentation and other pathogenesis traits in C. albicans. We identified EVP1, which encodes a putative plasma membrane protein, amongst the Tra1-regulated genes, Disrupting EVP1 results in reduced filamentation and infection capacity in C. albicans. Thus,Tra1 emerges as a promising therapeutic target for fungal infections.\n\nImportanceFungal pathogens such as Candida albicans are important agents of infectious disease, with increasing rates of drug resistance, and limited available antifungal therapeutics. In this study, we characterize the role of C. albicans Tra1, a critical component of acetyltransferase complexes, involved in transcriptional regulation and responses to environmental stress. We find C. albicans genetic mutants with impaired Tra1 function have reduced tolerance to cell-wall targeting stressors, including the clinically-important antifungal caspofungin. We further use RNA-sequencing to profile the global fungal response to the tra1 mutation, and identify a previously uncharacterized C. albicans gene, EVP1. We find that both TRA1 and EVP1 play an important role in phenotypes associated with fungal pathogenesis, including cellular morphogenesis, biofilm formation, and toxicity towards host immune cells. Together, this work describes the key role for Tra1 in regulating fungal drug tolerance and pathogenesis, and positions this protein as a promising therapeutic target for fungal infections.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity is important in that it can lower the overall cost of drug discovery in structure-based drug design. For more accurate prediction, many classical scoring functions and machine learning-based methods have been developed. However, these techniques tend to have limitations, mainly resulting from a lack of sufficient interactions energy terms to describe complex interactions between proteins and ligands. Recent deep-learning techniques show strong potential to solve this problem, but the search for more efficient and appropriate deep-learning architectures and methods to represent protein-ligand complexes continues. In this study, we proposed a deep-neural network for more accurate prediction of protein-ligand complex binding affinity. The proposed model has two important features, descriptor embeddings that contains embedded information about the local structures of a protein-ligand complex and an attention mechanism for highlighting important descriptors to binding affinity prediction. The proposed model showed better performance on most benchmark datasets than existing binding affinity prediction models. Moreover, we confirmed that an attention mechanism was able to capture binding sites in a protein-ligand complex and that it contributed to improvement in predictive performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Blue1993/BAPA.\n\nAuthor summaryThe initial step in drug discovery is to identify drug candidates for a target protein using a scoring function. Existing scoring functions, however, lack the ability to accurately predict the binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes. In this study, we proposed a deep learning-based approach to extract patterns from the local structures of protein-ligand complexes and to highlight the important local structures via an attention mechanism. The proposed model showed good performance for various benchmark datasets compared to existing models.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSingle-cell mass cytometry, also known as cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) is a powerful high-throughput technology that allows analysis of up to 50 protein markers per cell for the quantification and classification of single cells. Traditional manual gating utilized to identify new cell populations has been inadequate, inefficient, unreliable, and difficult to use, and no algorithms to identify both calibration and new cell populations has been well established.\n\nMethodsA deep learning with graphic cluster (DGCyTOF) visualization is developed as a new integrated embedding visualization approach in identifying canonical and new cell types. The DGCyTOF combines deep-learning classification and hierarchical stable-clustering methods to sequentially build a tri-layer construct for known cell types and the identification of new cell types. First, deep classification learning is constructed to distinguish calibration cell populations from all cells by softmax classification assignment under a probability threshold, and graph embedding clustering is then used to identify new cell populations sequentially. In the middle of two-layer, cell labels are automatically adjusted between new and unknown cell populations via a feedback loop using an iteration calibration system to reduce the rate of error in the identification of cell types, and a 3-dimensional (3D) visualization platform is finally developed to display the cell clusters with all cell-population types annotated.\n\nResultsUtilizing two benchmark CyTOF databases comprising up to 43 million cells, we compared accuracy and speed in the identification of cell types among DGCyTOF, DeepCyTOF, and other technologies including dimension reduction with clustering, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis (FA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Isometric Feature Mapping (Isomap), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with k-means clustering and Gaussian mixture clustering. We observed the DGCyTOF represents a robust complete learning system with high accuracy, speed and visualization by eight measurement criteria. The DGCyTOF displayed F-scores of 0.9921 for CyTOF1 and 0.9992 for CyTOF2 datasets, whereas those scores were only 0.507 and 0.529 for the t-SNE+k-means; 0.565 and 0.59, for UMAP+ k-means. Comparison of DGCyTOF with t-SNE and UMAP visualization in accuracy demonstrated its approximately 35% superiority in predicting cell types. In addition, observation of cell-population distribution was more intuitive in the 3D visualization in DGCyTOF than t-SNE and UMAP visualization.\n\nConclusionsThe DGCyTOF model can automatically assign known labels to single cells with high accuracy using deep-learning classification assembling with traditional graph-clustering and dimension-reduction strategies. Guided by a calibration system, the model seeks optimal accuracy balance among calibration cell populations and unknown cell types, yielding a complete and robust learning system that is highly accurate in the identification of cell populations compared to results using other methods in the analysis of single-cell CyTOF data. Application of the DGCyTOF method to identify cell populations could be extended to the analysis of single-cell RNASeq data and other omics data.\n\nAvailability and implementationA Python package (Python 3) and analysis scripts for reproducing the results are available at https://lijcheng12.github.io/DGCyTOF/.\n\nDGCyTOF python package contactLijun.cheng@osu.edu.\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at journal **** online.\n\nKey pointsO_LIDGCyTOF has been developed for the automatic identification of known and new cell populations.\nC_LIO_LIOptimal dimension reduction that integrates graphic-clustering technology facilitates highly accurate identification of new cell populations.\nC_LIO_LIUse of a feedback-calibration system can enhance the homology of cell types for the identification of cell populations.\nC_LIO_LIThree-dimensional visualization technology allows vivid depiction of cell types to improve their classification.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The bacterial elongation factor RfaH promotes the expression of virulence factors by specifically binding to RNA polymerases (RNAP) stalled at a DNA signal known as ops. This behavior is unlike that of its paralog NusG, the major representative of the protein family to which RfaH belongs. Both proteins have an N-terminal domain (NTD) bearing an RNAP binding site, yet NusG C-terminal domain (CTD) is folded as a {beta}-barrel while RfaH CTD is forming an -hairpin blocking such site. Upon recognition of the ops exposed by RNAP, RfaH is activated via interdomain dissociation and complete CTD structural rearrangement into a {beta}-barrel structurally identical to NusG CTD.\n\nAlthough RfaH transformation has been extensively characterized computationally, most studies employ tertiary biases towards each native state, hampering the analysis of sequence-encoded interactions on fold-switching. Here, we used Associative Water-mediated Structure and Energy Model (AWSEM) molecular dynamics to characterize the transformation of RfaH, spotlighting the sequence-dependent effects of NTD on CTD fold stabilization. Umbrella sampling simulations guided by native contacts recapitulate the thermodynamic equilibrium experimentally observed for RfaH and its isolated CTD. Temperature refolding simulations of full-length RfaH show a high success towards -folded CTD, whereas the NTD interferes with {beta}CTD folding, becoming trapped in a {beta}-barrel intermediate. Meanwhile, NusG CTD refolding is unaffected by the presence of RfaH NTD, showing that these NTD-CTD interactions are encoded in RfaH sequence. Altogether, these results suggest that the NTD of RfaH favors the -folded RfaH by specifically orienting the CTD upon interdomain binding and also by favoring {beta}-barrel rupture into an intermediate from which fold-switching proceeds.",

In this study, 20 nm SiO2 nanoparticles were dispersed in serum-containing (SC) and serum-free (SF) media to compare 2D cell culture and 3D cell culture toxicity. The cells were subjected to a 3D cell culture method in which HepG2, a human-derived liver cancer cell line, was mixed on a scaffold. We found that nanoparticles induced toxicity in 2D cell culture, but toxicity was not observed in 3D cell culture similar to in vivo environment.

Magnetic resonance imaging in humans has shown that brain water content declines with age as a result of progressive myelination. The purpose of this study was to quantify changes in brain water content during rat development and aging. Brain water content was measured by standard techniques in 129 normal male Sprague-Dawley rats that ranged in age (weight) from 13 to 149 days (18 to 759 g). Overall, the results demonstrated a decrease from 85.59% to 76.56% water content with increasing age (weight). Nonlinear allometric functions relating brain water to age and weight were determined. These findings provide age-related context for prior rat studies of brain water, emphasize the importance of using similarly aged controls in studies of brain water, and indicate that age-related changes in brain water content are not specific to humans.",

This approach can benefit one individual, but be ineffective or even detrimental for another. Studying the efficacy of the large range of different parameters for different individuals is costly, time-consuming and requires a large sample size that makes such research impractical and hinders effective interventions. Here an active machine learning technique is presented across participants--personalized Bayesian optimization (pBO)--that searches available parameter combinations to optimize an intervention as a function of an individuals ability. This novel technique was utilized to identify transcranial alternating current stimulation frequency and current strength combinations most likely to improve arithmetic performance, based on a subjects baseline arithmetic abilities. The pBO was performed across all subjects tested, building a model of subject performance, capable of recommending parameters for future subjects based on their baseline arithmetic ability. pBO successfully searches, learns, and recommends parameters for an effective neurointervention as supported by behavioral, stimulation, and neural data. The application of pBO in human-based research opens up new avenues for personalized and more effective interventions, as well as discoveries of protocols for treatment and translation to other clinical and non-clinical domains.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous brain activity is characterized by bursts and avalanche-like dynamics, with scale-free features typical of critical behaviour. The stochastic version of the celebrated Wilson-Cowan model has been widely studied as a system of spiking neurons reproducing non-trivial features of the neural activity, from avalanche dynamics to oscillatory behaviours. However, to what extent such phenomena are related to the presence of a genuine critical point remains elusive. Here we address this central issue, providing analytical results in the linear approximation and extensive numerical analysis. In particular, we present results supporting the existence of a bona fide critical point, where a second-order-like phase transition occurs, characterized by scale-free avalanche dynamics, scaling with the system size and a diverging relaxation time-scale. Moreover, our study shows that the observed critical behaviour falls within the universality class of the mean-field branching process, where the exponents of the avalanche size and duration distributions are, respectively, -3/2 and -2. We also provide an accurate analysis of the system behaviour as a function of the total number of neurons, focusing on the time correlation functions of the firing rate in a wide range of the parameter space.\n\nAuthor summaryNetworks of spiking neurons are introduced to describe some features of the brain activity, which are characterized by burst events (avalanches) with power-law distributions of size and duration. The observation of this kind of noisy behaviour in a wide variety of real systems led to the hypothesis that neuronal networks work in the proximity of a critical point. This hypothesis is at the core of an intense debate. At variance with previous claims, here we show that a stochastic version of the Wilson-Cowan model presents a phenomenology in agreement with the existence of a bona fide critical point for a particular choice of the relative synaptic weight between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The system behaviour at this point shows all features typical of criticality, such as diverging timescales, scaling with the system size and scale-free distributions of avalanche sizes and durations, with exponents corresponding to the mean-field branching process. Our analysis unveils the critical nature of the observed behaviours.",

    "abstract": "The obligate intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis manipulates the host actin cytoskeleton to assemble actin-rich structures that drive pathogen entry. This actin remodeling event exhibits relatively rapid dynamics that, through quantitative live-cell imaging, was revealed to consist of three phases - a fast recruitment phase which abruptly transitions to a fast turnover phase before resolving into a slow turnover of actin that indicates the end of actin remodeling. Here, we investigate Chlamydia invasion in the context of actin dynamics. Efficient invasion is associated with robust actin remodeling kinetics that results from a collaborative functional interaction between two different classes of actin nucleators - formins, including formin 1 and the diaphanous-related formins mDia1 and mDia2, and the Arp2/3 complex. Recruitment of these nucleators requires the presence of the chlamydial type III effector TarP, which enables the respective nucleating activities of formin and Arp2/3 to collaboratively generate a robust actin network. A collaborative model is supported by the observation that co-inhibition of Fmm1 and Arp2/3 further reduced both actin dynamics and invasion efficiency than either treatment alone. Furthermore, inhibition of recruitment of Fmn1 and/or Arp2/3 by deleting TarP was sufficient to similarly attenuated actin kinetics and invasion efficiency, supporting a model wherein TarP is the major contributor to robust actin remodeling via its recruitment of the two classes of actin nucleators. At the population level, the kinetics of recruitment and turnover of actin and its nucleators were linked. However, a more detailed analysis of the data at the level of individual elementary bodies showed significant variation and a lack of correlation between the kinetics of recruitment and turnover, suggesting that accessory factors variably modify actin kinetics at individual entry sites. In summary, efficient chlamydial invasion requires a specific profile of actin dynamics which are coordinated by TarP-dependent recruitment of two classes of actin nucleators.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe obligate intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis relies upon manipulation of the host actin cytoskeleton to drive its entry into host cells, such that impairment of actin dynamics attenuates Chlamydia invasion. Collaboration between two classes of actin nucleators, formin and Arp2/3, are known to enhance actin recruitment and turnover; we found that recruitment of both proteins to the signaling complex established by the type III secreted effector, TarP, was important for pathogen internalization. Furthermore, Formin 1 and Arp2/3 are co-recruited to sites of entry, and pharmacological inhibition of either actin nucleator impaired recruitment of the other, indicating a functional cooperation between branched and filamentous actin nucleation within pathogen entry sites. Disruption of this cooperation negatively impacted both actin dynamics and Chlamydia internalization, indicating that TarP-dependent entry of Chlamydia into non-phagocytic cells operates through the recruitment and activation of Arp2/3 and Formin 1. Finally, kinetic analysis of actin recruitment and turnover revealed that these processes were independently regulated, in addition to implicating the presence of local factors that fine-tune actin dynamics and subsequent invasion.",

    "abstract": "Multiple infections of genetically distinct clones of the same Plasmodium species are common in many malaria endemic settings. Mean multiplicity of infection (MOI) and the proportion of polyclonal infections are often reported as surrogate marker of transmission intensity, yet the relationship with traditional measures such as parasite prevalence is not well understood. We have searched Pubmed for articles on P. falciparum and P. vivax multiplicity, and compared the proportion of polyclonal infections and mean MOI to population prevalence. The impact of the genotyping method, number of genotyping markers, method for diagnosis (microscopy/RDT vs. PCR), presence of clinical symptoms, age, geographic region, and year of sample collection on multiplicity indices were assessed. For P. falciparum, 153 studies met inclusion criteria, yielding 275 individual data points and 33526 genotyped individuals. The proportion of polyclonal infections ranged from 0-96%, and mean MOI from 1-6.1. For P. vivax, 54 studies met inclusion criteria, yielding 115 data points and 13325 genotyped individuals. The proportion of polyclonal infections ranged from 0-100%, and mean MOI from 1-3.8. For both species, the proportion of polyclonal infections ranged from very low to close to 100% at low prevalence, while at high prevalence it was always high. Each percentage point increase in prevalence resulted in a 0.34% increase in the proportion of polyclonal P. falciparum infections (P<0.001), and a 0.78% increase in the proportion of polyclonal P. vivax infections (P<0.001). In multivariable analysis, higher prevalence, typing multiple markers, diagnosis of infections by PCR, and sampling in Africa were found to result in a higher proportion of P. falciparum polyclonal infections. For P. vivax, prevalence, year of study, typing multiple markers, and geographic region were significant predictors. In conclusion, polyclonal infections are frequently present in all settings, but the association between multiplicity and prevalence is weak.",

    "abstract": "Nutritional immunity involves cellular and physiological responses to invading pathogens, such as limiting iron availability, increasing exposure to bactericidal copper, and manipulating zinc to restrict the growth of pathogens. Manipulation of zinc at the host-pathogen interface depends on both the pathogens identity and the nature of the host cell. Here we examine infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages from 129S6/SvEvTac mice by Salmonella Typhimurium. Unlike Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice, 129S6/SvEvTac mice possess a functional Slc11a1 (Nramp-1), a phagosomal transporter of divalent cations. We carried out global RNA sequencing upon treatment with live or heat-killed Salmonella at 2 Hrs and 18 Hrs post-infection and observed widespread changes in metal transport, metal-dependent, and metal homeostasis genes, suggesting significant remodeling of iron, copper, and zinc availability by host cells. Changes in host cell gene expression suggest infection increases cytosolic zinc while simultaneously limiting zinc within the phagosome. Using a genetically encoded sensor, we demonstrate that cytosolic labile zinc increases 36-fold 12 hrs post-infection. Further, manipulation of zinc in the media alters bacterial clearance and replication, with zinc depletion inhibiting both processes. Comparing our results to published data on infection of C57BL/6 macrophages revealed notable differences in metal regulation and the global immune response, with 129S6 macrophages transitioning from M1 to M2 polarization over the course of infection and showing signs of recovery. Our results reveal that functional Slc11a1 profoundly affects the transcriptional landscape upon infection. Further, our results indicate that manipulation of zinc at the host-pathogen interface is more nuanced than that of iron or copper. 129S6 macrophage leverage intricate means of manipulating zinc availability and distribution to limit the pathogens access to zinc while simultaneously ensuring sufficient zinc to support the immune response.\n\nAuthor summaryMetal ions play an important role in influencing how immune cells such as macrophages respond to infection by pathogens. Because metal ions are both essential to survival, as well toxic when present is excessive amounts, the host and the pathogen have evolved diverse strategies to regulate metal acquisition and availability. Here, we show that the metal transporter slc11a1 plays a critical role in defining the host response to Salmonella infection. Infection causes widespread changes in expression of metal regulatory genes to limit the pathogens access to iron, increase its exposure to copper, and remodel zinc to ensure increased zinc in the cytosol and limited zinc for the pathogen. Macrophages expressing functional slc11a1 have a different profile of metal regulation and vastly different outcomes compared to immune compromised macrophage, demonstrating significantly different nutritional immune responses in immune competent versus immune compromised macrophages.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic signals in animals serve to convey context-dependent information to receivers. Birds and mammals combine diverse sounds into complex sequences to communicate, but these sequences largely remain understudied in other taxa. Anuran vocalizations are a prominent feature of their life history, and function in defense of territories and to attract mates. However, despite the spectacular diversity of anurans in tropical regions of the world, vocal diversity and communication strategies remain relatively poorly studied. Specifically, studies of vocal sequences and context-dependent vocal patterns in frogs remain few. Here, we investigated the context-dependent vocal repertoire and the use of vocal sequences by two anuran species belonging to different lineages, both endemic to the hyper-diverse Western Ghats of India. By recording vocal sequences both when frogs were alone and in the presence of a territorial rival, we present evidence that both species modify their vocal repertoire according to context. Specifically, one species appends notes to generate more complex sequences, whereas the other shifts to different note types, resulting in different sequences for different contexts. Thus, despite differences in repertoire size, both frog species are capable of adjusting the temporal sequence of vocalizations to communicate in different contexts. This study highlights the need for further studies of insular frogs, to understand how diversification across these continental islands has influenced the evolution of vocal repertoires, vocal sequence patterns and communication systems.\n\nLay SummaryAnimals employ complex sequences of acoustic signals to communicate in diverse behavioral contexts. Here, we demonstrate that two frog species with different vocal repertoires both modify the sequence of note emissions in the presence of a territorial rival. These patterns demonstrate that anurans are capable of complex shifts in the patterns of their vocalization, to communicate different messages to different receivers. Our findings demonstrate the value of studying behavioral diversity in tropical regions.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between language and human thought is the subject of long-standing debate. One specific claim implicates language in feature-based categorization. According to this view, language resources facilitate object categorization based on a certain feature (e.g., color). Specifically, it is hypothesized that verbal labels help maintain focus on a relevant categorization criterion and reduce interference from irrelevant features. As a result, language impairment is expected to affect categorization of items grouped according to a single feature (low-dimensional categories, e.g.,  Things that are yellow), where many irrelevant features need to be inhibited, more than categorization of items that share many features (high-dimensional categories, e.g.,  Animals), where few irrelevant features need to be inhibited. In two behavioral studies with individuals with aphasia, we failed to find consistent support for the role of language in low-dimensional categorization. We also collected fMRI data from healthy adults and observed little activity in language-responsive brain regions during both low-dimensional and high-dimensional categorization. Combined, these results demonstrate that the language system is not implicated in object categorization. Our work adds to the growing evidence that, although language may assist in accessing task-relevant information (e.g., instructions), many cognitive tasks in adult brains proceed without recruiting the language system.",

    "abstract": "Precise and reliable spike times are thought to subserve multiple possible functions, including improving the accuracy of encoding stimuli or behaviours relative to other coding schemes. Indeed, repeating sequences of spikes with sub-millisecond precision exist in nature, such as the synfire chain of spikes in area HVC of the zebra-finch mating-song circuit. Here, we analyzed what impact precise and reliable spikes have on the encoding accuracy for both the zebra-finch and more generic neural circuits using computational modelling. Our results show that neural circuits can use precisely timed spikes to encode signals with a higher-order accuracy than a conventional rate code. Circuits with precisely timed and reliably emitted spikes increase their encoding accuracy linearly with network size, which is the hallmark signature of an efficient code. This qualitatively differs from circuits that employ a rate code which increase their encoding accuracy with the square-root of network size. However, this improved scaling is dependent on the spikes becoming more accurate and more reliable with larger networks. Finally, we discuss how to test this scaling relationship in the zebra mating song circuit using both neural data and song-spectrogram-based recordings while taking advantage of the natural fluctuation in HVC network size due to neurogenesis. The zebra-finch mating-song circuit may represent the most likely candidate system for the use of spike-timing-based, efficient coding strategies in nature.",

    "abstract": "The capsid (CA) lattice of the HIV-1 core plays a key role during infection. From the moment the core is released into the cytoplasm, it interacts with a range of cellular factors that, ultimately, direct the pre-integration complex to the integration site. For integration to occur, the CA lattice must disassemble. Early uncoating or a failure to do so has detrimental effects on virus infectivity, indicating that an optimal stability of the viral core is crucial for infection. Here, we introduced cysteine residues into HIV-1 CA in order to induce disulphide bond formation and engineer hyper-stable mutants that are slower or unable to uncoat, and then followed their replication. From a panel of mutants, we identified three with increased capsid stability in cells and found that, whilst the M68C/E212C mutant had a 5-fold reduction in reverse transcription, two mutants, A14C/E45C and E180C, were able to reverse transcribe to approximately WT levels. Moreover, these mutants only had a 5-fold reduction in 2-LTR circle production, suggesting that not only could reverse transcription complete in hyper-stable cores, but that the nascent viral cDNA could enter the nuclear compartment. Furthermore, we observed significant levels of A14C/E45C mutant capsid in nuclear and chromatin-associated fractions implying that the hyper-stable cores themselves entered the nucleus. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that although the A14C/E45C mutant capsid reached the nuclear pore with the same kinetics as wild type capsid, it was then retained at the pore in association with Nup153. Crucially, infection with the hyper-stable mutants did not promote CPSF6 re-localisation to nuclear speckles, despite the mutant capsids being competent for CPSF6 binding. These observations suggest that hyper-stable cores are not able to uncoat, or remodel, enough to pass through or dissociate from the nuclear pore and integrate successfully. This, is turn, highlights the importance of capsid lattice flexibility for nuclear entry. In conclusion, we hypothesise that during a productive infection, a capsid remodelling step takes place at the nuclear pore that releases the core complex from Nup153, and relays it to CPSF6, which then localises it to chromatin ready for integration.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe mature viral core of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) consists of a highly organised lattice formed by capsid molecules that encloses the viral RNA and viral enzymes. This lattice is crucial during the early stages of viral replication, as it has to break down - uncoat - at the right time and place in order for the viral DNA to integrate successfully. Lentiviruses, like HIV, can infect non-dividing cells and are able to access the host cell DNA by entering the nucleus through nuclear pores. Until recently, uncoating was thought to occur in the cytoplasm as the whole core was thought too large to pass through the nuclear pore. However, lately it has been suggested that uncoating might occur at the nuclear pore or even inside the nucleus and the site of uncoating is currently hotly debated. By investigating HIV mutants with an increased lattice stability, we have shown that lattice flexibility is crucial for nuclear entry. Provocatively, we observed hyper-stable mutant capsid in nuclear and chromatin-associated fractions suggesting that uncoating is not required for nuclear entry. Nonetheless, microscopy experiments suggested that these hyper-stable mutants were retained on the inner side of the nuclear pore, and were impaired for downstream events in the nucleus, leading to a severe infectivity defect. Therefore, we believe that an essential uncoating, or capsid lattice remodelling event normally takes place at the nuclear pore.",

We investigated multiple mouse models of human ciliopathies (including Tctn2, Cc2d2a and Tmem231 mutants) and discovered that each displays hypotelorism, a narrowing of the midface. As early in development as the end of gastrulation, Tctn2 mutants displayed reduced activation of the Hedgehog (HH) pathway in the prechordal plate, the head organizer. This prechordal plate defect preceded a reduction of HH pathway activation and Shh expression in the adjacent neurectoderm. Concomitant with the reduction of HH pathway activity, Tctn2 mutants exhibited increased cell death in the neurectoderm and facial ectoderm, culminating in a collapse of the facial midline. Enhancing HH signaling by decreasing the gene dosage of a negative regulator of the pathway, Ptch1, decreased cell death and rescued the midface defect in both Tctn2 and Cc2d2a mutants. These results reveal that ciliary HH signaling mediates communication between the prechordal plate and the neurectoderm to provide cellular survival cues essential for development of the facial midline.",
