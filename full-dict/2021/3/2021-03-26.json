    "abstract": "We explore the energetic frustration patterns associated with the binding between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the ACE2 receptor protein in a broad selection of animals. Using energy landscape theory and the concept of energy frustration--theoretical tools originally developed to study protein folding--we are able to identify interactions among residues of the spike protein and ACE2 that result in COVID-19 resistance. This allows us to identify whether or not a particular animal is susceptible to COVID-19 from the protein sequence of ACE2 alone. Our analysis predicts a number of experimental observations regarding COVID-19 susceptibility, demonstrating that this feature can be explained, at least partially, on the basis of theoretical means.",

    "abstract": "The majority of arthropod species carry facultative heritable microbes, bacteria that are passed from mother to offspring, and which may contribute to host function. These symbionts are coinherited down the maternal line with mitochondria, and selection favouring either new symbionts, or new symbiont variants, is known to drive loss of mitochondrial diversity as a correlated response. More recently, evidence has accumulated of episodic directional selection on mitochondria. We therefore examined the reciprocal interaction and model the impact of selection on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) on symbiont frequency. We performed this for three generic scenarios: a fixed benefit to the host carrying the symbiont, a benefit that decreased with symbiont frequency, and a benefit that increased with symbiont frequency. We find that direct selection on mtDNA can drive symbionts out of the population under some circumstances. Symbiont extinction occurs where the positively selected mtDNA mutation occurs initially in an individual that is uninfected with the symbiont, and the symbiont is initially at low frequency. When, in contrast, the positively selected mtDNA mutation occurs in a symbiont infected individual, the mutation becomes fixed and in doing so removes symbiont variation from the population. Given low frequency symbiont infections are common in natural populations, and selection on mtDNA is also considered to occur frequently, we conclude that mtDNA driven loss of symbionts represents a novel mechanism driving loss of facultative heritable microbes. We conclude further that the molecular evolution of symbionts and mitochondria, which has previously been viewed from a perspective of selection on symbionts driving the evolution of a neutral mtDNA marker, should be reappraised in the light of positive selection on mtDNA. Where low mtDNA and symbiont genetic diversity are observed, it should not be assumed to be a consequences of selection acting on the symbiont.",

    "abstract": "The brain presents a real complex network of modular, small-world, and hierarchical nature, which are features of non-Euclidean geometry. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), we constructed a scale-free binary graph for each subject, using internodal time-series correlation of regions-of-interest (ROIs) as a proximity measure. The resulted network could be embedded onto manifolds of various curvature and dimensions. While maintaining the fidelity of embedding (low distortion, high mean average precision), functional brain networks were found to be best represented in the hyperbolic disc. Using [Formula] model, we reduced the dimension of the network into 2-D hyperbolic space and were able to efficiently visualize the internodal connections of the brain, preserving proximity as distances and angles on the hyperbolic discs. Each individual disc revealed decentralized nature of information flow and anatomic relevance. Using the hyperbolic distance on the [Formula] model, we could detect the anomaly of network in autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) subjects. This procedure of embedding grants us a reliable new framework for studying functional brain networks and the possibility of detecting anomalies of the network in the hyperbolic disc on an individual scale.",

    "abstract": "The combination of cross-linking/mass spectrometry (XL-MS) and ion mobility is still underexplored for conducting protein conformational and protein-protein interaction studies. We present a method for analyzing cross-linking mixtures on a timsTOF Pro mass spectrometer that allows separating ions based on their gas phase mobilities. Cross-linking was performed with three urea-based MS-cleavable cross-linkers that deliver distinct fragmentation patterns for cross-linked species upon collisional activation. The discrimination of cross-linked species from non-cross-linked peptides was readily performed based on their collisional cross sections. We demonstrate the general feasibility of our combined XL-MS/ion mobility approach for three protein systems of increasing complexity: (i) Bovine serum albumin, (ii) E. coli ribosome, and (iii) HEK293T cell nuclear lysates. We identified a total of 508 unique cross-linking sites for BSA, 868 for the E. coli ribosome, and 1,623 unique cross-links for nuclear lysates, corresponding to 1,088 intra- and 535 interprotein interactions and yielding 564 distinct protein-protein interactions. Our results underline the strength of combining XL-MS with ion mobility not only for deriving 3D-structures of single proteins, but also for performing system-wide protein interaction studies.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=105 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/437136v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@141c418org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b13483org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eeb0ecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a15c12_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are central pathways of metabolism across all domains of life. A prominent enzyme in these pathways is phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) which mediates the interconversion of glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The predatory bacterium Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus leads a complex lifecycle, switching between intraperiplasmic replicative and extracellular \"hunter\" attack-phase stages. Passage through this complex lifecycle involves different metabolic states. Here we present the unliganded and substrate bound structures of the Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus PGI, solved to 1.74[A] and 1.67 [A], respectively. These structures reveal that an induced-fit conformational change within the active site is not a pre-requisite for the binding of substrates in some PGIs. Crucially, we suggest a phenylalanine residue, conserved across most PGI enzymes but substituted for a glycine in Bdellovibrio and other select organisms, is central to the induced-fit mode of substrate recognition for PGIs. This enzyme also represents the smallest conventional PGI characterised to date and likely represents the minimal requirements for a functional PGI.",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposeP2X receptors (P2XRs) are trimeric ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) that open a cation-selective pore in response to ATP binding to their large extracellular domain (ECD). The seven known P2XR subtypes can assemble as homo- or heterotrimeric complexes and contribute to numerous physiological functions, including nociception, inflammation and hearing. The overall structure of P2XRs is well established, but little is known about the spectrum and prevalence of human genetic variations and the functional implications in specific domains.\n\nExperimental ApproachHere we examine the impact of P2X2 receptor (P2X2R) inter-subunit interface missense variants identified in the human population or through structural predictions. We test both single and double mutants through electrophysiological and biochemical approaches.\n\nKey resultsWe demonstrate that predicted ECD inter-subunit interfaces display a higher-than-expected density of missense variations and that the majority of mutations that disrupt putative inter-subunit interactions result in channels with higher apparent ATP affinity. Lastly, we show that double mutants at the subunit interface show significant energetic coupling, especially if located in close proximity.\n\nConclusions and ImplicationsWe provide the first structural mapping of the mutational burden across the human population in a LGIC and show that the density of missense mutations is constrained between protein domains, indicating evolutionary selection at the domain level. Our data may indicate that, unlike other LGICs, P2X2Rs have evolved an intrinsically high threshold for activation, possibly to allow for additional modulation or as a cellular protection mechanism against overstimulation.\n\nBullet point summary What is already known: O_LIP2X2 receptors are ATP-activated ion channels implicated in hearing and nociceptice pathways\nC_LI\n What this study adds: O_LIA structural mapping of missense variants observed in the human population\nC_LIO_LIWe identify the intersubunit-interface as a variant hotspot and decipher functional impact of mutations\nC_LI\n Clinical significance: O_LIThe development of both inhibitors and activators of P2X2 receptor function may be required\nC_LI",

We hypothesised that platelets might be susceptible to activation by anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and contribute to thrombosis. We found that immune complexes containing recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and anti-spike IgG enhanced platelet-mediated thrombosis on von Willebrand Factor in vitro, but only when the glycosylation state of the Fc domain was modified to correspond with the aberrant glycosylation previously identified in patients with severe COVID-19. Furthermore, we found that activation was dependent on FcyRIIA and we provide in vitro evidence that this pathogenic platelet activation can be counteracted by therapeutic small molecules R406 (fostamatinib) and ibrutinib that inhibit tyrosine kinases syk and btk respectively or by the P2Y12 antagonist cangrelor.",

    "abstract": "Programmable site-specific nucleases, such as the CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), have allowed creation of valuable knockout mutations and targeted gene modifications in Chlamydomonas. However, in walled strains, present methods for editing genes lacking a selectable phenotype involve co-transfection of RNPs and exogenous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) encoding a selectable marker gene. Repair of the double-stranded DNA breaks induced by the ribonucleoproteins is usually accompanied by genomic insertion of exogenous dsDNA fragments, hindering the recovery of precise, scarless mutations in target genes of interest. In this study, we tested whether co-targeting two genes by electroporation of pairs of CRISPR/Cas9 RNPs and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) would facilitate the recovery of precise edits in a gene of interest (lacking a selectable phenotype) by selection for precise editing of another gene (creating a selectable marker) - in a process completely lacking exogenous dsDNA. We used PPX1 (encoding protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase) as the generated selectable marker, conferring resistance to oxyfluorfen, and identified precisely, scarless edited FTSY or WDTC1 genes in [~]1% of the oxyfluorfen resistant colonies. Analysis of the target site sequences in edited mutants suggested that ssODNs were used as templates for DNA synthesis during homology directed repair, a process prone to replicative errors. The Chlamydomonas acetolactate synthase gene could also be efficiently edited to serve as an alternative selectable marker. This transgene-free strategy may allow creation of individual strains containing precise mutations in multiple target genes, to study complex cellular processes, pathways or structures.\n\nOne sentence summaryCo-targeting two genes by co-electroporation of CRISPR/Cas9 RNPs and ssODN repair templates allows concomitant genome editing to create a selectable marker gene and to introduce precise modifications in another gene of interest.",

Maximizing the commonalities in the proteomic workflows between different biofluids simplifies the approach and increases the likelihood for reproducibility. We developed a workflow that allows flexibility for high and mid-throughput analysis for three blood-based proteomes: naive plasma, plasma depleted of the 14 most abundant proteins, and dried blood.\n\nMethodsOptimal conditions for sample preparation and DIA-MS analysis were established in plasma then automated and adapted for depleted plasma and whole blood. The MS workflow was modified to facilitate sensitive high-throughput or deep profile analysis with mid-throughput analysis. Analytical performance was evaluated from 5 complete workflows repeated over 3 days as well as a linearity analysis of a 5-6-point dilution curve.\n\nResultUsing our high-throughput workflow, 74%, 93%, 87% of peptides displayed an inter-day CV<30% in plasma, depleted plasma and whole blood. While the mid-throughput workflow had 67%, 90%, 78% of peptides in plasma, depleted plasma and whole blood meeting the CV<30% standard. Lower limits of detection and quantitation were determined for proteins and peptides observed in each biofluid and workflow. Combining the analysis of both high-throughput plasma fractions exceeded the number of reliably identified proteins for individual biofluids in the mid-throughput workflows.\n\nConclusionThe workflow established here allowed for reliable detection of proteins covering a broad dynamic range.

A total of 19 MHC class- I binders with HLA-A and HLA-B alleles have been selected with NetMHC pan EL 4.0 method from IEDB MHC-I prediction server. Four epitopes candidates from M-protein were selected based on the antigenicity, stability, immunogenicity, Ramachandran plot and scores with 100 % was taken for docking analysis with alleles HLA-A (PDB ID: 1B0R) and HLA-B (PDB ID: 3C9N) using ClusPro server. Among the four epitopes, the epitope FVLAAVYRI has the least binding energy and forms electrostatic, hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions with HLA-A (-932.8 Kcal/mol) and HLA-B (-860.7 Kcal/mol) which induce the T-cell response.

Although environmental, demographic and co-morbidity factors have an impact on the severity of the disease, contribution of the mutations in each of the viral genes towards the degree of severity needs a deeper understanding for designing a better therapeutic approach against COVID-19. Open Reading Frame-3a (ORF3a) protein has been found to be mutated at several positions. In this work, we have studied the effect of one of the most frequently occurring mutants, D155Y of ORF3a protein, found in Indian COVID-19 patients. Using computational simulations we demonstrated that the substitution at 155th changed the amino acids involved in salt bridge formation, hydrogen-bond occupancy, interactome clusters, and the stability of the protein compared with the other substitutions found in Indian patients. Protein-protein docking using HADDOCK analysis revealed that substitution D155Y weakened the binding affinity of ORF3a with caveolin-1 compared with the other substitutions, suggesting its importance in the overall stability of ORF3a-caveolin-1 complex, which may modulate the virulence property of SARS-CoV-2.",

However, delivery can be inefficient, and low abundance of template DNA may be one reason that precise editing typically occurs at a low rate. It has recently been shown that producing DNA inside cells can using reverse transcriptases can increase the efficiency of genome editing. One tool to produce that DNA is a retron, a bacterial retroelement that has an endogenous role in phage defense. However, little effort has been directed at optimizing the retron for production of designed sequences when used as a component of biotechnology. Here, we identify modifications to the retron non-coding RNA that result in more abundant reverse transcribed DNA. We also test architectures of the retron operon that enable efficient reverse transcription across kingdoms of life from bacteria, to yeast, to cultured human cells. We find that gains in DNA production using modified retrons are portable from prokaryotic to eukaryotic cells. Finally, we demonstrate that increased production of RT-DNA results in more efficient genome editing in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. These experiments provide a general framework for production of DNA using a retron for biotechnological applications.",

    "abstract": "Approximately half of the SARS-CoV-2 infections occur without apparent symptoms, raising questions regarding long-term humoral immunity in asymptomatic individuals. Plasma levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM) against the viral spike or nucleoprotein were determined for 25,091 individuals enrolled in a surveillance program in Wuhan, China. We compared 405 asymptomatic individuals with 459 symptomatic COVID-19 patients. The well-defined duration of the SARS-CoV-2 endemic in Wuhan allowed a side-by-side comparison of antibody responses following symptomatic and asymptomatic infections without subsequent antigen re-exposure. IgM responses rapidly declined in both groups. However, both the prevalence and durability of IgG responses and neutralizing capacities correlated positively with symptoms. Regardless of sex, age, and body weight, asymptomatic individuals lost their SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies more often and rapidly than symptomatic patients. These findings have important implications for immunity and favour immunization programs including individuals after asymptomatic infections.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryPrevalence and durability of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG responses and neutralizing capacities correlate with COVID-19 symptoms.",

However, the pleasant colour of processed meat products is a side effect of nitrite addition while the main anticipated goal is to suppress the germination of clostridial spores. The fungus Monascus is known as a producer of oligoketide pigments, which are used in Asian countries, especially in China, for colouring foods, including meat products. Although, different biological activities of Monascus pigments have been tested and confirmed in many studies, their effect on germination of bacterial spores has never been investigated. This study is focused on testing the activity of red yeast rice (RYR) extract, containing monascin, rubropunctatin, rubropunctamine complexes and monascuspiloin as the main pigments, on germination of Clostridium and Bacillus spores. It was found that addition of nitrite alone, at the permitted concentration, had no effect on spore germination. However, the combined effects of nitrite with NaCl, tested after addition of pickling salt, was efficient in inhibiting the germination of C. beijerinckii spores but had no effect on B. subtilis spores. In contrast, total suppression of C. beijerinckii spore germination was reached after addition of RYR extract to the medium at a concentration of 2 % v/v. For B. subtilis, total inhibition of spore germination was observed only after addition of 4 % v/v RYR extract to the medium containing 1.3% w/w NaCl.",

    "abstract": "Episodic inputs of labile carbon (C) to soil can rapidly stimulate nitrogen (N) immobilization by soil microorganisms. However, the transcriptional patterns that underlie this process remain unclear. In order to better understand the regulation of N cycling in soil microbial communities, we conducted a 48 h laboratory incubation with an agricultural soil where we stimulated the uptake of inorganic N by amending the soil with glucose. We analyzed the metagenome and metatranscriptome of the microbial communities at four timepoints that corresponded with changes in N availability. The relative abundances of genes remained largely unchanged throughout the incubation. In contrast, glucose addition rapidly increased transcription of genes encoding for ammonium and nitrate transporters, enzymes responsible for N assimilation into biomass, and genes associated with the N regulatory network. This upregulation coincided with an increase in transcripts associated with glucose breakdown and oxoglutarate production, demonstrating a connection between C and N metabolism. When concentrations of ammonium were low, we observed a transient upregulation of genes associated with the nitrogen fixing enzyme nitrogenase. Transcripts for nitrification and denitrification were downregulated throughout the incubation, suggesting that dissimilatory transformations of N may be suppressed in response to labile C inputs in these soils. These results demonstrate that soil microbial communities can respond rapidly to changes in C availability by drastically altering the transcription of N cycling genes.\n\nIMPORTANCEA large portion of activity in soil microbial communities occurs in short time frames in response to an increase in C availability, affecting the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen. These changes are of particular importance as nitrogen represents both a limiting nutrient for terrestrial plants as well as a potential pollutant. However, we lack a full understanding of the short-term effects of labile carbon inputs on the metabolism of microbes living in soil. Here, we found that soil microbial communities responded to labile carbon addition by rapidly transcribing genes encoding proteins and enzymes responsible for inorganic nitrogen acquisition, including nitrogen fixation. This work demonstrates that soil microbial communities respond within hours to carbon inputs through altered gene expression. These insights are essential for improved understanding of the microbial processes governing soil organic matter production, decomposition, and nutrient cycling in natural and agricultural ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of antimicrobial resistance represents a significant health and economic challenge worldwide. The slow pace of antibacterial discovery necessitates strategies for optimal use of existing agents, including effective diagnostics able to drive informed prescribing; and development of alternative therapeutic strategies that go beyond traditional small-molecule approaches. Thus, the development of novel probes able to target bacteria for detection and killing, and that can pave the way to effective theranostic strategies, is of great importance. Here we demonstrate that metal-free green-emitting fluorescent carbon dots (FCDs) synthesized from glucosamine HCl and m-phenylenediamine, and featuring 2,5-deoxyfructosazine on a robust amorphous core, can label both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacterial pathogens within 10 minutes of exposure. Moreover, effective killing of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria can be induced by combining FCD treatment with irradiation by LED light in the visible range. Cell-based, electron microscopy and Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) proteomic experiments indicate that FCD administration in combination with LED exposure gives rise to local heating, ROS production, and membrane- and DNA-damage, suggesting multiple routes to FCD-mediated bacterial killing. Our data identify FCDs as materials that combine facile synthesis from low-cost precursors with labelling and light-dependent killing of clinically important bacterial species, and that thus warrant further exploration as the potential bases for novel theranostics.",

    "abstract": "Neurotropic virus infection can cause serious damage to the central nervous system (CNS) in both human and animals. The complexity of the CNS poses unique challenges to investigate the infection of these viruses in the brain using traditional techniques. In this study, we explore the use of fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography (fMOST) and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map the spatial and cellular distribution of a representative neurotropic virus, rabies virus (RABV), in the whole brain. Mice were inoculated with a lethal dose of recombinant RABV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under different infection routes, and a three-dimensional view of the distribution of RABV in the whole mouse brain was obtained using fMOST. Meanwhile, we pinpointed the cellular distribution of RABV by utilizing scRNA-seq. Our fMOST data provide the first evidence that RABV can infect multiple nuclei related to fear independent of different infection routes. More surprisingly, scRNA-seq data indicate that besides neurons RABV can infect macrophages and NK cells in vivo. Collectively, this study draws a comprehensively spatial and cellular map of RABV infection in the mouse brain, providing a novel and insightful strategy to investigate the pathogenesis of neurotropic viruses.",

    "abstract": "Global waste production is increasing rapidly, with the majority of waste destined for landfills. Microbial communities in landfills transform waste and generate methane in an environment unique from other built and natural environments. Previous work has largely considered landfill microbial diversity only at the phylum level, identifying complex and variable communities. The extent of shared organismal diversity across landfills or over time and at more precise levels of classification remains unknown. We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomic sequencing to examine the taxonomic and functional diversity of the microbial communities inhabiting a Southern Ontario landfill. The diversity of microbial populations in leachate and groundwater samples was correlated with geochemical conditions to determine drivers of microbial heterogeneity. Across the landfill, 25 bacterial and archaeal phyla were present at >1% relative abundance within at least one landfill sample. The Patescibacteria, Bacteroidota, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria had the highest relative abundances, with most other phyla present at low (<5%) abundance. Below the phylum level, very few populations were identified at multiple sites, with only 121 of 8,030 populations present at five or more sites. This indicates that, although phylum-level signatures are conserved, individual landfill microbial populations vary widely. Significant differences in geochemistry occurred across the leachate and groundwater wells sampled, with calcium, iron, magnesium, boron, meta and para xylenes, ortho xylenes, and ethylbenzene concentrations contributing most strongly to observed site differences. This study illustrates that leachate microbial communities are much more complex and diverse within landfills than previously reported, with implications for waste management best practices.",

    "abstract": "DiSulfide Bond forming proteins (DSB) play a crucial role in the pathogenicity of many Gram-negative bacteria. Disulfide bond protein A (DsbA) catalyzes the formation of disulfide bonds necessary for the activity and stability of multiple substrate proteins, including many virulence factors. Hence, DsbA is an attractive target for the development of new drugs to combat bacterial infections. Here, we identified two fragments - 1 (bromophenoxy propanamide) and 2 (4-methoxy-N-phenylbenzenesulfonamide), that bind to the DsbA from the pathogenic bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis. Crystal structures of the oxidized B. pseudomallei DsbA (termed BpsDsbA) co-crystallized with 1 or 2 suggests that both fragments bind to a hydrophobic pocket that is formed by a change in the side chain orientation of tyrosine 110. This conformational change opens a \"cryptic\" pocket that is not evident in the apo-protein structure. This binding location was supported by 2D-NMR studies which identified a chemical shift perturbation of the tyrosine 110 backbone amide resonance of more than 0.05 ppm upon addition of 2 mM of fragment 1 and over 0.04 ppm upon addition of 1 mM of fragment 2. Although binding was detected by both X-ray crystallography and NMR, the binding affinity (KD) for both fragments was low (above 2 mM), suggesting weak interactions with BpsDsbA. This conclusion is also supported by the modelled crystal structures which ascribe partial occupancy to the ligands in the cryptic binding pocket. Small fragments such as 1 and 2 are not expected to have high binding affinity due to their size and the relatively small surface area that can be involved in intermolecular interactions. However, their simplicity makes them ideal for functionalization and optimization. Identification of the binding sites of 1 and 2 to BpsDsbA could provide a starting point for the development of more potent novel antimicrobial compounds that target DsbA and bacterial virulence.\n\nSynopsisDescribes the binding properties of two drug-like fragments to a conformationally dynamic site in the disulfide-bond forming protein A from Burkholderia pseudomallei.",

    "abstract": "Fast, reliable, and comprehensive biodiversity monitoring data are needed for environmental decision making and management. Recent work on fish environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding shows that aquatic diversity can be captured fast, reliably, and non-invasively at moderate costs. Because water in a catchment flows to the lowest point in the landscape, often a stream, it can often collect traces of terrestrial species via surface or subsurface runoff along its way or when specimens come into direct contact with water (e.g., for drinking purposes). Thus, fish eDNA metabarcoding data can provide information on fish but also on other vertebrate species that live in riparian habitats. This additional data may offer a much more comprehensive approach for assessing vertebrate diversity at no additional costs. Studies on how the sampling strategy affects species detection especially of stream-associated communities, however, are scarce. We therefore performed an analysis on the effects of biological replication on both fish as well as (semi-)terrestrial species detection. Along a 2 km stretch of the river Mulde (Germany), we collected 18 1-L water samples and analyzed the relation of detected species richness and quantity of biological replicates taken. We detected 58 vertebrate species, of which 25 were fish and lamprey, 18 mammals, and 15 birds, which account for 50%, 24%, and 7% of all native species to the German federal state of Saxony-Anhalt. However, while increasing the number of biological replicates resulted in only 25% more detected fish and lamprey species, mammal, and bird species richness increased disproportionately by 69% and 84%, respectively. Contrary, PCR replicates showed little stochasticity. We thus emphasize to increase the number of biological replicates when the aim is to improve general species detections. This holds especially true, when the focus is on rare aquatic taxa or on (semi-)terrestrial species, the so-called  bycatch. As a clear advantage, this information can be obtained without any additional sampling or laboratory effort when the sampling strategy is chosen carefully. With the increased use of eDNA metabarcoding as part of national fish bioassessment and monitoring programs, the complimentary information provided on bycatch can be used for biodiversity monitoring and conservation on a much broader scale.",

    "abstract": "More than half of human tumors exhibit aberrantly dysregulated phosphoinositide signaling, yet how this is controlled remains not fully understood. While somatic mutations of PI3K, PTEN and Ras account for many cases of the hyperactivated lipid signals, other mechanisms for these dysfunctions in cancer are also being discovered. We report here that TNFAIP8 interacts with PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and is likely to be hijacked by cancer cells to facilitate directional migration during malignant transformation. TNFAIP8 maintains the quiescent cellular state by sequestering inactive Rho GTPases in the cytosolic pool, which can be set free upon chemoattractant activation at the leading edge. Consequently, loss of TNFAIP8 results in severe defects of chemotaxis and adhesion. Thus, TNFAIP8, whose expression can be induced by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF from tumor microenvironment, represents a molecular bridge from inflammation to cancer by linking NF-{kappa}B pathway to phosphoinositide signaling. Our study on the conserved hydrophobic cavity structure will also advise in silico drug screening and development of new TNFAIP8-based strategies to combat malignant human diseases.",

While the evolution of different virulence levels is well studied, the evolution of host resistance in response to different virulence levels is less understood and as of now mainly based on observations and theoretical predictions with few experimental tests. Increased virulence can increase selection for host resistance evolution if resistance costs are outweighed by the benefits of avoiding infection. To test this, we experimentally evolved the bacterium Vibrio alginolyticus in the presence of two variants of the filamentous phage, VALG{Phi}8, that differ in their virulence. The bacterial host exhibited two alternative defence strategies against future phage infection: (1) super infection exclusion (SIE) whereby phage-infected cells were immune to subsequent infection at a cost of reduced growth, and (2) surface receptor mutations (SRM) in genes encoding the MSHA type-IV pilus providing resistance to infection by preventing phage attachment. While SIE emerged rapidly against both phages, SRM evolved faster against the high virulence compared to the low virulence phage. Using a mathematical model of our system we show that increasing virulence strengthens selection for SRM due to the higher costs of infection suffered by SIE immune hosts. In both the experiments and the model, higher levels of SRM in the host population drove more rapid phage extinction. Thus, by accelerating the evolution of host resistance, more virulent phages caused shorter epidemics.",

Using the latest reagents coupled with tried and tested methodologies, we continue to uncover previously undetected structural proteins in mature intervertebral disc. In this study we show that the \"embryonic\" type IIA procollagen isoform (containing a cysteine-rich amino propeptide) was biochemically detectable in the annulus fibrosus of both calf and mature steer intervertebral discs, but not in the nucleus pulposus where the type IIB isoform was predominantly localized. Specifically, the triple-helical type IIA procollagen isoform immunolocalized in the outer margins of the inner annulus fibrosus. Triple helical processed type II collagen exclusively localized within the interlamellae regions and with type IIA procollagen in the intra-lamellae regions. Mass spectrometry of the 1 (II) collagen chains from the region where type IIA procollagen localized showed high 3-hydroxylation of Proline-944, a post-translational modification that is correlated with thin collagen fibrils as in the nucleus pulposus. The findings implicate small diameter fibrils of type IIA procollagen in select regions of the annulus fibrosus where it likely contributes to the organization of collagen bundles and structural properties within the type I-type II collagen transition zone.",

    "abstract": "The biochemical and biomedical fields hinge on the ability to effectively separate and purify biological macromolecules. Though this need is largely addressed with a variety of chromatographic and electrophoretic purification techniques, such techniques are usually laborious, time-consuming, and often require complex and costly instalments that are inaccessible to most laboratories. In this work, we introduce a simple micro-preparative (MP) method based on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to purify biological samples containing proteins, nucleic acids, and complex bioconjugates. Using a conventional vertical slab system, we demonstrate the extraction of purified DNA, proteins, and DNA-protein bioconjugates from their respective mixtures using MP-PAGE. We apply this system to recover DNA from a ladder mixture with yields of up to 90%, compared to the 58% yield obtained using specialized commercial devices. We also demonstrate the purification of folded enhanced yellow fluorescence protein (EYFP) from crude cell extract with 90% purity, comparable to purities achieved using a two-step size exclusion and immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography purification procedure. Finally, we demonstrate the successful isolation of an EYFP-DNA bioconjugate sample that otherwise could not be processed using the two-step chromatography procedure. MP-PAGE thus offers a rapid and versatile means of purifying a variety of biomolecules without the need for specialized equipment.",

The PPI network mediated by the transcriptional coactivator Med25, for example, regulates stress-response and motility pathways and dysregulation of the PPI networks contributes to oncogenesis and metastasis. The canonical transcription factor binding sites within Med25 are large (~900 [A]2) and have little topology, and thus do not present an array of attractive small-molecule binding sites for inhibitor discovery. Here we demonstrate that the depsidone natural product norstictic acid functions through an alternative binding site to block Med25-transcriptional activator PPIs in vitro and in cell culture. Norstictic acid targets a binding site comprised of a highly dynamic loop flanking one canonical binding surface and in doing so, it both orthosterically and allosterically alters Med25-driven transcription in a patient-derived model of triple negative breast cancer. These results highlight the potential of Med25 as a therapeutic target as well as the inhibitor discovery opportunities presented by structurally dynamic loops within otherwise challenging proteins.",

    "abstract": "Membrane protein variants with diminished conformational stability often exhibit enhanced cellular expression at reduced growth temperatures. The expression of \"temperature-sensitive\" variants is also typically sensitive to corrector molecules that bind and stabilize the native conformation. In this work, we employ deep mutational scanning to compare the effects of reduced growth temperature and an investigational corrector (9-cis-retinal) on the plasma membrane expression of 700 rhodopsin variants in HEK293T cells. We find that the change in expression at reduced growth temperatures is correlated with the response to retinal among variants bearing mutations within a hydrophobic transmembrane domain (TM2). The most sensitive variants within this helix appear to disrupt a network of hydrogen bonds that stabilizes a native helical kink. By comparison, mutants that alter a polar transmembrane domain (TM7) exhibit weaker responses to temperature and retinal that are poorly correlated. Statistical analyses suggest this insensitivity primarily arises from an abundance of mutations that enhance its membrane integration, stabilize its native conformation, and/ or perturb the retinal binding pocket. Finally, we show that the characteristics of purified temperature- and retinal-sensitive variants suggest that the proteostatic effects of retinal may be manifested during translation and cotranslational folding. Together, our findings elucidate various factors that mediate the sensitivity of genetic variants to temperature and to small molecule correctors.",

This incredible growth speed empowers V. natriegens as a chassis for synthetic and molecular biology, potentially replacing E. coli in many applications. While first genetic parts have been built and tested for V. natriegens, a comprehensive toolkit containing well-characterized and standardized parts did not exist. To close this gap, we created the Marburg Collection - a highly flexible Golden Gate Assembly-based cloning toolbox optimized for the emerging chassis organism V. natriegens. The Marburg Collection overcomes the paradigm of plasmid construction - integrating inserts into a backbone - by enabling the de novo assembly of plasmids from basic genetic parts. This allows users to select the plasmid replication origin and resistance part independently, which is highly advantageous when limited knowledge about the behavior of those parts in the target organism is available. Additional design highlights of the Marburg Collection are novel connector parts, which facilitate modular circuit assembly and, optionally, the inversion of individual transcription units to reduce transcriptional crosstalk in multigene constructs. To quantitatively characterize the genetic parts contained in the Marburg Collection in V. natriegens, we developed a reliable microplate reader measurement workflow for reporter experiments and overcame organismspecific challenges. We think the Marburg Collection with its thoroughly characterized parts will provide a valuable resource for the growing V. natriegens community.",

Here, we show significant sex differences in serum concentrations of HMGB1, a non-histone chromatin-associated protein, and numbers of pigmented monocytes, which are both markers of severe malaria, in infants <5 years old from a malaria endemic region in Northern Uganda. Female infants with clinical malaria had significantly higher HMGB1 concentrations than male infants, and female infants with asymptomatic malaria had significantly lower numbers of pigmented monocytes than male infants with asymptomatic malaria. There was (1) a significant correlation between HMGB1 concentrations and pigmented monocyte numbers in female but not male infants; and (2) a significant correlation between HMGB1 concentrations and parasite densities in female but not male infants. These findings suggest that female infants with clinical malaria might be at a greater risk of morbidity characterized by higher serum HMGB1 levels.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria can utilize Copper (Cu) as a trace element to support cellular processes; however, excess Cu can intoxicate bacteria. Here, we characterize the cop operon in group B streptococcus (GBS), and establish its role in evasion of Cu intoxication and the response to Cu stress on virulence. Growth of GBS mutants deficient in either the copA Cu exporter, or the copY repressor, were severely compromised in Cu-stress conditions. GBS survival of Cu stress reflected a mechanism of CopY de-repression of the CopA efflux system. However, neither mutant was attenuated for intracellular survival in macrophages. Analysis of global transcriptional responses to Cu by RNA-sequencing revealed a stress signature encompassing homeostasis of multiple metals. Genes induced by Cu stress included putative metal transporters for manganese import, whereas a system for iron export was repressed. In addition, copA promoted the ability of GBS to colonize the blood, liver and spleen of mice following disseminated infection. Together, these findings show that GBS copA mediates resistance to Cu intoxication, via regulation by the Cu-sensing transcriptional repressor, copY. Cu stress responses in GBS reflect a transcriptional signature that heightens virulence and represents an important part of the bacterias ability to survive in different environments.\n\nImportanceUnderstanding how bacteria manage cellular levels of metal ions, such as copper, helps to explain how microbial cells can survive in different stressful environments. We show how the opportunistic pathogen group B Streptococcus (GBS) achieves homeostasis of intracellular copper through the activities of the genes that comprise the cop operon, and describe how this helps GBS survive in stressful environments, including in the mammalian host during systemic disseminated infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInsecticide resistance among mosquito species is now a pervasive phenomenon, which threatens to jeopardise global malaria vector control efforts. Evidence of links between the mosquito microbiota and insecticide resistance is emerging, with significant enrichment of insecticide degrading bacteria and enzymes in resistant populations. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we characterised and compared the microbiota of Anopheles (An.) coluzzii in relation to their deltamethrin resistance and exposure profiles.\n\nResultsComparisons between 2-3 day old deltamethrin resistant and susceptible mosquitoes, demonstrated significant differences in microbiota diversity (PERMANOVA, pseudo-F = 19.44, p=0.0015). Ochrobactrum, Lysinibacillus and Stenotrophomonas genera, each of which comprised insecticide degrading species, were significantly enriched in resistant mosquitoes. Susceptible mosquitoes had a significant reduction in alpha diversity compared to resistant individuals (Shannon index: H=13.91, q=0.0003, Faiths phylogenetic diversity: H=6.68, q=0.01), with Asaia and Serratia dominating microbial profiles. There was no significant difference in deltamethrin exposed and unexposed 5-6 day old individuals, suggesting that insecticide exposure had minimal impact on microbial composition. Serratia and Asaia were also dominant in 5-6 day old mosquitoes, regardless of exposure or phenotype, and had reduced microbial diversity compared with 2-3 day old mosquitoes.\n\nConclusionsOur findings revealed significant alterations of An. coluzzii microbiota associated with deltamethrin resistance, highlighting the potential for identification of novel microbial markers for insecticide resistance surveillance. qPCR detection of Serratia and Asaia was consistent with 16S rRNA sequencing, suggesting that population level field screening of the bacterial microbiota may be feasibly integrated into wider resistance monitoring if reliable and reproducible markers associated with phenotype can be identified.",

    "abstract": "Arthropod endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis is part of a global biocontrol strategy to reduce the replication of mosquito-borne RNA viruses such as alphaviruses. We previously demonstrated the importance of a host cytosine methyltransferase, DNMT2, in Drosophila and viral RNA as a cellular target during pathogen-blocking. Here we report on the role of DNMT2 in Wolbachia-induced alphavirus inhibition in Aedes species. Expression of DNMT2 in mosquito tissues, including the salivary glands, is elevated upon virus infection. Notably, this is suppressed in Wolbachia-colonized animals, coincident with reduced virus replication and decreased infectivity of progeny virus. Ectopic expression of DNMT2 in cultured Aedes cells is proviral, increasing progeny virus infectivity, and this effect of DNMT2 on virus replication and infectivity is dependent on its methyltransferase activity. Finally, examining the effects of Wolbachia on modifications of viral RNA by LC-MS show a decrease in the amount of 5-methylcytosine modification consistent with the down-regulation of DNMT2 in Wolbachia colonized mosquito cells and animals. Collectively, our findings support the conclusion that disruption of 5-methylcytosine modification of viral RNA is a vital mechanism operative in pathogen blocking. These data also emphasize the essential role of epitranscriptomic modifications in regulating fundamental alphavirus replication and transmission processes.",

Heritable responses to bacterial pathogens in the nematode include avoidance and pathogen-induced diapause (PIDF), a state of suspended animation to evade the pathogen threat. We identify a small RNA RsmY, involved in quorum sensing from P. aeruginosa as required for initiation of PIDF. Histone methyltransferase SET-18/SMYD3 is also needed for PIDF initiation in C. elegans. In contrast, SET-25/EHMT2 is necessary for the maintenance of the memory of pathogen exposure in the transgenerational lineage.

    "abstract": "Dickeya dadantii is an important pathogenic bacterium that infects a number of crops including potato and chicory. While extensive works have been carried out on the control of the transcription of its genes encoding the main virulence functions, little information is available on the post-transcriptional regulation of these functions. We investigated the involvement of the RNA chaperones Hfq and ProQ in the production of the main D. dadantii virulence functions. Phenotypic assays on the hfq and proQ mutants showed that inactivation of hfq resulted in a growth defect, a modified capacity for biofilm formation and strongly reduced motility, and in the production of degradative extracellular enzymes (proteases, cellulase and pectate lyases). Accordingly, the hfq mutant failed to cause soft rot on chicory leaves. The proQ mutant had reduced resistance to osmotic stress, reduced extracellular pectate lyase activity compared to the wild-type strain, and reduced virulence on chicory leaves. Most of the phenotypes of the hfq and proQ mutants were related to the low amounts of mRNA of the corresponding virulence factors. Complementation of the double mutant hfq-proQ by each individual protein and cross-complementation of each chaperone suggested that they might exert their effects via partially overlapping but different sets of targets. Overall, it clearly appeared that the two Hfq and ProQ RNA chaperones are important regulators of pathogenicity in D. dadantii. This underscores that virulence genes are regulated post transcriptionally by non-coding RNAs.",

CRIPSR/Cas9 gene editing was performed on DBA/2 embryonic stem cells to change the Pycard 3UTR SNP from the DBA/2 to the AKR allele. This single base change significantly reduced Pycard expression and inflammasome activity after cells were differentiated into macrophages due to reduced Pycard mRNA stability.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal translocations frequently promote carcinogenesis by producing gain-of-function fusion proteins. Recent studies have identified highly recurrent chromosomal translocations in patients with Endometrial Stromal Sarcomas (ESS) and Ossifying FibroMyxoid Tumors (OFMT) leading to an in-frame fusion of PHF1 (PCL1) to six different subunits of the NuA4/TIP60 complex. While NuA4/TIP60 is a co-activator that acetylates chromatin and loads the H2A.Z histone variant, PHF1 is part of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) linked to transcriptional repression of key developmental genes through methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27. In this study, we characterize the fusion protein produced by the EPC1-PHF1 translocation. The chimeric protein assembles a mega-complex harboring both NuA4/TIP60 and PRC2 activities and leads to mislocalization of chromatin marks in the genome, in particular over an entire topologically- associating domain including part of the HOXD cluster. This is linked to aberrant gene expression, most notably increased expression of PRC2 target genes. Furthermore, we show that JAZF1, implicated with a PRC2 component in the most frequent translocation in ESS, JAZF1-SUZ12, is a potent transcription activator that physically associates with NuA4/TIP60, its fusion creating similar outcomes as EPC1-PHF1. Importantly, the specific increased expression of PRC2 targets/HOX genes was also confirmed with ESS patient samples. Altogether, these results indicate that most chromosomal translocations linked to these sarcomas employ the same molecular oncogenic mechanism through a physical merge of NuA4/TIP60 and PRC2 complexes leading to mislocalization of histone marks and aberrant polycomb target gene expression.",

    "abstract": "While de novo collagen fibril formation is well-studied, there are few investigations into the growth and remodeling of extant fibrils, where molecular collagen incorporation into and erosion from the fibril surface must delicately balance during fibril growth and remodeling. Observing molecule/fibril interactions is difficult, requiring the tracking of molecular dynamics while, at the same time, minimizing the effect of the observation on fibril structure and assembly. To address the observation-interference problem, exogenous collagen molecules are tagged with small fluorophores and the fibrillogenesis kinetics of labeled collagen molecules as well as the structure and network morphology of assembled fibrils are quantified for the first time. While excessive labeling significantly disturbs fibrillogenesis kinetics and network morphology of assembled fibrils, adding less than ~1.2 labels preserves them. Applications of the functional, labeled collagen probe are demonstrated in both cellular and acellular systems. The functional, labelled collagen associates strongly with native fibrils and when added to an in vitro model of corneal stromal development, is endocytosed rapidly by cells and is translocated into synthesized matrix networks within 24 hours.",

    "abstract": "From cellular mechanotransduction to the formation of embryonic tissues and organs, mechanics has been shown to play an important role in the control of cell behavior and embryonic development. Most of our existing knowledge of how mechanics affects cell behavior comes from in vitro studies, mainly because measuring cell and tissue mechanics in 3D multicellular systems, and especially in vivo, remains challenging. Oil microdroplet sensors, and more recently gel microbeads, use surface deformations to directly quantify mechanical stresses within developing tissues, in vivo and in situ, as well as in 3D in vitro systems like organoids or multicellular spheroids. However, an automated analysis software able to quantify the spatiotemporal evolution of stresses and their characteristics from particle deformations is lacking. Here we develop STRESS (Surface Topography Reconstruction for Evaluation of Spatiotemporal Stresses), an analysis software to quantify the geometry of deformable particles of spherical topology, such as microdroplets or gel microbeads, that enables the automatic quantification of the temporal evolution of stresses in the system and the spatiotemporal features of stress inhomogeneities in the tissue. As a test case, we apply these new code to measure the temporal evolution of mechanical stresses using oil microdroplets in developing zebrafish tissues. Starting from a 3D timelapse of a droplet, the software automatically calculates the statistics of local anisotropic stresses, decouples the deformation modes associated with tissue- and cell-scale stresses, obtains their spatial features on the droplet surface and analyzes their spatiotemporal variations using spatial and temporal stress autocorrelations. The automated nature of the analysis will help users obtain quantitative information about mechanical stresses in a wide range of 3D multicellular systems, from developing embryos or tissue explants to organoids.\n\nAuthor summaryThe measurement of mechanical stresses in 3D multicellular systems, such as living tissues, has been very challenging because of a lack in technologies for this purpose. Novel microdroplet techniques enable direct, quantitative in situ measurements of mechanical stresses in these systems. However, computational tools to obtain mechanical stresses from 3D images of microdroplets in an automated and accurate manner are lacking. Here we develop STRESS, an automated analysis software to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of mechanical stresses from microdroplet deformations in a wide range of systems, from living embryonic tissues and tissue explants to organoids and multicellular spheroids.",

    "abstract": "Participation in womens rugby league has been growing since the foundation of the English womens rugby league Super League in 2017. However, the evidence base to inform womens rugby league remains sparse. This study provides the largest quantification of anthropometric and physical qualities of womens rugby league players to date, identifying differences between positions (forwards & backs) and playing standard (Womens Super League [WSL] vs. International). The height, weight, body composition, lower body strength, jump height, speed and aerobic capacity of 207 players were quantified during the pre-season period. Linear mixed models and effects sizes were used to determine differences between positions and standards. Forwards were significantly (p < 0.05) heavier (forwards: 82.5 {+/-} 14.8kg; backs: 67.7 {+/-} 9.2kg) and have a greater body fat % (forwards: 37.7 {+/-} 6.9%; backs: 30.4 {+/-} 6.3%) than backs. Backs had significantly greater lower body power measured via jump height (forwards: 23.5 {+/-} 4.4cm; backs: 27.6 {+/-} 4.9cm), speed over 10m (forwards: 2.12 {+/-} 0.14s; backs: 1.98 {+/-} 0.11s), 20m (forwards: 3.71 {+/-} 0.27s; backs: 3.46 {+/-} 0.20s), 30m (forwards: 5.29 {+/-} 0.41s; backs: 4.90 {+/-} 0.33s), 40m (forwards: 6.91 {+/-} 0.61s; backs: 6.33 {+/-} 0.46s) and aerobic capacity (forwards: 453.4 {+/-} 258.8m; backs: 665.0 {+/-} 298.2m) than forwards. Additionally, international players were found to have greater anthropometric and physical qualities in comparison to their WSL counterparts. This study adds to the limited evidence base surrounding the anthropometric and physical qualities of elite womens rugby league players. Comparative values for anthropometric and physical qualities are provided which practitioners may use to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of players, informing training programs to prepare players for the demands of womens rugby league.",

    "abstract": "Over half a century ago, George Zipf observed that more frequent words tend to be older. Corpus studies since then have confirmed this pattern, with more frequent words being replaced and regularized less often than less frequent words. Two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain this: that frequent words change less because selection against innovation is stronger at higher frequencies, or that they change less because stochastic drift is stronger at lower frequencies. Here, we report the first experimental test of these hypotheses. Participants were tasked with learning a miniature language consisting of two nouns and two plural markers. Nouns occurred at different frequencies and were subjected to treatments that varied drift and selection. Using a model that accounts for participant heterogeneity, we measured the rate of noun regularization, the strength of selection, and the strength of drift in participant responses. Results suggest that drift alone is sufficient to generate the elevated rate of regularization we observed in low-frequency nouns, adding to a growing body of evidence that drift may be a major driver of language change.",

    "abstract": "As one of the most successful categories of organisms, mammals occupy a variety of niches on earth as a result of macroevolution. Transcription factors (TFs), the basic regulators of gene expression, may also evolve during mammalian phenotypic diversification and macroevolution. To examine the relationship between TFs and mammalian macroevolution, we analyzed 140,821 de novo-identified TFs and their birth and death histories from 96 mammalian species. Gene tree vs. species tree reconciliation revealed that mammals experienced an upsurge in TF losses around 100 million years ago and also near the K-Pg boundary, thus implying a relationship with the divergence of placental animals. From approximately 100 million years ago to the present, losses dominated TF events without a significant change in TF gains. To quantify the effects of this TF pruning on mammalian macroevolution, we analyzed rates of molecular evolution and expression profiles of regulated target genes. Surprisingly, TF loss decelerated, rather than accelerated, molecular evolutionary rates of their target genes, suggesting increased functional constraints. Furthermore, an association study revealed that massive TF losses are significantly positively correlated with solitary behavior, nocturnality, reproductive-seasonality and insectivory life history traits, possibly through rewiring of regulatory networks.",

Raw data can be explored by simultaneously examining song events, both individually and in the context of the entire recording, watching synced video, and listening to song. We provide a simple way to visualize many song events from large datasets within an interactive low-dimensional visualization, which facilitates detection and correction of incorrectly labelled song events. The machine learning model we implemented displays higher accuracy than existing heuristic algorithms and similar accuracy as two expert human annotators. We show that SongExplorer allows rapid detection of all song types from new species and of novel song types in previously well-studied species.",

    "abstract": "Many methods have been developed for statistical analysis of microbial community profiles, but due to the complex nature of typical microbiome measurements (e.g. sparsity, zero-inflation, nonindependence, and compositionality) and of the associated underlying biology, it is difficult to compare or evaluate such methods within a single systematic framework. To address this challenge, we developed SparseDOSSA (Sparse Data Observations for the Simulation of Synthetic Abundances): a statistical model of microbial ecological population structure, which can be used to parameterize real-world microbial community profiles and to simulate new, realistic profiles of known structure for methods evaluation. Specifically, SparseDOSSAs model captures marginal microbial feature abundances as a zero-inflated log-normal distribution, with additional model components for absolute cell counts and the sequence read generation process, microbemicrobe, and microbe-environment interactions. Together, these allow fully known covariance structure between synthetic features (i.e. \"taxa\") or between features and \"phenotypes\" to be simulated for method benchmarking. Here, we demonstrate SparseDOSSAs performance for 1) accurately modeling human-associated microbial population profiles; 2) generating synthetic communities with controlled population and ecological structures; 3) spiking-in true positive synthetic associations to benchmark analysis methods; and 4) recapitulating an end-to-end mouse microbiome feeding experiment. Together, these represent the most common analysis types in assessment of real microbial community environmental and epidemiological statistics, thus demonstrating SparseDOSSAs utility as a general-purpose aid for modeling communities and evaluating quantitative methods.

Data on the morphological separation between Anchomanes and Pseudohydrosme are reviewed. Although phylogenomic studies may show in future that the two genera need to be merged, for the moment their separation is reinforced on morphological grounds. Anchomanes lacks the spathe tube, ovoid-globose, 2 - 4 locular pistil and thick, lobed stigma on a symmetric, stout style that we show to characterise the redelimited Pseudohydrosme.

In addition, Pseudohydrosme (where known) has stipitate (versus sessile) fruits and on current evidence lacks the lacticifers recorded from Anchomanes. We test the hypothesis that the taxon is a new species to science, naming it as Pseudohydrosme bogneri, and conclude that it is Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) using the IUCN 2012 standard.

    "abstract": "Recognizing others social interactions is a crucial human ability. Using simple stimuli, previous studies have shown that social interactions are selectively processed in the superior temporal sulcus (STS), but prior work with movies has suggested that social interactions are processed in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), part of the theory of mind network. It remains unknown to what extent social interaction selectivity is observed in real world stimuli when controlling for other covarying perceptual and social information, such as faces, voices, and theory of mind. The current study utilizes a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) movie paradigm and advanced machine learning methods to uncover the brain mechanisms uniquely underlying naturalistic social interaction perception. We analyzed two publicly available fMRI datasets, collected while both male and female human participants (n = 17 and 18) watched two different commercial movies in the MRI scanner. By performing voxel-wise encoding and variance partitioning analyses, we found that broad social-affective features predict neural responses in social brain regions, including the STS and mPFC. However, only the STS showed robust and unique selectivity specifically to social interactions, independent from other covarying features. This selectivity was observed across two separate fMRI datasets. These findings suggest that naturalistic social interaction perception recruits dedicated neural circuity in the STS, separate from the theory of mind network, and is a critical dimension of human social understanding.\n\nSignificance StatementSocial interaction perception guides our daily behavior, yet it is unknown how our brain processes real-world social interaction scenes. Here, we demonstrate that social brain areas, including the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), are sensitive to broad social-affective information in naturalistic movies, replicating prior results with controlled paradigms. We show for the first time however, that the STS, but not mPFC, selectively processes social interactions in natural movies, independent of other co-occurring perceptual and social features, including motion, presence of faces, speech, and mentalizing about others. Our results suggest that social interaction perception is a crucial dimension of social understanding represented in the human brain.",

    "abstract": "Over the years, several publications have proposed that musical sound could be an ancestral emotional way of communication, thus positing an ancestral biological function for music. Understanding how musical emotions, and the pleasure derived from music regardless of the musical valence, can be shared between individuals is a fascinating question, and investigating it can shed light on the function of musical reward. Is the pleasure felt at the individual level transmitted on a collective level? And if so, how? We investigated these questions in a natural setting during an international competition for orchestra conductors. Participants (n=15) used a dedicated smartphone app to report their subjective emotional experiences in real time during a concert. We recorded participants electrodermal activity (EDA) and cerebral activity with electroencephalography (EEG). The overall behavioral real time ratings suggest a possible social influence on the reported and felt pleasure. The physically closer the participants, the more similar their reported pleasure. We estimated the inter-individual cerebral coherence, which indicates the degree of mutual cerebral information between pairs of participants in the frequency domain. The results show that when people simultaneously reported either high or low pleasure, their cerebral activities were closer than for simultaneous neutral pleasure reports. Participants skin conductance levels were also more coupled when reporting higher emotional degrees simultaneously. More importantly, the participants who were physically closer had higher cerebral coherence, but only when they simultaneously reported intense pleasure. We propose that mechanisms of emotional contagion and/or emotional resonance could explain why a form of  emotional connecting force could arise between people.",

    "abstract": "Volitional suppression of responses to distracting external stimuli enables us to achieve our goals. This volitional inhibition of a specific behavior is supposed to be mainly mediated by the cerebral cortex. However, recent evidence supports the involvement of the cerebellum in this process. It is currently not known whether different parts of the cerebellar cortex play differential or synergistic roles in planning and execution of this behavior. Here, we measured Purkinje cell (PC) responses in the medial and lateral cerebellum in two rhesus macaques during a pro- and antisaccade task. During an antisaccade trial, non-human primates were instructed to make a saccadic eye movement away from a target, rather than towards it, as in prosaccade trials. Our data shows that the cerebellum plays an important role not only during execution of the saccades, but also during the volitional inhibition of eye movements towards the target. Simple Spike (SS) modulation during the instruction and execution period of pro- and antisaccades was prominent in PCs of both medial and lateral cerebellum. However, only the SS activity in the lateral cerebellar cortex contained information about trial identity and showed a stronger reciprocal interaction with complex spikes. Moreover, SS activity of different PC groups modulated bidirectionally in both regions, but the PCs that showed facilitating and suppressive activity were predominantly associated with instruction and execution, respectively. These findings show that different cerebellar regions and PC groups contribute to goal-directed behavior and volitional inhibition, but with different propensities, highlighting the rich repertoire of cerebellar control in executive functions.\n\nSignificance StatementThe antisaccade task is commonly used in research and clinical evaluation as a test of volitional and flexible control of behavior. It requires volitional suppression of prosaccades, a function that has been attributed to the neocortex. However, recent findings indicate that cerebellum also contributes to this behavior. We recorded from neurons in the medial and lateral cerebellum to evaluate their responses in this task. We found that both regions significantly modulated their activity during this task, but only cells in the lateral cerebellum encoded the stimulus identity in each trial. These results indicate that the cerebellum actively contributes to the control of flexible behavior and that lateral and medial cerebellum play different roles during volitional eye movements.",

    "abstract": "Cell migration is a hallmark out-of-equilibrium process in biology. In addition to persistent self-propelled motion, many cells display remarkable adaptive behaviors when they navigate complex environments within the body. Combining theory and experiments, we identify a curvature-sensing mechanism underlying obstacle avoidance in immune-like cells. The genetic perturbation of this machinery leads to a reduced capacity to evade obstructions combined with faster and more persistent cell migration in obstacle-free environments. We propose that the active polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton at the advancing edge of migrating cells is locally inhibited by the curvature-sensitive BAR protein Snx33 in regions with inward plasma membrane curvature. This coupling between actin and membrane dynamics leads to a mechanochemical instability that generates complex protrusive patterns at the cellular front. Adaptive motility thus arises from two simultaneous curvature-dependent effects, i) the specific reduction of propulsion in regions where external objects deform the plasma membrane and ii) the intrinsic patterning capacity due to the membrane-actin coupling that promotes spontaneous changes in the cells protrusions. Our results show how cells utilize actin- and plasma membrane biophysics to sense their environment, allowing them to adaptively decide if they should move ahead or turn away. On the basis of our findings, we propose that the natural diversity of BAR proteins may allow cells to tune their curvature sensing machinery to match the shape characteristics in their environment.",

    "abstract": "Predicting both the absolute and the relative abundance of species in a spatial patch is of paramount interest in areas like, agriculture, ecology and environmental science.\n\nThe linear Lotka-Volterra generalized equations (LLVGE) serve for describing the dynamics of communities of species connected by negative as well as positive interspecific interactions.\n\nHere we particularize these LLVGE to the case of single trophic ecological communities, like mixtures of plants, with S >2 species. Thus, by estimating the LLVGE parameters from the yields in monoculture and biculture experiments, the LLVGE are able to produce decently accurate predictions for species yields.\n\nHowever, a common situation we face is that we dont know all the parameters appearing in the LLVGE. Indeed, for large values of S, only a fraction of the experiments necessary for estimating the model parameters is commonly carried out. We then analyze which quantitative predictions are possible with an incomplete knowledge of the parameters.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing recognition that ecological systems can spend extended periods of time far away from an asymptotic state, and that ecological understanding will therefore require a deeper appreciation for how long ecological transients arise. Recent work has defined classes of deterministic mechanisms that can lead to long transients. Given the ubiquity of stochasticity in ecological systems, a similar systematic treatment of transients that includes the influence of stochasticity is important. Stochasticity can of course promote the appearance of transient dynamics by preventing systems from settling permanently near their asymptotic state, but stochasticity also interacts with deterministic features to create qualitatively new dynamics. As such, stochasticity may shorten, extend, or fundamentally change a systems transient dynamics. Here, we describe a general framework that is developing for understanding the range of possible outcomes when random processes impact the dynamics of ecological systems over realistic time scales. We emphasize that we can understand the ways in which stochasticity can either extend or reduce the lifetime of transients by studying the interactions between the stochastic and deterministic processes present, and we summarize both the current state of knowledge and avenues for future advances.",
