    "abstract": "CDK8 encodes an evolutionarily conserved Mediator complex kinase subunit that functions in general and context-specific transcription regulation by phosphorylating core components of the transcription machinery and gene-specific transcription factors. To better understand the role Cdk8 in transcription regulation, we performed high-resolution gene expression time course analysis following nuclear depletion of Cdk8. Focusing on the earliest gene expression alterations revealed dysregulation of genes encoding glycolysis enzymes, suggesting a functional link to Gcr1 and Gcr2, key transcriptional activators of these genes. Consistently, we found that nuclear depletion of Cdk8 altered the mRNA levels of glycolysis genes as well as the promoter occupancy of Gcr2, but not Gcr1. Examination of the Gcr2 protein sequence revealed a putative Cdk8 phosphorylation site at serine 365, which we confirmed using in vitro and in vivo assays. Importantly, phospho-mutant GCR2 recapitulated the growth and gene expression defects of the GCR2 deletion mutant, effects not observed with a phospho mimetic mutant. As such, our work highlights Gcr2 as a new Cdk8 substrate, revealing that its phosphorylation is critical for the activation of genes encoding glycolysis enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Rapid proliferation of Plasmodium falciparum parasites in human red blood cells is the cause of malaria and is underpinned by an unconventional cell division mode, called schizogony. Contrary to model organisms, P. falciparum replicates by multiple rounds of closed and asynchronous nuclear divisions that are not interrupted by cytokinesis. Organization and dynamics of the critical nuclear division factors are, however, poorly understood. Centriolar plaques, the centrosomes of P. falciparum, are important regulators of division and serve as microtubule organizing centers. Early microscopy studies reveal an acentriolar, amorphous structure although its detailed organization remains elusive. Intranuclear microtubules mediate chromosome segregation, but the small size of parasite nuclei has precluded detailed analysis of their arrangement by classical fluorescence microscopy. We apply recently developed STED, expansion microscopy, and live cell imaging protocols to describe the reconfiguration of microtubules during schizogony. Analysis of centrin, nuclear pore, and microtubule positioning reveals a bipartite organization of the centriolar plaque. While centrin is extranuclear, we confirm by correlative light and electron tomography that microtubules are nucleated in a previously unknown and extended intranuclear compartment, which is devoid of chromatin. This study enables us to build a working model of the organization of an unconventional centrosome and better understand the diversity of eukaryotic cell division modes.",

Starvation of M. tuberculosis deleted for either argB or argF genes led to rapid sterilization of these strains in mice while Chemical inhibition of ArgJ with Pranlukast was also found to clear chronic M. tuberculosis infection in animal models. In this work, the ligandability of four enzymes of the pathway ArgB, ArgC, ArgD and ArgF is explored using a fragment-based approach. We reveal several hits for these enzymes validated with biochemical and biophysical assays, and X-ray crystallographic data, which in the case of ArgB were further confirmed to have on-target activity against M. tuberculosis.

    "abstract": "Surgical sealing and repair of injured and resected gastrointestinal (GI) organs are critical requirements for successful treatment and tissue healing. Despite being the standard of care, hand-sewn closure of GI defects using sutures faces various limitations and challenges. The process remains technically complicated and time-consuming. The needle-piercing and pointwise closure also inflict tissue damage and stress concentration, raising the risk of local failure and subsequent anastomotic leaks. To address these limitations and challenges, we introduce an off-the-shelf bioadhesive GI patch capable of atraumatic, rapid, robust, and sutureless repair of GI defects. The GI patch synergistically integrates a non-adhesive top layer and a dry bioadhesive bottom layer, resulting in a thin, flexible, transparent, and ready to use dressing with tissue-matching mechanical properties. Rapid, robust, and sutureless sealing capability of the GI patch is systematically characterized based on various standard tests in ex vivo porcine GI organ models. In vitro and in vivo rat models are utilized to validate biocompatibility and biodegradability of the GI patch including comprehensive cytotoxicity, histopathology, immunofluorescence, and blood analyses. To validate the GI patchs efficacy in a clinically relevant setting, we demonstrate successful sutureless in vivo sealing and healing of GI defects; namely in rat stomach and colon, and porcine colon injury models. The proposed GI patch not only provides a promising alternative to suture for repair of GI defects but also offers potential clinical opportunities in the treatment and repair of other organs.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryAn off-the-shelf bioadhesive patch is introduced for facile sutureless repair of gastrointestinal defects, addressing various limitations of conventional suture-based treatments.",

    "abstract": "The quality of genotyping calls resulting from DNA sequencing is reliant on high quality starting genetic material. One factor that can reduce sample quality and lead to misleading genotyping results is genetic contamination of a sample by another source, such as cells or DNA from another sample of the same or different species. Cross-sample contamination by individuals of the same species is particularly difficult to detect in DNA sequencing data, because the contaminating sequence reads look very similar to those of the intended base sample. We introduce a new method that uses a support vector regression model trained on in silico contaminated datasets to predict empirical contamination using a collection of variables drawn from VCF files, including the fraction of sites that are heterozygous, the fraction of heterozygous sites with imbalanced allele counts, and parameters describing distributions fit to heterozygous allele fractions in a sample.

    "abstract": "Engineered proteins generally must possess a stable structure in order to achieve their designed function. Stable designs, however, are astronomically rare within the space of all possible amino acid sequences. As a consequence, many designs must be tested computationally and experimentally in order to find stable ones, which is expensive in terms of time and resources. Here we report a neural network model that predicts protein stability based only on sequences of amino acids, and demonstrate its performance by evaluating the stability of almost 200,000 novel proteins. These include a wide range of sequence perturbations, providing a baseline for future work in the field. We also report a second neural network model that is able to generate novel stable proteins. Finally, we show that the predictive model can be used to substantially increase the stability of both expert-designed and model-generated proteins.",

    "abstract": "Predicting disease progression remains a particularly challenging endeavor in chronic degenerative disorders and cancer, thus limiting early detection, risk stratification, and preventive interventions. Here, profiling the spectrum of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) as a model, we identify the blood platelet transcriptome as a proxy for highly sensitive progression biomarkers that also enables prediction of advanced disease via machine learning algorithms. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we derive disease-relevant gene expression in purified platelets from 120 peripheral blood samples constituting two time-separated cohorts of patients diagnosed with one of three MPN subtypes at sample acquisition - essential thrombocythemia, ET (n=24), polycythemia vera, PV (n=33), and primary or post ET/PV secondary myelofibrosis, MF (n=42), and healthy donors (n=21). The MPN platelet transcriptome reveals an incremental molecular reprogramming that is independent of patient driver mutation status or therapy and discriminates each clinical phenotype. Leveraging this dataset that shows a characteristic progressive expression gradient across MPN, we develop a machine learning model (Lasso-penalized regression) and predict advanced subtype MF at high accuracy and under two conditions of external validation: i) temporal: our two Stanford cohorts, AUC-ROC of 0.96; and ii) geographical: independently published data of an additional n=25 MF and n=46 healthy donors, AUC-ROC of 0.97). Lasso-derived signatures offer a robust core set of < 5 MPN transcriptome markers that are progressive in expression. Mechanistic insights from our data highlight impaired protein homeostasis as a prominent driver of MPN evolution, with persistent integrated stress response. We also identify JAK inhibitor-specific signatures and other interferon, proliferation, and proteostasis-associated markers as putative targets for MPN-directed therapy. Our platelet transcriptome snapshot of chronic MPNs demonstrates a proof of principle for disease risk stratification and progression beyond genetic data alone, with potential utility in other progressive disorders.\n\nHighlightsLeveraging two independent and mutually validating MPN patient cohorts, we identify progressive transcriptomic markers that also enable externally validated prediction in MPNs.\n\nOur platelet RNA-Seq data identifies impaired protein homeostasis as prominent in MPN progression and offers putative targets of therapy.\n\nVISUAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=135 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/435190v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@72dc16org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cf5096org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b3d460org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3c0ddc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory elements play a key role in orchestrating gene expression during cellular differentiation, but what determines their function over time remains largely unknown. Here, we performed perturbation-based massively parallel reporter assays at seven early time points of neural differentiation to systematically characterize how regulatory elements and motifs within them guide cellular differentiation. By perturbing over 2,000 putative DNA binding motifs in active regulatory regions, we delineated four categories of functional elements, and observed that activity direction is mostly determined by the sequence itself, while the magnitude of effect depends on the cellular environment. We also find that fine-tuning transcription rates is often achieved by a combined activity of adjacent activating and repressing elements. Our work provides a blueprint for the sequence components needed to induce different transcriptional patterns in general and specifically during neural differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the short-term dynamics of excitatory synapses over development have been observed throughout cortex, but their purpose and consequences remain unclear. Here, we propose that developmental changes in synaptic dynamics buffer the effect of slow inhibitory long-term plasticity, allowing for continuously stable neural activity. Using computational modelling we demonstrate that early in development excitatory short-term depression quickly stabilises neural activity, even in the face of strong, unbalanced excitation. We introduce a model of the commonly observed developmental shift from depression to facilitation and show that neural activity remains stable throughout development, while inhibitory synaptic plasticity slowly balances excitation, consistent with experimental observations. Our model predicts changes in the input responses from phasic to phasic-and-tonic and more precise spike timings. We also observe a gradual emergence of synaptic working memory mediated by short-term facilitation. We conclude that the developmental depression-to-facilitation shift may control excitation-inhibition balance throughout development with important functional consequences.",

    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the viral pathogen responsible for the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To date, it is estimated that over 113 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and over 2.5 million human deaths have been recorded worldwide. Currently, three vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use only. However much of the pathogenesis observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection remains elusive. To gain insight into the contribution of individual accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we used our recently described reverse genetics system approach to successfully engineer recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2, where we individually removed viral 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, and 8 ORF proteins, and characterized these recombinant viruses in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate differences in plaque morphology, with ORF deficient ({Delta}ORF) viruses producing smaller plaques than those of the wild-type (rSARS-CoV-2/WT). However, growth kinetics of {Delta}ORF viruses were like those of rSARS-CoV-2/WT. Interestingly, infection of K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice with the {Delta}ORF rSARS-CoV-2 identified ORF3a and ORF6 as the major contributors of viral pathogenesis, while {Delta}ORF7a, {Delta}ORF7b and {Delta}ORF8 rSARS-CoV-2 induced comparable pathology to rSARS-CoV-2/WT. This study demonstrates the robustness of our reverse genetics system to generate rSARS-CoV-2 and the major role for ORF3a and ORF6 in viral pathogenesis, providing important information for the generation of attenuated forms of SARS-CoV-2 for their implementation as live-attenuated vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19.\n\nIMPORTANCEDespite great efforts put forward worldwide to combat the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to be a human health and socioeconomic threat. Insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and contribution of viral proteins to disease outcome remains elusive. Our study aims to determine the contribution of SARS-CoV-2 accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins in viral pathogenesis and disease outcome, and develop a synergistic platform combining our robust reverse genetics system to generate recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 with a validated rodent model of infection and disease. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and ORF6 contribute to lung pathology and ultimately disease outcome in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice, while ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8 have little impact on disease outcome. Moreover, our combinatory platform serves as the foundation to generate attenuated forms of the virus to develop live-attenuated vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Female age is the single greatest factor influencing reproductive performance. It is widely known that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in reproductive senescence. Ovarian bioenergetics includes a sophisticated metabolic synergism between oocytes and human mural granulosa cells (GCs), which is crucial for oocyte maturation during follicular growth. These cells are believed to be potential biomarkers of oocyte quality. It has been proposed that alterations in their energy metabolism could lead to infertility. We investigated if there is an age-related effect on the energy metabolism of human mural granulosa cells. We performed an observational prospective cohort and experimental study including 127 women that underwent in vitro fertilization cycles allocated to two groups: a control group comprising oocyte donors aged less than 35 years and a group of infertile women aged over 38 years. The bioenergetics of cumulus cells and purified mural GCs were determined from oxidative phosphorylation parameters, aerobic glycolysis and adenine nucleotide levels. We have found that human mural GCs and cumulus cells present a high glycolytic profile and that the follicular fluid is critical to sustain their energy metabolism. GCs from older women present lower mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis than those from young donors which is not accompanied by a lower respiratory capacity. The diminished energy metabolism leads to a decrease in the total cellular energy charge. We conclude that, as women age, mural granulosa cells exhibit a reduction in their energy metabolism that is likely to influence female reproductive potential.",

    "abstract": "Plasmids are mobile genetic elements that play a key role in microbial ecology and evolution by mediating horizontal transfer of important genes, such as antimicrobial resistance genes. Many microbial genomes have been sequenced by short read sequencers and have resulted in a mix of contigs that derive from plasmids or chromosomes. New tools that accurately identify plasmids are needed to elucidate new plasmid-borne genes of high biological importance. We have developed Deeplasmid, a deep learning tool for distinguishing plasmids from bacterial chromosomes based on the DNA sequence and its encoded biological data. It requires as input only assembled sequences generated by any sequencing platform and assembly algorithm and its runtime scales linearly with the number of assembled sequences. Deeplasmid achieves an AUC-ROC of over 93%, and it was much more precise than the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, as a proof of concept, we used Deeplasmid to predict new plasmids in the fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri ATCC 29473 that has no annotated plasmids. Deeplasmid predicted with high reliability that a long assembled contig is part of a plasmid. Using long read sequencing we indeed validated the existence of a 102 Kbp long plasmid, demonstrating Deeplasmids ability to detect novel plasmids.\n\nAvailabilityThe software is available with a BSD license: deeplasmid.sourceforge.io.

    "abstract": "Inspired by heterogeneity in biological neural networks, we explore a heterogeneous network consisting of receipt, transmission and computation layers. It reconciles the dilemma that the data analysis scheme for empirical records yields non-power laws when applied to microscopic simulation of critical neural dynamics. Detailed analysis shows that the reconciliation is due to synchronization effect of the feedforward connectivity. The network favours avalanches with denser activity in the first half of life, and the result is consistent with the experimental observation. This heterogeneous structure facilitates robust criticality against external stimuli, which implies the inappropriateness of interpreting the subcritcality signature as an indication of subcrtical dynamics. These results propose the network heterogeneity as an essential piece for understanding the brain criticality.",

    "abstract": "The development of effective vaccines against fungal infections requires the induction of protective, pathogen-specific cell mediated immune responses. Here, we asked whether combination adjuvants based on delta inulin (Advax) formulated with TLR agonists could improve vaccine protection mediated by a fungal recombinant protein, Bl-Eng2, which itself harbors an immunodominant antigen and Dectin-2 agonist/adjuvant. We found that Bl-Eng2 formulated with Advax3 containing TLR9 agonist or Advax8, containing TLR4 agonist, provided the best protection against pulmonary infection with Blastomyces dermatitidis, being more effective than Freunds complete adjuvant or Adjuplex. Advax3 was most efficient in inducing IFN-{gamma} and IL-17 producing antigen-specific T cells that migrated to the lung upon Blastomyces dermatitidis infection. Mechanistic studies revealed Bl-Eng2/Advax3 protection was tempered by neutralization of IL-17 and particularly IFN-{gamma}. Likewise, greater numbers of lung-resident T cells producing IFN-{gamma}, IL-17, or IFN-{gamma}+ and IL-17+ correlated with fewer fungi recovered from lung. Protection was maintained after depletion of CD4+ T cells, partially reduced by depletion of CD8+ T cells, and completely eliminated after depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We conclude that Bl-Eng2 formulated with Advax3 is promising for eliciting vaccine-induced antifungal immunity, through a previously uncharacterized mechanism involving CD8+ and also CD4+ T cells producing IFN-{gamma} and/or IL-17. Although no licensed vaccine exists as yet against any fungal disease, these findings indicate the importance of adjuvant selection for the development of effective fungal vaccines.\n\nIMPORTANCEFungal disease remains a challenging clinical and public health problem. Despite medical advances, invasive fungal infections have skyrocketed over the last decade and pose a mounting health threat in immune-competent and -deficient hosts with worldwide mortality rates ranking 7th, even ahead of tuberculosis. The development of safe, effective vaccines remains a major hurdle for fungi. Critical barriers to progress include the lack of defined fungal antigens and suitable adjuvants. Our research is significant in identifying adjuvant combinations that elicit optimal vaccine-induced protection when formulated with a recombinant protective antigen and uncovering the mechanistic bases of the underlaying vaccine protection, which will foster the strategic development of anti-fungal vaccines.",

We compared aerosol production and virus survival for a Collison nebulizer, vibrating mesh nebulizer (VMN), and hydraulic spray atomizer (HAS). We also measured the dry size distribution of the aerosols produced, calculated the droplet sizes before evaporation and the dry size distribution from normal saline solution. Dry count median diameters of 0.25, 0.63 and 0.76 {micro}m were found for normal saline from the Collison nebulizer, VMN and HSA, respectively. The volume median diameters were 2.91, 3.2 and 2.43 {micro}m, respectively. The effect of nebulization on the viability of two influenza A viruses (IAVs) (H1N1, H3N2) and human rhinovirus (HRV)-16, was assessed by direct nebulization into an SKC Biosampler. The HSA had least impact on surviving fractions (SFs) of H1N1 and H3N2 (89{+/-}5%, 94{+/-}3%), followed by the Collison nebulizer (82{+/-}2%, 82{+/-}3%). The VMN yielded SFs of 78{+/-}2% and 76{+/-}2%, respectively. Conversely, for HRV-16, the VMN produced higher SFs (86{+/-}15%). Our findings indicate that although the VMN had the greatest impact on IAV survival, it produced higher aerosol concentrations within the airborne-size range making it more suitable where high aerosol mass production is required.\n\nImportanceViral respiratory tract infections cause millions of lost days of work and physician visits globally, accounting for significant morbidity and mortality. Respiratory droplet and droplet nuclei from infected hosts are the substantial potential carriers of such viruses within indoor environments. Laboratory-generated bioaerosols are applied in understanding the transmission and infection of viruses, simulating the physiological aspects of bioaerosol generation in a controlled environment. However, little comparative characterization exists for nebulizers used in infectious disease aerobiology, including Collison nebulizer, Vibrating mesh nebulizer, and hydraulic spray atomizer. This study characterized the physical features of aerosols generated by laboratory nebulizers, and their performance in producing aerosols at a size relevant to airborne transmission used in infectious disease aerobiology. We also determined the impact of nebulization mechanisms of these nebulizers on the viability of human respiratory viruses, including IAV H1N1, IAV H3N2 and HRV-16.",

Here, we describe epigenetic clocks for horses, based on methylation profiles of CpGs with flanking DNA sequences that are highly conserved between multiple mammalian species. Methylation levels of these CpGs were measured using a custom-designed Infinium array (HorvathMammalMethylChip40). We generated 336 DNA methylation profiles from 42 different horse tissues and body parts, which we used to develop five epigenetic clocks for horses: a multi-tissue clock, a blood clock, a liver clock and two dual-species clocks that apply to both horses and humans. Epigenetic age measured by these clocks show that while castration affects the basal methylation levels of individual cytosines, it does not exert a significant impact on the epigenetic aging rate of the horse. We observed that most age-related CpGs are adjacent to developmental genes. Consistently, these CpGs reside in bivalent chromatin domains and polycomb repressive targets, which are elements that control expression of developmental genes. The availability of an RNA expression atlas of these tissues allowed us to correlate CpG methylation, their corresponding contextual chromatin features and gene expression. This analysis revealed that while increased methylation of CpGs in enhancers is likely to repress gene expression, methylation of CpGs in bivalent chromatin domains on the other hand is likely to stimulate expression of the corresponding downstream loci, which are often developmental genes. This supports the notion that aging may be accompanied by increased expression of developmental genes. It is expected that the epigenetic clocks will be useful for identifying and validating anti-aging interventions for horses.",

We found that loss of TCF-1 in all T cells in mice leads to expansion of these cells in multiple tissues in a cell-intrinsic fashion. This effect was not due to aberrant expression of FOXP3, as other functional Treg markers were also expressed. In addition, presence of TCF-1-deficient cells in a chimeric mouse induced increased production of noncanonical Tregs from WT donor cells. Therefore, targeting of TCF-1 may remove suppression on this Treg lineage, increasing the yield of these cells for use in the clinic.\n\nSummary sentenceLoss of TCF-1 causes expansion of CD25- FOXP3+ noncanonical Tregs, and TCF-1-deficient T cells induce increased production of CD25- Tregs from WT cells.",

    "abstract": "Genotype x Environment (GxE) interactions occur when environmental conditions drastically change the effect of a genetic variant. In order to truly understand the effect of genetic variation, we need to incorporate multiple environments into our analyses. Many variants, under steady state conditions, may be silent or even have the opposite effect under stress conditions. This study uses an in vivo mouse model to investigate how the effect of genetic variation changes with tissue type and cellular stress. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurs when misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER. This triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), a large transcriptional response which attempts to return the cell to homeostasis. This transcriptional response, despite being a well conserved, basic cellular process, is highly variable across different genetic backgrounds, making it an ideal system to study GxE effects. In this study, we sought to better understand how genetic variation alters expression across tissues, in the presence and absence of ER stress. The use of different mouse strains and their F1s allow us to also identify context specific cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms underlying variable transcriptional responses. We found hundreds of genes that respond to ER stress in a tissue- and/or genotype-dependent manner. Genotype-dependent ER stress-responsive genes are enriched for processes such as protein folding, apoptosis, and protein transport, indicating that some of the variability occurs in canonical ER stress factors. The majority of regulatory mechanisms underlying these variable transcriptional responses derive from cis-regulatory variation and are unique to a given tissue or ER stress state. This study demonstrates the need for incorporating multiple environments in future studies to better elucidate the effect of any particular genetic factor in basic biological pathways, like the ER stress response.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe effect of genetic variation is dependent on environmental context. Here we use genetically diverse mouse strains to understand how genetic variation interacts with stress state to produce variable transcriptional profiles. In this study, we take advantage of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response which is a large transcriptional response to misfolded proteins. Using this system, we uncovered tissue- and ER stress-specific effects of genetic variation on gene expression. Genes with genotype-dependent variable expression levels in response to ER stress were enriched for canonical ER stress functions, such as protein folding and transport. These variable effects of genetic variation are driven by unique sets of regulatory variation that are only active under context-specific circumstances. The results of this study highlight the importance of including multiple environments and genetic backgrounds when studying the ER stress response and other cellular pathways.",

What underpins the communication between the two partners? In angiosperms, the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) is a well-known regulator of plant-microbe interactions. Using HPLC-MS/MS, we pinpoint the presence of SA in the fern; using comparative genomics and phylogenetics, we mined homologs of SA biosynthesis genes across Chloroplastida (Viridiplantae). While canonical isochorismate synthase (ICS) sequences are largely limited to angiosperms, homologs for the entire Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL)-dependent pathway likely existed in the last common ancestor of land plants. Indeed, A. filiculoides secondarily lost its ICS, but has the genetic competence to derive SA from benzoic acid.

The emotion tasks required them to categorise five emotions conveyed by nonverbal vocalisations (e.g., laughter, crying) and speech prosody: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, plus neutrality. Socio-emotional adjustment was independently evaluated by the childrens teachers using a multi-dimensional questionnaire of self-regulation and social behaviour. Based on frequentist and Bayesian analyses, we found that higher emotion recognition in speech prosody related to better general socio-emotional adjustment. This association remained significant even after accounting for the childrens general cognitive ability, age, sex, and parental education in multiple regressions. Follow-up analyses indicated that the advantages were particularly robust for the socio-emotional dimensions prosocial behaviour and cognitive and behavioural self-regulation. For emotion recognition in nonverbal vocalisations, no associations with socio-emotional adjustment were found. Overall, these results support the close link between childrens emotional prosody recognition skills and their everyday social behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Most human genetic variation is classified as VUS - variants of uncertain significance. While advances in genome editing have allowed innovation in pooled screening platforms, many screens deal with relatively simple readouts (viability, fluorescence) and cannot identify the complex cellular phenotypes that underlie most human diseases. In this paper, we present a generalizable functional genomics platform that combines high-content imaging, machine learning, and microraft isolation in a new method termed \"Raft-Seq\". We highlight the efficacy of our platform by showing its ability to distinguish pathogenic point mutations of the mitochondrial regulator MFN2, even when the cellular phenotype is subtle. We also show that our platform achieves its efficacy using multiple cellular features, which can be configured on-the-fly. Raft-Seq enables a new way to perform pooled screening on sets of mutations in biologically relevant cells, with the ability to physically capture any cell with a perturbed phenotype and expand it clonally, directly from the primary screen.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=121 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/434746v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c774b4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bee63corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fd7099org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@eb7d87_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Here, we address the need to evaluate the impact of numerous genetic variants.

    "abstract": "Cognitive decline is a common trait of neurodegenerative diseases of central nervous system and one of the major risk factors associated with faster phenoconversion from prodromal stages. In the transition to full-blown clinical syndromes, increased phase synchronization in the theta, alpha or beta EEG rhythms is thought to reflect the activation of compensatory mechanisms that may counterbalance the cognitive decline of patients affected by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Patients suffering from idiopathic Rapid eye-movement sleep Behavior Disorder (iRBD) have high risk of developing Parkinson Disease (PD) or Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and cognitive impairment is among the strongest risk factors together with motor symptoms. Here we wanted to investigate whether altered phase synchronization and amplitude couplings of the brain oscillations could be linked to the balancing of cognitive decline in a longitudinal cohort (N=18) of iRBD patients. We measured high-density Electroencephalographic (HD-EEG) activity at baseline and follow-up and quantified power distribution, orthogonalized amplitude correlation and weighted phase lag index. Despite the overt neurodegenerative progression (three patients converted to PD and one to DLB), cognitive decline was not evident from Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) or neuropsychological tests. On the other hand, alpha phase synchronization and delta amplitude correlations were significantly different at follow-up compared to baseline. In particular, alpha synchrony was enhanced while delta amplitude coupling was reduced. Those differences were more pronounced among central-posterior channels while frontal channels showed a reduced number of significant edges with respect to surrogates. Both large-scale amplitude and phase coupling significantly correlated with cognitive or neuropsychological scores but not with sleep quality indices. Altogether, these results suggest that increased alpha phase-synchronization and reduced delta amplitude correlation may be considered as electrophysiological signs of an active compensatory mechanism of the cognitive impairment in RDB patients. Large-scale functional modifications could thus be used as significant biomarker in the characterization of prodromal stages of PD.\n\nStatement of SignificanceCognitive impairment and RBD emerge much earlier than the better-known motor symptoms distinctive of synucleinopathies. An improved investigation of RBD may constitute an important biomarker for an early diagnosis of the actual neurodegenerative diseases. For the first time, this preliminary study aims to quantify the large-scale network couplings as electrophysiological manifestation of the compensatory mechanism to the cognitive impairment in a longitudinal study of idiopathic RBD patients. Unfortunately, the small number of the subjects limits the generalizability of our observations, but this is only preliminary works in a larger project that aims to investigate advanced electrophysiological markers for an early diagnosis of the synucleinopathies.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral flexibility, the ability to modify behavior according to changing conditions, is essential to optimize decision-making. Deficits in behavioral flexibility that persist into adulthood are one consequence of adolescent alcohol exposure, and another is decreased functional connectivity in brain structures involved in decision-making; however, a link between these two outcomes has not been established. We assessed effects of adolescent alcohol and sex on both Pavlovian and instrumental behaviors and functional connectivity in adult animals to determine associations between behavioral flexibility and resting-state functional connectivity. Alcohol exposure impaired attentional set reversals and decreased functional connectivity among cortical and subcortical regions-of-interest that underlie flexible behavior. Moreover, mediation analyses indicated that adolescent alcohol-induced reductions in functional connectivity within a subnetwork of affected brain regions mediated errors committed during reversal learning. These results provide a novel link between persistent reductions in brain functional connectivity and deficits in behavioral flexibility resulting from adolescent alcohol exposure.",
